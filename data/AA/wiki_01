Gustave Borgnis-Desbordes

Gustave Borgnis-Desbordes (22 October 1839 – 18 July 1900) was a French general. He was a major figure in the French Imperial conquest of the French Soudan, modern Mali. He was "Commandant-Superior" of the French Military Territory of Haut-Sénégal (French territory of Upper Senegal), attached to the colonial government of Senegal, 1880 to 1883.
Early career.
Born into a family from Morlaix, Gustave's grandfater was a Deputy from Finistère, and his father was a military engineer trained at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique. Gustave also graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique on 18 October 1859, and went on to the Army Artillery School at Metz. He received his first commission to the Troupes de marine transferred to a Marine regiment at the naval base in Toulon, with the rank of Capitan. From 16 February 1868 to 1 March 1871, Borgnis-Desbordes was assigned to units fighting in the French colonial campaign in Cochinchine (Vietnam). In 1871, following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, he was made adjutant to General Frébault in Paris. He was made "Chef d'escadron" in 1875 and promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel.
Senegal and French Soudan.
Borgnis-Desbordes is most remembered as a daring and restless commander of the French colonial expansion into the Middle Niger River Valley. He served as a Lieutenant-Colonel under the Governor of Senegal Louis Brière de l'Isle (1876–1881). Between 1880 and 1883 Borgnis-Desbordes was "Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve", Commander of the Military Territory of Haut Senegal, which was later expanded to the east and rechristened French Soudan in 1890. He founded the French forts at Kita (1881) and Bamako (1883), which became two of the key towns of French Soudan. In the process he launched a series of military campaigns against the remnants of the regional power of the Tukulor Empire, which was finally overthrown by Colonel Louis Archinard in 1890.
Under the governor of Senegal.
Under both Brière de l'Isle in Senegal, and as chief officer in the Soudan, Borgnis-Desbordes developed a reputation for violence and insubordination, leading the territorial expansion of French power in the absence of, and sometimes in direct contradiction of the Ministry of Marine, the government arm which controlled colonial forces. 
Borgnis-Desbordes led the French conquest of the remnants of the Imamate of Futa Toro, along what is today the northeastern border of Senegal, which Briere de l'Isle ordered in contradiction of government directives. In 1878 Borgnis-Desbordes led a French force against the Kaarta Toucouleur vassal state along the north bank of the Senegal River. Blocked by the colonial minister in Paris, Briere de l'Isle argued that Kaarta was a threat to the new protectorate in Fouta Tooro, and that British agents were infiltrating the area. The Ministry gave in, and on 7 July 1878, Borgnis-Desbordes forces destroyed the Kaarta Toucouleur fort at Sabouciré, killing their leader, Almany Niamody. This portion of the Kaarta vassals were then incorporated into the Khasso Wolof protectorate kingdom.
Commander of the first French Soudan colony.
As Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve, Borgnis-Desbordes attack on Bamako in 1880 was the trigger for Brière de l'Isle's dismissal, and his attack on Samory Touré's forces in 1883 began a conflict which only ended in 1893.
Under Brière de l'Isle: 1881.
When Brière de l'Isle appointed Borgnis-Desbordes "Commandant-Superieur du Haut-Fleuve" on 6 September 1880, he was also given the rank of Lt. Colonel, outranking all other French officials in the area, essentially appointing him a Lieutenant Governor. of all territory to the east of Senegal, beginning at the conluence of the Senegal River and Falémé. Borgnis-Desbordes arrived in Bafoulabé on 1 January 1881, and moved his forces onto Kita on 7 February, where he established his headquarters. From his base in Kita, Borgnis-Desbordes had the authority to conduct all aspects of French policy in the Soudan, including exploration, railway construction and defense.
With a battalion of Tirailleurs sénégalais at his command, Borgnis-Desbordes set about the work of establishing bases all along the proposed Dakar-Niger Railway, bringing African states under French rule, and scouting for a rail terminus on the Niger River.
In 1881, within two weeks of receiving the order to halt at Kita, he destroyed the village of Goubanko, fifteen kilometers to the east. This was the instigation for Brière de l'Isle's removal by Minister Cloué. Cloué ordered Brière de l'Isle to pull back Borgnis-Desbordes forces, the Lt. Colonel did so, complaing to his commanders. In fact, Cloué had given strict orders that no movement to the east would take place as fellow Marine officer Joseph Gallieni was then in Segu, negotiating a trade treaty with the Toukolor leaders, and under virtual house arrest.
Borgnis-Desbordes returned to Paris in mid-1881, but instead of being punished, the Ministry began to throw their weight behind him. In fact, be became their expert on the Soudan, (Gallieni was now in Martinique recovering from his long stay in Segu) and Borgnis-Desbordes briefings carried much weight. The Lt. Colonel told the Ministry, then planning a series of slow topographical expeditions and enabling peace treaties for the rail line, that "The Peaceful conquest of the Niger is an illusion."
Second expedition to the Niger.
Borgnis-Desbordes arrived in Saint-Louis in the midst of typhoid and then yellow fever outbreaks, causing his planned July mission to be suspended. The epidemics also killed the new Governor of Senegal, Rear-Admiral Delanneau, and led to disorder which his replacement, Colonel Canard, could not quell. While this pushed back Borgnis-Desbordes's plans, by 1882, he had cemented his position. The Ministry had no strong leader in Senegal, and Borgnis-Desbordes now had influence in Paris. His plan to build a fort past Kita was accepted, although his fort at Bamako was still blocked. The Lt. Colonel sent a column that reached the Niger, crossed the river, and attacked forces of Samory Toure that were besieging a local leader at Keniéra. According to Borgnis-Desbordes, this was a punishment for a raid by Samory's troops on Galleini's expedition the previous year. Although reprimanded, Borgnis-Desbordes was too crucial to the Ministry's plans to be removed. The longer-term consequences were more grave. This began an ongoing war with Samory that lasted until 1898, the longest conflict in France's African conquest. 
In early March 1882, the French government approved funding for the railway (even at 7,500,000 francs, a doubling of previous requests), and placed Jauréguiberry, a former Governor of Senegal and supporter of expansion, as Minister of Marine. In May 1882, Governor Canard was replaced with Captain Vallon. Borgnis-Desbordes' push to occupy Bamako was again put off by the Ministry but the plan was supported by the Minister's advisors, Lt. Colonel Bourdiaux Director of Colonies Paul Dislère. After another visit to Paris in July–August 1882, Borgnis-Desbordes got his way, convincing leaders that only continued expansion would enable the rail project to be built in a timely manner. In August, Jauréguiberry ordered the occupation of Bamako without consulting Vallon, and Borgnis-Desbordes quickly made Vallon recognise his authority, forcing the governor to provide Senegal's garrison for the expansion in the Soudan, under Borgnis-Desbordes's command. Vallon resigned in the fall, and was replaced with René Servatius, the former attorney general of Martinique who had been forced to resign in a scandal, giving Borgnis-Desbordes all the political capital.
Borgnis-Desbordes attacked the Toukolor fortress at Murgala in December 1882, risking the reignition of war with the major empire of the central Niger valley. Marching to the east, Borgnis-Desbordes captured Daba in Beledougou, reached the Niger and began construction of the Fort at Bamako on 1 February 1883. On 19 April, Bamako was connected to Senegal by telegraph lines. Samory's forces attacked the new fort in April but were repulsed, freeing Borgnis-Desbordes troops to range far south of the Niger, and enabling him to force protectorate status on most of Beledougou. When word of the Bamako expedition reached France, Borgnis-Desbordes became a hero. Having secured the a rail line to the Niger, he returned to Paris, was promoted to Colonel, and was made head of the Haut-Senegal and Niger division of the Ministry.
Indochina (1884-1900).
In 1884 he was transferred to Tonkin (northern Vietnam) in what became French Indochina. Borgnis-Desbordes was a commander during the Sino-French War, serving under his mentor Louis Brière de l'Isle, now commander of forces in the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. After the defeat at the March 1885 Battle of Bang Bo, and the removal of Brière de l'Isle, Borgnis-Desbordes remained in Indochina and was promoted to Général de brigade in 1886. On 1 January 1889 he was made Commander in Chief of Troops in Indochina, and in 1890, "Général de division". An adamant colonialist to the end, he is famously quoted as saying the War in Indochina "was a case of seeing what you wanted and taking it." Retiring from this command, he died in Hanoi on 18 July 1900.
Monuments.
Several streets are named for Borgnis-Desbordes in France, including the "Rue Borgnis-Desbordes" near the "Borgnis-Desbordes Army Barracks" in Versailles. His bust is also displayed in the "Hotel de Ville" in Versailles. "Rue Borgnis-Desbordes" in Dakar, Senegal has survived independence, ironically forming an intersection with "Rue Brière de l'Isle". A statue of Borgnis-Desbordes in Bamako, commemorating his capture of the town in 1883, was torn down shortly after Mali's independence.

The Dolphins of Laurentum

The Dolphins of Laurentum is a historical novel by Caroline Lawrence published on February 6, 2003 by Orion Books. It is the fifth novel in the The Roman Mysteries series.
Plot.
October, AD 79: Flavia Gemina and her friends Nubia, Jonathan, and Lupus, are enjoying dinner together at Flavia’s home, when a bedraggled stranger stumbles through the front door. To Flavia’s horror, the man is her own father, Geminus, who has been shipwrecked and severely injured. With the aid of Jonathan’s father, Dr. Mordecai, Marcus makes a gradual recovery. But more bad news arrives: not only has her father’s ship been lost with all hands and its cargo, Marcus’s bank announces that it is calling in the loan on the ship immediately, or else they will seize his house and property. Flavia’s uncle Gaius convinces the bank to give them one extra week, but no longer.
Everyone is suddenly in need of money: Gaius doesn’t feel able to marry Jonathan’s sister, Miriam, after his farm was lost in the eruption of Vesuvius; Nubia is shocked to recognize her elder brother, Tarhaqo, among a group of slaves being sold in the market; Lupus is enraged to learn that his hated enemy, the slave dealer Venalicius, has bribed his way out of prison. Lupus wants to hire an assassin, but the man names an impossible price for his services.
The family’s dismal mood is lifted by the arrival of a young stranger: Pliny the Younger, the nephew of Admiral Pliny, who has just inherited his uncle’s property. Remembering their friendship with his uncle before his death, and keen to hear their accounts of his last days, Pliny invites Marcus to his villa in Laurentum to recuperate, including the children, Miriam, and the children’s teacher Aristo. Mordecai endorses the suggestion gratefully, while Gaius remains behind in Ostia to sort out the financial mess.
When the family arrives at Laurentum, they are delighted to meet Phrixus, Admiral Pliny’s slave, who has just received his freedom. Over dinner, the family play music and tell stories to entertain each other, and Marcus, with coaxing, tells of how he was shipwrecked. As he regrets the loss of his cargo, Pliny muses about the treasures lost under the sea, mentioning that there is a shipwreck visible under the water, just off the coast from the villa. It was rumored to be carrying a cargo of gold, but it is sunk too deep for any of the local fisherman to reach it.
Elated, Lupus reveals to the others that he is Greek in origin, born on the island of Symi, and, like his father before him, is a trained diver. With his instruction, the others equip a boat to take to the wreck site. During his first dive, he manages to reach the wreck, something no other local has managed to do, though he considers himself out of practice.
Pliny insists on having a celebratory feast on the beach. That night, the four friends are enchanted to see phosphorescent plankton lighting up the beach, and when they all jump into the ocean, find themselves swimming with dolphins. Aristo is cajoled to tell several Greek myths having to do with dolphins during their lessons, including the stories of Arion and Delphinus, and of Poseidon and Amphitrite.
With practice, Lupus makes several dives of increasing duration, managing to reach the wreck several times, but unable to retrieve any of the amphorae he finds inside. With Aristo’s help, Jonathan designs a float rope to attach to the vessels, but everyone becomes alarmed when Lupus begins showing signs of pressure sickness. Aristo orders him to rest before his next dive, but Lupus becomes sullen and obsessed with retrieving the treasure, even snubbing his friends when they want to play music or go swimming with the dolphins again.
On his last dive, Lupus is attacked by an octopus inside the wreck, losing his lifeline. He fights off the octopus, but loses consciousness underwater. A friendly dolphin nudges him to the surface, and Jonathan is able to revive him with artificial respiration.
When they return to the villa, Aristo misconstrues an exchange between Miriam and Pliny, and the two men begin fighting over her. Furious, Miriam tells them to stop and runs off by herself. 
Then Gaius arrives at the farm with grave news: the “assassin” that Lupus tried to hire was in fact an agent of the local magistrate, Bato, who deliberately named an impossible sum to prevent Lupus from trying to hire him. Gaius is now worried that Lupus is obsessed with finding enough money to have Venalicius killed, so much that he will injure or kill himself diving to the wreck.
When Flavia and the others wonder why Lupus hates Venalicius so much, Gaius has a startling document to show them: last month, Mordecai was in jail on a wrongful charge (during "The Assassins of Rome"). Venalicius was his cellmate, and narrated a confession that Mordecai wrote down:
Venalicius’s real name is Phillippos, Lupus’s uncle. When he was a boy on Symi, he was abused and laughed at because of his ugliness, except by one girl, Melissa. Because he was a good diver, Phillippos wanted to find a pearl for Melissa being so nice to him, but ended up rupturing one of his eyes from pressure sickness. Now even uglier, he was even more abused by his father, who later sold him as a slave. Years later, Phillippos returned to the island, now free, and a rich and ruthless slave dealer. He was enraged to find that his handsome younger brother had married Melissa, and killed him. Melissa’s son yelled that he would tell on his uncle, and Phillippos grabbed the boy and cut his tongue out, telling Melissa that the boy would die if anyone followed him. He then sailed away, and the boy escaped when the ship reached Ostia.
Lupus has overheard Gaius’s reading, and adds one detail: Venalicius had told him that his mother was also dead; now knowing that this isn’t true, Lupus realizes she may be alive somewhere.
Now more determined than ever to retrieve the treasure, Lupus sneaks out of the villa and hires one of the fishermen to take him to the wreck. When he gets there, he is shocked to see Dr. Mordecai and Venalicius together. Venalicius dives into the water, and Mordecai yells at Lupus to stop, Venalicius is trying to help them. Ignoring this, Lupus dives and races his uncle to the wreck. Once there, Lupus sees the octopus attacking his uncle.
Somewhat to his own surprise, Lupus stabs the octopus and drives it away. When Venalicius is brought up, he begins to suffer terrible pains, as he has made many more dives that day than is safe. Lupus realizes his uncle is dying; before he does, he begs his nephew to forgive him. Lupus does, reluctantly, and agrees to perform the last rites.
The treasure is never recovered, but the family’s problems are still solved: Flavia secretly sells her most prized possession, a kylix she received from Publius Pollius Felix (in "The Pirates of Pompeii") to Pliny in exchange for enough money to anonymously pay off her father’s loan; Pliny makes Gaius tenant on one of his farms, so he can afford to marry Miriam; and Mordecai informs Lupus that, before he died, Venalicius accepted Christian baptism and willed all of his money and possessions to his nephew, including his ship. Lupus makes Marcus the new captain of his ship (re-christened the "Delphina"), and agrees to carry out his uncle’s dying wish of rescuing all the children he abducted and sold into slavery. The only one saddened is Nubia, who learns that her brother was sold to a gladiator school in Capua.
The next morning, Flavia, Jonathan, and Nubia read a note left by Lupus telling what little he remembers from that terrible night: after his uncle’s ship left Symi, some of the other sailors had to stop the bleeding in his mouth by cauterizing the stub of his tongue: "I opened my mouth because I thought that it couldn’t hurt any worse than it already did. But I was wrong.”
They look up and are heartened to see Lupus out at sea, lifted of the burden of his hate, and taking a carefree ride on a dolphin.

Web-to-TV

A Web-to-TV installation provides a way to show web television or other over-the-top content from the Internet, to a television set. Various technologies to do this include Home theater PCs (desktop computers running more user-friendly software for TV viewing), digital media receivers (also known as "media extenders", replaying content from a local area network), and Smart TVs (television sets and set-top boxes with Internet capabilities).
Media extenders.
Several companies provide media extenders including Netgear and Dlink. Advanced game consoles - Xbox 360 from Microsoft, PS3 from Sony, and the Nintendo Wii - can be configured to stream or view content delivered from a PC on the user's home network.
LocalCasting.
A new entry from ZeeVee connects to the VGA output of a home PC/server and LocalCasts (transmits) it throughout the users house over the existing coax wiring as a normal HD Dolby 5.1 channel that is directly tunable by all connected HDTV's. A unique benefit of this approach is that no additional boxes are required at each TV because only single LocalCast device is required to insert a private channel on the homes coax distribution system. In order to do this the monitor output of the PC is digitized, MPEG2 compressed, and QAM encoded all at HD resolution and in real-time. The LocalCasting PC is controlled with an RF remote or RF keyboard that includes a pointing device to provide normal interactivity with any PC application within a range suitable for the normal home. Another important benefit of this over-the-top approach is that it provides the broadest access to internet content because it supports any content or application that can be viewed on a PC.
Video on demand.
HD Encodulators are a new class of device in Digital Video Broadcast (DVB). Encodulators are devices that bundle a digital encoder and an RF agile modulator into one package. Encodulators accept uncompressed video as either HD or SD and encode the source to an MPEG transport stream. This transport stream can be based on either MPEG-2 or MPEG-4(H.264) broadcasting codecs. Once the video is encoded it is passed on to the modulator component of the device. The agile modulator overlays the MPEG transport stream onto a high frequency carrier wave for DTV broadcast. In the US this is typically in the 50 - 900 MHz range for terrestrial television, and 900 - 2600 MHz for satellite distribution. Standards used for terrestrial broadcast are 8-level Vestigial Sideband Modulation (8VSB) for over the air, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) for cable TV. A typical example of an encodulator are the units from Thor Broadcast. These units units include both a high definition encoder and a frequency agile modulator for all major DVB modulation types. Many more manufacturers are moving to this sort of consolidated hardware platform. In the last year other manufacturers such as Comlan have released similar units. In the future we will see more and more broadcasting companies moving to consolidated equipment, both to save on rackspace and on cost.
Content subscription.
KylinTV provides a "box" that serves a number of Chinese language web channels. The service is sold on a monthly subscription basis.
Time Warner cable announced plans to offer a web to TV solution.
Internet-ready TV.
Sony Bravia Internet Link provides Web to TV without a PC.
Sony has also announced plans to integrate this functionality into future TVs. Several major TV suppliers have made similar claims. The advent of high performance, low cost processors from ARM and Intel will ultimately bring the Web to (every) TV.

Bitter Springs type preservation

The Bitter Springs preservational mode is the preservation of microorganisms in silica, in shallow Precambrian waters.
Taphonomic processes.
Silica is emplaced around the organisms very rapidly, before their cells can even collapse; the strong silica is able to withstand great pressures and preserves three-dimensional detail even after metamorphosis. Microbial mats, as they decayed, acted as nucleii for silica precipitation.
Occurrence.
The preservational mode is only present in the Precambrian, and is restricted to shallow or tidal waters.
After this point, organisms such as sponges extracted silica from the oceans in order to construct tests (skeletons), with the result that the surface oceans no longer became supersaturated with respect to silica when evaporation condensed the mineral.
Constraints.
Because microbial mats and shallow, supersaturated seas were necessary for the formation of this form of deposit, larger eukaryotic organisms could not survive in the regions in which these deposits were formed; hence the record is mainly restricted to bacteria.

Punjab Police (Pakistan)

The Punjab Police is responsible for policing in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Mission of Punjab Police is prevention and detection of crime, maintenance of law and order and enforcement of the Constitution of Pakistan. With more than 180,000 active members, it is the world's second largest police organization. 
History.
Mughal Era.
The system of policing in Mughal Era was organized on the basis of land tenure. Zamindars were responsible for apprehending disturbers of the public peace and performing other policing duties. At the level of the village these functions were performed by the village headmen. In large towns administration of the police was entrusted to, functionaries called kotwals who discharged the combined duties of law enforcement, municipal administration and revenue collection. Patrol officers in the shape of village watchmen or patels in villages and peons, horse patrolmen and such other like men in the towns were present. Violent organized crime was usually dealt with by the military.
British Era.
The modern system of policing was introduced during British Rule, The British administration relieved the zamindars of their responsibility for police service and introduced magistrates with daroghas and other subordinate officers for Police purposes.
The Punjab Police was also organized on the pattern of two main branches, the Military Preventive Police and the Civil Detective Police. As this arrangement was not found to be satisfactory so in 1860 the Government of India urged the Government of Punjab to look into the system of policing then prevalent in the Province. However, as the issue was of general importance the central Government appointed a commission to enquire into whole question of policing in British India. The Calcutta Police Commission of 1860 recommended the abolition of the Military Arm of the Police, the appointment of an Inspector General of Police in the Province and the placement of Police in a district under the District Superintendent. The Commission recommended that only the District Magistrate should exercise any Police functions. Based on the recommendations of the Commission the Government of India submitted a bill which was passed into law as Act V of 1861. The Police Act of 1861 was adopted.
The organizational design that followed the Act survives to this day.
Punjab Police Rules.
The Punjab Police Rules of 1934 documented the police practices as they stood at that time and introduced some new measures for improving administration and operational effectiveness of police. The content of the Rules reveals that the Punjab Police had grown into a thoroughly professional police organization by 1934 and possessed considerable knowledge of the crime and criminals in the province. It had developed effective procedures and practices for dealing with various kinds of criminal activity. The administrative and disciplinary functions were also elaborated. The Rules have served as the model for similar sets of rules in other provinces of Pakistan and are still in force today.
Punjab Police after Independence.
The Punjab Police played a significant part in handling the refugee crisis of 1947-48. It continued as a separate organization till 1955 when it was merged with the police of other provinces to create the West Pakistan Police. The DIG West Pakistan was Inayat Ali Shah. DIG East Pakistan and DIG West Pakistan used to report to one IG which during the decade of 1950s was Qurban Ali Khan. There were several attempts to review and reform police organization and performance during the 1950s and 60s which however could not be implemented.
The legal framework of police in Pakistan underwent a major change as a consequence of Devolution of Power Plan implemented between 2001 and 2006. The Plan provided for devolution of a considerable portion of Provincial Government's authority and functions to districts and introduction of public accountability of police.
In line with Devolution of Power Plan, the office of Deputy Commissioner of the district was abolished in 2001 and a system of district governments was introduced through the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2001. As a part of the Plan a new police law, the Police Order, replaced the Police Act 1861 in 2002. It brought sweeping changes to the police organization.

Edouard Borovansky

Edouard Borovansky (24 February 1902 – 18 December 1959) was a Czech- born Australian ballet dancer, choreographer and director. After touring with Anna Pavlova's company, he and his wife settled in Australia where they established the Borovansky Ballet company. This company provided the foundation for modern ballet in Australia and was subsequently used as the basis for the first national Australian ballet company, The Australian Ballet which was established in 1962.
Early years.
Eduard Josef Skřeček was born on 24 February 1902 in Přerov, Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the seventh child of František Skřeček, a railway clerk, and his wife Arnošta. After graduating school he worked as an accountant before he was called up for military service in the Czechoslovak Air Force. In 1921, he joined the chorus of the Olomouc Opera Company as a baritone, however as he had an early gymnastic training he was transferred to the "corps de ballet". In September 1923 he successfully auditioned for the Prague National Theatre where he began to work his way up the hierarchy before he gained a place in Anna Pavlova's touring company in 1928. He began his career as a dancer of character roles by changing his name to Eduard Borowanski. He first performed with the Pavlova Ballet in Hamburg, Germany. He then toured for seasons in Britain, South America and Asia. He first toured Australia with the company in 1929. However, the company collapsed after the death of Anna Pavlova in 1930, and he and his companion, the Russian-born Xenia Nikolayevna Krüger, née Smirnova (1903–1985), scraped a living by teaching children in makeshift studios in Paris, then Prague and Berlin. He married Krüger, a divorcee, on 14 October 1933 at the register office, Westminster, London. In 1932 he joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. His notable roles with this company were the Strong Man in "Le Beau Danube", Polkan in "Le Coq d'Or" and the Shopkeeper of "La Boutique fantasque". He revisited Australia in 1938 with the company, now renamed The Royal Covent Garden Russian Ballet, however he and his wife decided to remain in Australia at the end of the tour.
Borovansky Ballet.
After Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Borovansky and his wife Xenia felt that there was little future for ballet in the region and the outbreak of World War II a few months later gave them little incentive or opportunity to return to Europe. With his wife, he established a ballet school in Melbourne named the Melbourne Academy of Russian Ballet. Xenia was the principal teacher, while Borovansky handled the administration. By 1940 the academy had grown and Borovansky was able to establish the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company, which held its first season at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne in December of that year. The principal dancer was Laurel Martyn. The ballet company was variously called the Borovansky Ballet, the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company, the Borovansky Ballet of 40 and the Borovansky Jubilee Ballet. Borovansky had also encouraged the formation of the Melbourne Ballet Club, which displayed and encouraged new choreography.
From 1940 his company presented studio performances for the Melbourne Ballet Club of original choreography by himself, Xenia Borovansky, Laurel Martyn and Dorothy Stevenson. Works choreographed and presented during this period include Martyn's "Sigrid", Stevenson's "Sea Legend" (whose setting was designed by William Constable) and Martyn's "En Saga". In 1942, Borovansky's company presented a five-night season at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne. The season was such a success that it convinced J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd that ballet "was potentially big business". Borovansky now had commercial backing and access to theatres across Australia. In return, his company was formed to provide commercial success. The backing of J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd was a turning-point, for without it the company would have died, similarly to the Sydney-based Kirsova Ballet (1941–44), which had refused commercial backing and collapsed despite an Australia-wide following. The company therefore performed "large, colourful, familiar works which were what 'the Firm' preferred".
Borovansky was naturalised as a British subject in 1944, becoming a well-known figure in Melbourne and "notorious for his despotic treatment of his dancers". In 1944, the 40-strong company had toured the mainland capitals, Tasmania and New Zealand with a repertoire that included "Giselle", "Swan Lake" (Act II), "Les Sylphides", "En Saga", "Capriccio Italien", Frederick Ashton's "Façade", and Borovansky's symphonic fantasy, "Vltava". In 1945, the company toured mainland Australia again. This tour included an 8-month season in Melbourne featuring the "tried favourites of pre-war 'Russian ballet'" - "Le Carnaval", "Schéhérazade" and "Le Beau Danube" - as well as a new work by Borovansky, "Terra Australis".
At the end of this season Laurel Martyn left the company to form, out of the original Melbourne Ballet Club, the Victorian Ballet Guild. Her choice of a small, experimental dance company over the glamorous professional stage highlighted the dilemma Borovansky faced. Borovansky had built a "strong, commercially attractive operation on the basis of the school run by his wife and a keen sense of what the public would pay to see". However, as his company was funded by J. C. Williamson's, they dictated what the company could do. Borovansky's company had expanded and now included such dancers as Paul Hammond, Martin Rubinstein, Leon Kellaway, Peggy Sager, Kathleen Gorham, Vassilie Trunoff and Edna Busse. For the next 18 months, the company (now called the Borovansky Ballet) became the dance-chorus for two operettas and toured New Zealand a second time while also holding seasons of "Coppélia" and other favourites. The company was disbanded in 1948 due to lack of financial backing.
In 1951, Borovansky assembled a second company called the Borovansky Jubilee Ballet which was sponsored by the Education in Music and Dramatic Arts Society as well as J. C. Williamson's. He presented ambitious productions with the company such as a full-sized "Petrouchka" that year. While in 1952, he produced a complete "Sleeping Princess". Seasons included Léonide Massine's "Symphonie Fantastique" (1954), John Cranko's "Pineapple Poll" (1954) and David Lichine's full-length "The Nutcracker" (1955). During its 1957 season, it hosted guest artists from the Royal Ballet including Margot Fonteyn. Borovansky choreographed a number of works for his company. Some, like "The Black Swan", "Terra Australis" and "The Outlaw", were overtly Australian in theme. Later, choreographers who worked for him included company members Paul Grinwis and Robert Pomié. He also commissioned David Lichine to create an original ballet which premiered on 17 February 1956 as "Corrida".
Works.
Borovansky choreographed several works for his company. His first work, "Vltava", premiered at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, on 9 December 1940 as part of the first season of the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company. "Vltava" was "patriotically Czech in music, theme and imagery" as it drew on his European heritage for inspiration. Borovansky choreographed this work to the symphonic poem "Má vlast" by Czech composer Bedřich Smetana. The Vltava is the longest river in the Czech Republic and thus the main role was named the Spirit of the River and was originally danced by Laurel Martyn. The main male roles of the Hunters were taken by Noel Neville, George Hale, Reg Bartram and Laurie Rentoul. In the original performances the music was played on two pianos by Marjorie Summers and Edna Bennet. According to the programme of the performance, Borovansky "endeavoured to express the spirit of the young Czechoslovakia". The cast wore white shorts and shirts for their costumes, which suggested that Borovansky was making a political statement on the nationalistic youth movements of Czechoslovakia with which he was familiar. The choreography was reminiscent of Léonide Massine's "Choreartium". This work remained in the repertoire of the company until at least 1945 when it was taken on tour to New Zealand.
Borovansky's second ballet was "Terra Australis", which is the first all-Australian ballet. It premiered in Melbourne on 25 May 1946, performed by his company. The ballet's libretto was by Tom Rothfield while the score was commissioned from Esther Rofe. The ballet focused on the subject of Australia's colonisation by white settlers. This was represented in the form of a love triangle where the virginal Spirit of Australia was courted by a white explorer and an Aboriginal lover. The original cast featured Peggy Sager as the Spirit of Australia, Martin Rubinstein as the Explorer and Vassilie Trunoff as the Aborigine. The ballet was restaged in 1947 with Kathleen Gorham as the new lead.
Borovansky's next ballet, "The Black Swan", also had an Australian theme. It was based on a historical incident in 1697 when Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company was exploring Australia. He discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now stands. There were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. Thus, the main plot of the ballet was the story of the Captain entranced by a black swan, which symbolised a new land. The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951.
Death and legacy.
Borovansky died of a coronary occlusion on 18 December 1959 at Randwick, and was buried with Anglican rites in Box Hill Cemetery, Melbourne. He was survived by his wife; they had no children. His company provided the basis for the creation of a national Australian company. The artistic director of the Borovansky Ballet, Peggy van Praagh, founded the Australian Ballet in 1962. His dancers also provided the nucleus of the national ballet company - including such dancers as Garth Welch, Robert Pomie, Jeffrey Kovel, Estella Nova and Rosemary Mildner. During his last season of "Sleeping Princess", Marilyn Jones was hailed overnight as a ballerina. The Borovansky Ballet company was "both an intensely personal creation, where one man did almost everything, and a national ballet, eager to draw on whatever talent it could employ". On 21 March 1980 a gala tribute celebrating Borovansky's work as the founder of ballet in Australia was held at the Sydney Opera House. The programme consisted of "Pineapple Poll", "Schéhérazade" and "Graduation Ball". He was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Australian Dance Awards in 1999.

Personal life and career.
Stony was born in Iceland. His father, Baldvin, is an Icelandic baker and his mother, Deborah, a Spanish modeling agent. Stony graduated from Reykjavík College of Music with a degree in jazz drumming and music theory, as well as studying dramatic acting at Reykjavík School of the Arts. He previously attended Akureyri Junior College. While in school, Stony worked as a vendor at a hot-dog stand in downtown Akureyri, and because Akureyri is only home to about 20,000 people, he had a lot of free time at work. He used this time to write songs and raps. Growing up he wanted to become a rapper, and needed a rap name that would stick in people's heads. He went with Stony, which is a rough translation of the second part of his Icelandic name, Thorsteinn, "rock".
Stony began drumming at an early age, starting with pots and pans at the age of 6 and receiving his first drum set as a Christmas present from his father. He then used his father's video camera to record videos of him and his friend playing music, which escalated to him uploading those videos to YouTube, under the channel name Stony's World. These videos caught the attention of "Collegehumor", for whom he remixes videos under the name SteffComedy. He has uploaded drum covers of, for example, Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend". His most popular video by far is a loop cover he did of Macklemore's "Can't Hold Us", with more than 862,000 views .

10 cm Nebelwerfer 35

The 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35 (10 cm NbW 35) was a heavy mortar used by Germany during World War II. Much like the American M2 4.2 inch mortar it was intended to deliver chemical munitions, such as gas and smoke shells. Unlike the American weapon it appears to have had an ordinary high-explosive shell from the beginning. It was of conventional design, and was virtually a scaled-up 8 cm GrW 34. It broke down into the standard three loads for transport. The tube weighed , the baseplate and the bipod . Each could be man-packed for some distance, but small handcarts were issued for longer distances. Each mortar squad consisted of a squad leader, three gunners and three ammunition bearers. 
It was initially deployed in ( "smoke or fog-thrower") battalions belonging to the Chemical Corps of the Heer; exactly how the American initially fielded their own 4.2 inch mortar in chemical mortar battalions. From 1941 they were replaced by the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 40 and the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 multiple rocket launcher.
Operational Use.
Initially they were deployed in "Nebelwerfer" battalions numbered 1 to 9, plus the "Nebel-Lehr Abteilung (Demonstration Battalion)" and saw service in the Battle of France and Russia during Operation Barbarossa. 
Specialist units using these Mortars were also formed, such as "Gebirgs-Werfer-Abteilung (Mountain Mortar Battalion) 10" which was formed in Finland in early 1942 by expanding "Nebelwerfer-Batterie 222"., This had itself been converted from "8th Battery" of "Artillery Regiment 222" of the "181st Infantry Division" during the invasion of Norway.
Following their replacement in the chemical corps, further uses were found for the Mortars, including issue to Fallschirmjager units as Heavy Mortars.

Travel CUTS

Travel CUTS (French: Voyages Campus) is a Canadian travel agency catering to student, youth, educational, and budget travellers. Under its original ownership, Travel CUTS was operated as a hybrid commercial enterprise and non-profit organization. Travel CUTS is currently owned and operated by Merit Travel Group.
Operations.
Travel CUTS was founded with the purpose of providing discounted travel and International Student Identity Cards to students; however, it has since expanded to serve the general public as well. Travel CUTS operates 19 locations in Canada, often on or near university and college campuses ("CUTS" was originally an acronym for "Canadian University Travel Service"). In the province of Quebec, the company operates as Voyages Campus. Travel CUTS also owns and operates several specialty divisions, catering to different categories of travellers:
History.
Travel CUTS had its origins in the 1950s with travel services offered by the now-defunct Canadian Union of Students ("CUS") through an unincorporated operation. After the CUS dissolved in 1969, a group of Ontario university student councils formed the Association of Ontario Student Councils, which took over the operation of the student travel service. In the next few years, the Association of Ontario Student Councils expanded across Canada and came to be called the Association of Students' Councils ("AOSC").
As a result of legislation passed by the Canadian government requiring airline tickets to be sold through travel agents, in 1974 the AOSC incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, "Canadian University Travel Services Limited" ("CUTS").
In 1979, CUTS established its "Student Work Abroad Program" ("SWAP"), which is still in operation. SWAP assists students to obtain the necessary documentation to travel and work in foreign countries.
In 1981, the Canadian Federation of Students ("CFS") was founded and replaced a large number of provincial and national student organizations. After its creation, CFS incorporated a separate division, CFS-Services, which took over operation of the services previously operated by the AOSC, including CUTS. At that time, CUTS adopted the trade-name "Travel CUTS".
In 1996, the University of Western Ontario University Students' Council initiated a lawsuit against CFS-Services, alleging that it illegally transferred assets from the AOSC to itself at a 1987 meeting. The student societies of three other universities (Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia, Queen's Alma Mater Society and University of Alberta Students' Union) later joined the suit as co-plaintiffs. The parties settled the action out of court, resulting in the plaintiffs acquiring a minority interest of the shares of Travel CUTS and two seats on its board of directors. As a result, the CFS held 76% of the shares and the Canadian Student Horizons Group (the plaintiff student groups) held 24%.
Travel CUTS went into receivership on October 23, 2009 and several offices in Canada closed. On October 26, 2009, Merit Travel Group, a privately held Canadian travel company, purchased Travel CUTS.

Cuitlatec language

Cuitlatec, or Cuitlateco, is an extinct language of Mexico, formerly spoken by an indigenous people also known as Cuitlatec.
Classification.
Cuitlatec has not been convincingly classified as belonging to any language family. It is believed to be language isolate. In their controversial classification of the indigenous languages of the Americas, Greenberg and Ruhlen include Cuitlatec in an expanded Chibchan language family, along with a variety of other Mesoamerican and South American languages. Hernández suggests a possible relation to the Uto-Aztecan languages.
Geographic distribution.
Cuitlatec was spoken in the state of Guerrero. By the 1930s, Cuitlatec was spoken only in San Miguel Totolapan. The last speaker of the language, Juana Can, is believed to have died in the 1960s.
Grammar.
Sentences generally follow SVO word order. Adjectives precede the nouns they modify.

Iljimae (, literally "One blossom branch", also known as "Il-Ji-Mae: The Phantom Thief") is a 2008 South Korean historical action television drama series, starring Lee Joon-gi in the title role of Iljimae, Han Hyo-joo, Lee Young-ah and Park Si-hoo. It is loosely based on a comic strip "Iljimae", published between 1975 and 1977, by Ko Woo-yung that was based on a Chinese folklore from the Ming dynasty about a masked Robin Hood-esque character during the Joseon era.
It was directed by Lee Yong-suk and produced by Chorokbaem Media. It aired on Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) from May 21 to July 24, 2008 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes.
Background.
There have been several versions of this story, which first appeared in two Ming dynasty novels, including a 1994 Hong Kong film, a 2005 TVB series and a 2011 Chinese television series, called "The Vigilantes In Masks".
MBC bought the rights to the comic strip for their adaptation, hence the SBS version features an original storyline. Lee is the second Korean actor to play the hero following Jang Dong-gun in 1993 and followed by Jung Il-woo for MBC's "The Return of Iljimae" in 2009.
Synopsis.
Lee Gyeom (Lee Joon-gi) is the son of a virtuous nobleman Lee Won-ho, a trustworthy supporter and brother to the king and a central member of the secret organization Cheonwoohoe, composed of important nobles and with the king as their leader. He lives peacefully in a house with many plum trees with his wife, daughter, and son. However, the king has a conversation with a blind fortunes teller. Looking at Lee Won-ho's home, the blind man states that he sees a person who is as bright as the sun, and will be adored by the people. The king kills Lee Won-ho as he believes that 'two suns cannot exist on the same sky'. Gyeom witnesses the incident from the inside of a safe where his father hid him. Later, he is saved and adopted by a retired thief, Swe Dol, after he becomes stricken with amnesia due to the shock of losing his father and being forced to throw a rock at his mother's head to prove that he was not the son. 13 years later, Gyeom, now called Yong, starts to regain his memories and begins to search for his older sister, Yeon, only to see her being sentenced and hanged.
The murder of his older sister leaves Gyeom seeking revenge. With the emblem on the killer's sword he remembers from 13 years ago his only clue, he swears that he will find the one who killed his father and murdered his older sister. To find the sword and its owner, he disguises himself as Iljimae and breaks into the nobles' estates.is a mysterious, black-swathed thief who robs corrupt government officials and gives to the poor. He steals not only material treasures but also people, be they wrongfully held prisoners or criminals hiding from judgment. At the scene of each robbery, he leaves a small painting of a branch of red plum blossoms called a "mae hwa". (His name reflects this act: il means "one", ji means "branch" and mae means "plum tree".) The citizens support Iljimae while the king and the nobility try to catch him and find his identity. During the course of his actions, he winds up fighting not only for himself, but also for the people; and so he becomes a fighter for the common people, jumping into action whenever the people are oppressed and wrongly exploited for the sake of the nobles, thus becoming adored by the people and one villager goes far enough to state "He is our sun!". At the core of his motives though, he still desires to find the person who destroyed his family, and bring justice to them.

<doc id="18229050" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18229050" title="La saga de los Aznar">
La saga de los Aznar

La saga de los Aznar is a work of 32 science fiction novels by Spanish writer Pascual Enguídanos. They were published in Spain between 1953 and 1958 (first part) and 1973 and 1978 (second part) in the "Luchadores del Espacio" collection by Editorial Valenciana and they appeared under the pseudonym George H. White. It was awarded "Best European Science Fiction Series" at the Eurocon in Brussels in 1978.
The work represents a Spanish equivalent of science fiction and space opera that populated North American pulp fiction in the nineteen thirties and forties, a trend in which were forged such great authors as E.E. Doc Smith, Jack Williamson and Edmond Hamilton. The series has an adventurous nature and nostalgia for a bygone era. It contains a distinctly epic war and all kinds of adventures, while collecting a certain respect for science and technology which are not as battered as other works of that time. 
Likely having copied the term "orbimotor" from Jose Elola, a.k.a. Colonel Ignotus, it non-the-less contains the aesthetics of Alex Raymond's, Flash Gordon: the prose is very visual. Enguídanos had a special interest in Mongo-styled planets, with its mix of future and archaic, feudal regimes, princes and lords despotic, primitive peoples oppressed, and, of course, men of silicon, insect men, floor men, or fish men.
Enguídanos' early works reflected classical space-opera, but very soon the Saga of Aznar was leading towards a unique epic among the stars, with a trace of classical myths. If Aeneas escaped from destroyed Troy to cross a sea unknown and found a distant colony which would be the birthplace of an empire, Rome and the first Aznar lead the survivors of the invasion of Earth by an alien species to a distant star to rebuild the lost homeland, Inci thereby in the collective ownership of the people valerano (Valera, an original 'autoplaneta') were heirs of mankind.
Enguídanos' series is likely of a number unparalleled in all of science fiction. In Saga, futuristic technology meets a very specific logic and originality: 'metal hyperdensity that repels the gravity low electric induction', ships that simulate cetacean space forms, the sidereal armed with millions of ships in battle over the fate of mankind, Z-rays, "sunlight" as a lethal weapon or as interstellar propellant, and the fabulous machines Karendon (inclusive of the field as the famous Star Trek transporters but brought here to their logical conclusion).
Beyond the adventures of war and futurism, Saga is also a very comprehensive utopian science fiction. A future society where the players have all the elements that characterize it as utopian, where money has been eliminated and automation has freed the human race from work. But in utopias of science fiction things are not so placid and well run; the island of Utopia (the Earth's future or any of its stellar colonies, including such wandering colony which is the fabulous autoplaneta Valera) is subjected to terrible dangers and frightening threats.
Saga stresses a realistic treatment of the characters: Unlike other series, the protagonists of the Saga not only live their lives in fullness of adventure and excitement, but also are born and die as in real life. The novels allow the reader to accompany the vicissitudes of mankind through family members of the first protagonist (the aviator Miguel Angel Aznar de Soto), who is thrown from the contemporary period, after an adventure in search of 'flying saucers' in the Himalayas, to an unlikely but highly suggestive Venus' Jurassic, and finally to five centuries in the future with the Earth on the brink of a dreadful World War and the shadow of an even more horrific alien invasion looming.
Step by step, without giving rest to the suffering humanity, Enguídanos describes the vicissitudes of future exiles from the land, citizens of the Federation Ibero, who manage to escape the invasion of the "abominable gray beast, thorbod". 
Pascual Enguídanos not only achieved a long series of novels, but managed to keep a cycle of tension and growing interest, by constantly evolving the plot and characters. Enguídanos, with ups and downs in the 'normal' range, managed to maintain and even improve the quality as the Saga progressed.

Spearfish Canyon

Spearfish Canyon is a deep but narrow gorge carved by Spearfish Creek just south of Spearfish, South Dakota in the U.S. It is located on the northern edge of Black Hills National Forest. Many tourists drive through the canyon, drawn to the region due to its wide range of plant and wildlife, geology, rock formations, and waterfalls. Spearfish Creek holds populations of rainbow and brown trout and is dammed in several spots, affording fishing opportunities. Stocking of trout in Spearfish Creek was discontinued in the 1970s and all trout in the creek today are wild. In addition, remnants of Spearfish Canyon's active mining history are still easily found in some locations.
History.
Six hundred million or so years ago, long before man walked this area, it was covered by a huge sea. As waters subsided and land masses began to appear 30 to 60 million years ago, drainages such as Spearfish Canyon formed as softer rock was eroded away. Today, a National Scenic Byway, U.S. Highway 14A, winds through the canyon. This area is truly a crossroads, and trees and plants from Rocky Mountains, eastern woodlands, northern forests, and the Great Plains areas can be found here. 
Flora and Fauna.
Of the 1,585 plant species found in South Dakota, 1,260 species are in the Black Hills, many of which can be found in Spearfish Canyon. Ponderosa Pines are the most prominent vegetation in the Black Hills, rivaling the evergreens of the Northwest. As for bird species, Turkeys, Bluejays, Woodpeckers, Cliff Swallows, Chickadees, and Golden or Bald Eagles. The canyon supports a cross-section of four-footed animal life. White-tail and Mule deer can be found throughout the drive. Porcupines, Raccoons, Squirrels, and Chipmunks might be spotted as well as a Bobcat or a Yellow-Bellied Marmot.
Geology.
It is often studied by geologists due to the extreme old age of the Precambrian rocks exposed by the Creek bed. The Canyon's high walls are of three dominant rock types. Deadwood shale at the bottom can be identified by its brown color, is multi-layered in appearance and ranges from 10 to 400 feet thick. Englewood limestone in the middle is pink to red colored and is 30 to 60 feet thick. Paha sapa limestone, the top layer, is the thickest (300 to 600 feet) and is buff colored and weathered gray in appearance. Caves and fossils are frequently found in Paha sapa limestone.

The village does not have running water or electricity, and all economic activity is reduced to subsistence farming and a few primitive taverns which serve warm beer. Some people got jobs at Youga Gold Mine and this newfound prosperity is reflected in a number of makeshift shops springing up by the sides of dusty roads. Burkina Mining Company, the owners of Youga Gold Mine, have built a school and clinic in the village, and Youga Power Project, designed and managed by South African company AMPCOR, is in its final stages of linking the Youga Gold Mine and Youga village to Ghanaian VRA electricity power grid.

Workingmen's Party of New York

"For other organizations with a similar name, see Workingmen's Party (disambiguation)." 
The Workingmens' Party or Working Men's Party was founded in 1829 in New York City, inspired by the political views of editor of New York City's "Free Enquirer" Robert Dale Owen.
Background.
In the late 1820s, corruption was rampant in the municipal administration of New York City. Public services like street lighting, were rendered by friends of the politicians who got monopolies for almost no payment to the city. "Charter dealers", among them Samuel B. Romaine, bribed assemblymen in Albany to get a large number of banks chartered. These banks issued their own currency with which working men were paid but which was not well accepted by the commerce, and devaluated quickly. Contractors built houses, but did not pay the workers after delivering the house, without consequences.
Convention.
The party held a convention at Military Hall in New York City on October 19, 1829, and adopted resolutions against private and exclusive possession of the soil and hereditary transmission of wealth, against exclusive privileges, monopolies and exemptions. They denounced bankers as "the greatest knaves, impostors and paupers of the age." The party nominated a full ticket for the state and city elections in November.
Elections.
Ebenezer Ford, the President of the Journeymen Carpenters Society, was elected to the New York State Assembly on the Workingmen ticket. Besides, the splitting of the votes among the several parties led to the election of many candidates opposed to Tammany Hall, mainly National Republicans. At the municipal election the Workingmen received about 6,000 votes, Tammany Hall about 11,000. The result was the failure of Tammany to secure a majority in the Common Council. Mayor Walter Bowne (Grand Sachem of the Tammany Society in 1820 and 1831) stood for re-election. Fourteen Aldermen and Assistants were opposed to Bowne, and thirteen favored him. Bowne, who was not a member but as Mayor presided over the Council, said that the constitution permitted him to vote for the office of Mayor which led seven Alderman to walk out, leaving the Council without quorum on December 29, 1829. They returned on January 6, 1830, and Bowne was elected by a majority of one vote. How this vote was obtained was a mystery. Fourteen members declared under oath that they had voted for Thomas R. Smith, Bowne’s opponent.
Achievements.
Threatened by the new party’s strength, Tammany fought back by adopting partly the reform measures demanded by the Workingmen. In January 1830, a bill for the better security of mechanics and other laborers of New York City was introduced in the State Assembly by Silas M. Stilwell. The Tammany men immediately took it up as if it were their own, voted for it, and secured the credit of its adoption, when it became a law. Among other things, it required, under penalties, the owner of a building to retain from the contractor the amount to be paid to the workers.
Decline.
On April 16, 1830, the Workingmen's Party held a state convention at Albany and nominated Erastus Root for Governor. Root declined the nomination, and the Party later nominated Ezekiel Williams from Cayuga County to run. He polled only 2332 votes.
Due to the adoption of some of the reforms by Tammany, and the beginning of political struggles inside the party, the movement broke up. At the municipal election in 1830 there appeared three separate tickets each of which purported to be the regular representation of the Party: the "Clay Workingmen" (with partisans of Henry Clay, and big stock-holders among the candidates, polling about 7,000 votes), the rump "Workingmen's Party" led by Robert D. Owen (polling about 2,200), and the "Agrarian Party" (polling 116 votes). With the majority absorbed into mainstream politics, and no radicals elected, the party ceased to exist.

Doushantuo type preservation

The preservational mode of the Doushantuo formation involves very early phosphatisation on a cellular level - with cells being replaced by phosphate before they degrade.
Occurrence.
The mode of preservation is typically found in shallow, high energy waters, as lenses of phosphate in carbonate rocks. Its occurrence is assisted by high concentrations of phosphate, which are presumably led to precipitate around the degradation products of cells and cell walls.
What is preserved.
Cells are preserved at a cellular level, with arguments that sub-cellular structures may even represent cell nuclei.
Bias.
Although the preservational window is open pretty continually from about through most of the Cambrian, it tends to preserve microscopic things, such as embryos and bacteria.

Mark Angelo

Mark Angelo, hails from Burnaby, British Columbia and is an internationally celebrated river conservationist, writer, speaker, teacher and paddler. He is the founder and chair of both BC Rivers Day and World Rivers Day, an event now embraced by millions of people in more than 60 countries. In 2009, Mark was appointed as the inaugural chair of the Rivers Institute at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). Prior to that, he was the long-time head of the Fish, Wildlife and Recreation Program at BCIT.
Mark has received the Order of British Columbia and the Order of Canada (his country's highest honour) in recognition of his river conservation efforts over the past four decades. Among his many other awards are the inaugural United Nations Stewardship Award and the National River Conservation Award. In 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University for his river conservation work both locally and globally.
Upon graduating from the University of Montana, Mark moved to Vancouver, BC as a young man. Over the next several decades, Mark played a leadership role in numerous river conservation and restoration initiatives. Such projects, which number in the hundreds, have ranged from successful efforts to restore heavily damaged urban streams, such as Guichon Creek in Burnaby and Still Creek in Vancouver - to effective campaigns that helped clean up severely polluted streams, such as Britannia Creek(a once toxic site that, in 2011, saw salmon return for the first time in a century) - to broad-based initiatives to protect the "Heart of the Fraser", one of the most productive stretches of river anywhere in the world. He also played a leading role in the successful multi-year campaign to daylight and reclaim Hastings Creek in Vancouver. This urban stream had been literally buried and paved over almost a century ago and it’s restoration (stage one was completed in September, 2013) is one of the most progressive projects of its kind. In addition, Mark has worked on and profiled numerous international river issues. His efforts have been honored by an array of governments, community groups, professional bodies and indigenous communities, both in Canada and abroad.
As an avid kayaker, canoeist and rafter, Mark has traveled on or along close to a thousand rivers spanning well over one hundred countries; perhaps more than any other individual. From 2003 to 2007, his acclaimed program, "Riverworld; a personal journey to the world's wildest rivers", launched in conjunction with National Geographic on-line, played to sold-out audiences across North America and the program's website had more than 40 million visits. In 2007, his follow-up program, Wild Water, Wild Earth, a sequel to Riverworld, enjoyed similar success. Mark continues to work on conservation issues, both across Canada and elsewhere in the world. He has written over 300 articles and essays about his experiences and related conservation issues for an array of publications and is a regular contributor to the Vancouver Sun and other newspapers.
Mark served as a past Chair and inaugural member of the Pacific Fisheries Resource Conservation Council. In addition, Mark also served as the first non-government provincial representative and Chair of the Canadian Heritage Rivers Board. He was also the inaugural Chair of the BC Heritage River System from 1997 to 2001, the first provincial initiative of its kind. From 1998 to 2000, Mark was appointed by the Province to chair the BC Park Legacy Panel, a public consultation exercise that engaged almost one hundred thousand British Columbians. Among many key findings, the panel outlined the need to strengthen BC Park's commitment to ecological integrity while also advocating the need for increased funding for a park system that had recently doubled in size. As long time Rivers Chair for the Outdoor Recreation Council of BC, Mark also coordinated the compilation of BC's annual "most endangered rivers" list from its inception in 1993 to 2011. The compilation of this list is one of the most in depth initiatives of its kind and has provided much needed profile for river issues around the province.
In September, 1980, Mark organized a major cleanup of the Thompson River in the southern interior of British Columbia. In the months leading up to this event, he approached the Province and local governments about proclaiming the last Sunday in September as BC Rivers Day, an event intended to celebrate the many values of our rivers. After a very successful inaugural event, Mark, in conjunction with the Outdoor Recreation Council, helped organize additional festivities in the years that followed. Eventually, BC Rivers Day grew to become the biggest event of its kind in North America involving up to 75,000 people in activities ranging from stream clean-ups and fish enhancement activities to educational outings and community riverside celebrations. In 2004, following the International Year of Fresh Water, Mark approached various agencies of the United Nations about establishing World Rivers Day based on the BC model. The response was enthusiastically positive and the establishment of World Rivers Day was seen to be very complimentary to the UN Water for Life Decade initiative launched in 2005. Under Mark's leadership, a massive grassroots effort was undertaken to encourage the participation of international river-related groups and by 2011, on the final Sunday in September, literally thousands of World Rivers Day events were celebrated by millions people in more than 60 countries (See recent television story).
In 2011, Mark coordinated a major Water for Life benefit concert in Burnaby, BC which was also filmed by Global TV to air in June as a major television special. The event focused on the importance of all waterways and the need to be good water stewards wherever we might live. The genesis of this event stemmed from Mark's experiences in Ethiopia's Omo River Valley in 2010. All proceeds from the Water for Life concert benefitted international water relief efforts. The Water for Life TV program was also widely acclaimed and very successful, handily winning the ratings in its time slot.
Mark is a Fellow International member of the New York based Explorers Club as well as a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographic Society. On October 27, 2011, Mark was awarded a special lifetime achievement award by the BCIT Alumni and Foundation at a gala Vancouver dinner. On November 3, 2011, Mark was also presented with the prestigious 'Land Champion Award' by the Real Estate Foundation of BC in recognition of his decades-long advocacy for the wise stewardship of land and water resources. In late November 2011, Mark announced his retirement from full-time work and was honored with the title, Chair Emeritus of the Rivers Institute.
On April 30, 2012, MLA Kathy Corrigan rose in the British Columbia Legislature to make a very special tribute (link to video of speech) on behalf of the Province honouring Mark upon his retirement.
Mark continues to support and mentor both fledgling and established river conservation groups, as well as young people with an interest in river conservation. He is also currently working on a major global river documentary film set for international release in mid 2014. Entitled River Blue, this ambitious and much anticipated film chronicles some of Mark’s extensive international river travels while providing an overview of the global state of our waterways. The film also includes one of the first extensive looks at the impact of the textile industry on rivers.
Mark is a Canadian and lives in Burnaby, British Columbia, with his wife, Kathie. They have 2 adult daughters, Kelly and Lindsay. In August 2011, Mark and Kathy also celebrated the arrival of their first grandson.
Mark is the son of distinguished Australian born actress Shirley Ann Richards, and Edmund Angelo.

Beecher's Trilobite Bed

Beecher's Trilobite Bed is a Konservat-Lagerstätte of Late Ordovician (Caradoc) age located within the Frankfort Shale in Cleveland's Glen, Oneida County, New York, USA. Only 3-4 centimeters thick, Beecher's Trilobite Bed has yielded numerous exceptionally preserved trilobites with the ventral anatomy and soft tissue intact, the soft tissue preserved by pyrite replacement. Pyritisation allows the use of X-rays to study fine detail of preserved soft body parts still within the host rock. Pyrite replacement of soft tissue is unusual in the fossil
record; the only Lagerstätten thought to show such
preservation were Beecher's Trilobite Bed, the Devonian Hunsrück Slates of Germany, and the Jurassic beds of La Voulte-sur-Rhône in France, although new locations are coming to light in New York state.
History of research.
Originally discovered in 1892 by William S. Valiant, the site was thoroughly excavated from 1893 to 1895 by Charles Emerson Beecher (after whom the location is named) of Yale University, after which time the location was thought to be exhausted of fossils and excavations ceased.
Beecher published three papers describing a trilobite larval form,
trilobite limbs
and trilobite ventral anatomy from material collected from the site he established. Beecher died unexpectedly in 1904; much material, as well as details of the location, was lost. Research was subsequently limited to study of material collected during the original excavations that had been distributed to various institutions.
Amateur fossil collectors Tom E. Whiteley (also responsible for rediscovering the Walcott-Rust quarry) and Dan Cooper rediscovered the location in 1984 and from 1985 academic excavations and studies (re)-commenced. At least 4 other fossil bearing horizons exhibiting similar preservation have subsequently been found at the original site. The small quarry at the site is currently closed to public access, being on private land and administered by Yale Peabody Museum as part of ongoing research projects.
Sedimentology, environment of deposition & preservation.
The original Beecher's Trilobite Bed is found within a thick succession of fine grained turbidite beds, the fossiliferous bed is about 40 mm thick laying on a scoured mudstone surface with remnants of burrows. Well preserved fossil remains are found 7–10 mm above the base parallel to the bedding plane, strongly aligned by the current, with as many facing up as down. Chemically, the bed contains high iron coupled with low organic carbon and low organic sulphur.
Fauna.
The trilobite "Triarthrus eatoni" comprises 85% of the organisms sampled at the locality, other taxa include graptolites, branching algae, brachiopods and problematica. The trilobites "Cryptolithus bellulus" (Ulrich), "Cornuproetus beecheri" (Ruedeman), "Primaspis crosotus" (Locke) are also recorded.

Microbial mat

A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of microorganisms, mainly bacteria and archaea. Microbial mats grow at interfaces between different types of material, mostly on submerged or moist surfaces, but a few survive in deserts. They colonize environments ranging in temperature from –40°C to 120°C. A few are found as endosymbionts of animals.
Although only a few centimetres thick at most, microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant chemicals at their level and which are usually of closely related species. In moist conditions mats are usually held together by slimy substances secreted by the micro-organisms, and in many cases some of the micro-organisms form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher. The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites, but there are also spherical forms.
Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good fossil evidence, from , and have been the most important members and maintainers of the planet's ecosystems. Originally they depended on hydrothermal vents for energy and chemical "food", but the development of photosynthesis gradually liberated them from the "hydrothermal ghetto" by providing a more widely available energy source, sunlight, although initially the photosynthesizing mats still depended on the diffusion of chemicals emitted by hydrothermal vents. The final and most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen-producing photosynthesis, since the main chemical inputs for this are carbon dioxide and water.
As a result microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free oxygen is a vital component. At around the same time they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, of which all multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant micro-organisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of the deep oceans. 
Because of microbial mats' ability to use almost anything as "food", there is considerable interest in industrial uses of mats, especially for water treatment and for cleaning up pollution.

Microbial mats have also been referred to as "algal mats" and "bacterial mats" in older scientific literature. They are a type of biofilm that is large enough to see with the naked eye and robust enough to survive moderate physical stresses. These colonies of bacteria form on surfaces at many types of interface, for example between water and the sediment or rock at the bottom, between air and rock or sediment, between soil and bed-rock, etc. Such interfaces form vertical chemical gradients, i.e. vertical variations in chemical composition, which make different levels suitable for different types of bacteria and thus divide microbial mats into layers, which may be sharply defined or may merge more gradually into each other. A variety of microbes are able to transcend the limits of diffusion by using "nanowires" to shuttle electrons from their metabolic reactions up to two centimetres deep in the sediment - for example, electrons can be transferred from reactions involving hydrogen sulfide deeper within the sediment to oxygen in the water, which acts as an electron acceptor.
The best-known types of microbial mat may be flat laminated mats, which form on approximately horizontal surfaces, and stromatolites, stubby pillars built as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment deposited on them by water. However there are also spherical mats, some on the outside of pellets of rock or other firm material and others "inside" spheres of sediment.
Structure.
A microbial mat consists of several layers, each of which is dominated by specific types of micro-organism, mainly bacteria. Although the composition of individual mats varies depending on the environment, as a general rule the by-products of each group of micro-organisms serve as "food" for other groups. In effect each mat forms its own food chain, with one or a few groups at the top of the food chain as their by-products are not consumed by other groups. Different types of micro-organism dominate different layers based on their comparative advantage for living in that layer. In other words they live in positions where they can out-perform other groups rather than where they would absolutely be most comfortable — ecological relationships between different groups are a combination of competition and co-operation. Since the metabolic capabilities of bacteria (what they can "eat" and what conditions they can tolerate) generally depend on their phylogeny (i.e. the most closely related groups have the most similar metabolisms), the different layers of a mat are divided both by their different metabolic contributions to the community and by their phylogenetic relationships.
In a wet environment where sunlight is the main source of energy, the uppermost layers are generally dominated by aerobic photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (blue-green bacteria whose color is caused by their having chlorophyll), while the lowest layers are generally dominated by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria. Sometimes there are intermediate (oxygenated only in the daytime) layers inhabited by facultative anaerobic bacteria. For example, in hypersaline ponds near Guerrero Negro (Mexico) various kind of mats were explored. There are some mats with a middle purple layer inhabited by photosynthesizing purple bacteria. Some other mats have a white layer inhabited by chemotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and beneath them an olive layer inhabited by photosynthesizing green sulfur bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. However, this layer structure is not changeless during a day: some species of cyanobacteria migrate to deeper layers at morning, and go back at evening, to avoid intensive solar light and UV radiation at mid-day.
Microbial mats are generally held together and bound to their substrates by slimy extracellular polymeric substances which they secrete. In many cases some of the bacteria form filaments (threads), which tangle and thus increase the colonies' structural strength, especially if the filaments have sheaths (tough outer coverings). 
This combination of slime and tangled threads attracts other micro-organisms which become part of the mat community, for example protozoa, some of which feed on the mat-forming bacteria, and diatoms, which often seal the surfaces of submerged microbial mats with thin, parchment-like coverings.
Marine mats may grow to a few centimeters in thickness, of which only the top few millimeters are oxygenated.
Types of environment colonized.
Underwater microbial mats have been described as layers that live by exploiting and to some extent modifying local chemical gradients, i.e. variations in the chemical composition. Thinner, less complex biofilms live in many sub-aerial environments, for example on rocks, on mineral particles such as sand, and within soil. They have to survive for long periods without liquid water, often in a dormant state. Microbial mats that live in tidal zones, such as those found in the Sippewissett salt marsh, often contain a large proportion of similar micro-organisms that can survive for several hours without water.
Microbial mats and less complex types of biofilm are found at temperature ranges from –40°C to +120°C, because variations in pressure affect the temperatures at which water remains liquid.
They even appear as endosymbionts in some animals, for example in the hindguts of some echinoids.
Ecological and geological importance.
[[File:Runzelmarken.jpg|thumb|250px|This wrinkled Kinneyia-type sedimentary structures formed beneath cohesive microbial mats in peritidal zones. The image shows the location, in the Burgsvik beds of Sweden, where the texture was first identified as evidence of a microbial mat.]]
Microbial mats use all of the types of metabolism and feeding strategy that have evolved on Earth — anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis; anaerobic and aerobic chemotrophy (using chemicals rather than sunshine as a source of energy); organic and inorganic respiration and fermentation (i..e converting food into energy with and without using oxygen in the process); autotrophy (producing food from inorganic compounds) and heterotrophy (producing food only from organic compounds, by some combination of predation and detritivory).
Most sedimentary rocks and ore deposits have grown by a reef-like build-up rather than by "falling" out of the water, and this build-up has been at least influenced and perhaps sometimes caused by the actions of microbes. Stromatolites, bioherms (domes or columns similar internally to stromatolites) and biostromes (distinct sheets of sediment) are among such microbe-influenced build-ups. Other types of microbial mat have created wrinkled "elephant skin" textures in marine sediments, although it was many years before these textures were recognized as trace fossils of mats. Microbial mats have increased the concentration of metal in many ore deposits, and without this it would not be feasible to mine them — examples include iron (both sulfide and oxide ores), uranium, copper, silver and gold deposits.
Role in the history of life.
The earliest mats.
Microbial mats are among the oldest clear signs of life, as microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) formed have been found in western Australia. At that early stage the mats' structure may already have been similar to that of modern mats that do not include photosynthesizing bacteria. It is even possible that non-photosynthesizing mats were present as early as . If so, their energy source would have been hydrothermal vents, high-pressure hot springs around submerged volcanoes; and the evolutionary split between bacteria and archea may also have occurred around this time.
The earliest mats were probably small, single-species biofilms of chemotrophs that relied on hydrothermal vents to supply both energy and chemical "food". Within a short time (by geological standards) the build-up of dead micro-organisms would have created an ecological niche for scavenging heterotrophs, possibly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms that would have formed new layers in the mats and enriched their supply of biologically useful chemicals.
Photosynthesis.
It is generally thought that photosynthesis, the biological generation of energy from light, evolved shortly after . However an isotope analysis suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis may have been widespread as early as . The eminent researcher into Earth's earliest life, William Schopf, argues that, if one did not know their age, one would classify some of the fossil organisms in Australian stromatolites from as cyanobacteria, which are oxygen-producing photosynthesizers. There are several different types of photosynthetic reaction, and analysis of bacterial DNA indicates that photosynthesis first arose in anoxygenic purple bacteria, while the oxygenic photosynthesis seen in cyanobacteria and much later in plants was the last to evolve.
The earliest photosynthesis may have been powered by infra-red light, using modified versions of pigments whose original function was to detect infra-red heat emissions from hydrothermal vents. The development of photosynthetic energy generation enabled the micro-organisms first to colonize wider areas around vents and then to use sunlight as an energy source. The role of the hydrothermal vents was now limited to supplying reduced metals into the oceans as a whole rather than being the main supporters of life in specific locations. Heterotrophic scavengers would have accompanied the photosynthesizers in their migration out of the "hydrothermal ghetto".
The evolution of purple bacteria, which do not produce or use oxygen but can tolerate it, enabled mats to colonize areas that locally had relatively high concentrations of oxygen, which is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it. Microbial mats would have been separated into oxidized and reduced layers, and this specialization would have increased their productivity. It may be possible to confirm this model by analyzing the isotope ratios of both carbon and sulfur in sediments laid down in shallow water.
The last major stage in the evolution of microbial mats was the appearance of cyanobacteria, photsynthesizers which both produce and use oxygen. This gave undersea mats their typical modern structure: an oxygen-rich top layer of cyanobacteria; a layer of photsynthesizing purple bacteria that could tolerate oxygen; and oxygen-free, H2S-dominated lower layers of heterotrophic scavengers, mainly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms.
It is estimated that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis increased biological productivity by a factor of between 100 and 1,000. All photosynthetic reactions require a reducing agent, but the significance of oxygenic photosynthesis is that it uses water as a reducing agent, and water is much more plentiful than the geologically produced reducing agents on which photosynthesis previously depended. The resulting increases in the populations of photosynthesizing bacteria in the top layers of microbial mats would have caused corresponding population increases among the chemotrophic and heterotrophic micro-organisms that inhabited the lower layers and which fed respectively on the by-products of the photosynthesizers and on the corpses and / or living bodies of the other mat organisms. These increases would have made microbial mats the planet's dominant ecosystems. From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes.
Oxygenic photosynthesis in microbial mats would also have increased the free oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, both directly by emitting oxygen and because the mats emitted molecular hydrogen (H2), some of which would have escaped from the Earth's atmosphere before it could re-combine with free oxygen to form more water. Microbial mats thus played a major role in the evolution of organisms which could first tolerate free oxygen and then use it as an energy source. Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it, but greatly increases the metabolic efficiency of oxygen-adapted organisms — for example anaerobic fermentation produces a net yield of two molecules of adenosine triphosphate, cells' internal "fuel", per molecule of glucose, while aerobic respiration produces a net yield of 36. The oxygenation of the atmosphere was a prerequisite for the evolution of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, from which all multicellular organisms are built.
Cyanobacteria have the most complete biochemical "toolkits" of all the mat-forming organisms: the photosynthesis mechanisms of both green bacteria and purple bacteria; oxygen production; and the Calvin cycle, which converts carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and sugars. It is likely that they acquired many of these sub-systems from existing mat organisms, by some combination of horizontal gene transfer and endosymbiosis followed by fusion. Whatever the causes, cyanobacteria are the most self-sufficient of the mat organisms and were well-adapted to strike out on their own both as floating mats and as the first of the phytoplankton, which forms the basis of most marine food chains.
Origin of eukaryotes.
The time at which eukaryotes first appeared is still uncertain: there is reasonable evidence that fossils dated between and represent eukaryotes, but the presence of steranes in Australian shales may indicate that eukaryotes were present . There is still debate about the origins of eukaryotes, and many of the theories focus on the idea that a bacterium first became an endosymbiont of an anaerobic archean and then fused with it to become one organism. If such endosymbiosis was an important factor, microbial mats would have encouraged it. There are two possible variations of this scenario:
Life on land.
Microbial mats from ~ provide the first evidence of life in the terrestrial realm.
The earliest multicellular "animals".
The Ediacara biota are the earliest widely accepted evidence of multicellular "animals". Most Ediacaran strata with the "elephant skin" texture characteristic of microbial mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils are hardly ever found in beds that do not contain these microbial mats.
"mat scratchers", which grazed the surface of the mat without destroying it; "mat stickers", suspension feeders that were partially embedded in the mat; and "undermat miners", which burrowed underneath the mat and fed on decomposing mat material.
The Cambrian substrate revolution.
In the Early Cambrian, however, organisms began to burrow vertically for protection or food, breaking down the microbial mats, and thus allowing water and oxygen to penetrate a considerable distance below the surface and kill the oxygen-intolerant micro-organisms in the lower layers. As a result of this Cambrian substrate revolution, marine microbial mats are confined to environments in which burrowing is non-existent or negligible: very harsh environments, such as hyper-saline lagoons or brackish estuaries, which are uninhabitable for the burrowing organisms that broke up the mats; rocky "floors" which the burrowers cannot penetrate; the depths of the oceans, where burrowing activity today is at a similar level to that in the shallow coastal seas before the revolution.
Current status.
Although the Cambrian substrate revolution opened up new niches for animals, it was not catastrophic for microbial mats, but it did greatly reduce their extent.
How microbial mats help paleontologists.
Most fossils preserve only the hard parts of organisms, e.g. shells. The rare cases where soft-bodied fossils are preserved (the remains of soft-bodied organisms and also of the soft parts of organisms for which only hard parts such as shells are usually found) are extremely valuable because they provide information about organisms that are hardly ever fossilized and much more information than is usually available about those for which only the hard parts are usually preserved. Microbial mats help to preserve soft-bodied fossils by:
Industrial uses.
The ability of microbial mat communities to use a vast range of "foods" has recently led to interest in industrial uses. There have been trials of microbial mats for purifying water, both for human use and in fish farming, and studies of their potential for cleaning up oil spills. As a result of the growing commercial potential, there have been applications for and grants of patents relating to the growing, installation and use of microbial mats, mainly for cleaning up pollutants and waste products.

Beecher's Trilobite type preservation

The preservational regime of Beecher's Trilobite Bed (Upper Ordovician) and other similar localities involves the replacement of soft tissues with pyrite, producing a three-dimensional fossil replicating the anatomy of the original organism. Only gross morphological information is preserved (unlike Orsten type phosphate replacement), although the fossils are compressed some relief is preserved (unlike Burgess Shale type preservation).
The pyrite formed in voids left when soft tissue had decayed, and the tough exoskeleton formed a cavity which could be filled by euhedral pyrite. Pyrite replacement of soft tissue can only occur in exceptional circumstances of sediment chemistry when there is a low organic content, but a high concentration of dissolved iron.
When a carcass is buried in such sediment, sulfate-reducing anaerobic bacteria break down its organic matter producing sulfide. The high concentration of iron in the sediment converts this to iron mono-sulfide. Finally, aerobic bacteria convert this by oxidation to pyrite. The requirement of early anaerobic and later aerobic bacteria means that the pyritisation must occur in the upper levels of the sediment, close to the aerobic-anaerobic interface. If the organic content of the sediment is too high the dissolved iron precipitates in the sediment and not in the carcass. Seawater sulfate ions diffusing toward animal carcasses enabled sulfate-reducing bacteria to oxidize the reactive organic matter of these remains, but the sulfide produced reacted promptly with the abundant Fe2+ ions of the pore water and pyrite precipitated right on the organic remains.

Love Is Noise

"Love Is Noise" is a song by English alternative rock band The Verve and is the second track on their fourth album, "Forth". It was released as the first single from the album on 3 August 2008 as a digital download, with the physical release on 11 August 2008 in the United Kingdom (see 2008 in British music). The song received its first airplay by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on 23 June 2008. The promo video for the song debuted on the band's MySpace on 9 July.
Richard Ashcroft stated that lyrically the song is a take off of William Blake's "And did those feet in ancient time", commonly known as 'Jerusalem'. Whereas in Blake's song the title verse is "and did those feet in ancient time. Walk upon England's mountains green?" Love is Noise asks: "Will those feet in modern times / Walk on soles that are made in China?", and allusion to "Bright prosaic malls" instead of "dark Satanic mills". This is the second time Richard Ashcroft has referenced Blake, following 1995's "History".
"Love Is Noise" derived from another song off the album, "Columbo". While recording that track Richard created a new loop on a vocoder and added it to the song. "Columbo" was practically a jam the band had been working on for a couple of days. After that loop was added, all the band started adding some stuff on to it until finally, it evolved into a different track.
The song has been played live as early as the late 2007 gigs, but was given different names such as "Modern Times", "Love is Pain", "Love is noise (with boy)". The band played it with a huge warm reception at 2008's Coachella as the setlist's closer, something that was repeated in Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage on 29 June.
The video for the song was released on the band's MySpace. The video mixes up shots of the band performing in a dimly-lit room, with frontman Richard Ashcroft sitting on the floor, with montages of other images, including snow-capped mountains, a North Korean choreography, a couple about to kiss, a dancer and a blonde woman with an eagle.
The single debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #5 after its first week of release via online download alone. The following week the song peaked at #4 and stayed 5 weeks in the UK Top 10. It marked a great return for The Verve, charting as their third UK Top 5 single and their fourth to crack the UK Top 10. It had great success around Europe, charting on the Top 20 for 6 weeks so far. It also reached the Top 10 in Ireland, Malta, Sweden, and Italy.
Track listings.
On 3 August a digital download of the "album version" of the song was released with the song's video in the iTunes Store. A week later, an exclusive iTunes Store bundle was released featuring a "Freelance Hellraiser" remix at the same time as another bundle featuring the "album version" and the physical format's B-sides. The physical formats (CD and 7" vinyl records) were released on 11 August 2008.

World Rivers Day

World Rivers Day is a global celebration of the world's waterways, observed every last Sunday in September. Established in 2005, it highlights the many values of rivers and strives to increase public awareness while encouraging the improved stewardship of rivers around the world. World Rivers Day occurs annually on the last Sunday in September.
Promoting River Stewardship.
Rivers in every country face an array of threats, and World Rivers Day promotes the active involvement of citizens to ensure the health of rivers in the years ahead. Events include riverside cleanups, habitat restoration, nature walks, paddle trips, school projects, art displays, music festivals, and parades. Citizens are encouraged to join an event in their area, or start one of their own.
United Nations links.
World Rivers Day has been endorsed by various agencies of the United Nations and is intended to complement the broader efforts of the United Nations Water For Life Decade. The event was launched with the support of the United Nations University through the International Network on Water, Environment, and Health. The UN Water for Life - Canadian initiative has also been a strong supporter.
Origins of World Rivers Day.
World Rivers Day is based on the great success of BC Rivers Day in British Columbia, Canada which started in 1980. The BC event was founded by acclaimed river conservationist, Mark Angelo, who also served as the inaugural World Rivers Day Chair. Under Mr. Angelo's leadership, BC Rivers Day grew to the point where it attracted up to 100,000 participants across the province and its success also inspired the creation Canadian Rivers Day. When the United Nations launched the Water for Life Decade initiative in 2005, Angelo believed that a grassroots-led international event focusing on the need to better care for the world's waterways would be a great complement to this event. After extensive communications with environmental non-government organizations along with lobbying various UN agencies, the first World Rivers Day took place in 2005 and was embraced by millions of people in close to 30 countries.

He became noted after his death for his charity and love for the poor. A legend told of him states that one day, while plowing a field, Fortunatus found two coins of apparently little value. He placed them in his pocket. That evening, upon meeting a poor man upon the road, Fortunatus decided to give the man the two coins. The sunlight suddenly illuminated the two coins, making them shine like gold. Not wishing to be tempted by avarice, Fortunatus quickly gave the small treasure to the poor man and hurried away. 
After his death, Fortunatus became the focus of a local cult, and the Convent of San Fortunato near Montefalco was dedicated to him.

The official scenario, however, states that his death occurred after he fell from the stairs while being drunk. In 2011 his body was examined, and the outcome states that it was the fall that caused his death and that he had not been beaten.
Oppositional activities.
Stanisław Pyjas was born on August 4, 1953 in Żywiec. After graduation from a local high school, he moved to Kraków, to begin studies at the renowned Jagiellonian University. He studied Polish philology and philosophy.
Some time in 1976 Pyjas joined the Workers' Defence Committee, the organization which was created to help laborers, participants in the anticommunist street protests in Radom and Warsaw. Together with friends from the University, Bronisław Wildstein and Lesław Maleszka, Pyjas organized protests against repressions.
Death.
Pyjas’ body was found on May 7, 1977, in the staircase located in a building at 7 Szewska Street in Kraków’s historic center. His death shook the student community, with around 1,000 people showing up at the funeral in the village of Gilowice. Street demonstrations, such as Kraków’s Black March, erupted in several Polish cities and soon afterwards, Polish students, shaken by the death of their colleague, founded the Student Committee of Solidarity. On May 15, 1977, after a Black March, the founders urged the Polish government to reveal who was behind the crime. Among members of the Committee was the current prime minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, and it was the first organization of this kind in Eastern Europe.
Aftermath.
The perpetrators of the crime have never been found. Three different investigations, carried out by the local prosecutor’s office and Milicja Obywatelska, stalled and finally ended, due to lack of evidence.
Officially, Kraków doctor Zdzisław Marek stated that Pyjas, drunk, fell down the stairs, but Pyjas’ friends did not believe it. Bronisław Wildstein stated that he bribed a worker at the mortuary in Kraków and entered the premises, to check the body of his fellow student. According to him, it was clear that Pyjas had been brutally beaten to death.
A few weeks after Pyjas’ death, the body of another student, Stanisław Pietraszka, was found in the Solina Lake. According to his brother, it must have been a murder, as Pietraszka was afraid of water. He was the last person to have seen Pyjas alive and he gave a description of the possible murderer. Also, a person suspected of murder, a boxer of Cracovia, Marian Weclewicz, died in a mysterious accident.
The role of Leslaw Maleszka.
In late June 2008, private television TVN presented a documentary "Trzech kumpli" ("Three mates"), which presented the story of Wildstein, Pyjas and Lesław Maleszka (aka "Ketman" and "Return"). All three of them were friends in college, studied together and were active in anticommunist opposition. However, Maleszka, who afterwards worked for Gazeta Wyborcza, was a secret informer of Służba Bezpieczeństwa.
Maleszka was a highly praised agent, whose reports on students in Kraków, in which he did not hesitate to describe the intimate lives of his closest friends, were called "excellent" by his secret service bosses. According to Roman Graczyk, a journalist and Maleszka’s friend from university, Pyjas had to die, because he might have suspected Maleszka of collaboration. The secret services did not want to lose such a valuable agent and an unknown officer ordered the assassination.
On September 23, 2006, Pyjas was posthumously awarded the Commander's Cross of the Polonia Restituta, by president Lech Kaczyński.

The airport was actually created by the U.S Air Force in June, 1070.
After the May 31, 1970 earthquake, the 39th Tactical Airlift Squadron on rotational duty at Howard AFB, Canal Zone sent C-130's to Lima to support the relief efforts. Upon arriving at Lima Colonel Beckett (the squadron commander), Ssgt Richard Eubanks and Sgt Leonard Holmes (both Combat Controllers), Mrs. Consuelo de Velasco (Peru's first lady) and US Ambasssador Taylor Belcher flew over the disaster area to survey the damage and determine the best method to reach the area.
The decision was made that the dirt road going through Anta would be the best bet for possible landings so Ssgt Eubanks and Sgt Holmes deployed to Anta and began work to convert that dirt road into a runway that would eventually become the Anta Airport.

Jean Royer

Jean Royer (31 October 1920 – 25 March 2011) was a French catholic and conservative politician, former Minister, and former Mayor of Tours.
Biography.
Mayor of Tours.
Born in Nevers, Nièvre, Royer was at first a teacher. In 1958 he was elected as a right-wing deputy from the Indre-et-Loire department, representing the city of Tours. While he was close to the Gaullist UNR, he did not join a parliamentary group. In 1959, he was elected to the office of Mayor of Tours, with the support of Charles de Gaulle.
In the 1960s he led an expansion of the city, annexing the cities of Sainte-Radegonde-en-Touraine and de Saint-Symphorien in order to increase the surface area available for more constructions. His main accomplishment was the construction, in an area of four kilometres along the Cher River, of housing and parks. This area included an artificial lake. He sparked controversy by supporting the construction of the A10 along Tours.
Described, within his own party, as an autocrat, Royer led a staunch policy vis-a-vis of social evolutions in the 1960s and 1970s. He outlawed pornographic films and brothels. In 1968 he expelled from Tours Michel-Georges Micberth, who had founded a psychological and pathological research center.
1974 candidacy.
In 1973 he entered the Pierre Messmer government, leaving his seat vacant but stayed on as Mayor of Tours. During his tenure as Minister of Commerce, in December 1973, he wrote the Royer Law that regulated the construction of supermarkets that were more than 1000 m². In early 1974, he briefly served as Minister of the PTT. On 11 April, he resigned from the government to be a candidate in the 1974 presidential election.
He stood as the candidate of moral order, and polled up to 7%. However, his candidacy became a fiasco. He multiplied gaffes: he resigned from the government, unlike Valéry Giscard d'Estaing; he installed his headquarters in Tours and not in Paris, and refused to take the plane during the campaign. His meetings were also a fiasco, in Toulouse the majority of his listeners were young students who laughed at him and yelled obscene sexual slogans. A young woman even went to the extent of undressing in front of the camera.
He won 810,540 votes, or 3.17%. Most of his votes came from Indre-et-Loire, where he broke 30%.
Later life.
After the presidential fiasco, Royer returned to Tours and won his old seat back in a by-election in 1976. His term as mayor became difficult in the wake of the economic crises. In the 1980s the city was hit by economic stagnation and many factories in the suburbs closed down, such as SKF in 1989. He was, however, credited with the extension of the TGV line to Tours and the construction of a congress center. Following his re-election in the 1993 election he joined the parliamentary group République et liberté (composed of the Left Radical Party, the MDC, and other independents). He also served as leader of République et liberté.
In the 1995 local elections, he was defeated in his bid for re-election in a three-way race with the PS and RPR. The PS Jean Germain was elected.
In the 2002 presidential election he supported the candidacy of Jean-Pierre Chevènement, before retiring from politics. In 2004 and 2007 he was hospitalized for "serious" health issues.
In October 2013 a statue of Royer was erected in Place de la Liberte, Tours. The cost of 44,000 Euros being raised by public subscription.

Peter O'Grady

Peter ‘Hawker’ O’Grady, brother of the famous Hugo O'Grady, was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Blackrock and with the Cork senior inter-county team in the 1920s and 1930s.
Playing career.
Club.
O’Grady played his club hurling with the famous Blackrock club and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county titles in 1924 and 1925, however, St. Finbarr’s caught Blackrock in the final of 1926. The following year O’Grady won his third county medal. Blackrock failed to reach the final in 1928, however, in 1929 he won his fourth county title. It was the first of three-in-a-row for O’Grady, bringing his county medal tally to six. The 1931 final victory was O’Grady’s last big occasion with Blackrock. The club would not win another county title until 1956.
Inter-county.
O’Grady first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Cork in the late 1920s. He made his debut in 1928 as Cork faced Clare in the Munster final for the second year in-a-row. That game ended in a draw, however, in the replay Cork triumphed with O’Grady collecting his first Munster title. Cork later defeated Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the championship decider. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, however, the game turned into a rout. A score line of 6-12 to 1-0 gave Cork the victory and gave O’Grady a coveted All-Ireland medal.
In 1929 Cork retained their provincial dominance for a fourth consecutive year. A 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford gave O’Grady his second Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year’s game as Cork played Galway once again. Mick Ahern scored a goal for Cork after just 25 seconds to start another rout. Cork won the day by 4-9 to 1-3 giving O’Grady his second All-Ireland title.
In 1930 O’Grady added a National Hurling League title to his collection; however, Cork surrendered their provincial crown later that summer. The team bounced back in 1931 with O’Grady collecting a third Munster winners’ medal. Once again it took a replay for Cork and Waterford to be separated. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the first time since 1926. After a close game both sides finished level – 1-6 apiece. Eudie Coughlan played a captain’s role in that game as he scored a point from his knees to level the scores. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back. Once again both sides finished level – 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, this was rejected. It was also suggested at a meeting of the GAA’s Central Council that both counties be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. At the third attempt Cork triumphed by 5-8 to 3-4 giving O’Grady his third and final All-Ireland medal.

A Journal to Stella

A Journal to Stella is a work by Jonathan Swift first partly published posthumously in 1766.
It consists of 65 letters to his friend, Esther Johnson, whom he called "Stella" and whom he may have secretly married. They were written between 1710 and 1713, from various locations in England, and though clearly intended for Stella's eyes were sometimes addressed to her companion Rebecca Dingley.
Amongst the references to contemporaries of Dean Swift, frequent mention is made of Elizabeth Germain. There is also mention of St. George Ashe, Bishop of Clogher, an old friend who by some accounts secretly married Swift to Stella in 1716.

The entire Kompienga river basin did in fact experience a sudden, dramatic increase in agricultural immigration after 1985, particularly in the area immediately adjacent to the dam construction site, which became Kompienga town. 
However the creation of the lake and dam had consequences on some villages along the basin which were either totally or partially flooded by the dam-created lake.

At 10:10am "Attack" sighted "U-12" and opened fire. "Ariel" sighted the submarine at 10:12am at about and all three destroyers turned towards it. "U-12" dived and raised her periscope, which "Ariel" sighted at a distance of . She turned to ram, sighting the conning tower under the water in the final moments before she struck the submarine at a fine angle. Within two minutes the submarine had returned to the surface so that the crew could escape, but they found the conning tower hatch jammed, and most of the survivors managed their escape via the other hatches. "Acheron" and the other destroyers opened fire as the submarine lay on the surface, killing and injuring some of the escaping sailors. At 10:30am "U-12" sank approximately in position , and the destroyers picked up 10 survivors; 19 lives had been lost. The damage to "Ariel"s bows was so serious that she had to be towed into port.

Shock (1977 film)

Shock (original title: Schock; also released as Beyond the Door II) is a 1977 Italian horror film directed by Mario Bava. It was Bava's last film before he died of a heart attack in 1980. The film stars Daria Nicolodi, John Steiner and David Colin, Jr.
Plot.
Dora Baldini (Daria Nicolodi), her son Marco (David Colin Jr.) and her new husband Bruno Baldini (John Steiner) move into Dora's former home, from her first marriage, after Dora is released from a mental institution following the mysterious death of Dora's abusive first husband. With Bruno away as a commercial airline pilot, Dora is left along with her son Marco and her shattered memory of the events of her husband's death, caused by extensive electroshock treatment she received while institutionalized. Her insanity grows when she believes that her son has become possessed by the ghost of his deceased father, leading to Dora learning the truth about her first husband's death: she murdered him after he forcibly injected her with heroin and LSD. When she contacted Bruno for help, he arranged for her dead husband's body to be dumped out in the ocean while arranging for Dora to be placed in an insane asylum, as the drugs injected into her caused her to have a nervous breakdown. Now killing her new husband, Dora is compelled by her husband's ghost (and her guilt) to commit suicide. The ending shows Marco, the sole survivor, having tea with his parents' ghosts (who are invisible).
Release.
For its US release, Film Ventures International decided to rename the film "Beyond the Door II", under the guise of it being a "sequel" to Ovidio G. Assonitis's 1974 film "Chi sei?", renamed "Beyond the Door" for US release. The reason for the change was the fact that the two films starred child actor David Colin Jr. as a boy possessed. 
In spite of this false rebranding of the film through its renaming, Film Ventures International was quite faithful with its English dubbing of "Shock". Lamberto Bava's script was adapted quite faithfully and unlike "Lisa and the Devil", did not include any reshoots or omission of footage, making it one of the few films by Mario Bava to appear in the US intact.
Critical reception.
AllMovie called it "perhaps one of the more conventional offerings from a man whom many consider the founding father of Italian horror", though it "still bears the trademark style and technical trickery of Mario Bava's previous efforts".

Danny Heater (born 1942) is an American record holder for the highest single game scoring performance by one player in high school basketball history worldwide. 
On January 26, 1960, Heater, a then-17 year old senior at Burnsville High School in Braxton County, West Virginia scored 135 points against Widen High School of Clay County. In the 32-minute game, Heater made 53 of 70 field goal attempts and 29 of 41 free throws. While Danny is best remembered for the controversial scoring exploit, he also grabbed 32 rebounds and dished out 7 assists in the game. 
Heater was encouraged before the historic game, by teammates and coach alike, to try to break the state of West Virginia all-time record of 74 points. By halftime, Heater had scored 50 points, and capped off his 85-point second half with his final 55 points in the last 10 minutes alone.
The record is certified by National Federation of State High School Associations and is the highest total ever on a high school or professional level in the United States. It is 35 more points than Wilt Chamberlain's NBA record of 100, but three fewer points than Jack Taylor's 138 of NCAA Division III Grinnell College.
Danny Heater is now retired and lives in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia with his wife.

Latvia–Russia relations

Latvia–Russia relations (, ) is the bilateral foreign relations between Latvia and Russia. Latvia has an embassy in Moscow and two consulates general: in Pskov and Saint Petersburg. Russia has an embassy in Riga and two consulates general: in Daugavpils and Liepāja.
Both Russia and Latvia are members of UN, OSCE and Council of Europe. They have recognized each other since 1991.
History.
In 2007, the border treaty between the two states was ratified, after the Constitutional Court of Latvia found it constitutional.
In 1920 - 1940, relations between the countries had existed, too (but in 1922 USSR had been founded, which took over the foreign affairs of its member states, including Russia).
Latvia and Estonia have considered nuclear power as a way to cut their energy dependence on Russia.
Withdrawal of Russian of troops and the decommissioning of Skrunda-1.
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation maintained its military presence in Latvia. It had troops stationed there and it continued to run the Skrunda-1 radar station. As early as 1992 Russia agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Latvia. Following an 30 April 1994 agreement, Latvia allowed Russia to run the Skrunda-1 radar station for four more years in exchange for the full withdrawal of the Russian troops. Russia adhered to this agreement and withdrew its remaining troops from Latvia in August 1994 (except for the troops stationed around Skrunda, who received permission to stay longer). One of the towers of the Skrunda-1 base was demolished with the help of the United States in May 1995. In August 1998, Skrunda-1 suspended operations. Russia eventually dismantled the equipment and withdrew its remaining military personnel the following year. These steps marked a symbolic end to the Russian military presence and World War II on the territory of Latvia.
Violation of minority rights.
Russia often criticizes Latvia for discriminating against the Russian-speaking population. Russia has also participated in a number of cases of complaints against Latvia in the European Court of Human Rights as a third party. These cases also dealt with the violation of the rights of the Russian minority in Latvia. Such cases included "Slivenko v. Latvia", "Kononov v. Latvia", "Vikulov and others v. Latvia", "Sisojeva And Others v Latvia", and "Vasilevskiy v. Latvia".
Bilateral agreements.
While some agreements have been signed by representatives of Latvia and Russia, not all have been passed by their respective legislatures and are therefore not in force. This list is limited to agreements in force.

Mick O'Connell (hurler)

Mick O'Connell was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club St. Finbarr's and with the Cork senior inter-county team in the 1920s and 1930s.
Playing career.
Club.
O'Connell played his club hurling with the famous St. Finbarr's club and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county titles in 1922 and 1923. Three years later in 1926 O'Connell added to his medal collection by picking up another county title. He finished off his career by capturing back-to-back county medals n 1932 and 1933.
Inter-county.
O'Connell first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Cork in 1926. That year he came on as a substitute to collect his first Munster title. O'Connell played no part in the subsequent All-Ireland final which Cork won.
Cork retained their Munster title in 1927 with a 5-3 to 3-4 victory over Clare. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Dublin once again. Cork fell behind by 2-3 to 0-1 at half-time; however, they fought back in the second-half. In a team made up of nine members of the Garda Síochána ‘the Dubs’ claimed the victory by 4-8 to 1-3.
In 1928 Cork faced Clare in the Munster final for the second year in-a-row. That game ended in a draw, however, in the replay Cork triumphed with O'Connell collecting his third consecutive Munster title. Cork later defeated Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the championship decider. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, however, the game turned into a rout. A score line of 6-12 to 1-0 gave Cork the victory and gave O'Connell his first All-Ireland medal.
In 1929 Cork retained their provincial dominance for a fourth consecutive year. A 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford gave O'Connell his second Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year’s game as Cork played Galway once again. Mick Ahern scored a goal for Cork after just 25 seconds to start another rout. Cork won the day by 4-9 to 1-3 giving O'Connell his second All-Ireland title.
In 1930 O'Connell added a National Hurling League title to his collection; however, Cork surrendered their provincial crown later that summer. The team bounced back in 1931 with O'Connell collecting a third Munster winners’ medal. Once again it took a replay for Cork and Waterford to be separated. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the first time since 1926. After a close game both sides finished level – 1-6 apiece. Eudie Coughlan played a captain’s role in that game as he scored a point from his knees to level the scores. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back. Once again both sides finished level – 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, this was rejected. It was also suggested at a meeting of the GAA’s Central Council that both counties be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. At the third attempt Cork triumphed by 5-8 to 3-4 giving O'Connell his third and final All-Ireland medal.
Provincial.
O'Connell also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He captured a Railway Cup medal in 1930 as Munster defeated Leinster.

Richard Watts

Richard Watts (1529–1579) was a successful businessman and MP for Rochester, South East England, in the 1570s. He supplied rations for the English Navy as deputy victualler and supervised the construction of Upnor Castle. After Queen Elizabeth I pronounced his house was "satis" (Latin for enough) after a visit in 1573, the house was thereafter known as Satis House. Famed locally for his philanthropy, he died on 10 September 1579, leaving money in his will to establish the Richard Watts Charity and Six Poor Travellers House in Rochester High Street. He is buried, in accordance with his will, in Rochester Cathedral.
Biography.
The precise date and place of Richard's birth is uncertain. A Richard Watts born in West Peckham in 1529 is believed to be Richard Watts of Rochester. However, there is evidence of an older Richard Watts living on Boley Hill, at a date during the supposed childhood of the Richard Watts born in West Peckham. Little is known of the early life of Richard Watts. He may have spent his youth in Rochester gaining employment with Bishop (later Saint) John Fisher. Following the arrest and execution of Fisher, Watts returned to Rochester in a state of poverty.
By 1550 Richard Watts was established as a merchant. Payments were made to him for victualling the army and navy in 1550 and 1551. In either 1552 (Lane & Singh) or 1554 (Hinkley) he was appointed deputy victualler of the navy. The earlier date fits in with the grant of a coat of arms in 1553. In 1559 he was reappointed to the post. Subsequently Queen Elizabeth I appointed him as paymaster and surveyor of works when building of Upnor Castle started in 1560. A further royal appointment, that of surveyor of ordnance, followed in 1562. In 1560 as well as his appointment to the castle he became paymaster to the Wardens of Rochester Bridge. In 1563 he was elected as MP for Rochester which seat he held until 1571.
Richard died on 10 September 1579 at home. His will starts with "First
I bequeath my Soule unto the Holy Trinity as is aforesaid and my Body to be buried
in The Cathedrall Church of Rochester aforesaid neare unto the Steeple and
Staires going up into the Quire on the South side of the same Staires". His
will goes on to describe a procession from his house to the cathedral complete
with curate and the "singing children" from the cathedral all "in their
Surplices". After a service and sermon he was to be buried. Various
disbursements are made to those taking part, including to the sextons for
digging the grave and ringing his knell "with all the bells". Even the
congregation was remembered for unto every "poore Body" attending the burial
he left "One penney in bread and One penny in money". He earmarked five pounds
for this so was assuming an attendance of some 600 poor mourners.
His grave, with coat of arms and simple inscription, is close to the south side of the pulpitum steps, just where he wanted it. In 1730, just over 150 years after his death, the city council resolved to erect a monument to his memory. A Mr. Charles Easton was tasked with the same for a sum of £50. The memorial in the south transept of the cathedral incorporates the bust mentioned above. The bust appears to have been given by Josiah Brooke the current owner of Satis house, for below the bust and above the inscription a bold statement testifies: "Archetypum hunc dedit IOS. BROOKE de SATIS Arm".
The will.
Watts' instructions for his funeral take up the first quarter of his will. The next part of the will leaves money and income to his wife and details what should happen if she remarried, which she in due course did. A few other family bequests follow, then the main charitable section starts. The old almshouse beside the market cross was to be extended and refurbished with provision for casual travellers. There was provision for raw materials to be given to the poor to enable them to earn a living. Later the Mayor, principal citizens and commonalty of Rochester are enjoined to "preserve and maintain the stocke" so that the "yearely gaine and proffitts thereof riseing shall imploy to the uses and purposes aforesaid ... principally to the reliefe and comfort of the said poore Travellers". He laid upon his heirs the duty to supervise the Mayor and appointed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Rochester as having the final say in any disposals.
The will was proved on 25 September 1579 "in common form" and before witnesses on 25 November the following year. City accounts for 1579 show that this was not without cost: a gallon of wine to the Bishop's chancellor for the proving (2s), a trip to London (13s 4d), a copy of the will (5s) and others "aboute the probate" (20s 10d). £2-1-2 was a fair sum in those days.
The will was not without its problems. Some of the properties disposed of were jointly owned with his wife, who therefore became the sole owner on his death. Some of the lands he had bequeathed had reverted (either on death or previously) to former owners, including a set of tenements which the Bishop took back. Marian did remarry and according to the will should have lost the house. However she and her new husband, a lawyer named Thomas Pagitt, wished to keep the house.
In 1593 a document was drawn up between the four parties interested in the will: Thomas & Marian, Mayor & citizens, Dean & Chapter, and the Bridge Wardens. The document was called the "Indenture Quadripartite". In brief (the indenture is over 14 pages long when set in modern print) Marian was allowed to keep the house in return for giving up all other claims and returning the 100 marks left to her in the original will. The bulk of the document establishes the form and government of the charity which now bears Richard Watts' name.
Richard Watts Charities.
Richard Watts' will when proved in 1579 provided for an almshouse in Rochester High Street. now known as the Six Poor Travellers House, to be expanded and maintained. The "Indenture Quadripartite" of 1593 established the form and government of Richard Watts Charity which over time built other almshouses and expanded to incorporate several local charities, such as St Catherine's Hospital founded under the charity of Symond Potyn in 1315. Richard Watts Charities, as of 2013, provides 66 self-contained flats in Rochester which includes almshouses in Maidstone Road built in 1857.
1853 onwards.
The Charitable Trusts Act of 1853 brought a large number of independent trusts and charities under the supervision of the newly created Charity Commissioners. Watts' Charity was no exception. A new scheme was devised for the running of the charity. The charity was run buy Municipal Trustees who appointed a Clerk and Receiver. They also appointed a Master and Matron to manage the poor travellers house. £4,000 was used to build a new set of almshouses for 20 people in Maidstone Road. £100 was set aside to provide an apprenticeship premium for children who had distinguished themselves at school. £2,000 was spent on the building of the Watts Public Baths with £200 per annum for maintenance. In 1935 they passed into the hands of the Corporation of Rochester though the annual grant towards costs continued for a further 20 years.
£4,000 was granted to the Trustees of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Rochester to enable them to build a "Hospital and Dispensary for the relief of the Sick poor". The charity was also to pay £1,000 (later raised to £1,500) per annum to the hospital and gained the right to nominate as patients up to 20 people at any one time. These donations were maintained until 1948 until the hospital came under the control of the National Health Service.
In 1886 there was a further scheme extending the work of the charity. 11 outpensions of 7/- (35p) per week were established and two exhibitions of £100 made available annually, one each to Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School and Rochester Grammar School for Girls. There were five exhibitions for pupil teachers, each of £6/5/0 annually for three years. The Watts Nursing Service was established with two full-time nurses (one midwife, one district) and six occasional nurses.
The 1934 supplementary scheme increased certain payments and handed the baths over to the council.
Post war.
The 1942 Beveridge Report led to the establishment of the modern British Welfare State. The previous, limited, National Insurance Act 1911 was extended to most workers by the National Insurance Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 1946 introduced universal health care and the National Assistance Act provided a safety net replacing the old Poor Laws. The upshot was that by 1950 much of the charity's former purpose had been taken over by the state.
A review of operations led to the scheme of 1954. Some money was available to help travellers in need of financial assistance and some for "amenities or samaritan funds" at hospitals within the city. Some money was available for apprenticeships, for books, tools, fees and examinations. Power was obtained for discretionary grants to relieve hardship or distress, either directly or via other institutions.
By 1976 sufficient funds were available to extend the almshouses. In 1977 yet another scheme came into operation. Several charities, some of which were already administered by the Trustees of Richard Watts Charity were amalgamated under the title: "Richard Watts and the City of Rochester Almshouse Charities":
Watts' Nursing Service.
The scheme of 1855 set up a nursing service to provide maternity care and to care for the afflicted poor of the parish. Any of the inmates of the Almshouses were able to call on their services in time of sickness. Care was free. A Head Nurse supervised the service, relying on nurses to provide the actual care. The Head Nurse periodically attended on all those in the care of nurses to check on the standard of work. She also had to visit all inmates of the almshouses once a week, ensure adequate fire precautions and prepare the boardroom for meetings.
Things did not always go smoothly. Thomas Aveling complained in January 1871 about "the reported inefficiency of the Nurses ... more than twlve months since", which is interesting because as mayor 1869–70 he had a level of supervision of the charity. On 2 June 1871 he was appointed to be a trustee at around the same time he left the council.
During the 1930s home-helps were employed by the charity to assist new mothers for up to 21 days after the birth. They were expected to attend from 8 am to 8 pm and to cook, supervise older children (getting them to school and afterwards to bed) and wash the children's clothes. Washing the patient and making the bed were, however, the prerogative of the nurse. Although the scheme seemed to work well, it was too expensive for the charity and the home-helps were discontinued after 1938.
The scheme was not without problems. In 1941 the Royal College of Nursing exprtessed concern to the trustees for "advertising for a SRN Registered Nurse for district work at a salary of £130 p.a.". Eventually an increase of £50 p.a. was agreed for each nurse. In 1945 the Nurses' Salaries Commission reported and the Ministry of Health established norms for the profession. Thereafter the rates agreed by the Whitley Council were paid.
The coming of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1946 brought a dramatic change to the charity. The county council had the task of organising a free home nursing service for all persons who needed it. Local organisations could participate, they would need to fund 25% of the cost, the county providing the remaining 75%. The charity's nursing service was incorporated on this basis into the NHS with the county funding £2,000 and the charity £1,500. The Charity Commissioners were not happy with a charity becoming permanently involved in the NHS and only permitted the arrangement to run until December 1950. The nursing service continued to provide a reduced independent service until all patients were transferred to the NHS on 31 March 1958. The Nursing Branch of the charity then ceased to exist.
Watts Public Baths.
The 1855 scheme empowered the trustees to erect public baths and washouses. There was a site by the river which had been occupied by the baths of the Castle Club. The trustees duly obtained it and built new baths, opening in 1880. Both private baths and swimming baths were provided. The swimming baths were used by schools and between 1882 and 1925 some three and a half thousand children had learnt to swim there. The baths were never run profitably, a yearly grant of £200 from the charity being required. Finally in 1935 the baths were handed over to Rochester Corporation, though the annual grant remained for a further 15 years.
Satis House.
Queen Elizabeth I was the guest of Richard Watts during her royal progress of 1573. When he asked her if his house was to her liking, she replied 'Satis' (Latin for 'enough'). The house was thereafter known as 'Satis House'.
Archbishop Longley was born in Satis house in 1794.
The house has been rebuilt and is now the administration building for The King's School, Rochester. A bust of Watts has been set on top of the building's portico. Although Charles Dickens in his novel Great Expectations used the name Satis House for Miss Havisham's house, his biographer, John Forster, felt that some aspects of the fictitious Satis House were modelled on nearby Restoration House.

Four for Trane is a studio album by Archie Shepp released on Impulse! Records in 1964. Three of the five tracks are reworkings of pieces originally recorded on co-producer John Coltrane's 1960 "Giant Steps" and "Coltrane Plays The Blues", rearranged by Shepp and Roswell Rudd.
Reception.
"The Penguin Guide to Jazz" selected this album as part of its suggested "Core Collection" calling it "one of the classic jazz albums of the '60s and a fascinating glimpse into how thoroughly different what was already thought of as the Coltrane revolution might sound." The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek states that ""Four for Trane" is a truly fine, original, and lasting album from an under-celebrated musician".

Columbia MM

Columbia MM (Mail Manager) is a computer program for reading email using a command-line interface. It was developed at Columbia University between 1984 and 1990, and is a Unix reimplementation of a 1978 TOPS-20 email program, also known as MM, which in turn was an update of an earlier program by Michael McMahon of SRI International. Columbia MM has also been built on other platforms, including DOS and VMS.
MM was unusual for its time in its support of "message sequences," which allowed the user to select a subset of messages in a mailbox for batch operations. The message sequence feature proved so popular with MM users that TOPS-20 MM author Mark Crispin went on to implement similar filtering capabilities in Pine. Columbia MM also offered context-sensitive help, command completion, and command history, carried over from the TOPS-20 version, before such features were commonplace in Unix software.
After a lull in development in 1990, MM development picked up again in 2002 with an interim release, including changes for Linux portability and POP support.
History.
At Columbia University in the late 1970s the DEC-20 based MM was adopted in favor of DEC-20 MAIL and RDMAIL, and was used initially among the programming staff. Its use spread to the students and faculty, to the extent that several courses came to use it heavily. It was likely that, if you did a SYSTAT on any DEC-20 at Columbia between 1978 and 1988, you would see about half the users running EMACS and the other half MM, with only occasional time out for text formatting, program compilation, and file transfer. When Columbia switched to Unix based platforms during the 1980s the MM program was rewritten for that platform and development continued on the program for the next 20 years. 
As of version 0.91 (2003)MM worked on the following platforms:Solaris (2.5.1 and later); SunOS 4.1; Linux (e.g. RH7.1); FreeBSD 4.4; OpenBSD 3.0, NetBSD 1.5.2.

BR Standard Class 5 73096

British Railways Standard Class 5 No. 73096 is a preserved British steam locomotive. Unnamed in service, it is now operated by the Mid-Hants Railway on the Watercress Line between Alresford and Alton.
In its new lease of life as a tourist attraction, 73096 has been temporarily disguised as 73080 "Merlin" and as 73054, for special events and commemorations.
Locomotive History.
73096 was built at the Derby Works in November 1955 and was used on the London Midland and Western Regions of British Railways. It was withdrawn from service in November 1967.
Preservation.
Rescued from the scrapyard in July 1985, 73096 was returned to service in October 1993, following major boiler overhaul and the construction of a new tender, based on the chassis from a "Jubilee" class tender.
73096's boiler certificate expired in September 2011 and has now been withdrawn from service.
Cylinder failure.
This engine suffered over £200,000 worth of damages during the 14 March 2009 Spring Steam Gala Services on the Mid Hants Railway. Whilst on the first Alresford to Alton service of the day, 73096 suffered major damage to its left-hand (driver's-side) cylinder, at Wander's Curve in the Ropley to Medstead section, about ¾ of a mile from Ropley station. It is thought a piston coreplug worked loose thus causing much damage to the cylinder covers, cylinder, piston and piston-rod plus other equipment in the area. There is no evidence that this was caused by priming (water in the cylinders, which can cause similar catastrophic failures) and, currently (March 2009), the crew are absolved of any blame.
No damage was done to the track or signalling but No. 73096 blocked the line for some time. Shuttle services were quickly organised between Alresford and Ropley and between Alton and Medstead, until the line could be cleared. Parts of the steam locomotive's 'motion' (connecting rod, valve gear linkages etc.) on the driver's side had to be removed by MPD staff to allow the locomotive to be moved. As the 5MT was unable to move under its own power, a diesel locomotive was dispatched from Ropley engine shed to retrieve it. The Gala thereafter continued with a revised timetable.
A replacement cylinder casting was required, necessitating a new pattern made. As of the week commencing 9 August 2010, the locomotive was running again, hauling services on the line during the 'Day Out With Thomas' event.

Practitioner-teacher model

Creation.
The modern history of the practitioner-teacher model dates back to 1972, when Rush-Presbyterian-St.-Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, established Rush University, a health sciences university that was designed to be a fully integrated subsidiary of the medical center. This unique structure was dubbed the 'practitioner teacher model,' in that all aspects of the university were operated by the full-time practitioners - clinicians and administrators - who ran the medical center.
Features.
Several features differentiate practitioner-teacher model programs from more traditional, academically-based universities:
Graduates of practitioner-teacher programs are also far more likely to enter into applied and/or clinical settings upon graduation, rather than continuing on into theoretical or research-oriented programs.

Corporate Cannibal

"Corporate Cannibal" is a single by Grace Jones, released in 2008.
Background.
"Corporate Cannibal", written by Grace Jones, Ivor Guest, Adam Green and Marc van Eyck, is a trip hop song incorporating rock and electronic elements, and lyrically exploiting the issue of corporate capitalism. Explaining what led her to write "Corporate Cannibal", Jones said that she was "very obsessed with the subject" and penned the lyrics with Marc van Eyck. The song received flattering reviews from a number of independent blogs, having been described by them as "quite relevant to the times we live in now, with the whole occupy movement and corporate greed" and that it "pretty much sums up the scene in America that has defined our era".
Originally planned to be the title track of the new album, whose title was later changed to "Hurricane", the song eventually became its lead single. 12" vinyl pressings of "Corporate Cannibal" were released in a limited number as well as a promo-only CD. Commercially, the single was primarily available as a digital download. The song was remixed by Atticus Ross and Kevin "The Bug" Martin, among others.
Music video.
The "Corporate Cannibal" video was directed by photographer and director Nick Hooker. It was shot in black and white, with the only images appearing being Grace Jones' face and upper body shots, digitally distorted, as shown on the single cover. The video premiered at the Meltdown festival in June 2008 and was then uploaded onto YouTube on July 4, 2008, attracting 144,000 views by the time the download single was released late August.

Tom Barry (Cork hurler)

Tom Barry was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Carrigtwohill and with the Cork senior inter-county team in the 1920s and 1930s.
Playing career.
Club.
Barry played his club hurling with his local club in Carrigtwohill club and enjoyed some success. In spite of this he never won a senior county title with the club.
Inter-county.
Barry first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Cork in the late 1920s. He made his debut in 1928 as Cork faced Clare in the Munster final for the second year in-a-row. That game ended in a draw, however, in the replay Cork triumphed with Barry collecting his first Munster title. Cork later defeated Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the championship decider. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, however, the game turned into a rout. A score line of 6-12 to 1-0 gave Cork the victory and gave Barry a coveted All-Ireland medal.
In 1929 Cork retained their provincial dominance for a fourth consecutive year. A 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford gave Barry his second Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year’s game as Cork played Galway once again. Mick Ahern scored a goal for Cork after just 25 seconds to start another rout. Cork won the day by 4-9 to 1-3 giving Barry his second All-Ireland title.
In 1930 Barry added a National Hurling League title to his collection; however, Cork surrendered their provincial crown later that summer. The team bounced back in 1931 with Barry collecting a third Munster winners’ medal. Once again it took a replay for Cork and Waterford to be separated. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the first time since 1926. After a close game both sides finished level – 1-6 apiece. Eudie Coughlan played a captain’s role in that game as he scored a point from his knees to level the scores. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back. Once again both sides finished level – 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, this was rejected. It was also suggested at a meeting of the GAA’s Central Council that both counties be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. At the third attempt Cork triumphed by 5-8 to 3-4 giving Barry his third and final All-Ireland medal.

10 cm Nebelwerfer 40

The 10 cm Nebelwerfer 40 (10 cm NbW 40) was a heavy mortar used by Germany during the Second World War. Much like the American M2 4.2 inch mortar it was intended to deliver chemical munitions, such as gas and smoke shells, as well as ordinary high-explosive shells. It was derived from Rheinmetall's Nebelwerfer 51 and 52 prototypes of the late Thirties which were attempts to develop a more accurate and longer-ranged mortar than the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35. The NbW 40 is one of the better examples of German over-engineering since it fired a slightly heavier bomb over twice as far as the NbW 35, but weighed almost eight times more than the earlier model.
It was an innovative breech-loading design with the wheels permanently attached to the carriage, from which it was fired, and which wasn't disassembled for transport. It replaced the NbW 35 in ( "smoke or fog-thrower") battalions belonging to the Chemical Corps of the Heer; exactly how the American fielded their own M2s in chemical mortar battalions. It was replaced by the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 multiple rocket launcher from 1941.
Operational use.
They began to replace the "10 cm Nebelwerfer 35" mortars from late 1941 in the "Nebelwerfer" battalions, and were used by "Gebirgs-Werfer-Abteilung (Mountain Mortar Battalion) 10" plus the first battalion of the "Nebel-Lehr Regiment (Demonstration Regiment)" and saw service in the North Africa, Finland and Russia.

1991–92 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1991-92 campaign saw them finish 3rd, despite getting rid of Eoin Hand and replacing him with his assistant manager Ian Ross. Town missed out on promotion to Division 2, following their defeat to Peterborough United in the play-offs. 
Review.
With 3 years gone since Town's relegation from Division 2, some Town fans were beginning to wonder if Eoin Hand was going to get them promoted. Phil Starbuck was brought in from Nottingham Forest and he helped bring in the goals along with Iffy Onuora and Iwan Roberts. Town made a fairly good start to the season, with only one loss in their first 9 games. Form was intermittent with losses and wins more often than not. They were still hunting for an automatic promotion or a play-off place.
After Christmas, Town's form gradually got worse, with a run of only 2 wins in 12, which saw Eoin Hand given the sack on March 6. His assistant Ian Ross replaced him immediately and after a win against Shrewsbury Town, Town lost 3 games in a row, but they then won 7 out of their last 8 games, which gave them 3rd place in the table, so they had a two-legged play-off match against Peterborough United.
In the first leg at London Road, Town got a very respectable 2-2 draw, which seemed to suggest that Town's chances of progressing to the final to play Stockport County. Town took an early lead at Leeds Road thanks to a goal from Phil Starbuck, but Peterborough got 2 late goals to send them through to the final at Wembley, where they beat Stockport and got promotion to the newly created Division 1. So, because of the formation of the new Premier League, Town actually did play in Division 2 the next season.

Unfortunately, Shakthi Chidambaram finds himself on the wrong side of the line this time". Rediff wrote:"For sheer, mind-numbing crudity, there's no equal to Rajadhi Raja". Sify wrote:"Sakthi Chidambaram’s Rajadhi Raja is the crudest masala movie seen in recent times".

<doc id="18231573" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18231573" title="Grace Mugabe">
Grace Mugabe

Grace Mugabe (née Marufu), (born 23 July 1965), is the second wife of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and the First Lady of Zimbabwe from her marriage to the leader in 1996.
Grace was previously married to Stanley Goreraza, an air force pilot, and now working in the Zimbabwe embassy in China. As secretary to the president, she became his mistress while still married to Goreraza and together they had two children, Bona, named after Mugabe's mother, and Robert Peter, Jr. The couple were married in an extravagant Catholic Mass, titled the "Wedding of the Century" by the Zimbabwe press, after the death of Mr. Mugabe's first wife, Sally Hayfron.
In 1997, Grace Mugabe gave birth to the couple's third child, Chatunga. Grace is popularly known in Zimbabwe as "Dis Grace", a reference to her extravagant life-style while maintaining political responsibilities as first lady.
Sanctions.
After observers from the European Union were barred from examining Zimbabwe's 2002 elections, the EU imposed sanctions on 20 members of the Zimbabwe leadership and then, in July, extended them to include Mrs Mugabe and 51 others, banning them from travelling to participating countries and freezing any assets held there. The United States instituted similar restrictions.
Controversies.
Real estate.
During her tenure as first lady, Grace Mugabe has overseen the construction of two palaces. The first, referred to commonly as "Gracelands", became controversial for its extravagance, and Grace Mugabe later explained that she had paid for its construction with her own personal savings It has since been sold to Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. The second, completed in 2007, was reported to have cost $26 million to construct and to have been funded by the ZANU-PF party as thanks for Robert Mugabe's political service.
In 2002, Grace Mugabe toured farm properties in Zimbabwe, looking for a new location for herself and her family. She chose the Iron Mask Estate, which had been previously owned by farmers John and Eva Matthews.
The first family owns property in Malaysia, and in early 2008, it was reported that Grace Mugabe hoped to move there with her children. The intention behind the move was to escape the stress of leadership and to address fears that the first family faces assassination.
Recent reports indicate that Grace acquired property holdings in Hong Kong, including a diamond cutting business and a bolt-hole at House Number Three, JC Castle, 18 Shan Tong Road, Tai Po, Hong Kong. The media speculates that this property acquisition is intended as both a weekend getaway pad for their daughter Bona who is studying at the University of Hong Kong under an assumed name and that she and her husband expect to escape to China should they be ousted from power in Zimbabwe.
Diamond trade allegations and lawsuit.
In December 2010 US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks brought up again earlier allegations that high-ranking Zimbabwean government officials and well-connected elites, including Mugabe's wife Grace, are generating millions of dollars in personal income by hiring teams of diggers to hand-extract diamonds from the Chiadzwa mine in eastern Zimbabwe. Grace Mugabe is currently suing a Zimbabwean newspaper over its reporting of claims released by Wikileaks she had made "tremendous profits" from the country's diamond mines. The president's wife is demanding $15m (£9.6m) from the Standard newspaper.
Shopping.
Grace Mugabe is known for her lavish lifestyle. The "Daily Telegraph" called her "notorious at home for her profligacy" in a 2003 coverage of a trip to Paris, during which she was reported as spending £75,000 (approx US$120,000) in a short shopping spree; and over the past years leading to 2004 has withdrawn over £5 million from the Central Bank of Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe she is known sarcastically as "Gucci Grace" or "The First Shopper" in reference to her numerous, lavish European shopping sprees. When Grace Mugabe was included in the 2002 sanctions, one EU parliamentarian said that the ban would "stop Grace Mugabe going on her shopping trips in the face of catastrophic poverty blighting the people of Zimbabwe." Mrs Mugabe faces similar sanctions in the United States.
Assault on photographer.
"The Times" reported on 18 January 2009 that, while on a shopping trip in Hong Kong, where her daughter Bona Mugabe is a university student, Mrs Mugabe ordered her bodyguard to assault a "Times" photographer Richard Jones outside her luxury hotel. She then joined in the attack, punching Jones repeatedly in the face while wearing diamond encrusted rings, causing him cuts and abrasions. She was subsequently granted immunity from prosecution 'under Chinese diplomatic rules' because of her status as Mugabe's wife.
Daughter's controversies in Hong Kong.
Early reports indicated Bona Mugabe was a student at the University of Hong Kong. A protest started on the University of Zimbabwe campus on 3 February resulting in about 30 students needing medical treatment including police forces being used against defenseless citizens and harassments of students. Zimbabwe students were protesting to the P. R. Chinese embassy that Bona Mugabe should return home to Zimbabwe and study in the same conditions as her peers. Colleges and universities in Zimbabwe have failed to open since 2008 due to dollarization of fees and other economic problems.
On 17 February the University of Hong Kong distanced itself from the controversy, denying a report that she was a student there. The school statement said "We do not have a student by the name of Bona Mugabe on our student register, and we do not have any lady student from Zimbabwe who is reading for an undergraduate programme or is at the age of around 20." Subsequent reports clarified that Bona is in fact enrolled in a second school, the City University of Hong Kong, which said she met normal admission requirements and her enrolment was not influenced by her parentage. Due to the attention surrounding Robert Mugabe's daughters her family enlisted the help of a female ex-government official to provide safety and supervision during her time in Hong Kong.
According to Vice chairperson of the HK democratic party Emily Lau said the government should study whether to follow international practice in barring certain foreign politicians as many people might be looking at buying properties, investments or education in Hong Kong. Lee Wing-tat said Beijing should be making the decision since this was a foreign affair. Spokesperson Jiang Yu from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China said she was not aware of the Mugabes' alleged house purchase in Hong Kong and would not comment further. A professor at the University of HK said Beijing was trying to stay out of the controversy. The Beijing central government dismissed the concerns, adding that Falun Gong members were allowed to buy properties in Hong Kong.

Woody Gelman

Woodrow Gelman (1915 – February 9, 1978), better known as Woody Gelman, was a publisher, cartoonist, novelist and an artist-writer for both animation and comic books. As the publisher of Nostalgia Press, he pioneered the reprinting of vintage comic strips in quality hardcovers and trade paperbacks. As an editor and art director for two-and-a-half decades at Topps Chewing Gum, he introduced many innovations in trading cards and humor products. 
Gelman was the co-creator of Popsicle Pete and the co-creator of Bazooka Joe for Topps. He was also a co-creator of "Mars Attacks", adapted into the 1996 movie by Tim Burton.
Born in Brooklyn, Gelman attended City College of New York, Cooper Union and Pratt Institute before signing on as an assistant animator, in-betweener and scripter with Max Fleischer's studio in 1939, continuing to write for Famous Studios in 1946.
Comic books and advertising.
Gelman was the creator and writer of "The Dodo and the Frog" series for DC Comics. His comic book work from 1944 to 1954 included "Nutsy Squirrel" and other funny animal comic books of the 1940s, notably "Funny Stuff" and "Comic Cavalcade". He also wrote and drew the crime story, "The Kid from Brooklyn!", for "Heroic Comics" #32 (September 1945). 
In 1945, Gelman teamed with Ben Solomon to form a New York advertising art service, Solomon & Gelman, to create advertising campaigns involving cartoon characters, such as their "Popsicle Pete" magazine and ads for the Popsicle company. Topps writer-editor Len Brown recalled how the partnership led to Solomon and Gelman to sign on full time with Topps:
Topps.
In the autumn of 1951, Gelman and Sy Berger, then a 28-year-old World War II veteran, designed the 1952 Topps baseball card set on the kitchen table of Berger's apartment on Alabama Avenue in the Broadway Junction (Brooklyn) section of Brooklyn.
From 1953 to the late 1970s, Gelman headed Topps's Product Development Department, working with a staff that included associate creative director Len Brown, gagwriter Stan Hart, visual concept creator Larry Reilly, writer-cartoonists Art Spiegelman and Bhob Stewart, and designer-cartoonist Rick Varesi. Gelman assigned work to numerous freelance cartoonists, including Jack Davis, Mort Drucker, Jay Lynch, Bob Powell, John Severin, Tom Sutton, Basil Wolverton and Wally Wood. Beginning in 1967, Gelman supervised "Wacky Packages", one of the biggest fads of the 1970s, and he was responsible for devising many other Topps cards, stickers, posters and humor products over decades.
Triple Nickel Books.
In 1955, the firm of Solomon & Gelman published a series of 64-page juvenile novelettes. Because they retailed for 15 cents, the line was called Triple Nickel Books. The first Triple Nickel Book was very successful, as it was based on the life of Davy Crockett when Crockett was a national fad. At the same time, they published two other Triple Nickel Books about the adventures of the Power Boys, juvenile fiction in the tradition of the Hardy Boys. At least eight Power Boys adventures were published under the pseudonym Arthur Benwood, a name created by combining the first names of Ben Solomon and Woody Gelman. The line includes "The Secret of Crazy Cavern" (1955), "Riddle of the Sunken Ship" (1955), "Castle of Curious Creatures" (1956) and "Mystery of the Marble Face" (1956). These books are included in the University of South Florida's Special Collections: Tampa Children's Literature Collection. (The Triple Nickel titles are apparently unrelated to Mel Lyle's later and slightly better-known Power Boys series from the mid-1960s.)
Nostalgia Press.
After doing a facsimile reprint of the 1945 "Little Nemo in Slumberland" softcover, with an August Derleth introduction, Gelman began Nostalgia Press in the early 1960s. One of the earliest Nostalgia Press books was "The Picture History of Charlie Chaplin" (1965), designed by Gelman and showcasing a large collection of rare Chaplin memorabilia. In 1960, he was an associate editor of "The American Card Catalog". 
The first Nostalgia Press hardcover was "Flash Gordon" (1967), a reprint of Alex Raymond comic strips, and this book had a follow-up utilizing "Flash Gordon" proof sheets supplied to Gelman by the artist Al Williamson. Two years later, he compiled art by Charles Dana Gibson for "The Best of Charles Dana Gibson" (Bounty Books, 1969), with accompanying biographical material and an introduction by Gelman. Bill Gaines and Bhob Stewart selected 23 stories for the full-color "EC Horror Comics Library of the 1950s"; with introductions by Stewart and Larry Stark, this oversize (10" x 14") hardcover was published by Nostalgia Press in 1971.
In 1973, Gelman published a collection of "Little Nemo" strips, first published in Italy. Gelman discovered original strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son worked in 1966. Many of the original drawings that Gelman recovered were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor.
In the 1970s, Gelman did two collections of "Scorchy Smith", and he moved into yet another area, publishing a magazine, "Nostalgia", mainly devoted to reprints of comic strips. The first issue of his earlier magazine, "Nostalgia Illustrated", was completed in 1967 as a dummy but was never published. Instead, Gelman sold the title and some material to Magazine Management, which did at least a dozen nationally distributed issues in the early 1970s. During the 1970s, he also published his "Golden Age of the Comics" series, reprinting such strips as "Mandrake the Magician", "Terry and the Pirates" and "Thimble Theatre". 
Other work by Gelman appears in "Wacky Packages", published by Abrams in 2008.
Films.
Robert Altman's live-action film "Popeye" (1980) is adapted from E. C. Segar's "Thimble Theatre" comic strip. The screenplay by Jules Feiffer was based directly on "Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye the Sailor", a hardcover reprint collection of 1936-37 Segar strips published in 1971 by Nostalgia Press.
Tim Burton's film "Mars Attacks" (1996) was adapted from Topps 1962 "Mars Attacks" trading card series written by Gelman and Len Brown and illustrated by Wally Wood, Bob Powell and Norman Saunders.
Awards.
In 1971, he was honored by the Academy of Comic Book Arts with Recognition for Preservation and Popularization of Comic Art.
Gelman, who lived in Malverne, Long Island, maintained a collection of rare American and European periodicals dating back to the 19th century. He died February 9, 1978 of a stroke at Franklin General Hospital, Valley Stream, Long Island. His niece Susan Gelman and nephew Andrew Gelman are prominent academics.

Dough Boys (film)

Dough Boys is a 2009 drama film written and produced by Preston A. Whitmore II and directed by Nicholas Harvell.
Plot.
1100 Jefferson Street is not just any address; it’s the Mecca for four friends bonded by both their circumstances and their struggle to make something, anything out of their seemingly predetermined fate.
The crew played by Arlen Escarpeta, Cory Hardrict, Maurice McRae and Lorenzo Eduardo share one simple job description -- “Dough Boys.”
Corey, the all-around good guy with great potential (Escarpeta); Smooth, the ladies man, big dreamer and quintessential leader (Hardrict); Black, the eager-to-please skinny weed head (McRae) and Long Cuz, the skittishly annoying square trying to keep up with everyone else (Eduardo) form the group who make up their rules and moves as they go along.
Drama can always be found among 1100 Jefferson Street’s day-to-day dealings down to the resident crack head that serves as both lookout and snitch and the good-hearted Beauty (Reagan Gomez-Preston) running a full-service hair salon out of her one-bedroom apartment.
Meanwhile, Corey plays a balancing act with the streets and his future as he weighs the arguments of his girlfriend in one ear and mentor, Simuel – played by Gabriel Casseus – in the other to go back to school.
But constantly calling Corey’s attention are the “Dough Boys,” who dream big enough to spend their money before they get it and smoke their joints before they roll ‘em.
Although they shy clear of the drug game, the boys still do their streetwise duty in protecting the resident drug dealer in the building, played by Kirk Jones a.k.a. Sticky Fingaz. This is a loyal bond that pays off well. But their current “hustle” of choice is flipping counterfeit casino chips in a limited market.
The young men have obviously bit off more than they can chew and when their buyer Julian France, played by Wood Harris walks in it gets really interesting. Thus, the “Dough Boys” fight to stay alive as the rules of the street that they live by consequentially are the very rules that begin to pull them under.
The film also features performances by Ricky Harris, Kel Mitchell and Page Kennedy.
For anyone who hustled for more in life comes “Dough Boys” produced and written by writer/director/producer Preston A. Whitmore II.
“Dough Boys” – which is the first full-length feature film from director Nicholas Harvell – is the inaugural feature from Whitmore’s “Give Back” program, where he funds independent films to give up and coming directors, actors and other filmmakers a shot at utilizing their skills. Bonnie Berry LaMon serves as Executive Producer.

The Macau Baptist Convention (Abbr: MBC) is a cooperative association of Baptist churches in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. It was until very recently known as the Macau Baptist Association ().
It can trace its origins to the work established by the Triennial Convention missionaries, John and Henrietta Shuck, in 1835. The first Baptist church was, however, only set up in 1905 when the Macau Baptist Church was planted by Charlton Todd. A building was purchased in 1927 at the Rua Pedro Nolasco da Silva to house its congregation and is today also the headquarters of the MBC.

Ernesto Nicolini

Ernesto Nicolini (February 23, 1834 - January 19, 1898) was a French operatic tenor, particularly associated with the French and Italian repertories.
Born Ernest Nicolas in Saint Malo, France, he studied at the Paris Conservatory and made his debut in 1857, at the Opéra-Comique in Halevy's "Les mousquetaires de la reine". After further study in Italy, he made his debut at La Scala in Milan in 1859, under the name Ernesto Nicolini, as Alfredo in "La traviata", other roles there included Rodrigo in Rossini's "Otello", and Elvino in Bellini's "La sonnambula". 
On his return to France he sang at the Théâtre-Italien from 1862 until 1869. He made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London in 1866, as Edgardo in "Lucia di Lammermoor", without great success due to the pronounced vibrato that marred his singing.
Five years later he returned to London to sing in "Faust" and "Robert le diable" at Drury Lane, and from 1872 appeared every season at the Royal Opera House until 1884; his roles there included Pery in "Il Guarany", Radames in "Aida", and the title role in "Lohengrin". He created the role of Celio at the premiere of Charles Lenepveu's "Velléda" in 1882. 
During the season 1874-75, he appeared in St Petersburg and Moscow, opposite the world-famous soprano Adelina Patti, whom he would partner in almost all her appearances thereafter, accompanying her on concert tours of the major western European capitals (Vienna, Milan, Venice, Brussels, Berlin and so on), as well on tours of the United States and South America. 
While together in Paris in 1886, singing in "Faust" at the Grand Opéra, the two created something of a scandal by getting married; Patti had divorced her first husband, the Marquis de Caux, shortly before her wedding to Nicolini.
Nicolini appeared on stage for the last time at Drury Lane in 1897, as Almaviva in "Il barbiere di Siviglia". He died the following year in Pau, France.
Additional information.
The Welsh opera singer and voice-over actress Lisa Lee Dark is Nicolini's 4th great-grand niece.

Castleton, Utah

Castleton is a ghost town located on the La Sal Mountain Loop Road some northeast of Moab in Grand County, Utah, United States. The nearest inhabited town is Castle Valley.
History.
A short-lived gold placer mining camp existed here in the 1860s, but the area was first settled by a prospector named Doby Brown in the late 1870s or early 1880s. By 1882 enough settlers had gathered to establish a post office. In 1888 when a local gold rush began at nearby Miners Basin, Castleton became important as a supply town. It had a general store, hotel, two saloons, and several other businesses. At its peak in 1895, the population exceeded that of Moab. In fact, when Grand County was organized in 1890, Castleton vied with Moab for the chance to be county seat.
The Panic of 1907 closed down the area's mines, and soon ranchers were Castleton's only residents. By 1910 the businesses were gone, leaving only the post office, and the population had dropped to 50. In 1930 there were six residents. A few people stayed in the dead town for decades, but in 1967 the county commission officially vacated Castleton as an occupied town.

<doc id="18232185" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18232185" title="Long Branch, Toronto">
Long Branch, Toronto

Long Branch is a neighbourhood and former municipality in the south-west of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the south-west corner of the former Township (and later, City) of Etobicoke on the shore of Lake Ontario. The village of Long Branch was a partially independent municipality from 1930 to 1967. Long Branch is located within a land grant from the government to Colonel Samuel Smith in the late 18th Century. After Smith's death, a small portion of it was developed as a summer resort in the late 1800s.
Character.
Long Branch is primarily a residential district, composed mostly of single-family, detached homes. Along Lake Shore Boulevard West, numerous business are located in a low-rise commercial strip. South of Lake Shore Boulevard West, the area of single-family homes extends down to the lake. The area's lake shore is primarily privately owned, except for Long Branch Park and Marie Curtis Park.
Long Branch's population in 2011 was 9,625, a decline from 10,365 in 2001. The population has a higher proportion of working-age persons and lower proportions of children and seniors compared to the City of Toronto average. 65% of Long Branch persons indicate English as their mother tongue, with 31% having neither English or French to be the mother tongue of the household. The largest non-official language mother tongue is Polish at 6.3%, or 605 persons.
Boundaries.
Long Branch is bounded by Lake Ontario on the south, with western boundaries of Etobicoke Creek north of Lake Shore Blvd. West and the western property line of the Canadian Arsenals Ltd. (Small Arms Ltd., WWII) (now within Marie Curtis Park) south of Lakeshore Road in Mississauga, Region of Peel. The district is bounded by the Canadian National Railway's mainline to the north, and the eastern boundaries being Twenty-Third Street south of Lake Shore Blvd. West, and the midpoint between Twenty-Second and Twenty-Fourth Streets north of Lake Shore Blvd. West. 
History.
Before Long Branch became a village, it was the home to Loyalist Col. Sam Smith, who was one of the earliest settlers in Etobicoke. His cabin was located near Etobicoke Creek and survived into the 1950s. Col. Smith was granted a large tract of land for his service in the Queen's Rifles in 1797, which eventually extended from what is now Kipling Avenue to the original course of the Etobicoke River (now Creek), and south of Bloor Street to Lake Ontario after Col. Smith acquired additional parcels of land. The southern portion of this tract would include all of Long Branch and the westernmost portion of New Toronto, south of the railway line.
The property was bought by James Eastwood from Col. Sam Smith's son, Samuel Bois Smith, in 1871. In 1883 Eastwood sold a portion of his land south of Lake Shore Road (now, Boulevard West) to a small group of financiers from Toronto. It was to be developed as a summer resort called 'Sea Breeze Park', and a plan of subdivision was filed in 1884. In 1886, the site was acquired by Thomas Wilkie and his brother and it was renamed 'Long Branch Park', after the seaside summer resort area of Long Branch, New Jersey where Thomas had vacationed. The central north–south street was originally named 'Sea Breeze Avenue', but was renamed as 'Long Branch Avenue'.
In 1887, the 'Long Branch Hotel' was built, set back from the waterfront near Beach Road (now Lake Promenade) and Long Branch Avenue. It survived until 1958, when it was destroyed by fire. In 1891, the Long Branch post office was opened to serve the Long Branch Park summer resort. Beginning in 1910, other lots south of Lake Shore Road around Long Branch Park began to be subdivided. In the 1920s, the land surrounding the mouth of Etobicoke Creek, known as the "Etobicoke Flats", was sub-divided for cottages and housing.
In 1895, the Toronto & Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company radial railway's single-track service was completed along Lake Shore Road from New Toronto through Long Branch to the current location of Long Branch Loop. In 1927, this line was amalgamated by the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) and double-tracked in 1928.
In 1915, the Long Branch Aerodrome was established to the west of the village in Toronto Township, today's Mississauga. The aerodrome was Canada's first and was operated by the Curtiss Flying School until 1917.
The Village of Long Branch was incorporated in 1930, after the other lake shore municipalities of Mimico (1917) and New Toronto (1920) were incorporated as towns. After the incorporation, some of its streets were given new names. In 1931, north–south street names were standardized by continuing the ordinal numbers of New Toronto's streets, picking-up at Twenty-Third Street in the east through to Forty-Third Street in the west. For example; Lansdowne Avenue became Thirty-Third Street and Lake View Avenue became Thirty-Fifth Street. Long Branch Avenue has remained the same (it could have been Thirty-Fourth St.). Thirty-Seventh St. was formerly called Robert Street, after Robert Eastwood. Today, a drugstore is located at the corner of Thirty-Seventh St. and Lake Shore Blvd. West on the site of the former Eastwood Park Hotel, which Robert Eastwood opened in 1910. Today, other local streets such as James Street still bear names of members of the Eastwood family. Twenty-third Street was called Government Road even after the 1931 incorporation. 
A cenotaph was raised on Long Branch Avenue south of Lake Shore in 1933 to commemorate the village's contributions during the First (and later, Second) World War. During the Second World War, many industries were opened between Lake Shore Road and the railway to the north as part of the Commonwealth war effort. The Small Arms Limited Long Branch Arsenal munitions factory was established during World War II to the west of the village, just north of the Aerodrome's location.
Hurricane Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto, as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm's unexpected retention of power. Hazel had traveled 1,100 km (680 mi) over land, but while approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (2009: $41.7 million) in aid.
In October 1954, more than forty homes in Long Branch were lost at the mouth of the Etobicoke Creek by Hurricane Hazel, which caused the largest flood experienced to date. Long Branch's dead from the hurricane were: Mr and Mrs Ed Crymble and their daughter Clifford; Patricia and Robert Thorpe; and Mrs. Thorpe's mother, Mrs. Robert Johnston. The Thorpe's baby daughter Nancy survived. The baby had been handed to 17-year-old Sylvia Jones while the area was being abandoned. Jones climbed onto a nearby roof and the two were later saved by fire fighters. The Thorpe's house was one of the ones washed away into Lake Ontario. Nancy Thorpe was later adopted by her aunt and uncle. The O'Farrell family escaped when their house was floated down the river, by climbing onto trees that their house crashed into. 35 persons survived on the roof of one house that was held back from Lake Ontario by two trees the house had crashed into. According to Long Branch Reeve Marie Curtis, "if it hadn't been for the trees, which held the houses back, half of them would have been swept out into the lake." 147 cottages at the mouth were declared unfit for habitation after the flooding when sanitation facilities broke down.
To prevent any future floods from having similar disastrous results, cottages and houses from the floodplain, the sand bar and around the mouth of the river were removed and the area was turned into parkland. In 1959, the park was named for village Reeve Marie Curtis in recognition for her longstanding municipal service and her efforts to have the park built. A trailer park north of Lakeshore Road, Pleasant Valley Trailer Park, was also destroyed when flooding caused a dike to break. The trailer park is now the site of Maurice J. Breen Park. 
Forty-Third Street, along the eastern bank of Etobicoke Creek, was closed up and only a stub north of Lake Shore Boulevard exists. West of Etobicoke Creek and south of Lakeshore Road is Island Road, which today is an access road for parking and a boat launch for Marie Curtis Park. It was built in the early 20th century to serve the sub-division built on the banks of the Etobicoke Creek and an island within the channel of the creek. As part of the park development, the island of Island Road became part of the west bank of Etobicoke Creek, as the western channel was filled in. At the same time, a sand bar at the mouth was connected to shore by fill. The sand bar is Marie Curtis Beach today. Etobicoke Creek originally turned at a right-angle to the west at the shore, but now is channeled straight out to the lake. A new section of Island Road was built to connect to Lakeshore Road to the north, as its prior connection to Forty-Third Street on the eastern bank was closed.
After World War II, an influx of immigrants from Europe came to Toronto. One of the largest Orthodox churches in Canada, St. Demetrius Ukrainian Orthodox Church (not to be confused with St Demetrius Byzantine Rite Catholic church, also in Etobicoke), was built on Lake Shore Road (now Blvd. West) opposite 27th Street in 1958.
In 1967, the Village of Long Branch along with the Towns of New Toronto and Mimico were amalgamated with the Township of Etobicoke to form the Borough of Etobicoke. That year, the new GO Transit commuter train service was established and the Long Branch GO Station was built next to Long Branch Loop, connecting Long Branch west to Oakville and east to downtown Toronto. 
The Borough became the City of Etobicoke in 1984. In 1998, Etobicoke was merged with five other municipalities and the Metropolitan Toronto government to form the new City of Toronto.
In the 1990s, areas of industry started to relocate out of Long Branch. Lake Shore Boulevard West today is a major thoroughfare and business strip in transition, with plans, some controversial, to change its character from a low-density industrial-commercial corridor to higher-density residential uses including some limited commercial space.
Transportation.
The Long Branch Loop is the western terminus for the 501 Queen and 508 Lake Shore TTC streetcar lines, connecting Long Branch to downtown Toronto. The Loop is also the terminus for the "110 Islington South" and "123 Shorncliffe" TTC bus lines. The MiWay Mississauga transit agency operates the 5 Dixie and 23 Lakeshore from the Loop west into Mississauga. Next to the loop is the Long Branch GO Station on the GO Transit Lakeshore West line.
The major east–west arterial road in Long Branch is Lake Shore Boulevard, which connects to the east to downtown Toronto. Lake Shore Boulevard West continues to the west as Lakeshore Road in Mississauga. The main north–south arterial road is Brown's Line which connects to the Gardiner Expressway, Ontario Highway 427 and the Queen Elizabeth Way highways to the north.
Historical sites.
These sites are located on the former Federal Government lands, located south of Lakeview and west of Long Branch, in Mississauga.
Small Arms Limited, Long Branch Arsenal.
Adjacent to the western boundary of Marie Curtis Park (now Marie Curtis Park West) in Toronto Township is the former site of the Small Arms Limited Long Branch Arsenal. The Federal Government had owned the lands south of Lake Shore Road, between the Etobicoke River to just west of Cawthra Road, from the late 1800s into the early 20th-Century.
The Ordnance Branch of the Department of National Defense authorized the construction of the factory in 1940. After transfer to the Department of Munitions and Supply, a Crown Corporation, Small Arms Ltd. was formed to operate the facility. By June 1941, the first five rifles had been produced. Huge quantities of British-pattern military small arms were manufactured there during the Second World War, including the No.4 MkI* Lee-Enfield bolt-action rifle, and the Sten submachine-gun (or machine-carbine). Small Arms Ltd. ceased operations at the end of December 1945. Beginning January 1, 1946, operations continued as the Small Arms Division, Canadian Arsenals Limited. The factory was closed June 30, 1976. The property was later used by Canada Post as a distribution centre.
The factory complex was demolished and the "Arsenal Lands" are now slated to become part of Marie Curtis Park West. The buildings of the office complex at the foot of Dixie Road have been saved for public use, while only the water tower remains from the factory complex.
Long Branch Aerodrome.
The Long Branch Aerodrome was located west of Long Branch on the Federal Government lands in Toronto Township (today's Mississauga). The aerodrome was situated on a 100-acre property on Lakeshore Road just west of Dixie Road. The Long Branch Aerodrome has the distinction of being the first Aerodrome in Canada and home to Canada's first aviator training school. It opened on May 20, 1915, by Curtiss Aeroplanes and Motors Company for the Royal Flying Corps. Aircraft such as the Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" soon became a common sight at the airfield, which included three aircraft hangars.
In January 1917, the newly designated Royal Flying Corps, Canada, the forerunner to the Royal Canadian Air Force, opened the RFC Training Centre at Long Branch. The Long Branch training centre also provided instruction on flying boats at nearby Hanlon's Point in Toronto Harbour, the first seaplane base in Canada. By July 1917, the flight school re-located to the Armour Heights Aerodrome. Long Branch became the Cadet Ground Training School for the Royal Flying Corps. Both the school and the aerodrome closed in 1919. During World War II, the former aerodrome served initially as 21 Non-permanent Active Militia Training centre and then as an army small arms training centre. After the war, the Lakeview Armoury was established on the site, but was demolished in he 1950s. 
Not the slightest trace remains of the airfield today. From 1962 to 2005, the waterfront portion of the property was the location of Ontario Power Generation's Lakeview Generating Station. In September 1969, a plaque was erected at the site to commemorate Canada's first Aerodrome.

Total return

The total return on a portfolio of investments takes into account not only the capital appreciation on the portfolio, but also the income received on the portfolio. The income typically consists of interest, dividends, and securities lending fees. This contrasts with the price return, which takes into account only the capital gain on an investment.
Stock and bond funds provide annual Total Return values summarizing the last ten years of operation. Total Return assumes that dividends are reinvested in the funds. 
A reasonably accurate equation for the percent Total Return in a year of any security is the sum of the percent gain (or loss, a negative percent) over the year in the security value, plus the annual dividend yield expressed as a percent (100 × annual dividends divided by the security price at the beginning of the year). This slightly understates the Total Return because it ignores the reinvestment of dividends, as soon as they are paid, for purchasing more of the security.

Over the years USBA expanded to offer those same insurance products and services to active reserves, National Guard, Federal Employees, honorably discharged veterans, and others.
Board of Directors.
USBA is governed by a Board of Directors elected annually by the membership. The Board is composed of active and retired military members and Federal employees. Board members typically serve a three year term.

<doc id="18232390" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18232390" title="Danake">
Danake

The danake or danace (Greek: ) was a small silver coin of the Persian Empire (Old Persian "dânake"), equivalent to the Greek obol and circulated among the eastern Greeks. Later it was used by the Greeks in other metals. The 2nd-century grammarian Julius Pollux gives the name as "danikê" or "danakê" or "danikon" and says that it was a Persian coin, but by Pollux's time this was an anachronism.
The term as used by archaeologists is vague in regard to denomination. A single coin buried with the dead and made of silver or gold is often referred to as a danake and presumed to be a form of Charon's obol. Numismatists have also found the danake an elusive coin to identify, speculating that the Greeks used the term loosely for a demonetized coin of foreign origin.
In Persia, the danake was originally a unit of weight for bulk silver, representing one-eighth of a shekel (1.05 gm). This use of the word became obsolete. In the Hellenistic period and later it designated the silver Attic obol, which originally represented the sixth part of a drachma; in New Persian "dâng" means "one sixth".
Customary use.
The danake is one of the coins that served as the so-called Charon's obol, which was placed on or in a dead person's mouth to pay the ferryman who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. Charon's obol is sometimes specifically called a "naulum" (Greek , "boat fare"). The Christian-era lexicographer Hesychius gives "the obol for the dead" as one of the meanings of , and the Suidas defines the danake as a coin traditionally buried with the dead for paying the ferryman to cross the Acheron. In literary sources, the smallness of the denomination was taken as a reminder that death is an equalizer of rich and poor.
Although Charon's obol is usually regarded as Hellenic, archaeology indicates that the rite of placing of a coin in the mouth of the deceased was practiced also during Parthian and even Sasanian times in the region that is present-day Iran. The coin, however, was customarily a drachma. In his entry on the , Hesychius implies that the coin was mentioned by Heracleides of Cyme in his lost work "Persica" around 350 B.C., placing its use (perhaps erroneously) in the Achaemenid period.
Funerary context.
Gold danakes are frequently found in graves. In a Thessalian burial of the 4th century B.C., a gold danake had been placed on the lips of a woman, presumed from her religious paraphernalia to be an initiate into the Orphic or Dionysiac mysteries. The coin was stamped with a Gorgon's head.
In archaeological investigations of Greece since the mid-1990s, danakes have tended to be found in cemeteries. At a necropolis at Hephaisteia on Lemnos, exploration of which began in 1995, the many finds in unlooted graves included a gold danake. In the late 1990s, a cemetery in northwest Greece yielded objects dating from the mid-4th to the early 3rd centuries B.C., including oinochoai, unguentaria, a wreath with thin gold leaves (sometimes associated with Orphic religion), a gold danake, and a silver obol with a winged Pegasus. A gold danake of Geta dating 199–200 A.D. was among objects — including potsherds, animal bones and shells, and bronze coins —retrieved from a well in the center of a cemetery in central Macedonia. The well was surrounded by a paved floor and housed by a stone structure. It is thought that the deposition followed funerary meals and offerings to the dead.
In investigations reported 2004–2005, a single gold danake was found along with bronze coins and glassware in an Achaian cemetery where both adults and children had been buried in wooden coffins. Graves in Euboia yielded pottery and glassware, small bone tools, iron strigils, and gold jewelry and danakes. In Epiros, graves and funerary chests yielded gold danakes along with kantharoi, lamps, pyxides, figurines, gold rings, gold oak leaves, iron strigils, a bone flute, fragments of funerary stelae and a marble head of a young man. The items dated from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C. Excavations at a Hellenistic cemetery in the same area uncovered five gold danakes along with seventeen perfume flasks, twenty-six vessels, a bronze strigil, an iron spearhead, terracotta figurines and a funerary pelike with "gorgoneia" at the base of the handles.
Later use.
The word "danake" continued in use into the Middle Ages as Arabic "daneq", Persian "dangh" or "daneh", and post-classical Sanskrit "tanka". The name has been connected to the silver "tangka" of India, which had the same weight.

Stella Greenall

Stella Margaret Greenall (8 October 1926 – 18 June 2008), born Stella Draycott, was an education activist and adviser to the United Kingdom government. Between 1952 and 1975 she worked at the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom (NUS) and during this time was instrumental in the creation of a universal system of grants for higher education students in Britain.
Early life.
Born in Sheffield, and a pupil at High Storrs Grammar School for Girls, she attended St Hugh's College, Oxford.
Work with NUS.
Greenall was first involved with NUS as a student in the 1940s. She was then employed as a member of staff in 1952, and in her tenure there developed the union's education and welfare campaigns, especially around student finance. She was known as a formidable negotiator, and this culminated in the introduction, in 1962, of mandatory grants for all higher education students in the UK, a system which was in large part unchanged until the introduction of tuition fees in 1998.
Later life.
In 1975, Greenall was persuaded to leave NUS to work as an advisor to the then Labour Education Secretary, Fred Mulley. She also advised his successor, Shirley Williams, until the Conservative victory in the 1979 elections.
In 1998 she cancelled her standing order to the Labour Party as a result of their introduction of tuition fees.
Numismatic Interests.
After his death in 1991, Greenhall progressed her husband Philip's work on dividing 17th century tokens between London and Middlesex to publication in the British Numismatic Journal #61 from 1991. She also publicised with it a map in the London Topographical Society Newsletter of November 1993.
Greenhall presented their collection of 870 Venetian coins and 23 medals to the British Museum, a gift which was celebrated with the exhibition 'Venice Preserv'd' which ran from 9 November 1993 to 13 February 1994.
As recently as February 2008 Stella attended the launch of the publication of Norweb Tokens Part VII in Harrow, London. Previously she had published three valuable analyses of 17th century tokens by place and by date.
Greenall died of cancer on 18 June 2008.

Juan Silvano Godoi

Juan Bautista Gill (November 12, 1850 – January 1926) was a Paraguayan scholar.
Childhood and studies.
He was born in Asuncion on November 12, 1850. He was the son of the Colonel Juan Vicente Godoy and Petrona Echagüe. Narciso Echagüe y Andía, his mother’s father, was one of the leaders of the national independence. He was imprisoned during Francia’s dictatorship, and shot after twenty years in jail.
Juan Silvano studied in the Jesuit College of the Inmaculate Conception in the city of Santa Fe, Argentina. There, he was condisciple of José Zorrilla de San Martín. In the holydays of 1864, he spent some time in Asunción. Due to his short age and good luck, Francisco Solano López authorized him to continue his education in Argentina. This way, he escaped along with two of his brothers, the foulness of a war in which sixteen of the Echagüe family died. Some of the deceased were meritorious soldiers.
He entered the Buenos Aires School of Law, and stayed there during the whole war. In January 1869, once Asuncion was occupied, he interrupted his studies to move back to their land with a group of young fellow patriots. This was done as an attempt to help reconstruct the nation. In spite of his religious formation, Godoi had become a mason and a freethinker.
The post-war.
As a youngster Juan Silvano had begun replacing the “y” in his original surname (Godoy) for an “I”.
He was lucky enough to live through the dark postwar years in Paraguay. His strong and idealist personality forced him to get involved in the corrupt national politics. He did everything he could to help reconstruct a shattered country, but the politics scene was full of power disputes. Shortly he was known as one the main politicians in the scene. Many politicians were killed or exiled in their attempt to establish a national order.
During the time he spent in Paraguay after his return he knew many young national leaders. He was a co-founder of the Great Club of the People along with José Segundo Decoud, Facundo Machaín, Juan José Decoud, Cayo Miltos and Miguel Palacios. He witnessed how many of his previously mentioned fellows vanished.
He was elected as a conventional in the district of the Cathedral. He was a member of the commission that was in charge of redacting the Constitution of 1870. Once the triumvirate was dissolved because two of his members renounced, Cirilo Antonio Rivarola became the only ruler.
In that chaotic environment, an ambitious and conservative character emerged, Juan Bautista Gill.
After the killing of his brother Marcos, Juan Silvano declared himself an opponent of J. B. Gill. Since then, he became a part of a conspiracy to murder of Gill. The assassination occurred in the middle of the street, April 12, 1877.
Exile and return.
After the murder, Godoi lived long exile of eighteen-years in Buenos Aires. His enormous cultural background and well-known education, led him to meet most of the intellectuals of Argentina, like Aristóbulo Del Valle, Ramón Cárcano, Guido Spano, Mariano Pelliza and others.
During the government of Colonel Escurra, in 1895, he returned to Paraguay. He took his library of twenty thousand volumes along with him. He also took many of his famous paintings. In addition to this he offered the country two books of his own, as a display of patriotism in spite of his long absence.
In 1901, he became general director of the National Library, Museum and Archives.
He represented Paraguay in 1910, the century of Argentina’s independence, in the America’s Congress.
His books.
He wrote many books, and was a polemic journalist. In the writings he left, there is a very valuable legacy like: 
Godoi died in January 1926, in Asunción. The mother of his children was Bienvenida Rivarola.

Clifford "Cliff" Taylor was Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 2005 through 2009.
Taylor was appointed to the court in 1997 by then-Governor John Engler, ran for election to the balance of the appointed term in 1998 and was reelected in 2000. He was chosen by his fellow justices to be the Chief Justice twice, in 2005 and 2007. One of his opponents in 1998 was Matthew R. Abel, nominated by the Reform Party of Michigan. Abel used the campaign to protest Taylor's conflict of interest with his wife's position in the State Executive Branch as Legal Advisor to the Governor. Abel also demanded that Taylor resign.
Taylor is a graduate of the University of Michigan and The George Washington University, and lives near Lansing with his wife of 39 years, Lucille Taylor, and his two sons. While attending Michigan, he was initiated as a brother of Sigma Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He served as President of the Michigan Interfraternity Council in 1963, leading a landmark policy change which gave fraternities judicial autonomy from the University.
Wayne County Circuit Judge Diane Marie Hathaway defeated Justice Taylor in the 2008 Supreme Court election. The Michigan Campaign Finance Network estimates that over six million dollars were spent on the campaign, including so-called unregulated "issue ads."
Taylor's tenure was marked by complaints about conflicts of interest due to the campaign finance system.
After Taylor's defeat in the election, the Court chose the more liberal Marilyn Jean Kelly to succeed him as Chief Justice.

Edward Phelips (speaker)

Sir Edward Phelips (ca. 1555/601614) was an English lawyer and politician, the Speaker of the English House of Commons from 1604 until 1611, and subsequently Master of the Rolls from 1611 until his death in 1614. He was an elected MP from 1584, and in 1588, following a successful career as a lawyer, he commissioned Montacute House to be built as a home for himself and his family. He was knighted in 1603 and one of his major roles was as the opening prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters. 
He married Elizabeth Newdigate, and his son, Sir Robert Phelips, inherited his land and property.
Life.
He was fourth and youngest son of Thomas Phelips (1500–1588) of Montacute, Somerset, by his wife Elizabeth (d. 1598), daughter of John Smythe of Long Ashton in the same county. His father stood godfather to Thomas Coryate. Edward was born about 1560: according to Coryate, who refers to him as a patron, he was about 53 in 1613.
He joined the Middle Temple, where he was autumn reader in 1596. In 1601 he entered parliament as knight of the shire for Somerset. On 11 February 1603 he was named serjeant-at-law, but Queen Elizabeth died, and he did not proceed to his degree until the following reign. On 17 May he was made king's serjeant and knighted. In November he took part in the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh.He was re-elected to parliament for Somerset on 11 February 1604, and on 19 March was elected speaker. According to Sir Julius Cæsar, he was the best speaker for some decades, and though long-winded did expedite some business for the king.
On 17 July 1604 he was granted the office of justice of common pleas in the county palatine of Lancaster. In this capacity he was very active against Catholics; he is said to have declared that, as the law stood, all who were present when mass was celebrated were guilty of felony. He was one of those appointed to examine the Gunpowder Plot conspirators, and in January 1606 opened the indictment against Guy Fawkes. He was also chancellor to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. On 2 December 1608 he was granted the reversion of the mastership of the rolls, but did not succeed to the office until January 1611. On 14 July 1613 he was appointed ranger of all royal forests, parks, and chases in England.
Besides his house in Chancery Lane, and another at Wanstead, Essex, where he entertained the king, Phelips built a large mansion, Montacute House, which is still standing, and in the possession of his descendants. He died on 11 September 1614, having married, first, Margaret (d. 28 April 1590), daughter of Robert Newdegate of Newdegate, Surrey, by whom he had two sons, Sir Robert and Francis; secondly, Elizabeth (d. 26 March 1638), daughter of Thomas Pigott of Doddershall House, Buckinghamshire.

Price return

The price return is the rate of return on an investment portfolio, where the return measure takes into account only the capital appreciation of the portfolio, while the income generated by the assets in the portfolio, in the form of interest and dividends, is ignored. This contrasts with the total return, which does take into account the income generated in the portfolio.
Often, when the return of a stock market index is quoted in the press, the quoted returns concern price returns, rather than the total returns. Examples are the S&P 500 and the MSCI EAFE, which are typically quoted in terms of price return. This is clearly misleading, since, economically speaking, it is the total return that is the only thing that matters. Whether that return is generated in the form of cash income or in capital appreciation is irrelevant as long as one can always liquidate the investment to realise the capital appreciation into cash.
For the same reason, it is inappropriate to evaluate the skill of a portfolio manager by comparing the total return on the portfolio to the price return of an index. After all, the total return on the index will always exceed the price return on the same index, so the portfolio manager could simply outperform the price return of the index by investing in the index. Even so, the use of price indices is still quite common in the investment industry.

Georges Menahem

Georges Menahem is a French sociologist and economist whose work employs methods drawn from economics, sociology and statistics. He is a Research Director in the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). Previously, he had been a senior research fellow in the Institute for Research and Information in Health Economics (IRDES), a French research institute specializing in health economics and health statistics.
Scientific biography.
Georges Menahem began his university training at Grenoble University (France) where he graduated in mathematics and physics. After having performed his first experiments in the field of astrophysics (in Jodrell Bank Observatory and Nançay Decimetric Radio Telescope) and solid-state physics (in Grenoble University), his observations in social sciences led him to write his first book (1976) on the relationships between science and the military. In a subsequent shift in intellectual pursuits toward the social sciences, his research focused on the sociology of the labour knowledge and of the division of labour, on the sociology of the family, with the creation of a new typology of family organisation and an analysis of "The Economic Rationales Within the Family", a topic which became the title of his PhD in Economics.
In the 1990s, as a sociologist searching for root causes of family behaviours, he discovered significant correlation between risky behaviours, vulnerability to illness and grave childhood traumatic events, findings that he explored in greater depth, first with data from INSEE, then with IRDES data. As an economist, he tried also to explain these findings with concepts from health economics and risk economics. Since 2003 he has focused on measuring social well-being by building economic security indices.
Activities.
Since 1999 Menahem has been a member of the Scientific Advisory Council of ATTAC. Recently he published an analysis of the European process of militarization through its relationships with European foreign policy. In August 2008 and in August 2011, Menahem directed workshops on the European militarization: first, in the Attac European Summer University of Saarbrücken. and second in the Attac European Network Academy in Fribourg.
Since 2008, Menahem has also participated in the “Forum for Alternative Indicators of Riches” (FAIR more known according its French acronym) which was founded in order to monitor the activities of the “Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress” chaired by Joseph Stiglitz. Following this path, he has contributed to elaborate the critical analysis of the final report of this commission. In 2011, he published on the web-site of the UNCSD "Rio + 20 Conférence" a paper arguing to enlarge well-being indicators that the United Nations general secretary will have to implement after the Rio+20 Conference. In June 2012, he participated in the Rio+20 Summit, holding a side-event and two self-organized activities in the World People Summit with two other members of FAIR, the Belgium professor Isabelle Cassiers and the French-Indian accountant Muttiah Yogananthan. Their critics were mainly devoted to criticize on environmental grounds the monetization of the sustainability approach by the World Bank and the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep). According Georges Menahem, “the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), a measure introduced by the UNEP and the UN University, would make the world's environmental situation worse: if it is adopted and widely used, it could be very dangerous. It underestimates the depletion of natural resources and overestimates the monetized outcome of GDP, such as GDP and human capital".

Silas M. Stilwell

Silas Moore Stilwell (June 6, 1800 New York City - May 16, 1881 New York City) was an American lawyer and politician.
Biography.
He was the son of Stephen Stilwell, who had fought in the American Revolutionary War and opened a glass factory in 1804 in Woodstock, New York. Silas was educated at Woodstock Free Academy until 1812, then, after his father's bankruptcy, he went to New York City and began to work. 
In 1814, he engaged in surveying in the west, and then settled in Tennessee. In 1822, he was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Afterwards he removed to Virginia, and was Clerk of Tazewell County and a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. He was admitted to the bar in 1824.
He returned to New York in 1828, and was a member from New York County of the New York State Assembly from 1830 to 1833. In 1830, he proposed "An act to abolish imprisonment for debt and to punish fraudulent debtors" in the Assembly which was enacted on April 26, 1831, and became known as the Stilwell Act.
In 1834, he ran for Lieutenant Governor on the Whig ticket with William H. Seward, but they were defeated. He was an alderman in New York City in 1835, and chosen Chairman of the Board of Aldermen. In this year, the political parties were equally divided, and as he had the casting vote on all appointments he became popularly known as "King Caucus". He was Acting Mayor at the time of the Great Fire of New York in 1835. 
He was United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York during President John Tyler's administration. At this time he was sent on a special mission to The Hague to negotiate a loan for the U.S. government. At the end of his term he resumed the practice of law.
He was the author of the National Banking Act in 1863.
He wrote on questions of finance, many of his articles appeared in the "New York Herald" from 1860 to 1872, under the pen-name of "Jonathan Ohlbuck."
He was married to Caroline Norseworthy, and their son was Silas M. Stilwell (1854–1891), a lawyer in New York City.

Taima Mandala

The Taima Mandala (當麻曼荼羅,綴織当麻曼荼羅図) is a mandala in Japanese Pure Land Buddhism. The original copy of the mandala is still housed in the Taima-dera temple in Nara, Japan, and was woven c. 763. The mandala is appointed as a national treasure of Japan on April 27, 1961. Many copies have been made since, and the original work has degraded considerably. According to popular legend, Chūjō-hime witnessed the creation of the mandala, crafted from fibers of lotus stems by two nuns who were thought to be Amida Buddha and Kannon Bodhisattva. The imagery of the Mandala is based mostly on the "Sutra of the Contemplation of Amitayus" 観無量寿経, and has been the subject of several doctrinal commentaries in Japanese Buddhism.
The central image is the Pure Land itself, while the left, right, and lower borders are lined with images from the Contemplation Sutra. The left shows, first, the discovery of the Sutra on Vulture Peak at the top, and then illustrates the introduction of the Sutra, from the bottom upward: Prince Ajasatru's temptation, the imprisonment of his father and then his mother, and Queen Vaidehi's prayers answered by Shakyamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni transmits the knowledge of the Pure Land to his disciple in the last panel, second from the top. 
The right side illustrates the Thirteen Contemplations, from the top down, and the bottom frames illustrate the nine levels of birth.

Hej Sokoly

Hej Sokoly or "Hey Falcons" (, ) is a traditional Polish-Ukrainian song that was popular among soldiers during the Polish-Soviet War. The lyrics exist in several versions about a Ukrainian girl to whom her betrothed, a cossack, says goodbye for the last time.
Although its exact origins are unknown, the song was believed to have been written by the Polish-Ukrainian poet-songwriter Tomasz Padura in the first half of the 19th century. It is representative of what is known as the Ukrainian school of Polish literature. Because of the unclear history of the song, it is sometimes presented as being either, or both, a Polish folk song or Ukrainian folk song. The lyrics vary only slightly between the two languages.
The tune was popular among Polish soldiers during the Polish-Soviet War, and was also sung by the Polish Home Army guerrillas during World War II. Polish folk singer Maryla Rodowicz also performed a popular cover of the song.
Lyrics.
Wiele dziewcząt jest na świecie,
Lecz najwięcej w Ukrainie.
Tam me serce pozostało,
Przy kochanej mej dziewczynie.
Hej, hej, hej sokoły
Omijajcie góry, lasy, pola, doły.
Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń dzwoneczku,
Mój stepowy skowroneczku (Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń)
Ona jedna tam została,
Jaskółeczka moja mała,
A ja tutaj w obcej stronie
Dniem i nocą tęsknię do niej.
Hej, hej, hej sokoły
Omijajcie góry, lasy, pola, doły.
Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń dzwoneczku,
Mój stepowy skowroneczku (Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń)
Żal, żal za dziewczyną,
Za zieloną Ukrainą,
Żal, żal serce płacze,
Już jej więcej nie zobaczę.
Hej, hej, hej sokoły
Omijajcie góry, lasy, pola, doły.
Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń dzwoneczku,
Mój stepowy skowroneczku (Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń)
Wina, wina, wina dajcie,
A jak umrę pochowajcie
Na zielonej Ukrainie
Przy kochanej mej dziewczynie
Hej, hej, hej sokoły
Omijajcie góry, lasy, pola, doły.
Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń dzwoneczku,
Mój stepowy skowroneczku (Dzwoń, dzwoń, dzwoń)
Дзвін, дзвін, дзвін, дзвіночку,
За рідною стороною.
Більше її не побачу.
Оминайте гори, ліси, доли.
Степовий жайвороночку
Оминайте гори, ліси, доли.
Мій степовий дзвін, дзвін, дзвін
Як загину поховайте
Коло милої дівчини.
Оминайте гори, ліси, доли.
Степовий жайвороночку
Оминайте гори, ліси, доли.
Мій степовий дзвін, дзвін, дзвін
Сів на коня козак молодий
Їде козак з України
Оминайте гори, ліси, доли.
Степовий жайвороночку
Оминайте гори, ліси, доли.

Fortunatus of Casei

Saint Fortunatus of Casei () is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. Tradition makes him a member of the Theban Legion, and thus martyred at Agaunum. However, his relics were situated in the catacombs of Saint Callixtus in Rome until 1746, when Cardinal Guadagni, Roman vicar to Benedict XIV, re-exhumed and displayed Fortunatus’ relics in the collegiate church of Santa Maria in Via Lata in Rome. It is unclear how the relics of Fortunatus reached Rome from the saint’s supposed place of death in the Swiss Alps. 
From Santa Maria in Via Lata, Fortunatus’ relics were translated to Casei Gerola in 1765, as a gift to the church there from the Holy See. Casei Gerola, in the province of Pavia, was an important village of the diocese of Tortona, which had close ties to the papacy. His relics were kept in an urn; Fortunatus’ skull was crushed, indicating the cause of death to be a fatal blow to the head. 
Another source states that he was venerated in the catacombs of Saint Priscilla in Rome until 1600, when some of his relics were translated to Turbigo, although his relics were also claimed by Casei from 1700 onwards. There may have been two saints with the same name of Fortunatus. Some of his relics are also claimed by the parish of Lonate Pozzolo. 
He was proclaimed patron saint of Pantelleria after he is believed to have aided the island through miraculous intervention during an earthquake in 1831 and a seaquake in 1891. A procession in honor of the saint is held on October 16; a statue of the saint is carried on a boat.

Counter-pressure brake

The counter-pressure brake (German: "Gegendruckbremse"), also named the Riggenbach counter-pressure brake after its inventor, Niklaus Riggenbach, is a dynamic railway brake on steam locomotives that brakes the locomotive using the driving cylinders. In doing so it reduces wear and tear and overheating of the driving wheel tyres and brake blocks and enables a continuously high brake force to be applied. The brake works by using the cylinders as air compressors and converting kinetic energy into heat. Steam is emitted during braking but this does not come from the boiler, it is produced by evaporation of water used to cool the cylinders.
The main part of the system is piping and regulation of atmospheric air drawn into the cylinders, into which cooling water and oil is injected.
Operation.
To use the cylinders as pumps necessitates complete reversal of the normal gas flow. Atmospheric air is drawn through the steam exhaust and compressed air ejected through the steam inlet. A separate chimney is provided, usually behind the main chimney, to exhaust the compressed air without increasing flow through the smokebox (which would cause increased draught of the fire).
Water injected into the incoming air evaporates during compression, carrying away much of the heat generated. Oil is also injected into the incoming air to maintain lubrication of the cylinders.
Use.
Austria and Germany.
Counter-pressure brakes were found especially on steam engines that worked long inclines and on rack railway locomotives (e.g. on the Vienna Kahlenberg Railway ("Kahlenbergbahn"), relieving brake blocks and tyres from high levels of wear and tear that they would otherwise be subjected to. 
For operation on ramps its availability was indispensable because these dynamic brakes on steam locomotives provided the required third independent set of brakes. 
A further area of use was in measurement and testing using braking locomotives to provide continuous load on railway vehicles being tested in normal running. For this niche activity a number of steam locomotives survived in Germany until the middle of the 1970s.
Wales.
Counter-pressure brakes are used on the steam locomotives of the Snowdon Mountain Railway.
Countersteam brake.
The counter-pressure brake should not be confused with the countersteam brake (German:"Gegendampfbremse"), which is not considered an auxiliary braking system.

Yanmar 2GM20

The Yanmar 2GM20 is an inboard marine diesel engine manufactured by the Japanese company Yanmar Co. Ltd.. It is used in a wide range of sailboats and motorboats.
Specifications.
It is a four-stroke, vertical, water-cooled diesel engine. It is built around two cylinders (hence the "2" in 2GM20) of 75 mm in diameter and 72 mm in stroke, adding up to 0.635 liters in displacement: each cylinder is roughly the size and volume of a 300ml soft-drink can. The compression system uses a proprietary swirl-type pre-combustion chamber.
The continuous rating output at the crankshaft is 11.8 kW, and 3400 revolutions per minute (rpm). The maximum output at crankshaft is 13.4 kW, and 3600 rpm. 
The engine delivers roughly 16 horsepower, for a weight of about 114 kg.
The engine is equipped with a starting motor (D.C. 12V, 1 kW), and an alternator to provide electricity and charge onboard batteries (12V, 55A).
The engine is typically activated by a key and a starting motor switch. Upon turning the key and pressing the starting motor switch, the oil pressure alarm will ring for about a second until the engine starts to run. The exit of cooling water from the exhaust into the sea (typically at the aft of the boat) should be checked at that time. After a few minutes, the hot cooling water alarm will sound if the cooling water does not get through the engine (as when the seawater cock has remained closed -most likely case- or if something is clogging the seawater tubing). 
Water pump.
The 2GM20 series uses either a direct seawater cooling system, or an indirect freshwater cooling system (specified by the suffix letter F i.e. 2GM20F). Seawater is pumped into the engine through a seawater pump (impeller type). In the engines equipped with a direct seawater cooling system, seawater is used to cool the internals of the engine directly. The engines equipped with a freshwater cooling system have an additional heat exchanger, where heat transfer occurs between the seawater and internal freshwater. 
The impeller of the seawater pump can suffer from wear and tear, especially when run dry for some period of time, in which case it has to be replaced to avoid loss in the flow of cooling seawater, a potential source of engine overheating.
A particularly difficult problem in Spanish and Portuguese waters is jellyfish. Their tentacles can be sucked into water intakes. In extremis it is possible for the rubber exhaust hose to catch fire, the plastic silencer to melt and the head-gasket to fail. In colder British waters boats are far less likely to meet such problems. The solution is to have a large basket-type water strainer and overheat alarms (standard on most Yanmar engines) 
The seawater pump is rotated by a short belt linked to the crankshaft.
Fuel filter.
An inline fuel filter is easily accessible from the front part of the engine. The filter retains solid particles and separates water from diesel (as water is heavier than diesel, it will settle at the bottom of the filter), just before the diesel fuel enters the highly sensitive high-pressure fuel pump. Water inside diesel fuel can lead to rusting of the internals of the engine, as well as lubrication problems. The filter element is made of fluted paper with metal end caps. 
When the engine has to be bled because air has penetrated into the pipes (usually after running out of diesel), it will usually be necessary to bleed the diesel filter: the top vent is unscrewed so as to let excess air escape, while diesel fuel is pumped into the fuel filter with the manual fuel lift pump (just behind the yellow dipstick). The vent can be screwed shut when diesel fuel starts to gush out of it. 
A primary fuel filter is usually installed upstream of the engine, so as to filter out the larger particles, and filter a larger quantity of water that might be present in the fuel.
Every time a filter is disassembled or changed, it will be necessary to bleed it so as to remove excess air, again by opening the top vent so as to let diesel chase all the air (diesel fills up the filter either through gravity -usually the case for the primary filter- or with the help of the fuel lift pump -usually the case for the engine fuel filter-) and diesel starts to gush out. The vent should then be screwed shut.
New models.
The 2GM20 and 3GM30 (three-cylinder) series have now been superseded in the Yanmar catalog by new lightweight and modernized engines, the 2YM15, 3YM20 and 3YM30. These new engines also feature simplified maintenance of the seawater pump and other services points, as they are now located on the front part of the engine.

CSS Lark

The Lark was a paddle steamer employed by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. She was the last blockade runner to successfully escape from a Southern port before the Union blockade completely closed off this vital source of supplies.
"Lark" was designed and built by John Laird & Sons. The ship made four successful round trips through the blockade between Galveston, Texas, and Havana, Cuba. In April 1865, she ran aground near the entrance to Galveston harbor. Two launches dispatched from the Union blockading squadron attacked the "Lark", which managed to fend off the assault with help from Confederate ground forces. On May 24, she dashed into Galveston again and managed to slip through the blockade back out to open sea, the last Confederate blockade runner to do so.

Tersk Stud

The Tersk Stud was officially established on February 11, 1921, on the orders of Marshal Semyon Budyonny. The breeding farm was used to restore the Russian horse population, which suffered heavy losses during the Russian Revolution.
Early history.
In the 1880s, Count Sergei Aleksandrovich Stroganov and his brother-in-law Prince Aleksandr Grigorievich Shcherbatov found a spot at the foot of Mount Zmeika (“small snake” in Russian) in the Northern Caucasus they felt was ideal for establishing a horse breeding farm. The two traveled to the Middle East in 1889 and purchased several purebred Arabian horses for use in their new breeding program. Stroganov also purchased horses from Crabbet Arabian Stud in England, including the mares Makbula and Sobha, and the stallion Mesaoud, who came from Crabbet Stud by way of Kleniewski Stud in modern-day Poland.
Russian Revolution & Civil War.
Shcherbatov died in 1915. During the 1917 Russian Revolution, Stroganov fled to Paris where he remained with his family until he died in 1923. The Stroganov estate was seized by Russian revolutionaries and none of the Arabians of the Stroganov and Shcherbatov programs are known to have survived the Russian Revolution. In 1921 Marshal Semyon Budyonny, an accomplished horseman and cavalry officer, ordered two farms near Mineralnye Vody, the former Stroganov breeding farm and the nearby farm of White Army General Sultan Ghirey-Klych to be renamed and used for restoring the devastated Russian horse population. Today the stud is known as Tersky Horse-Breeding Farm No. 169.
There is no indication Stroganov and Shcherbatov or their breeding stock had any involvement in the founding of the Soviet-run Tersk Stud.
Soviet-era Arabian horse program.
Arabians were re-introduced to the new Tersk Stud in 1925 and the first French Arabian imports arrived in 1930. These included the stallion Kann and six mares, most notable of which was Carabine. Koheilan IV was imported from Hungary. The French horses had generally good conformation but were lacking Arabian type, so the stud’s managers searched for quality breeding stock with the characteristic Arabian refinement. In 1936, a shipment of 25 horses came from Crabbet Arabian Stud in England, some of which were descended from horses that had lived at the Stroganov and Shcherbatov stud and perished during the revolution. There were six stallions in the purchase, of which Naseem (a son of Skowronek and great-grandson of Mesaoud) was the most influential. Among the mares, Rissalma, Rixalina, and Star of the Hills left a significant impression on the breed. Tersk attempted to purchase Skowronek himself from Crabbet Stud, but he was not for sale.
World War II added significant bloodstock to Tersk, at the expense of Poland’s Arabian breeding program. In 1939 the Soviets removed many of the best Arabians bred at Janów Podlaski Stud in Poland and marched them over 1,000 miles back to Tersk Stud. Ofir did not sire the same caliber of horses at Tersk as he did in Poland.
In 1941, to evade the advancing German troops, the Tersk horses were evacuated to western Kazakhstan where they faced harsh weather and terrain. However, they returned to Tersk in 1943 with few losses.
The Ofir daughter, Mammona, had an extensive influence upon the Tersk breeding program. She produced the stallion Pomeranets, who influenced both the Arabian and Trakehner breeds; the mares Nomenklatura (dam of Nabeg), Monopolia (dam of Monogramma), Metropolia (dam of *Menes), Malpia (dam of *Muscat, 1980 U.S. & Canadian National Champion Stallion, and *Moment), and *Magnolia (dam of *Marsianin, 1981 U.S. National Champion Stallion).
Aside from Ofir, other notable stallions brought to Tersk from Poland included Piolun, the sire of Priboj (out of Rissalma, who had been purchased from Crabbet Arabian Stud); and Taki Pan, the sire of the mare Taktika, who produced the mare Ptashka and the stallions *Pietuszok and Topol (all by Priboj). Topol's son Naftalin sired very good racehorses, including Aspect, who won an amazing 28 of 39 races. *Pietuszok was exported to Poland in 1958, where he sired successful racehorses like Wosk, *Orzel, and Wilma (the dam of *Wiking, whose offspring have earned over $8 million in purses).
Another of the confiscated Polish mares, Taraszcza, was bred to the Crabbet-bred stallion Naseem at Tersk and foaled a grey colt named Negativ in 1945. Negativ sired 12 foal crops in Russia, but because they did not excel on the racetrack he was sold to Poland in 1962, renamed “Negatiw,” and sired better racehorses out of the Polish mares.
Negativ’s best-siring sons at Tersk were Suvenir and *Salon, the latter the sire of both the U.S. and Canadian National Champion Stallion *Muscat and Tersk head sire *Moment. Another Negativ son, Nabor (later renamed *Naborr when he was imported to the U.S.), sired just 9 registered foals at Tersk, apparently because his offspring were considered too delicate for the Tersk program, and was exported to Poland in 1955. The Poles sought a stallion of the Ibrahim sire line, and had hoped to purchase Negativ from Tersk but were unable at the time, but were satisfied to own his son Nabor instead. Nabor was exported to the U.S. in 1963, becoming the first Tersk-bred Arabian to go to the States. *Naborr was owned in the United States by Anne McCormack, and then upon her death was purchased at auction by Tom Chauncey and entertainer Wayne Newton.
None of Negativ’s Tersk-bred daughters had a significant influence on the Tersk program.
After World War II, Tersk imported a few stallions from Poland: Arax in 1958, Semen in 1962, and Elfur (a full brother to *El Paso) in 1972. Of these stallions, Arax had the greatest impact on Tersk’s program, siring the influential stallion Nabeg and a number of quality daughters. 
Nabeg's most influential daughters include the U.S. National Top Ten Mare *Poznan, and Pesnianka, a dam of race and show champions in Europe.
Nabeg’s sons include the stallions *Menes, *Pesniar, and *Nariadni, all three imported to the U.S. Peleng, another son, was sold for $3.2 million but tested positive for piroplasmosis (Equine babesiosis) and was never permitted to enter the U.S. Nabeg can also be found in Trakehner pedigrees through some of his sons and daughters. Unfortunately Nabeg died young, having left only eight foal crops.
In 1958, the Sid Abouhom son Nil (named Azmy in Egypt) was a gift to the Soviet Union from Egypt in appreciation for the USSR’s assistance in funding the Aswan Dam. Nil sired only 16 foals before his untimely death in 1960, but still left a lasting impression on the Tersk program. His loss was unfortunate because, based on his structure and brief siring record, Nil could have been as significant to Tersk as his successor. In 1963, the Egyptian government gave another stallion to the Soviet Union, Raafat by Nazeer, who was renamed Aswan by the Soviets in honor of the dam project. 
Aswan had a profound influence on the Tersk breeding program. As a whole, the broodmare band at Tersk had generally good structure but lacked some elements of Arabian type. Aswan introduced a more extreme dished head with large nostrils, large expressive eye, long level croup, and high tail carriage. He also had obvious faults, such as offset front knees, post-legged back legs, a long low back, a "wasp-waist," and a thick neck and throatlatch. But because Aswan’s faults were different than the Tersk mares’ faults, they often complemented each other well.
Aswan sired 299 offspring over 20 seasons at Tersk, more than any other stallion in the stud’s history. Some of Aswan’s best-known sons included Palas (out of a daughter of Nil, the first stallion given to the USSR by Egypt), who was exported to Poland and became a head sire at Janow Podlaski for many years; Kilimanjaro, a German National Reserve Champion who sired champions in North America and Europe; Patron, who sired the U.S. and Canadian National Champion Stallion *Padron before his untimely death; and Plakat, a European champion who sired many champions himself.
Aswan excelled at siring broodmares. Examples include Pesnia, the dam of *Pesniar, who was purchased for $1 million and imported to the U.S. in 1981; Molva, called Aswan’s most beautiful and best-producing daughter by former Tersk director Alexander Ponomarev and the dam of Wympel; and Karinka, a full sister to Kilimanjaro, an accomplished race mare and the dam of Russian Derby winner and European Champion Stallion Drug.
The *Menes son Balaton, out of the Aswan daughter Panagia, was foaled in 1982 at Tersk and was immediately identified as the stud’s next great hope. Balaton became one of the youngest stallions to become a head sire at Tersk at just three years of age, and Tersk Director Alexander Ponomarev called him "the horse of the century at Tersk" after his first foal crop arrived.
The Balaton son Kubinec, out of the *Muscat daughter Kosmetika, was foaled at Tersk in 1987. A chestnut with a wide blaze going all the way over his nose and lips, Kubinec’s white markings weren't considered acceptable in the Tersk breeding program. According to Dr. O.A. Balakshin of the All Russian Research Institute of Horse Breeding, “Too many horses now have white markings on their head and legs. This is undesirable and should be eliminated by selection.”. Kubinec was sold in 1991 and began making his mark in European show rings. He was named German National, European, and World Champion Stallion as well as European Conference of Arab Horse Organizations (ECAHO) "Five Star Stallion" and his offspring are desirable around the world today.
In the mid-1980s, Tersk Stud introduced a few different outcross stallions, such as the Polish imports Gvizd ("Gwizd" in Poland) and Harfiaj ("Harfiarz" in Poland) and the English-bred pure Spanish Esplendor. Gvizd, Harfiaj, and Esplendor left Tersk but some of their descendants were used in the Tersk breeding program. Of the three outcross stallions, Gvizd had the greatest influence through a few of his daughters and his son, Negasimyi, who later became a sire of racehorses at Tersk in the mid-1990s. Gvizd's daughter Purga produced the stallion Padishah (by race winner Drug), who won several halter championships in Europe in the early 2000s. Gvizd also sired Pogojii, winner of four stakes races in Russia.
Post-1991 stud history.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought Tersk's future into question.
Influence of American buyers.
By the mid-1980s, Russian Arabians were viewed as an exotic and profitable business in the U.S. Notable examples include *Pesniar, who was purchased from Tersk in 1981 for $1 million, and Peleng, who was purchased for "well in excess of $3 million" in 1985. Before American-purchased Tersk Arabians were eligible for registration in the U.S., Howard F. Kale traded two Standardbred stallions worth $1 million each to Tersk Stud for the stallion *Muscat.
Russian horses also retained their value within the U.S. A half-interest in the aged broodmare *Nariadnaia was sold at auction in the U.S. for $580,000 in 1983 and the stallion *Abdullahhh was sold for $3.2 million at a U.S. auction in 1984. The Soviets noticed the inflated prices that westerners were willing to pay for their horses and accordingly set high reserves on their auction lots.
Prices began to come down at the annual Tersk auction starting in 1985 and the values of all big-investment Arabian horses dropped dramatically after the U.S. tax laws were changed in 1986. After that point, breeding "straight Russian" Arabians, or horses that were descended only from Tersk-bred horses, was not as common in the U.S. Some American breeders increasingly crossed Russian-bred horses with other lines to produce more exotic type and movement, while Arabian sport horse breeders outcrossed to Russian lines for their athletic ability.
Acceptance by the American Arabian registry.
The Arabian Horse Registry of America (AHRA) did not approve the Russian Stud Book until 1978, meaning any Arabians imported to the U.S. directly from Tersk Stud were not permitted to be registered. The reason given by the Registry in a letter to Mr. Ed Tweed was “we mustn’t deal with the Russians” after Tweed attempted to register the Tersk-bred mares *Napaika and *Palmira and the stallion *Park in 1963. Tweed argued that the Tersk-bred *Naborr was registered by AHRA that same year with no problems, to which the registry replied that a Russian-bred horse may be registered by AHRA as long as the horse was owned in England or Poland for several years before its sale to the U.S. (*Naborr was sold by Tersk to Poland and used there for a number of years before he was imported to the U.S.) “We (Americans) are not as intimately acquainted with the Russians as the Poles and British, and we need not deal with them.”
AHRA eventually accepted and approved the registering of Arabians imported directly from the Soviet Union in 1978, and *Napaika and *Palmira were registered that same year.
Tersk environment.
Tersk Stud is located in the Caucasus Mountains in southern European Russia. The nearby town, Mineralnye Vody, means "mineral waters" and is renowned as a spa town. The abundant natural mineral springs and beautiful scenery draw visitors from around the world. The weather is mild, ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.
While the weather is not harsh, the mares and foals at Tersk Stud live a rugged life outdoors most of the time. There are no fences around the stud, so mounted watchmen follow and monitor the herds night and day. The horses are brought into the barn twice each day to be fed and checked, but otherwise they are free to enjoy the open spaces.
Breeding operations.
Tersk is best known for its purebred Arabian horses, but it has also hosted breeding programs for Akhal-Tekes, Terskys, Kabardins, and Dons. All Terskys were transferred to nearby Stavropol Stud in 1945 to continue the development of the new breed.
From the beginning of its history, the stud has tested its horses on the racetrack. Tersk Arabians are sent to the Pyatigorsk racetrack at the age of two and may race one or two seasons. The best performers race on Sundays, with two-year-olds running 1,400 meters and older horses running 1,600 and 1,800 meters. The top individuals may be used for breeding at Tersk or return to the racetrack for another season. Many others will be sold at the age of three. 
While race records are important to the Tersk breeding program, Dr. Balakshin stated “…good racing results are not the only criterion for selecting young stock for breeding purposes. Excellent runners which deviate from breed type may be used for limited breeding or else they are eliminated from selection.”
Any horse used for breeding at Tersk is required to be rated “Elite” or “Grade I” in the Russian Stud Book. Horses that receive lower grades are sent to other studs or sold.
The current stud director is Vladimir Tolmachyov.

<doc id="18233520" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18233520" title="Acharya S">
Acharya S

Dorothy M. Murdock, also known by her pen name Acharya S, is an American author and proponent of the Christ myth theory. She writes books, and operates a website named "Truth be Known". She argues that Christianity is founded on earlier myths and the characters depicted in Christianity are based upon Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and other myths. Her theories have received negative commentaries from academic scholars.
In her various books, she describes the New Testament as a work of mythic fiction within a historical setting. She claims that the story of Jesus Christ is a retelling of various pagan myths, representing "astrotheology", or the story of the Sun, and also incorporates the science of archaeoastronomy. She asserts the pagans understood the stories to be myths, but Christians obliterated evidence to the contrary by destroying and controlling literature when they attained control of the Roman Empire, which led to widespread illiteracy in the ancient world, ensuring the mythical nature of Christ's story was hidden.
Murdock compares Jesus' history to other "savior-gods" such as Mithra, Horus, Adonis, Krishna, Quetzalcoatl, and Odin, claiming the similarities result from a common source: the myth of the sun-god or solar deity. Her theories resemble those that were abandoned by mainstream scholars a century ago. 
Life.
According to her website, Murdock received a Bachelor of Liberal Arts degree in Classics, Greek Civilization, from Franklin and Marshall College, after which she spent a year at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece.
Writing career.
As a writer she publishes under the title of "acharya," a term from Hinduism for the teacher or leader of a religious group. 
In 1999, as Acharya S, she published her first book, "The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold", arguing the concept of Jesus Christ as myth. She states the Christ story is a fabrication. In 2001, she wrote the foreword to a new edition of "The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Christianity Before Christ", a book by 19th-century skeptic Kersey Graves.
A follow-up book, "Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled", was published in 2004. In it she comments on the Hindu story of the life of Krishna, as well as the life of Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama). She claims parallels to the Christian stories of the life of Jesus as evidence that the story of Jesus was written based on existing stories, and not the life of a real man. "Suns of God" also seeks to address some of the criticisms leveled at "Christ Conspiracy".
She founded Seattle based Stellar House Publishing in 2005, through which she self-publishes a number of her books. According to the website, they claim to specialize in "Archaeology, History, Astrotheology, Mythology and Religion".
In 2005–06 she was one of fifty Fellows of The Council for Secular Humanism's Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion (CSER).
Her 2007 book, "Who Was Jesus? Fingerprints of The Christ" continues the theme of "The Christ Conspiracy" by expanding her theory questioning the historical validity of Jesus Christ alleging "early Christian history to be largely mythical, by sorting through available historical and archaeological data."
In 2009 she released "Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection" and "The Gospel According to Acharya S". Her work was used in part 1 of "", for which she acted as consultant.
She has been interviewed on a variety of radio stations, including the Alan Colmes Show. She also appears on podcasts such as Black Op Radio, and Coffee, Cigarettes and Gnosis. She has been interviewed in "Paranoia" magazine and by "The Progressive Observer".
Reception.
In his book "In Search of Jesus", Baptist comparative religion scholar Clinton Bennett describes her views as being similar to those of radical freethinker Robert Taylor (nicknamed "the Devil's chaplain"), secularist MP and fellow Christ mythicist John M. Robertson, and American mythographer Joseph Campbell. In an article for "The Christian Century", Butler University religion professor James F. McGrath describes her viewpoint as one that "once had some currency among scholars" in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but was subsequently abandoned.
In his book "Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth", New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman discusses "The Christ Conspiracy" which he calls "the breathless conspirator's dream". Ehrman says "all of Acharya's major points are in fact wrong" and her book "is filled with so many factual errors and outlandish assertions that it is hard to believe the author is serious." Taking her as representative of some other writers about the Christ myth theory, he generalizes that "Mythicists of this ilk should not be surprised that their views are not taken seriously by real scholars, mentioned by experts in the field, or even read by them."
Acharya S was criticized by Joel McDurmon, in part for the premise that Jesus was based on ancient sun gods because of the modern English homophones "son" and "sun". Atheist activist and fellow Christ mythicist Richard Carrier criticized her use of the inscriptions at Luxor to make the claim that the story of Jesus birth was inspired by the Luxor story of the birth of Horus. Acharya S produced a rejoinder to Carrier's critique in which she describes the importance of the ancient Egyptian narratives of the birth of gods such as the one described at Luxor, the connections that existed between Egypt and the ancient Hebrew people and asks "ould the creators of Christianity really have been oblivious to them?" Theologian Robert M. Price, who is sympathetic to the Christ myth hypothesis, wrote a critical review of Murdock's first book. However, he subsequently promoted her book "Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled" in "The Pre-Nicene New Testament: Fifty-Four Formative Texts", and wrote the foreword to "Who Was Jesus?: Fingerprints of the Christ".
Her presentation of Christianity as a "conspiracy" has drawn positive attention from other conspiracy theorists and critics of Christianity. In his book "You Are Being Lied To", Russ Kick describes "The Christ Conspiracy" as "an essential book for anyone who wants to know the reality behind the world's dominant religion." In a book on American conspiracy theorists, Kenn Thomas calls her a "great chronicler of the conspiracy known as Christianity".

Hypnic headache

Hypnic headaches are benign primary headaches that affect the elderly, with the average age of onset being 63 ± 11 years. They are moderate, throbbing, bilateral or unilateral headaches that wake the sufferer from sleep once or multiple times a night. They typically begin a few hours after sleep begins and can last from 15–180 min. There is normally no nausea, photophobia, phonophobia or autonomic symptoms associated with the headache. They commonly occur at the same time every night possibly linking the headaches with circadian rhythm, but polysomnography has recently revealed that the onset of hypnic headaches may be associated with REM sleep.
Lithium carbonate 200–600 mg at bedtime is an effective treatment for most patients but for those that can not tolerate Lithium, Verapamil, indomethacin or methylsergilide may be tried. Two patients have also responded to flunarizine 5 mg. It has also been shown that 1–2 cups of coffee or 100–200 mg of caffeine before bed can prevent hypnic headaches. 
For diagnosis of hypnic headache syndrome, headaches should occur at least 15 times per month for at least one month. Included in the differential diagnosis of a new onset nighttime headaches in the elderly is drug withdrawal, temporal arteritis, Sleep apnea, oxygen desaturated, Pheochromocytoma, intracranial causes, primary and secondary neoplasms, communicating hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, vascular lesions, migraines, cluster headaches, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and hypnic headache. All other causes must be ruled out before the diagnosis of hypnic headache can be made.

Finite element method

In mathematics, the finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to boundary value problems for differential equations. It uses variational methods (the calculus of variations) to minimize an error function and produce a stable solution. Analogous to the idea that connecting many tiny straight lines can approximate a larger circle, FEM encompasses all the methods for connecting many simple element equations over many small subdomains, named finite elements, to approximate a more complex equation over a larger domain.
History.
While it is difficult to quote a date of the invention of the finite element method, the method originated from the need to solve complex elasticity and structural analysis problems in civil and aeronautical engineering. Its development can be traced back to the work by A. Hrennikoff and R. Courant. In China, in the later 1950s and early 1960s, based on the computations of dam constructions, K. Feng proposed a systematic numerical method for solving partial differential equations. The method was called the finite difference method based on variation principle, which was another independent invention of finite element method. Although the approaches used by these pioneers are different, they share one essential characteristic: mesh discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete sub-domains, usually called elements.
Hrennikoff's work discretizes the domain by using a lattice analogy, while Courant's approach divides the domain into finite triangular subregions to solve second order elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise from the problem of torsion of a cylinder. Courant's contribution was evolutionary, drawing on a large body of earlier results for PDEs developed by Rayleigh, Ritz, and Galerkin.
The finite element method obtained its real impetus in the 1960s and 1970s by the developments of J. H. Argyris with co-workers at the University of Stuttgart, R. W. Clough with co-workers at UC Berkeley, O. C. Zienkiewicz with co-workers at the University of Swansea, Philippe G. Ciarlet at the University of Paris 6 and Richard Gallagher with co-workers at Cornell University. Further impetus was provided in these years by available open source finite element software programs. NASA sponsored the original version of NASTRAN, and UC Berkeley made the finite element program SAP IV widely available. A rigorous mathematical basis to the finite element method was provided in 1973 with the publication by Strang and Fix. The method has since been generalized for the numerical modeling of physical systems in a wide variety of engineering disciplines, e.g., electromagnetism, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics.
Technical discussion.
General principles.
The subdivision of a whole domain into simpler parts has several advantages:
A typical work out of the method involves (1) dividing the domain of the problem into a collection of subdomains, with each subdomain represented by a set of element equations to the original problem, followed by (2) systematically recombining all sets of element equations into a global system of equations for the final calculation. The global system of equations has known solution techniques, and can be calculated from the initial values of the original problem to obtain a numerical answer.
In the first step above, the element equations are simple equations that locally approximate the original complex equations to be studied, where the original equations are often partial differential equations (PDE). To explain the approximation in this process, FEM is commonly introduced as a special case of Galerkin method. The process, in mathematics language, is to construct an integral of the inner product of the residual and the weight functions and set the integral to zero. In simple terms, it is a procedure that minimizes the error of approximation by fitting trial functions into the PDE. The residual is the error caused by the trial functions, and the weight functions are polynomial approximation functions that project the residual. The process eliminates all the spatial derivatives from the PDE, thus approximating the PDE locally with
These equation sets are the element equations. They are linear if the underlying PDE is linear, and vice versa. Algebraic equation sets that arise in the steady state problems are solved using numerical linear algebra methods, while ordinary differential equation sets that arise in the transient problems are solved by numerical integration using standard techniques such as Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method.
In step (2) above, a global system of equations is generated from the element equations through a transformation of coordinates from the subdomains' local nodes to the domain's global nodes. This spatial transformation includes appropriate orientation adjustments as applied in relation to the reference coordinate system. The process is often carried out by FEM software using coordinate data generated from the subdomains.
FEM is best understood from its practical application, known as finite element analysis (FEA). FEA as applied in engineering is a computational tool for performing engineering analysis. It includes the use of mesh generation techniques for dividing a complex problem into small elements, as well as the use of software program coded with FEM algorithm. In applying FEA, the complex problem is usually a physical system with the underlying physics such as the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, the heat equation, or the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in either PDE or integral equations, while the divided small elements of the complex problem represent different areas in the physical system. 
FEA is a good choice for analyzing problems over complicated domains (like cars and oil pipelines), when the domain changes (as during a solid state reaction with a moving boundary), when the desired precision varies over the entire domain, or when the solution lacks smoothness. For instance, in a frontal crash simulation it is possible to increase prediction accuracy in "important" areas like the front of the car and reduce it in its rear (thus reducing cost of the simulation). Another example would be in numerical weather prediction, where it is more important to have accurate predictions over developing highly nonlinear phenomena (such as tropical cyclones in the atmosphere, or eddies in the ocean) rather than relatively calm areas.
Illustrative problems P1 and P2.
We will illustrate the finite element method using two sample problems from which the general method can be extrapolated. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with calculus and linear algebra.
P1 is a one-dimensional problem
where formula_2 is given, formula_3 is an unknown function of formula_4, and formula_5 is the second derivative of formula_3 with respect to formula_4.
P2 is a two-dimensional problem (Dirichlet problem)
where formula_9 is a connected open region in the formula_10 plane whose boundary formula_11 is "nice" (e.g., a smooth manifold or a polygon), and formula_12 and formula_13 denote the second derivatives with respect to formula_4 and formula_15, respectively.
The problem P1 can be solved "directly" by computing antiderivatives. However, this method of solving the boundary value problem works only when there is one spatial dimension and does not generalize to higher-dimensional problems or to problems like formula_16. For this reason, we will develop the finite element method for P1 and outline its generalization to P2.
Our explanation will proceed in two steps, which mirror two essential steps one must take to solve a boundary value problem (BVP) using the FEM.
After this second step, we have concrete formulae for a large but finite dimensional linear problem whose solution will approximately solve the original BVP. This finite dimensional problem is then implemented on a computer.
Weak formulation.
The first step is to convert P1 and P2 into their equivalent weak formulations.
The weak form of P1.
If formula_3 solves P1, then for any smooth function formula_18 that satisfies the displacement boundary conditions, i.e. formula_19 at formula_20 and formula_21, we have
(1) formula_22
Conversely, if formula_3 with formula_24 satisfies (1) for every smooth function formula_25 then one may show that this formula_3 will solve P1. The proof is easier for twice continuously differentiable formula_3 (mean value theorem), but may be proved in a distributional sense as well.
By using integration by parts on the right-hand-side of (1), we obtain
(2)formula_28
where we have used the assumption that formula_29.
The weak form of P2.
If we integrate by parts using a form of Green's identities, we see that if formula_3 solves P2, then for any formula_18,
where formula_33 denotes the gradient and formula_34 denotes the dot product in the two-dimensional plane. Once more formula_35 can be turned into an inner product on a suitable space formula_36 of "once differentiable" functions of formula_9 that are zero on formula_11. We have also assumed that formula_39 (see Sobolev spaces). Existence and uniqueness of the solution can also be shown.
A proof outline of existence and uniqueness of the solution.
We can loosely think of formula_40 to be the absolutely continuous functions of formula_41 that are formula_42 at formula_20 and formula_21 (see Sobolev spaces). Such functions are (weakly) "once differentiable" and it turns out that the symmetric bilinear map formula_45 then defines an inner product which turns formula_40 into a Hilbert space (a detailed proof is nontrivial). On the other hand, the left-hand-side formula_47 is also an inner product, this time on the Lp space formula_48. An application of the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces shows that there is a unique formula_3 solving (2) and therefore P1. This solution is a-priori only a member of formula_40, but using elliptic regularity, will be smooth if formula_2 is.
Discretization.
P1 and P2 are ready to be discretized which leads to a common sub-problem (3). The basic idea is to replace the infinite dimensional linear problem:
with a finite dimensional version:
where formula_56 is a finite dimensional subspace of formula_57. There are many possible choices for formula_56 (one possibility leads to the spectral method). However, for the finite element method we take formula_56 to be a space of piecewise polynomial functions.
For problem P1.
We take the interval formula_41, choose formula_61 values of formula_4 with formula_63 and we define formula_56 by:
where we define formula_66 and formula_67. Observe that functions in formula_56 are not differentiable according to the elementary definition of calculus. Indeed, if formula_69 then the derivative is typically not defined at any formula_70, formula_71. However, the derivative exists at every other value of formula_4 and one can use this derivative for the purpose of integration by parts.
For problem P2.
We need formula_56 to be a set of functions of formula_9. In the figure on the right, we have illustrated a triangulation of a 15 sided polygonal region formula_9 in the plane (below), and a piecewise linear function (above, in color) of this polygon which is linear on each triangle of the triangulation; the space formula_56 would consist of functions that are linear on each triangle of the chosen triangulation.
One often reads formula_77 instead of formula_56 in the literature. The reason is that one hopes that as the underlying triangular grid becomes finer and finer, the solution of the discrete problem (3) will in some sense converge to the solution of the original boundary value problem P2. The triangulation is then indexed by a real valued parameter formula_79 which one takes to be very small. This parameter will be related to the size of the largest or average triangle in the triangulation. As we refine the triangulation, the space of piecewise linear functions formula_56 must also change with formula_81, hence the notation formula_77. Since we do not perform such an analysis, we will not use this notation.
Choosing a basis.
To complete the discretization, we must select a basis of formula_56. In the one-dimensional case, for each control point formula_84 we will choose the piecewise linear function formula_85 in formula_56 whose value is formula_87 at formula_84 and zero at every formula_89, i.e.,
for formula_91; this basis is a shifted and scaled tent function. For the two-dimensional case, we choose again one basis function formula_85 per vertex formula_84 of the triangulation of the planar region formula_9. The function formula_85 is the unique function of formula_56 whose value is formula_87 at formula_84 and zero at every formula_89.
Depending on the author, the word "element" in "finite element method" refers either to the triangles in the domain, the piecewise linear basis function, or both. So for instance, an author interested in curved domains might replace the triangles with curved primitives, and so might describe the elements as being curvilinear. On the other hand, some authors replace "piecewise linear" by "piecewise quadratic" or even "piecewise polynomial". The author might then say "higher order element" instead of "higher degree polynomial". Finite element method is not restricted to triangles (or tetrahedra in 3-d, or higher order simplexes in multidimensional spaces), but can be defined on quadrilateral subdomains (hexahedra, prisms, or pyramids in 3-d, and so on). Higher order shapes (curvilinear elements) can be defined with polynomial and even non-polynomial shapes (e.g. ellipse or circle).
Examples of methods that use higher degree piecewise polynomial basis functions are the
hp-FEM and spectral FEM.
More advanced implementations (adaptive finite element methods) utilize a method to assess the quality of the results (based on error estimation theory) and modify the mesh during the solution aiming to achieve approximate solution within some bounds from the 'exact' solution of the continuum problem. Mesh adaptivity may utilize various techniques, the most popular are:
Small support of the basis.
The primary advantage of this choice of basis is that the inner products
and
will be zero for almost all formula_102.
In the one dimensional case, the support of formula_85 is the interval formula_106. Hence, the integrands of formula_103 and "formula_108" are identically zero whenever formula_109.
Similarly, in the planar case, if formula_110 and formula_84 do not share an edge of the triangulation, then the integrals
and
are both zero.
Matrix form of the problem.
If we write formula_114 and formula_115 then problem (3), taking formula_116 for formula_117, becomes
If we denote by formula_120 and formula_121 the column vectors formula_122 and formula_123, and if we let
and
be matrices whose entries are
and
then we may rephrase (4) as
It is not necessary to assume formula_115. For a general function formula_130, problem (3) with formula_116 for formula_117 becomes actually simpler, since no matrix formula_133 is used,
where formula_135 and formula_136 for formula_117.
As we have discussed before, most of the entries of formula_138 and formula_133 are zero because the basis functions formula_85 have small support. So we now have to solve a linear system in the unknown formula_120 where most of the entries of the matrix formula_138, which we need to invert, are zero.
Such matrices are known as sparse matrices, and there are efficient solvers for such problems (much more efficient than actually inverting the matrix.) In addition, formula_138 is symmetric and positive definite, so a technique such as the conjugate gradient method is favored. For problems that are not too large, sparse LU decompositions and Cholesky decompositions still work well. For instance, MATLAB's backslash operator (which uses sparse LU, sparse Cholesky, and other factorization methods) can be sufficient for meshes with a hundred thousand vertices.
The matrix formula_138 is usually referred to as the stiffness matrix, while the matrix formula_133 is dubbed the mass matrix.
General form of the finite element method.
In general, the finite element method is characterized by the following process.
A separate consideration is the smoothness of the basis functions. For second order elliptic boundary value problems, piecewise polynomial basis function that are merely continuous suffice (i.e., the derivatives are discontinuous.) For higher order partial differential equations, one must use smoother basis functions. For instance, for a fourth order problem such as formula_147, one may use piecewise quadratic basis functions that are formula_148.
Another consideration is the relation of the finite dimensional space formula_56 to its infinite dimensional counterpart, in the examples above formula_57. A conforming element method is one in which the space formula_56 is a subspace of the element space for the continuous problem. The example above is such a method. If this condition is not satisfied, we obtain a nonconforming element method, an example of which is the space of piecewise linear functions over the mesh which are continuous at each edge midpoint. Since these functions are in general discontinuous along the edges, this finite dimensional space is not a subspace of the original formula_57.
Typically, one has an algorithm for taking a given mesh and subdividing it. If the main method for increasing precision is to subdivide the mesh, one has an "h"-method ("h" is customarily the diameter of the largest element in the mesh.) In this manner, if one shows that the error with a grid formula_81 is bounded above by formula_154, for some formula_155 and formula_156, then one has an order "p" method. Under certain hypotheses (for instance, if the domain is convex), a piecewise polynomial of order formula_157 method will have an error of order formula_158.
If instead of making "h" smaller, one increases the degree of the polynomials used in the basis function, one has a "p"-method. If one combines these two refinement types, one obtains an "hp"-method (hp-FEM). In the hp-FEM, the polynomial degrees can vary from element to element. High order methods with large uniform "p" are called spectral finite element methods (SFEM). These are not to be confused with spectral methods.
For vector partial differential equations, the basis functions may take values in formula_159.
Various types of finite element methods.
AEM.
The Applied Element Method, or AEM combines features of both FEM and Discrete element method, or (DEM).
Generalized finite element method.
The Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) uses local spaces consisting of functions, not necessarily polynomials, that reflect the available information on the unknown solution and thus ensure good local approximation. Then a partition of unity is used to “bond” these spaces together to form the approximating subspace. The effectiveness of GFEM has been shown when applied to problems with domains having complicated boundaries, problems with micro-scales, and problems with boundary layers.
hp-FEM.
The hp-FEM combines adaptively, elements with variable size "h" and polynomial degree "p" in order to achieve exceptionally fast, exponential convergence rates.
hpk-FEM.
The hpk-FEM combines adaptively, elements with variable size "h", polynomial degree of the local approximations "p" and global differentiability of the local approximations "(k-1)" in order to achieve best convergence rates.
Comparison to the finite difference method.
The finite difference method (FDM) is an alternative way of approximating solutions of PDEs. The differences between FEM and FDM are:
Generally, FEM is the method of choice in all types of analysis in structural mechanics (i.e. solving for deformation and stresses in solid bodies or dynamics of structures) while computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tends to use FDM or other methods like finite volume method (FVM). CFD problems usually require discretization of the problem into a large number of cells/gridpoints (millions and more), therefore cost of the solution favors simpler, lower order approximation within each cell. This is especially true for 'external flow' problems, like air flow around the car or airplane, or weather simulation.
Application.
A variety of specializations under the umbrella of the mechanical engineering discipline (such as aeronautical, biomechanical, and automotive industries) commonly use integrated FEM in design and development of their products. Several modern FEM packages include specific components such as thermal, electromagnetic, fluid, and structural working environments. In a structural simulation, FEM helps tremendously in producing stiffness and strength visualizations and also in minimizing weight, materials, and costs.
FEM allows detailed visualization of where structures bend or twist, and indicates the distribution of stresses and displacements. FEM software provides a wide range of simulation options for controlling the complexity of both modeling and analysis of a system. Similarly, the desired level of accuracy required and associated computational time requirements can be managed simultaneously to address most engineering applications. FEM allows entire designs to be constructed, refined, and optimized before the design is manufactured.
This powerful design tool has significantly improved both the standard of engineering designs and the methodology of the design process in many industrial applications. The introduction of FEM has substantially decreased the time to take products from concept to the production line. It is primarily through improved initial prototype designs using FEM that testing and development have been accelerated. In summary, benefits of FEM include increased accuracy, enhanced design and better insight into critical design parameters, virtual prototyping, fewer hardware prototypes, a faster and less expensive design cycle, increased productivity, and increased revenue.
FEA has also been proposed to use in stochastic modelling, for numerically solving probability models. See the references list.

2009 LSU Tigers baseball team

The 2009 LSU Tigers baseball team represented Louisiana State University in the NCAA Division I baseball season of 2009. This was the first year for the team in the new Alex Box Stadium.
The 2009 team was coached by Paul Mainieri who was in his third season at LSU. During his first year at LSU, Mainieri's team posted a 29–26–1 record, but failed to make the SEC Tournament or the NCAA Tournament. The team improved during his second year posting a 49–19–1 record, while claiming the SEC Western Division Title, SEC Tournament Championship, and earned the No. 7 National Seed for the 2008 NCAA Tournament. They advanced to the 2008 College World Series.
Previous season.
Paul Mainieri completed his second season as head coach at LSU in 2008. The Tigers won the SEC West division title which earned them the No. 2 seed in the 2008 SEC Baseball Tournament. The Tigers would go on to the win the tournament and secure a spot in the NCAA post-season.
After winning the SEC Tournament, it was announced that LSU was selected as a host site for the 2008 NCAA Tournament for the 18th time in the history of the program and for the first time since the 2005 season. When the full NCAA Tournament bracket was released, LSU was awarded the No. 7 national seed in the tournament, guaranteeing them home field advantage throughout the Super Regionals as long as they won the Regional round. LSU was able to sweep the Baton Rouge regional to secure a spot in the Super Regional round.
UC-Irvine won the Lincoln, NE regional and moved on to the Super Regional to face LSU. After losing the first game, LSU's hopes of a national title were slim going into the 9th inning of game 2. However the Tigers fought back and won the game in comeback fashion by a score of 9-7. LSU wasted no time in game 3 cruising to a 6-0 lead in the 1st inning and eventually winning the game 21-7. The Tigers celebrated the school's 14th trip to the College World Series in what was the last game in the 70-year history of Alex Box Stadium.
LSU faced North Carolina in the first game of the 2008 College World Series. The Tar Heels defeated the Tigers by a score of 8-4, giving LSU its 5th consecutive CWS loss and sending them to the losers bracket. The Tigers faced the Rice Owls next and looked to be headed home with an 0-2 CWS record again after trailing by a score of 5-0, however, in typical Tiger fashion, LSU rallied in the bottom of the 9th inning and won the game on a 3-run double by All-American Blake Dean.
The Tigers then had to face North Carolina again, who had lost to Fresno State. The game started on June 19, 2008 but was delayed by weather and completed on June 20, 2008. The game went into the top of the 9th inning tied 3-3 but a grand slam home run, the first in the College World Series since 2001, gave North Carolina a 7-3 lead. LSU was unable to rally in the bottom of the 9th, and their season was ended.
The 2008 squad compiled and overall record of 49-19-1, which included a 23 game win streak.
Pre-Season.
Coaching Changes.
On June 12, 2008 Terry Rooney was named Head Baseball Coach at the University of Central Florida.
On June 23, 2008 it was announced that Cliff Godwin would join Rooney at Central Florida as an assistant coach.
On June 26, 2008 Paul Mainieri announced the hiring of David Grewe as associate head coach. Grewe previously coached under Mainieri at Notre Dame before leaving in 2005 to become the Head Coach at Michigan State.
It was also announced that Javi Sanchez and Will Davis were promoted. Sanchez was promoted from volunteer assistant to a full-time assistant. He replaces Godwin as the Tigers hitting coach and supervisor of base running. Davis was promoted from Director of Baseball Operations to volunteer assistant.
The final change to Mainieri's staff that was announced on June 26 was the appointment of Kyle Beerbohm. Beerbohm was appointed as an undergraduate student assistant coach, and is a former Tiger pitcher.
On August 20, 2008 it was announced that Ross Brezovsky was hired as the Coordinator of Baseball Operation.
Ranked #1.
On December 22, 2008, the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper released their NCAA Div. 1 Pre-Season Poll with LSU ranked #1. LSU reached a No. 2 ranking in 2008, but had not been ranked No. 1 in quite some time.
On January 22, 2009, LSU was also ranked No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN baseball pre-season poll. They narrowly beat out North Carolina for the top spot.
Game Summaries/Recaps.
Regular season.
February.
Villanova.
LSU began the season with a three game home series against Villanova. The start of baseball season, also marked the opening of a brand new stadium for LSU. The new Alex Box Stadium was completed after the 2008 season, and the Tigers moved into the stadium shortly before the 2009 season kicked off. LSU opened the season on February 20 with a 12-3 victory behind the right arm of Louis Coleman. LSU won game 2 11-1 and completed the sweep winning Sunday's contest 6-3.
Southern.
There was little time to rest after the weekend sweep, as the Southern Jaguars made their first trip to the new "box" on Wednesday February 25. Freshman Chris Matulis got the start for the Tigers. He pitched five strong innings before turning the ball over to the bullpen with a 4-1 lead. LSU was able to hold on to the lead to claim the victory 11-5 to improve to 4-0 on the young season.
Central Florida.
Two former Tiger assistants returned to the "box" for the weekend series against Central Florida, but this time they were in the opposite dugout. Terry Rooney left LSU after the 2008 season to become head coach at UCF and brought former Tiger assistant Cliff Godwin with him. Both coaches were an integral part in LSU's magical run to Omaha during the 2008 season, but UCF had a large hill to climb. The Knights were no match for LSU as the Tigers outscored them 13-4, 11-2, and 16-0 to claim another series sweep.
May.
LSU entered the last month of the regular season with an overall record of 34-11. They were in first place in the SEC Wesern Division and were tied with Georgia for the overall SEC lead with a record of 14-7.
#12 Arkansas.
With Arkansas only a half game back of LSU for the SEC West lead, the weekend series was pivotal for both teams. Unfortunately, both teams had to wait until Saturday to play the first game due to inclement weather. In game 1 of the Saturday double header, Arkansas fell behind early, but was able to overcome the deficit thanks to a dominating pitching effort by Dallas Keuchel that helped Arkansas take game 1, 11–4. Keuchel pitched 8.1 innings and improved to 7-1 overall on the season.
Going into game 2 of the doubleheader, LSU now trailed Arkansas by a half game for the SEC West lead. Much like game 1, the second game was also dominated by pitching, but this time it was LSU pitching that dominated. Senior RHP Louis Coleman was about nab a complete game, 2-hit shutout as LSU won the game 5-0. This placed LSU back at the top of the SEC West standings with a 15–8 record in conference play and 35–13 overall.
The rubber game of the series stayed true to form. LSU was again able to jump out to an early lead, going up 4-0 heading into the bottom of the fourth inning. That would be the last runs LSU plated in the game. Arkansas fought back to bring the score to 4-3 after the 5th, but LSU starter Austin Ross was able to keep the score there through the 6th. Coach Mainieri went to the bullpen after Ross gave up a leadoff single to begin the 7th. Sophomore Chad Jones came in and shut down the Razorbacks. Coach Mainieri went to the bullpen once again at the beginning of the 8th inning, bringing in freshman closer Matty Ott. Ott struck out the side in the 8th and closed out the game with a 1-2-3 9th to preserve the victory and give LSU the series 2–1.
#11 Florida.
Florida traveled to Baton Rouge for another pivotal SEC series. Going into the weekend, both teams were sitting atop their respective divisions and tied for the overall SEC lead with a record of 16-8. In game 1, LSU used a strong outing from Anthony Ranaudo, as well as productive nights at the plate from D.J. LeMahieu and Blake Dean to take game 1 10-1. LSU grabbed the lead in the bottom of the third by scoring two runs and added 4 more in the bottom of the fourth to give Ranaudo a 6-0 lead. Florida scored their lone run in the top of the fifth. The win pushed LSU's mark to 17-8 and gave the Tigers the outright lead in the SEC.
In game 2, LSU received another great pitching performance from senior leader Louis Coleman. Coleman was able to give the Tigers 8 strong innings, allowing only 4 hits, 1 walk, and most importantly 0 runs. LSU plated two runs in the bottom of the first inning to give Coleman the early lead and they never looked back. LSU would score a third run in the bottom of the fourth, and their final run in the bottom of the eighth to win the game 4-0 and clinch another SEC series victory. LSU improved to 18-8 in the SEC, while Florida fell to 16-10.
The final game of the series was much different from the first two. Florida was able to secure its first lead in the series when they scored 3 runs in the top of the third. LSU was able to cut the deficit to 2 runs twice by scoring a run in the bottom of the fourth and fifth, but Florida was able to add more runs scoring 1 in the top of the fifth, 3 in the top of the seventh, and 2 in the top of the eighth. Florida took game 3 by a score of 9-3. The weekend left LSU with an overall record of 38-14 and 18-9 in the SEC. Even with the game 3 loss, LSU was able to remain atop the SEC standings with a half game lead over Alabama entering the last weekend of both SEC and regular season play.
Centenary.
LSU hosted Centenary in the final home game of the regular season, which also marked the completion of their first regular season in the new Alex Box Stadium. The Gents entered the game 28-14 on the season, while LSU entered the game 38-14 overall. LSU got up early scoring 2 runs in the bottom of the 1st inning, and extended their lead to 5-0 after a 3-run home run by freshman CF Mikie Mahtook. Centenary cut the lead to 5-3 in the top of the 5th and made it 5-4 in the top of the 8th, but LSU roared back in the bottom of the 8th to score 7 runs. LSU won the game 12-4 improving to 39-14 on the season. LSU finished the regular season with a 28-9 home record.
Mississippi St..
LSU traveled to Starkville, MS for the final weekend of the regular season. The games for the series followed SEC procedures, and were played Thursday through Saturday, instead of the typical Friday - Sunday weekend series. The SEC established this procedure to give teams more rest between the end of the regular season and the start of the SEC Tournament.
In game 1, LSU jumped out to a quick lead behind a first inning Mikie Mahtook solo home run, but LSU would not hold the lead for long. Mississippi St. tied the game in the bottom of the second inning at 1, before taking the lead 4-1, in the bottom of the third inning. The Bulldogs would hold on to that lead entering the seventh inning, but the LSU offense erupted for 3 runs to tie the game at 4. In the top of the eighth inning, LSU used a wild pitch to score what would be the winning the run. LSU received a gutsy performance by starting pitcher Anthony Ranaudo who pitched 7.1 innings before turning the ball over to freshman closer Matty Ott. Ott finished the game to secure his twelfth save of the season as the Tigers improved to 40-15 overall and 19-8 in SEC play.
A win in game 2 would ensure that LSU would at worst share the SEC regular season title. Much like game 1 though, LSU played catch-up most of the game. The Bulldogs jumped out to an early 3-0 lead after the first inning. They added a single run in the fourth inning and 3 in the sixth inning to take a 7-3 lead into the top of the ninth inning. LSU cut the lead to 7-5, but was down to their final out with pre-season All-America selection Blake Dean at the plate. Dean delivered a two-run home run to tie the game at 7. However, in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Bulldogs were able to take advantage of an error to load the bases before Cody Freeman delivered a game-winning single. The Bulldogs evened the series at 1, with a dramatic 8–7 victory.
In game 3, LSU seemed more determined than ever to secure the SEC title. The Tigers jumped out to a 6-1 lead after two innings and never looked back. The Tigers endured nearly a two-hour rain delay to win the game by the final score of 15-4. The Tigers were led by sophomore outfielder Leon Landry who blasted three home runs in the contest, finishing a 5-6 day at the plate with 7 RBIs. With the win, LSU finished the regular season 41–15 overall, posting a 20–10 mark in conference play. The Ole Miss Rebels also posted a 20–10 mark in conference play, but a series victory over the Rebels earlier in the year gave LSU the No. 1 seed in the 2009 SEC baseball tournament.
SEC Tournament.
The 2009 SEC Baseball Tournament will be held at Regions Park in Hoover, AL from May 20 through May 24. The winner of the 2009 tournament will earn the Southeastern Conference's automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament.

Vanderbilt.
LSU opened SEC Tournament play against Vanderbilt. After 3 scoreless innings for both teams, Vanderbilt catcher Andrew Giobbi hit a solo home run in the top of the 4th to give the Commodores the lead. Vanderbilt would score another run in the top of the 5th, and add two more in the 7th to extend their lead to 4-0. LSU would score their lone run in the bottom of the 7th, but the 4-1 deficit would prove to be too much for the top seeded Tigers. Vanderbilt starter Mike Minor threw a complete game to help the Commordores advance in the winner's bracket. LSU fell into the loser's bracket and would face Alabama in an elimination game the next day.
#18 Alabama.
After completing their first game around 2:00 am CST and losing in extra innings, Alabama had a quick turn around to face LSU in their second game in the tournament with the loser being eliminated. LSU jumped out to 1-0 lead after two innings, but in the top of the 3rd Alabama would score 2 runs to take a 2-1 lead. LSU would fight right back in the bottom half with 4 runs to retake the lead 5-2 and extending it in the 4th by another run. In the seventh inning, up 6-3, LSU would receive a pinch hit 3-run home run from Senior Derek Helenihi which would ultimately prove to be the winning hit. LSU starter Anthony Ranaudo went 7+ innings allowing only 4 runs, before turning the ball over to the bullpen. Freshman closer Matty Ott entered the game in the 8th inning with the bases loaded and two outs. He got Tyler Odle to ground out to end the inning, and would close the game out in the 9th. The Tigers won 9-6 and moved on to face South Carolina in another elimination game. Alabama finished the tournament 0-2.
#25 South Carolina.
After beating Alabama in their first game of the tournament, South Carolina lost by a run after Vanderbilt scored in the top of the 9th inning. Much like their first game against Alabama, their second game also went into the early hours of the next day. The game was very much a pitching duel, with senior ace Louis Coleman on the mound for the Tigers and freshman star Nolan Belcher on the mound for the Gamecocks. Neither team could scratch a run through the first 5 innings, but LSU was able to take advantage of 3 hits in the top of the 6th to take a 2-0 lead. LSU extended the lead in the 8th, scoring 2 more runs, which would complete the scoring for the Tigers. Coleman was able to pitch 8 strong innings allowing a single run in the 8th and earning his 11th win on the season. Freshman Matt Ott once again pitched the 9th to secure the victory for the Tigers, 4-1. As a result of the flipped bracket format, LSU would face Georgia next. LSU would have to beat the Dawgs twice in order to continue playing.
Championship: Vanderbilt.
After defeating Georgia twice on Saturday, LSU earned a spot in the SEC Tournament championship game. LSU would face the team it loss to on day 1 of the tournament, Vanderbilt. The Commodores breezed through the tournament, despite being the No. 8 seed, having won their first three games, 4-1, 9-5, and 11-1. Even though Vanderbilt had not lost yet in the tournament, the championship game is a winner take all format. LSU sent senior LHP Ryan Byrd to the mound, while Vanderbilt countered with Nick Christiani.
LSU wasted no time taking an early lead. Leon Landry opened the game with a lead-off double, and scored 2 batters later. Byrd was able to hold the Commodores offense in check through the first 3 innings only allowing 2 hits, while Christiani settled in as well after Landry's double. In the fourth inning though LSU was able to extend its lead. Another lead-off double by Micah Gibbs, followed by Mikie Mahtook single pushed the scored to 2-0. Mahtook would go on to score as well after a stolen base, infield single, and sac fly to give the Tigers a 3-0 lead after 3.5 innings. The fourth inning was also the last inning for Christiani.
Vanderbilt was able to cut the lead to 3-1 in the bottom half of the fourth off a Steven Liddle solo home run, but the Tigers wasted no time getting the run back. In the 5th, LSU was able to score 2 more runs off a walk, another double by Landry, and sac fly by Blake Dean. LSU now held a 5-1 lead and was in complete control of the game. Each team would go on to score another run in the 7th to make the score 6-2 which would prove to be the final score. Byrd pitched one of the best games of his career. He went 7 innings, allowing 5 hits, 2 earned runs, with 3 strikeouts and 1 walk. If was the first game Byrd has pitched in this year where he factored into the decision. It was the second consecutive SEC Tournament championship for LSU and their record 8th overall.
After the tournament, freshman Mikie Mahtook was named the tournament MVP. In the tournament, Mahtook was 10-22 (.454) with 3 RBIs, 2 runs scored, and 17 put outs. Fellow teammates Blake Dean, Austin Nola, and Daniel Bradshaw were also named to the all-tournament team.

Southern led the game off with a single, followed by a home run to take an early 2-0 lead. Southern held onto the 2-0 lead until LSU was able to plate a single run in the bottom of the 6th. The 2-1 lead would hold only for an inning, as LSU plated 7 runs in the bottom of the seventh to take control of the game.

#6 Rice (Game 1).
Game 1 of the Baton Rouge super regional featured two dominant right-handed pitchers. LSU handed the ball to sophomore Anthony Ranaudo, while Rice sent junior Mike Ojala to the mound. Rice was able to take the lead early off multiple LSU errors. Rice scored 2 unearned runs in the 2nd and another unearned run in the 4th. LSU would finally get on the board in bottom of the 4th, scoring a single run, but Rice got the run back in the 5th on a solo home run by Steven Sultzbaugh. With half the game complete, Rice held onto a 4-1 lead, but the bottom of the 5th proved to be the turning point. Rice pulled Ojala in favor of Taylor Wall with runners on second and third, no outs and a run already across the plate. Wall was brought in to face lefty Ryan Schimpf, but the move proved to be a costly one. Schimpf sent a ball over the right-center fence to give LSU a 5-4 lead. LSU would tack on 2 additional runs to give the Tigers a 7-4 lead after 5 innings, a lead the Tigers would not give up. Rice would score 2 runs in the 8th and 3 in the 9th for a total of 9 on the night, but LSU pushed 2 more runs across in the 7th and 3 in the 8th to win the game 12-9. LSU would need only one more win to advance to Omaha.
#6 Rice (Game 2).
LSU would be the visiting team for the second game of the Baton Rouge super regional. Each team sent their ace to the mound for game 2. LSU was hoping senior RHP Louis Coleman could clinch the super regional for the Tigers while Rice was hoping junior sensation Ryan Berry would extend their season.
LSU would jump out to an early 1-0 lead in the 1st inning capitalizing on a double and two walks. Rice would tie the game in the 3rd on a solo home run by Brock Holt, who also homered the night before. LSU took the lead back in the 4th inning, but Rice again tied the game at 2 in the bottom half of the inning. The 5th inning would once again prove to be the decisive one in the game. LSU would score 2 runs in the top half of the inning to take the lead, a lead they would hold onto the rest of the game. Each team would score a run in the 6th inning, bringing the score to 5-3. That would be it for scoring in this game. Coleman went 8 strong innings, while Berry only made it through the 5th. LSU freshman closer Matty Ott came in to pitch the 9th, and secure the victory. With the win, LSU advances to the 2009 College World Series. It will be LSU’s 15th appearance at the CWS.

A game that matched LSU head coach Paul Mainieri against one of his former assistants Brian O'Connor. Virginia earned a birth in the 2009 College World Series by winning the Fullerton Regional and defeating Ole Miss in the Oxford Super Regional.
Sophomore RHP Anthony Ranaudo opened the game with a 1-2-3 first inning. In the bottom of the first, after getting the first two batters out, Virginia's Danny Hutzen gave up a double to Blake Dean. Micah Gibbs followed Dean's double with an RBI single to give LSU an early 1-0 lead. After both teams failed to score in the second, the Cavaliers were able to take advantage of a couple sacrifices to tie the game at 1. LSU quickly answered in the bottom half of the third scoring 2 runs off 4 hits to regain the lead 3-1. Virginia added a single run in the 4th to close the gap to a run, and took their first ever lead in the CWS in the top of the fifth scoring 2 runs on 4 hits to lead 4-3. Once again though, LSU answered the call. Junior first baseman Sean Ochinko hit a 3-run home run over the left field wall to give LSU a 6-4 lead, a lead they would not give up.
The Cavaliers would cut the lead to 6-5 in the 7th inning, but LSU scored 3 more runs in the 8th to extend the lead to 9-6 which would prove to be the final score. The two teams combined for 28 hits. The win moved LSU into the winner's bracket, where they would square off against SEC rival Arkansas in the second round. The Cavaliers next faced Cal. St. Fullerton in an elimination game.
Finals: No. 4 Texas (Game 1).
LSU and Texas met for only the third time ever in the College World Series with Texas winning the first meeting back in 1987 and LSU winning the second meeting in 2000. The two teams combined for 11 national championships. The 2009 finals marked LSU's first appearance since 2000 in the College World Series finals and the first time they have made the championship series since it became best 2 out of 3. Texas was returning to the finals for the first time since winning it all back in 2005. It was determined that LSU would be the home team for games 1 and 3 via coin flip. LSU was sending senior RHP Louis Coleman to the mound, while Texas countered with sophomore RHP Chance Ruffin.
LSU would jump out to an early 1-0 lead in the top of the 1st inning, as Ryan Schimpf crushed a home run over the left-center field fence. After managing only 1 hit in the first 3 innings off Coleman, Texas would get on the board in the bottom of the 4th with 3 solo home runs to take the lead 3-1. Texas would hold on to that lead for only 1 inning, as Jared Mitchell came through for the Tigers with a 2 RBI triple in the 6th to tie the game at 3. Texas would fight right back in the bottom half of the inning with another solo home run and a wild pitch to retake the lead 5-3. Each team would add a run in the 7th, Texas' another solo home run, to give Texas a 6-4 lead. A lead they would hold on to until the top of the 9th.
Down to the last 3 outs, LSU needed to push 2 runs across to tie the game. Jared Mitchell was first up to bat and quickly grounded out to the shortstop. Junior first baseman Sean Ochinko singled through the left side to bring the tying run to the plate. After the single, Texas would make a pitching change to bring in freshman Taylor Jungmann to face senior third baseman Derek Helenihi. Helenihi who was in a 1-15 slump in the CWS was able to draw a four pitch walk. Freshman Tyler Hanover was brought in to pinch hit, but after getting up 2-0 in the count, Auggie Garrido once again made a pitching change. Brandon Workman was brought in, and would battle to eventually get Hanover to strike out. Down to their last out in game 1 of the finals, LSU's lead off hitter D.J. LeMahieu stepped to the plate with runners on first and second. LeMahieu wasted no time, crushing the first pitch into the left field corner for a 2 RBI double that tied the game. After Ryan Schimpf was intentionally walked, Workman was able to get Blake Dean to fly out to end the top half of the inning. LSU brought in freshman closer Matty Ott to pitch the 9th. After hitting the first batter, Ott was able to record 3 straight outs to send the game into extra innings.
In the top of the 10th, LSU loaded the bases with only 1 out, but was unable to push a run across. Ott pitched the bottom half of the 10th, and once again was able to keep the Texas offense in check. D.J. LeMahieu was up first in the 11th, and drew a lead off walk. After getting Schimpf and Dean to fly out, it appeared Workman was going to get out of the inning. With Gibbs up to bat, LeMahieu took off and stole second. A throwing error by the catcher, Cameron Rupp, allowed LeMahieu to advance to third. Workman would intentionally walk Gibbs to set up the force play. Freshman Mikie Mahtook came to the plate having struck out 3 times earlier in the game, but delivered the game-winning hit. Mahtook single back up the middle scoring LeMahieu to put the Tigers up 7-6. LSU would leave Ott in to pitch his 3rd inning of relief work. Ott struck out the first 2 batters he faced, then got Connor Rowe to ground out to second base to secure the victory for the Tigers.
Finals: No. 4 Texas (Game 2).
With LSU looking to claim their 6th national title and Texas facing elimination, the Longhorns sent freshman Taylor Jungmann to the mound. LSU countered with sophomore Austin Ross who hadn't started a game since game 1 of the Baton Rouge regional. Texas was the visiting team for game 2 and wasted no time taking the lead. The Longhorns pieced together a couple hits to go with a throwing error to take a 1-0 lead after the top of the first inning. They added another run in the second off a solo home run by Preston Clark. The 2-0 lead would be all the Jungmann would need. LSU would push their lone run across in the bottom of the second. After singles by Jared Mitchell and Leon Landry, Derek Helenihi hit a ball up the middle that was misplayed by shortstop Brandon Loy. Mitchell would score an unearned run on the play to cut Texas' lead in half.
Ross was lifted after only pitching 2 innings, but it made no difference. Texas added 3 more runs in the top of third, one coming off a solo home run by Russell Moldenhauer, to extend their lead to 5-1. Those runs ended up being the final scoring for the night for both teams. Texas would finish the game with 12 hits in all, while committing 3 errors. LSU would only manage 5 hits on the evening, and never could take advantage of any opportunities. Longhorn starter, Jungmann, would go on to throw a complete game, striking out 9 and only walking 2. The win forced a rubber match the next for, with the winner of the pivotal game 3 being crowned 2009 NCAA Baseball National Champions.
Finals: No. 4 Texas (Game 3).
After a complete game effort by Jungmann the night before, Texas was hoping sophomore starter Cole Green would be able to put forth a similar effort. LSU countered with sophomore ace Anthony Ranaudo who was making his third start in the College World Series. LSU was once again the home team, and wasted no time taking the early lead. After recording two quick outs, Green hit Blake Dean with a pitch to keep the inning alive. Junior Sean Ochinko was up next and singled through the left side. First round draft pick Jared Mitchell stepped to the plate. With one swing of the bat he gave the Tigers the early lead sending a 3 run home run over the right field fence. In the bottom half of the inning, Ranaudo was able to pitch around 2 singles and a walk to get out of a bases loaded jam with no damage done. In the second inning LSU was extend their lead to 4-0 after piecing together 3 hits in the inning, but the lead would not last long.
Texas was able take advantage of a couple walks and 2 big hits to cut LSU's lead in half, but Texas once again left the bases loaded. After neither team scored in the 4th inning, it was once again Texas' turn to bat in the 5th still down 4-2. A lead off single by Cameron Rupp brought the tying run to the plate. Kevin Keyes delivered sending a 2 run home run over the left field bleachers tying the game at 4 runs apiece.
The top of the 6th inning proved to be the turning point in the game. LSU took advantage of 2 walks, 2 hit batters, an error, and 2 hits to score a total of 5 runs. LSU now held a 9-4 lead, a lead they would not let go of. LSU starter Anthony Ranaudo pitched 5.1 innings, giving up 8 hits, 4 runs, and 5 walks, but still got the win to improve his record to 12-3 on the season. Sophomore Chad Jones pitched 1.2 hitless innings while striking out 2 batters. LSU would extend their lead to 10-4 after a double, single, and sac fly in the inning. Coach Mainieri brought in senior Louis Coleman to pitch the 8th inning. Coleman was able to work around a 1 out double to get out of the inning without giving up a run. LSU added another run in the 9th off a solo home run by Ochinko to extend the lead to 11-4. Coleman was brought back out to finish the game off. After a lead off walk, Coleman struck out the side to secure the victory.
The victory marks the 6th national championship for LSU baseball, the first since 2000. It was also the first championship for head coach Paul Mainieri. LSU finished the season 56-17.

Dr. Tricia Striano researches early social cognition in infancy, using brain and 
behavioral measures. Her research is essential to understanding the ontogenetic pathways that give rise 
to typical and atypical social cognitive development. 
Dr. Striano's research shows that infants' developments include the ability to identify relevant social cues directed at 
the self versus others (i.e., dyadic relations), the capacity to detect the 
relevance of social cues directed at the environment (i.e., triadic relations), 
and the ability to use this social information to learn.

Game summary.
1st Half.
Cork got off to a great start when kick returner David Barry took the opening kick-off back deep into Vikings territory. The Admirals threatened to score, but were stopped on the 15-yard line by the Vikings defense. The Admirals defense held the Vikings offence on their very first possession of the game, forcing them to punt the ball. The key play for the Admirals on the ensuing possession was a 40 yard draw play by fullback Alain Pezeron which got them a first and goal on the Vikings 3-yard line. Two plays later, Cork’s Keith O’Callaghan scored from 3 yards out, following the linemen to the goal line. Pezeron got the 2-point conversion to make the score 8-0 Admirals.
The Vikings got back into the game shortly afterwards. Quarterback Chris Bassitt led them down field on helped by running backs Andrew Gordon and Seamus Hogan, before Hogan scored a touchdown on a 5-yard run up the middle. Bassitt got the 2-point conversion to level the scores at 8-8. Both defenses dominated the second quarter in which there were a number of good defensive plays on both sides of the ball. The Vikings defenders Declan O’Donnell, Damien Laffan and Alan O’Carroll made a number of key tackles. On the other side of the ball, the Admirals defensive line of Marcus Gates, Ross McCullough and Barry Rea forced some tackles for loss. With less than 5 minutes to go to half time, Vikings' cornerback Daniel Smith got the first turnover of the day when he picked off a pass intended for Dominic MacHale. However, Vikings' kicker Adrian Garvey missed a field goal and the score remained 8-8 until the half.
2nd Half.
The second turnover of the game came on the very first play from scrimmage after half time. Admirals linebacker Martin Mulvey recovered an Andrew Gordon fumble to give the Admirals the ball on the Vikings 20-yard line. The Admirals scored a touchdown shortly afterwards on a pass from David Lomasney to receiver Dominic MacHale to give them a 14-8 lead. The Vikings then drove into scoring range getting a 1st and goal on the Admirals 5-yard line. However, a defensive stand by the Admirals prevented a score after they stopped the Vikings on 4th down. The Vikings defense then ensured that their offense got the ball back in good field position when they forced the Admirals to punt after not picking up much yardage on the ensuing possession. This gave the Vikings the ball at midfield and, through runs by Bassitt and Gordon, they got to the 10-yard line. Then Seamus Hogan scored his second touchdown, running up the middle on a draw play and pushing the ball over the goal line as Admirals defenders attempted to tackle him. Adrian Garvey's single point conversion gave the Vikings a one point lead.
The Vikings defense stopped the Cork Admirals again, forcing them to punt the ball early in the 4th quarter. This time the Vikings caught the Admirals' defense off guard as they went to the air with a long pass from Bassitt to receiver Marc Ashworth who was stopped on the Admirals 5-yard line. On the next play, game MVP Seamus Hogan sealed the award with his third touchdown of the day, as he bounced his run to the right and found the corner of the endzone, which was also converted to give the Vikings a 22-14 lead. However, the game was far from over. Admirals quarterback David Lomasney led the Admirals on a long drive, during which O’Callaghan and Pezeron both contributed big yardage. After Seamus Hogan stopped O’Callaghan just short of the endzone, the Admirals looked like they would be sending the game into overtime with a first down on the Vikings 2-yard line. However, the Vikings defense came up with their best defensive performance of the afternoon and held them out on all four downs. The Vikings then tried to run out the clock on the ensuing possession, but were forced to punt after only picking up one first down. With just over 2 minutes remaining, Daniel Smith got off a great punt, pinning the Admirals back inside their own half. But the Admirals still had more than enough time to score. They picked up a couple of first downs, but were stopped on 4th down with less than 30 seconds remaining on the clock as they tried to convert with a Statue of Liberty play to Alan Pezeron. The Vikings then kneeled down to win their first ever Shamrock Bowl, 22-14.

She is a member in good standing of a loose knit community of artists practicing Pop Surreal, Lowbrow, or, as Robert Williams defines it, "cartoon-tainted abstract surrealism." She typically paints upon treated wooden panel, incorporating the grain of the wood into the painting. Her style integrates both narrative and figurative styles with the mystic.
Sol's works are characterized by young maidens in dream-like nature settings with oversized or sometimes fanciful creatures. One gets a sense that the girls are interacting with the animals as mythic partners or perhaps "familiars." There is no indication that these animals are pets; rather friends or perhaps partners. The exotic landscapes include plants, impossible trees, mist & fog, clouds, flowers, and rolling hills. With a muted pallet of pastels and washed out grays; her style is influenced by folk-art, contemporary illustration, manga, and modern design.
Sol has named Range Murata and Kay Nielsen among others as inspirations for her work.

Wings 2 and 3 of the roundhouse date from this time; since then they have just been extended. The workshop building, too, dates from the 1800s, as well as the floor plan of the first recorded engine shed. The facility was regularly expanded and its use adapted in the course of time up to 1937. The last expansion was carried out from 1935 to 1937, when the locomotive shed was lengthened and a 20 metre turntable installed.
A major event in its history were the air attacks during the Second World War in 1944 and 1945, when large parts of the shed were destroyed. Only wings 2 and 3 of the roundhouse were spared, as well as the workshop building and the water tower. The facility was rebuilt and in places modernised in the years up to 1949.
For a short period the locomotive shed experienced new life as it was allocated V 100 diesel locomotives, VT 98 railbuses and ETA 150 accumulator cars. By 1966 the routine stabling of steam locomotives had ended. With the electrification of the Ries Railway ("Riesbahn"), Donauwörth–Aalen, and the Danube Valley Railway ("Donautalbahn"), Neuoffingen–Ingolstadt many of the diesel engines were dispensable, so that in 1982 the locomotive shed was closed as an independent facility. The closure of the branch lines radiating from Nördlingen did one more thing to return peace to the entire station at Nördlingen. In 1985 the railway maintenance division was moved out and operations as a satellite of Augsburg locomotive shed were ceased.
Establishment of the museum.
In autumn 1985 the Bavarian Railway Museum took over the partially dismantled facilities. Since then, the museum has painstakingly attempted to equip it as a complete locomotive shed again. Several tracks had to be relaid and all the locomotive shed roads connected to the turntable. In addition two water cranes were re-installed. In the near future a coaling facility should also be brought into operation.
Current museum railway operations.
The Bavarian Railway Museum works the route to Gunzenhausen and the section from Nördlingen to Feuchtwangen on the line to Dombühl with historical vehicles. Its daughter company, "BayernBahn Betriebsgesellschaft mbH", is responsible for the maintenance of the line to Dombühl rented from the Deutsche Bahn as well as the operation of museum vehicles on special trains, but also for other services, for example in maintenance of way trains. In addition, for several years impressive goods trains have been hauled in the Nördlingen area e.g. for wood and timber products. For this Class V 100 und V 60 diesel locomotives are usually used, but sometimes the museum's steam engines are engaged as well.

Majete Game Reserve

Majete Game Reserve is a national game reserve in Malawi. The reserve lies a few miles north of Chikwawa, with the Shire River forming its eastern boundary. The park consists of approximately 70,000 hectares of land and contains about 4,000 animals, including elephant, eland, zebra, leopard, baboons, many species of monkeys, and warthogs. Large numbers of hippos and crocodiles can be found in streams and along the banks of the Shire River. In the 1980s, Majete suffered from poaching and deforestation. The elephant herds that used to be common in the area have largely vanished. Many animals have been re-introduced, including lions, black rhinos, and leopards. The park is now protected by a 142 km fence and may be the best place in Malawi to see the Big 5 animals. Majete is very dry and hot in the summer, and several man-made watering holes have been constructed to maintain the wildlife population.
Kapachira Falls on the Shire River is located near the park. David Livingstone's 1859 Zambezi Expedition came up the Shire but were unable to proceed beyond the falls. One of Livingstone's companions is buried in a well-kept grave near a prominent baobab tree not far from the Majete.

Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve

Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve is a national game reserve in Malawi.
In contrast to the Nyika National Park on the Nyika Plateau much of Vwaza is located on low lying flat ground although the eastern side of the park is hilly. It is located to the southeast of the plateau and to the north of the floodplains of South Rukuru River and covers an area of 1,000 km².
The park is characterised by Mopane and Miombo woodland and marshy wetlands which attracts a significant number of birds to the reserve.
Vwaza Marsh Game Reserve is rarely visited by many, largely due to poor road conditions and difficult terrain and inaccessibility.
The variation in animal number of species type may vary from season to season as they cross the border with the North Luangwa National Park in Zambia. Typically the reserve has large herds of buffalo and elephants, and a large variety of antelope including roan, greater kudu, Lichtenstein's hartebeest, eland and impala.
Moses the orphaned elephant that now is at Jumbo Foundation elephant orphantage in Lilongwe Malawi, was rescued by rangers at Vwaza Marsh in the South Rukuru river. [http://www.jumbofoundation.com]
Notable birdlife include Goliath Herons, Openbill Storks and the rare White-winged Starling. Lake Kazuni is located in the reserve and supports a notable hippo population.

<doc id="18234877" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18234877" title="Step therapy">
Step therapy

In managed medical care step therapy is an approach to prescription intended to control the costs and risks posed by prescription drugs. The practice begins medication for a medical condition with the most cost-effective and safest drug therapy and progresses to other more costly or risky therapies only if necessary. Also called step protocol, a fail first requirement, or a prior authorization requirement. 
Recent trends in prescription drug prices in the United States has led to an increased pressure on health care providers to keep down the cost of prescription medication while maintaining high levels of availability to the patient. The use of generic drugs when possible allows health care plans to pursue both of these goals effectively. Physicians and managed care providers may disagree on the proper step therapy and patients are encouraged to become knowledgeable in managing their own care. 
Opponents.
Opponents such as Fail First Hurts, have detailed the pitfalls of step therapy. "Fail First is used by health insurers to control costs. It is time-consuming from a physician and patient standpoint, is more expensive from a direct and indirect out-of-pocket cost perspective, denies patients the drugs they need when they need them, and allows payers to practice medicine without a license.
