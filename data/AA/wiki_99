1st Raider/Paratrooper Brigade (Greece)

The 1st Raider/Paratrooper Brigade (, "1 TAXKD-AL - 1 Taxiarhia Katadromon-Alexiptotiston"), is a brigade-sized formation of elite Greek light infantry and special operations forces. The formation is more commonly referred to as the Raider Forces (), and a soldier belonging to the Brigade a Raider ().
History.
Sacred Company.
The nucleus of the Raider units was the Sacred Company ("Ieros Lochos"), a Free Greek unit of commandos attached to the Allied 1st Special Air Service (1 SAS) Brigade during the Second World War. Its members consisted of mainly officers and NCOs who had fled to North Africa after the fall of Greece to Axis forces. After its formation in 1942, the Sacred Company, also known as the Sacred Band, along with a unit of Free French troops and British commandos, formed the basis of L Detachment, a component of the SAS which specialised in hit-and-run raids on Axis airfields, ports and fuel dumps throughout North Africa.
The Sacred Company was later transferred to the Greek theatre of operations, where they recaptured several eastern Aegean islands from Axis forces. After the liberation of Greece from German occupation, a proposal was made for the reformation of the Hellenic Armed Forces under British guidance. This proposal included the establishment of a small, highly trained, special warfare unit.
LOK.
When the Greek Civil War broke out in 1946, the Greek Government decided to form a special warfare unit, primarily to help Greek royalist and British forces capture territory which was still in the hands of communist-inspired guerrillas. The Mountain Raider Companies or LOK (, "Lochoi Oreinōn Katadromōn"), were formed on 20 January 1947 and began operations almost immediately in Greece's mountainous terrain. Beta Raider Squadron was formed at Vouliagmeni, Athens in August 1947 and took part in Civil War operations in Thessaly, Central Greece, Epirus, West Macedonia and Euboea. Delta Raider Squadron was established at the port city of Volos, Thessaly in December 1947 and operated in all regions of Greece during the Civil War. Epsilon Raider Squadron was formed in April 1949 and took part in Civil War operations until December 1949. By 1949, the LOK squadrons were so successful against the communist insurgents that the Raider Forces Command was expanded to two brigades. Gamma Raider Squadron, also formed in 1949, was redesignated as an amphibious-capable unit in 1963, while Alpha Raider Squadron, disbanded at the end of the Civil War, was reactivated in 1968, and later re-formed as an amphibious unit in 1974, after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
In the late 1960s, the Greek Central Intelligence Service (KYP), and the CIA became secretly involved with training and arming the "Lokatzides". A tool of the KYP and CIA, a LOK detachment played a part in the coup d'état of 1967 by storming and securing the Army General Staff buildings at Cholargos, Athens.
Raider Forces.
After the fall of the Papadopoulos regime, and the establishment of a democratic republic in 1975, the LOK were dismantled and re-formed as the Raider Forces (), and placed under the command of the Hellenic Army's Special Forces Command ().
A further restructuring of the Greek Army in 1996 saw the amalgamation of all Raider Forces regiments into the current Brigade formation.
Uniform and unit insignia.
1st Raider/Paratrooper Brigade soldiers wear the standard-issue "Greek Lizard" camouflage BDUs of the Hellenic Army. Members of the Special Paratrooper Unit (ETA) and Z' MAK may occasionally wear non-standard issue BDUs, depending on mission requirements.
All members of the Brigade wear the unit insignia depicting a winged sword, representative of the "deadly, silent and swift" nature of special forces operations. A scroll runs across the sword and wings with the motto Who Dares Wins ( - "O Tolmon Nika"), a tribute to the Free Greek Special Forces that served with the 1 SAS Brigade during World War II. The unit flash is emblazoned with ΔΥΝΑΜΕΙΣ ΚΑΤΑΔΡΟΜΩΝ (Raider Forces). While on operation, low-visibility patches are worn.
All Raiders wear the green beret with the national emblem on the left.
Structure.
Force Delta.
Members of ETA (the HALO/HAHO-qualified Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) unit) and Ζ΄ ΜΑΚ, the Amphibious reconnaissance formation, are all professional NCOs and Officers. They are the Brigade's contribution to the Defence Ministry's DESAA (Diakladiko Epiheirisiako Stratigeio Amesis Antidrasis), the "Multi-Branch Operational Rapid Response Command", along with the Hellenic Navy's DYK, and the Hellenic Air Force's 31 MEE. The formation is also known as Force Delta (Dynami Delta).

Cicilia and Clorinda

Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms is a 17th-century closet drama, a two-part, ten-Act tragicomedy by Thomas Killigrew. The work was composed in Italy c. 1650–51, and first published in 1664.
Genre and source.
Like the majority of Killigrew's plays — stage plays or closet dramas — "Cicilia and Clorinda" is cast in the mode of tragicomedy, with its highly-colored elements of romance, and limited realism. The play may be more interpreted and judged in the romance tradition than in the dramatic; the work is "a means of providing the matter of romance in an alternative form."
Killigrew employed the closet-drama form to work with material that would have met strong resistance on the public stage of his time. "Cicilia and Clorinda" is in part an exploration of the idea of the Amazon or "warrior woman" (he coined the term "Heroickess"). When Killigrew wrote the work, women were not yet allowed to appear onstage in England.
In writing the work, Killigrew was influenced by "Artamène, ou Le Grand Cyrus", by Madeleine and Georges de Scudéry. His characters Amadeo, Lucius, and Manlius are versions of the French novel's Aglatidas, Artabes, and Megabises (Part 1, Book 3).
Publication.
Both parts of "Cicilia and Clorinda" were first printed in "Comedies and Tragedies", the collected edition of Killigrew's plays issued by Henry Herringman in 1664. The collected edition specifies that "Part 1" was written in Turin, and "Part 2" in Florence, during Killigrew's years of exile in the English Commonwealth period. "Part 1" is dedicated to Lady Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton, and "Part 2" is dedicated to Lady Dorothy Sidney, Countess of Sunderland.
Carew and Crofts.
Killigrew includes the Thomas Carew poem "Song of Jealousy" in "Cicilia and Clorinda Part 2", Act V scene ii, where it concludes the play. According to Killigrew, Carew wrote the poem in 1633, in response to a dispute between Killigrew and Cecilia Crofts, then a maid of honor to Queen Henrietta Maria and later Killigrew's first wife (1636–38). Carew also wrote a poem, "The morning stormy," in celebration of the Killigrew/Crofts wedding.
In addition to "Cicilia and Clorinda", Killigrew employs his first wife's name for the heroine of his early play "The Princess".
Critical scrutiny.
Often neglected by critics and readers, English closet dramas of the 17th century began to claim a greater share of critical attention toward the end of the 20th century. Margaret Cavendish has been the main beneficiary of this shift in focus, though writers like Killigrew and works like "Cicilia and Clorinda" have also benefitted.

U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D.

"U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D." is a popular song from the musical "Starlight Express", with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Richard Stilgoe. It is performed by Dinah the Dining Car, after being dumped by her macho boyfriend, Greaseball. It is a parody of the Tammy Wynette song, "D-I-V-O-R-C-E."
Lyrics.
The lyrics are packed with humour. The song starts with Dinah describing to her friends that "I've been..." before confessing that she "can't say the word." So she spells it out for them instead. She then goes on to explain how she can't stop "C.R.Y.I.N.G." She announces that she will have her "R.E.V.E.N.G.E." on Greaseball, who she now sees as a complete "B.A.S.T.A.R.D."
Music.
Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the song in the key of B flat major. It is played in a country and western style.
Thematic value.
The song is reprised when Greaseball can't find the word to apologise to Dinah. She recommends he spell it instead, so (being a bit of a dunce) he tells her he is "S.O.R.R.R.Y."
History.
Starlight Express has had many revisions made to the costumes, make-up, choreography, wigs, set, characters and musical numbers. Of all the notable musical numbers in Starlight Express, U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D (along with 'Right Place, Right Time') has had no revision made to the number at all.

Frederick Henry Yates

Frederick Henry Yates (4 February 1797, London – 21 June 1842, 4 Mornington Crescent) was an English actor and theatre manager.
Life.
As the youngest son of Thomas Yates, a tobacco manufacturer, of Thames Street and Russell Square, Frederick was educated at a preparatory school at Winchmore Hill and at Charterhouse School (at the former meeting John Reeve, whom he would later work with) before joining the commissariat department. In that job he was with Wellington in the Peninsular War and possibly at the battle of Waterloo.
When peace came, he met Charles Mathews at a fancy ball before accompanying him on a trip to France in winter 1817/18 and becoming an actor on his advice (his first stage appearance was in Boulogne during the trip). He then appeared at Edinburgh before making his London debut on 7 November 1818 at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, where he remained until 1824/25 when he and Daniel Terry bought the Adelphi Theatre.

<doc id="18552288" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18552288" title="HOTA">
HOTA

HOTA is an acronym for Home Office Type Approval, a testing and certification process by the Home Office in the United Kingdom that speed cameras must pass before evidence from them can be admissible in UK courts by way of certification in accordance with Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 (RTOA) (Amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991). It is a misnomer that speed enforcement devices must be Home Office Type Approved before they may be deployed on public roads to gather evidence of speeding offences however if the device does not have UK Type Approval then the evidence from the device is not able to be certified but must be adduced by a witness and perhaps an expert witness who is able to adduce evidence of its accuracy. The RTOA route via Section 20 certification is a clear advantage over the unapproved equipment route to court.
The Type Approval of devices that meet the definitions or more accurately "prescriptions" of types of devices in Statutory Instruments (forms of secondary legislation) is carried out by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch of the UK Home Office in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) who meet in committee 3 or 4 times per year to discuss the testing of equipment in the process. 
There are two components to the certification process:
Only when both parts of the testing are completed and the equipment fully meets the specifications in the relevant HOSDB Speedmeter Handbook will the equipment be recommended to the Secretary of State to be awarded UK Type Approval. Once recommended an administrative process takes place between the Home Office and the UK manufacturer or distributing agent in which a contract (Type Approval Agreement) is exchanged and agreed between both parties. When that contract is signed then a Type Approval Certificate is signed by a minister at the Home Office; the equipment can then be used to produce certifiable evidence, evidence of speeding that is admissible in UK courts without the support of a witness. There is no requirement to place the Type Approval Agreement or Certificate of Type Approval before Parliament because the Statutory Instrument defining the "type" of equipment has already been fully ratified by both Houses of Parliament.
In engineering terms, HOTA is poor. The pass mark, the Speedmeter Handbook, specifically requires a car and not other vehicle types, with no distance variation tested, weather types specified, vehicle colour or reflectivity evaluation, no multiple vehicles in field of view, no road furniture and no evaluation of hand movements; variations that can occur in operational use. The testing is not carried out by the Home Office, but by a subcontractor paid for by the manufacturer. The accuracy limits are sufficiently poor that the ACPO RPET Committee argued against the introduction of driver penalties that varied according to the degree of speeding.

Mysore Peta

Mysore Peta ("Peta" is a Kannada word which means Turban in English) is the traditional indigenous attire worn by the erstwhile Kings of Mysore, called the Wodeyars (1399 to 1947), of the Kingdom of Mysore. Wodeyars wore a richly bejeweled turban made of silk and jari (gold threaded lace) to match with colorful dresses as part of the royal dress.
Administrators under the King, such as the Dewans' (Prime Minister appointed by the King) and other senior officials who swayed considerable power in matters of state administration also doffed the Mysore Peta.
After India became independent in 1947 and the princely state merged with the Indian union, the traditional Mysore peta has been retained as a symbol of heritage and cultural antecedents and distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysore Peta with a shawl in formal functions.
Ancient tradition.
Kings wore the traditional Mysore Peta as headgear during the Durbar (court of Indian or princley state's kings) time or in a ceremonial procession during the Dassara celebrations and or during joint ceremonial parades with the visiting royal dignitaries from foreign countries.
It was expected that the men attending King's court wore the conventional attire called the durbar dress which comprised a black long coat with white trousers and a compulsory Mysore Peta (turban).
Design.
The attractive and colorful turban is a headdress made up of long scarf–like single piece of cloth made of silk or cotton wound round the head cap and is often decorated with jari border (golden or silver laces) and beautiful metal pendants that adds to its glory and grandeur.
In the early 1930s, the "Imperial Hatworks" located in heritage buildings called the Hatworks Boulevard (150 years old history), at No. 32, Cunningham Road, Bangalore, used to make the "pretied Mysore peta" for the Maharajah of Mysore. This place was owned by Manackjee who had set up shop after studying hatmaking in the UK. But this shop closed down a few years after Manackjee's death in 1959. The old–world ambiance of the Hatworks Boulevard has been restored as a minor tourist place with a boutique, French spa, cafe–and–pastry shop, an art gallery (through a tie–up with Crimson Art Gallery), a home furnishing store, an art costume jewellery store and a shop selling custom–made marble pieces.
Social and religious tradition.
The people of the Mysore district and the Kodagu district feel proud to wear turbans called Mysore peta. In Kodagu district, it is part of the traditional dress worn on special occasions such as marriages. Men wear a turban during religious ceremonies to portray respect and reverence towards the Supreme Being.Distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysore Peta in formal functions.
Even to this day bridegrooms in Southern Karnataka wear the Mysore Peta during the rituals associated with the marriage.
University Convocation cap.
Convocation caps are adorned by students and faculty during convocation ceremonies. This practice has been changed by the Inter–University Board (IUB) of Karnataka, which has ruled that students passing out of the nine universities in Karnataka shall no longer wear the traditional black cap – the mortarboard (as it was considered a British legacy) - during their proud moments. Instead, universities have been given the option of using the traditional Mysore Peta.
The academic cap or square, commonly known as the "mortarboard", a symbol of the academia is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top centre of the board. The tassel is made of a cluster of silk threads, which are fastened by a button at one end and fixed at the centre of the headpiece. In Karnataka University Convocation, students have now the option to wear the Karnataka's traditional Mysore peta, a turban made of silk or cotton cloth with jari tied to the head in a traditional way (tied Mysore petas or turbans are readily marketed for the purpose in most major cities of the state).

The Concave football boot is a special boot designed to increase the 'sweet spot' (the area of the boot that makes contact with the ball) by approximately four times. It has evolved the games of Australian Football League, Soccer and Rugby League. Independent testing at Deakin University has shown the boot increases power by between 8-15% and provides increased accuracy with a smaller margin of error. Concave also designed this new boot to protect the metatarsal bones. The upper of the boot contains a flexible layer of TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethane) and a reinforced cushioning foam composite called "MetaGuard". Research and development was independently conducted by Monash University and Invetech Systems Pty. Ltd. in Australia. Strategic design thinking and industrial design of the concave device and each year’s boot model range was undertaken by Melbourne based design group, CobaltNiche who also created the brand design and related marketing material. The Concave company is globally oriented with offices in Liverpool and Melbourne.
Investors and endorsements.
Concave has a number of high-profile investors and former professional footballers involved including former Liverpool F. C. manager Kenny Dalglish and a number of former Australian football representatives including Kevin Muscat, Paul Trimboli, Michael Petersen, Oscar Crino, Warren Spink and Alistair Edwards.

Krasnaya Gorka fort

Krasnaya Gorka (Красная Горка meaning red Hill) is a coastal artillery fortress west of Lomonosov, Russia on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, opposite Kotlin Island and the Baltic Fleet's base at Kronstadt. The nearest settlement is Lebyazhye (Лебяжье).
History.
The fort was established in the 18th Century and substantially modernised in the late 19th – early 20th century with the installation of 12 inch guns in concrete casemates. There is an outlying fort called "Seraya Loshad" (Grey Horse) containing smaller guns. 
The fort was armed with:
The work was completed in 1914.
During the Russian Civil War the fort helped defend the city of Petrograd. In June 1919 the garrison mutinied against the Bolshevik regime but this revolt was suppressed. Though the Estonian 1st Division and the British Royal Navy actively supported the White Russian Northern Corps in the area their attacks were not able to aid the mutineers.
Later in autumn 1919 the forts were unsuccessfully attacked by the Estonian 1st Division supported by bombardment by HMS "Erebus". In 1921 the guns of the fort bombarded Kronstadt during the rebellion. During World War II the fort played a vital part in defending the Siege of Leningrad and maintaining the Oranienbaum Bridgehead. The fort was decommissioned in 1960 and partially demolished. The local authorities of the St Petersburg region are discussing whether to convert the site into a military museum.

A few days previously, in a bloodless coup, Lansana had placed Stevens, the All People's Congress (APC) candidate and Mayor of Freetown, under house arrest and declared martial law; this had been done only hours after Siaka Stevens had been declared the new prime minister by Sierra Leone Governor General Henry Josiah Lightfoot Boston, following closely contested general elections. Lansana acted on the grounds that the determination of office should await the election of the tribal representatives to the house. 
The NRC was overthrown in April 1968 by a group of military officers who called themselves the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement (ACRM), led by Brigadier John Amadu Bangura. The ACRM imprisoned senior NRC members, restored the constitution and reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister.

Marie of Valois, Duchess of Calabria

Marie of Valois (1309–1332) was the eldest daughter of Charles of Valois by his third wife Mahaut of Châtillon. She was a member of the House of Valois. One of her five children was Queen Joanna I of Naples.
Marriage.
Marie married Charles, Duke of Calabria, in 1323 when she was only fourteen years of age. Charles married her after the death of his first wife, Catherine of Habsburg, who had died without bearing Charles any children. Marie earned the gratitude of the genteel women in Florence when she persuaded her husband to allow them to wear what they could afford.
Charles and Marie had five children:
Her eldest surviving daughter, Joanna, became Queen of Naples. Her youngest daughter, Maria, born six months after Charles' death, became the Countess of Alba.
Marie's husband died in 1328 and she never remarried. She died in 1332 at the age of 23. Her mother and two sisters outlived her.

South Petherton

South Petherton is a small country town and civil parish on the River Parrett in the South Somerset district of Somerset, England. It is east of Ilminster and north west of Crewkerne. It had a population of 3,367 in 2011. The parish includes the hamlets of Yeabridge, Compton-Durville, South Harp, and Over Stratton, and is approximately from East Lambrook, Martock and Lopen.
It is distinctive for the traditional hamstone construction of many of its buildings. In 2005 South Petherton was awarded ‘Somerset Village of the Year’ in a national competition.
History.
The town's name may come from the Old English word "Pared" meaning boundary and the Saxon word "ton" meaning settlement, forming ’Paredton’.
A site on Lightgate Road, north of the present town, has produced Iron Age occupation material, though archaeological evidence of any structures have not yet been discovered. Roman material, mostly consisting of coins, has also been discovered locally and, as it is only from the Fosse Way, roman occupation is likely, although it may have been abandoned between the 4th and 8th centuries.
The Saxon Chronicle of 680 refers to a major battle on the site of the village and the Saxon Ine of Wessex of the Kingdom of Wessex built a palace on present day Silver Street.
A large royal estate of South Petherton was created and the Saxon settlement, "Sudperetone" (the southern tun on the Parrett), included a minster church, a royal palace and a short-lived 11th century mint. Most of the royal estate passed directly to William the Conqueror and was still a possession of the Crown in 1086. The parish was part of the South Petherton Hundred. Part of the estate was also held by Bruton Abbey from the 12th century until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, then becoming known as the manor of Hele. In 1213 a royal warrant by King John was granted for a market and fair, but by 1243 the main manor had been granted away from the Crown under Henry II and by 1243 South Petherton manor was owned outright by the Daubeney family, who continued to hold it until the late 15th century, the family dying out after Henry Daubeney acquired the earldom of Bridgwater and then failed to produce an heir to succeed him.
The manor reverted to the Crown in 1553, before passing into the ownership of Charles Arundell (d. 1587), who left it to his brother Matthew Arundell, in whose family it remained until 1792, when it was sold to John Baker Edmonds. Edmonds also acquired the rectory estate of South Petherton (known also as the manor of Hele), which had had a complicated history of ownership, including purchase in 1753 by Henry Hele, a successful physician from Salisbury.
Another estate (known as the Manor of Wigborough) was shared by members of the Brome Family from 1581 to 1615, when it passed to the family of Hele of Flete (unconnected to the Henry Hele referred to above) who held it for most of the 17th century.
During the English Civil War troops from both sides occupied the town during 1644 and 1645. The town also had a role in the Monmouth rebellion of 1680 and two townsmen were among those who prosecuted in the Bloody Assizes.
It was also recently discovered that South Petherton was, during the 17th century, one of the main centres of bronze cauldron and skillet production. These cooking vessels were used all over the UK.
In 1947 a 17th-century house on West Street was converted into the Under-Sheriff's Office, and is now offices for a law firm founded in 1749.
Governance.
As a civil parish, South Petherton has its own parish council with responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town is part of the South Somerset local government district within the wider Somerset County Council.
Yeovil is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The constituency covers the towns of Yeovil, Chard, Crewkerne and Ilminster in Somerset. Until 1983 Somerset was split into four constituencies and Yeovil constituency also contained the towns of Ilchester, Martock and Somerton but they were moved into the newly created constituency of Somerton and Frome. From the next election, Yeovil constituency will contain Ilchester once again to equalise the populations of the Somerset constituencies. The Boundary Commission for England estimate the electorate of Yeovil constituency after the pending boundary changes to be 77,049. The current MP is David Laws, a member of the Liberal Democrats.
Residents of South Petherton also form part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.
Geography.
South Petherton is situated between the Devon hills to the west, the flat wetland area of the Somerset Levels and Moors to the north, and the hills of Dorset to the south.
It lies on low lying undulating land of Yeovil Sands at the foot of a limestone ridge, which has been quarried for Petherton stone, and for sands and clays suitable for brick and tile making.
Climate.
Along with the rest of South West England, South Petherton has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.
Economy.
Agriculture has traditionally been an important local industry, although South Petherton has also been a centre for glove making, cider production and other cottage industries at various points in its history.
Cloth manufacture, continued into the late 18th and 19th century although this was largely replaced by sailcloth and then leather working. The importance of this industry can be seen by the number of mills which remain including; the former flax mill or granary in Hayes End, Joylers Mill, Shutlers Mill, and the former flax mill immediately north of Flaxdrayton Farmhouse.
Landmarks.
In Silver Street is a 14th-century manor house. It was restored in the 19th century and nicknamed 'King Ina's Palace'.
The 15th or 16th century Wigborough Manor House was never completed to its original plans and has subsequently been modified many times.
Approximately from the town is East Lambrook Manor Gardens created by Margery Fish who was known as the 'Leading Lady of Gardening' from the 1950s until her death in 1969. It holds the national collection of geraniums, and a collection of snowdrops.
The "David Hall" is a local social centre run by the Petherton Arts Trust, a non-profit making organisation formed in 1986 and registered as a charity in 1990. There is also the "Blake Hall" which has a social club downstairs and a hall upstairs where a market is held on the first Sunday of every month, as well as various other activities.
Health and Education.
During 2007 Somerset Primary Care Trust consulted local residents about proposals for the redevelopment of South Petherton Community Hospital, which provides Out Patient Assessment and Reablement services. In March 2012, the new hospital was opened by Sophie, Countess of Wessex.
Education is provided within the town by two nurseries for pre-school children, an infants’ school (ages 5–7) and a junior school (ages 7–11). The nearest secondary schools are in Stoke-sub-Hamdon (Stanchester Community School), Crewkerne (Wadham) and Huish Episcopi (Huish Episcopi School).
Transport.
South Petherton is located close to the A303 main road, and the nearest railway stations are in Crewkerne and Yeovil. Formerly there were closer stations at Martock and Ilminster, but both of these were closed in the 1960s.
Religious sites.
The Church of England Church of St Peter and St Paul has Saxon origins. It retains a 13th-century crosswing, with the remainder of the buildings dating from the 15th century, however it underwent major restorations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The tower is an irregular octagon on plan, wider on east-west axis, which is believed to be the tallest octagonal church tower in the UK.
The Coke Memorial Methodist Church was built in 1881 replacing an 1809 chapel on the site. It was named after Thomas Coke, who was curate of the village 1772-76 and important, along with John Wesley, amongst the founders of Methodism.
A United Reform Church was built in 1863. This is now used as a public hall.
Sports.
The South Petherton Walking Group is aimed at the over 50's and aims to encourage this healthy, social activity amongst residents and visitors.
The Recreation Ground provides pitches for football and cricket clubs and there are also facilities for tennis and bowls and a children’s play area. The football pitch is particularly large for the standard of football that the club compete in, being over 120 yards long and 90 yards wide. South Petherton Football Club were relegated from the Premier Division of the Perry Street & District League in 2013 after a highly successful run in recent years,

DRB Class 01.10

The locomotives of DRB Class 01.10 were standard locomotives ("Einheitsdampflokomotiven") used for express train services by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Class 01.10 was a development of the Class 01.
History.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn needed powerful steam locomotives with a top speed of 150 km/h and the ability to haul trains of 500 tonnes at 120 km/h, as well as trains of 350 tonnes at 100 km/h up ramps with a 5 ‰ incline, for its network of fast D and FD trains. This was more than the existing Class 01 and 03 engines were able to cope with, because their two-cylinder driving gear did not have sufficient reserves of power. The 01.10 had three cylinders. To reduce rolling resistance, the new vehicles were equipped with a streamlined body shell that reached down to 400 mm above the top of the rails.
Out of a perceived requirement for 400 locomotives, 204 were initially order in 1939 from all the major locomotive factories in Germany. However, as a result of the Second World War only 55 were eventually delivered. All these engines came from Schwartzkopff.
The Class 01.10 was delivered to the following locomotive sheds ("Bahnbetriebswerke"):
Leipzig HBF West, Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof, Halle, Hamburg-Altona, Hannover-Ost, Bebra, Erfurt P, Dresden-Altstadt, Frankfurt/Oder PBF, Würzburg and Munich as well as the Grunewald Locomotive Research Office. During the war, some of the locomotives were transferred to Breslau and Kattowitz .
In 1944 all the locomotives were moved to western Germany due to the course of the war.
After the Second World War the engines were in a pitiful state. Sections of streamlining were missing and the boilers, made of steel that was not particularly durable, showed the first signs of fatigue. On 20 June 1945 the entire class was retired. At that stage, the locomotives had each driven less than 500,000 km. However, as a result of the overriding shortage of locomotives after the war, the class was partially reprieved, and several engines with minor damage were even temporarily overhauled. However the majority of the engines remained sidelined until 1949. In the same year it was decided that all the locomotives, apart from one (01 1067) which was finally retired, should be refurbished. As part of this refurbishment the streamlined shells of locomotive and tender were completely removed, and Witte smoke deflectors were fitted. The frontal view of the locomotives had an unusual appearance for German locomotives at that time. The feedwater heater remained in its old location across the front of the chimney and the smokebox door was cut off above the middle. Only 2 engines were provided with the otherwise normal round smokebox door.
However, the problem of the boiler being made of non-durable "St 47 K" steel remained. Because the machines needed to be operational, it was decided in 1953 to tender for a new, welded, high-performance boiler. This was built by Henschel between 1953 and 1956 in Kassel, and installed at the Brunswick repair depot, along with a mixer preheater system.
In 1956 number 01 1100 was given, along with a new boiler, oil-firing by way of a trial. This enabled its performance to be increased. In addition, oil-firing can be more finely controlled and could be matched more easily to the operating conditions. The engines were therefore more economical than coal-fired locomotives. Working conditions for stokers were also improved. The energy supply was regulated by slides ("Schieber"). Greasing the driving gear, however, remained a stoker's task. Nevertheless, the stoker wa now freed from the hard work of shovelling coal and could better support the engine driver in observing the line. Heavy oil, then available as a waste product, was used for firing. Following their positive experience with this system, the DB decided in 1957 to convert another 33 locomotives of this class to oil-firing.
In 1968 the coal-fired locomotives were given the designation "011" and the oil-fired ones the number "012", as part of the renumbering to conform with electronic data processing (EDP).
The locomotives were used on all important main lines until their electrification, for example on the Würzburg–Hamburg or Hamm–Hamburg routes. Towards the end they were deployed on the Hamburg–Westerland and Rheine–Norddeich lines.
On 31 May 1975 the last engines from Rheine shed ran scheduled services, with a great deal of participation from railway fans, and finally retired.
Preserved Locomotives.
Thanks to their relatively recent withdrawal from service several of these locomotives have been preserved.
Class 01.10 engines may be visited in a number of museums, such as the German Steam Locomotive Museum in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg, Upper Franconia in Bavaria. Number 01 1081 is being refurbished as a museum exhibit at the Augsburg Railway Park ("Bahnpark Augsburg").

1961 VFL Grand Final

The 1961 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Footscray Football Club and Hawthorn Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 23 September 1961. It was the 65th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1961 VFL season. The match, attended by 107,935 spectators, was won by Hawthorn by a margin of 43 points, marking that club's first premiership victory.
Hawthorn, who were competing in their inaugural VFL Grand Final despite being in the competition since 1925, came into the game as minor premiers and favourites. Footscray, the 1954 premiership winners, had finished the home and away season in fourth place but upset the Ron Barassi-led Melbourne by 27 points in the Preliminary Final to end the Demons' sequence of seven consecutive Grand Final appearances.
It was a young Footscray side, with only two players coming into the game with more than 80 VFL games behind them, although one of them was veteran Ted Whitten. Hawthorn's Brendan Edwards was playing in his 100th VFL game and dominated in the centre. Despite trailing at half time, Hawthorn won comfortably in the end courtesy of a dominant third quarter in which they kicked six goals to just one by Footscray.
The Bulldogs are yet to appear in another Grand Final.
The 1961 Grand Final is the oldest currently available on DVD. Videos of the 1962, 1963 and 1964 Grand Finals have not yet surfaced. It is also the first Grand Final in VFL/AFL history that did not include any of the original eight clubs that formed the VFL in 1897 (Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St. Kilda, South Melbourne).

Battle of the Bone

Battle of the Bone is an 2008 British independent zombie film written and directed by George Clarke, and is claimed as Northern Ireland's "first ever" kung-fu zombie movie.
Background.
Both the film's title and its plot timeline being set on 12 July, stem from King William III's 12 July 1690 Battle of the Boyne. Created on a budget of ₤10,000, the filmmaker chose The Troubles as the film's inspiration and as a means to address the issue of division with a twist that shows the two sides of the Belfast community joining together to deal with a common threat. The film was first screened in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 17 July 2008.
Plot.
As rival mobs battle it out on the streets of Belfast, three friends are caught in the middle and have to contend not only with the rioters but a horde of marauding zombies.
Release.
The film first screened in Belfast, on 17 July 2008, and was followed by a DVD release on 23 October 2008. The film also secured an exclusive partnership with DVD rental kiosk operator The Movie Booth to offer rental copies of the movie in Belfast based DVD rental machines.
Writer/director George Clarke joined the film's stars Alan Crawford and Shane Todd in a promotion tour to sign DVDs and pose for photographs.
Reception.
The movie showed in October 2008 at The Freakshow Horror Film Festival in Florida. The contest was adjudicated by George A. Romero, where the film won the Audience Choice Award 2008. BOTB has also attracted interest from Hong Kong and Canada.
Canadian critical review site – www.critical-film.com described it as a "relentlessly kinetic and joyous picture; always running and usually running away, each character perpetually fighting for his/her life"
The director stated in January 2010, ""Battle of the Bone" may have wowed genre geeks, but some mainstream critics didn’t appreciate the film’s queasy concoction of zombies and Orangemen."

TVS Flame was a 125 cc motorcycle developed by TVS Motors. It was launched in the Indian market in January 2008 and discontinued in 2012 after TVS launched the Phoenix. 
Design and styling.
The TVS calls their design approach for Flame as Deltaedge. This is inspired by the delta wing of fighter jets and features design cues with a triangular theme, like the arrow shaped headlight. The turn indicators, named "Trafficators" by TVS is integrated to the fuel tank scoops.
Performance and fuel economy.
The engine is developed and patented by AVL and is licensed to TVS. The bike does the 0–60 km/h in 6.5 seconds and is capable of reaching a top speed of almost 100 km/h with a fuel economy of 79 kmpl for the single spark version. while the twin spark version does the 0–60 km/h in 6.1 seconds and manages a top speed in excess of 100 km/h.
Controversy.
Flame was in news because of a suit filed by Bajaj Auto alleging a patent infringement. In September 2007 Bajaj claimed that the Flame's engine, having two spark plugs is a violation of their patent no 195904 under the Patents act. After the Chennai high court restrained TVS from launching the bike with two spark plugs, TVS launched Flame with a single spark plug. 
TVS has stopped production of the single spark Flame. and relaunched the twinspark Flame on 13 November 2009

John of Epiphania

John of Epiphania () was a late sixth century Byzantine historian. 
John was born in Epiphania (modern Hama, Syria). He was a Christian and served as a legal counselor to the Patriarch of Antioch, Gregory (ca. 590). John was also a cousin of the church historian Evagrius Scholasticus.
John obviously received good training. In his role as legal adviser, he was a witness to the Persian king, Khosrau Parvez's retreat into Roman territory, and may have even met the king personally. Khosrau was restored to the Persian throne by the Roman emperor Maurice. John may have also visited Persia (cf. Fragment 1)
John wrote a history of the Byzantine-Persian wars; from the campaigns of Khosrau I against Justin II, to the flight of his grandson Khosrau II to the Byzantines. The work is lost, but a fragment is preserved. The history was used by Evagrius and Theophylact Simocatta. As with many other Byzantine works, it is written in an archaic form of Greek, meant to imitate the classical style (e.g. Thucidydes).

Siege of Varna (1201)

The siege of Varna () took place between 21 and 24 March 1201 at Varna, on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines. The Bulgarians were victorious and captured the city.
Prelude.
After the youngest of the three Asen brothers, Kaloyan, was crowned Emperor in early 1197 he immediately showed his resolution to continue the war with the Byzantines by all means and liberate all Bulgarian lands. In the next year Kaloyan even allied with Ivanko, the murderer of his eldest brother, Ivan Asen.
The siege.
At the turn of the new century he seized the strong castle of Constancia (near modern Simeonovgrad) and then struck in the opposite direction and besieged the last Byzantine stronghold to the north of the Balkan mountains, Varna. Varna was defended by a large garrison including western mercenaries who were known to be the bravest soldiers in the Byzantine army. To take the fortress the Bulgarian engineers constructed an enormous siege tower which was wider that the outer moat. With the help of the siege equipment the Bulgarian army was able to cross the moat and reach the walls of the city and on the third day of the siege, on 24 March 1201 the Bulgarians made a breakthrough. According to the Byzantine historian Nikitas Choniates Kaloyan did not hesitate to kill all defenders despite the fact that it was Easter. The Byzantines were thrown in the moat and buried alive. After that he destroyed the city walls and returned to the capital Tarnovo.
Aftermath.
By the end of the year Bulgaria and Byzantium started negotiation which ended with a peace treaty in the beginning of 1202. The Bulgarians secured their new gains and now were able to face the Hungarian threat to the north-west. After several battle in the valley of the Morava river, the Hungarians were defeated.

Ramji Rao Speaking

Ramji Rav Speaking (Malayalam: റാംജി റാവ് സ്പീക്കിംഗ്) is a 1989 Indian Malayalam comedy film written and directed by the Siddique-Lal duo. It stars Saikumar, Mukesh, Innocent and Rekha in the lead roles. The film deals with social factors affecting Kerala such as poverty and unemployment during the 1980s, and went on to become a cult classic. The film's plot is inspired from the 1971 film "See The Man Run" and Hindi film "Do Ladke Dono Kadke".
"Ramji Rav Speaking" marked the debut of director duo Siddique-Lal, actors Saikumar, Rekha, N. F. Varghese, Harishree Ashokan, and music director S. Balakrishnan. "Mannar Mathai Speaking" (1995) and "Mannar Mathai Speaking 2" (2014) are the sequels to this movie.
Fazil remade this film in Tamil as "Arangetra Velai". Priyadarshan remade the film into the Hindi film "Hera Pheri", a film which became one of the biggest hits in Bollywood. It was also remade in Telugu as "Dhanalakshmi I Love You".
Plot.
The story revolves around three unemployed people (the third is a middle age unsuccessful theater owner). The story opens with the arrival of Balakrishnan (Saikumar) in Cochin to dispute the denial of his company job which he was supposed to receive several years ago. Several candidates overtook his chance and the last one was Rani (Rekha) who pretends to be an influential figure in the town. Rani threatens Balakrishnan to continue to work despite his efforts to overthrow her. The company manager (Sankaradi) who knows her family situation (poor and pathetic) helps her to remain in the job. Balakrishnan determined to stay back in the town until he succeeds to get back his job back from Rani.
During his stay Balakrishnan finds a temporary lodging in 'Urvasai Theater' owned by Mannar Mathayi (Innocent), with another tenant Gopalakrishnan (Mukesh), both were unemployed and with insignificant earning. Initially Gopalakrishnan does not like the new tenant and tries to expel him from the house but all his efforts are in vain. Gopalakrishnan is tricky and cunning. He lies to his mother that he works in a large company based in Calcutta and is building a new house in Cochin. Balakrishnan finds out and misunderstands Gopalakrishnan as a fraud. But what shocks Balakrishnan most was the realization of Rani's family situation, which pours sympathy in his mind toward her and decided to sacrifice his job. That day night Balakrishnan gets drunk and reveals the fraud play of Gopalakrishnan to Mannar Mathayi. Goplakrishnan confesses his play and justifies that projecting himself as rich and employed was the only way in front of him to comfort his mother. The truth melts the mind of both Balakrishnan and Mannar Mathayi and they all became friends and decided to enjoy the night despite their unending problems.
The turning point of the movie is here. Balakrishnan wakes in the night hearing the phone ring. A gang leader called Ramji Rao (Vijayaraghavan) has kidnapped the daughter of a rich businessman Urumees Thampan (Devan) and is asking a ransom of a lakh rupees. The three unemployed have no relation with Urummes Thampan; the phone was misdialed. Panicking, Balakrishan tries to find the number of Urumees Thampan from a phone directory, only to find out that the numbers of Urvasi Theaters and Urumees Thampan are interchanged in the directory. Gopalakrishnan develops a quick game play and asks Balakrishnan to act as a dealer between Ramji Rao and Urumees Thampan, without letting them know each other, and demand a ransom of three lakh to Urumees Thampan, instead of a lakh, and get the girl from Ramji Rav and earn two lakh. The plan was set properly, but the job wasn't easy to carry out by hiding from the police and keeping Ramji Rao and Urumees anonymous to each other. Finally after a struggle the three rescue the girl from the gang leader and hand her over to Urumees Thamapan. They confesses the game to him upon a police encounter. Urumees forgives them and is thankful for returning his daughter, and offers three lakh rupees as a prize. The story happily ends here.

Agios Nikolaos is a traditional quiet village in the south-east of Corfu near to the villages of Petriti and Notos. The village was at one time called "Kolokythaki" (Κολοκυθάκι, meaning "courgette"). The main industry is agriculture as the land around is flat and the soil is rich despite the main part of the village being situated on a hill. There is a little tourism, mainly people who want to keep clear of large resorts. There are very few old houses in the village; most were built in relatively recently, giving the place a more affluent feel than most Corfiot Villages. The villagers came down from the old village of Korakades following a landslide which washed most of the village away.

Jean Crasset

Jean Crasset (b. at Dieppe, France, 3 January 1618; d. at Paris, 4 January 1692) was a French Jesuit theologian, known as an ascetical writer.
Life.
He entered the Society of Jesus in 1638, and became professor of humanities and philosophy. He was director for twenty-three years of a famous sodality of men connected with the professed house of the Jesuits in Paris, and was also a successful preacher.
Works.
Crasset is the author of many ascetical works, among which are: 
He also published in 1689 a "Historie de l'eglise du japon" which has been translated into several languages but which is considered inferior to that of Charlevoix. Crasset's history was unoriginal, for it was drawn in great part from the work which Father Solier had issued in 1627; he retouched the style and continued the narrative from 1624 to 1658, but with crowded details. The author attributed the origin of the persecution of 1597 to the imprudence of the friars in making their religious ceremonies public. 
There is a posthumous work of his entitled "La foy victorieuse de l'infidélite et du libertinage". On 9 September 1656, the Bishop of Orléans issued an interdict against him for having in one of his sermons charged several ecclesiastics with sustaining the propositions condemned by the Bull of Pope Innocent X, "Cum occasione" (31 May 1653). The interdict was removed in the following February.

No. 58 Squadron RAF

No. 58 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Air Force.
History.
No. 58 Squadron was first formed at Cramlington, Northumberland, on 8 June 1916 as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. 
During World War I it operated initially as an advanced training unit but was mobilised in late 1917 and posted to the Western Front until the end of the war. There from February 1918 it flew F.E.2b's and from September, 1918 Handley Page 0/400's. Its targets included airfields, railway communications, rest billets and troop columns, and during some nine months of operational service it dropped 247 tons of bombs. In 1919 it was moved to Egypt as a training unit and redesignated in February 1920 as No. 70 Squadron
It was reformed in 1924 as a heavy bomber unit on training duties, commanded from 1925 by Squadron Leader Arthur Harris, later Air Marshal "Bomber" Harris.
At the start of World War II 58 Squadron was based at RAF Linton-on-Ouse flying Whitley bombers as part of No. 4 Group RAF in RAF Bomber Command. From October 1939 until February 1940 it was based at RAF Boscombe Down attached to Coastal Command carrying out convoy escort patrols. The squadron then returned in February 1940 to Linton-on-Ouse as part of Bomber Command and remained there for the next two years, undertaking its first bombing raid on 17 April 1940. In April 1942 until the autumn of 1944 it again returned to Coastal Command, based at RAF St Eval as part of No. 19 Group RAF. This time it operated as an anti-submarine squadron, converted to the Halifax bomber. For most of this period the squadron operated over the Western Approaches but then moved north to RAF Stornoway in Scotland as part of No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1944 the squadron switched from anti-submarine duties to anti-shipping duties, carrying out attacks on German shipping off the coast of Norway. It was disbanded on 25 May 1945.
In October 1946, No. 58 reformed at RAF Benson in the photo-reconnaissance role, mainly operating Mosquitoes. In March 1953 the squadron re-equipped with Canberra PR.3s and moved to RAF Wyton. These were replaced by Canberra PR.7s in 1955 which took part in the Operation Grapple hydrogen bomb tests at Christmas Island in the Pacific, and also were deployed to British Honduras to face a threat by Guatemala to overfly the country during an official visit by HRH Princess Margaret. The squadron disbanded on 1 September 1970. 
It was lastly reformed at RAF Wittering in 1973 as a ground-attack training unit equipped with Hawker Hunters before being finally disbanded in 1976.

Overview.
"Only You" is in fact the second version of the show-stopping love song at the 11th hour in "Starlight Express". In the Original London production, Pearl sang a solo "Only He", a passionate power ballad originally performed by Stephanie Lawrence. At the end of this solo Rusty came to find Pearl, and together they sang a very short reprise of the song, "Only You". "Only He" proved to be a highly demanding song, coming shortly after the performers have raced at up to 30mph on roller skates, and it was found this song in this context was too demanding for most performers to sing.
"Only You" is essentially Pearl's solo "Only He", as opposed to the reprise version in the original, re-arranged as a duet between Pearl and Rusty, with the most demanding octave leap passages removed. It replaced "Only He" in London in 1987. This simplified duet version was used in all productions from Broadway until the 1992 London re-vamp. This version is in nature sweet and reflective, less of a show-stopper but more in keeping with the character's journeys.
Only You was, in turn, replaced by "Next Time You Fall in Love", a new song written as part of the 1992 London production revamp, then used in following productions. "Next Time" is a re-working of Lloyd Webber's song "The Ballad of Billy Macaw" from Cats. Musically it is near identical, with replacement lyrics by Don Black. The lyrics of "Next Time" make very little sense within the context of the show, however at the time it was released as a chart single.
"Next time" was added to the German production in 2003, replacing "Du Allein" (direct translation of "Only You"). The German lyrics resolved the issue of lacking context, the song was titled "Allein im Licht der Sterne" (Alone, in the Starlight). At the same time the 2003 US Tour replaced "Next Time" with the second version of "Only He", a duet version that included the octave leaps from the original song, in a very rich, dramatic arrangement, aided by the use of pre-recorded instrumentation. This version has now found its way to the 2009 New Zealand tour.
In 2008 the second version of "Only He" was included in the German production, now titled "Nur Mit Ihm" (Only with Him) to distinguish from the earlier "Du Allein".
Context.
Rusty's journey through the story of Starlight Express shows him, in his darkest hour, calling to the Starlight Express for help. The Starlight Express answers telling him "Only You have the power within you...". Rusty gains belief in himself, and goes on to race in the final. During the race, Pearl, who is racing with Greaseball, is injured by Electra and disconnected at full speed. She is sure to crash when Rusty leaves the race to rescue her. He then goes on to win the race, but has lost Pearl. He wants to declare his love openly to her, but first he must find her. Meanwhile, Pearl, injured and alone far from the finish line, realises how she has been blind to her own love for the little Steam Train who would do anything for her. Only He actually cares for her, the other engines left her to die.
The song is used for the moment when Pearl realises that Rusty is her true love, and when Rusty reiterates for the umpteenth time his love for her.
Music.
The music was composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The key is dependent on the production;, in London it was D major (Only he was in C Major); Germany, A major, later B major; Broadway, C Major; Australia/Japan, A major; and in the UK tour B Major. It later transposes up a tone twice in all versions but London.
The tune is also used in the 'Starlight Sequence', along with the Starlight Express theme. The "Only You" theme represents discovery; of Rusty's self belief, of Pearl's love.
Underneath the tune is a very simple chord sequence. Variations on the sequence have been used within songs such as Our Last Summer by ABBA, Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft by Klaatu, Don't Walk Away from Xanadu and Easy Like Sunday Morning by Lionel Richie (similar to 'Poppa's Blues', which uses a traditional blues chord sequence and bassline). The sequence (in Roman Numerals) is as follows;
Lyrics.
The Lyrics for "Only He" and "Only You" are by Richard Stilgoe.
The commonly known opening verse of "Only He" – "look at me, a woman, calm and in control/ No silly girl whose head's always turning" is in fact from the single release version of the song, and are obviously out of context when sung by Pearl, who is exactly a silly girl whose head is turned by each attractive male that passes her. The stage production used significantly different lyrics, more appropriate to the context: "known him for a lifetime, known him not at all/ Thought there was nothing special about him". "Only You" cuts this first verse, Pearl starting at the chorus "Only You/ have the power to move me"
The second version of "Only He" has lyrics re-worked from the original. The alterations are not credited to David Yazbek, who worked on re-vamping the show for the 2003 US tour. The lyrics are predominantly Richard Stilgoe's original work altered slightly, but include lyrics such as Rusty's singing "You are my Starlight" to Pearl. Earlier on, Rusty looked for 'the Starlight Express'. For romantic purposes of this number, he suggests that Pearl is 'his Starlight', 'Starlight' being a metaphor of Rusty's motivation.
Obviously he cannot mean it literally, as the Starlight Express, heard onstage a few scenes previously, was definitely not Pearl! The most glaring contextual nonsensities in the show have appeared at this point in the plot, including Don Black's "Back then was when we touched the Starlight". Rusty and Pearl have a minimal relationship at the beginning of the show, they have no significant past other than a tentative agreement to race together. And while (in the London staging) Rusty did touch the Starlight Express, Pearl was clearly not with him. 
Spoken Lines.
This song is one of the few from Starlight Express to have spoken lines, acting as a bridge passage in the music between Rusty's first verse and the first chorus sung as a duet:
Choreography/Blocking.
Choreography and blocking is, of course, entirely dependent on production and the capabilities of the set. In London, as the other characters cleared the stage to follow Poppa looking for Rusty and Pearl, a scene change was suggested by Pearl, sat on a railway buffer, pushed onstage behind them. From this perch she started singing. As the passion in the song built, she stood and skated around. In other productions without mobile set pieces, Pearl kneels to start her song. At Rusty's entrance, Pearl turns away from him, she can't immediately face him from shame at how she's hurt him. But the spoken lines give her the confidence to turn to face him, and to skate with him, before finishing with their fisted hands touching, to show that they are 'coupled'. This gesture is also used by Pearl and Dinah in the coaches dialogue in the beginning of 'Freight', as the coaches are teaming up against the Trucks. Volta and Joule also use this gesture after the final race, though sometimes they high-five. Rusty and Pearl's edition involves a hug, and sometimes a kiss, resulting in a more romantic suggestion.

39th Guards Motor Rifle Division

The 39th Guards Motor Rifle Division of the Soviet Ground Forces was a mechanised infantry division active from 1965 to 1992. It was originally formed as the 39th Guards Rifle Division of the Workers and Peasant's Red Army. It was formed during the German-Soviet War as part of the 62nd Army and assigned to the defense of Stalingrad, officially arriving in the theater in August 1942. In September the division fought through German forces which were attempting to encircle the city, and was assigned to defend the 'Volga Corridor,' the last supply line remaining for Soviet units in the city.
Defense of the Red October Steel Works.
From September 30, 1942 the division, which could muster only roughly half its original strength, was assigned to defend the Red October steel works. From that date until February 2, 1943, the division was involved in almost constant combat with numerically superior German forces. On October 14, 1942 the 39th repulsed a major German counterattack involving three Infantry divisions, two Panzer divisions, and 3,000 combat sorties by the Luftwaffe. For five months the 39th Guards maintained their tenuous hold on the Red October factory, holding an area only 3000 yards wide and 1000 yards in depth. Along with similar pockets at the Dzerzhinsky tractor factory and the Barrikady gun factory, Red October represented one of the last viable defensive positions on the west bank of the Volga River. Soviet troops fought major battles from building to building and room to room, with success often measured in mere yards. As the Germans desperately tried to eliminate these pockets they poured more and more troops into the city, weakening their flanks and wasting men and materiel in what was becoming a meat-grinder for the Wehrmacht. These factors contributed directly the successes of the Soviet counter-offensives of November and December (see Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn), and the subsequent encirclement and eventual surrender of Gen. Friedrich Paulus's 6th Army.
Refit and Ukraine, 1943.
Following the victory at Stalingrad the remnants of the 62nd Army, including the 39th Guards, was placed in reserve and became the basis for the newly formed 8th Guards Army, receiving the honorific 'Guards' in honor of their heroic defense of Stalingrad. The army was placed under the command of Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov. Through 1943 the 8th Guards Army fought across Ukraine, crossing the North Donets River, establishing a bridgehead south of Isyum, and in cooperation with adjacent armies, advanced on the Don Basin and ultimately liberated it. They fought across the Don, through Dnepropetrovsk, continuing to Zaporozhe, and participated in the fighting on the Zaporozhe bridgehead across the Dnepr on October 10–14.
1944.
The division turned south and fought for the liberation of Nikolayev in March 1944, and liberated Odessa in April. Turning north into Moldavia the division liberated Kovel before participating in the Lovov-Sandomir Operation, which began on July 13 and lasted until August 29. On July 20, they crossed the Bug River and crossed into Poland. On July 24, the 39th Guards liberated Lublin and continued to advance on Warsaw, establishing a major bridgehead on the Vistula River which was the key for the Soviet advance towards Silesia, central Poland and the German border. They encountered furious counterattacks by German units, with the 8th Army losing 17,000 men in the process.
1945 and the Battle of Berlin.
On January 12, the 39th Guards participated in the Vistula-Oder Offensive, which lasted 23 days and saw the division advance 500 km through Poland. They crushed the German defenders (including the elite "Großdeutschland Division") as they liberated the towns of Lodz and Posnan, finally arriving at the Oder River just north of Frankfurt on February 3. They stormed the Kustrin Fortress and established a bridgehead over the Oder, within 60 km of Berlin. They attacked the city from the east, pushing through the area of Karlshorst, across Tempelhof Airport and Landwehr Canal, destroying the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland and then the 17th Panzer Division just south of the Reichstag.
The 39th Guards Rifle Division pushed north and fought through the Tiergarten, ending their war along Charlottenburger Chaussee at the Brandenburg Gate, meeting units from the 207th and 150th Rifle Divisions just 250 yards from the Reichstag. The final banner of the division, which had served from the center of Stalingrad to the center of Berlin, read: "39th Barvenkovskikh Guards Order of Lenin, Twice Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Second Class and Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Second Class Rifle Division."
Cold War Service.
Along with the rest of the 8th Guards Army, from 1949 the division was stationed in Ohrdruf, Gotha and Meiningen, East Germany (the GDR). Following the Second World War, the 39th Guards became a Motor Rifle Division in 1957. At different times (up to the 1980s), some regiments and separate battalions changed their garrison and placed in other cities of Thuringia - Arnstadt and Saalfeld. It was opposite the strategically vital Fulda Gap, and the U.S. V and VII US Corps in NATO's Central Army Group. The distance from the locations of parts of the division to the state border with Germany was about 5 kilometers. Withdrawal from Germany began about October 28, 1991. 
The division had the Military mail Feldpost number 38865.
By a Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the USSR Council of Ministers on 30 October 1967, the "For Service to protect the Soviet homeland and achieved high results in combat and political training and 50th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution to award the 39th Guards Motorized Rifle Barvenkovsky Order of Lenin Red Banner Orders of Suvorov twice and Bogdan Khmelnitsky Division the Commemorative Banner of the CPSU Central Committee, and leave it for an eternal possession as a symbol of valor.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany, the division was disbanded after a temporary relocation to Bila Tserkva in Ukraine in 1992.

George Bradburn

George Bradburn (March 4, 1806 – July 26, 1880) was an American politician and Unitarian minister in Massachusetts known for his support for abolitionism and women's rights. He attended the 1840 conference on Anti-Slavery in London where he made a stand against the exclusion of female delegates. In 1843 he was with Frederick Douglass on a lecture tour in Indiana when they were attacked. Lydia Maria Child wrote with regard to his work on anti-slavery that he had " a high place among the tried and true."
Biography.
Bradburn was born March 4, 1806 to James and Sarah Bradburn in Attleboro, a small town in Massachusetts. After his mother died, he was brought up by his half sister Fanny. He first took a trade as a machinist until he decided to pursue further studies at the age on nineteen. He continued his education at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. After studying with Hosea Ballou (the 2nd) he attended the Harvard Divinity School.
His first ministerial position was in Nantucket in 1831, but oddly, his church was sold while he was away and his congregation was later disbanded in 1834. While in Nantucket he met and married his first wife, Lydia, but within a year of marriage she had died, and his only daughter died a year later. This cast a "shadow over his whole life." Moreover, Bradburn had begun to lose his sense of hearing. However, he was well regarded and was elected by the Whigs to serve as the Massachusetts Legislature in 1839 for three years.
He became associated with the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1839 and he brought forward related radical legislation. He led a movement which repealed a marriage law. After this change, "People in Massachusetts, wishing to marry, are under no necessity of comparing complexions" in 1842.
The year of the "World's Convention".
In 1840, a woman's right to serve on an American anti-slavery committee was established when Abby Kelley became a full member of the business committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society at their annual convention. This was not without cost, and some of the members left the meeting, but others who were known as the "Garrisonian wing" believed in equal rights of all Americans, irrespective of gender. So when an invitation was received for the World Anti-Slavery Convention on June 12, 1840 in London, it was not surprising that Massachusetts decided to not only send William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and Bradburn, but also Lydia Maria Child, Harriet Martineau and Maria Weston Chapman.
Bradburn travelled first class on the ship "Roscoe" on the May 7, 1840. Other anti-slavery delegates aboard the ship were James and Lucretia Mott, Emily Winslow and her father Isaac, Abby South, Henry Grew his daughter Mary Grew and Elizabeth Neall. After they arrived many took the opportunity to tour England. Bradburn was able to visit various places including Blenheim Palace, Eaton Hall, Stratford on Avon, Oxford University and Warwick Castle. He was later able to call on these experiences in lectures later in life.
Just before the "World's Anti-Slavery Convention" opened, the British organiser Joseph Sturge explained that female delegates would not be allowed. This "insane innovation, this woman-intruding delusion," was rebuked by the leading English Anti-Slavery members. Some of the male delegates from America sided with the women, including George Bradburn, Wendell Phillips, James Mott, William Adam, Isaac Winslow, J. P. Miller and Henry B. Stanton. William Lloyd Garrison, who was not there until the 17th, refused to take his seat until there was equality in seating. Interestingly, Henry Grew spoke in favour of the men's rights to exclude women despite his daughter being one of the excluded delegates. The American women had to join the other female observers like Lady Byron and were not allowed to participate in the convention. Not only was the equality of the sexes debated, but Bradburn said that "introducing any such words as 'Christian,' 'Religious,' and the like, by which persons of any religion whatever, or of no religion whatever, should be excluded from the Anti-Slavery platform.
The portrait of Bradburn which is shown at the top of this article and in Haydon's picture of the 1840 World Anti-Slavery convention was completed in a small room at the Freemasons hall where the convention was held. Bradburn commented that he felt that he had been given "too much severity or sharpness," but Haydon assured him that he looked "revolutionary" when giving his speeches. Bradburn made time after a visit to France to complete a third sitting on August 3, 1840. Bradburn then visited Newcastle, Scotland and Ireland, visiting people he had met at the convention including the Irish Nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell and Lady Byron, the mathematician (and the poet's estranged wife).
100 conventions.
In 1843 Bradburn accompanied Frederick Douglass and William A. White on a lecture tour organised by the American Anti-Slavery Society and called "100 conventions." This was not a tour preaching to the converted and he was, subsequently, attacked. Douglass was attacked and his hand broken so badly that he never recovered its full use. Other sources also place Bradburn there at Pendleton in Indiana on September 16, 1843, when the attack took place.
From 1846 to 1849, Bradburn edited the, "Pioneer and Herald of Freedom" in Lynn, Massachusetts.
Douglass told a group in Ireland of a story about how Blackburn, who now was nearly completely deaf, was challenged for assuming that ministers could adopt the abolitionists message as they "must live." Bradburn said, "I deny any such necessity — I dispute your premises. I deny that it is necessary for any man to live, unless he can live honestly."
1850.
In 1850 in Boston, Bradburn married Frances H. Parker. Although she later would became an invalid and prevent him from taking up overseas positions, she was the one who eventually completed his memoirs. That year he was working for the "Boston Chronotype" and he attended the two day "National Woman's Rights Convention" which was held in Brinley Hall, Worcester. The convention was called to order by Sarah H. Earle, and chaired by Paulina Wright Davis of Rhode Island on October 23, 1850. There were 268 delegates, but the vast majority were from Massachusetts. The news of the convention was widely reported, but frequently in a disparaging way. Only four local newspapers were thought to deal with the subject well and one of those was the "Lynn Pioneer" (which was edited by Bradburn).
In 1851, George and Frances moved to Cleveland, Ohio where Bradburn helped to edit the "True Democrat", a daily newspaper. After two years he went on lecture tours where he would sometimes speak every night for 26 days. His lectures at this time were not only political but drew on his experiences in Europe in 1840. He was able to use his trip to London as the basis of entertaining and informative lectures.
In 1859, he occupied the pulpit of a Unitarian church in Athol, Massachusetts and resided there for another two years. He made good friends there and returned to visit ever summer for the next twenty years. He took a job in a customs house which had been organised by his friend Samuel Chase, but he sadly missed his ability to work. At the end of his life he called out to William A. White, who his wife remembered as a friend from his time lecturing to thousands.
Death.
At Bradburn's funeral in 1880, Lysander Spooner read a eulogy and was a pallbearer. His wife published his biography in 1883. Lydia Maria Child wrote "Surely in this country, and within this century, no other cause has so tested the moral natures of men and women, as did the anti-slavery cause in its early days: and no one who knew George Bradburn at that time will doing question his right to a high place among the tried and true."

Ia (genus)

Ia is a genus of bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It belongs to the subfamily Vespertilioninae and has been placed in the tribe Vespertilionini. In the past, it has also been considered a synonym or subgenus of the genera "Pipistrellus" or "Eptesicus", which used to contain many more species than they do now. "Ia" comprises a single living species, the great evening bat ("I. io") of eastern and southeastern Asia, and one extinct fossil species, "I. lanna", from the Miocene epoch in Thailand. Another living species, "I. longimana", was recognized in the past, but it is no longer considered a valid species distinct from the great evening bat.
At two letters, "Ia" is the shortest possible name of any animal genus under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

No. 59 Squadron RAF

No. 59 Squadron is a squadron of the Royal Air Force.
History.
No.59 Squadron first became operational on 1 August 1916 at Narborough Airfield in Norfolk as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. During the Second World War it was attached to RAF Fighter Command (1937–1940), Bomber Command (taking part in the Millennium II raid on Bremen) and Coastal Command (1940–1945).

Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden

The Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden was the highest association football league in the German states of Württemberg and Baden and the Prussian Province of Hohenzollern from 1923 to 1933. The league was disbanded with the rise of the Nazis to power in 1933.
Overview.
The league was formed in 1923, after a league reform which was decided upon in Darmstadt, Hesse. It replaced the "Kreisliga Südwest" and the "Kreisliga Württemberg" as the highest leagues in the region.
The league started out with eight clubs from the two states and the Prussian province in the region, but without clubs from the Ulm, who were playing in the "Bezirksliga Bayern" and Mannheim, who played in the "Bezirksliga Rhein" instead. The eight clubs played each other in a home-and-away round with the top team advancing to the Southern German championship, which in turn was a qualification tournament for the German championship.
For the second and third seasons, 1924–25 and 1925–26, the modus remained unchanged.
For the 1926-27 season, the league was expanded to ten teams. The top team was again qualified for the finals. The runners-up of the "Bezirksligas" in the south from then on also played a championship round to determined a third team from the region to go to the German finals with the Karlsruher FV from the region qualifying for this.
After this season, the league was split into a "Württemberg" and a "Baden" group, the first having nine and the second eight teams. No final was played between the two group winners as both went on to the Southern German championship. The second and third placed team of each division would also advance to the separate round of the runners-up like in the previous season.
The 1928-29 season saw no change in modus but both leagues now operated on a strength of eight clubs. The qualification system for the finals also remained unchanged. This system remained in place until 1931.
For the 1931-32 season, both divisions were expanded to ten teams. The top-two teams from each league then advanced to the Southern German finals, which were now staged in two regional groups with a finals game between the two group winners at the end. The same system applied for the final season of the league in 1932-33.
With the rise of the Nazis to power, the "Gauligas" were introduced as the highest football leagues in Germany. In Württemberg-Baden, the "Gauliga Württemberg" and the "Gauliga Baden" replaced the "Bezirksliga" as the highest level of play.
National success.
The clubs from the "Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden" did not manage to win a German championship in this era and were dominated by the much stronger competition from the "Bezirksliga Bayern".

Renewable energy law in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania approved a bill that establishes a $500 million fund to support renewable energy projects. Special Session House Bill 1 authorizes the Commonwealth Financing Authority to borrow $500 million, most of which will be split into six funding sources relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy: $80 million in grants and loans for solar energy projects; $100 million in grants, loans, and rebates for up to 35% of the cost of solar energy projects at residences and small businesses; $165 million in grants and loans for alternative energy projects, excluding solar energy, at businesses and local government facilities; $25 million for wind and geothermal energy projects; $40 million to help start-up businesses involved in energy efficiency technologies; and $25 million in grants and loans to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing homes and small business buildings. An additional $65 million will go toward pollution control technologies and to help low-income families pay their energy bills.
In addition to the $500 million fund, the bill creates a Consumer Energy Program that is funded at $15 million for the next 3 fiscal years, then gradually decreases to $8 million by the 2015–2016 fiscal year, for a total of $100 million. Of that, $92.5 million will support loans, grants, and rebates for up to 25% of the cost of energy efficiency improvements to homes and small businesses, while $5 million will support low-interest loans for energy efficiency improvements to homes. An additional $50 million will be available over the next 8 years to support tax credits for 15% of the cost of alternative energy projects, capped at $1 million per year for each project.
Biofuels.
Governor Edward Rendell also approved two bills on July 10, 2008 that relate to biofuels.
House Bill 1202 could add as much as of advanced biofuels to the state's fuel supply. It requires all retail diesel fuel sold in the state to contain 2% biodiesel, once the in-state production of biodiesel reaches per year, increasing incrementally to a 20% biodiesel requirement, once the in-state production of biodiesel reaches per year (but only if vehicle manufacturers approve the use of 20% biodiesel). Likewise, all retail gasoline sold in the state must contain 10% ethanol, once the in-state production of cellulosic ethanol reaches per year. The state already has a biodiesel production capacity of per year, so the 2% biodiesel requirement could go into effect soon, if production is high enough.
To encourage biodiesel production, Special Session Senate Bill 22 will offer a subsidy of 75 cents per gallon of biodiesel produced, capped at $1.9 million per year for each producer. The bill also expands a hybrid vehicle rebate program to include plug-in hybrids and other alternative fuel vehicles.

Harilaid

The Harilaid peninsula is a peninsula on the northwest coast of the island of Saaremaa in Estonia. It should not be confused with the islet of Harilaid which lies between the islands of Vormsi and Hiiumaa.
Harilaid covers an area of and is low lying (the highest elevation is ). It is connected to the mainland by a wide neck of land, and was a separate island until the end of the 17th century.
Large numbers of birds stop on Harilaid on their migration route, and there is a resting site of grey seals on the west coast. There is a large pine plantation on the peninsula, started in the 1970s and inhabited by elk and wild boar. The peninsula was added to the Vilsandi National Park in 1993.
There is no record of a settled population on the peninsula. The Kiipsaare lighthouse was built at the tip of the peninsula in 1933. At that time the lighthouse was almost inland, but it is now a few metres offshore. It is now unused, and has a pronounced lean as a result of erosion. The Estonian war film "Somnambuul" was shot there in 2004.
Access to the peninsula is by a rough road from Kihelkonna.

No. 79 Squadron RAF

No. 79 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Air Force.
History.
World War I.
It was first formed at Gosport on 1 August 1917 as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. It was equipped with Sopwith Dolphin fighter aircraft in December that year, moving to France in February 1918. It specialised in low-level ground-attack operations, mainly in support of the British Second Army. Despite its lack of emphasis on air to air combat, by the time of the Armistice, the squadron had claimed 64 enemy aircraft and nine kite balloons. Five aces had served in it: Francis W. Gillet, future Air Commodore Ronald Bannerman, Frederic Ives Lord, John McNeaney, and Edgar Taylor. 
After the end of the war, it formed part of the British Army of Occupation, before being disbanded at Bickendorf on 15 July 1919.
Post World War I through 1942.
It was reformed on 22 March 1937 by splitting off "B" Flight of No. 32 Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill, equipped with Gloster Gauntlet biplane fighters. It received more modern Hawker Hurricane fighters in November 1938, retaining these aircraft when the Second World War began. It claimed its first success on 21 November 1939,when it shot down a Dornier Do 17 over the English Channel. As the Battle of France heated up,it was deployed to Merville,operating over France for ten days, claiming 25 German aircraft. During the Battle of Britain the squadron operated from Biggin Hill and RAF Hawkinge in July, being moved to RAF Acklington in Northumberland for a rest before returning to Biggin in August.
Far Eastern service.
In 1942, it was sent to the Far East, arriving in India in May, where the squadron flew primarily ground attack missions, initially with later mark cannon armed Hurricanes. In June 1944 the squadron re-equipped with P-47 Thunderbolt IIs under SEAC command. It disbanded at Meiktila in Burma on 30 December 1945.
Korean War era onwards.
The squadron was reformed again on 15 November 1951 as a fighter-reconnaissance squadron, flying Gloster Meteor FR.9s, based at RAF Wunstorf in West Germany. It was re-equipped with Swift FR.5s in June 1956, being transferred to RAF Gutersloh (approx Sept 1956) due to the proximity of the Russian Zone to RAF Wunstorf. It was renumbered as 4 Squadron on 1 January 1961. 
Operational training role from 1967 onwards.
No. 76 Squadron was reformed as part of No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Chivenor in North Devon on 2 January 1967, tasked with training pilots to fly the Hawker Hunter until disbanded on 2 September 1974, when it was reformed as one of the component squadrons of No.1 Tactical Weapons Unit, flying first Hunters and then the BAe Hawk T.1 until finally disbanded at RAF Brawdy on 31 August 1992.

Aimé Picquet du Boisguy

Aimé Casimir Marie Picquet, chevalier du Boisguy, sometimes spelt Bois-Guy, (15 March 1776, Fougères, Ille-et-Vilaine - 25 October 1839, Paris) was a French chouan general during the French Revolution. He was nicknamed "the little general" by his men due to his youth. Still a child at the outbreak of the Revolution, he signalled his precocity to fight on the Royalist side, joining the Association bretonne at 15 and becoming aide de camp to La Rouërie. At 17 he was made leader of the chouannerie in the pays de Fougères, and a general at 19. Boisguy made the north-east of the Ille-et-Vilaine one of the most active areas of the Breton chouannerie, and showed himself an excellent tactician. Rarely beaten, the chouans there were among the best organised and best disciplined. Fighting in uniform from the end of 1795 and made up of elite troops, even so they suffered from a lack of cavalry and a near-total lack of artillery. The Republicans had to raise major forces to defeat them, and then only with difficulty. In both 1796 and 1800, Boisguy was the last general to surrender, making him one of the main figures of the chouannerie.

David Waronker (born June 5, 1961) is an American real estate investor. He is the President of CBD Real Estate Investment, L.L.C., and a lifelong ice hockey enthusiast. Waronker was the founder and commissioner of the World Hockey Association 2.
Biography.
Waronker is a proponent for affordable housing and for property rights. A total of twenty-three of his New Jersey developments were created and designed to include a set-aside for affordable housing. When communities resisted his development applications, he has sued the municipalities under the Fair Housing Act and the doctrine of the “Mount Laurel II” decision, in which he was the plaintiff. CBD and Waronker have been plaintiffs against New Jersey communities, including Cinnaminson Township, Edgewater Park, Harrison Township and Mount Laurel Township. 
David Waronker also contributed to, and eventually joined, the Board of Directors of “The Defenders of Property Rights," based in Washington, D.C. 
[http://www.truth-it.net/defenders_of_property_rights.html]
This organization defends, as the name implies, property rights issues, challenging government on behalf of individuals, including the poor. Waronker has been a board member for the Defenders since 2003. 
Presently, Waronker resides with his wife Ruth and their four children on their horse farm in Scottsdale, Arizona, dividing his time between his office locations in New Jersey, Arizona and Florida.
Education and early career.
Waronker grew up in Moorestown Township, New Jersey and was a 1980 graduate of Moorestown High School. He attended Boston University, "BU", on a Terriers dual-sport athletic scholarship. Waronker was a right winger on the school's hockey team (now a 5-time NCAA champion) and a sweep rower in the eight-man "crew". Waronker graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree from the BU School of Management, in 1984. 
During his senior year at BU, Waronker worked as an intern for the Beacon Hospitality Group, a Boston-based hotel developer. Waronker then worked for Jefferson National Mortgage of Marlton, New Jersey, as Head of the Real Estate Investment and Acquisition Division, focusing on the formation of limited partnerships to acquire, develop and sell residential development land throughout New Jersey.
CBD Development Group.
In 1985, David Waronker formed CBD Development, Inc., a New Jersey based residential developer of single and multi-family housing. CBD Land Consultants, Inc., a New Jersey Real Estate Brokerage firm, was formed in 1987, with Waronker as the broker of record. CBD Builders Inc. was formed in 1989 for the purpose of constructing single and multifamily housing projects. Together, all three CBD entities were commonly known as “The CBD Development Group,” with the main office located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. A sister office was located in Ship Bottom, New Jersey.
CBD experienced growth through the 1990s, developing large tracts of housing throughout New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. With its CBD Builders subsidiary, CBD became active in construction, and built residential projects in Medford, Cherry Hill, Lumberton Township, Southampton Township, Long Beach Island, Mount Laurel Township, Fieldsboro, Edgewater Park Township, Glassboro, Cinnaminson Township, Williamstown, and Pemberton.
Waronker and CBD were active members of the Builders League of South Jersey, where Waronker chaired subcommittees, eventually rising to the executive committee. Waronker then became the only two-term BLSJ President, in 1999-2001. CBD was named the BLSJ “Builder of the Year” in 2000. On the executive committee of the BLSJ, Waronker formed a subcommittee known as the “Regulatory Enforcement Committee”, which in conjunction with the BLSH Action Committee, was proactive in enforcing the rights of its members. This committee became the largest subcommittee in BLSH history.
CBD expanded operations to Central Florida in 1998. An office was established in the Walt Disney town of Celebration, and CBD eventually devoted most of its development work to Central and Southwest Florida. In 2005, Waronker formed “CBD Real Estate Investment, L.L.C.,” which today has replaced the three other CBD entities. This Florida limited liability company is active in acquiring development land throughout the state of Florida. With David Waronker at the helm, CBD Real Estate Investment, L.L.C. recently expanded into Arizona to buy and develop land. CBD currently has offices in Delran, New Jersey, and Scottsdale, Arizona, as well as the Florida office.
Additional business ventures.
In 2000, David Waronker formed USALANDSALE.COM, L.L.C., now known as USALANDSALE, L.L.C. Based in Celebration, Florida, this company became a national "land bank" with hundreds of parcels; building lots, vacant land, acreage, and development land in 41 of the 50 United States. USALANDSALE, L.L.C. also owned land in Canada.
Additionally, Waronker formed Desert Mountain Land Holdings L.L.C., a land bank in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2004. The company purchases vacant land and investment properties in the American Southwest, specifically in the states of Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Texas and California.
Waronker has invested in the ownership of minor league ice hockey teams, and was the lead investor and owner of the Florida Seals, Macon Trax, Jacksonville Barracudas, Miami Manatees, and Asheville Aces. 
Waronker also was the founder of the World Hockey Association 2, which eventually merged several of its teams with the defunct SEHL to form the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). Waronker provided much of the start up capital for all teams, including several in which he had no ownership interest, such as the teams in Lakeland and Birmingham. Today, Waronker still retains an interest in one “AA” hockey franchise and still retains his childhood fascination with the Philadelphia Flyers.
Charity work.

The Boulton & Paul P.9 was a British single-engined twin-seat aircraft. The wings and fuselage were constructed of wood with fabric covering. It was built by Boulton & Paul Ltd.
Design and development.
The P.9 was designed as a larger version of the companies P.6 single-engined biplane design, it was 6ft longer with a 2ft 6in increase in wing span. It had the same RAF 1 V-8 engine as the P.6 but had an increased fuel capacity. The first order was from L.L Long for use on a sheep station in Australia and the first aircraft was delivered to Australia and it was soon used on newspaper delivery flights. On 17 December 1919 it made the first flight across the Bass Strait between Tasmania and the mainland.
With the success of the first aircraft in Australia, minor changes were made to production aircraft, including a compartment behind the cockpit to carry two specially built suitcase. Although the aircraft was for sale at a modest £700, mainly due to the use of an old but standard engine, it failed to compete with war-surplus sales of converted military aircraft and only eight aircraft were built in total, including a further three to Australia.

<doc id="18553365" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18553365" title="Qualification types (UK)">
Qualification types (UK)

In the UK education sector, there are a wide range of qualification types offered by the United Kingdom awarding bodies. Qualifications range in size and type, can be academic, vocational or skills-related, and are grouped together into different levels of difficulty.
Qualification levels.
Qualifications are grouped together into different levels. Each level corresponds to a particular qualification’s degree of difficulty. However, qualifications within any one level can cover a huge range of subjects and take different amounts of time to complete.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the levels are contained within the National Qualifications Framework. From September 2008, this is being superseded by the Qualifications and Credit Framework. There are nine levels of difficulty in the framework, from entry level to level 8.
http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/qualification-and-assessment-framework/89-articles/250-explaining-the-national-qualifications-framework
Higher education qualifications are also contained in the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ). The FHEQ broadly corresponds with levels 4 to 8 of the NQF.
Scotland has its own education system and its own twelve level system, the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.
AS and A levels.
AS level and A (Advanced) level qualifications focus on traditional study skills. They normally take two years to complete full-time in school or college, and can be taken part-time. AS levels can stand as a qualification in their own right, or become the first half of a full A level (the A2 forms the second half).
AS and A levels are available in a wide range of academic and applied (work-related) subjects, and are often used as entry into higher education.
In Scotland, students usually take Highers and Advanced Highers. 
AS and A levels are at level 3 on the NQF.
Bachelor's degrees.
A bachelor's degree is a course of higher education academic study leading to a qualification such as a bachelor of arts (BA), bachelor of science (BSc), or bachelor of medicine (MB). They are sometimes known as 'ordinary' or 'first' degrees.
A bachelors degree is designed to give learners a thorough understanding of a subject, and usually takes three or four years to complete full-time (some degrees such as medicine can take five or six years).
Bachelors degrees are at level 6 on the NQF.
Diplomas (for 14–19 year olds).
The 14–19 Diploma is a qualification for 14 to 19 year-olds, offering a more practical, hands-on way of gaining the essential skills employers and universities look for. 
From September 2008, Diplomas in five subject areas were made available in selected schools and colleges around the country. Further subjects were added every year until 2011. Currently there are 17 subjects available.
The 14–19 Diplomas are at levels 1 to 3 on the NQF.
Entry level qualifications.
Entry level qualifications are known as 'certificates' or 'awards', and are designed for learners who are not yet ready to take qualifications at level 1 on the NQF.
They may be appropriate for learners who do not have traditional qualifications, or who have been away from learning for a long time. 
They are available in a wide variety of subjects, and at three different levels (all within entry level on the NQF).
Foundation Degrees.
Foundation Degrees are higher education qualifications that combine academic study with workplace learning. They have been designed jointly by universities, colleges and employers, and are available in a range of work-related subjects. They are broadly equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor's degree.
Foundation Degrees are at level 5 on the NQF.
GCSEs.
GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education) are the main qualification taken by 14–16 year olds (adults can take them as well). They are available in a wide range of academic and applied (work-related) subjects, and also as a ‘short-course’ option (equivalent to half a full GCSE).
GCSEs are at levels 1 and 2 on the NQF, depending on the grade achieved.
HNCs and HNDs.
HNCs (Higher National Certificates) and HNDs (Higher National Diplomas) are work-related higher education qualifications. 
HNCs can take one year to complete full-time. HNDs take two years full-time (both can also be studied part-time). They are highly valued by employers, and can also count towards membership of professional bodies and other employer organisations.
HNCs and HNDs are at level 5 on the NQF.
International Baccalaureate.
The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme is an internationally recognised qualification for students aged 16 to 19. It is based around detailed academic study of a wide range of subjects, including languages, the arts, science, maths, history and geography, and leads to a single qualification.
The IB Diploma Programme is at level 3 on the NQF.
Key Skills qualifications.
Key Skills qualifications are designed to develop the skills that are commonly needed in education and training, work and life in general. 
They are available in schools, colleges and from other learning providers, and are also offered by some employers, the armed forces and the Prison Service.
Key Skills can be taken as a stand alone qualification, or as part of other courses (such as an NVQ or some higher education courses). They are also one of the components that make up an Apprenticeship.
Key Skill qualifications are at levels 1 to 4 on the NQF.
Postgraduate qualifications.
Postgraduate qualifications are higher education qualifications that require that learners have already completed a bachelors degree. Most types of postgraduate qualification will include taught and research elements.
Generally, they fall into four categorieed:
Postgraduate qualifications are at levels 7 and 8 on the NQF.
Skills for Life qualifications.
Skills for Life (sometimes referred to as Basic Skills qualifications) are designed to help learners develop their reading, writing, maths and ICT skills. There is also a Skills for Life qualification in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). 
They are available for those learners who are over 16 years of age, have left compulsory full-time education and do not have an up to date English or maths qualification at level 2 (such as a GCSE) on the NQF. In some cases, schools can also offer the qualifications for 14 to 16 year olds.
Skills for Life qualifications are available at entry level to level 2 on the NQF.
Vocational qualifications.
Vocational qualifications are designed to give learners the skills and knowledge to do a particular job, work in a particular industry, or acquire more general skills to do a variety of jobs. 
They are offered by a variety of awarding bodies such as City and Guilds, Edexcel and OCR.
They are available at various levels on the NQF, and in a variety of different sizes.
A range of vocational qualifications include the competence-based National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) that can be taken at work, college, or as part of an Apprenticeship. They are based on national standards for various occupations, and cover the practical, work-related tasks designed to help learners do a job effectively. NVQs are at levels 1 to 5 on the NQF.
Reform of vocational qualifications.
In November 2005, the government established the UK Vocational Qualifications Reform Programme (UKVQRP), to improve the effectiveness of vocational qualifications and other learning programmes across the UK. 
The UKVQRP is managed by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and is supported by the Learning and Skills Network through the Qualification Reform Support Programme.

Postal Services Commission

The Postal Services Commission, known as Postcomm, was a non-ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom charged with overseeing the quality and universal service of post in the United Kingdom. It was established in 2000 under the Postal Services Act 2000. Postcomm was merged into the communications regulator Ofcom on 1 October 2011. 
Most of Postcomm's role involved regulating Royal Mail (for letter delivery and to guarantee a universal postal service) and its two subsidiaries, Post Office Ltd and Parcelforce. Postcomm was also charged with the licensing of the UK's postal operators. It was set up alongside a 'sister' organisation, Postwatch, an independent watchdog for postal services. Postwatch became part of Consumer Focus on 1 October 2008.
In May 2008, Postcomm called for the part-privatisation of Royal Mail to safeguard the universal service. Following the Hooper Report into the future of the postal services industry, in October 2010, Business Secretary Vince Cable confirmed plans for the privatisation of up to 90% of the business and the possible mutualisation of the Post Office. Any purchasing business will be required to retain the universal service of collection and delivery of mail six days a week at affordable prices. Royal Mail staff are to be offered the remaining 10% shares with the Government to take on the group's pension liabilities. The changes were enabled by the Postal Services Act 2011. As part of the plans, the roles fulfilled by Postcomm were absorbed into the communications regulator Ofcom from 1 October 2011.
Statutory basis.
The authority for Postcomm was found in the Postal Services Act 2000, s.1 and Sch.1.

<doc id="18553464" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18553464" title="Silphium perfoliatum">
Silphium perfoliatum

Silphium perfoliatum (cup plant) is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family, native to eastern and central North America. It is an erect herbaceous perennial with triangular toothed leaves, and daisy-like yellow composite flower heads in summer.
The specific epithet "perfoliatum" means "through the leaf."
There are two varieties:-
Description.
The typical height of this plant ranges from . The stem is stout, smooth, slightly hairy (glabrous) strongly 4-angled (square), like mint plants. The leaves are opposite, toothed and ovate. The petioles are widely winged and fused around the stem, forming a cup. The stem terminates in a single flower bud. 
All other species of "Silphium" present in Michigan do not have fused leaf bases.
Flowers.
The flowers, which appear from midsummer to autumn (fall), look very similar to sunflowers, measuring about 2.5 cm in diameter, with golden yellow ray florets. In the middle of the flower there are small, sterile, tubular disk florets, which are structurally bisexual, but the stamens are the only fertile part, and they do not produce fruit. The corollas are tubular, 5-toothed, and the style is undivided.
Seed production.
The ray florets have female characteristics, and eventually develop to become thin brown achenes with a marginal wing utilized for wind dispersal.
Insect pollinators including bees, butterflies, and skippers help to cross-fertilize flowers to produce seeds. 20 to 30 seeds are created in each flower head. Each seed is about 9 to 15 mm long, 6–9 mm wide, flattened in shape, with a thickness of 1 mm.
The plant metabolises by the Type C3 Pathway. This plant is highly adapted to endure extreme weather and inhospitable conditions. For example, during the winter, the roots remain dormant and can survive down to . Its optimal growing temperature is 20 degree Celsius. When flooded it can stay alive for 10 to 15 days.
Habitat and distribution.
"S. perfoliatum" grows in sandy moist bottom lands, floodplains, near stream beds, in or adjacent to open woodland.
Currently, it can be found in the following states: 
USA (AL, AR, CT, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, NC, ND, NE, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, SD, TN, VA, VT, WI, WV), CAN (ON, QC) 
The plant is listed as a threatened species in Michigan.
Cultivation.
During the 1750s, the species was introduced to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and has been prized as an ornamental plant since. It was named in 1759 by Carl Linnaeus. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Other uses.
"S. perfoliatum" is considered to have a high feed value for meat and milk producing farm animals because of its longevity and high protein levels.
The plant produces a resin that has an odor similar to turpentine.
The plant contains a gum and resin; the root has been used medicinally. 
The resin has been made into chewing gum to prevent nausea and vomiting.
Native Americans would cut off the top of the plant stalk and collect the resinous sap that was emitted from the plant. The resin was used for a chewing gum to freshen breath. 
The Winnebagos Tribe believed that a potion made from the rhizome would provide supernatural powers. The people belonging to the tribe would drink this potion before hunting. The people of the Chippewas tribe used the root extract for back and chest pains, to prevent excessive menstruation, and to treat lung hemorrhage. During the spring, the tender young leaves were cultivated as an acceptable food source by cooking or a salad.
The powdered form of "Silphium perfoliatum L." has diaphoretic and tonic properties. It can help alleviate the symptoms of fevers, dry cough, asthma, spleen illness, heart and liver disease. The extract from the leaves of the plant has shown to lower cholesterol and triglycerides levels in blood. Studies show that the presence of phenolic acids is responsible for the species’ antiseptic activity to stimulate generation of IgG and IgM antibodies. In addition, it stimulates bile production of the gall bladder.
"Silphium perfoliatum" contains amino acids, carbohydrates (inulinin rhizomes), L-ascorbic acid, terpenes with essential oils, triterpene saponins, carotenoids, phenolic acid, tannins, and flavonoids.
The long blossoming season and abundance of flowers provides a rich source for bees and the cultivation of honey.
Disease and Herbivory.
This species can be targeted by a fungus called Sclerotinia during the summer. During cool temperatures in autumn, the fungus Botrytis will cause the flower buds to wilt and turn black before blooming.
Eggs of the Gall wasp are deposited within the stems of this plant. Consequently, the developing larvae feed within the stems. 
Goldfinches feed on the seeds of "Silphium perfoliatum" and drink the water collected by the “cups” on the stems. The fact that this species is able to form dense colonies, it provides a good shelter for birds. Herbivores such as cattle and sheep will eat the leaves the plant especially those of young plants.

Jacques Anne Joseph Le Prestre de Vauban

Jacques Anne Joseph Le Prestre de Vauban (10 March 1754, in Dijon – 20 April 1816) was a French general of the Ancien Regime and the French Revolutionary Wars. He was the grandson of Antoine Le Prestre de Vauban - Antoine was nephew to the military architect Vauban.
Entering military service in 1770, he was Rochambeau's aide de camp during the American War of Independence and was sent back to France with the general's dispatches in 1782. He became colonel and second in command of the régiment d'Agenors, and shortly afterwards, the duc d'Orléans, whose chamberlain he was, made him colonel in command of the régiment d'infanterie that took his name and knight of the order of Saint-Louis on 13 June 1784.
Like most other officer of his corps, he emigrated around the time of Louis XVI's flight to
Varennes, going to Ath, then Koblenz, where the comte d'Artois made him his aide de camp. He accompanied him in this role during the campaign of 1792 and on his trip to Russia in 1793, where they were well received by Catherine II of Russia. He then went to England, and in spring 1795 joined the Quiberon expedition. Charged, under Joseph-Geneviève de Puisaye, with commanding a unit of Chouans charged with attacking the rear of the Republican army, he was prevented by the forces of Hoche and, tricked by false signals, forced to retreat. He fulfilled several different missions to the Vendée and the île d'Yeu, with the comte d'Artois. Returning to London, he hastened to return to Russia but arrived there at the moment of Catherine's death, fell victim (like most French Royalists in Russia) to Paul I's changeability and was soon forced to leave. He returned to France and stayed for a time in Paris, with police consent, until he was arrested in 1806 and held prisoner for a long while in the Temple.

Force gauge

A force gauge (also force gage) is a small measuring instrument used across all industries to measure the force during a push or pull test. Applications exist in research and development, laboratory, quality, production and field environment. There are two kinds of force gauges today: mechanical and digital force gauges.
Digital gauge.
A digital force gauge is basically a handheld instrument that contains a load cell, electronic part, software and a display. A load cell is an electronic device that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge converts the deformation (strain) to electrical signals. The software and electronics of the force gauge convert the voltage of the load cell into a force value that is displayed on the instrument.
Test units of force measurements are most commonly newtons or pounds. The peak force is the most common result in force testing applications. It is used to determine if a part is good or not. Some examples of force measurement: door latch, quality of spring, wire testing, strength ... but more complicated tests can be performed like peeling, friction, texture.

Red-lipped batfish

The red-lipped batfish or Galapagos batfish ("Ogcocephalus darwini") is a fish of unusual morphology found around the Galapagos Islands at depths of 30m or more. Red-lipped batfish are closely related to rosy-lipped batfish ("Ogcocephalus porrectus"), which are found near Cocos Island off the coast of Costa Rica. This fish is mainly known for its bright red lips.
Batfish are not good swimmers; they use their highly-adapted pectoral fins to "walk" on the ocean floor. When the batfish reaches maturity, its dorsal fin becomes a single spine-like projection (thought to function primarily as a lure for prey). Similar to the anglerfish, the Red-Lipped Batfish has a structure on its head known as illicium. This structure is employed for attracting prey.
Diet.
The species is a piscivore / invertivore, mainly feeding on other small fish and small crustaceans like shrimps and mollusks 
Conservation Status.
The Red-Lipped Batfish has no known threats.

<doc id="18553576" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18553576" title="Full-spectrum photography">
Full-spectrum photography

Full-spectrum photography is a subset of multispectral imaging, defined among photography enthusiasts as imaging with consumer cameras the full, broad spectrum of a film or camera sensor bandwidth. In practice, specialized broadband/full-spectrum film captures visible and near infrared light, commonly referred to as the "VNIR".
Modified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350 nm to 1000 nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400 nm to 700 nm. Replacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) elements of the color filter array placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet and infrared which may be recorded in any of the red, green or blue channels depending on the particular sensor in use and on the dyes used in the Bayer filter. A converted full-spectrum camera can be used for ultraviolet photography or infrared photography with the appropriate filters.
Uses of full-spectrum photography include fine art photography, geology, forensics & law enforcement, and even some claimed use in ghost hunting.
History.
Full-spectrum photography has its roots in spectral imaging, both multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, which began as early as the late 1950s and early 1960s as means for geological and military remote sensing. Wideband panchromatic film has been available in various forms since the 1920s, when some UV and IR sensitivity remained in commercially available emulsions. The earliest color films sometimes included wider band color than recent commercial photographic emulsions, and can be recognized by the more reddish and or limited color tones of early color prints (not to be confused with print fading).
In the late 1990s enthusiastic photographers began shooting infrared with digital cameras, necessitating either long exposures or the removal of the internal hot mirror. Most replaced the hot mirror with an infrared pass filter of the same optical thickness (to retain focus) and pass only infrared light to achieve results seen with infrared B&W film. Around 2000, electro-optical engineer David Twede, already engaged in VNIR and infrared spectral remote sensing, ventured into Full-spectrum photography art, using a modified digital camera to explore broader spectral imaging and developing art around it. Around 2003, forensics photographers using engineered cameras for specific purposes began modifying off-the-shelf digital cameras to acquire less expensive tools. Full-spectrum photography is used by enthusiasts of ghost hunting, though no claims of actually photographing psychic phenomenon with Full-spectrum or infrared photography have been substantiated.
Today, there are a few places that will modify digital cameras to pass broad, full-spectrum light for full spectral imaging. A few DSLR cameras such as the Fujifilm FinePix IS Pro are purpose-designed for full spectrum use and respond from approximately 1000 nm (IR) to 380 nm (UV).
Basics.
Digital sensors and photographic films can be made to record non-visible ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation. In each case, they generally require special equipment: converted digital cameras, specific filters, highly transmitting lenses, etc. For example, most photographic lenses are made of glass and will filter out most ultraviolet light. Instead, expensive lenses made of quartz must be used. Infrared films may be shot in standard cameras using an infrared pass filters, although focus must compensate for the infrared focal point.
A converted digital camera usually requires that the infrared hot mirror be removed and replaced by a wideband, spectrally flat glass of the same optical path length. Typical glass types used include Schott WG-280 and BK-7, which transmit as much as 90% from around 300 nm to past 1000 nm. Removing the hot mirror is tedious and may require special tools and clean rooms.
Once the camera is sensitive to the full-spectrum, external filters can be used to selectively filter portions of the UV, visible and infrared to achieve various effects. For example, a standard red #25a can be used to include red light and infrared light together, yielding particularly strong two-toned color images of a reddish nature except where the infrared is high and shows as cyan. Another example, using UV/IR filters such as the 18A or U-330 yield a two or three toned image in which blues and yellows dominate. Less common filters have been claimed to give a variety of color effects ranging from diverse pastel foliage and deep blue skies to surrealistic effects of the sky and ground, though digital image processing is likely required to achieve the full effects. One issue with Full-spectrum photography in either film or digital photogrqaphy is the chromatic aberration produced by the wideband information. That is, different spectra, including the ultraviolet and infrared, will focus at different focal points, yielding blurry images and color edge effects, depending on the focal length used. There are specialized lenses such as the Nikon 105mm f4.5 UV-Nikkor which are designed to eliminate this chromatic aberration.
It is important to note that while the converted camera sensor is capable of recording in both the ultraviolet and infrared region, when mixed light hits the sensor it will be the longer infrared waves that will predominate in the recording. Little or no shortwave ultraviolet light may be recorded unless selective filtering is applied to cut some or all of the infrared light. The longwave infrared light may also wash out a considerable amount of the visible light in the blue and green areas in a full spectrum photograph. Similarly if infrared light is entirely blocked, the visible light can overwhelm the recording of the ultraviolet light. So there is no truly full-spectrum photograph that can be made.
Full-spectrum photography achieves various effects and surrealistic colors from the interaction of reflectivity (UV, visible, IR) of nature and man made materials and the specific spectral transmission of the red, green and blue filters on the camera. The addition of external filters will reduce and emphasize different interactions, yielding different effects.
Applications.
Art.
Full-spectrum Photography is being used for art photography and can yield colors similar to visible color film, but with a brightness and tonality of infrared photographs. Most full-spectrum art is of landscapes. A movement is also building for artistic human photography with Full-spectrum photography, that captures a real person interacting with a surreal landscape. Full-spectrum photography art is displayed at galleries in Colorado and Florida.
Science hobbyists.
Hyperspectral and most multispectral cameras are expensive and difficult to operate, requiring a computer acquisition and laborious post-processing. Modified digital cameras with the proper filtering avail some limited spectral sensing for geology/mineralogy, agriculture and oceanographic purposes. Most consumer cameras retain the red, green and blue micro-filters, thus limiting their usefulness in scientific imaging.
Forensics.
Forensics imaging often uses Full-spectrum cameras to emphasize non-visible materials which have more diverse reflectivities in the ultraviolet and infrared. Applications include non-visible inks (uv & ir), disturbed soil (uv & ir), gunshot residue (ir), body fluids (uv), fibers, etc. Analogous to forensics, Full-spectrum cameras are being explored to enhance photographic recordings of archeological findings.

Plot.
The plot centers around, Joe, the last of the humans remaining that can overturn the robot regime. Nothing can stop him from destroying the control system which forces the robots to kill. In the latter half of the 21st century, robots have been engaged in labor in dangerous places, housework, etc. Then suddenly, the control system used to function these robots plotted a revolt against the human race, and ordered every robot to annihilate all of the people. The robots robbed them of their weapons, and occupied various military bases and factories.
The war robots that were manufactured there murdered men one after another, and the survivors organized a resistance and went into a full-scale offensive against the enemy's army.

Aegialomys

Aegialomys is a genus of oryzomyine rodents from the lowlands and mountains of western Peru and Ecuador, including the Galápagos Islands. The species in this genus have historically been placed in "Oryzomys", but according to cladistic research, the genus is more closely related to a group containing, among others, "Nectomys" and "Sigmodontomys", than to "Oryzomys". The generic name "Aegialomys" means "coastal mouse" in Ancient Greek ( "coast" and "mouse") and references the mostly coastal occurrence of the genus.
"Aegialomys" species have a greyish to buff dorsal pelage which is divided sharply from the white to light yellow ventral pelage. They have relatively short ears. There are crowns of hair at the bases of the toes. The tail is equal to or longer than the body and is darker above than below.
There are two commonly recognized and described species in the genus: the mainland "A. xanthaeolus", the type species, and "A. galapagoensis". There is however a third, undescribed species occurring on the Ecuadorean coast and the status of the two junior synonyms of "A. xanthaeolus", "ica" Osgood, 1944 and "baroni" J.A. Allen, 1897, is currently unresolved. Also, the subspecies "A. galapagoensis bauri" is sometimes considered a separate species.

Tom Caplan

Tom Caplan is a Canadian, Montreal-based Marriage and Family Therapist. He is an Adjunct professor of the School of Social Work at McGill University, Clinical Director of the Caplan Therapy Centre and the Montreal Anger Management centre, and Director and Supervisor of the McGill Domestic Violence Clinic, with research affiliations with McGill University, Douglas Hospital, and Concordia University. He is also a designated expert in Domestic Violence for the Quebec Court System.
Caplan does clinical work with forensic populations, is the Clinical Director of the Caplan Therapy Centre and is the founder and supervisor of the Montreal Anger Management Centre. He is on the editorial board of Social Work with Groups, is a certified marriage and family therapist and a certified marriage and family therapy supervisor (A.A.M.F.T.), an internationally certified alcohol and drug counsellor (I.C.A.D.C.) and a member of the Professional Order of Social Workers of Quebec (OPTSQ).
Caplan's signature therapeutic model is the Needs ABC model of therapy.
Academic background.
Caplan received a Master's Degree in Chemistry From the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and a Master's in Counselling Psychology from the Adler School of professional Psychology and later studied under Annette Werk and Judy Magill, among others, at McGill University, with an initial focus on the theory and practice of delivery of therapy in a group environment to men involved in domestic violence. There he received a Master's degree in Social Work.
Caplan's focus has historically been on group therapy and his model has been extended to encompass couple and family work, which can be considered as a subset of group therapy, with the couple and/or family seen as a "small group".
Needs ABC; a psychotherapeutic model.
Needs ABC is unique in that it distinguishes itself by its focus on client relational needs and the emotions they predict, rather than on specific client behaviors. The primary caveat of the model states:
Three important goals govern the Needs ABC:
Needs ABC is an integrative model within the larger umbrella of cognitive behavioral therapy.
Relational Needs.

Reliability (Availability)
Loyalty (Trust)
Respect (Self-Worth)
Competence (Self-Efficacy)
SECONDARY
Intimacy (Closeness/Distance)
Power (to Get Needs Met)

Maria Salviati

Maria Salviati (17 July 1499 – 29 December 1543) was an Italian noblewoman, the daughter of Lucrezia di Lorenzo de' Medici and Jacopo Salviati. She married Giovanni dalle Bande Nere and was the mother of Cosimo I de Medici. Her husband died 30 November 1526, leaving her a widow at the age of 27. Salviati never remarried; after her husband's death she adopted the somber garb of a novice, which is how she is remembered today as numerous late portraits show her attired in black and white.
Family.
Maria Salviati was born in Florence. She descended from two of Florence's most powerful banking families: the Salviati on her father's side, and the Medici on her mother's. Salviati's maternal grandfather was Lorenzo "il Magnifico", a well-known politician and grandson to Cosimo de' Medici the Elder. 
In turn, Salviati's descendants became crowned figureheads of Europe over the succeeding generations. Her son, Cosimo I de' Medici, was crowned Duke when his cousin Alessandro was assassinated in 1537. Her grandson Francesco I de' Medici married Johanna of Austria; they were the parents of Eleonora de' Medici, who married Vincenzo I Gonzaga and was the mother of Francesco IV Gonzaga. Francesco and Johanna's other daughter was Marie de' Medici, who married Henry IV of France and was the mother of Louis XIII of France and Henrietta Maria of France. Louis was the father of Louis XIV of France, Henrietta Maria was the mother of Charles II of England and James II of England.
Bia de' Medici.
Maria set up residence at Villa di Castello in northern Florence, there she would look after her grandchildren. Her son Cosimo had an illegitimate daughter called Bia de' Medici. Maria described her granddaughter as a very happy and chatty little girl, often having long conversations with her. 
Cosimo married in 1539 to Eleonora di Toledo. Gossip reports that Eleonora refused to tolerate Bia's presence in the palace after their marriage so Cosimo sent Bia off to live with Maria. Other sources say that Eleonora brought Bia up very lovingly. Bia shared a nursery with Giulia de' Medici an illegitimate daughter of Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence, the pair were close in age so they got along very well with each other. Maria knew who Bia's mother was but she would never tell Bia or anyone else the name of the woman. Both Bia and her cousin Giulia contracted a fast-moving fever, Giulia recovered from the illness but Bia didn't, Cosimo would often write to Maria asking her of Bia's condition. Bia became sicker and sicker and eventually died on March 1, 1542 aged only five years. Maria and Cosimo were said to be very sad by her loss, Maria carried on looking after Giulia.
Maria died one year after Bia on December 29, 1543. This was an awful loss for Cosimo, two very loving females had been taken from him in the space of two years.

<doc id="18553652" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18553652" title="Bowel management">
Bowel management

Bowel management is a medical approach to manage fecal incontinence or constipation. Bowel control is often a challenge for children who are born with anomalies in their anus or rectum, Hirschsprung's disease, and/or spina bifida. Some patients have a poor prognosis and will never be able to control their bowel, and so benefit from bowel management techniques.
Overview.
Bowel management is mainly achieved through a daily enema which empties the colon to prevent unwanted and uncontrolled bowel movements that day. Some people also use laxatives and a controlled diet as part of their bowel management regimen. Determining the appropriate regimen to achieve successful bowel management is done under medical supervision. Care is tailored to suit each child and often requires a trial and error approach over the course of a week. The patient has an X-ray taken which is reviewed by their doctor. The doctor then recommends a course of action (e.g. enemas, laxative, and/or controlled diet). The next day, the process is repeated with modifications to help the child achieve a completely empty colon. After the course of this week the doctor can determine the precise amount and combination of what the child needs to achieve bowel management. From then on the patient can continue the regimen on their own.
Bowel management does not cure fecal incontinence, but can greatly increase quality of life. With successful bowel management, a child may be more apt to establish independence in normal daily life. Children with severe incontinence may also be able to attend school and participate in activities they otherwise would never be able to.
Depending on the prognosis, some patients will continue using these techniques for life while others may gain some degree of bowel control and become "potty trained". Children who practice bowel management often become unhappy as they age, especially at puberty, due to feeling that the administration of enemas is an intrusion on their privacy, especially as it is difficult for them to administer the enema themselves. An operation called a continent appendicostomy or "Malone procedure" is available. This allows a person to give themselves an enema by inserting a catheter into a small orifice at the belly button.
Fecal incontinence.
The medical definition of fecal incontinence is the incapacity to voluntarily hold feces in the rectum. There are two subgroups to those with fecal incontinence: Real fecal incontinence and Pseudoincontinence.
Real fecal incontinence.
For a child with real fecal incontinence, the normal mechanism of bowel control is not working. An alteration of the muscles that surround the anorectal canal along with poor sphincters (those muscles which control the anus) are responsible for fecal incontinence in children operated on for anorectal malformations with a bad prognosis. Some patients operated on for Hirschsprung's disease have this anatomic problem as do those with spinal problems. The supply of nerve connections of these muscles is important for their correct function. A deficit of nerve connections occurs in anorectal anomalies as well as in other conditions. In cases of spina bifida, or following spinal cord injury, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles, as well as sensation, are deficient. The presence and the passage of feces and the perception of the difference between solid and liquid feces and gas are limited.
Pseudoincontinence.
In cases of pseudoincontinence, a child is believed to suffer from fecal incontinence. However, investigation shows that he or she suffers from severe constipation and fecal impaction. When the impaction is treated and the patient receives enough laxatives to pass stool, he or she becomes continent.
Candidates for Bowel Management.
Children who suffer from fecal incontinence after the repair of an imperforate anus are usually those born with a bad prognosis type of defect and severe associated defects (defect of the sacrum, poor muscle complex). However, such children can still achieve a good quality of life when treated with the bowel management program. Children operated on for imperforate anus and who suffer from fecal incontinence can be divided into two groups that require individualized treatment plans:
Children with Constipation (Colonic Hypomotility) No special diet or medications are necessary for children with colonic hypomotility, a type of constipation. Their tendency towards constipation helps them to remain clean between enemas. The real challenge is to find an enema capable of cleaning the colon completely. Soiling episodes or "accidents" occur when there is an incomplete cleaning of the bowel.
Children with Loose Stools and Diarrhea (Colonic Hypermotility) This group of children has an overactive colon. Rapid transit of stool results in frequent episodes of diarrhea. This means that even when an enema cleans the colon rather easily, stool keeps on passing fairly quickly from the cecum to the descending colon and the anus. To prevent this, a constipating diet and/or medications to slow down the colon are necessary. Eliminating foods that further loosen bowel movements will help the colon to slow down. Those who experience hypermotility may have to follow a constipating diet and avoid laxative foods. The diet is rigid and includes food such as banana, apple, baked bread, white pasta with no sauce, boiled meat, and others, while fried foods and dairy products are avoided.

Sarah Thomson (actor)

Sarah Thomson (born July 17, 1985) is a New Zealand actress, who is known for playing roles in two series of the "Power Rangers" franchise, and for her role in New Zealand's longest running soap opera, "Shortland Street".
Career.
After high school (Glendowie College), Thomson moved to Christchurch to film the first sections of the troubled American feature called "Meet Me in Miami" (then titled "My Gardener"). Since Thomson's contribution, the film has been re-edited, re-written and re-cast. Little of the original feature remains. Although Thomson was discouraged from acting by her experiences, she then returned to her hometown of Auckland to focus on friends and family.
Drawn back to stage, she ended up performing outdoor Shakespeare, as part of The University of Auckland's long-running "Summer Shakespeare" tradition. She was not a student at this time, but later enrolled to study Film, Television, Media Studies and Theatre Studies.

Mines and Collieries Act 1842

Mines and Collieries Act 1842 (c. 99), commonly known as the Mines Act of 1842, was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It prohibited all females and boys under ten years old from working underground in coal mines. It was a response to the working conditions of children revealed in the Children's Employment Commission (Mines) 1842 report. The Commission was headed by Lord Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury.
At the beginning of the 19th century methods of coal extraction were primitive and the workforce, men, women and children, laboured in dangerous conditions. In 1841 about 216,000 people were employed in the mines. Women and children worked underground for 11 or 12 hours a day for smaller wages than men. The public became aware of conditions in the country's collieries in 1838 after a freak accident at Huskar Colliery in Silkstone, near Barnsley. A stream overflowed into the ventilation drift after violent thunderstorms causing the death of 26 children; 11 girls aged from 8 to 16 and 15 boys between 9 and 12 years of age. The disaster came to the attention of Queen Victoria who ordered an inquiry.
Lord Ashley headed the royal commission of inquiry which investigated the conditions of workers especially children in the coal mines in 1840. Commissioners visited collieries and mining communities gathering information sometimes against the mine owners' wishes.The report, illustrated by engraved illustrations and the personal accounts of mineworkers was published in May 1842. Victorian society was shocked to discover that children, as young as five or six worked as "trappers", opening and shutting ventilation doors down the mine before becoming "hurriers", pushing coal tubs. Lord Ashley deliberately appealed to Victorian prudery, focussing on girls and women wearing trousers and working bare breasted in the presence of boys and men which "made girls unsuitable for marriage and unfit to be mothers". Such an affront to Victorian morality ensured the bill was passed.

Siege of Belgrade (1688)

The Siege of Belgrade in 1688 was the fourth siege of that city, taking place during the Great Turkish War. 
Belgrade was at that time a part of the Ottoman Empire, and had been for 167 years. The Ottoman Empire was at war with the Holy League, the forces of which were led by the elector of Bavaria, Maximilian II Emanuel. The Austrians were also accompanied by many Serbian volunteers under the command of Jovan Monasterlija.
Maximilian laid siege to the city on 30 July 1688 and subjected it to cannon fire for nearly a month. Upon refusal of his offer to accept the Turkish garrison's surrender, Maximilian ordered an assault on 6 September. At first the Imperial forces wavered, but Maximilian, accompanied by Prince Eugene of Savoy, rallied the forces and drove the garrison from the walls. 
Maximilian's forces lost 4,000 men in the assault, while the Turks lost 5,000. They would hold the city for two years, until the Turks returned to besiege it in 1690.

Fart Proudly

[[Image:Franklin-Benjamin-LOC.jpg|thumb|rightt|Franklin punned that compared to his ruminations on flatulence, other scientific investigations were "scarcely worth a 
FART-HING"]]
"Fart Proudly" (also called "A Letter To A Royal Academy", and "To the Royal Academy of Farting") is the popular name of a "notorious essay" about flatulence written by Benjamin Franklin circa 1781 while he was living abroad as United States Ambassador to France.
Description.
"A Letter To A Royal Academy" was composed in response to a call for scientific papers from the Royal Academy of Brussels. Franklin believed that the various academic societies in Europe were increasingly pretentious and concerned with the impractical. Revealing his "bawdy, scurrilous side," Franklin responded with an essay suggesting that research and practical reasoning be undertaken into methods of improving the odor of human flatulence. 
The essay was never submitted but was sent as a letter to Richard Price, a Welsh philosopher in England with whom Franklin had an ongoing correspondence. The text of the essay's introduction reads in part:
I have perused your late mathematical Prize Question, proposed in lieu of one in Natural Philosophy, for the ensuing year...Permit me then humbly to propose one of that sort for your consideration, and through you, if you approve it, for the serious Enquiry of learned Physicians, Chemists, &c. of this enlightened Age. It is universally well known, that in digesting our common food, there is created or produced in the bowels of human creatures, a great quantity of wind. That the permitting this air to escape and mix with the atmosphere, is usually offensive to the company, from the fetid smell that accompanies it. That all well-bred people therefore, to avoid giving such offence, forcibly restrain the efforts of nature to discharge that wind.
The essay goes on to discuss the way different foods affect the odor of flatulence and to propose scientific testing of farting. Franklin also suggests that scientists work to develop a drug, "holesome and not disagreeable", which can be mixed with "common Food or Sauces" with the effect of rendering flatulence "not only inoffensive, but agreeable as Perfumes". The essay ends with a pun saying that compared to the practical applications of this discussion, other sciences are "scarcely worth a FART-HING."
Copies of the essay were privately printed by Franklin at his printing press in Passy. Franklin distributed the essay to friends including Joseph Priestley (a chemist famous for his work on gases). After Franklin's death, the essay was long excluded from published collections of Franklin's writing but it was included in "Fart Proudly: Writings of Benjamin Franklin You Never Read in School", a 1990 collection of Franklin's humorous and satirical writings.

<doc id="18553798" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18553798" title="CODESYS">
CODESYS

CODESYS (an acronym for controller development system, previously stylised CoDeSys) is a development environment for programming controller applications according to the international industrial standard IEC 61131-3.
Introduction.
CODESYS is developed and marketed by the German software company 3S-Smart Software Solutions located in the Bavarian town of Kempten. Version 1.0 was released in 1994. CODESYS licenses are free of charge and can be installed legally without copy protection on further workstations.
The software tool covers different aspects of industrial automation technology with one surface.
Engineering.
All five programming languages for application programming defined in the IEC 61131-3 are available in the CODESYS development environment.
Additional graphical editor available in CODESYS not defined in the IEC standard:
Integrated compilers transform the application code created by CODESYS into native machine code (binary code) which is then downloaded onto the controller. The most important 16 and 32-bit CPU families are supported, such as C166, TriCore, 80x86, ARM/Cortex, Power Architecture, SH, MIPS, BlackFin and more.
Once CODESYS is online, it offers an extensive debugging functionality such as variable monitoring/writing/forcing by setting breakpoints/performing single steps or recording variable values online on the controller in a ring buffer (Sampling Trace).
CODESYS V3.x is based on the so-called CODESYS Automation Platform, an automation framework device manufacturers can extend by their own plug-in modules.
The CODESYS Professional Developer Edition offers the option to add components to the tool which are subject to licensing, e.g. integrated UML support, a connection to the Apache Subversion version control system or static code analysis of the application code.
The free of charge CODESYS Application Composer lets users create complete automation applications with the IEC 61131-3 tool. Machines or plants can be configured based on modules, e.g. defining the mechatronic construction or the used software functionality including the whole functionality of the project. An integrated configurator generates visible IEC 61131-3 code out of this configuration.
Runtime.
After implementing the CODESYS Control Runtime System, intelligent devices can be programmed with CODESYS. A charged-for toolkit provides this runtime system as a source and object code. It can be ported to different platforms.
Fieldbus technology.
Different field busses can be used directly in the programming system CODESYS. For this purpose, the tool integrates configurators for the most common system such as Profibus, CANopen, EtherCAT, Profinet or Ethernet IP. For some systems, additional protocol stacks are available in the form of CODESYS libraries which can be loaded subsequently.
By means of an FDT Frame Plug-In, additional device specific user interfaces from third-party suppliers can be integrated. Communication between these interfaces will be realised through a communication device type manager (DTM).
Visualization.
An integrated editor helps the user create complex visualization masks directly in the programming system CODESYS and animate them based on application variables. To simplify the procedure, integrated visualization elements are available. An optional toolkit enables the user to create his own visualization elements. The masks created are, among others, used for application tests and commissioning during online operation of the programming system. In combination with optional visualization clients, the masks can also be used to operate machines or plants, e. g. on controllers with integrated display, in web browsers or a portable runtime under Windows or Linux.
SoftMotion.
An optional modular solution for controlling complex movements with an IEC 61131-3 programmed controller is also completely integrated in the programming system CODESYS. The modular solution includes:
Safety.
To reach the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) required after a risk analysis, all system components have to comply to this level.
Pre-certified software components within CODESYS make it much easier for device manufacturers to have their controllers SIL2 or SIL3 certified. Therefore, CODESYS Safety consists of components within the programming system and the runtime system, whereas the project planning is completely integrated in the IEC 61131-3 programming environment.
Industrial usage.
Over 250 device manufacturers from different industrial sectors offer intelligent automation devices with a CODESYS programming interface. Consequently, thousands of end users such as machine or plant builders around the world employ CODESYS for all sorts of automation tasks.
The CODESYS Device Directory offers an overview on nearly 400 devices programmable with CODESYS from leading manufacturers from the sectors control engineering, automation components and embedded systems.

The 149 Squadron "Shikra" of the Republic of Singapore Air Force is a fighter-bomber squadron based at Paya Lebar Air Base, the squadron goes by the motto ""Steadfast"" with the Shikra adopted as its mascot.
History.
Based at Paya Lebar Air Base, 149 Squadron was inaugurated on 1 June 1985 as one of the RSAF's fighter squadrons operating in the interceptor role. The squadron initially operated the supersonic F-5E/F Tiger II fighter aircraft, but has been operating the improved F-5S/T Tiger-IIs fighter aircraft since the early 1990s, these were retrofitted with new state-of-the-art avionics giving the aircraft capability of carrying out both Air-to Air and Air-to-Ground missions.
On 5 April 2010, the squadron was re-inaugurated by Defense Minister Teo Chee Hean in an RSAF ceremony at Paya Lebar Air Base, with the arrival of five F-15SG Strike fighters flown back the week before from Mountain Home AFB.
Achievements.
The squadron found itself actively involved in several major multilateral exercises such as Exercise Bersama Shield and Bersama Lima under the ambit of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), and Exercise Cope Tiger with the US and Thailand air forces in the year of 2007. Also, the squadron has won the Best Fighter Squadron award (Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition) for the fifth time in 2008; its past achievements being in 1987, 1988, 2002 and 2004.

Marksman Shooting & Trap Shooting is a light gun shooter compilation game released for Sega Master System in North America in 1986. A third game, "Safari Hunt", was included in the European version, retitled Marksman Shooting / Trap Shooting / Safari Hunt. "Safari Hunt" was also bundled with "Hang-On" as part of another multicart and also as a built-in game in Version 2.4 of the Master System BIOS.
In each game, players must use the Light Phaser to shoot targets and beat the qualification score before moving on to the next round. Failure to qualify results in an instant game over.
Gameplay.
Players select from one of three separate games. In each of the three games, players must use the Light Phaser to shoot targets and score a set number of points. The targets vary in each game. "Marksman Shooting" has players shoot red dots on targets at a shooting range. The second game, "Trap Shooting" simulates the sport of the same name as players shoot at flying targets.
"Safari Hunt" is similar to "Duck Hunt" for the NES, requiring the player to shoot at various animals. The player must score a certain amount of points by shooting the animals with a limited amount of bullets to move to the next level.

Frenchman's Creek (film)

"Frenchman's Creek" is a 1944 adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novel (about an aristocratic English woman who falls in love with a French pirate), released by Paramount Pictures. The film starred Joan Fontaine, Arturo de Córdova, Basil Rathbone, Cecil Kellaway, and Nigel Bruce. Filmed in Technicolor, it was directed by Mitchell Leisen. The musical score was by Victor Young, who incorporated the main theme of French composer Claude Debussy's "Clair de Lune" as the love theme for the film.
The film is a mostly faithful adaptation of the novel, taking place during the reign of Charles II in the mid seventeenth century, mostly in the Cornish region of England.
Fontaine was under contract to independent producer to David O. Selznick, who only produced a few films each year. Typically, he loaned out his contract players and director Alfred Hitchcock (who had a contract with Selznick from 1940 to 1947) to other studios. In this case, Fontaine was loaned to Paramount for this lavish production. She later complained about her work with director Leisen and some of her costars.
Although the film has not been released on DVD, it has been shown on American Movie Classics.
Awards.
The film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Hans Dreier, Ernst Fegté, Sam Comer).

Bananas Unpeeled

Bananas Unpeeled is a 26 minute film shot in Latin America and the Caribbean, investigating the social and environmental issues faced by Plantation workers and small farmers in the Caribbean.
It examines fair trade policies and labeling as a positive alternative for workers on plantations where harsh working conditions and environmental damage are the norm.
The film was made by independent film-maker Nick Shaw and introduced by the political activist and comedian Mark Thomas.
This educational resource (the film and corresponding teacher action booklet) was quickly taken up by leading British NGO's (OXFAM, People & Planet). Used extensively by schools, universities, trade union organisations, etc., it helped with the introduction of the "fair trade banana" into Great Britain. The Co-Op UK supermarket chain was the first to introduce Fair trade Bananas into their stores. To date, several other supermarket chains have followed this example (e.g. Waitrose, Sainsbury's).
The story behind the making of the film is mentioned in the 2008 book "Fighting the Banana Wars and other Fairtrade Battles" by Harriet Lamb, C.B.E., director of the Fairtrade Foundation (UK).

American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine

The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) is a professional organization for physicians specializing in Hospice and Palliative Medicine, headquartered in Chicago, IL. Membership is open to all health care providers committed to improving the care of patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses. AAHPM has nearly 5,000 members; 82 percent are physicians, 12 percent are nurses or other health care providers and 6 percent are residents or students.
AAHPM started a patient website to help educate the public on the importance of hospice and palliative care.
Background.
AAHPM was founded in 1988, with 250 charter members, as the Academy of Hospice Physicians (The Academy). Josefina B. Magno, MD, president of the International Hospice Institute and Gerald Holman, MD, director of St. Anthony’s Hospice and Life Enrichment Center met to discuss the formation of The Academy.
During the next few years, members worked to build the association by educating people on the importance of hospice care through newsletters and position statements. The Academy worked on publishing a quarterly newsletter and a physician self-study series. In 1994, The Academy was awarded a grant from the National Cancer Institute to develop a book series.
The American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was incorporated by the Academy in May 1996. They offered their first certifying exam later that year. The Academy gained approval from the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), which allowed it to provide CME to physicians. The Academy also changed its name to the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM).
By the turn of the century, AAHPM’s membership grew, and it secured a seat in the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates.
AAHPM’s strong presence and position on highly controversial subjects has made the Academy a prominent voice in hospice and palliative care. In 2003, AAHPM was able to develop its infrastructure and establish the College of Palliative Care with a $1.2-million grant from Open Society Institute’s Project on Death in America.
Position statements.
AAHPM tracks critical issues and provides members with the information, tools, and training required to be effective advocates for their patients and their practice. In recent years, AAHPM has promoted policies that would increase the number of palliative medicine specialists, expand support for research, and improve access to palliative care services for patients with serious illness and their families.
Publications.
The Academy publishes a variety of resources for hospice and palliative care professionals, including: Primer of Palliative Care, Hospice and Palliative Care Training for Physicians: UNIPAC, and Hospice Medical Director Manual.
Educational Offerings.
AAHPM, together with the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association (HPNA), sponsors an educational conference each year. The AAHPM & HPNA Annual Assembly provides disease updates and sessions on the latest advances in clinical research, cultural, ethical and legal, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of care for physicians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and others who practice hospice and palliative care. 
Annual Assembly Sites:
AAHPM also offers educational courses during the year which focus on topics of interest to hospice and palliative care professionals.

The Montreal Montagnards were an early amateur ice hockey team in Canada, organized in the early 1900s. The club is notable as one of the first teams made up of francophone players, the sport having been dominated until that time by players of English or Scottish descent.
History.
The Montagnards were founded around 1900. They were an intermediate team in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) from 1900 until 1902.
The Montagnards were a member of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), set up as a rival to the CAHL from 1904 until 1908. The club had little success in its first two seasons. In 1906-07, the Montagnards were leading the FAHL league, but after the Cornwall team used two professionals from the Montreal Shamrocks, the club protested the game. The protest was lost and the Montagnards resigned from the league to protect their amateur status. The team would return to the league for one final season, the next season. At the end of the 1907-08 FAHL season, the FAHL became a professional league and the Montagnards left the league to continue as an amateur team. The team continued play in various Quebec leagues, including the Montreal City Senior Hockey League.

Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell

Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell (20 May 1792 – 10 October 1883), styled Lord Kilworth until 1822, was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat.
Background and education.
Lord Kilworth was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell and Margaret King, daughter of Robert King, 2nd Earl of Kingston. His mother's views on the education and treatment of children had been formed by her time as a pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. He was a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge.
Career.
Lord Mount Cashell spent some time in Switzerland and married in 1819 Anna Marie Wyse/Wyss (c. 1793-1876) of Berne. The couple then lived for a time in Frankfurt, Germany and would have four daughters and three sons.
In 1826 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer and was able to take a seat in the House of Lords. 
In 1833 the family left Europe for British North America and settled in Lobo Township in the London District (later Lobo Township in Middlesex County, Ontario). Using the services of an agent Lord Mount Cashell purchased from the estate of the late Captain John Matthews, an Upper Canadian politician and former officer in the Royal Artillery who had come to British North America in the retinue of Governor-General Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond. Settling on the former Matthews' estate Mount Cashell built – by Upper Canadian standards – a large home for his family and servants. During his time in Upper Canada (later Canada West and then Ontario) he sometimes ran foul of local authorities by asserting his rights as an elected representative peer in the Irish Peerage. Local folklore indicates that Mount Cashell had a propensity to use a pistol to shoot at flies who infiltrated his home. On October 1, 1865 Mount Cashell's lawyer, H.C.R. Becher, based at nearby London, Ontario, confided in his diary that "The Earl of Mountcashell dines with me often. He is a troublesome client, rather amusing as a guest at first, but in the main a bore." Various members of the family travelled between Britain and the lands in British North America and Mount Cashell's daughter-in-law, Jane Dance, wife of the Hon. George F. Moore died at the Lobo property in 1868 and was buried in a local cemetery. 
In 1847 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society 
By 1870 the family had wound up its dealings in the area and returned to Britain. Mount Cashell was said, when between 85 and 90, to have been engaged to marry a Miss Kennedy. He died ín Paddington, London, aged 91 in October 1883 and was succeeded by his son Stephen Moore, 4th Earl Mount Cashell (1825–1889) who was in turn succeeded by his younger brother Charles William Moore, 5th Earl Mount Cashell (1826–1898).

Gustaw Przeczek

Gustaw Przeczek (; 30 May 1913 – 21 February 1974) was a Polish writer, poet, teacher and activist from the Zaolzie region of Cieszyn Silesia.
He was born in a large coal miner's family in the village of Łazy which lies in the coal basin. He graduated from schools in Orłowa and Łazy and in 1933 from a teachers' seminary in Ostrava. Przeczek later taught as a teacher in Polish schools in Bystrzyca and Łazy.
During World War II he was arrested during mass arrests of Polish intelligentsia and in 1940-1945 incarcerated in Dachau and Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camps. In the latter camp Przeczek was forced to quarry granite in "Gusen" and "Kastenhofen" stone pits.
After the war he administered a Polish school in Orłowa and in 1951-1970 was a director of the Polish elementary school in Trzyniec. Przeczek leaned towards communism and in 1954-1960 was a member of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia from the Communist Party. He was there a member of the Cultural Committee. He was also active in several cultural and literary organizations, most notably the Polish Cultural and Educational Union and its Literary-Artistic Section. Przeczek edited and contributed to Polish magazines for children "Jutrzenka" and "Ogniwo", and wrote several textbooks for Polish schools in Czechoslovakia. He was also a member of Polish editorial staff of the "Profil" publishing house in Ostrava.
Przeczek wrote poetry, prose and also plays. His literary work is influenced by his incarceration in Nazi concentration camps. In Mauthausen-Gusen Przeczek met other poets, Poles Konstanty Ćwierk, Mieczysław Paszkiewicz, Grzegorz Timofiejew and Zdzisław Wróblewski; and Czech Raimund Habřina. They wrote poems on a paper from cement bags; these poems spread among inmates and were recited. Przeczek's first works after his return focused on the life in the concentration camp. He published his camp poems in 1946 in the poetry collection "Serce na kolczastych drutach" (Heart on the Barbed Wire), his experiences from the camp were published in 1948 in the book "Kamienna Golgota" (Stony Golgotha).
Przeczek's motive of hard labour in the concentration camp can be observed from the fragment of "Z lagrowej ulicy" (From the Camp Street) poem from his poetry collection "Serce na kolczastych drutach" (Heart on the Barbed Wire):
Gustaw Przeczek died on 21 February 1974 in a hospital in Hradec Králové during a heart operation and is buried in Trzyniec.

HM Prison Elmley

HM Prison Elmley is a local Category B/C men's prison, located close to the village of Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. The term 'local' means that this prison holds people on remand to the local courts. Elmley forms part of the Sheppey prisons cluster, which also includes HMP Standford Hill and HMP Swaleside. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.
History.
Elmley is a purpose built prison opened in 1992, and is one of six Bullingdon design prisons in England. A new Category C Unit was opened at the prison in 1997, making Elmley the largest of the three prisons within the Sheppey Cluster.
in 2000 it emerged that Elmley Prison had a serious infestation of fleas, affecting both inmates and staff at the prison. 
In a 2003 report Elmley Prison was praised for making noticeable improvements, despite being overcrowded. However the report also raised concerns about the number of prisoners who were being held two together in cells designed for one. The report also highlighted the lack of resources for dealing with foreign nationals in the prison.
The problem of overcrowding at Elmley Prison was highlighted again in 2004 in a report from the Independent Monitoring Board. The report also criticised Emley for its staff shortages which meant that prisoners had less time out of their cells. 
Overcrowding was identified as a key concern again in a report in 2007 on Elmley Prison. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons report stated support for prisoners in the early days of custody in Elmley was "seriously compromised" because of "acute population pressures"
The prison today.
Elmley Prison holds unsentenced and sentenced adult men and unsentenced male young offenders from all of the courts in the county of Kent. Accommodation at the prison comprises five House Blocks holding between 183 and 240 prisoners each in single, double and treble cells. A sixth House Block has recently opened and houses the remaining 282 prisoners.
Education at the prison concentrates on improving key and basic skills as well as Information Technology, Art, ESOL and Employment skills courses. The PE department offers a range of qualifications and in conjunction with Charlton Athletic F.C., offers a range of football qualifications. In addition the prison works with the local Primary Care Trust to offer Health trainer Qualifications and Social Care NVQ. 
Daily employment is also available at Elmley in horticulture, environmental services and recycling, production workshops, laundry, industrial cleaning and catering. Vocational training qualifications are offered in virtually all work areas.
There is a staffed visitors centre at Elmley Prison. Facilities include an unsupervised children's play area and a canteen. Canteen facilities also available in visits room.

Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali

Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din bin Abdil-Qadir Al-Hilali, was a 20th-century Islamic scholar from Morocco, most notable for his English translations of Sahih Bukhari and, along with Muhammad Muhsin Khan, the Qur'an, entitled The Noble Qur'an. In addition to Arabic and English, he was also fluent in German, and both traveled and taught in India, Europe and the Middle East.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Hilali was born in Rissani, Morocco, near the oasis of Tafilalt in a valley near Sajalmasah. His birth year according to the Islamic calendar was 1311, coressponding to 1893 on the Gregorian calendar. name Hilali's grandfather moved to Al-Fidah from Kairouan in Tunisia many years before his birth. Hilali belongs to the family of Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.
Hilali memorized the Qur'an by heart when he was twelve years old, making him a Hafiz. When he first delved into Islamic studies, Hilali was a Sufi of the Tijaniyyah Order. After his religious studies, Hilali took the view that Sufism in general and the Tijani order in particular were far from orthodox Sunni practice due to superstitious and even polythesitic beliefs. He began to speak out against the group in Morocco, for which he was persecuted and assaulted multiple times.
In his twenties, Hilali moved to Algeria in order to study Muslim Jurisprudence, moving on to Egypt in 1922. While there, Hilali enrolled in Al-Azhar University only to drop out after being disappointed with the curriculum. Instead, Hilali spent time under the tutelage of Rashid Rida, then returned to Morocco that same year to finish his Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of al-Karaouine. Responding to a call by Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna for Muslim intellectuals of Morocco to share ideas with those elsewhere, Hilali wrote a number of letters to the organization's magazine which were intercepted by authorities of the French colonial empire. Arrested and held for three days without charge, Hilali's release was secured and he fled Morocco. Shortly after he escaped the country, he was sentenced to death in absentia for subversive activity against the French protectorate of Morocco.
In Asia and Europe.
After performing the pilgrimage to Mecca, Hilali moved to India in order to pursue Hadith studies. While there, he worked as head of Arabic studies at Darul-uloom Nadwatul Ulama in Lucknow. After completing his study in India, Hilali spent three years in Iraq before being personally invited by first King of Saudi Arabia Ibn Saud to teach in the Muslim holy land. Hilali taught and led the prayer in Medina at Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Islam's second holiest site, for two years and taught in Mecca at Masjid al-Haram, Islam's most holy site, for one more year.
After finishing his duration of teaching in Mecca, Hilali enrolled in Baghdad University; he also served as an assistant professor while there. Hilali returned briefly to India for a second time, and enrolled in the University of Lucknow as both a student and a teacher, the most prominent of his own being Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi. Shakib Arslan, who was a close friend of Hilali, went through a contact at the German Foreign Office and helped Hilali enroll (again, both as a student and a teacher) at the University of Bonn. He transferred to Humboldt University of Berlin, where he earned his doctoral degree in Arabic literature in 1940.
Return to Morocco, then Iraq, then Morocco, then Saudi Arabia, then Morocco.
Toward the end of World War II, Hilali left Germany for French Morocco, which was rocked with calls for independence. He returned to Iraq in 1947, once again taking up a teaching position at the university in Baghdad. After the 14 July Revolution, Hilali returned to a now-independent Kingdom of Morocco one more time. He was appointed to a teaching position at Mohammed V University in Rabat in 1959 and later at a branch in Fes. In 1968, Saudi Arabian Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz wrote to Hilali requesting that he take up a teaching position at Islamic University of Madinah, of which Bin Baz was the president. Hilali accepted, living in Saudi Arabia for one more time between 1968 and 1974.
In 1974, Hilali permanently retired from teaching, moving to Meknes initially and later to Casablanca, where he owned a house. Hilali died on the 25th of Shawal in the year 1408AH, corresponding to June 22, 1987 Gregorian. He was buried in the neighborhood of Sbata.
Reception.
Views on Hilali within the Muslim world itself - specifically within Sunni Islam- have been positive. Algerian national hero Abdelhamid Ben Badis in particular considered Hilali to be one of the most knowledgeable Muslim clerics of their era.
Hilali was not without critics, especially Western analysts due to his translation of the Qur'an. Western Muslim academics Khaled Abou El Fadl, Khaleel Mohammed and Sheila Musaji criticized Hilali's translation of the Qur'an as bearing an extremely conservative slant.
Works.
Hilali worked with Muhammad Muhsin Khan in the English translation of the meanings of the Qur'an and Sahih Al-Bukhari. Their translation of the Qur'an has been described as ambitious, incorporating commentary from Tafsir al-Tabari, Tafsir ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Qurtubi and Sahih al-Bukhari, all considered canonical works in Sunni Islam.
Hilali also translated the book al-Lulu wa al-Marjan to English during the period of his stay at the Islamic University of Madinah.
Personal life.
Hilali was an adherent of the Zahirite school of Islamic law according to his children and students. Administrators of his website edited his biography to remove all references to his adherence to the school, with which modern-day Zahirites took issue.

European Journal of Epidemiology

The European Journal of Epidemiology is a peer-reviewed medical journal on the epidemiology of communicable and non-communicable diseases and their control. The editor in chief is Albert Hofman (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands)
Origins.
Antiono Sanna, MD, was the founding editor of the journal. As a clinical microbiologist and professor in microbiology in Sienna and the Universita Catolica in Roma, Prof. Sanna was well versed in not only the field of microbiology, but also hygiene and public health. (Sanna 2003) His original vision of the journal, as the description suggests, was to create a forum with a purpose “beyond original emphasis on communicable disease”. (Sanna 2003) Other past accomplishments of Prof. Sanna in scientific writing was direct the “L’giene Moderna”, a public health journal created in 1908. (Sanna 2003) 
First Issue.
The first issue of the European Journal of Epidemiology appeared in March 1985. The first journal particularly emphasized the epidemiology of infectious diseases, complete with 328 pages of abstracts, academic papers, and study results. (European Journal of Epidemiology 1985) Aside from academic material submitted by other professors and scientists, the journal featured a section to place announcements for upcoming symposia (in the “Back Matter” section usually). (EJE 1985) These symposia, such as “the Second International symposium”, gathered academics throughout Europe to discuss their own ideas and experimental findings. Sanna additionally decided to put an announcements segment where new publications regarding epidemiology, policy, and research written by contributing academics were advertised for purchase for the reader. Prof. Sanna probably intended for the Journal to become a conduit for intellectuals to exchange news and developments. 
Starting in 1986, Prof. Sanna expanded the journal even further to draw feedback from his readers. He created a “letters to the editor” section that included scientific studies either relevant to a previous entry or a specific highlighted topic. Prof. Sanna also introduced a “comments” section and instructions to authors to encourage writing for the journal. The section showed guidelines on how entries should format their abstracts, references, figures, etc. in meticulous detail. A third expansion to the journal was the promotion of miscellaneous relevant classes and workshops, as well as an “erra carriage” section in 1989 to show any corrections a reader has submitted from the previous issue. (EJE 1989)
A possible explanation for these decisions is that they were reflections of Prof. Sanna’s own experiences and personality traits. In other words, the weighted emphasis on open feedback and submissions to the journal parallel his open nature with new academics; he historically organized other symposia of his own and was known to be very welcoming especially to younger intellectuals to gain fresh ideas. These additions perhaps reflect his nature as a professor with “organizational talents”. (Mandra et. al. 1992) 
Editors-in-chief.
Just as Prof. Sanna demonstrated during the 6 years he was editor-in-chief, all editors succeeding him made unique impressions on the European Journal of Epidemiology, adding to both the content and structure of the journal. Prof. Sanna’s “era” lasted for 6 years, from 1985 to 1992. During that time he set out to create a “forum” for academics. However, after his death in 1992, Prof. Carlo Chezzi inherited the position of editor-in-chief for 2 years (1992 to 1994). (Chezzi 1992) Chezzi’s era could be considered an extension of Sanna’s, considering that he did not set out to make too many changes to the journal. His main objective was to continue the legacy of the journal and maintain its popularity among academics. He mostly stabilized the growth of the journal; as a pupil of Dr. Sanna himself, Chezzi carried out Sanna’s vision. 
Major changes to the journal came when Professor Claude Hannoun took over for 8 years from 1994 to 2002. During his time as editor-in-chief, Dr. Hannoun set out to change the direction of the journal; he sought articles that applied more to population health and non-communicable diseases. Moreover, he increased the number of publications from 10 to 12 issues a year, one for each month, and extended the distribution of the journal. (Hannoun 1994)
As Prof. Hannoun stepped down from the editor-in-chief position to editor emeritus, Professor Albert Hofman agreed to take over in 2002. He is a professor of Epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health and the chairman of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. 
Prof. Claude is the current editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Epidemiology. (Sanna 2003) He decided to include more than just disease-related studies into the journal: he emphasized methodology and encouraged submissions on statistical analyses, experiment designs, and others of the sort. Another development during his time was the creation of joint division editing for the journal; the editing staff would concentrate their efforts on their subject of expertise. These editors were physicians that would concentrate in cancer, statistics, bacteriology, genetics, cardiology, respiratory, methodological, tropical disease, infectious disease, or virology. (Hofman 2003)
Content.
Overall, the European Journal of Epidemiology’s content shifted from a biomedical focus in the 1900s to lifestyle focus in the 2000s. According to Nancy Krieger, professor of social epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, the definition of “biomedical” rapidly shifted definitions throughout the 1900s and 2000s in the scientific community and around the world. In general, biomedical theory focused on “applied” research, or research used to diagnose and treat hospital patients. (Krieger 2011) The United Kingdom’s Institute for Biomedical Science, founded in 1912, made clear distinctions between “applied” research for biomedical use, and “basic” research, claimed to be used for only the development of knowledge. (Krieger 2011) For example, the IBMS published the British Journal of Biomedical Sciences that focused on only “applied” research, featuring clinical trials as the main pith of the journal.
The international scientific community did not always concur with this normative definition; the European Journal of Epidemiology was no exception. The United States, when first creating the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 1930, combined “basic” and “applied” research as equal components that made up biomedical research. The European Journal of Epidemiology, despite its name, did not follow the traditional UK definition. This could be due to the fact that the journal, although was meant to represent the scientific community around Europe, was written and influenced by the scientific community in Italy, where the journal is published. Prof. Antonio Sanna, the founding editor, commented on the definition of biomedical and how the traditional meaning did not align with his vision. He stated, “it is not possible to make a distinction between basic and clinical research, in that both are equally important”. (Mandras, et. al. 1992) 
While it was true that the journal reflected Sanna’s intentions on including “applied” and “basic” research, nuances in the subject matter included in the journal’s first issues and later issues drastically changed. Specifically in the 1980s, the majority of the journals content followed a reductionist model of biomedical research; at the time, scientists followed this generalist approach to research because they believed in understanding disease at a microscopic level (especially when observing organs) to apply findings to many different cases. (Krieger 2011) For example, one article in the 1985 issue, “Prevalence of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria and Comparison between Different Screening Methods for its Detection in Infants”, relied on urine samples of 441 children between the ages of 3 to 36 months to detect urinary tract infections. (Goossens 1985) Other studies in the 1985 issue focused on using cultures and vector borne studies, attesting to the fact that the journal at its inception geared towards readers with a scientific background. 
Entering the 1990s and throughout the 2000s the journal shifted to a multifactorial approach to biomedical research, namely by including studies that researched how culture, countries, and lifestyles affected population health. During the 90s the scientific community considered biomedical research to have more of a focus on chemistry and biochemical processes. However, during this time Prof. Hannoun as editor-in-chief of the journal, decided to follow a lifestyle and biomedical approach, similar to Kreiger’s “web of causation” theory. (Kreiger 2011) This approach took into account risk factors of disease, social behavior, and how they interacted with disease. For example, one article in the 1995 issue titled “HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-I/II and STD among female prostitutes in Buenos Aires, Argentina” explored how much at risk prostitutes from different socioeconomic backgrounds were to sexually transmitted diseases, and whether or not these diseases were risk factors of other diseases. (Zapiola 1996) Consequentially, the consideration of risk factors and more diversified studies (coming from Argentina, Paris, Spain, etc) signified Prof. Hannoun’s success in shifting the journal’s focus to non-communicable diseases and to the international scientific community. 
Impact.
The European Journal of Epidemiology was ranked 1009th of the most impactful journals worldwide in 2012. (SCImago 2007) In the category of Journals in Public, Environmental, and Occupational Health, the journal ranked 8th of 157. (SCImago 2007) To compare its impact worldwide, the journal was measured with the SJR indicator. As defined by the Thomson Reuters site, 
“The SJR indicator measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is. Cites per Doc. (2y) measures the scientific impact of an average article published in the journal, it is computed using the same formula that journal impact factor ™”
-SCImago Online
The journal’s SJR in 2012 was 1.946, a drastic increase to its SJR since 1999 Figure 1. Aside from its ranking, the increasing participation in the journal attests to its growing influence in the scientific community. In 2012 the journal measured to contain 38.02 percent of articles that involved the collaboration of international writers and scientists Figure 2. (SCImago 2007) In terms of publications, the top five countries that have cited the journal are Italy, the Netherlands, the United States, Spain, and France, illustrating the journals widening distribution. 
Over time, the journal’s trends in publication reveal two notable characteristics Figure 3. First, the journal, although each year grew in numbers of publications and content, did not publish any issues in 2002. (Thomas Reuters 2013) This gap may be due to the changes in leadership, from Professor Hannoun to Professor Hofman, during that year. Second, the journal’s publications in 2006 more than tripled compared to all other years before and after, from around 200 to 650 published items. (Thomas Reuters 2013) This may be a result of the European Congress of Epidemiology 2006’s the Board of the European Epidemiology Federation of the International Epidemiological Federation of the International Epidemiological Association’s (IEA-EEF) Congress, an international meeting to exchange ideas at Utrecht University through keynote sessions and meetings. (Geert et. al. 2006) The surge in scientists in the Netherlands encouraged numerous abstract submissions and peer review evaluations to publish. (Geert et. al. 2006) Aside from those two anomalies, the journal has had a leveled number of publications, averaging at 200 per issue. Despite that, the number of citations has grown exponentially Figure 3.

High school career.
Griner attended Nimitz High School in Houston. In addition to lettering in basketball throughout high school, she played varsity volleyball as a freshman.
During her senior year, Griner led the Cougars to the Texas 5A girls basketball state championship game, where Nimitz lost 52–43 to Mansfield Summit High School. Griner dunked 52 times in 32 games as a senior, setting a single-game record of seven dunks against Aldine High School. The mayor of Houston Bill White declared May 7, 2009, Brittney Griner Day. On 11 November 2008, she recorded 25 blocks in a game against Houston Alief Hastings, the most ever recorded by a female in a high school game in the US. In her 2008–09 season, she recorded 318 blocks, a single season record.
Griner was named a WBCA All-American and participated in the 2009 WBCA High School All-America Game, leading the team by scoring 20 points and collecting 9 rebounds.
College career.
Griner played college basketball at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. As a freshman, Griner's 223 blocked shots set the all time single-season record, establishing her as one of the greatest shot blockers in women's basketball history. On December 16, 2009, Griner recorded Baylor's first triple-double with 34 points, 13 rebounds, and Big 12 Conference record 11 blocked shots. She became the seventh player to dunk during a women's college basketball game, and only the second woman to dunk twice in a single college game on January 2, 2010, making the second and third dunks of her college career in a lopsided 99–18 victory against Texas State University.
On March 3, 2010, Griner and Texas Tech Jordan Barncastle were battling for position near the lane. As a foul was being called on Barncastle, Griner took two steps forward and threw a right handed roundhouse punch which broke Barncastle's nose. Griner was then ejected from the game. Lady Bears coach Kim Mulkey then imposed another one-game suspension in addition to the one-game suspension mandated by NCAA rules.
Baylor entered the NCAA Tournament as a 4th seed, and knocked off top-seeded Tennessee in the Sweet 16. On March 22, Griner set an NCAA tournament record with 14 blocked shots in a 49–33 win against the Georgetown Hoyas. In the Elite Eight, Baylor defeated Duke 51–48, and Griner blocked 9 shots, totaling 35 for the tournament, a new NCAA Women's Tournament record. Duke's Alison Bales had held the previous record of 30 blocks in the 2006 NCAA Women's Tournament. Baylor reached the Final Four, before losing to eventual-champion UConn, 70–50. Griner was named an AP Second Team All-American.
As a sophomore, Griner received First Team All-American honors after averaging 23 points a game, including a career-high 40 points against Green Bay in the Sweet 16.
In her junior season, Griner averaged 23.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 5 blocks per game. She blocked more shots than any other Division I women's "team" that season. Griner was named AP Player of the Year and The 2012 Premier Player of Women's College Basketball.
On April 3, 2012, Griner led Baylor with 26 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocked shots to win the Division I Women's Basketball Championship, 80–61 over Notre Dame. Griner was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. Baylor finished its undefeated season with 40 wins, the most in NCAA history.
After winning the championship on 3 April 2012, Griner decided to withdraw her candidacy for a roster spot on the 2012 U.S. Olympic women's basketball team. A month later Griner broke her wrist after jumping off her skateboard when she was going down a ramp.
Professional career.
Phoenix Mercury.
The only international players surpassing her are the late Margo Dydek, at 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m), the late Sue Geh, at 2.05 metres (6 ft 9 in) tall, Heidi Gillingham at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) and Allyssa DeHaan. In the 2013 WNBA Draft, the Phoenix Mercury selected Griner as the 1st overall pick. In her debut game on May 27, 2013 against Chicago Sky Brittney equaled the WNBA dunk record, recording two dunks to equal Candace Parker's career total. She thus became the third WNBA player to dunk and first to do it twice in one game.
USA Basketball.

The Eternal Kansas City

"The Eternal Kansas City" is a song by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was the key song on the 1977 album "A Period of Transition", and was his first single released since "Gloria" in 1974.
Biographer Howard DeWitt believes that the song makes the listener feel as if in a church, because of the "mystical choir", featured at the beginning of the song: "Excuse me do you know the way to Kansas City?". "Then an almost jump arrangement makes 'The Eternal Kansas City' an excellent rhythm and blues influenced song."
Johnny Rogan describes the song as "The only song on the album where there was evidence of Morrison's mysterious majesty, it blended the lily-white sound of Anita Kerr Singers with strong gospel overtones."
Dr John on the song.
Dr John, arranger and musician on "A Period of Transition", describes the song as being:
The song that Van got the whole album hooked up around. It was a real deep thing for him to focus on. It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then into a kind of chunky R&B.

Bayoumi Andil

Bayoumi Andil () (31 July 1942 to 8 October 2009) was an Egyptian linguist, thinker and writer who authored many books on Egyptian culture and Modern Egyptian language.
He is one of the most renowned researchers and linguists on the topic of modern Egyptian language.
In his most important book, "The present State of Culture in Egypt", Andil points out that Egyptians have attempted to change their national identity and language as well as their national religion since embracing Christianity in the 1st century AD and again after the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 AD. Andil claims that Egyptians have Egyptianized both Christianity and Islam and argues that the true Egyptian spirit survived only in the oral culture of the illiterate Egyptians, whose illiteracy has protected them and their national identity from annihilation. Andil also published many articles and books, in which he proposed that Modern Masri Egyptian language is nothing but the fourth stage of the languages of the Egyptians, and should not truly be considered a variety of Arabic, but rather a linguistic evolution of the Coptic language and the Ancient Egyptian language. The grammatical, morphological and phonological differences between the spoken Egyptian language and the Arabic language is sufficiently disparate to categorize them into two distinct groups, and the similarities between the first and its Egyptian ancestors, both Coptic and ancient Egyptian, are strong enough to consider the modern Masri Egyptian language an evolution of Ancient Egyptian.
Since the 1980s, Andil's work focused on promoting the revival of Egyptian nationalism. Despite Andil's great admiration for Taha Hussein, an intellectual pillars of the Egyptian enlightenment movement in the first half of the 20th century, Andil criticised Hussein’s publication, "Mustaqbal al-Thaqafa fi Misr" or "(The Future of Culture in Egypt)", as Andil perceived it fell short of adequately defining Egyptian culture.
Celebration of plurality.
Andil argued that the culture of a nation is the sum total of the value systems created by its people over the entire course of the nation's history. He believed that Egyptian culture is the outcome of an agriculture-based civilisation and that Egyptian forefathers were the first to establish the solar calendar, the bases of medicine and geometry. In his books delineating the achievements of the Egyptians, Andil quoted James H. Breasted to support his hypothesis that the ancient Egyptians were the first to create a system of writing, in addition to referring to the arguments of linguistics scholar Simon Potter over the leading role of the Egyptian alphabet.
Andil focused on plurality as an important dimension of Egyptian culture. Egyptian myths referred to a host of gods. Followers of different gods used to hold festivals to celebrate them. Yet these festivals were universal; the followers of Osiris celebrated Ra and the other way round while followers of Amon sanctified Isis, and so on. This phenomenon can till today be traced; until today, Cairenes celebrate Mulid al-Sayed al-Badawi of Tanta, while Alexandrians celebrate Mulid Abul-Haggag of Luxor. By the same token, Muslims celebrate the Coptic Mulids such as those held to commemorate the Holy Virgin or St Barsoum al-Erian. Such manifestations of plurality promote the value of recognising and accepting the other. There was no room for such value under Akhnaton, who, by calling for the exclusive worship of one god (Aton), became the founder of the culture of takfir (considering those different in religion as infidels) currently prevailing in most Arab and Muslim societies. Yet Akhnaton is commonly revered as the father of monotheism.
A gentle people.
Among the cultural norms stressed in Andil’s writing was the respect of women. Unlike the region’s other peoples, Egyptians were distinguished by the appreciation of women. The attributes of Sayeda Zeinab, the granddaughter of the Prophet Mohamed—had their source in those of Isis. The same could be said about her brother al-Hussein whose attributes had much in common with those of Osiris.
Although Egyptian culture changed in many ways over the ages, certain features survived. The first is tolerance, a characteristic of agriculture-based societies, and the second is plurality which led Herodotus to describe ancient Egyptians as the most pious people. Centuries later, Sigmund Freud conceived of Egyptians as a gentle people, while he considered Semites wild and savage. Plurality in turn led to the promotion of equality between men and women. Yet there was a setback in terms of the status of women with the advent of the Romans and later the Arabs.
Andil has a telling story to confirm his view of the inherent gentleness of Egyptians. He heard the story from a Palestinian friend who was living in Gaza during the Israeli invasion in 1956. When Jewish soldiers of Egyptian origin inspected her home, they caused no harm to the family, on the contrary quelling the family’s fears. One of the soldiers gently told her grandmother: “Don’t be afraid, mother, and don’t bother to get up. Stay where you are”. Iraqi Jew soldiers, by contrast, stormed her neighbours’ house and wreaked havoc in their home and committed horrible crimes.
Out of the dark tunnel.
Egyptian culture had an impact on Quran tajweed (the way of chanting Quranic verses). Sheikh Mohammed Refaat used the oriental Nahawand scale in the tajweed while Sheikh Mustafa Ismail used the Bayaty scale.
Andil was a staunch defender of illiterate Egyptians for the role they played in preserving and transmitting Egyptian culture from one generation to the next. Educated people connived with the Anglo-Americans to Arabise Egypt. Reactionary ideas and values were accordingly promoted and this climate bred millions of terrorists who antagonise those who believe in other religions.
Andil concluded that the only way out of this dark tunnel is to revive the Egyptian nationality. Iranians, for instance, accepted Islam, but never accepted Arabism. They are proud of their pre-Islamic heroes, myths and gods. The same could be said about Finnish people who liberated themselves from the Swedish culture thanks to their intellectuals who spared no effort to revive the national heritage of the country. Indians preserved their culture in the face of the Mongols, while the great Spanish people under Queen Isabella liberated their country from the Arab invaders.
Are we Egyptian?
In sum, Andil’s cultural project revolved around one question: are we Egyptians at the core? Semites—Arabs and Hebrews alike—led tribal pastoral lives based upon violence and seizing others’ lands, whereas the values of tolerance, cooperation and love characterising Egyptian culture has much to do with the agricultural society of our forefathers. Such conflict between the two cultures is very well expressed in the title of Andil’s opus magnum Hadher al-Thaqafa fi Misr (The Present of Culture in Egypt). In the book, Andil posed the decisive question: who is going ultimately to win, the farmers or the herdsmen?
Unlike Taha Hussein and Salama Moussa, who opposed the Arabisation of Egypt but set their sights on the Mediterranean, Andil believes that the Egyptian civilisation is African in the first place. Egyptians are Hamites who interacted with a host of peoples and civilisations, but remained Egyptian. Therefore, Egyptians should assert themselves as Africans against Arab identity which, he insists, has for over 14 centuries worked to corrupt the Egyptian identity. Peoples of the region—Egyptians, Berbers, Nubians, Bejas, Kurds and even Yemenis and Hijazis—have no way to preserve their authentic identity but to liberate themselves from Arabism. The outcome would be a more elegant and sophisticated culture that respects all identities.
Andil was a great man. Yet his project was opposed by many intellectuals even though not a single study was conducted to refute his premises.

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Patna

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Patna () is an archdiocese located in the city of Patna in India.
History.
History Of The Archdiocese of Patna.
The Congregation for the Propagation of Faith erected the Prefecture of Tibet - Hindustan in 1703 and entrusted it to the Capuchin Fathers of the Italian Province of Picenum in the Marches of Ancona. The first group of fathers reached Lhasa (Tibet) in 1707 and began Church work there. For nearly 41 years the Capuchin Fathers worked in Lhasa until a religious persecution forced them to give up their mission and move to Kathmandu (Nepal) in 1745.
Nepal had seen the Capuchin Fathers working with varying success in Kathmandu since 1715. A new conqueror of Kathmandu valley, Raja Pritvi Narayan, who was not sympathetic to the Fathers stopped all support to them. The Mission of Nepal was also abandoned in 1769, and the Fathers with 62 Nepalese Christians and five catechumens moved to India. The Nepalese Christians and catechumens settled down at Chuhari near Bettiah. The scene of the capuchin Mission shifted now to the Indian soil. Fr Joseph Mary ofm cap, a saintly priest, founded the Bettiah Mission in 1745 after the King of Bettiah, Raja Druva Singh had obtained permission from Pope Benedict XIV.
Rome erected the Prefecture of Tibet-Hindustan into a Vicariate in 1812. In 1827 an Independent Patna Vicariate was created, comprising Bettiah, Chuhari, Patna City, Dinapore, Bhagalpur, Darjeeling, Sikkim, Nepal, and adjacent territories. The saintly Anastasius Hartmann, ofm cap., was appointed its first Vicar Apostolic. With a Decree of Pope Leo XIII Patna Vicariate became a part of Allahabad diocese in 1886. The North Bihar Mission with its four stations of Bettiah, Chuhari, Chakhani and Latonah was entrusted to the Tyrolese Capuchins in 1886. In May 1892 the North Bihar Mission was made Bettiah - Nepal Prefecture with Fr Hilarion of Abtei, ofm cap, as its first Prefect. In 1919 this Prefecture was dissolved and joined to South Bihar to form the present Diocese of Patna.
Pope Benedict XV by a Decree on September 10, 1919 divided the Diocese of Allahabad into two. The Diocese of Patna was thus created. The Prefecture of Bettiah-Nepal was annexed to the new diocese. The Holy See entrusted Patna diocese to American Missouri Province of the Society of Jesus. Later, on November 13, 1930, after the division of Missouri Province, Patna diocese was entrusted to the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus. Louis Van Hoeck, S.J. was ordained the first Bishop of Patna on March 6, 1921.
The Third Order Regular (T.O.R.) Franciscan Fathers from Pennsylvania, USA came to Patna diocese to assist the Jesuits in 1938. The mission stations of Bhagalpur, Gokhla, Poreyahat and Godda were assigned to them. In 1956 Bhagalpur was made a Prefecture and in 1965 it was created a Diocese with Msgr Urban Mc Garry, T.O.R., as its First Bishop.
The forbidden Kingdom of Nepal was once again open for Fathers in 1951, thanks to the efforts of Fr. Marshall D. Moran, S.J. Nepal was made an independent ecclesiastical unit in 1984 and Fr. Antony Sharma, S.J. was appointed as its First Mission Superior.
On March 28, 1980, Pope John Paul II, accepted the resignation of Bishop Augustine Wildermuth S.J., and divided the Patna diocese into two units: Patna and Muzzaffarpur. Fr Benedict J Osta S.J., was appointed Bishop of Patna.
The Diocese of Patna comprises in the State of Bihar, the Districts of Patna, Nalanda, Nawadah, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas, Jehanabad, Bhojpur, Bhabhua, Buxar and part of Munger.

Life.
At the age of seventeen he entered the Society of Jesus (4 Oct, 1657). Till the year 1674, when he pronounced his final vows, his services were in various capacities, particularly teaching. From this date his abilities directed towards preaching and evangelism.
Works.
Toward the latter end of his life he gave himself up almost exclusively to literary activity. The following is a list of his works: 
To the above, almost all the biographies add another work, of which the full title is "L'Imitation de Jesus-Christ, Traduction nouvelle: Avec une Pratique et une Piére à la fin de chaque Chapitre" (Par. le R. P. de Gonnelieu, de la Compagnie de Jésus, Paris and Nancy, 1712); but a great majority of the bibliographies too, of somewhat arbitrarily, deny that Traduction (translation), as distinct from the secours (helps) at the end of each chapter, is by de Gonnelieu. The opinion of the negative critics seems to be based mainly on the statement of Calmet (op. cit. below), that "the translation is by John-Baptiste Cusson at Nancy, and the rest by P. Gonnelieu". The "Journal des Sçavans" on the other hand, in a review written within one year after the publication of the work, whilst praising the zeal and piety of the translator, says expressly that the version is by P. Gonnelieu; and adds that "Sieur Cusson (one time printer of the Journal) has enriched this first edition by many copper-plates".

John Barsad

John Barsad is a character in Charles Dickens' novel, "A Tale of Two Cities".
Overview.
Barsad is a turncoat, English con-man, and spy and partner of Roger Cly. In the pay of the Marquis St. Evremonde, he initially frames the Marquis' nephew, Charles Darnay by planting evidence on him on a voyage across the English Channel to England. Roger Cly, also revealed to be a spy, fakes his death and flees England, but Jerry Cruncher discovers the fraud when he attempts to 'resurrect' Cly's body for the purpose of finding valuables. Cruncher initially blames his wife's praying and thinks Roger Cly has been removed through spiritual means. When Carton discovers Barsad in Paris much later (and revealed to be Miss Pross' long-lost brother Solomon), he enlists Barsad's aid by blackmailing him to get into the prison to rescue Charles Darnay by changing places with him leading to Carton's eventual execution by guillotine. Barsad then brings Darnay out of the prison and back to his family. He is genuinely dumbfounded by Carton’s sacrifice - though not enough to change his own ways. In the final prophetic chapter, Barsad, along with many others, is revealed to die by the guillotine sometime in the future.
Analysis.
Barsad is described in Book 2, Chapter 3 of "A Tale of Two Cities" as "one of the greatest scoundrels upon the earth since accursed Judas-which he certainly did look rather like." This is a direct reference to Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed Jesus Christ in the Bible, and is explaining that Barsad is a very untrustworthy man.

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore is an archdiocese located in the cities of Pondicherry and Cuddalore in India. The Archdiocese now celebrates its 125 years of being elevated to the status of Archdiocese.
History.
With a land area of 11,348 square kilometers, the Archdiocese of Pondicherry-Cuddalore extends over the Pondicherry and Karaikal civil districts of Puducherry union territory and the civil districts of Cuddalore and Viluppuram of Tamil Nadu state. In 2001, the total population of the area was 6,151,891. Ethnic groups in the territory include the Tamils and French.
The Mission of The Jesuits And The Capuchins.
The great ancestor of this Archdiocese is the Carnatic Mission, which was started around the year 1700 as Mission sui iuris. This Carnatic Mission was known as Missions of the Coromandel Coast and also as the Malabar Mission.
Before the establishment of the Carnatic Mission in 1700, the Jesuit Fathers of the Madurai Mission, especially John de Britto, entered the Gingee kingdom after 1660, and preached the Gospel up to the Palar River, south of Madras. Members of various religious orders, looked after the spiritual needs of the European communities in their trading centres along the coastal areas, including Cuddalore and Porto Novo. The French Capuchins first settled in Pondicherry in 1674 and the French Jesuits, expelled from Siam also took refuge in Pondicherry in 1688. But, in 1693, the Dutch chased away all the religious groups from Pondicherry, and they were only able to return in 1699. While the Capuchins were looking after the Europeans in Pondicherry, the French Jesuits organized the Carnatic Mission for the Indian people.
The Boundaries Of the Carnatic Mission.
The boundaries of the Carnatic mission were as follows:
Jesuits Replaced By Foreign Mission Fathers.
The continual wars in the 18th century, the ruin of Pondicherry town in 1761 and the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, badly hit the vast Carnatic Mission.
In 1776, the French Jesuit fathers were replaced at the order of Rome by the foreign Mission French Fathers. Although the Bishop of these new missionaries had all the power of jurisdiction, he was not given the title “Vicar Apostolic”, but instead called the “Superior of the Mission of the Coromandel Coast.” Rome successively gave him the jurisdiction over the Madurai, Coimbatore and Mysore areas, affected by the suppression of the Society of Jesus. By 1800, the extent of the Carnatic Mission was immense, but the labourers were very few.
The First Vicar Apostolic And The First Archbishop.
The Carnatic Mission was reorganized when new apostolic vicariates were created: Madras in 1832, Madurai in 1836, and the vicariates of Visakhapatnam, Mysore and Coimbatore in 1845.
Pondicherry became an apostolic vicariate of the Coromandel coast, on 1 September 1836, with Mgr. Bonnand as its first vicar apostolic. This apostolic vicariate was raised to an archbishopric on 1 September 1886, with Mgr. Laouenan as the first archbishop.
Subsequently, subdivisions of the archdiocese took place, creating the new dioceses of Kumbakonam in 1899 and Salem in 1930. In 1928 a great part of the present diocese of Vellore was separated from Pondicherry and attached to the archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore. On a reorganisation of the archdiocese by Rome in 1969, the Madurantagam taluk of Kanchipuram district was transferred to Madras, and Tiruvannamalai taluk to Vellore .
The Final Formation.
As the archdiocese of Pondicherry extended over the Pondicherry union territory and the South Arcot district of Madras State, on 7 August 1953 it was given a new title by Rome: the "Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore".
Originally, the archdiocese included the former French settlements of Pondicherry, Karaikal, Chandannagar, Mahe, and Yanam. Another ex-French settlement was also looked after by the MSFS Fathers in Visakhapatnam. Chandannagar was re-allocated to the archdiocese of Calcutta, now Kolkata, and Mahé to the Kerala diocese of Calicut, now Kozhikode, in 1949.
The present archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore extends over the Pondicherry and Karaikal districts of Puducherry and the Cuddalore (excluding Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil taluks) and Viluppuram districts of Tamil Nadu.

USS Independence (1776 sloop)

USS "Independence" (1776 sloop) was a sloop in the Continental Navy. Acting as a dispatch boat, she was sent to France on a diplomatic mission – carrying important dispatches. While there, John Paul Jones embarked on her, and she received additional salutes to the American Republic from the French.
Continental Navy service.
"Independence" was a Continental sloop built in Baltimore, Maryland, and purchased and fitted out by the Marine Committee. 
In September 1776 she cruised under Captain John Young along the Atlantic Ocean coast to the Caribbean Sea to guard American merchant trade in the West Indies. 
In mid-1777 she sailed for France, arriving at Lorient in late September with important diplomatic dispatches. She captured two prizes en route and disposed of these in France before the Royal Navy could interfere. 
She was in Quiberon Bay 14 February 1778 when John Paul Jones in "Ranger" received the first national salute to the flag—the first official recognition of the American Republic by a foreign power. The following morning, Jones embarked in "Independence" and again exchanged salutes. 
Wrecked on the bar.
"Independence" soon sailed for the United States. She was wrecked on the bar 24 April 1778 while attempting to enter Okracoke Inlet, North Carolina.

Compact stencil

In mathematics, especially in the areas of numerical analysis called numerical partial differential equations, a compact stencil is a type of stencil that uses only nine nodes for its discretization method in two dimensions. It uses only the center node and the adjacent nodes. For any structured grid utilizing a compact stencil in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions the maximum number of nodes is 3, 9, or 27 respectively. Compact stencils may be compared to non-compact stencils. Compact stencils are currently implemented in many partial differential equation solvers, including several in the topics of CFD, FEA, and other mathematical solvers relating to PDE's.
Two Point Stencil Example.
The two point stencil for the "first derivative" of a function is given by:
formula_1.
This is obtained from the Taylor series expansion of the first derivative of the function given by:
formula_2.
Replacing formula_3 with formula_4, we have:
formula_5.
Addition of the above two equations together results in the cancellation of the terms in odd powers of formula_3:
formula_7.
formula_8.

Three Point Stencil Example.
For example, the three point stencil for the "second derivative" of a function is given by:
formula_10.
This is obtained from the Taylor series expansion of the first derivative of the function given by:
formula_2.
Replacing formula_3 with formula_4, we have:

Margaret Calkin James

Margaret Calkin James (June 1895 - 1985), was a calligrapher, graphic designer, textile printer, watercolour painter and printmaker, and is best known for her posters designed for the London Underground and London Transport between 1928 and 1935. Untold numbers of commuters admired her Kenwood and Boxhill posters while oblivious of her identity.
She was born in Emmanuel, West Hampstead, the third of seven children of Harry Bernard Calkin (1861–1926), a senior underwriter at Lloyds and Margaret Agnes Palfrey (1870–1936), daughter of Penry Powell Palfrey (1830–1902), a well-known artist in stone and stained glass.
She attended North London Collegiate School from 1909 to 1913. She was a student at the Central School of Arts and Crafts between 1913 and 1915, specialising in calligraphy and winning the Queen's Scholarship in her final year. She then enrolled at the Westminster School of Art. Her work was displayed at "The Rainbow Workshops" in Great Russell Street in Bloomsbury, which she opened in 1920 after World War I and was one of the first galleries started by a woman to promote art, craft and design. She lived and worked at Lapstone Farm, in Chipping Campden during World War II.
She designed posters for London Transport, book jackets for Jonathan Cape, pattern papers for Curwen Press, programmes and booklets for the BBC and a greetings telegram for the GPO. Some of her textiles were used at the new Norwich City Hall in 1938.
In the late 1960s she suffered a stroke, paralysing her right side and depriving her of speech. Undaunted, she started a series of wool embroidery designs using her left hand.
In June 1922 she married Charles Holloway James, a distinguished architect who trained under Sir Edwin Lutyens. After her marriage she worked from a studio at her home 'Hornbeams'. Her daughter, Elizabeth Argent, lives at Alcester.

Helogale

Helogale is a genus of two species of mongooses, namely the Common Dwarf Mongoose and Ethiopian Dwarf Mongoose. They are the smallest species of mongoose and both are endemic to Africa. The distribution of the latter species is more tropical, and overlaps completely with that of the Common Dwarf Mongoose which is more widespread. Both are social diurnal species, and due to their small sizes they are vulnerable to predation. Both species live independently of open water.

Richard John Berardino (born July 2, 1937, at Cambridge, Massachusetts) is a player development consultant for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. A former outfielder and longtime manager in minor league baseball, he also spent three years (1989–91) as a coach with the Red Sox. As a player, Berardino batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed .
A three-sport star at Watertown, Massachusetts, High School, Berardino graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 1959 after leading the Crusaders to the 1958 NCAA District One baseball championship. He signed with the New York Yankees upon graduation and batted .378 in his first professional season, with the Modesto Reds of the Class C California League. He reached Triple-A for three seasons (1962–64), playing for the Richmond Virginians, Indianapolis Indians and Spokane Indians, but never broke through to the Major League level. All told, Berardino appeared in 812 minor league games, and batted .272 with 702 hits and 70 home runs.
Berardino compiled a record of 753 wins and 858 losses (.467) with two championships in 21 seasons (1966–67; 1971–85; 1987–88; 1997–98) as a minor league manager. Nineteen of those 21 seasons were spent in short-season leagues. Berardino managed two full-season Class A clubs, the Greensboro Hornets of the South Atlantic League in 1987, and the Lynchburg Red Sox of the Carolina League the following season.
His managing career began in the Yankee organization, where he handled Rookie-level clubs in the Gulf Coast and Appalachian leagues. In 1968, Berardino joined the Red Sox organization as a minor league coach, and marks his 47th consecutive year with Boston. From 1971 through 1985, he spent 15 consecutive seasons as the manager of the Red Sox' Short Season Class A New York-Penn League farm clubs, the Williamsport Red Sox and the Elmira Pioneers (also known as the "Red Sox" and "Suns" during his 13-year tenure there). Berardino returned to the NY-PL a dozen years later, in 1997–98, as manager of the Lowell Spinners. In addition to his minor league managerial and coaching assignments, and his three years as bullpen and third-base coach on the Major League staff of Joe Morgan in Boston, he also has served the Red Sox as field coordinator and assistant field coordinator of minor league instruction and roving outfield and baserunning coach.

Conquest of Southern Tang by Song

In 975 AD the Song managed through force to subdue the state now known as Southern Tang, to distinguish it from the synonymously named Tang Dynasty, as part of a series of Song conquests to reunify China.
Battle on the Yangtze.
On the river Yangtze near Nanking, the then capital of the Southern Tang, a major naval battle took place in 975 between the Song empire and the Southern Tang.
Southern Tang.
The Tang had a fleet of ships that were ten decks high and equipped with multiple flamethrowers. There were at least 150,000 soldiers and sailors under the command of Chu Ling Pin.
Song empire.
The admiral for the Song was Tshao Pin, The Song ships were smaller however the crew on board were better archers. The ships had flamethrowers and were filled with bundles of reed soaked in oil to be thrown at the enemy ships.
Battle.
The Song ships attacked ferociously, firing so many arrows that soon, the Tang ships were studded with them. Chu Ling Pin then ordered the flamethrowers to be fired. Normally, any attacker would be destroyed, however the wind blew in the opposite direction of the flamethrowers so the burning oil flew back onto the Tang. At that moment, the Song started throwing the bundles of burning reeds into the wind to cause more damage. The Song may have started using their own flamethrowers at this stage. About 150,000 Tang soldiers and sailors were killed in the fire and Chu Ling Pin committed suicide by jumping into the flames.
Analysis of Battle.
Considering the position of Nanking in China, where the imperial capital would have been, and the above "evidence". It can be assumed that there was a strong westerly wind on the day of that battle. The attackers would have had the advantage of having a good wind behind them, their ships would have travelled much faster, and their arrows, "burning bundles" and burning oil would have had extra propulsion. However, the defending side would have had the exact opposite to this. Considering the claimed size of the defenders ships, Chu Ling Pin would have probably been inside the ship and may have not been aware of what the weather was like, which would have led him to make the mistake of ordering the flamethrowers to be fired. On a technological note, we know that the Wujing Zongyao written in 1044 (although the oldest edition is from around the 1560s) describes the flamethrowers oil being lit by fire drug (a flammable, quasi explosive compound that would in later cultures and generations be refined into gunpowder) and we know that fire drug was invented as a medicine sometime in the 9th century, but whether this battle did use gunpowder is speculative.
Aftermath.
Li Houzhu the emperor of the Southern Tang was more interested in poetry than ruling and soon after this battle the Southern Tang were absorbed into the new Song Empire. He was captured and sent to the Song capital, one of his wives raped and he was eventually poisoned.

8 cm FK M. 5

The 8 cm Feldkanone M 05 was a field gun used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. Guns captured by Italy were used as the Cannone da 77/28 modello 5. It was a conventional design, with its most notable feature being its obsolescent autofrettaged bronze (so-called steel-bronze) barrel, necessary because Austria-Hungary still had trouble making steel of the proper quality. Its development was quite prolonged as the Austrians took years to decide on the proper recoil system and type of breech. Even then production difficulties prevented its introduction into service until 1907.
The M 05 was adapted for use in narrow mountain paths as the M 05/08 and could be disassembled into 3 loads. The base of the barrel was given lifting grips to speed its removal from the carriage and the carriage itself was modified to allow it to be disassembled. The original version seems to generally have left service after the war, with only Italy retaining a few in service. Some of these were captured by Nazi Germany and pressed into service as the 7.65 cm FK(i). The M 05/08 was widely used by the Austro-Hungarian successor states after World War I and captured weapons were retained in service by Italy as the Cannone da 77/28 modello 5/8. Captured weapons were used by Nazi Germany under the designations 7.65 cm FK 5/8(ö) or (t) and 7.65 cm FK 300(j).

Nofit

Nofit (, "lit." Scenic) is a communal settlement in northern Israel. Located in the Lower Galilee, it falls under the jurisdiction of Zevulun Regional Council. In 2007 it had a population of 2,600.
The beginnings of the village were with a group of eight families from Haifa and the Kerayot who were interested in establishing a communal settlement in the Galilee. The initiator of the idea and the organizer of the group was Architect Zvi Springer who planned the village with a sustainable vision. The initiative was co-ordinated with the state, who approved the idea in 1982. Work on the infrastructure began in 1984, whilst the building of homes began in April 1986. The first residents (179 families) moved in on 9 November 1987. The village was initially named Pi Ner after Ludwig Piner, the head of Rassco, though it was later changed to Nofit.

Noel Moore

Noel Ernest Ackroyd Moore (25 November 1928 – 30 May 2008) was a British civil servant who was responsible for running the process leading to the decimalisation of the UK's currency in 1971. He was later principal of the Civil Service College.
Early life.
Born in Yorkshire, on 25 November 1928, Moore was the son of a monumental mason. Schooled at Penistone Grammar School, he went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge on a scholarship to read modern languages, graduating in 1950. During his time at Cambridge he won a half-blue for chess, and developed what would be a lifelong interest in the history and culture of Europe. University was followed by National Service, a period in the ranks was followed by a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Educational Corps.
Civil service.
Moore entered the Post Office in 1952 in the grade of assistant principal. He initially retained an army commission in the Territorial Army, transferring to the Intelligence Corps on 26 November 1952. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1953, acting captain on 1 June 1954 and substantive captain on 25 November 1955. He transferred to the TA reserve of officers on 2 May 1956. He was promoted to the grade of principal in 1957.
Moore began his association with decimalisation in 1961 when he was appointed secretary to the British Committee of Inquiry on Decimal Currency, chaired by John Giffard, 3rd Earl of Halsbury. From 1966 he played the same role for the Decimal Currency Board, chaired by Lord Fiske, effectively giving him day-to-day responsibility for managing the transition to decimal currency. Despite the scale of the project, it encountered few problems, and the changeover was largely free from problems. His 1973 book, "The Decimalisation of Britain’s Currency" is considered the definitive account of the changeover.
With the successful conclusion of decimalisation, Moore transferred to the Civil Service Department in 1972, with the grade of under secretary. He was much concerned with improving management in the civil service, ultimately serving as principal of the Civil Service College in Sunningdale from 1981–86.
Retirement.
Following Moore's retirement in 1986 he continued to be in demand as an advisor to the European Union on how to manage the transition to the Euro. He also advised the Bank of England for an exhibition marking 25 years since the introduction of the decimal currency.
With his wife, Mary, whom he had married in 1954, he was a regular volunteer at an Oxfam shop in Brentwood. Mary died in January 2008. Moore died of a brain tumour on 30 May 2008, leaving two sons, David and Richard.

Harish C. Mehta

Harish Chandra Mehta is a university lecturer and historian of the Foreign Relations of the United States.
Education.
Born in Lucknow, India, Dr. Mehta was educated at La Martiniere College (he was in Hodson House), and the University of Lucknow at Canning College. He was an International Freedom Forum Fellow and graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His Ph.D. dissertation at McMaster University is on North Vietnam's diplomacy during the American war in Vietnam. He argues that the people of North Vietnam conducted remarkably successful diplomacy despite the meager economic and military strength of their country. He has conducted research in the Vietnamese archives, and speaks and writes in Vietnamese ("Tieng Viet").
Journalistic career.
He began his journalistic career in the late-1970s as a reporter on "Bombay" magazine of the India Today Group. In the early-1980s, he was National Affairs Editor/Associate Editor of Gentleman (magazine), a Bombay based features magazine that pursued serious investigative journalism under the helm of editor Minhaz Merchant, and ran stories and columns by the Indian poet Dom Moraes, and others. Later, Mehta worked as Associate Publisher and Managing Editor of the Bombay-based "Imprint" magazine when Moraes was editor, and R.V. Pandit was publisher.
In the late 1980s, he moved to Singapore as Indochina Correspondent for the Business Times, covering Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. He was then posted as Indochina correspondent in Bangkok. After completing his assignment with the Business Times, he wrote country reports on Thailand for "The Economist Intelligence Unit" and articles for "Outlook India".
Harish is married to Julie B. Mehta, a scholar of Post-colonial studies, who teaches at the University of Toronto.
Books.
Mehta has written three books on Cambodia: "Hun Sen: Strongman of Cambodia" (co-author Julie Mehta) is based on several hours of interviews with Prime Minister Hun Sen, whom the authors have known personally for eighteen years. Although this is an authorized biography published in 1999, book reviewers have written that the account is fairly balanced, and provides new perspectives on a leader whose life has been shrouded in secrecy. A new and updated edition of the book containing more than 100 new pages and based on several hours of new interviews with Hun Sen is being launched in 2012.
Mehta's 2001 book "Warrior Prince: Norodom Ranariddh, Son of King Sihanouk of Cambodia" is based on several hours of interviews with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, his wife Princess Marie Ranariddh (interviewed by Julie), his brother Prince Norodom Chakrapong, and Prince Chakrapong's son Prince Norodom Buddhapong, as well as several actors in Cambodian politics. King Norodom Sihanouk was critical of the book, and issued several press statements in order to correct the historical record.
As a New Left Historian, Mehta is supportive of the efforts by King Norodom Sihanouk to create a neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. Mehta praises King Sihanouk's influential role as a leading global voice for national liberation struggles in several decolonizing countries in Asia in his public statements and in signed editorials in Kambuja magazine. Mehta argues that historians will remember King Sihanouk as a nationalist who attempted to keep his country free from the hegemony of both the United States and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Hun Sen, likewise, opposes American intervention in his country.
Mehta's 1997 book "Cambodia Silenced: The Press Under Six Regimes" is the first effort to document the troubled history of the Cambodian press. These three books have been widely cited in historical works and dissertations by scholars, and are on recommended reading lists in history, political science and journalism courses at some universities.
Mehta's articles have appeared in the journals "Peace and Change", and "Diplomatic History" in early 2012. He is working on a new book on North Vietnam's people's diplomacy, and a second edition of his 1999 book, "Hun Sen of Cambodia" (co-author Julie Mehta) is being published in early 2013.
Awards.
As a historian, Mehta has won several academic awards, among which is the Samuel Flagg Bemis Award in 2008 and 2007 given by the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. 
In 1989, he won the Journalist of the Year award from the Press Foundation of Asia, Manila and the Mitsubishi Public Affairs Committee, Japan.

Another Time Another Place

This was Matt Bianco's first album after splitting from Warner Brothers. Eager to take on the world without the constraints of a marketing department, Mark Fisher and Mark Reilly recorded this in the Fishbowl, Fisher's own studio on the outskirts of London. This record saw a new group of session musicians participating in the production, although Robin Jones was still around to record percussive layers that support the songs rhythm structure. Ronnie Ross had died, so the brass section had to be reorganised as well, giving the record a different timbre. To be sold, the record needed distributors, which were found for Germany, France, Spain, Latin America and Asia, but only JVC-Victor in Japan really made some headway in promoting them to the local audience, and the album went Gold there. Due to lack of airplay it failed to have any major impact in the rest of the world. This was not due to particularly bad material, as songs like "You and I" and "Head over Heels" are some of the best Fisher wrote. Nevertheless the lack of backing of a major label was certainly showing.

Kfar Hasidim (, "lit." Village of Hasidim), also known as Kfar Hasidim Alef to distinguish it from Kfar Hasidim Bet, is a moshav in northern Israel. Located near Kiryat Ata, it falls under the jurisdiction of Zevulun Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 572.
The village was founded in 1924 by a group of Hasidic immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah who had been preparing in Poland. Although the Hasidic town of Bnei Brak had already been established, this time the aim was to create an agricultural settlement rather than an urban one. 
Shlomo Goren, future head of the Military Rabbinate of the Israel Defense Forces and subsequently Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1973 to 1983, was raised in Kfar Hasidim, which his father co-founded.
In 1950 Kfar Hasidim Bet was established nearby by non-agricultural residents of Kfar Hasidim. Today the village is largely national-religious and secular. The Kfar HaNoar HaDati youth village lies adjacent to the moshav.

Village development committee

A village development committee (VDC) () in Nepal is the lower administrative part of its local development ministry. Each district has several VDCs, similar to municipalities but with greater public-government interaction and administration. There are 3,915 village development committees in Nepal. A VDC is further divided into wards (); the number depends on the population of the district: the average is nine wards.
Purpose.
The purpose of village development committees is to organize village people structurally at a local level and to create a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralized institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development and ensures proper use and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees in a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income, and will monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.
Organization.
In VDCs, there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is a chief that is elected. With these, there are four members elected or nominated.
To keep data, records and to manage administrative works, there is one village secretary. The position is appointed by the government permanently, from whom they receive a salary. The ward members, ward chief, and VDC chiefs are not paid a salary, but they obtain money according to presence. Indragufa community development foundation is working for the community support programme with the support of ICIMOD, UNDP/SGP, Empower Nepal Foundation (US), and Michigan State University (US) since 1999.
VDC is guided from the district development committee, headquarters, and the chief of DDC is a local development officer (LDO).

Muhammad bin Jamil Zeno

Sheikh Muhammad bin Jamil Zeno (1925 – October 8, 2010) was a highly respected yet controversial, in Western English speaking countries, Islamic scholar and prolific author.
His name has also been transliterated differently in the English speaking world. Whilst his publishers Dar-Us-Salam in Riyadh translate it as 'Muhammad bin Jamil Zeno', it is also rendered as Muhammad Bin/Ibn Jamal/Jamaal/Jameel Zeeno/Zaino/Zayno/Zaynoo/Zeenoo/Zino/Zainu.
Biography.
Zeno was born in Aleppo, Syria in 1925 (1344 AH). At the age of 10 he attended a boarding school for 5 years, during which he became a Hafiz.
He then went on to study forensic science at the University of Aleppo, which was part of the Islamic Waqf. He became a Sheikh and joined the House of Teachers in Aleppo where he taught for 29 years before leaving to teach in a madrasah in the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Later he traveled to Jordan to give Dawah where he became an Imam, teacher and influential preacher.
In 1979/1980 (1400 AH) he went onto teach in Dar-ul-Hadith al-khairiyah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia where he was a teacher for many years.
Earlier in his life, Zeno was a Sufi of the Hanafi Madhhab and Shadhili Tariqah who later left these practices for Salafism.
Career.
Because of his simple style, his books gained popularity in the Islamic world, especially in Western countries. He uses authentic sources while writing the books, which is why they are appreciated by scholars. Generally in the Islamic world, the authenticity of a book is judged by its author's name and his name has acquired such position.
His work is widely recognised but is also controversial, especially in prisons.
Controversy.
Zeno (as Zainu) features heavily in the 2005 report 'Saudi Publications On Hate Ideology Invade American Mosques'., by Freedom House, the New York-based human rights organization.
Zeno’s book, ‘Islamic Guidelines for Individual and Social Reform’, featured in the 2007 PBS Frontline documentary , which was part of the America at a Crossroads television series. The documentary states that his books were distributed to prisons by the controversial Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation.
Zeno featured heavily a study by the right-leaning Centre for Social Cohesion, 'Hate on the State: How British libraries encourage Islamic extremism' by James Brandon and Douglas Murray, in which he has been described as ""One of the most virulent Wahhabi clerics whose books are stocked in the Tower Hamlets libraries."" which BBC News also reported on.

Anastasios Katsabis

Anastasios Katsabis (born 30 July 1973) is a former Greek football player, who lastly played for Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. in Greek Super League as a centre back. Katsabis started his career as a midfielder, but when at PAOK, Angelos Anastasiadis tried him as a centre back because of his height. It was by playing his new position that he gained his first call-up in the Ethniki.
Club career.
Early career.
Katsabis started his career in the amateur club of Iraklis Neo Irakleio. In 1992 he got transferred to the semi-professional club Acharnaikos, at that time playing in the Delta Ethniki. Katsabis assisted the club to achieve its promotion to the Gamma Ethniki by scoring 6 goals. In the next season Katsabis was an automatic choice in the starting 11 of Acharnaikos missing just one match out of 34 and scoring 7 goals. His good performances attracted the attention of Alpha Ethniki club Panionios that signed him in the summer of 1994.
Panionios.
Katsabis was titular in Panionios from his first season in the club. In the 1994–95 season he played in 29 matches and scored 2 goals, helping Panionios to avoid relegation. In his second season for the club he featured in 30 matches and scored 3 goals, but Panionios suffered relegation to the Beta Ethniki. Panionios was a firm favorite for promotion in the next season, and Katsabis propelled the club to winning the Betta Ethniki championship by scoring 11 goals in 31 games. The next season was the best of the club since years as the club won the Greek Cup. Katsabis was in the starting 11 of the final. In the league he featured in 28 matches and scored 5 goals. After the Greek Cup success Katsabis along with other teammates (Vokolos, Nalitzis, Fyssas), attracted the attention of the top clubs in Greece. He finally signed for PAOK in the summer transfer window of 1998.
PAOK.
From day one Katsabis was an important first team player for PAOK. In his first season he helped PAOK to finish in the 4th position and win qualification to the UEFA CUP. In total he played in 31 matches and scored 4 goals. In his next season PAOK ended up in the 5th position in the league and Katsabis was once again mainly in the starting 11 (27 matches). The next season brought glory to both PAOK and Katsabis. PAOK won the Greek Cup. Katsabis captained the club in the final, a match held in Nikos Goumas Stadium, Athens that found PAOK victorious against Olympiacos by 4–2. In the league Katsabis featured in 23 matches and scored 2 goals. In his last season for the PAOK he played in 25 matches and scored 2 goals helping the club to achieve its 6th consecutive UEFA Cup qualification.
Iraklis.
After his successful spell with PAOK Katsabis signed a contract with Iraklis Thessaloniki. He has proved himself indispensable for the club, as he is an automatic first team choice, in all nine years he plays for Iraklis.

Henry Robert Stephens

Henry Robert Stephens (born 5 August 1665 at Liège – 15 June 1723) was a Belgian Jesuit theologian.
Life.
He entered the Society of Jesus, 7 September 1683, and for over twenty years was attached to the episcopal seminary of Liège, first as professor of dogmatic theology and later as its superior. During this period the Jansenists were active in Belgium, both in attacking the Jesuits and in opposing the papal Decrees condemnatory of Jansenism. All of Father Stephens's published works were occasioned by these attacks.
Works.
In "Specimen doctrinæ a Jesuitis in Seminario Leodiensi traditæ" the Jesuits were accused, among other things, of corrupting faith and morals by their teaching. In answer to these accusations Stephens published a set of theses, "Conclusiones theologicæ miscellaneæ" (Liège, 1702) and had them publicly defended by one of his pupils.
In answer to another Jansenistic work known as the "Epistola Leodiensis de formula Alexandri VII", he published his "Vera defensio authoritatis Ecclesiæ" (Liège, 1707). The Jansenist, Henry Denys, thereupon defended the "Epistola" in an anonymously published work which called forth Stephens's "Author epistolæ Leodiensis denuo confutatus" (Liège, 1709).
His other works are the "Dissertatio theologica de Condemnatione Libri Janseniani" (Liège, 1710), and the "Consilium pacis adversariis propriis inter se disputantibus" (Liège, 1710). In all these works his name appears in the Latinized form of Stephani.

Lightship No. 114

Lightship No. 114 was a historic lightship at the State Pier in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
Built in Portland, Oregon, she left Portland on 5 August 1930 for her first station at Fire Island, New York. She arrived on 20 September. Serving there until 1942, she was armed for war and placed into service as an examination vessel for the remainder of World War II. Her log reports how real the threat to shipping on the east coast was as the log mentions flares being spotted from a German U-boat.
Following the war, "LV 114" was reassigned to Diamond Shoals off Cape Hatteras. She served there for two years before becoming a Relief lightship. For the next eleven years she served on relief duty until assigned to Pollock Rip station in 1958. When the Pollock Rip station was discontinued, "LV 114" was moved north to Portland, Maine where she served for the final two years of her career. She was put out of service in 1971.
The Coast Guard originally planned to use "LV 114" as a museum but those plans fell through. Instead, she was awarded to the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1975. In 1976 the lightship received a cosmetic overhaul and played a starring role in the city's bicentennial celebrations. In 1990 "LV 114" was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but little was done to preserve or promote her after the Bicentennial, and in 2006 she sank at her pier.
Shortly after her sinking, "LV 114" was refloated and the city of New Bedford tried to auction the ship off. The starting bid was $25,000, but no one bid on the ship. Even after the city reduced the starting bid to $10,000 no one stepped forward to bid. After the failed attempts to sell the lightship, the city had historical artifacts removed from her, then placed the ship on eBay. After four days, the ship sold for $1,775 to Sea Roy Enterprises. The city however decided not to dispose of "LV 114" for such a small amount. Eventually, Sea Roy Enterprises agreed in May, 2007 to pay the city $10,000 for the lightship. The following month she was broken up and her remains sold to salvage yards.

When it was formed in 1996, its focus was on sexual equality; it now also has oversight over such issues as “migration and integration of foreigners, disability, social discrimination and sexual orientation.” Its role includes “advising and making recommendations to authorities and private parties, carrying out investigations, participating in the development and enactment of national programs relevant to its mandate, and carrying out projects to further its aims.” Amnesty International has expressed concern about the OEO's limited resources. Originally staffed by two full-time employees and an intern, it now has only one full-time staffer. 
Amnesty International's first Universal Periodic Review of Liechtenstein in 2008 called for the establishment of “an ombudsman institution and a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles,” and a 2012 Amnesty International report regretted Liechtenstein's failure to follow this suggestion and expressed concern “that the alternative mechanisms already in place, including the Office for Equal Opportunity and the planned Ombudsman for children, do not fully meet the criteria by the Paris Principles and are not the appropriate authorities to consider cases of human rights violations.” 
A 2012 report by a committee of the Office of the UN's High Commissioner on Human Rights similarly recommended that the Office of Equal Opportunity and other such government agencies in the principality be replaced with “a single independent human rights institution with a broad mandate.”
Fundamental freedoms.
Article 31 of Liechtenstein's Constitution guarantees equal treatment of all citizens. Elections are free and fair. Human-rights groups are freely allowed to investigate conditions in Liechtenstein. The country recognizes freedom of speech and of the press, although public insult directed against any racial or ethnic group can be punished by up to two years. There are no Internet restrictions. People in Liechtenstein enjoy academic freedom, religious freedom, freedom of movement within the country, and the right to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to repatriate. The right of free assembly and of free association is guaranteed by article 41 of the Constitution and by article 11 of the ECHR. “All public, non-religious events necessitating official measures and especially security measures require approval in Liechtenstein,” according to a government report. “Political and educational events in particular
are exempt. For the (few) demonstrations that have so far taken place in Liechtenstein,
approval has always been granted.”
According to a 2003 report by the government of Liechtenstein, anyone in the country “who believes that his or her fundamental rights and freedoms have been violated is entitled to apply to the courts or to file a complaint on the matter. Relief may take the form, inter alia, of an order to set aside an administrative or government decision, or an order for the payment of compensatory, nominal or substantial damages. It is the function of the Constitutional Court (Staatsgerichtshof) of Liechtenstein to rule on the constitutionality of existing laws and, where necessary, to render void laws or ordinances,
or parts thereof. An appeal may also be lodged, in specific cases, with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, Liechtenstein having acceded, on 8 September 1982, to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950. Such appeals are subject to the condition that all avenues of domestic remedies within Liechtenstein have been exhausted.”
Rights related to asylum, refugee status, and citizenship.
The laws of Liechtenstein allow for the granting of asylum or refugee status, although none of the 88 asylum applications submitted between January and September 2010 was successful. Two 2010 reports by the UN Committee against Torture and the UNHCR said that the requirement that asylum seekers “under preventive expulsion” request a hearing within 24 hours was too short. A 2012 report by a committee of the UN's Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights asked that the principality “consider amending the Asylum Law to provide for facilitated naturalization of refugees and stateless persons.” The same report recommended that Liechtenstein also “consider amending the Act on Facilitated Naturalization with a view to reducing the required period of residence for the acquisition of citizenship and consider introducing the right to appeal and legal review under the ordinary naturalization procedure subject to municipal popular votes.”
Racial discrimination.
Discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity is forbidden. In connection with its 2000 ratification of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Liechtenstein tighted provisions in its legal code related to racial discrimination. Right-wing extremists have attacked foreigners, mainly Turks, from time to time. The head of a group of skinheads who threatened and injured a Turkish business owner in 2009 was fined 1000 Swiss franks. An arsonist who attacked a kebab shop in 2010 was sentenced to two and a half years. A 2006 UNESCO report expressed concern about the persistence in Liechtenstein of “xenophobia and intolerance against persons of different ethnic origin or religion, particularly against Muslims and persons of Turkish origin.” 
Women's rights.
Since January 1996, Liechtenstein has been a signatory of the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Discrimination on the basis of gender is illegal. Rape, domestic violence, and sexual harassment are crimes. The government provides for a wide range of assistance to victims of domestic violence, and Frauenhaus, a women's shelter, provides shelter and counseling to women and children. The Equal Opportunity Office and Commission on Equality between Women and Men work to ensure equal rights. A 2012 report by a committee of the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights asked Liechtenstein to “ensure that migrant women and other women in vulnerable situations, including those subjected to trafficking, domestic violence or who are divorced, are able to retain their residency status and socio-economic situation and are not subject to double discrimination.”
Family and children's rights.
A child with one parent who is a citizen of Liechtenstein automatically becomes a citizen, as do children born in the country who would otherwise be stateless. Statutory rape is punishable by 1-10 years; the age of consent is 14. Three NGOs that monitor children's rights enjoy government financial support; the Office for Social Services oversees government programs for children. Liechtenstein's first Ombudsperson for children was appointed in 2009, and a report by a UN committee on children's rights recommended that the principality ensure that the office is independent and sufficiently staffed and funded. 
Although Liechtenstein's family law reform of 1992/1993 largely put an end to the differential treatment of children born out of wedlock, custody of such children is still routinely granted only to the mother. To be sure, the parents may apply jointly for joint custody, which may be granted if they live with the child and if authorities consider the situation acceptable.
Gay rights.
An official 2007 study provided evidence of antigay discrimination. Posters put up in 2009 by the Office of Equal Opportunity to discourage antigay attitudes were sprayed with antigay slogans. No arrests were made. In 2011, the Liechtenstein parliament unanimously adopted a law permitting registered partnerships for gay couples, and in a referendum held in June of that year, Liechtenstein voters approved of the new law, with 68.8 percent supporting it. 
Employment rights.
All workers have the right to unionize and bargain collectively. Liechtenstein's one trade union represents about 3 percent of employed persons; collective bargaining agreements cover about 25 percent. Children over 14 who have left school may work on a limited basis; those still in school may work for no more than nine hours a week performing light duties. There is no officially established minimum wage, although the Liechtenstein Workers Association, Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber for Economic Affairs set an effective minimum wage in annual negotiations. The maximum workweek is 45 hours for white-collar workers and 48 hours for others. Working on Sunday is illegal, with few exceptions. Workers living in Switzerland and Austria are covered by the same rules.
Rights relating to arrest, trial, and punishment.
Arrest warrants are issued by the national court. Within 48 hours of arresting a suspect, police must bring the individual before a magistrate who must either file formal charges or order the prisoner's release. Defendants have a right to counsel, and those who cannot pay for a lawyer are provided with one at government expense.
Liechtenstein guarantees the right to a fair trial by a single judge, a panel of judges, or a jury, depending on the seriousness of the case. 
The conditions in Liechtenstein's prison meet international standards. Under an 1982 treaty, convicts sentenced to over two years are imprisoned Austria. Prison conditions are monitored by independent body, the Corrections Commission, which makes at least one unannounced visit to the prison per quarter, during which it speaks to prisoners out of the presence of prison officials. Arbitrary arrest and detention are illegal. 
Under the Juvenile Court Act, juvenile offenders are imprisoned separately from adults. This is also forbidden by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which Liechtenstein is a signatory.
The death penalty was abolished in Liechtenstein in 1989.

Nutrient film technique

Nutrient film technique (NFT) is a hydroponic technique wherein a very shallow stream of water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for plant growth is re-circulated past the bare roots of plants in a watertight gully, also known as channels. In an ideal system, the depth of the recirculating stream should be very shallow, little more than a film of water, hence the name 'nutrient film'. This ensures that the thick root mat, which develops in the bottom of the channel, has an upper surface, which, although moist, is in the air. Subsequent to this, an abundant supply of oxygen is provided to the roots of the plants. A properly designed NFT system is based on using the right channel slope, the right flow rate, and the right channel length. The main advantage of the NFT system over other forms of hydroponics is that the plant roots are exposed to adequate supplies of water, oxygen and nutrients. In earlier production systems, there was a conflict between the supply of these requirements, since excessive or deficient amounts of one results in an imbalance of one or both of the others. NFT, because of its design, provides a system wherein all three requirements for healthy plant growth can be met at the same time, provided that the simple concept of NFT is always remembered and practiced. The result of these advantages is that higher yields of high-quality produce are obtained over an extended period of cropping. A downside of NFT is that it has very little buffering against interruptions in the flow, e.g., power outages, but, overall, it is one of the more productive techniques.
The same design characteristics apply to all conventional NFT systems. While slopes along channels of 1:100 have been recommended, in practice it is difficult to build a base for channels that is sufficiently true to enable nutrient films to flow without ponding in locally depressed areas. As a consequence, it is recommended that slopes of 1:30 to 1:40 be used. This allows for minor irregularities in the surface, but, even with these slopes, ponding and water logging may occur. The slope may be provided by the floor, or benches or racks may hold the channels and provide the required slope. Both methods are used and depend on local requirements, often determined by the site and crop requirements.
As a general guide, flow rates for each gully should be 1 litre per minute. At planting, rates may be half this, and the upper limit of 2L/min appears about the maximum. Flow rates beyond these extremes are often associated with nutritional problems. Depressed growth rates of many crops have been observed when channels exceed 12 metres in length. On rapidly growing crops, tests have indicated that, while oxygen levels remain adequate, nitrogen may be depleted over the length of the gully. As a consequence, channel length should not exceed 10–15 metres. In situations where this is not possible, the reductions in growth can be eliminated by placing another nutrient feed halfway along the gully and reducing flow rates to 1L/min through each outlet. Care needs to be taken to maintain hygienic conditions and to avoid heavy metal contamination of NFT systems by using mainly plastic or stainless steel pumps and components.
A leading protagonist of NFT was Dr Alan Cooper, a scientist at the Glasshouse Crops Research Station in England who published the book "The ABC of NFT" (Grower Books, London, UK, 1979, 1844pps,Reprinted by Casper Press, Narrabeen, Australia). NFT systems were used by a significant proportion of commercial growers in the UK through the 1980-1990 period but were only used for lettuce in Europe. Dutch growers particularly rejected NFT because of the perceived high risk of disease spread by the recirculating solution.
NFT ensures that plants have unlimited access to water at all times, but it is now recognized that fruiting crops can benefit from carefully limited water supplies. Leafy crops like lettuce benefit from unlimited water supplies and are still widely grown using NFT, but now most commercial greenhouse crops of tomatoes, capsicums and cucumbers are grown hydroponically using some kind of inert media, with rockwool being the most important media worldwide. NFT remains a very popular system for home use.
Potato minitubers.
Most potato varieties are maintained in plant tissue culture and micropropagation methods are used to increase the amount of planting material. Since tissue culture plants perform poorly when planted into field soil, they are instead planted into greenhouses or screenhouses to generate tubers, which are referred to as minitubers. In many countries, it is common for NFT or aeroponic systems to be used for production of minitubers from tissue culture plantlets. The minitubers are planted into the field 6 to 14 months after harvest to grow a crop of potatoes. This first crop of field-grown potatoes is typically replanted to generate more potatoes rather than consumed.

State Intelligence Service (Sri Lanka)

The State Intelligence Service (SIS) is an intelligence agency of the Sri Lankan government. It is tasked with both internal and external intelligence. It comes directly under the Ministry of Defence and was formally known as the National Intelligence Bureau.
History.
Until 1984, the Sri Lanka Police were responsible for internal intelligence functions, first under the Special Branch, and later under the Intelligence Services Division. The perceived failure of the Intelligence Services Division during the riots of July 1983 led the J.R. Jayawardene Government to re-evaluate the nation's intelligence network, and in 1984 the President set up a National Intelligence Bureau. The new organization combined intelligence units from the Army, Navy, Air force, and Police. It has been since renamed the State Intelligence Service in 2006.

Joseph Deharbe

Joseph Deharbe (11 April 1800 at Strasburg, Alsace – 8 November 1871 at Maria-Laach) was a German Jesuit theologian and catechist.
Life.
He entered the Society of Jesus in 1817 and after teaching for eleven years at the Jesuit College at Brieg, Switzerland, he became in 1840 a missionary and catechist in Köthen. With Father Rohe, S.J., he established at Lucerne in 1845 the academy of St. Charles Borromeo. In 1847 he left Switzerland, which had become hostile to Jesuits.
After that he was chiefly engaged in giving missions in Germany.
Works.
As a catechist in Köthen he felt the lack of a good catechism, and was encouraged by his superior, Fr. Devis, to compose one. As a model he took the Mainz catechism of 1842 and made use also of other good textbooks, notably of Bossuet's catechism. He completed his first catechism, called "Katholischer Katechismus oder Lehrbegriff" in 1847. 
In 1848 it appeared anonymously at Ratisbon and immediately won approval. Bishop Blum of Linsburg introduced it officially into his diocese the same year; the following year the bishops of Trier and Hildesheim did likewise for their dioceses. In 1850 the Bavarian bishops resolved to introduce a common catechism for the entire kingdom, and accepted Deharbe's catechism, which was then introduced in 1853. Other German dioceses adopted it as follows: Cologne, 1854; Mainz and Paderborn, 1855; Fulda, 1858; Ermland, 1861; Culm, 1863; Gnesen-Posen, 1868. At the same time it spread outside of Germany, in Switzerland, Austria-Hungary, and the United States. It was translated in 1851 into Magyar, then into Bohemian, Italian, and French; into Swedish and Marathi, 1861; into Polish and Lithuanian, 1862; into Slovenian, 1868; into Danish, 1869; and later repeatedly into Spanish and Portuguese. It was reintroduced into Bavaria in 1908. In a revised form, Austria adopted it in 1897. 
Deharbe himself prepared and published at Ratisbon four extracts of his first work, titled
He preserved catechetical tradition, but abandoned the of division of Peter Canisius, arranging the text-matter under chapters on Faith, Commandments, and Means of Grace. 
His other works, all published at Ratisbon, are:
