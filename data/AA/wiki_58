Nava Telangana Praja Party

Nava Telangana Party (NTPP) was a political party in Andhra Pradesh, India. The party was founded by Tulla Devender Goud to achieve separate statehood for Telangana. According to the party the people of Telangana were being treated as second class citizens, due to lack of drinking water for in spite of having two major rivers (Krishna and Godavari) flowing in the region.
NTPP intended to contest the 2009 Andhra Pradesh assembly election in all constituencies of the Telangana districts (Hyderabad, Khammam, Mahbubnagar, Nizamabad, Nalgonda, Adilabad, RR, Karimnagar, Warangal, and Medak) together with like-minded parties with the objective of creating a separate Telangana state.
Birth of NTP.
Devender Goud announced the new party (NTPP) on July 11, 2008 in Hyderabad, along with flag, and its symbol.
NTPP flag details.
NTPP flag consists of a Telangana state regions map surrounded in blue color. Blue color was chosen to reflect rivers around the regions of Telangana state and also reflects the color of bird Indian Roller (Pala Pitta bird in Telugu language) which is regarded as most auspicious to watch on the occasion of Dasara festival by the people of Telangana .
Interior of Telangana region on the flag is chosen to be brown in color. Brown color reflects the color of earth or land. The Telangana region map on the flag also contains plough, spade, book, and torch in the centre to symbolize youth, farmers, workers, and students.
NTPP head office.
Nava Telangana Praja Party head office was formally inaugurated on August 14, 2008 by Fatima Begum, mother of Shaik Fakir, belonging to warangal, who died during agitation for separate statehood of Telangana in 1968 at the age of 19, along with Venkamma, mother of Narsimlu who died in police firing at the age of 14 during agitations for a separate Telangana state.
NTPP also paid homage to 369 people who lost their life during separate statehood agitation of telangana in 1969 and also felicitated activists who lost family members in the agitation.
Merger of NTP with PRP, TDP.
On 26 February 2009, Goud announced that NTP was merging with Praja Rajyam Party, because of funds. He reversed this decision and merged his party with the Telugu Desam Party on 3 August 2009. When asked to comment on this decision, Goud has cited the reason for the merger as a thought taken from all his supporters.

Bavarian P 3/5 H

After the foundation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn the Bavarian Group Administration tasked the firm of Maffei with the construction of 80 locomotives of the Bavarian Class P 3/5 H. These machines were based on the Class P 3/5 N, but had a superheated steam boiler. Positive experience with these vehicles built in 1921 – they were even used on express train duties – led in 1924 to the rebuild of all available Class P 3/5 N engines into superheated steam locomotives. 
In 1925 the P 3/5 H were allocated the numbers 38 401 to 38 480 as part of the DRG Class 38.4. 
All 80 locomotives survived the Second World War and entered service with the Deutsche Bundesbahn. The last engine of this class, number 38 432, ran in Bavaria and Upper Swabia and was taken out of service in 1955.
The vehicles were coupled with a Bavarian 2'2' T 21,8 tender.

Ricardo Teixeira

Ricardo Terra Teixeira (; born June 20, 1947) was president of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) from January 16, 1989 to March 12, 2012. In July 2012 a Swiss prosecutor's report revealed that, during his tenure on FIFA's Executive Committee, he and his former father-in-law Joao Havelange took more than $41 million in bribes in connection with the award of World Cup marketing rights.
Life and career.
Born in Carlos Chagas, Ricardo Teixeira married Lúcia Havelange, the daughter of João Havelange. They divorced in 1997 after almost 30 years of marriage. His son, Ricardo Teixeira Havelange born in 1974 bears his mother's last name, opposing the Brazilian custom.
In 1989, Teixeira was first elected the president of CBF succeeding Octávio Pinto Guimarães and defeating Nabi Abi Chedid, the president of Federação Paulista de Futebol at the time. BBC journalist Tim Vickery has suggested that he would not have been elected "had he not at the time been the son-in-law of vastly influential former FIFA boss Joao Havelange." At the time of his resignation Teixeira was serving his sixth term as head of the CBF.
Angry that his television company had been rejected in a contest for domestic rights, in 1993 Brazilian footballer Pelé accused Teixeira of corruption, which led to an eight year feud between Pelé and Havelange. As a result Havelange banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms that resulted from the banning of Pelé were perceived to have had a negative effect on Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA President in 1994.
Corruption allegations.
In 1994, after winning the World Cup in the USA, the Brazilian Team returned home in a private flight. On arrival in Brazil, Teixeira refused to abide by the rules of Brazilian Customs, on the grounds that "a title of the Brazilian Team is worthy much more than the custom taxes"; later on, it was discovered that many players had brought boxes of undeclared stuff (particularly computers and electronic appliances, which were expensive in Brazil at the time), and that Mr. Teixeira himself had packed a full beer making machine, that he used in a bar he opened a few months later - after a long dispute with Brazilian IRS, Teixeira paid the due taxes and fines.
In 2000, Teixeira faced a Probing Commission in Brazilian Congress. He was charged of taking illegal advantage of contracts with Nike: the Brazil Team would satisfy Nike's interests, and Teixeira would rake the financial gains. Again, Teixeira had to pay taxes on the basis of non declared revenues.
In November 2010 Andrew Jennings, the presenter of "FIFA's Dirty Secrets", an edition of BBC's flagship current affairs programme "Panorama" alleged that Teixeira had taken bribes in the 1990s regarding the awarding of contracts for the sale of television rights to the football World Cup., Teixeira waited until 25 July 2011 to respond to the allegations, at which point he attacked The Football Association, saying he would "make their lives hell" as long as he remained a member of FIFA's ruling Executive Committee.
The Brazilian authorities started in October 2011 an investigation to evaluate the possibility of money laundering by Ricardo Teixeira through the Brazilian Football Confederation. The authorities will have 90 days to complete the investigation which also alleges the involvement of João Havelange as part of the scheme. Andrew Jennings told the Senate committee that Ricardo Teixeira may have amassed $9.5m in bribes from now-defunct FIFA marketing firm ISL.
In July 2012 after protracted court proceedings, Havelange and Teixeira were named as beneficiaries of bribes from ISL. A document released by a prosecutor in the canton of Zug revealed that from 1992 to 2000 Havelange and Teixeira were paid 41m CHF by ISL.
At the time of the payment of the bribes, commercial bribery was not a crime in Switzerland. In 1997 as President of FIFA Havelange had granted ISL FIFA's exclusive marketing rights, and exclusive TV and radio rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups in 1998. ISL paid FIFA 200m CHF for the marketing rights and $1.4bn for the TV rights. After ISL's bankruptcy its liquidators examined all payments made by the company.
FIFA, under the presidency of Sepp Blatter, was found to have known about the bribes, yet argued it did not need to have the money repaid. Prosecutions were mounted for alleged embezzlement against Havelange and Teixeira, but were stopped in May 2010, after Havelange and Texeira repaid 500,000 and 2.5m CHF respectively. The repayments were considered reasonable due to the fact that bribes paid before 1995 were outside the statute of limitations, and Havelange's advanced age. The prosecutor also believed that Havelange and Teixeira were guilty of criminal breaches of their duties to serve FIFA as senior executives.
"piauí" controversy.
The July 2011 issue of the Brazilian magazine "piauí" published a profile of Ricardo Teixeira written by journalist Daniela Pinheiro. Ms. Pinheiro spent 10 days in Switzerland with Teixeira while he was there to attend the 61st FIFA Congress. In the 8-page article, Teixeira talked about football politics, the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the Brazilian press and corruption allegations against him and other FIFA members. During the course of the interviews, he brushed off the accusations with profanities (such as "caguei", a Portuguese swear-word for the verb "to defecate" which also means, roughly, "I couldn't care less") and boasted he was able to do whatever he wanted during the 2014 World Cup - like denying press credentials to those who are critical of him or changing match schedules at his own pleasure.
All of Teixeira's declarations were later confirmed by Rodrigo Paiva, head of public relations for the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The remarks stirred a lot of controversy in both the Brazilian press and Brazilian society, and sparked the Twitter campaign "#foraricardoteixeira" ("Out with Ricardo Teixeira").

Roman numeral analysis

In music, Roman numeral analysis involves the use of Roman numerals to represent chords. In this context, Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, ...) typically denote scale degrees (first, second, third, fourth, ...). When a Roman numeral is used to represent a chord, it is meant to indicate the scale degree corresponding to its root note, which is the note on which the chord is built. For instance, III is the Roman numeral which denotes either the third degree of a scale, or the chord built on that degree. In many cases, uppercase Roman numerals (such as I, IV, V) represent major chords while lowercase Roman numerals (such as i, iv, v) represent the minor chords (see Major and Minor below for alternative notations); elsewhere, upper-case Roman numerals are used for all chords.
In the most common day-to-day use, Roman numerals allow musicians to quickly understand the progression of chords in a piece. For instance, the standard twelve bar blues progression is denoted by the roman numerals I7 (first), IV7 (fourth), and V7 (fifth). In the key of C (where the notes of the scale are C, D, E, F, G, A, B), the first scale degree (Tonic) is C, the fourth (Subdominant) is F, and the fifth (Dominant) is a G. So the I7, IV7, and V7 chords are C7, F7, and G7. Similarly, if one were to play the same progression in the key of A (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) the I7, IV7, and V7 chords would be A7, D7, and E7. In essence, Roman numerals provide a way to abstract chord progressions, by making them independent of the selected key. This allows chord progressions to be easily transposed to any key.
Overview.
Roman numeral analysis is the use of Roman numeral symbols in the musical analysis of chords. In music theory related to or derived from the common practice period, Roman numerals are frequently used to designate scale degrees as well as the chords built on them. In some contexts, arabic numerals with carets are used to designate scale degrees (); theory related to or derived from jazz or modern popular music may use Roman numerals or arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...) to represent scale degrees "(See also diatonic function)". In some contexts an arabic number, or careted number, may refer also to a chord built upon that scale degree. For example, formula_1 or 1 may both refer to the chord upon the first scale step.
Gottfried Weber's "Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst" ("Theory of Musical Composition") (Mainz, B. Schott, 1817-21) is credited with popularizing the analytical method by which a chord is identified by the Roman numeral of the scale-degree number of its root. However, the practice originated in the works of Abbé Georg Joseph Vogler, whose theoretical works as early as 1776 employed Roman numeral analysis (Grave and Grave, 1988) 
Common practice numerals.
The current system used today to study and analyze tonal music comes about initially from the work and writings of Rameau’s fundamental bass. The dissemination of Rameau’s concepts could only have come about during the significant waning of the study of harmony for the purpose of the basso continuo and its implied improvisational properties in the later 18th century. The use of Roman numerals in describing fundamentals as “scale degrees in relation to a tonic” was brought about, according to one historian, by John Trydell’s "Two Essays on the Theory and Practice of Music", published in Dublin in 1766. However, another source says that Trydell used Arabic numerals for this purpose, and Roman numerals were only later substituted by Georg Joseph Vogler. Alternatives include the functional hybrid Nashville number system and macro analysis.
Jazz and pop numerals.
In music theory aimed towards jazz and popular music, all triads are represented by upper case numerals, followed by a symbol to indicate if it is not a major chord (e.g. "-" for minor or "ø" for half-diminished):

<doc id="18428613" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18428613" title="Chao Cuo">
Chao Cuo

Chao Cuo (, ca. 200–154 BC) was a Chinese political advisor and official of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), renowned for his intellectual capabilities and foresight in martial and political matters. Although not against the philosophy of Confucius (551–479 BC), he was described by later Eastern Han scholars as a Legalist. He was an early advocate of revoking the "heqin" treaty with the Xiongnu nomads of the north. He compared the relative strengths and weaknesses of both Han Chinese and Xiongnu military tactics. In a written work of 169 BC, he advocated a systematic policy to populate and defend frontier zones. He proposed that civilian migrants supported by the government could simultaneously train as militia units while developing and cultivating remote regions which were under frequent attack by nomadic forces. He fell victim to execution when political rivalries at the imperial court convinced Emperor Jing that Chao's death would curtail or at least mitigate the Rebellion of the Seven States.
Career.
Chao Cuo was born in Yuzhou, Henan and served the imperial courts of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC) and Emperor Jing of Han (157–141 BC). While he served as a subordinate official in the Ministry of Ceremonies, he was once called upon by Emperor Wen to serve as a high dignitary in studying with the elderly Master Fu, or Fu Sheng, an academician ("boshi" 博士) who served the previous Qin Dynasty (r. 211–206 BC) and had hidden and partially recovered a copy of the "Classic of History" during the Qin regime's purge of opposition literature. However, since Fu was too old to give lectures, he had his educated daughter teach Chao instead.
The capstone of Chao's political career in the capital Chang'an was his appointment in 155 BC to the post of Imperial Secretary (variants: Grandee Secretary, Imperial Counselor)—one of the three most senior posts in the central government. He was well known for his knowledge about politics, warfare, agriculture, economics, border defense, and frontier management.
Views on policies.
Foreign policy stances.
Chao was one of the first known ministers to suggest to Emperor Wen that Han armies should have a cavalry-centric army to match the nomadic Xiongnu to the north, since Han armies were still primarily infantry, with cavalrys and chariots playing a supporting role. He advocated the policy of "using barbarians to attack barbarians," that is, incorporating surrendered Xiongnu horsemen into the Han military, a suggestion that was eventually adopted, especially with the establishment of dependent states of different nomads living on Han's frontiers. Like Jia Yi (201–168 BC), he was an early proponent of terminating the "heqin" marriage alliance and tribute treaty with the Xiongnu, although he opposed it for practical reasons rather than Jia's staunch ideological position that superior sedentary Chinese culture should dominate over the northern nomads. The "heqin" agreement was supposed to guarantee peace and stability between the Han and Xiongnu. Chao believed that the "heqin" agreement had been breached and ignored by the Xiongnu on so many occasions—with continuous raiding and plundering along Han's borders by Xiongnu tribe and clan leaders—that the treaty simply failed to live up to its goals and lost all practical use. It was not until after the Battle of Mayi (133 BC) during Emperor Wu's reign (141–87 BC) that the "heqin" treaty was finally abolished in favor of an offensive military strategy to break apart the Xiongnu Empire.
Views on Han and Xiongnu military tactics.
In a memorandum entitled "Guard the Frontiers and Protect the Borders" that he presented to the throne in 169 BC, Chao compared the relative strengths of Xiongnu and Han battle tactics. In regards to the Han armies, Chao deemed the swift-riding Xiongnu horsemen better prepared for rough terrain due to better stallions, better with horseback archery, and were better able to withstand the elements and harsh climates than Chinese soldiers. However, he viewed Xiongnu cavalry inferior when faced with Han infantry and chariots on flat, level plains. He emphasized the superiority of Han iron armor and weapons over the Xiongnu's leather armor and wooden shields. He deemed the Chinese composite crossbow and repeating crossbow superior to the Xiongnu's composite bow. When dismounted, he believed that the Xiongnu, untrained in infantry tactics, would be decimated by Han infantry.
Frontier development and management.
In his "Rise of the Chinese Empire", historian Chun-shu Chang outlines the main points on frontier development embodied in Chao's "Guard the Frontiers and Protect the Borders" proposal of 169 BC. The following are excerpts from Chao's written memorandum (note: Xiongnu and other terms are spelled in Wade-Giles format). It is clear from historical records that Emperor Wen approved of Chao's proposal and immediately enlisted people for service on the northern frontier. Chao wrote:
It is necessary to settle permanent residents in border regions since expeditionary soldiers from other parts of the empire do not understand the character and capacities of the Hsiung-nu...The government will provide houses and land for the immigrants.
For the immigrants in such border areas, the government will construct walled cities, well protected by high walls, deep moats, catapults, and thorns. Each city, along strategic points and thoroughfares, will be designed to hold no fewer than one thousand households...Each walled city will have an inner wall and an outer wall 150 paces (about 209 meters) apart. Each residential area in the outer-wall area is to be surrounded by "sandy fields" (t'ien-t'ien, "heavenly fields") to detect the intrusion of enemies in the night (intruders will leave footprints in the fields).
The Government will construct houses and provide farming tools before the arrival of the migrants. It will also provide winter and summer clothing and food to the migrants until they become self-supporting...The government will buy mates for those migrants without husbands or wives, for without a mate a migrant will not remain contented on the frontier.
The government will reward anyone who stops a Hsiung-nu raid and will award him half of what he recovers from the enemy.
First enlist ordinary and pardoned convicts, then slaves given by their masters to purchase aristocratic ranks, and then all those commoners who desire to go. The government will reward them with ranks, and their families will be exempt from taxation and service requirements.
The government will build frontier communities that are rooted locally, tightly connected, mutually assisted, and militarily united against the "barbarians." This system will be much more efficacious than reliance on garrison soldiers from the interior.
Chao made some later amendments to his proposal, which Emperor Wen adopted as well. These included the following:
Frontier cities will be located close to water resources and an abundance of good arable land.
Houses will each have two bedrooms and one living room and be fully furnished with furniture and necessary appliances. Trees will be planted in the living area.
The government will hire doctors and shamans for each new frontier settlement to take care of the immigrants' medical and religious needs.
In organization, five families will comprise a "wu", to be headed by a "wu-chang" (head of the five-family unit); ten "wu" will comprise a "li" (ward), to be headed by a chia-shih (ward head); four "li" comprise a "lien" (company), to be headed by a chia-wu-pai (head of five hundred); ten "lien" comprise an "i" (city), to be headed by a chia-hou (magistrate). Each leader will be selected from among the migrants who are most talented, able, and familiar with local conditions and who best understand the minds of the people.
All able men will receive military training in peacetime under their local unit leaders and will fight as groups under these leaders.
All migrants will be forbidden to leave their localities without government permission.
Chao's memorial to the throne had a major influence on later court policy under Emperor Wu after his officer Huo Qubing (140–117 BC) decimated Xiongnu forces inhabiting the Hexi Corridor. The Han then colonized this region that stretched from Lanzhou to the Jade Gate, a region which provided access to the Western Regions of the Tarim Basin and Central Asia.
Views on the merchant and peasant classes.
Like his fellow gentry, Chao Cuo viewed the peasants with concern and the merchant class with a certain level of contempt. In regards to the burden of heavy taxes and corvée duties imposed on farming peasants, Chao once pointed out that the average peasant family of five, including two adult males (old enough for labor service) would only be able to cultivate up to 100 "mou" (4.57 hectares or 11.3 acres) which produced roughly 100 "shi" (2,000 liters) of grain, yet during times of famine and drought the state's high taxes forced peasants to take high interest loans which led to debt, poverty, and new reliance on powerful landholding families. The historian Sima Qian (145–86 BC) noted in his "Records of the Grand Historian" (compiled 109 to 91 BC), successful merchants who became wealthy in trade often invested their capital in land, thus joining the elite landholding class. As Chao Cuo makes very clear, the government's anti-merchant policies of raising taxes hardly affected those with great wealth while excessive taxation of peasants drove them from their plot of land and allowed merchants to move in:
Nowadays in a farming family of five members at least two of them are required to render labor service. The area of their arable land is no more than one hundred "mou" acres; the yield from which does not exceed 100 "shih" 2,000 liters. Farmers plough in spring, weed in summer, reap in autumn and store in winter; they cut undergrowth and wood for fuel and render labor services to the government. They cannot avoid wind and dust in spring, sultry heat in summer, dampness and rain in autumn and cold and ice in winter. Thus all year round they cannot afford to take even a day's rest. Furthermore they have to welcome guests on their arrival and see them off on their departure; they have to mourn for the dead and inquire after the sick. Besides they have to bring up infants. Although they work as hard as this they still have to bear the calamities of flood and drought. Sometimes taxes are collected quite unexpectedly; if the orders are issued in the morning they must be prepared to pay by the evening. To meet this demand farmers have to sell their possessions at half price, and those who are destitute have to borrow money at two hundred percent interest. Eventually they have to sell fields and dwellings, or sometimes sell even children and grandchildren into slavery in order to pay back the loan. On the other hand great merchants get profits of two hundred percent by hoarding stocks of commodities while the lesser ones sit in rows in the market stalls to buy and sell. They deal in superfluous luxuries and lead an easy life in the cities. Taking advantage of the urgent demands of the government, they sell commodities at a double price. Though they never engage in farming and their women neither tend silkworms nor weave, they always wear embroidered and multicolored clothes and always eat fine millet and meat. Without experiencing the farmers' sufferings, they make vast gains. Taking advantage of their riches, they associate with kings and marquises. Their power exceeds that of the official and they try to surpass each other in using their profits. They wander idly around roaming as far as a thousand "li"; there are so many of them that they form long lines on the roads. They ride in well-built carriages and whip up fat horses, wear shoes of silk and trail white silk . It is no wonder that the merchants take over farmers and farmers become vagrants drifting from one place to another.
Of this passage, the late Nishijima Sadao 西嶋定生 (1919–1999), professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, wrote: "This indictment reveals striking contrasts between the lives of farmers and merchants in Former Han and shows that severe taxation merely impoverished the former and enriched the latter."
Governing philosophy.
Although leaning more towards a Legalist philosophy, Chao did take part in reviving from oblivion the "Classic of History", one of the early canons of Confucian philosophy. He was also well aware of the failings of the Legalist-based Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). However, Chao's intellectual background was steeped in the writings of Legalist philosophers such as Shang Yang (d. 338 BC) and Shen Buhai (d. 337 BC). The essays written by Chao which are preserved in the 1st century AD "Book of Han" do not reveal any influence of Confucian social or ethical ideas; during the 1st century AD he was also classified as one of the Legalists of the Han.
Downfall.
Chao helped orchestrate the central government's efforts to reduce in size and undermine the subordinate kingdoms in the Han Empire. When disaffected kings of seven different kingdoms plotted rebellion against central authority, Chao's political enemies at court used this as an excuse to persuade Emperor Jing to remove and eliminate Chao to appease these kings. Therefore, Emperor Jing had Chao executed in 154 BC. However, Emperor Jing soon realized the falsity of the claims of Chao's political enemies when the King of Wu, Liu Bi (ruling a semi-autonomous kingdom in northern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu), and his monarchical allies made open revolt against the Emperor.

All India Catholic University Federation

The All India Catholic University Federation (AICUF) is an organisation of catholic university students. The movement was started in 1924, at St.Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli by Fr. Carty, SJ. Currently it operates in 15 states of India. The organization is affiliated to Pax-Romana, an international association of catholic professionals.
Motto.
The AICUF spirit comes from a firm belief in what AICUFers all over believe in. Their motto is ‘We were born into an unjust society and we are determined not to leave it as we have found it.’ Our vision is ‘to sensitise students towards those at the margins and involve ourselves in the struggle for their basic rights by equipping ourselves physically, intellectually and spiritually while networking with NGO's and peoples' movements.
AICUFers all over the country choose to work with Dalits, Tribals,Refugees, Women and they directly work with students and these are their trust areas.
History.
The Catholic Young Men Guild (CYMG), started by a group of college students with the guidance of Fr. P. Carty SJ at St.Joseph’s College, Trichy was an organization in the tradition of ‘Catholic Action’. The guild had the following principal aims:
a) the spirit of Christian Brotherhood
b) informed catholic mind
c) application of catholic principles to social problems
Study clubs were main units for functioning. The Rally, the student magazine accompanied the guild from its inception. It was then merged with the MCYL (Malabar Catholic Youth League) that was founded by Fr. Honore SJ in 1915. CYMG was renamed as CYMF (Catholic Young Men Federation).
In 1937 CYMF grew far and wide in the Southern part of India and got re-christened itself as SICUF. SICUF became AICUF in 1949 as a national level student movement and got recognised by CBCI (Catholic Bishops' Conference of India) . AICUF publishes an alternative student monthly 'THE RALLY' in English. The Rally is a mouth piece of AICUF. It delas with the current educational, social, cultural and political scenario of the country on various themes.
Members.
The AICUF membership is open to university students who share the ideals of the movement as enshrined in the constitution. However, every member state has the autonomy to decide on its own policy regarding membership.
Every member is entitled to participate in all the decision making activities of the unit. However, a member can be selected as an office-bearer only on completion of one year in the AICUF, except in the case of newly formed units.
Structure.
AICUF structure is geared to ensure it mass students movement character. The AICUF functions at the national, state, regional and unit levels. The state is the primary decision making body in AICUF. The various states are linked at the national level as members of a federation.
AICUF Maharashtra.
Mumbai Unit
At present, AICUF unit in Maharashtra exists in St Xavier’s College, Mumbai and in St. Vincent College of Commerce, Pune. The Mumbai unit was revived by Fr Roy Pereira SJ in 1998. The AICUF's vision is "to sensitise students towards those at the margins and involve ourselves in the struggle for their basic rights by equipping ourselves physically, intellectually and spiritually while networking with NGOs and peoples' movements."
AICUF Maharashtra organizes various activities keeping 3 objectives in mind - Social Outreach, Personality Development and Spiritual Growth. These activities include camps, retreats, hikes, exposure visits, exhibitions, seminars, rallies and campaigns. The AICUF has taken up several social issues such as human trafficking, displacement due to Special Economic Zones etc. We also tutor underprivileged children and conduct workshops for them at the Garden School, Colaba. We organise visits to Ashadaan and St Catherine’s Home.
Every year in December, we celebrate AICUF Day which includes sessions, Mass, tele-games and an inter-College Carol singing Competition- Mistletones. Besides the AICUF Day, some of the standard AICUF activities include an annual retreat, the YES (Youth Encounter Sessions) personality development camp in Khandala, Diwali workshops on various skills and crafts, an inter college seminar on a relevant social issue and weekly meetings in the Seminar Room of St. Xavier’s College.
Pune Unit
The Pune unit of AICUF was revived by Fr. James Selvaraj SJ in 2011 at St. Vincent (Night) College of Commerce. The unit is animated by Dr. Gilbi John. At present in 2012-13 Mr. Franklin Fernandes of St. Vincent College, Pune was the National Convener of AICUF in 2012-13. Mr. Franklin created history by becoming the first National Convener from Maharashtra Unit. The College is proud of him. The active leadership of President, Ms. Leonora Mendis has made the Pune unit vibrant. St. Vincent College of Commerce hosted the National AICUF Camp in May at Social Centre, Ahmednagar.

Sweet Passion is a 1977 album by Aretha Franklin, released on Atlantic Records. 
Following a brief resurgence in Aretha's sales with the Gold-certified success of her 1976 soundtrack album, "Sparkle", Aretha paired up with famed Motown producer Lamont Dozier, to produce "Sweet Passion". It was, however, a commercial and critical failure. The album's one single, "Break It To Me Gently", peaked at #85 and dropped off the Hot 100 after only two weeks, although it topped the Billboard R&B Singles Chart. This recording was released on compact disc in Europe in 2008.

Wild Coast Region, Eastern Cape

The Wild Coast is a section of the coast of the Eastern Cape, a province of South Africa. The region stretches from East London in the south to the border of KwaZulu-Natal in the north. It is the traditional home of the Xhosa people, and the birthplace of many prominent South Africans, including Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki.
The Wild Coast is crossed by the N2 National Road.
History.
The Wild Coast from the Great Kei River to the Mtamvuna River was part of the former homeland of the Transkei during the Apartheid era.
In 1986, a bombing occurred at Wild Coast Casino in Mbizana Local Municipality.
Geography.
Many rivers empty into the sea along the Wild Coast. In the southern-most parts of the region, where the hills are lower, the rivers tend to be mature and are characterized by wide floodplains. But in the rugged north, where young rivers find their path to the sea blocked by massive cliffs, many, like Waterfall Bluff, leap over the rocky crags into the surf below.
Small sandy bays and long stretches of open beaches are often found near the mouths of large rivers, such as the Kei, Mthatha, Mbashe and Mzimvuba. There are also many smaller rivers which, owing to their protected sources in the coastal forests, have much less siltation than the larger rivers, which drain vast tracts of land where poor farming practices are in place. Estuaries, bays and headlands are plentiful, whilst rocky shores predominate, be they smooth wave-cut platforms with jagged and un-even surfaces or precipitous cliffs that plunge into the sea.
About half the coastline comprises indigenous forest and many forest species that were previously unknown to science have been discovered in places such as Umtamvuna and Mkambati. About 900 forest and grassland species from the Wild Coast region have been identified as having commercial, traditional or homeopathic value.
Climate.
The average daily temperatures along the coast vary from 17°C to 28°C in January and 9°C to 21°C in July.
Tourism.
The scenic beauty of the Wild Coast, coupled with its rich cultural heritage, make the region ideal for the development of a strong tourism industry. In fact, tourism has been identified as one of the cornerstones of the proposed Wild Coast Spatial Development Initiative. But, the virtual collapse of local administrations and environmental threats like the proposed Xolobeni dune mining project are some of the major issues that will have to be tackled by this initiative. The challenge will be to bring about much needed investment and development that will benefit local communities and the region as a whole, without compromising the rich natural resource base.
The Wild Coast Jikeleza Route near East London is host to the 100 km² Inkwenkwezi Private Game Reserve. The nearby coastal village of Cintsa is also a popular tourist destination.
Other popular tourist towns and villages along the Wild Coast include Port St Johns, Coffee Bay, Hole in the Wall, Qolora, Kei Mouth, Morgan Bay, and Haga Haga.

Aviation safety improvement initiatives

The Aviation Safety Improvement Initiatives are aviation safety partnership between Regulators, manufacturers, operators and professional unions, research organisations, international organisations to further enhance safety.
The major Safety initiatives worldwide are:
Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST).
The Commercial Aviation Safety Team was founded in 1998 with a goal to reduce the fixed-wing commercial aviation fatality rate in the United States by 80 percent by 2007. By 2007 CAST was able to report that by implementing safety enhancements, the fatality rate of commercial air travel in the United States was reduced by 83 percent.
The International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST).
Background, goal and methods.
The International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST) was formed after the International Helicopter Safety Symposium (IHSS) in Montreal, Canada in September 2005, where the central theme was a recognition that long term helicopter accident rates have remained unacceptably high and trends have not shown significant improvement in the last 20 years. A call to action was unanimously accepted by those in attendance at IHSS 2005. 
The IHST was created to lead a government and industry cooperative effort to address the unacceptably high long-term helicopter accident rates. The IHST chose to pursue the goal of reducing the worldwide civil and military helicopter accident rates by 80% in 10 years by adopting the methods that have been used by the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST)[http://www.cast-safety.org/] to substantially reduce the worldwide fatal accident rate in the commercial air carrier community. The process used by CAST was directly linked to real accident data, used a broad spectrum of industry experts to analyze it and had objective success measurements to ensure that the actions taken were having the desired effect.
Accordingly, the IHST chartered the Joint Helicopter Safety Analysis Team (JHSAT) to adapt the CAST process to analyze helicopter accident data and to offer recommendations for reducing the accident rate. The IHST also chartered the Joint Helicopter Safety Implementation Team (JHSIT) to assess the JHSATs’ recommendations and to develop detailed implementation plans for the safety enhancements deemed to have the greatest potential benefit. Industry helicopter safety experts representing operators, airframe and engine manufacturers, and regulators comprise both the JHSAT and the JHSIT. 
Adaptation of the CAST process involved changes to ensure that data unique to the helicopter community could be effectively analyzed; however, the basic tenets of the CAST process were preserved: the analyses would be performed by stakeholders, results would be data driven, and the results would be measurable.
Organization.
The all-volunteer IHST effort is coordinated by an Executive Committee which is currently co-chaired by a senior representative of the US FAA’s Rotorcraft Directorate and by the President of Helicopter Association International (HAI)Other members represent American Helicopter Society (AHS) International [http://www.vtol.org/, Helicopter Association of Canada (HAC)the European Helicopter Association, the European Helicopter Safety Team, the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA)[http://www.nasa.gov, helicopter manufacturers, and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers(OGP) [http://www.ogp.org.uk/].
The initial effort focused on the US helicopter fleet and has grown to encompass international partners in Brazil, Canada, India, Australia, Gulf Cooperative Council, and Japan. In addition EHEST joined in 2007 to cover European helicopter fleet. 
Outreach efforts are underway in Russia, Mexico, South Africa and Korea.
A summary of IHST's recommendations for small operators is posted on HAI's website.
European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI).
The European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI ) is an aviation safety partnership between EASA, other regulators and the industry. The initiative’s objective is to further enhance safety for citizens in Europe and worldwide through safety analysis, implementation of cost effective action plans, and coordination with other safety initiatives worldwide. Participants are drawn from the EASA Member States, the ECAC countries, manufacturers, operators and professional unions, research organisations, the FAA and international organisations such as EUROCONTROL and ICAO. 
ESSI was launched by EASA as a ten year programme on 28 June 2006 and has three components:
The European Commercial Aviation Safety Team (ECAST).
ECAST addresses large aircraft operations. It was launched in October 2006 by the team that created the ESSI. ECAST is in Europe the equivalent of CAST in the US. ECAST aims at further enhancing fixed-wing commercial aviation safety in Europe, and for European citizen worldwide.
The European Helicopter Safety Team (EHEST).
EHEST is also the European component of the International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST). EHEST features representatives of manufacturers, operators, research organisations, regulators, accident investigators and military from across Europe. To address the specificities of the safety of helicopter operations in Europe, the European members of the IHST have established EHEST in November 2006.
The European Helicopter Safety Analysis Team (EHSAT) is the safety team of EHEST. EHSAT has been formed with the purpose of developing a process for analysis of European helicopter accidents and then the performance of the analysis. To tackle the variety of languages used in accident reports and optimise the use of resources, EHSAT has set up seven regional analysis teams across Europe, with the objective of covering more than 89% of the European fleet in 2007. Consolidation of results is performed by EHSAT with the support of EASA.
The European General Aviation Safety Team (EGAST).
In Europe, like in other regions of the world, General Aviation is a dispersed community. Air sports and recreational aviation embrace a wide spectrum of airborne activities, ranging from powered flying, ballooning and gliding to newly invented activities such as sky-surfing, micro light flying and paragliding.
EGAST build on the national general aviation initiatives in Europe and create a forum for sharing safety data and best practices in Europe.

Whole brain literacy

Whole Brain Literacy (WBL), is an alternative approach to integral learning/ teaching process advocated in the Philippines by Dr. Perla Rizalina M. Tayko and Perla S. Intia. and [http://wblphilippines.ning.com. "Learning to Read, Reading to Learn", is the Philippine-published reference book for this concept. The concept is wholly based on the BrainMap model, pioneered in the United States by Dudley Lynch, creater of The BrainMap(R) assessment inventory. 
In a recently published book entitled "Whole Brain Literacy for Whole Brain Learning" by Perla Rizalina M. Tayko, Ph.D. and Marina L. Reyes-Talmo, Ph.D., (2010) the concept and processes of whole brain literacy (WBL) is expanded, differentiated and deepened in its philosophy, perspective, paradigm, processes and application of these to the development of human potential. WBL has many dimensions and definitions. Initially it is defined as an approach or modality of instruction, a technique in asking questions for a dialogic interaction and/or a strategy for curriculum and development. As a perspective, WBL advances the new philosophy of education that draws out the potentials of every learner from the gift of thought and developing it from within or from "inside out" much more than from "outside in" or imposed framework of thinking through processes. The authors, Tayko and Talmo used the term "humanology" to distinguish WBL from other approaches if only to emphasize that the technology being taught to learners are the "human technology" latent in every human being – the whole brain functioning which are based on Lynch's four-brain model, detailed in such books as "The BrainMap Workbook", "Strategy of the Dolphin", and "Your Dolphin High-Performance Business Brain". The four-brain processes as identified and exemplified below and as such WBL taps into these whole brain quadrants through "wending/iterating" as well as "connecting" or weaving as it were on a center core called "core purpose"
Whole Brain Literacy (WBL) can be described as the circulation the human thinking system through brain quadrants described by Lynch in his BrainMap model: I-Control, I-Explore, I-Pursue, and I-Preserve. The circulation has no need to be in order. However, the key idea is to think through all four quadrants. Lynch described the core information-seeking questions for the quadrants as follows:
I-Control: What I know now?
I-Explore: What I want to try?
I-Pursue: How to do it?
I-Preserve: How do I feel?

Fermín Tangüis

Fermín Tangüis (March 29, 1851 - August 24, 1930), was a Puerto Rican businessman, agriculturist and scientist who developed the seed that would eventually produce the Tanguis cotton in Peru and save that nation's cotton industry.
Early years.
Tangüis' father, Enrique Tangüis, emigrated from France to San Juan, Puerto Rico where he met and married a young Puerto Rican girl by the name of Justa Uncal. Tangüis was born in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, and there he received his primary and secondary education. Tangüis moved to Cuba to pursue a university degree; however when the Ten Years' War (1868–1878) broke out in that island, he decided that it would be best to move to South America.
He moved to Lima, Peru in 1873, when he was 22 years old and worked as a mercantile accountant. Tangüis went on to work in the mines of Castrovirreyna and later established his own businesses in Ayacucho and in Huancavelica. In July 1884, he married Isabel Novoa and in 1890, at the age of 39, he purchased land in Valle de Pisco and established a plantation dedicated to cultivation of cotton.
Cotton and its significance in Peru's economy.
Sugar and cotton were the two most important agricultural products of Peru in the 19th century. In 1901, Peru's cotton industry suffered because of a fungus plague caused by a plant disease known some places as "cotton wilt" and in others as "Fusarium wilt" ("Fusarium vasinfectum"). The plant disease, which spread throughout Peru, enters the plant by its roots and works its way up the stem until the plant is completely dried up. Many of the agriculturists who dedicated themselves to the cultivation of cotton were ruined and the cotton industry in general was in crisis.
Tangüis cotton.
Tangüis began to study some species of the plant that were affected by the disease to a lesser extent and experimented in germination with the seeds of various cotton plants. In 1911, after 10 years of experimenting and failures, Tangüis was able to develop a seed which produced a superior cotton plant resistant to the disease. The seeds produced a plant that had a 40% longer (between 29 mm and 33 mm) and thicker fiber that did not break easily and required little water. The cotton grown in Peru (Egyptian cotton) before the fungus plague grew only once a year; the Tangüis cotton grows six times a year. This type of fiber showed a better resistance and performance than other fibers.
Tangüis shared his new seeds with the other cotton growers, who named the plant which the seeds produced Tangüis Cotton. Tangüis cotton grows in Canete’s valley (south of Lima) and in the Central Coast of Peru. The success of the Tangüis cotton, which is also known in Peru as "Oro Blanco" (White Gold), saved the cotton industry of that nation. In 1918, Peru began to export the Tangüis cotton variety, which together with the exportation of sugar, made it possible for the government of Peru to cover its national budget. It is highly regarded world wide and is listed on the Cotton Exchange of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. In 1997, the Tanguis cotton, the variety which is preferred by the Peruvian national textile industry, constituted 75 percent of all the Peruvian cotton production, both for domestic use and apparel exports. The Tanguis cotton crop was estimated at 225,000 bales that year.
Later years.
The President of Peru Augusto B. Leguia (1919 to 1930), honored Tangüis by presenting him with the "Orden del Sol" (Order of the Sun) medal. The Orden del Sol is a decoration which the Government of Peru presents to its citizens and foreigners for their extraordinary accomplishments in the fields of the arts, literature, culture and politics.
Tangüis became a wealthy man and continued to tend to his plantation the remainder of his life. Fermín Tangüis died on August 24, 1930 and is buried in the Maestro Presbitero Cemetery in Lima.
Legacy.
The government and people of Peru have honored his memory by naming various schools and avenues after him. In Lima, there is a statue of Tangüis on a horse. In 1985, Dr. Alberto Giesecke, committee member of the Cosapi National Prize, suggested that books be published about the lives and accomplishments of Peru's civilian heroes. The first book published was that of the life of Fermin Tangüis.

Eugenia reinwardtiana

Eugenia reinwardtiana is a shrub to small tree native to rainforests in northern Queensland, Australia, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. Common names include Cedar Bay Cherry, Mountain Stopper, and Nioi (Hawaii). They are typically in height.
The tree is particularly prevalent around the Cedar Bay National Park and the edible fruit was especially popular with the hippies who lived there in the 1970s.
Uses.
The tree is cultivated to a limited extent for its edible sweetish fruit that is often eaten out-of-hand, used to flavour drinks and candies, or as a preserve. The fruit is a source of antioxidants.
The tree is well-suited to amenity horticulture in the tropics, and is grown in the median strips in Cairns. It is readily propagated from fresh seed.

Tikapa

Tikapa is a locality in the Gisborne Region of New Zealand. It is located at the mouth of the Waiapu River and north of Ruatoria. In 1952 the community numbered 156, predominantly Māori. There are several houses still standing, many of which have been left abandoned. On a hilltop resides the Pokai meetinghouse opened in the late 19th century. Alongside the marae is the Pohatu dining room, and over the paddock is the cemetery, Hinekopeka Urupa. 
On the road heading toward the coast of Tikapa, is a small hilltop cemetery called Taumata. It is said that this is the place where Manuel Josef was buried after his death. Manuel Josef, a Spanish whaler in the early part of the 19th century, was persuaded to stay in the Waiapu Valley by tribal chiefs in the area. One of the chiefs gave away his five daughters to Manuel, and thus produced an offspring which numbers in over 20,000 descendants today. Tikapa Valley was also to be the site of a school in the mid 19th century, to cater for children who were living at Tikapa. However, Sir Apirana Ngata offered to place the school further inward the valley towards Waiomatatini, where it was built and remained there until it closed in the 1970s. However, Tikapa remains an isolated wonder, hidden beyond the outbacks of the East Coast.

Thwaite St Mary

Thwaite St Mary is a rural hamlet (and civil parish) in the English county of Norfolk, it sits just a few miles north of the Suffolk border. Thwaite – sometimes pronounced ‘twayt’ by locals – has approximately thirty-five dwellings and a population of around seventy-nine.
Due to its rural location and minimal air and light pollution, Thwaite is home to an astronomical observatory run by the University of East Anglia. The village also backs on to the tiny Seething Airfield, formerly RAF Seething which utilises part of the runway from an old American wartime airbase. The 1941 control tower still stands and serves as a museum to the war years and to the 448th Bombardment Group (Heavy) in particular. Its unchanged control tower and the fact that it is still an active airfield means that Seething is often used as a location for wartime-themed charity events and air-days. It is also one of the staging posts for the popular Lowestoft summer air-show.
The community in Thwaite is active in organising social and fund-raising events. These events regularly draw a crowd from the wider South-Norfolk and Suffolk area. Together with the appearance of the village and its position in the picturesque Norfolk/Suffolk-borders countryside, this social cohesion contributes to a reputation as a highly desirable place to live.
Thwaite's church of St Mary has an active congregation, and also draws attendees from outside the parish. Its well-kept churchyard and striking Norman arch attract sightseers from the wider area too. Families who have once lived in the village sometimes return to use this pretty church for weddings and memorial services.

Maxwell construction

In thermodynamic equilibrium, a necessary condition for stability is that pressure formula_1 does not increase with volume formula_2. This basic consistency requirement—and similar ones for other "conjugate" pairs of variables—are sometimes violated in analytic models for first order phase transitions. The most famous case is the "Van der Waals equation" for real gases, see Fig.~1 where a typical "isotherm" is drawn (black curve). The Maxwell construction is a way of correcting this deficiency. The decreasing right hand part of the curve in Fig. 1 describes a diluted gas, while its left part describes a liquid. The intermediate (rising) part of the curve in Fig. 1 would be correct, if these two parts were to be joined smoothly—meaning in particular that the system would remain also in this region spatially uniform with a well defined density. But this is not what happens. If the volume of a vessel containing a fixed amount of liquid is expanded at constant temperature, there comes a point where some of the liquid boils and the system consists of two well separated phases. While this two-phase coexistence holds as the volume continues to increase, the pressure remains constant. It decreases again, after all liquid is evaporated and the gas expands. Thus the sinusoidal part of the isotherm is replaced by a horizontal line (red line in Fig.~1). According to the Maxwell construction (or "equal area rule"), the height of the horizontal line is such that the two green areas in Fig.~1 are equal. The Maxwell construction is derived from the condition that the Gibbs free energies of the gas and the liquid must be equal when they coexist. Essentially the same applies to any other thermodynamic system, where formula_1 and formula_2 are replaced by a different pair of "conjugate variables", e.g. magnetic field and magnetization or
chemical potential and number of particles.

Franz Quirin von Kober

Franz Quirin von Kober (b. 6 March 1821, at Warthausen, Biberach, Württemberg; d. at Tübingen, 25 January 1897) was a German Roman Catholic priest, known as a canon lawyer and pedagogist.
Life.
He first attended the Latin school in of Biberach, and subsequently, in accordance with the course prescribed for Catholic theologians of the Diocese of Rottenburg, entered the preparatory seminary at Ethigen on the Danube. From 1840 to 1844 he pursued his studies in the seminary (Wilhelmsstift) of Tübingen, and on 4 September 1845, was ordained priest in Rottenburg am Neckar. 
After half a year's activity in the cure of souls at Ulm, Franz Kober became a tutor in seminary at Tübingen, and lectured on philology and the Pauline Epistles. From 1848 he taught canon law, in opposition to the Josephinist professor Warnkonig, of the faculty of law: Catholic theological students in Württemberg had depended on this faculty for the training in canon law according to a custom existing in Austria since Emperor Joseph II. 
On 28 January 1851, Kober became professor extraordinary in the faculty of Catholic theology, teaching pedagogy, didactics, and the Pauline Epistles. He was appointed professor ordinary of canon law and pedagogy on 8 September 1857, having been professor extraordinary since 19 April 1853.
Works.
He wrote with the historico-legal method some of his works: 
He also treated various ecclesiastico-criminal subjects ("Das Interdikt"; "Die körperliche Züchtigung als kirchliches Strafmittel gegen Kleriker und Mönche", "Die Gefangnisstrafe gegen Kleriker und Mönche"; "Die Geldstrafen im Kirchenrecht") in a series of essays, the majority being lengthy treatises, published in the "Archiv fur katholisches Kirchenrecht" and especially in the "Theologische Quartalschrift" of Tübingen. In the last-named periodical appeared other essays on canon law ("Der Ursprung und die rechtliche Stellung der Generalvikare"; "Der Einfluss der Kirche und ihrer Gesetzgebung auf Gesittung, Humanität und Zivilisation", "Medizin und Kirchenrecht"; "Die Residenz-pflicht der Kirchendiener bei feindlichen Verfolgungen und ansteckenden Krankheiten") and many book reviews. 
Kober was also a frequent contributor to the first and second edition of the Freiburg "Kirchenlexikon".

Asian property market

Ever since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, property markets have greatly developed through the years. Asian governments have improved the financial stance associated with the structure of housing finance, allowing more access to a diverse range of mortgages products.
Housing in Asia has an important role in economic growth. In the early 1990s large urbanization in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and other Southeast Asia countries brought about a large housing price appreciation. Asia attracted global economic interest up until the economic crash of 1997. A decade later, the Asian economy has been stabilized, and has allowed the property market to advance. As a result, foreign investment is continuing to grow. The market is currently experiencing a 50% increase in the amount being invested into Asian countries globally. Although some countries in Asia may not be stable enough for international investment, the majority of the markets are expected to boom.
Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has one of the most developed mortgage market in Asia. Mortgage loans account for 25-30% of bank loans in Hong Kong. Land ownership and land restrictions by the government risk inefficiencies with housing supply and demand.
In 1998 there was a property price collapse; from 1997 to 2003 Hong Kong residential property prices fell by 61% following the Asian economic crisis. Investigations show that there is a distinct correlation between lending and property prices and that the influence is thought to have come from the property prices to the bank credit rather than the other direction. Hong Kong is known for having one of the most expensive real estate sector in the world, in both commercial and residential space. As property value increase, the tendency with Hong Kong property owners is to leave property vacant whilst waiting for a better time to sell it on. This subsequently raises the vacancy rate. (For example in 2007, the vacancy rate for residential properties in Hong Kong was close to 2.5% with an 11% increase in the value of residential properties).
Singapore.
The Singapore property market has an 11 year price cycle. The current cycle is expected to peak in 2010. The Singapore’s property market is however, vulnerable to turbulence in its local economy. The threats that face this include, raising inflation, under performance in forecast economic growth and weaker export business out of the country. 
Due to the nature of the country, the majority of property is in the public sector accounting for 85% of the total households. In the 1990s, the government had schemes to encourages development of private housing, which was successful as private housing share increased rapidly. In 2007, Singapore’s residential property market boomed due to strong economic growth and an influx of professional migrants to Singapore, which particularly boosted the financial service industry. The demand for Singapore office space is driven by the tight supply issue in the Singapore property market and the expanding financial facilities available to service private wealth in Asia. (For example in 2008, according to the Singapore Land Authority the availability of Singapore residential property was tight with only 4,457 new units are under construction or planned for 2008 to 2013).
Indonesia.
Property development news has been mainly focused in Jakarta, the nation’s capital. In 1970s, Jakarta's governor Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin focused on rehabilitating plublic services and re-housing. The government were able to provide low cost housing for residents in the low income bracket as well as providing subsidised loans for low cost housing through state owned mortgage banks. Jakarta became the focus of a real estate boom in the late 1980s, however suffered during the Asian financial crisis, to which the city majorly suffered from. However, the market has slowly rejuvenated. Within the residential sector, there is an ever increasing trend of investment into new builds. Many of the ongoing projects are middle-lower and middle-upper class (dominating the market at 73% in 2008). New builds are located in the north of the city. The demand has been increasing as worsening traffic into Jakarta has influenced commuters decisions to move closer to the workplace, many of the new apartment towers are located adjacent to business centers.
Thailand.
The property market in Thailand, first boomed in the 1980s, this was thanks to a well performing economy, that attracted many people into property investment. A few years later the government encouraged commercial banks to sell their mortgage services and products. Thailand suffered great economic losses during the Asian economic crisis and the market did not regain again until 2000, were the property market saw US$ 2 billion being invested into Thai property. Property prices in Thailand are considerably low compared to other southeast Asian locations, attracting foreign investors, many of which for tourism. For the nationals of Thailand, there are currently commercial banks and government housing banks are dominant in the mortgage lending services with a commercial share of 80-90%. The surge has been observed and analyst believe that Thailand's property market may well be in its infancy. However, in recent years and throughout 2010 there was speculation centered around a potential Thailand condo bubble. Yet Thai authorities claim there is still no sufficient evidence of a property bubble forming in Thailand.
Philippines (outdated information).
The Philippines was arguably the worst effected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, with the biggest drop in property market, and has not yet managed to recover fully to this day. Despite this, with a predicted GPD growth of 7.4% in 2007, the Philippines' economy is strongly growing in both Manila and Cebu City. A growing trend in the economy in 2004 resulted in a small property boom, where all office space, luxury residential and retail markets are still on the rise. This is surprising as Philippines is still perceived as an un-desirable place to do business in Asia although there are plenty of professionals coming into the country and joining the expatriate community. Economic growth is heavily reliant on private consumption and investment. There are 8 million overseas nationals who continue to invest into property in the Philippines, but growth may be vulnerable due to the recent 10% depreciation of the US dollar against the Peso. Manila's CBD (Central Business District), Makati City, is the most expensive district in the city for office space. On the contrary, Manila still remains to be one of the cheapest places in Asia to buy luxury residential property. A recent surge in supply for this will trouble the market and previous investors within the next few years.

Northern Villages (Southern Highlands, New South Wales)

Northern Villages is the name that refers to the small villages and hamlets that make up the north of the Southern Highlands and Wingecarribee Shire. All are north of Mittagong. Historically, many either are on the Old Hume Highway or the old Picton Loop Line. In the past they were referred to as the "Northern Towns". All of the Northern Villages made up the previous Mittagong (Nattai) Shire.
The postcode for the Northern Villages is the same as Mittagong: 2575. However, Balmoral has the postcode of 2571.
Villages.
The villages include:
History.
Hill Top, Colo Vale, Willow Vale, Balmoral as well as Braemar are located on the historical Picton Loop Line which used to be part of the Main Southern railway line but became a separate line in 1919 upon the building of a new alignment for the main line ( "see Southern Highlands railway line" ). The Loop line and stations are still intact. The northern section of the line is used by Thirmere's Railway Museum for the museum's antique steam trains, while the remainder of the line is now disused.
The new line that was opened in 1919 was built a few kilometres east into the villages of Yerrinbool, Alpine, Aylmerton and Balaclava. This line is still in use but Yerrinbool is the only Northern Village to retain an open railway station.
Braemar and its surrounding villages are also located on the historic Old Hume Highway along with Yerrinbool, Alpine and Aylmerton until the construction of the current Hume Highway in the 1980s.
National Parks.
Hill Top, Balmoral, Yerrinbool, Colo Vale and parts of Braemar are surrounded by the Nattai National Park and small reservations that make up the national park the Bargo State Conservation Area and Jellore State Forest.
Development.
The Northern Villages mostly serve as residential areas with small commercial businesses such as general stores. However, recently Braemar (because of its growth is now considered part of Mittagong) has grown commercially and industrially with businesses taking advantage of zoned areas in the North of Braemar. This is because Braemar is next to railway and is close to the Hume Highway and its ramps.

Agathon Léonard

Agathon Léonard or Léonard Agathon van Weydevelt (1841 Lille - 1923 Paris), was a French Art Nouveau sculptor. 
Belgian by birth, Léonard moved to Paris when quite young and studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris under Eugène Delaplanche. He became a member of the Société des Artistes Français in 1887 and a member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1897. He regularly exhibited across France, and was made a chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur in 1900. Some of his best-known works are studies of dancers, such as "La Cothurne" (Tragic Pose from Le Jeu d'escharpe), modeled in 1895 and cast in 1900. The "Play of the Scarf", executed in a characteristic fin-de-siècle manner and rendered in gilt, showed a dancer in a flowing gown with a billowing scarf held above her head. This piece was produced in 1897, was inspired by the renowned dancer, Lois Fuller and was displayed as a table centerpiece at the 1900 World's Fair at the "Pavillon de Sèvres" in Paris.
Bronze casting of Léonard's work was carried out by the Susse Frères Editeurs foundry. Besides bronze, he also produced works in marble, quartz and ivory. His bas-relief of St. Cecilia is to be found in the Abbeville Museum and the Nantes Museum houses a bust titled "The Plunderer of Shipwrecks".
Léonard also produced Art Nouveau medallions, statuettes and pottery.

Francisco del Paso y Troncoso

Francisco de Borja del Paso y Troncoso (October 8, 1842 in Veracruz, Veracruz Mexico – April 30, 1916 in Florence, Italy) was an important Mexican historian, archivist, and Nahuatl language scholar. 
He attended primary school in his hometown, and later moved to Mexico City. In his youth, he dedicated most of his time to commercial activities, but still found time to register in the National Preparatory School, attending as a regular student until he had successfully completed his studies. It is believed that he had among his teachers Don Gabino Barreda, and he had initially decided to pursue a career in medicine. Toward the end of his studies he wanted to prepare his thesis on the botany and ethno-pharmacology of the ancient Mexicans. His initial investigation in this field aroused his interest so much that he devoted himself to the study and research of the archaeological field, particularly to the inquiry of documentary sources from both Indian and Spanish authors of the 16th century. This change in studies was eventually at the cost of his not receiving his medical degree.
Del Paso y Troncoso soon came to focus the Nahuatl language, and his work came to be permanently linked to the National Archaeological Museum. In 1889 Del Paso y Troncoso was appointed director of that institution. During much of 1890 and 1891, he led a significant archaeological exploration of the state of Veracruz.
In 1892, at the commemoration of the 400th Anniversary of the discovery of the New World, Del Paso y Troncoso was nominated president of the Mexican Commission on the American Historic Exhibition to be held in Madrid. He kept his title as director of the National Archaeological Museum in Mexico, and traveled to Spain in August 1892. Del Paso y Troncoso was to remain in Europe until his death, working without rest in archives and libraries on the continent. 
During the nearly twenty-four years devoted to research and outside of Mexico, Del Paso y Troncoso arranged for publication a wealth of documents and unpublished works of the utmost importance for the history of Mexico. His extensive correspondence shows that were always in contact with cultural institutions and specialists in his country and others from abroad that were also interested in the same field of research. Utilizing materials found in the libraries, archives and collections of Mexico and Europe, Del Paso y Troncoso made significant contributions to the historiography of the Conquest-era and Colonial Mexico periods, identifying, collating and publishing a number of important historical source documents and original manuscripts.
Before 1884, Del Paso y Troncoso was elected Fellow of the Mexican Academy of Language. In 1893 he was appointed member of the Royal Academy of History and also the Spanish Association of Writers and Artists. In 1895 he was received as an honorary member of the Pontifical Roman Academy of Archaeology and as a correspondent of the Paris Societe des Americanist. In 1898 he also obtained a diploma of honorary membership of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. 
In the Anales del Museo Nacional de Arqueología he published "Ensayos sobre los símbolos cronológicos de los mexicanos", 1892; "Estudio sobre la historia de la medicina en México", 1896; "Lingüística de la República Mexicana", 1886; "Códice indiano del Sr. Sánchez Solís", 1888; "Los trabajos lingüísticos de don Miguel Trinidad Palma", 1897; "Notas arqueológicas y cronológicas al estudio de interpretación del Códice Borgiano hecho por José Lino Fábrega", 1899-1900; "Lista de los pueblos principales que pertenecieron a Texcoco", 1897; " Utilidad de la lengua mexicana en algunos estudios literarios", 1897; "División territorial de la Nueva España en el año de 1636", 1912; "Escritura pictórica, el códice Kingsborough", 1912.
A number of editions of major works on the history of Mexico appeared after his death, including the following titles: Historia y conquista espiritual de Yucatán, de fray Bernardo de Lizana, México, 1892; Biblioteca nahua, 6 v., Florencia, 1899-1909; Historia de las cosas de la Nueva España de fray Bernardino de Sahagún (Primeros memoriales, Códice matritense del Real Palacio y Códice de la Real Academia de la Historia, textos de los informantes de Sahagún), 3 v., Madrid, 1906-1907; Papeles de Nueva España, 7 v., Madrid-México, 1905; Códice Mendocino, México, 1925; Crónica de Nueva España, del doctor don Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, 3 v., Madrid-México, 1914-1936; Epistolario de la Nueva España, 16 v., México, 1939-1942. 
Some of his other contributions include: Los libros de Anáhuac, México, 1895; Comentario al Códice Borbónico, Florencia, 1905. 
The major biographical source, from which the majority of this article was derived, was written by Miguel León-Portilla, and published in: Semblanzas de Académicos of Academicians. Ediciones del Centenario de la Academia Mexicana. México, 1975.

Daniel Ryan Keatings (born 4 January 1990 in Kettering, England) is a British artistic gymnast. He trains at the Huntingdon Olympic Gymnastics Club under coach, Paul Hall alongside teammate Louis Smith.
Keatings has represented Scotland as the 2006 Commonwealth Games and Great Britain at both the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, 2009 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics
In April 2009, Keatings won the All-Around Silver Medal in the European Gymnastics Championships in Milan. He also won the Bronze Medal in the Pommel Horse final. In September 2009 Keatings gained a sponsorship deal with business power supplier Opus Energy. The company agreed to cover his competition fees, equipment, and travel costs. During the same year Daniel also became an official ambassador for premium sports nutrition brand Maximuscle.
On 15 October 2009, Daniel made history when he became the first British gymnast to win a medal in the All-Around event at the Artistic World Championships. The event, which was held at the O2 Arena in London, saw Keatings rise to the occasion and record a score of 88.925 taking the silver medal in front of the home crowd.
On 25 April 2010, Daniel made history again when he won Great Britain's first ever Senior European Championship Gold medal on the pommel horse the day after he helped Great Britain to win a historic silver medal in the team competition (their previous highest finish was 9th in 2008).
Returning from an injury, he made a comeback at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tokyo. He did not have a good competition in the preliminary rounds, including a fall off the Pommel Horse and a particularly nasty fall on high bar. He was not the only one of the British men's team to falter, and the team did not qualify through to the team final, finishing in 10th place and Keatings failed to qualify through to any of the individual event finals.
On 25 March 2012, Daniel competed at the Turnier der Meister FIG Challenge Cup C III Apparatus, Cottbus, Germany. After exceeding all expectations, Daniel reached the final and held his nerve, producing a quality routine that scored 15.775 for the silver medal, just over a tenth of a mark behind Olympic Champion, Xiao Qin of China.

Indigenous peoples in Ecuador

Indigenous peoples in Ecuador are the groups of people who were present in what became the South American nation of Ecuador when Europeans arrived. The term also includes their descendants from the time of the Spanish conquest to the present. Their history, which encompasses the last 11,000 years, reaches into the present; 25 percent of Ecuador's population is of indigenous heritage, while another 65 percent is of mixed indigenous and European heritage. Black people, people of Spanish descent, and others make up the remaining 10 percent.
Migration.
There are different theories about how the American continents became populated. The prevailing theory, the Land Bridge Theory, holds that the first inhabitants of Americas migrated from Asia across the Beringia. According to this theory, the first inhabitants of South America arrived from North America via the Panamanian isthmus.
Other theories hold that the first humans to reside in the Americas came across the Pacific Ocean from Oceania or across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe.
Archaeological periods.
While archaeologists have proposed different temporal models at different times, the schematic currently in use divides prehistoric Ecuador into five major time periods: Lithic, Archaic, Formative, Regional Development, and Integration. These time periods are determined by the cultural development of groups being studied, and are not directly linked to specific dates, e.g. through carbon dating.
The Lithic period encompasses the earliest stages of development, beginning with the culture that migrated into the American continents and continuing until the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene. The people of this culture are known as Paleo-Indians, and the end of their era is marked by the extinction of the megafauna they hunted.
The Archaic period is defined as "the stage of migratory hunting and gathering cultures continuing into the environmental conditions approximating those of the present." During this period, hunters began to subsist on a wider variety of smaller game and increased their gathering activities. They also began domesticating plants such as maize and squash, probably at "dooryard gardens." In the Andean highlands, this period lasted from 7000-3500 BP.
The Formative Period is characterized by "the presence of agriculture, or any other subsistence economy of comparable effectiveness, and by the successful integration of such an economy into well-established, sedentary village life." In Ecuador, this period is also marked by the establishment of trade networks and the spread of different styles of pottery. It began in about 3500 and ended around 2200 BP.
Regional Development is the period, dating roughly 2200–1300 BP, of the civilizations of the Sierra, described as "localized but interacting states with complex ideologies, symbol systems, and social forms." The people of this period practiced metallurgy, weaving, and ceramics.
The Integration Period (1450 BP—450 BP) "is characterized by great cultural uniformity, the development of urban centres, class-based social stratification, and intensive agriculture." The Integration Period ends and the historic era begins with the Inca conquest.
Paleo-Indians.
The oldest artifacts discovered in Ecuador are stone implements discovered at 32 Cotton Pre-ceramic (Paleolithic) archaeological sites in the Santa Elena Peninsula. They indicate a hunting and gathering economy, and date from the Late Pleistocene epoch, or about 11,000 years ago. These Paleo-Indians subsisted on the megafauna that inhabited the Americas at the time, which they hunted and processed with stone tools of their own manufacture.
Evidence of Paleoindian hunter-gatherer material culture in other parts of coastal Ecuador is isolated and scattered. Such artifacts have been found in the provinces of Carchi, Imbabura, Pichincha, Cotopaxi, Azuay, and Loja.
Despite the existence of these early coastal settlements, the majority of human settlement occurred in the Sierra (Andean) region, which was quickly populated. One such settlement, remains of which were found at the archaeological site El Inga, was centered at the eastern base of Mount Ilaló, where two basalt flows are located. Due to agricultural disturbances of archaeological remains, it has been difficult to establish a consistent timeline for this site. The oldest artifacts there discovered, however, date to 9,750 BP.
In the South, archaeological discoveries include stone artifacts and animal remains found in the Cave of Chobshi, located in the "cantón" of Sigsig, which date between 10,010 and 7,535 BP. Chobshi also provides evidence of the domestication of the dog. Another site, Cubilán, rests on the border between Azuay and Loja provinces. Scrapers, projectile points, and awls discovered there date between 9,060 and 9,100 BP, while vegetable remains are up to a thousand years older.
In the Oriente, human settlements have existed since at least 2450 BP. Settlements that probably date from this period have been found in the provinces of Napo, Pastaza, Sucumbíos, and Orellana. However, most of the evidence recovered in the Oriente suggest a date of settlement later than in the Sierra or the Coast.
Origins of agriculture.
The end of the Ice Age brought changes to the flora and fauna, which led to the extinction of the large game hunted by Paleo-Indians, such as giant sloth, mammoth, and other Pleistocene megafauna. Humans adapted to the new conditions by relying more heavily on farming. The adoption of agriculture as the primary mode of subsistence was gradual, taking up most of the Archaic period. It was accompanied by cultural changes in burial practices, art, and tools.
The first evidence of agriculture dates anywhere from the Preboreal Holocene (10,000 years ago) to the Atlantic Holocene (6,000 years ago).
Some of the first farmers in Ecuador were the Las Vegas culture of the Santa Elena Peninsula, who, in addition to making use of the abundant piscine resources, also contributed to the domestication of several beneficial plant species, including squash. They engaged in ritual burial and intensive gardening.
The Valdivia culture, an outgrowth of the Las Vegas culture, was an important early civilization. While archaeological finds in Brazil and elsewhere have supplanted those at Valdivia as the earliest-known ceramics in the Americas, the culture retains its importance due to its formative role in Amerindian civilization in South America, which is analogous to the role of the Olmeca in Mexico. Most of the ceramic shards from the Early Valdivia date to about 4,450 BP (although some may be from up to 6,250 BP), with artifacts from the later period of the civilization dating from about 3,750 BP. Ceramics were utilitarian, with the exception of small feminine figures referred to as "Venuses."
The Valdivia people farmed maize, a small bean (now rare) of the Canavalia family, cotton, and "achira", a water-plantain. Indirect evidence suggests that maté, coca, and manioc were also cultivated. They also consumed substantial amounts of fish. Archaeological evidence from the Late Valdivia shows a decline in life expectancy to approximately 21 years. This decline is attributed to an increase in infectious disease, accumulation of waste, water pollution, and a deterioration in diet, all of which are associated with agriculture itself.
In the Sierra, people cultivated locally-crops developed, including potatoes, quinoa, and tarwi. They also farmed crops that originated in the coastal regions and in the North, including "ají", peanuts, beans, and maize. Animal husbandry kept pace with agricultural development, with the domestication of the local animals llama, alpaca, and the guinea pig, as well as the coastal Muscovy Duck. The domestication of camelids during this period laid the basis for the pastoral tradition that continues to this day.
In the Oriente, evidence of maize cultivation discovered at Lake Ayauchi dates from 6250 BP. In Morona-Santiago province, evidence of Regional Development period culture was discovered at the Upano Valley sites of Faldas de Sangay, also known as the Sangay Complex or Huapula, as well as at other nearby sites. These people created ceramics, farmed, and hunted and gathered. They also built large earthen mounds, the smallest of which were used for agriculture or housing, and the largest of which had ceremonial functions. The hundreds of mounds spread over a twelve square kilometer area at Sangay demonstrate that the Oriente was capable of supporting large populations. The lack of evidence of kings or "principal" chiefs and also challenges the notion that cultural creations such as monuments require centralized authority.
Development of metallurgy.
The period from 2450 BP—1450 BP is known as the "Regional Development" period, and is marked by the development of metalworking skills. The artisans of La Tolita, an island in the estuary of the Santiago River, made alloys of platinum and gold, fashioning the material into miniatures and masks. The Jama-Coaque, Bahía, Guangala, and Jambalí also practiced metalwork in other areas of the Ecuadorian coast. These goods were traded though mercantile networks.
Pre-Inca era.
Prior to the invasion of the Inca, the indigenous societies of Ecuador had complex and diverse social, cultural, and economic systems. The ethnic groups of the central Sierra were generally more advanced in organizing farming and commercial activities, and the peoples of the Coast and the Oriente generally followed their lead, coming to specialize in processing local materials into goods for trade.
Coast.
The coastal peoples continued the traditions of their predecessors on the Santa Elena peninsula. They include the Machalilla, and later the Chorrera, who refined the ceramicism of the Valdivia culture.
Oriente.
The economy of the peoples of the Oriente was essentially silvicultural, although horticulture was practiced. They extracted dyes from the achiote plant for face paint, and curare poisons for blowgun darts from various other plants. Complex religious systems developed, many of which incorporated (or perhaps originated from) the use of hallucinogenic plants such as "Datura" and "Banisteriopsis". They also made coil ceramics.
Sierra.
In the Sierra, the most important groups were the Pasto, the Caras, the Panzaleo, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Palta. They lived on hillsides, terrace farming maize, quinoa, beans, potatoes and squash, and developed systems of irrigation. Their political organization was a dual system: one of chieftains, the other, a land-holding system called "curacazgo", that regulated the planting and harvesting of multiple cycles of crops. While some historians have referred to this system as the "Kingdom of Quito", it did not approach the level of political organization of the state.
Economy.
Using the system of multicyclic agriculture, which allowed them to have year-long harvests of a wide variety of crops by planting at a variety of altitudes and at different times, the Sierra people flourished. Generally, an ethnic group farmed the mountainside nearest to it. Cities began to specialize in the production of goods, agricultural and otherwise. For this reason, the dry valleys, where cotton, coca, "ají" (chili peppers), indigo, and fruits could be grown and where salt could be produced, gained economic importance. Sometimes, tribes farmed lands outside their immediate purview. These goods were then traded in a two-tiered market system.
Free commerce took place in markets called ""tianguez"", and was the means by which ordinary individuals fulfilled their need for tubers, maize, and cotton. Directed commerce, however, was undertaken by specialists called "mindala" under the auspices of a "curaca". They also exchanged goods at the "tianguez", but specialized in products that had ceremonial purposes, such as coca, salt, gold, and beads. Seashells were sometimes used as currency in places such as Pimampiro in the far North. Salt was used in other parts of the Sierra, and in other places where salt was abundant, such as Salinas.
In this manner, the Pasto and the Caras undertook their existence in the Chota Valley, the Puruhá in the Chanchán riverbasin, and the Panzaleos in the Patate and Guayallabamba valleys.
In the coastal lowlands, the Esmeralda, the Manta, the Huancavilca, and the Puná were the four major groups. They were seafarers, but also practiced agriculture and trade, both with each other and with peoples of the Sierra. The most important commodity they provided, however, were Spondylus shells, which was a symbol of fertility. In areas such as Guayas and Manabí, small beads called "chiquira" were used as currency.
Also following the lead of the Sierra peoples, the people of the Oriente began congregating around sites where cotton, coca, salt, and beads could be more easily produced for trade. "Tianguez" developed in the Amazon forest, and were visited by "mindala" from the Sierra.
Political organization.
The extended family, in which polygyny was common, was the basic unit of society. The extended family group is referred to by the Kichwa word ""ayllu"", although this type of organization predates the arrival of Quechua speakers. Two political systems were built on the basis of the "ayllu": the "curacazgo" and the "cacicazgo". Each "curacazgo" is made up of one or more "ayllu". The Ecuadorian "ayllus", unlike in the Southern Andes, were small, made up of only about 200 people, although the larger ones could reach up to 1,200 members. Each "ayllu" had its own authority, although each "curaca" also answered to a chief ("cacique"), who exercised power over the "curacazgo". The "cacique"'s power depended on his ability to mobilize manual labor, and was sustained by his ability to distribute highly-valued goods to the members of his "curaca".
Religion.
Local beliefs and practices co-existed those practiced regionally, which allowed each ethnic group to maintain its own religious identity while interacting, especially commercially, with neighboring groups. Some regional commonalities were the solar calendar, which marked the solstices and equinoxes, and veneration of the sun, moon, and maize.
Inca conquest.
The Inca empire expanded into what later became Ecuador during the reign of Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, who began the northward conquest in 1463. He gave his son Topa control of the army, and Topa conquered the Quitu and continued coastward. Upon arriving, he undertook a sea voyage to either the Galápagos or the Marquesas Islands. Upon his return, he was unable to subdue the people of Puná Island and the Guayas coast. His son Huayna Capac, however, was able to subsequently conquer these peoples, consolidating Ecuador into "Tawantinsuyu", the Inca Empire.
One of the Inca's tactics included uprooting groups of Quechua-speakers, called "mitmas", loyal to the empire and resettling them in areas that offered resistance.
Many tribes resisted the imperial encroachment, in particular the Cañari in the south, near modern-day Cuenca, and the Caras and the Quitu in the North. However, the Inca language and social structures came to predominate, particularly in the Sierra.
Some scholars dispute the Inca heritage of indigenous people of Ecuador.
Spanish conquest.
In 1534, at the time of the arrival of the first columns of Spanish conquistadores, the population of the present day territories of Ecuador is believed to border the figure of one million inhabitants. This might have been a result of epidemics of smallpox and diphtheria that spread in the Andes after the first contacts with Spanish explorers and their livestock. According to early Spanish chronicles the Inca Huayna Capac died of smallpox and then the territories of Collasuyo and central Peru so a period of civil war for the control of the royal household between two brothers each an heir to the dominions of their respective maternal feudal lands. 
Huáscar was a prince born to a noble family of Cuzco and Atahualpa was a son from a noble family of the Quitus. The quitus were a tribe that formed an alliance with the Incas during the conquest of Huayna Capac. Most important in this civil war was the participation of Huayna Capac generals on the side of Athaulpa's faction, probably due to the late sovereign wish.
Rubber boom.
The 19th century marked a time in history when the need for rubber came into high demand in the world. Many Western Territories including America wanted to produce Rubber Industries in desire to produce economic prosperity. They also expressed an alternative goal, which was to also make better the region they will be in partnership with by improving their land and their economic status as well.
Reasons as to why they decided to obtain partnership with the Amazonian region was for a couple a reasons. One of the reason being that the location was ideal. Two of the most high quality rubber trees grew in that region, the Hevea tree and the Castilloa. tree the Hevea tree was only able to be used 6 month out of the year while the Castilloa was able to be used the whole year. To begin the trading system, the Western territories began to obtain discourse with the Mestizos of the land which were know to be the more prestigious of the different groups residing in Ecuador. They became highly tied into the trading system that was created. There was fast money involved in this system that attracted the Mestizos. Economic prosperity seemed promising. As the rubber industry flourished many other factors came to surface in the system of Rubber production. Because of the high demand for rubber at the time, the Mestizos who became known as the Caucheros (rubber barons) decided that they needed to obtain an abundant amount of workers that would work for low wages. The indigenous population soon came to mind because of a couple of factors. One was due to the fact that they seemed the best fit to perform the labor. They knew the lands to which they would work on because of their long history of them living on the land. They were well adapted to the climate and was familiar with the means of survival like hunting and gathering. The enslavement of the Indigenous people soon became an epidemic. Natives were taken from their homes by a group called the Muchachos who were African men hired by the Caucheros to do their dirty work. They were in turn forced to work in the rubber industries by fear and intimidation and were put on a rubber quota in relation to a certain time period and were expected to meet the demands. 
If the requirements were not met they were punished. Punishments by the Muchachos were very severe and brutal. Common punishments including flogging, hanging, and being put into a cepo. When the workers were put into a cepo they were chained in pain inflicting positions and left without food and water for an extensive amount of time. More extreme punishments included the shooting of workers if they tried to escape or they became to ill to work. The pay for their hard labor was minimal. They were put on what was called a debt-penoage where they had to work for a long period of time in order to gain funds to pay back debt they owned to the Caucheros for supplies that were given to them for their daily tasks such as tools to work, clothes, and food. It most commonly lead them to work their whole life for the rubber barons due to the fact that very little money was compensated for their labor. They usually received a small item that they were able to keep such as a hammock, the rest was given straight to the employer. Government intervention was minimal to none because of bribery that lead local officials to overlook what was occurring and the fear of being attacked by the Indians. The end of the Rubber Boom was marked in 1920 when the prices of rubber diminished. The enslavement of the Indigenous people seized in association with this.
Modern times.
Population and demographics.
There is debate about the quantities of indigenous currently inhabiting Ecuador. Some elements of society, most famously the former President León Febres Cordero, have insisted that the indigenous make up no more than two million people. Historian Enrique Ayala Mora, too, estimates that the indigenous population is no more than sixteen percent. Other organizations, such as CONAIE, while giving varying estimates in different years, tend to approximate closer to four million. The discrepancy arises from the ways in which they are counted: "oes one consider them such on the basis of physical characteristics or whether they live in the Andean Indian world?"
Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. They are Quichua speakers and include the Caranqui, the Otavaleños, the Cayambi, the Pichincha, the Panzaleo, the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tungurahua, the Tugua, the Waranka, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Saraguro. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may be the descendents of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador in a mitma, or forced migration.
Coastal groups, including the Awá, Chachi, and the Tsáchila, make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Quichua (the Canelo and the Quijos), the Shuar, the Huaorani, the Siona–Secoya, the Cofán, and the Achuar.
Politics.
In 1986, indigenous people formed the first "truly" national political organization. The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) has been the primary political organization ever since, and has been influential in national politics, including the ouster of the presidents Abdalá Bucaram in 1997 and Jamil Mahuad in 2000.
In 1998, Ecuador signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization Convention 169.
Petroleum operations.
The year 1978 marked the beginning of petroleum production in Ecuador. Texaco is documented to be the primary international oil company that was given permission to export oil from the coast of Ecuador. This company managed the oil operation from 1971 to 1992. The Ecuadorian government along with Texaco began to scout the Oriente in a joint business known as a consortium. Major shipments of oil were put into action in 1972 after the Trans-Ecuadorian Pipeline was finished. In the years of production business in oil production increased rapidly and Ecuador soon became the second largest producer of oil in South America. Texaco made a notable contribution to the Ecuadorian economy with aiding in the production of 24.5 billion dollars that was given to the Ecuadorian government. The company also was said to provide about 800 employee jobs and 2,000 contract workers employment Texaco also aided in the production of roads, airports, schools and medical facilities. 
Texaco's contract for oil production in Ecuador expired in 1992. PetroEcuador then took over 100% of the oil production management. 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil was reported to have been extracted while under the management of Texaco. There were also reports of 19 billion gallons of waste that had been dumped into the natural environment with the absence of any monitoring or overseeing to prevent damages to the surrounding areas. In addition there was a report of 16.8 million gallons of crude that was dispersed into the environment in relation to spillage out of the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline.
In the early 1990s a lawsuit led by Ecuadorian government officials of 1.5 billion dollars was presented against the Texaco company with claims that there was an immense pollution epidemic that led to the demise of many natural environments as well as an increase in human illnesses. A cancer study was conducted in 1994 by the Centre for Economic and Social Rights which found a rise in health concerns in the Ecuadorian region. In 2002, it was found that there was a notably higher incidence of cancer in women and men in the countries where there was oil production present for over 20 years. Women also reported increased rates in a copious amount of psychical aliments such as skin mycosis, sore throat, headaches and gastritis. The primary argument against these findings were that they were weak and biased. Texaco decided on jurisdiction in Ecuador. The case put against Texaco remained in the works for some time. In 2001, Texaco was taken over by Chevron, another oil company, which assumed the liabilities left by the previous production. On February, 2011 Chevron was found guilty after inheriting the case left by Texaco and was said to be required to pay 9 billion dollars in damages. This is known to be one the largest environmental lawsuits award recorded.

The 1st Rogerstone Scout Band was formed in 1957 by Ramon O'brien, who continued, as bandmaster, until his death in January 2012. Ramon played with the Newport District Scout Band and continued to play in both until Newport District Scout band ceased to exist. It is a 'Group Band' however it has members from all over the Newport Scout District. The band was formed quite by chance, as someone offered Ramon some second hand drums they no longer had the space for, and the band was born. The band has included members that have gone onto play for The Parachute Regiments Corps of Drums. It has played a major part in Rogerstone's Remembrance Day Parade as well as Newport District's annual St George's Day Parade. In February 2012, Gavin Foley and Jonathan Gibbons took over the band as Band Master and Assistant Band master, and have subsequently added new music and instruments, to the existing line up. In the summer of 2012, Andy Watson joined the leadership team as Director of Music

Jan Koźmian

Jan Koźmian (1812–1877) was a Polish literary figure, and a Roman Catholic priest after the death of his wife. 
He founded and wrote for upwards of twenty years in the "Posen Review". He and his brother Stanislaus Kozmian were the first secular workers for the revival of Catholic convictions in Poland. They both took part in the Polish insurrection of 1831, and subsequently went into exile. Jan lived in France, before returning to Posen.
Works.
His articles have been collected in three volumes (1881). The programme of the "Review" stated "That she may fulfil her mission, Poland must be united to the Church". Noteworthy are "The Two Idolatries", on Revolutionism and Panslavism, and his last essay, "Duties are permanent." 
He also wrote about Italian affairs and in favor of the temporal power of the Papacy. In a controversial essay he attacked the Jesuit Ivan Gagarin, who maintained that the great obstacle to the conversion of the Russians was that they identified Catholicism and Poland.

Breynia oblongifolia

Breynia oblongifolia, commonly known as coffee bush, grows naturally in Australia and New Guinea as shrubs up to in height. The species produces alternate, ovate leaves long. Small, green flowers are produced in spring and summer, and these are followed by orange or pink berries about diameter that turn black when fully ripe.
This native shrub may be confused with "Senna" species which are found in similar similar habitats. The species may be distinguished from Sennas and may be distinguished by the alternate leaves of "B. oblongifolia" contrasting with the opposite leaves (leaves facing each other in pair, or technically leaflets) of "Senna" species. Sennas also produce conspicuous yellow flowers followed by leguminous pods in contrast to the inconspicuous flowers and red berries of "B. oblongifolia".

She performed to capacity audiences in Nashville and New York in 2005 and has established herself as a nationally acclaimed performer in South Africa.
Verity has been internationally recognized for innovation in the music industry and has been featured in various news sources in South Africa and around the world, including Carte Blanche, Africa's premier news reporting show. Verity launched the 'Lucky Packet Project' which is an initiative to generate funding for her records, independently of assistance from record labels, as well as to create investment for upcoming artists in South Africa.
Verity is the first musician in South Africa to sell her CD's before the CD's existed. Verity's web team developed a transaction facility on her website. 'Future Owners' bought enough of her CD's for Verity to fund the production of her album. Over 2000 people in 25 countries bought the CD, without guarantee of their investment being realized. 10.6% of every sale was given to two South African charities (POWA empowering women and the Live Your Dreams Foundation funding up and coming artists) and by the time the album was recorded over R30,000 had been contributed.
Verity is the first artist in South Africa to achieve a self-funded project of this nature. Verity has bucked the trend of signing up to a major record label and is the first person in South Africa to do this.
Verity's album, named “Journey” by her fans, was recorded with award winning producers Paul McIver & Brian O'Shea and was released in July 2008. The story has been broadcast as Virtual Verity on M-NET's Carte Blanche, SABC3's The Power Within and more recently SABC3's Journey to the Core.
Verity plays regularly with her band Verity and the Shades around South Africa and is reputedly currently working on another album.

Turn the World Around

Turn the World Around is an album by Harry Belafonte, released in 1977.
After 21 years on the RCA Victor label, Belafonte signed with Columbia Records. After a series of Pop-oriented albums, "Turn the World Around" was a return to interpreting folk songs of other cultures. Gary Ginell stated in his Allmusic review: "It is an absolute triumph and one of the finest albums of his career." Although recorded in the US, it was only released overseas.
The title track became the focus of one of the most acclaimed performances on the successful television series, "The Muppet Show", where Belafonte explained the artistic theme of the song before performing it with specially designed puppets that resembled African tribal masks. Series producer Jim Henson considered this production to be his best work on the series, and featured it in numerous retrospectives of his art; Belafonte performed the song again at Henson's memorial service.

Trams in Turku

The Turku tramway network was the first—and as of 2008, second to last—tram system to be operated in Finland. It was operated as horse tramway from 1890 until 1892, and as an electrified tramway from 1908 until 1972. Prior to 1919 the tram system was owned by private interests, and from that year onwards by the City of Turku until closure of the system.
The possible recreation of the tram network and/or a creation of a light rail network have been discussed since the (second) closure of the tram system in 1972. In December 2009 the Turku City Council made the decision that a light rail system (, "fast tramway") system would be realised in the city after an intermediate phase of bus rapid transit.
History.
1890–1892: Horse tramway.
In 1889 Spårvägsaktiebolaget i Åbo ("Tramway Company in Turku"), led by Count August Armfelt applied for the right to construct a horse-drawn tram line in Turku. The application was positively received in the city council, and already on 4 May 1890 the company opened a tram line between Turku Castle and the city centre. This was the first tram system in Finland, then an autonomous part of Russia. Unusually for a tramway system in Finland, the line was built with a track gauge of , instead of the Russian broad gauge standard of or the gauge used on all subsequent Finnish tramways. Although passenger numbers were relatively high, high maintenance costs led to the horse tramway being unprofitable, and it was closed down already on 31 October 1892. The five tramcars owned by Spårvägsaktiebolaget i Åbo were sold to Stockholms Nya Spårvägsaktiebolag, Sweden in 1894.
1908–1919: Privately owned electric tramway.
Due to the city's population increase, the idea of building a tramway in Turku resurfaced during the first years of the 20th century. Building an electrically powered tramway for the city was first proposed in 1905, but due to the lack of local experience in constructing such a system, foreign companies were selected to construct the service. Germany-based AEG, who also owned the electricity plant in Turku, eventually reached an agreement with the city for building a tram network and operating it for forty years, the city having an option to buy the operations after ten years and thereon between five-year intervals.
The new tram network was built to the used on the Helsinki tram network, and it was opened on 22 December 1908. From the start the new network was much more extensive than the horse tram network, with two lines initially operated; a circular line in the centre of the city and a harbour line connecting the city centre to the Port of Turku. In 1909 the two lines were combined into a single one—this rather complex route arrangement was retained until 1932. The first-generation of electric trams in Turku were built by the Swedish ASEA. The new traffic form gained high popularity, and passenger numbers grew steadily until the beginning of World War I.
During World War I the Grand Duke of Finland (aka Tsar Nicholas II of Russia) ordered all German-owned possessions within Finland to be confiscated. Therefore between 18 August 1914 and 15 June 1918 the Turku tramway was under control of the Turku and Pori County under the name Turun Sähkölaitos. The war resulted in unprecedented growth in passenger numbers, to the extent that there was not enough capacity to carry all potential passengers. Following the end of the war and the subsequent Finnish independence, control of the tramway was returned to Electricitätswerk Åbo AG. However, already on 15 April 1919 the City of Turku purchased the highly profitable tram operations for itself.
1919–1943: Expansion.
In 1920, soon after the city took over the tram operations, an explosion at the electric plant resulted in the death of seven people, as well as large-scale damage to the plant itself. As a result the distribution of electricity was disturbed, and the tram network was inoperative due to lack of power for 87 days. Plans were made during the earlier half of the 1920s for expansion of the tram network, but the poor post-war financial situation meant these could not be realised.
The first privately owned bus lines appeared in Turku in 1923. During the rest of the decade the number of bus lines grew, resulting in dropping passenger numbers for the tram system. By the end of the decade the tram system was operating at a loss. A committee was set in 1931 to investigate the future of city-maintained public transport in Turku, which recommended that the tram network be expanded and the city should not, for the time being, start its own bus operations. Following the committee's recommendations, plans were drawn to convert the entire tram network to double track and expand it to various directions, doubling the track lineage. This also meant the creation of three separate lines. The construction of the expansions started in 1932, when two new extensions of the network were opened, resulting in the creation of three separate lines. A fourth line is also said to have existed at some point during the first half of the 1930s, but reports about it are fragmentary and conflicting. Further expansions to the network were built during 1933 and 1934. The expansion of the tram network resulted in higher passenger numbers, which necessitated the acquisition of new rolling stock. Prior to acquisition of the new trams a poll was held amongst tram passengers to decide the colour of the new trams. The traditional yellow colour won the vote, scoring 724 votes against the second favourite, dark blue with 208 votes. To cover for a temporary shortage of rolling stock before new trams were delivered, five trams were rented from Helsinki during the years 1931-1938.
Further expansion of the network occurred in 1938 and 1940. The 1940 expansion resulted in the combination of lines 2 and 3 into a single line, which changed numbers halfway though the route. The two-designation system was necessitated by the fact that the new 2/3 line spooled back into itself, with the end of the line stop for "line 3" being located along the route of "line 2". Tram operations continued throughout World War II, with passenger numbers greatly exceeding those during peace-time.
1944–1959: Decline.
While the war still continued, new trams were built for Turku in 1944. Following the end of the war passenger numbers started declining rapidly, which meant the tram operations were making loss by the end of the decade. In 1950 an experiment was carried out to give up having separate conductors in trams and have the driver sell tickets in order to cut costs. Although the city transport department was pleased with the experiment, it was terminated within the same year partially due to pressure from the tram staff. During the same year the city decided to start its own bus operations. Despite this the city continued to be committed to the tram operations, and during the early 1950s the rail lineage was improved and new trams were acquired. In 1951 lines 2 and 3 were split, resulting in the creation of a circular line 3.
As the 1950s progressed the general opinion started turning against tram traffic, following the general trend of the time. The termination of tram traffic by 1980 was first proposed in 1952 by architect Olavi Laisaari of the city planning department in a proposal for general guidelines for city planning. The proposal was at the time rejected. In 1954 a committee led by vice-city executive Öyvind Stadius came to the conclusion that trams were an impractical solution for a city of Turku's size, but nevertheless recommended maintaining the tram network as large investment were made to it. During the 1950s and 60s the decisions for the future of the tram network were largely a struggle between Laisaari and Stadius for termination of tram traffic on one side, and the leader of the traffic department Pentti Savolainen (Stadius' subordinate) for development of tram traffic on the other side. Despite the statements against the tram network, the city traffic department made large-scale plans for expansion of the tram network during the 1950s, including light rail lines connecting Turku with neighbouring cities Raisio and Kaarina, which would have greatly increased the profitability of the tram system. Unfortunately these were not realised, apart from a short expansion of line 2 completed in 1956 with a light rail -type track entirely separated from street traffic. Also in 1956 the traffic department acquired new RM 2 -type four-axle trams. Although the city had decided not to build the proposed light rail lines, these so-called "ghost cars" were designed to be usable on light rail lines.
During the latter part of the 50s passenger numbers started declining again, and a committee formed in 1959 found that under the current financial circumstances the expansion of the tram network was impossible to realise. However, the committee also stated the expansion of the network was necessary in the long run, and the needs of light rail lines should be taken into account in city planning. Additionally the committee suggested, again, ceasing the usage of conductors in trams in favour of ticket-selling by the driver in order to cut costs. By this time the city decision-makers were uninterested in developing or even maintaining the tram network, and as a result the committee's recommendations were not acted on.
1960–1972: Termination.
By the beginning of the 1960s it was clear that the tram network could become profitable again only if it was expanded to the more lucrative suburban routes dominated by the private bus operators. Additionally most of the rolling stock dated from before or during the World War II, and were nearing the end of their lifespan, which meant that sizeable investment would be needed to keep the trams operational. In 1961 the traffic department proposed the acquisitions of new four-axle trams, but the proposal was left untreated by the technical committee until the traffic department would make a proposal for the future of the tram system. As a result Pentti Savolainen proposed the gradual closure of the tram system by 1980, synchronising the closure of different lines with the retirement of the then-current tram staff. Six new four-axle trams would have been required for this plan to be realised. No actual reason was given why the tram system should be closed.
Savolainen's closure plan was eagerly accepted by the technical committee and forwarded to the city council. The council however turned down the proposal. At the same time the requests for funds for even the most basic maintenance of the tram network were also turned down. Subsequently Savolainen submitted a proposal for termination of tram traffic by 1972, as continuing traffic after that time was not viable without some investment in track maintenance and the rolling stock. However, earlier closure would not be possible due to the need to find new jobs for the tram staff. Additionally the closure of the tram system would require investment in 75–80 diesel-powered buses. None of the preceding or subsequent proposals for replacement of the tram system with buses included an objective comparison between the expenses of tram and bus operations. Each proposal simply presumed that buses were cheaper, without looking further into the matter.
Starting from 1962, several committees were formed to plan the termination of tram traffic, most of which simply followed Savolainen's second termination proposal. At the same time the future of city-maintained public transport was a source of conflict in the city council, where the rightist parties wanted to leave public transport entirely for private operators, while the leftist parties wanted the city to continue operating public transport lines with buses. Even though the city council on the whole agreed that tram traffic should be terminated, it wasn't until 1965 that the decision was made to terminate line 1 on 11 March 1967, due to the "life-threatening" condition of its tracks. No decision was made about the future of other lines however.
Following the termination of line 1 in 1967, two additional committees was set to investigate the future of the city's public transport department, but neither arrived at any new conclusions. In 1969 the decision was made to terminate traffic on line 3 in 1970, but due to delays in delivering the new buses and other difficulties, in the end only line 3A (the inner circle on circular line 3) was terminated, a year behind schedule on 24 April 1971. During the same year the decision was made to convert line 2 into bus traffic in 1972 and line 3B in 1973. Traffic on line 2 ended on 31 May 1972 and finally line 3B (the outer circle on line 3) was closed ahead of schedule on 1 October 1972. During the last day of operations all trams in traffic were full with passengers wishing to give their farewells – some even decorated the trams with flowers. The last tram—carrying nearly two hundred passengers although certified for only 50—departed from the terminus stop on 23:30 Eastern European Time, and completed its circle at 23:54, marking the end of tram service in Turku.
Although the conversion into bus traffic was believed to be an answer to making the city-operated public transport system profitable again, this was not in fact the case and the operations continued making even larger losses until the city's public transport system was reorganised in the 1990s. The termination of tram traffic also led to a drop in passenger numbers on the city-operated public transport network, despite the growth of the city that took place at the same time.
Rolling stock.
Apart from the last tram type acquired in 1956, the trams used in Turku had no official type designations, possibly owing to the uniformity of the rolling stock.
Possible future rail systems.
The closure of the Turku tram system has been subsequently widely regarded as a mistake. The recreation of a rail-based public transport system in the city, either in the form of another tram system or a light rail one, has been discussed since the closure of the previous tram system in 1972. The Turku city council approved the future construction of a light rail system on 15 December 2009. In the interim the city's public transport system will be rearranged as a bus rapid transport system.
Light rail.
The possibility of creating a light rail system into Turku and the neighbouring cities has been discussed since the 1990s. On 4 December 2000 the Turku municipal executive committee ordered a preliminary study to be made about the possible construction of a light rail system in the city, replacing the most popular bus connections that are already running at maximal capacity. The study was completed in 2002. This study recommended the creation of a light rail system with a track gauge of to facilitate the usage of train tracks in parts of the system. Two main lines were proposed in the study, one with the route Naantali–Raisio–Turku–Kaarina and another with the route Runosmäki–Turku city center–Varissuo. The cost of the proposed system was at the time of the study's completion projected at over €320 million.
In 2008 the city of Turku ordered a more detailed study to be made about the way public transport systems are developed in the City Region of Turku in the future, comparing light rail- and bus-based alternatives. The goal is to present a solution for the creation of an efficient, attractive and uniform public transport system for Turku and the neighbouring cities. An intermediary report for this study was completed in December 2008, which recommended a somewhat different light rail system from the 2002 study. In the 2008 study the line to Naantali was abandoned but a more extensive network within central Turku was proposed, including the recreation of tracks that had been used by the old Turku tram system.
The 2008 report recommended for the construction of the light rail network to take place in two phases: phase 1 would be completed by 2020 and would include the lines Runosmäki–Majakkaranta (in Korppolaismäki) and Varissuo–Turku Central railway station. The total length of these lines would be . Phase 2 would be completed after 2020, coinciding with new residential development in Raisio and Kaarina, and would include a third line Kaarina–central Turku–Raisio and an extension of the Varissuo–Central railway station to the Port of Turku. Total length of the system following phase 2 would be . As the new proposal does not feature any running on train tracks, rail gauges of , and were presented as alternatives. No preference was given to any of the listed gauges, although the benefits of the standard gauge were stated to be the highest of the three alternatives.
The final report on the recommended future development of public transport in Turku was delivered in April 2009. Based on this report, the city council of Turku decided on 15 December 2009 that in the short run the city's public transport system would be rearranged to allow the establishment of a bus rapid transport. In the long run the usage of trolleybuses will be studied, while the most heavily trafficked core bus lines are to be converted into light rail lines.
Museum tramway.
The creation of a museum tramway utilising the remaining trams in the possession of the City of Turku was first proposed in 1985, and has since then been the subject of debate in the city.

Legal threat

A legal threat is a statement by a party that it intends to take legal action on another party, generally accompanied by a demand that the other party take an action demanded by the first party or refrain from taking or continuing actions objected to by the demanding party.
Nature.
Legal threats take many forms. Common to all is that the party making the threat will take some form of action of a legal nature. Most common is the threatened initiation of a lawsuit against the second party. Other threats might include an administrative law action or complaint, referring the other party to a regulatory body, turning the party into the legal authorities over a crime or civil infraction, or the like. Legal threats are often veiled or indirect, e.g. a threat that a party "shall be forced to consider its legal options" or "will refer the matter to legal counsel."
Types.
Cease-and-desist.
A cease and desist (C&D) letter is a formalized legal demand that a party stop ("cease") and refrain ("desist") from an activity that the demanding party finds objectionable, generally couched in formal language accusing the activity of violating the law. 
The objected-to activity may be most anything, although cease-and-desist letters are particularly common among certain areas of the law:
Demand letter.
A "demand letter" is a formalized demand by a party that another party pay money or take certain acts, often accompanied by a claim that the second party has engaged in illegal conduct, with an implicit or explicit threat that the demanding party will take some form of legal action
Effect of legal threat.
For the most part a legal threat is of no legal significance other than a matter of negotiation tactics; however, in certain instances a legal threat does have some legal significance. Among other things a legal threat may do the following:
In addition to their legal significance, legal threats may create a number of practical results:

Ivan Gagarin

Ivan Sergeyevich Gagarin (born in Moscow, 1 August 1814; died in Paris, 19 July 1882) was a Russian Jesuit, known also as "Jean-Xavier" after his conversion to Catholicism. He was of the princely Russian family which traces its origin to the ancient rulers of Starodub.
Life.
He was the son of the Russian state-councillor, Prince Sergius Gagarin, and Barbara Pushkin. He entered the service of the state at an early age, and was first named attaché to his uncle, Prince Gregory Gagarin, at Munich, on whose death, in 1837, he acted as secretary to the legation at Vienna. He was afterwards transferred to the Russian embassy at Paris, where his services were requisitioned in a similar capacity. 
He frequented the salon of his near relation, Madame Sophie Swetchine, and was on terms of familiar intercourse with Father de Ravignan, Lacordaire's successor in the pulpit of Notre-Dame de Paris. 
His conversion to Catholicism took place in 1842. On 19 April of that year Gagarin made his profession of faith, and was received into the Catholic Church by Ravignan. According to Russian law, this put an end to his diplomatic career, and he forfeited all rights to his inheritance. 
In the latter half of 1843 he entered the Society of Jesus, and passed his novitiate at Saint-Acheul. He was afterwards sent to Brugelette (in Belgium) where the French Jesuits in exile had a High School. He then taught church history and philosophy, at the College of Vaugirard and the school of Ste-Geneviève, and at Laval. He spent some time in Versailles and, in 1855, was back at Paris. From this time onwards he wrote extensively in the Catholic cause.
When the religious orders were expelled from France, Gagarin went to Switzerland, but soon returned to Paris, where he died.
Works.
Gagarin's literary output was considerable; many of his articles which appeared in current reviews and periodicals were afterwards collected and published in book form.
As a polemist Gagarin was thorough, and his work as a religious propagandist was of importance. His main object was win over Russia to the Catholic Church. In conjunction with Fr. Daniel, Gagarin founded (1856) the journal "Etudes de théologie, de philosophie et d'histoire" (merged into "Etudes religieuses, historiques et littéraires", 1862); he established the "Œuvre de Prop. des Sts. Cyrille et Méthode" (1858), to promote corporate union amongst the Churches; and contributed to the "Contemporain", "Univers", "Ami de la Religion", "Précis historiques", "Correspondant", "Revue des questions historiques", etc.
The "Polybiblion" (Paris, 1882), another review in which articles appeared from the pen of Gagarin, exhibits (XXXV, 166-188) a long list of his writings. These include: 
Gagarin also spent several years in Constantinople, where he founded the Society of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, which aimed at reuniting the Greek and Latin Churches. With this object, too, he published: 
studies on the Oriental Churches. Amongst works of Gagarin's later years are: 
Almost all the above were published at Paris. A portion of his works were re-issued by Brühl, in "Russische Studien zur Theologie und Geschichte" (Münster, 1857); and by Huttler, in "Katholike Studien" (Augsburg, 1865).

Volkswagen Transporter (T5)

The Volkswagen Transporter T5 range is the fifth generation of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles (VWCV/VWN) medium-sized light commercial vehicle and people mover Caravelle/Multivan range. It was launched 6 October 2002, and went into full production in 25 April 2003, replacing the fourth generation T4 Transporter range.
Key markets for the T5 range are Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and Turkey. The U.S. market does not receive the Transporter T5 range due to it being classed as a light truck, which thereby automatically includes a 25% extra tax (known as the chicken tax) on importation into the US. The passenger vans were the worst selling vans in the North American market in 2003, when VW North America sold the last Eurovans in the United States.
Overview.
The Transporter is the commercial workhorse in the T5 range, available in over 100 combinations. Variants include short- (SWB), or long-wheelbases (LWB); along with low-, medium-, or high-rooflines; and can be configured as a van, minibus, single-cab, double-cab, drop side or chassis truck.
Body types.
A brief view of the Transporter T5 range:
Apart from these factory variants there are a multitude of third-party conversions available, some of which are offered through the VWCV/VWN dealer organisation. They include refrigerated vans, ambulances, police vans, fire engines, ladder trucks and so on.
The full cargo payload potential of the Transporter is between to 1.4 tonnes. Load compartment volumes range from to .
In Mexico, the Transporter T5 range is marketed under the North American Eurovan nameplate.
People movers.
The T5 is also available in six- to eleven-seat configurations called Shuttle, Kombi, Caravelle, and Multivan.
Variants.
Sportline.
The Transporter Sportline is the range-topping trim level of the Transporter panel and Kombi van. It comes as standard with a Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine, generating torque of at 2,000 rpm, and is mated to a six-speed manual gearbox.The 2.5 5 cylinder models where blighted with problematic water pumps which were later redesigned as the original plastic impellers fell to bits. A recall of the Toureg pumps was not extended to the commercial van range. Boost hose from the turbo were also problematic with the hose clip failing. Power steering pumps were another weakness failing, some dealers whilst changing the power assist pump could also damage the air conditioning system whilst under taking the power assist pump replacement.
DMF (dual mass flywheels) clutch system caused problem for owners although appears to have improved from earlier model around 05-06. A simple test is to park nose down on a gentle slope, engage reverse and see if the clutch operation results in juddering, if so the vehicle will require attention.
Side door handles were modified but not recalled where they rubbed on the paint where they passed through the body damaging the paint and causing blistering and corrosion (dealer bulletin issued) which VW refused to cover under their corrosion warranty sold with their vehicles. The PD engines can have problems with camshaft wear from the pump operation and the correct grade of engine oil is essential to minimize wear. Problem with central locking in vans can usually be traced to poor electrical connections below the drivers seat.
Reports of a "Clonk" sound in steering columns was a fault which baffled VW aftersales teams and remained on some vehicles for a long time.
The vans whilst quick and nippy can be hard on tires with maybe on 18,000 miles on the front tires. Issues reported of Michelin Aquila's tires forming eggs in the tread not easily seen from the side and cracking in the base of the groves.
The vehicles have a wide range of options including an acoustic cabin option which make the van feel more like a car. Air conditioning with climate control, although dealers do not seem to change the pollen filters without prompting.
Other standard features on the Sportline include 18-inch weight-rated alloy wheels, body-coloured bumpers, door mirrors and handles. It features suspension which is lowered by over standard variants, and has chrome side bars and grille, a roof spoiler, as well as a special Volkswagen badge.
The Sportline featured in an episode of Top Gear TV series; where Clarkson, Hammond and May had to choose three vans to compete in a series of challenges, including transporting equipment for The Who. Jeremy Clarkson claimed the Sportline to be "the fastest van in Britain".
This claim was put to the test by competitor TV programme "Fifth Gear" where the Sportline has been put head to head with The A-Team van, as well as the Mercedes-Benz Vito Sport-X. The Sportline comfortably won a race against the A-Team GMC van, even with Tiff Needell cutting corners and using short cuts in the vein of the television series. Against the Sport-X, even though the Mercedes had a more powerful engine, it was found that the traction control was too sensitive and overtly intrusive to be able to make quick progress around a track.
California.
The California (Kombi) Beach and California are Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles T5-based in-house designed and built motorhome range.
The range compiling of the entry California Beach comes with just a fold-up bed, whereas the California is a fully equipped camper with beds, sink, and fold-up seat and tables.
Facelift.
In September 2009, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles launched a revamped and facelifted T5 range, which is sold under four main labels the Transporter, Caravelle, Multivan and California.
The revised range showcases new technology to blight the van range of a poorly design EGR valve which failed regularly, dealers claimed it was their best earner. The medium van segment, which includes a world-first with the dual clutch transmission named Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) – which is also available with 4motion four-wheel drive, Side Lane Assist for monitoring blind spots when changing lanes, tyre pressure monitor display for monitoring tyre pressures (TMPS), Bi-Xenon Head Lights with LED Daytime Running Lights and touchscreen Radio Navigation System (RNS) and a reversing camera that worked in conjunction with RNS.
Engines powering the revised range are now all inline-four-cylinder designs; and all are 2.0 L in cubic capacity which includes one petrol option, and four newly developed high-efficiency Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel options, all with common rail, replacing the former Pumpe Düse (PD) Unit Injector fuel system. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles claim that this new diesel engine range is twenty percent more efficient than the outgoing TDI range.
Edition 25 Multivan (2011).
It is a version commemorating 25th anniversary of Multivan, covering 2.0L petrol, 2.0L TSI (150 kW), 2.0L TSI 4MOTION (150 kW), 2.0L TDI (75 kW), 2.0L TDI (103 kW), 2.0L TDI 4MOTION (103 kW), 2.0L BiTDI (132 kW), 2.0L BiTDI 4MOTION (132 kW) models. It includes a matte black roof and black 18-inch alloy wheels, black door handles, matte black paint on the underside of the front bumper, black decal trim at the back and side sills; choice of Candy White, Salsa Red or Metallic Silver body colour; sport chassis and upgraded anti-roll bar.

Naqada culture

The Naqada culture is an archaeological culture of Chalcolithic Predynastic Egypt (ca. 4400–3000 BC), named for the town of Naqada, Qena Governorate.
Its final phase, Naqada III is coterminous with the so-called Protodynastic Period of Ancient Egypt (Early Bronze Age, 3200–3000 BC).
Chronology.
William Flinders Petrie.
The Naqada period was first divided by the British Egyptologist William Flinders Petrie, who explored the site in 1894, into three sub-periods:
Werner Kaiser.
Petrie's chronology was superseded by that of Werner Kaiser in 1957. Kaiser's chronology began c. 4000 BC, but the modern version begins slightly earlier, as follows:
Monuments and excavations.
Predynastic Egyptians in the Naqada I period traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean to the east. They also imported obsidian from Ethiopia to shape blades and other objects from flakes. Charcoal samples found in the tombs of Nekhen, which were dated to the Naqada I and II periods, have been identified as cedar from Lebanon.

The Conspiracy of the "Maharlikas", also referred to as the Revolt of the Lakans or the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587–1588 was a plot against Spanish colonial rule by the Tagalog and Kapampangan noblemen, or "Datus", of Manila and some towns of Bulacan and Pampanga, in the Philippines. They were the indigenous rulers of their area or an area yet upon submission to the might of the Spanish was relegated as mere collector of tributes or at best Encomenderos that need to report to a Spanish Governor. They are always awaiting for an opportunity to revolt. It was led by Agustín de Legazpi, the son of a Maginoo of Tondo (one of the chieftains of Tondo), born of a Spanish mother given a Hispanized name to appease the colonizers, grandson of conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi, nephew of Lakan Dula, and his first cousin, Martin Pangan. The datus swore to rise up in arms. The uprising failed when they were betrayed to the Spanish authorities by Antonio Surabao (Susabau) of Calamianes.
Rebels.
The mastermind of the plot was Agustín de Legazpi; the mestizo grandson of conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi, nephew of Lakan Dula, a relative of Rajah Matanda. Being a Moro, he is the son-in-law of Sultan Bolkieh of Brunei; whose first cousin was Martin Pangan, the "gobernadorcillo" of Tundun.
Besides the two, the other leaders were Magat Salamat, son of Lakan Dula and the crown-prince of Tondo; Juan Banal, another Tondo prince and Salámat’s brother-in-law; Geronimo Basi and Gabriel Tuambacar, brothers of Agustín de Legazpi; Pedro Balingit, the lord of Pandakan; Felipe Salonga, the lord of Polo; Dionisio Capolo (Kapulong), the lord of Kandaba and brother of Felipe Salonga; Juan Basi, the lord of Tagig; Esteban Taes (Tasi), the lord of Bulakan; Felipe Salalila, the lord of Misil; Agustín Manuguit, son of Felipe Salalila; Luis Amanicaloa, another prince of Tondo; Felipe Amarlangagui, the commander-and-chief of Karanglan; Omaghicon, the Minister of Nabotas, and Pitongatan (Pitong Gatang), another prince of Tondo.
The cause of conspiracy was the continuous injustice committed by the Spanish Encomenderos against the people of the Kingdom (Sultanate) and their lack of respect to treaty obligations with the local aristocracy, which reserved them the right to still exercise nominal suzerainty over their vanquished kingdom, being vassal kings of the king of Spain but still, the Generals of Conquistador Legaspi refused to listen. This eventually forced the remaining Royalty, not killed, to secretly plot the colonizers overthrow.
Allies from Japan and Brunei.
The mestizo, Augustín de Legazpi and a group of conspiring Rajahs had contacted the Japanese captain, Juan Gayo, through a Japanese Christian interpreter, Dionisio Fernández, who had also joined the conspiracy. A secret meeting ended with an agreement in which Gayo would supply arms and warriors to help in the rebellion and recognize De Legazpi as king of the entire Philippines. In return, Gayo and his men would receive half of the tribute to be collected from the Philippines. A significant group of merchants known only as the "Sakai Merchants", with their leader Luzon Sukezaemon, had also been known to conspirate with the royal families against Spanish rule.
Apart from the Japanese, there were other secret arrangements that needed to be accomplished before the final plan of the uprising could be completed. First, a secret delegation would travel to Borneo to secure troops and ships from the Sultan of Brunei. Second, there was the need to obtain the support and participation of the Datus of La Laguna and Komintang in the struggle for freedom. Once a full commitment was received from Brunei, Komintang and Laguna, the armed rebellion would begin upon the arrival in Manila Bay of the Sultan of Brunei’s warships with warriors on board. The conspirators and their armed warriors would then launch a ferocious attack to completely annihilate the Spaniards and then set the city on fire.
Traitor.
On the way to meet with the Sultan of Brunei, Magat Salámat, Juan Banál, and Augustín Manuguit stopped at Cuyo, Calamianes, to meet with its chief, Datu Sumaclob. The datu was swayed to join the conspiracy and pledged to contribute 2,000 of his men for the cause. However, Salámat made an error in judgement by recruiting another Cuyo native, Antonio Surabao (Susabao). Upon learning of the secret plan, Surabao rushed to expose it to his master, Captain Pedro Sarmiento, the Spanish "encomiendero" of Calamianes. Once Salámat, Banál and Manuguit were apprehended, Sarmiento hastily traveled to Manila on October 26, 1588 and informed Governor-General Santiago de Vera of a brewing conspiracy against Spanish rule.
Arrests and Punishment.
Governor-General De Vera immediately ordered the arrest of all the rebels. Tried and found guilty of treason, Augustín de Legazpi and Martin Pangan were hanged, their heads cut off and exposed on the gibbet in iron cages. Their properties were seized by the Spanish authorities and their lands plowed and sown with salt so that they would remain barren. Dionisio Fernández was hanged and his property confiscated. Dionisio Capolo (Kapulong), the lord of Candaba, Pampanga, was exiled from his town and paid a heavy fine. De Vera eventually pardoned him. Later, he served as a guide and interpreter for two Spanish expeditions into Igorot country in 1591 and 1594.
The other five leading members were exiled to Mexico — Pedro Balinguit (lord of Pandacan), Pitongatan (a prince of Tondo), Felipe Salonga (lord of Polo), Calao (a commander-in-chief of Tondo), and Agustín Manuguit (Minister of Tondo). They were the very first natives of the Philippines to settle in Mexico.

St. Josaphat's Roman Catholic Church

St. Josaphat's Roman Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church located at 715 East Canfield Street in Detroit, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1985. It is one of three churches that make up Mother of Divine Mercy parish.
History.
In 1889, the Polish community of St. Albertus Roman Catholic Church was outgrowing the capacity of the church, and the parish of St. Josaphat was started on June first to serve the burgeoning community. The church is named after St. Josaphat Kuntsevych, a Greek Catholic priest, who became archbishop of Polotsk, Poland in 1617. He was martyred in 1623 and canonized in 1867, thus it is likely that this parish, founded only 22 years later, was among the first to bear his name.
The church was located on Canfield not far west of the Sweetest Heart Of Mary Roman Catholic Church. It is possible that the choice of location was intended to compete with Sweetest Heart, which was at the time a Polish Catholic church unsanctioned by the diocese. On February 2, 1890, parishoners dedicated the first building of St. Josaphat, a combination church and school. However, in the next decade, the church grew to over 1,000 families under the leadership of Father Razadkowski. In response, Razadkowski raised funds to build the current church. The structure opened in 1901, along with a rectory and janitor’s home. A school was built in the 1920s.
By 1960, the Polish community that had once attended the church had scattered to the suburbs. The school was closed and demolished, and St. Josaphat struggled with dwindling membership and the upkeep of the aging church. However, the parish began a building rehabilitation program, and it continues to serve the Polish community.
In 2004, St. Josaphat became the home for the Archdiocese of Detroit's first regular celebrations of the Tridentine Latin Mass since the liturgical reforms following the Second Vatican Council. Attendance at weekend Masses has significantly increased as people from all over southeastern Michigan travel to St. Josaphat for this liturgy. St. Josaphat has also developed a choir and music program to accompany the Tridentine Mass. Since Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 widened permission for the 1962 form to be used as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, St. Josaphat has added weekday and Holy Day Masses and special events for its Latin Mass Community. 
Architecture.
The Victorian Romanesque Revival and Gothic Revival style church was designed by Joseph G. Kastler and William E. N. Hunter. It was built by the Jermolowicz Brothers and local carpenters, Harcus and Lang. The church measures by , with a ceiling and a seating capacity of 1200. The main steeple is tall, while the two side steeples are each 100 feet. The exterior of the church is built from red and orange brick, extensively trimmed with Bedford Indiana buff limestone. The stained glass windows, depicting Mary & Joseph and the twelve apostles, were made by the Detroit Stained Glass Works.
The interior of the church contains five altars. On the main altar there is a painting of St. Josaphat, dressed in the vestments of an eastern rite bishop. The side altars are dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph, and in the transept of the church are altars dedicated to Saints Anthony of Padua and Francis of Assisi. The woodwork in the church is crafted of white oak, and there is an extensive collection of murals on the walls.
Current information.
The church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and received historic recognition from the city of Detroit in 1983, and as a Michigan State Historic Site from the state of Michigan in 1985.
On June 19, 2013, a decree from his excellency Allen H. Vigneron, Archbishop of Detroit, created the the new Mother of Divine Mercy parish from the clustered parishes of St. Josaphat, Sweetest Heart of Mary and St. Joseph.
Effective July 1, 2013, Fr. Gregory Tokarski became new pastor of the parish.
In November 2013, the main spire suffered structural damage during a winter storm. Because the congregation did not have the funds to make necessary repairs, it announced on November 19, 2013 that the spire would be demolished and replaced with a small roof.

In 2006 the village had a population of 2700.
Jews in Osieciny.
After the First World War there were 450 Jews in the village. In Osieciny were Jewish social aid institutions and branches of the Zionist parties and Agudat Israel. The Germans occupied Osieciny in September 1939. Community Judenrat was established and its main role was to provide forced workers. A ghetto was established in 1940 in the village. In April 1942, the Jews were gathered in the church and from there they were sent to Chelmno extermination camp.
Extensive documentation of Jewish life before the Holocaust in Osieciny is in a book by Rafael Olewski - "The Tear" , 1983, Tel-Aviv. Rafael Olewski was born in Osieciny in 1914, and his uncle was the last rabbi of the Jewish community.
The synagogue is still standing, neglected and used by a commercial company. Beit HaMidrash is standing next to him and is used for other purposes. "Jewish Street" changed his name. The Rabbi house is occupied by non-Jewish residents of the town, as well as other houses of Jews. Jewish cemetery was desecrated by the Nazis, and tombstones were stolen by the Poles after the Holocaust and became stone pavement. The Cemetery now is occupied by a private person, and when telephone technicians dug there, bones and skulls were uncovered at a depth of only 30 cm... Beyond that there is no sign, monument or other memorial means for the Jewish ex-residents of the town. They faded and disappeared. The Municipality does nothing to perpetuate the memory, and learn a lesson from what happened in the town.

When used on a digital EOS body with a field of view compensation factor of 1.3x, such as the Canon EOS-1D Mark III, it provides a narrow field of view, equivalent to a 36–390mm lens mounted on a 35mm frame body. With a 1.6x body such as the Canon EOS 400D, it provides a narrower field of view, equivalent to a 45–480mm lens mounted on a 35mm frame body.
This lens has a push-pull type zoom mechanism and can be used for many types of photography, because of its large focal length range. It is used mostly for press photography, and also for travel photography.

Richard Stover

Richard Stover, Ph.D.,
Chief Technical Officer - Energy Recovery Inc.,
Born December 15, 1962 in Ravenna, Ohio
Raised in Glen Ellyn, Illinois
Richard Stover is one of the individuals who perfected the PX-220 energy recovery device that is currently in use in some of the largest seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in existence today.
Biography.
Richard Stover studied chemical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 through 1986. He graduated with bachelor’s degree and worked for 3M Company in Minnesota from 1986 through 1990 as a process and chemical engineer. He was responsible for product delivery, reliability, and cost at a videotape manufacturing facility.
Dr. Stover is one of those persons who hates to travel. He rode 10,000 miles on a bicycle in Southern Europe in the years 1990 and 1991.
He continued the study of chemical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley starting in 1991, completing a Ph.D. in 1996. His dissertation was entitled "Bubble Dynamics in Electrolytic Gas Evolution” (Electrochemical Engineering) with Charles Tobias and Morton Denn. As part of his work he devised an optical-laser technique to record fluid dynamics during hydrolysis and experimented with surface tension, viscosity, electrode polarity, and bubble size. He simulated experiments with a finite-difference fluid-flow model.
Dr. Stover worked for the IBM Corporation in San Jose from 1996 through 1998 as a process development engineer. There he led a manufacturing engineering team in developing and implementing a process for reducing friction and contamination in advanced computer hard drives. He discovered, demonstrated, and patented a hard-drive component design feature to increase product reliability.
He then worked for LFR Levine Fricke in Emeryville California 1998 through 2002 as a chemical engineering and environmental consultant. In this capacity, he designed and implemented wastewater treatment plants using chemical, electrolytic or membrane separation processes.
Dr. Stover finally joined Energy Recovery Inc.(ERI) in 2002 to develop and launch the PX-220, which has since become the leading energy recovery device in seawater desalination. His numerous publications and achievements have earned him international recognition as an expert in energy recovery and process optimization in reverse osmosis systems. At ERI, he holds responsibility for technical product-support services, strategic positioning of PX technology, and managing and expanding ERI’s intellectual property holdings. In addition, in his current role as Vice President of Sales, he is responsible for strategic growth and risk management. Dr. Stover was a co-recipient of the European Desalination Society’s 2006 Sidney Loeb award for outstanding innovation.
He has been married since 1996 and has two children.

The Rookie (web series)

The Rookie, formerly known as The Rookie: CTU in its first two seasons, is an exclusive series of webisodes made in 2007 and 2008, released over the internet, following the life of Jason Blaine, a new CTU agent. The series is a spin-off from the TV series "24".
The series is made close to the style of "24", in that it uses many of the same devices. For example, at the beginning of each "Day" there is a voiceover of Jason Blaine telling the viewer what time the series takes place between. Also, at the beginning of each episode, there is a "Previously on "The Rookie"" section, again with a voice over by Jason Blaine. The splitscreen is incorporated into the episodes often (at least once) to show phone conversations as well as to wrap up each episode. However, it does not take place in real time.
Episodes.
Day 1: Coffee Run.
"Coffee Run" is the first season of "The Rookie". It premiered on January 15, 2007, the day after 24: Season 6 premiered on Fox in the United States. It introduced Jason Blaine, a new rookie agent working at CTU Los Angeles, striving to get in some field work. There were three episodes made, each being released weekly.
In the series, Jason was sent to collect coffee for members of CTU whilst a briefing was being held. Whilst at the coffee shop he noticed some robbers entering a bank and decided to intervene. Going in a back entrance, he took the gun of a disarmed security guard and shot several of the robbers. At the same time, a co-worker from CTU called a SWAT team who entered the bank and dealt with the rest of the robbers. Jason arrived back at CTU with the now-cold coffees, much to his boss, Alton Maxwell's, displeasure.
Day 2: Mistaken Identity.
"Mistaken Identity", sometimes known as "Get This to ...", is the second season of "The Rookie". It premiered on March 26, 2007, the day after 24: Day 6 8:00pm–9:00pm premiered on FOX in the United States. It followed the further tribulations of Jason Blaine. There were three episodes made, each being released weekly.
Jason Blaine, yearning for more field experience, agreed to take a PDA out in the deserts of Los Angeles to his boss and Deputy Director of CTU Los Angeles Alton Maxwell. Whilst traveling, he received a call intended for his boss, informing him of a terrorist threat against a Russian Ambassador who Maxwell was planning to meet. Jason managed to stop the terrorists before they could attack the Ambassador, and once again to Maxwell's displeasure, Jason arrived late.
Day 3: Extraction.
"Extraction" is the third season of "The Rookie". It premiered on March 17, 2008, just under a year from when the last season premiered. It concluded on April 21, 2008. Six episodes were made, double the amount of the last two seasons. A new episode was released weekly.
"Extraction" followed the further adventures of Jason Blaine, now a more advanced field agent working for the FBI after the closure of CTU. His boss, Alton Maxwell was captured, and Jason strived to save him from the evil hands of drug kingpin Esteban Salazar, brother to the villains of the third season of "24".

Utah State Route 52

State Route 52 (SR-52) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting I-15 with US-189 along Orem's 800 North.
The road became a state highway in 1923, and was numbered as a spur of SR-7 in 1927 before being assigned its own number (52). The west end was at US-89 until 1959, when it was extended to I-15; a further extension took it to SR-114 in 1964.
Route description.
SR-52 begins at SR-114 in western Orem, across from the former Geneva Steel Plant, which was on the shore of Utah Lake. For its entire length, SR-52 gradually ascends through the Utah Valley along 800 North, ending at US-189 where the valley gives way to the Wasatch Range and that highway enters Provo Canyon. A mid-1980s flyover takes traffic directly from SR-52 onto US-189 north in the canyon.
SR-52 is in the National Highway System as a connection between I-15 and US-189. A project to widen about half the length of the road through Orem from four to six lanes was completed in October 2008.
History.
The road from SR-1 (US-91, now US-89) in Orem east to SR-7 (now US-189) at the mouth of Provo Canyon became a state highway in 1923. It was numbered as a spur of SR-7 in 1927, but in 1931 it was split off as State Route 52. In order to serve the planned Interstate 15, SR-52 was extended west to that road in 1959, and in 1964 the extension was continued to SR-114 (simultaneously with a similar extension of SR-265).
Major intersections.
The entire route is in Orem, Utah County.

2001 FA Charity Shield

The 2001 FA Charity Shield was the 79th FA Charity Shield, a football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions. The match was played on 12 August 2001 between 2000–01 Premier League champions Manchester United and 2000–01 FA Cup winners Liverpool. The match ended 2–1 to Liverpool, the fourth of five trophies they would win in 2001.
New Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy scored a consolation goal on his debut - the first of 150 goals he would score for the club in all competitions, in a five-year spell which averaged at 23 goals per season. Liverpool midfielder Gary McAllister, in his 37th year, became one of the oldest goalscorers in a Charity Shield when he successfully converted a second minute penalty.
The game was marred by a series of hooligan incidents occurring near the stadium. It was being played the day before a Cardiff City game; a group of Cardiff City fans entered the Prince of Wales public house in the city to find it occupied by Manchester United fans staying in the city overnight. A series of running battles between fans of the two clubs followed, resulting in 22 arrests (including two boys aged just 11 and 13) as well as a man suffering stab wounds and a police officer suffering a broken arm. On the day of the game, an army of around 50 Cardiff and Liverpool hooligans were seen attacking United supporters in the Wood Street area.

Nekodamashi

Nekodamashi requires there to be a fair amount of space between the wrestlers at the tachiai. Using the technique is also a gamble: if it miscarries, it leaves the wrestler wide open to his opponent's attack.
Nekodamashi is not listed as a kimarite (winning technique); even in the unlikely situation that a wrestler is so surprised by a nekodamashi that he falls over, the winning technique is simply recorded as hiwaza (non-technique victory.)
Famous sumo wrestlers to have used the nekodamashi over the years include Mainoumi, Otsukasa and Ozeki (champion-ranked) Mienoumi.

Bounce Streetdance Company

Bounce Streetdance Company is a dance company from Sweden that started 1997. Members include Alvaro Aguilera, Joe Jobe, Ambra Succi, Fredrik Rydman aka Benke, Filmon Michael, David Dalmo and Jennie Widegren. Many of the members has choreographed for "So You Think You Can Dance (Scandinavia)", and Fredrik "Benke" Rydman was permanent judge. The company recently staged a street dance tribute to Michael Jackson's "Beat It", which subsequently became a runaway YouTube success.
Lately they have been touring with their latest creation, "Insane in the Brain", a streetdance version of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", named after Cypress Hill's featured song, "Insane in the Brain".
Now they are working on their final production as a group "The Last Bounce" at Ericsson Globe Arena in Stockholm.
History.
In the late 1997 Bounce was formed by some of Sweden’s best streetdancers. The members of the group have been coming and going but the present dancers are Alvaro Aguilera, Ambra Succi, David Dalmo, Filmon “Fille” Michael, Fredrik “Benke” Rydman, Joe Jobe and Jennie Widegren. They have inspired each other with many different dance styles, Breaking, Locking, Popping, Boogaloo, New School, Jazz, Lindy Hop and Tap. Today they are ready to use any style of dance to create new and surprising shows.
When Bounce started to practise together they knew pretty soon that they wanted to do something more. At first they thought that they wouldn’t stay together for very long so they wanted to do a show before summer 2007. At that time they didn’t know that Bounce would last for seven years.
In 1998 Bounce's first show premiered and was called Rot. Right after that they toured in Sweden with the production Asfalt. At that time they needed something different after working hard for a long time. They went to Los Angeles to work and practice. In the summer 1999 the show Rotmos, inspired by L.A, was performed in an outdoor arena in the center of Stockholm.
Bounce was invited to tour with the Riksteater and Freaky Flow was created for the spring of 2000. During the practice of Freaky Flow the English producer Nick Grace contacted them and they came to an agreement for a new show to be created for Stockholm and London. The new show was called Bounce The Show and one of the words greatest lighting designers, Patrick Woodroffe, was working with them. On this show they really went for it and added 7 more dancers to perform with them.
Bounce came back to Sweden to do 24 sold-out shows at Dansens Hus after being in London for two months and then went back for another 10 weeks at the Roundhouse. During the London period Filmon Michael replaced Joe Jobe after he had badly injured his knee, and in the late autumn 2002 Filmon became a full member of Bounce Streetdance Company.
Bounce vs Petter was the next production and started in winter 2001/2002. It was the first time a dancegroup and a recording artist worked together to make a theatrical experience. On outdoor stages they toured around Sweden with 10 performances during the summer 2002 with a great show at Skansen as an end in front of 5000 screaming people.
For six months in 2003 Bounce collected their best dance- and visual ideas to shape the new show The Score and its storyline. This was the biggest dance show ever in Sweden and was about seven criminals coming together to do a heist, chased by the cop (danced by Lil'Tim, UK). Even in Norway and Denmark The Score was shown. Almost 100.000 audiences came to watch 116 shows in Scandinavia.
Bounce Live was a two years project with live musician led by André Ferrari and a story about Bounce and personally told stories. The musician passion and attitude help them to create the air of warm and soul that Bounce was looking for to share with the audience. The show was performed on the music hall Nalen. This has given a great experience to perform so close to the audience. They did 46 shows in the spring after the premiere in January 2005 and then toured around in Sweden in the fall.
In 2005 the TV-show Floorfiller aired with Bounce as judges and choreographers. At the same time they started to prepare for the new show "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest". Before the show people had wondering how it would be possible to tell this story with dance. This had been the most challenging they ever had created. But the audiences had understood the story through pure hiphop. The danceshow had almost as many shows as The Score and was rewarded with SvD Opera-Prize.
In 2008 Bounce continued to perform with "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" or another name for it "Insane in the Brain" in Sweden and in the UK. When they were back in Sweden they took some time away from each other to get new energy and collect new fresh ideas. Back together the group stated to plan their next show Caution with live barking dogs and crazy stunt, inspired by De La Guarda, to push their limits and challenge them. Caution had premier in February 2009 at the Orion Theatre and played at full houses for four months. When Caution ended they held their annually Bounce Summercamp where people from all over the world joined for three weeks.
Bounce made a Flash Mob in tribute to Michael Jackson in the summer 2009 that got over 8 million hits on YouTube. Just a little while after the first one they ended Bounce Summercamp with another Flash Mob who was called the Human domino with the dancer from the camp on the amusement park Gröna Lund.
In September they returned to London to once again do "Insane in the Brain" at the Peacock Theater with a followed with a UK tour. Totally more than 125 000 people have seen the show until now and a new UK-tour is planned in June 2010 at the Peacock Theatre.
On April 23, 2010 Bounce last dance show has premier at the Ericsson Globe and is called The Last Bounce. The show is going to contain some of the highlight from Bounce early shows mixed with new numbers with over hundred guestdancers.
On May 14, Fredrik Rydman and Jennie Widegrens choreography will appear at the opening segment of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö.
Former members: Karl Dyall, Sandra Meneses, Karim Rahali Carlsson,

Qu Bo (novelist)

Qu Bo 曲波(1923–2002) was a novelist in the People’s Republic of China. His name was also translated as Chu Po. Qu 曲, the family name, has meanings of curve, melody and tune. Bo 波 stands for ripples and waves. His first book "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" :zh:林海雪原 (pronunciation : lin hai xue yuan) made him one of the most popular authors at the time.
Life.
Born in Zaolinzhuang Village 枣林庄, Huangxian 黄县(now Longkou 龙口市]), at the north-east coast of Shandong Province 山东省, Qu Bo’s early education was through a private school where he started to gain his sound knowledge of Chinese classical literature and succinct language skills. His father, Qu Chunyang 曲春阳 and mother, Qu Liushi 曲刘氏 owned a small business of cotton dyeing, which failed when western textiles poured into China.
In 1938, at the age of 15, he left home and fought in the war against the Japanese invasion (Second Sino-Japanese War). His name was changed from his childhood name Qu Qingtao 曲清涛 into Qu Bo by the officials of the Eighth Route Army. Qu Bo had further education at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Shandong and became a journalist of an army newspaper, The Progress. The army turned into the People's Liberation Army after the Japanese surrendered, and Qu Bo continued to battle in the Chinese civil war in the northeast of China, protecting the regional civilians from robbery and killings by the regional bandits and brigands. In the army, he served as a young literacy teacher, a political commissar and finally a colonel. In 1946 he married Liu Bo 刘波 who was a head nurse of a hospital at the same army regional headquarters.
During the communist regime after 1949, Qu Bo worked in the railway industry and the Ministry of Machinery until his retirement, and lived in Beijing for the rest of his life.
Qu Bo was an active member of the Chinese Writers’ Association 中国作家协会, and was recognised as a Chinese contemporary writer in the history of Chinese Literature. He had, however, never stopped his full time industrial management jobs and only wrote books and articles during his spare time. He visited Russia, Pakistan and England as an author as well as industrial director. His novels were made into films, Beijing Opera musicals and TV shows.

Novels.
Tracks in the Snowy Forest 林海雪原 (1957), People’s Literature Publishing House 人民文学出版社. His major success, a thrilling tale of a small group of selected soldiers who went into the snowy mountains searching and fighting dangerous hidden bandits and brigands.

Gungahlin Community Council

The Gungahlin Community Council (GCC) is a voluntary, not for profit, community-based association operating in the Gungahlin District of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). This area covers the north-northwest of the ACT between the ACT/New South Wales border, the Barton Highway to the south, and the Federal Highway/Northbourne Avenue to the east, including the village of Hall. GCC’s stated objective is “To preserve and improve the social, cultural, economic and environmental well-being of Gungahlin and the Gungahlin community.”
The GCC operates an active community news website and distributes a bimonthly newsletter called Gungahlin Smokesignals – GunSmoke – which is delivered to all residents and businesses in the Gungahlin district, in excess of 15,000 copies.
Although the GCC is called a council, it is not a local government body, unlike councils in other parts of Australia. (The ACT only has two levels of government, whereas other parts of Australia have three – Federal, State and Local.)

Jean Gamans

Jean Gamans (born 8 July 1606, at Ahrweiler (according to other sources at Neuenahr, about two miles from Ahrweiler; there does not appear to exist any documentary evidence to show that he was born at the little town of Eupen, as stated in the "Bibliothèque des écrivains de la Compagnie de Jésus"); d. at the College of Aschaffenburg near Frankfurt, 25 November 1684) was a German Jesuit hagiographer.
Life.
He entered the Society of Jesus at Trier on 24 April 1623, having studied the humanities for five years and philosophy for two years at Cologne, where he had received the degree of Master of Arts. After making his novitiate, he devoted several months to a revision of his philosophical studies, and subsequently, from 1626, spent five years teaching in the college of Würzburg, conducting his pupils through the five classes which comprised the complete course in humanities. 
He then studied theology for a year at Mainz (1631), after which, the houses of his province of the Upper Rhine being suppressed during the intervention by Sweden in the Thirty Years' War, he continued his theological studies for three years at Douai, where he was ordained priest on 26 March 1633. These studies having come to an end in 1634, he discharged for several years the duties of chaplain to the land and naval troops in Belgium and Germany. We find him mentioned under this title (Castrensis) in the catalogue of the Flandro-Belgian province for 1641 as being attached to the professed house at Antwerp, where he made his profession of the four vows on 26 December of the same year. 
He lived here with the first two Bollandists, Jean Bolland and Godefroid Henschen. He became an active collaborator. He was then at Baden-Baden, where he resided for some time in order to direct the studies of the young princes of the House of Baden. He was undoubtedly there in 1641, and 1649. At the end of this latter year he resided in a missionary capacity at Ettlingen near Karlsruhe. Here we lose all sight of him until 1681, when he was attached to the College of Aschaffenburg near Frankfort, where he died 25 November 1684.
Works.
For more than thirty years, it is stated in the death notice inserted in the Annual letters of the College of Aschaffenburg for that year, he was so immersed in the hagiographical researches which he had undertaken in behalf of his associates at Antwerp that he devoted to them even the hours of the night, taking only a short rest on the floor or a strip of matting. His name occurs often in the "Acta Sanctorum" at the head of documents transcribed by his hand, and of commentaries written entirely by him (cf. "Bibl. des écriv. de la C. de J", sv. "Gamans"). 
A large number of surviving papers of this description were in the manuscript collection of the early Bollandists preserved at the Royal Library of Brussels and in the modern Bollandist library. Most of his papers, dispatched to the Bollandists after his death, were in fact lost when the vessel bearing them sank in the Main River. Gamans had also collected a mass of material for a "Metropolis Moguntina", which he wished to compose on the model of the "Metropolis Salisburgensis" published by Hund in 1582, and also for a history of the grand ducal House of Baden. As many as eight manuscripts of the latter work are known to exist.

Mike Graham (journalist)

Michael Graham (born 9 August 1960, Hampstead, London) is a British journalist. He is best known for his work as a presenter on national commercial speech radio station Talksport. Previously he was Editor of the Scottish Daily Mirror and Programme Director and mid-morning presenter of the Independent Republic of Mike Graham on Talk 107, the Edinburgh sister station of Talksport.
Early life.
He was born in London to Scottish parents Archibald and Marie Graham. He, however, has a pronounced North London accent.
Career.
Newspapers.
Before his career in broadcasting Mike was a Fleet Street journalist working for all the major newspaper groups including the "Express", "Times", "Mail" and News Group newspapers (News International) and Mirror Group. He covered wars, elections, trials and showbiz events during his time as a reporter. He was based in New York City from 1984–92, where he ran his own news agency supplying news, features and pictures to media all over the world.
He has presented radio shows for BBC Radio Scotland covering the Edinburgh Festival and the world of politics. Among the politicians and showbiz stars he has interviewed are Bill Clinton, Paul Newman, John Major, Tony Blair, Racquel Welch, Boris Yeltsin, George Michael, Alex Salmond, Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver.
Graham also appears regularly as a guest on Good Morning Scotland, Radio 5 Live, STV's the 5.30 Show with Stephen Jardine, Newsnight and The Lesley Riddoch Show. He is also a regular guest on Battle Line, a Washington-based US show on Radio America presented by Alan Nathan.
Radio.
He can now be heard on the UK national radio station, Talksport. He was first heard standing in on Talksport for Jon Gaunt in July 2008. Then he presented three shows every weekend, Saturday, Sunday and Monday Mornings from 1:00am–6:00am which was highly popular with regular callers. In April 2010 he presented the 10pm-1am slot every Friday and Saturday night, replacing George Galloway as well as continuing to present the Monday 1-6am slot. From July 2010 he moved from weekends to weekdays and then presented alongside Mike Parry between 10am-1pm replacing Andy Townsend, who left the station because he no longer wanted to commute from his Midlands home to the London studio.
Graham's future with Talksport seemed uncertain after his co-host Mike Parry resigned from Talksport as a result of a contractual dispute, but in March 2011 Mike returned to Talksport's overnight slot, this time covering Tuesday to Friday mornings 1.00am to 6.00am.

Tlatelolco (Mexico City)

Tlatelolco (, or "," from "tlalli" land; "telolli" hill; "co" place; literally translated "In the little hill of land") is an area in the Cuauhtémoc borough of Mexico City, centered on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, a square surrounded on three sides by an excavated Aztec archaeological site, a 17th-century church called Templo de Santiago, a former convent, and office complexes that used to belong to the Ministry of foreign relations and now are property of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
Historical events of modern Tlatelolco.
The Nonoalco-Tlatelolco housing project, built in the 1960s, is served by Metro Tlatelolco. It is also home to the pyramid-shaped Banobras building, which houses a 47-bell carillon. At 125 meters, this is the world's tallest carillon tower. There is also a building covered with white marble that is the former home of the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SRE).
In 1967, the Treaty of Tlatelolco signed here, with the aim of establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Since then, all the region's countries have signed and ratified the treaty.
On October 2, 1968, ten days before the start of the 1968 Summer Olympics the plaza was the scene of the Tlatelolco massacre, in which more than 300 student protesters were killed by the army and police.
On September 19, 1985, many housing buildings were destroyed or suffered damages due to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. One structure, the "Nuevo León" building, became a symbol of the Mexican people's solidarity during the disaster, represented by a small square in the spot where the building collapsed. Among the many others, Plácido Domingo labored there to help to rescue survivors, mainly because his family lived there.

Tlatelolco (archaeological site)

Tlatelolco is an archaeological excavation site in Mexico City, Mexico where remains of the pre-Columbian city-state of the same name have been found. It is centered on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, a square surrounded on three sides by an excavated Aztec site, a seventeenth-century church called the Templo de Santiago, and the modern office complex formerly of the Mexican Foreign Ministry and since 2005 of the "Centro Cultural Universitario" of UNAM.
The main temple of Tlatelolco, one of the excavated buildings recently saw the discovery of a pyramid inside the visible temple which is more than 700 years old. This indicates that the site is older than previously thought, according to Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History; INAH). Because it has design features similar to pyramids found in Tenayuca and Tenochtitlan, it may prove to be the first mixed Aztec and Tlatelolca construction found.
Discovery of mass grave.
On 10 February 2009, INAH archaeologists announced the discovery of a mass grave containing forty-nine human skeletons, laid out in neat lines on their backs, with their arms crossed and wrapped in maguey leaves. The archaeologists located the skeletons in a 13-by-32-foot (four-by-10-meter) burial site as they took part in a search for a palace complex at the Tlatelolco site. 
The remains found include those of forty-five young adults, two children, a teenager, and an elderly person wearing a ring that potentially signifies a higher status. Most of the young men were tall and several had broken bones that had healed, characteristics of warriors. At least 50 further bodies are expected to be located in the future. The grave contained both evidences of Aztec rituals such as offerings of incense and animal sacrifice, as well as Spanish elements such as buttons and a bit of glass.
Salvador Guilliem, head of the site for the governmental archaeology institute, expressed his astonishment at the find: "We were completely taken by surprise. We didn't expect to find this massive funeral complex". According to him, it was likely that the indigenous people buried in the grave died while fighting the invading Spanish or were killed by diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever epidemic, responsible for wiping out a large proportion of the native population in 1545 and 1576. The site differs from most other Spanish conquest-era graves in the area, because of the manner in which the bodies were buried. The burial was similar to Christian customs of the time, as opposed to the thousands of graves found in other Aztec cities where bodies were thrown in without care. Guilliem added: "It is a mass grave, but they were very carefully buried." Susan Gillespie of the University of Florida suggested an alternative theory that the men could have been held prisoners by the Spanish for some time and executed later.

Mitsubishi i-MiEV

The Mitsubishi i-MiEV (MiEV is an acronym for "Mitsubishi innovative Electric Vehicle") is a five-door hatchback electric car produced by Mitsubishi Motors, and is the electric version of the Mitsubishi i. The i-MiEV is also sold in Europe rebadged by PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) as the Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero.
The i-MiEV was launched for fleet customers in Japan in July 2009, and on April 1, 2010, for the wider public. International sales to Asia, Australia and Europe started in 2010, with further markers in 2011 including Central and South America. Fleet and retail customer deliveries in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2011. The American-only version, called "i", is larger than the Japanese version and has several additional features.
According to the manufacturer, the i-MiEV all-electric range is on the Japanese test cycle. The range for the 2012 model year American version is on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA) cycle. In November 2011 the Mitsubishi i ranked first in EPA’s 2012 Annual Fuel Economy Guide, and became the most fuel efficient EPA certified vehicle in the U.S. for all fuels ever, until it was surpassed by the Honda Fit EV in June 2012.
, more than 28,000 i-MiEV family vehicles have been sold worldwide. Japan is the leading market with 9,402 i-MiEVs sold through December 2013, followed by France with 4,455 units, Norway with 4,241 units, Germany with 2,307 units of the i-MiEV family registered through December 2013, and the United States with 1,697 i-MiEVs sold through December 2013.
History.
Mitsubishi i-MiEV, based on the Mitsubishi i kei car, was first exhibited at the 22nd International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium & Exposition in Yokohama. Mitsubishi eschews the in-wheel motors (MIEV) in favour of a more conventional array of batteries, motor and inverter to replace the "rear midship" engine and fuel tank of the conventional car. Mitsubishi Motors provided three power companies with vehicles in 2006 and 2007 in order to conduct joint research to evaluate how fast-charge infrastructure may be developed for EVs. Fleet testing by five power companies was conducted in 2007. The car had a range of for the 16 kW•h lithium-ion pack and for the 20 kW•h pack. Top speed was .
Plans were announced in 2008 to sell the i-MiEV in European markets as the Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero. Mitsubishi began supplying the electric cars to PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) since 2010, and PSA has a contractual commitment to buy 100,000 i-MiEVs over a period that remained confidential.
Specifications.
Powertrain.
The production version of the 2009 i-MiEV has a single permanent magnet synchronous motor mounted on the rear axle with a power output of 47 kW and torque output 180 N•m. 
The motor is water cooled, there is a conventional automobile radiator in the front of the car with an electric fan. The coolant (with antifreeze) level is monitored via a tank under the rear load platform on the left hand side of the vehicle.(See picture adjoining.)
The vehicle uses a single-speed reduction gear transmission driving the rear wheels and has a 16 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The car's top speed is .
Under its five-cycle testing, the US EPA rated the American 2012 model year Mitsubishi i with a combined fuel economy equivalent of 112 MPGe (2.1 L/100 km), with an equivalent in city driving and on highways. This rating allowed the 2012 Mitsubishi i to get a higher MPG-e rating than the 2011 Nissan Leaf, which was rated at 99 MPGe (2.4 L/100 km) combined, but the Leaf rated a better range due to the Mitsubishi i's smaller battery pack.
Battery.
The lithium-ion battery pack consists of 88 cells placed under the base floor. The pack has 22 cell modules connected in series at a nominal voltage of 330 V. There are two 4-cell modules placed vertically at the center of the pack and ten 8-cell modules placed horizontally. Developed by Mitsubishi and GS Yuasa for both high specific energy and high rate discharge and manufactured by Lithium Energy Japan, a joint venture of GS Yuasa Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. The entire pack has a specific energy of 80 Wh/kg. The battery has a forced air cooling system to prevent overheating during high charge and discharge rates and consequent damage. There is an integral fan in the battery pack. For rapid charging, the battery pack is additionally cooled with refrigerated air from the cars air conditioning system.
In June 2011 Mitsubishi announced the introduction of lithium titanate oxide SCiB battery technology for its two new models of electric vehicles, the i-MiEV and Minicab MiEV. The SCiB technology was developed by Toshiba, which stated that its SCiB batteries can withstand 2.5 times more charge/discharge cycles than a typical lithium-ion battery. In addition, recharging via CHAdeMO takes much less time than charging at the AC Level 2 rate used by most electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), allowing the SCiB battery to reach 80% capacity in 15 minutes, 50% in 10 minutes and 25% in 5 minutes. In terms of performance, the SCiB battery offers a higher effective capacity than a typical lithium-ion battery, which combined with more efficient regenerative charging during braking or coasting downhill, allows the SCiB battery to deliver 1.7 times the driving range per charge of a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size. Alternatively, the carmaker could install a smaller battery with less weight and keep the same range to contribute to lower the vehicle price as compared to lithium-ion batteries. Recharging is estimated to take 14 hours from a 110 volt power supply, 7 hours from a 220 volt power supply and as little as 30 minutes from a quick charging station.
Charging (Europe, 230 volts).
On the left hand side of the car towards the rear is the “rapid” DC . CHAdeMO charging point. It is beneath a cover (released from inside the car), there is a dust cover beneath to keep out insects etc. There are two large pins (for the charging current) and eight small ones for control circuitry. The cable used for this purpose is captive to the roadside charging point. When the car is on fast (DC) charge, the air conditioning system is automatically started and refrigerated air is blown through the battery pack for cooling purposes. There is a diverter flap in the ventilation system for this.
On the right hand side of the car is the “fast” and “slow” AC charging point, accessed in a similar way to the DC charge point. This is a five pin point. Three large pins are the line, neutral and earth/ground. The two small pins are a control circuit. This circuit enables the charge current to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the plug and socket are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the control box (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for a padlock to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary. There is a “floating” control box in the middle of this lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 amps so enabling an eight hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts)
Emergency power supply.
In the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Mitsubishi introduced one year ahead of schedule a device called MiEV Power Box that enables the i-MiEV to supply power to home electric appliances in the event of a power outage or natural disasters. The device provides 100-volt outlets, converting the i-MiEV's direct current (DC) battery power into 100 volts alternating current (AC) to power up to 1,500 watts of small electrical equipment. Mitsubishi estimates that the i-MiEV total battery capacity is enough to provide power for between 5 and 6 hours, equivalent to one day of power consumed by an average Japanese home. The device was scheduled to be available by the end of April 2012, at a cost of () but as of November 2013 it is not clear if this is widely available.
Regeneration control.
The manufacturers have made every effort to make the very different technology of this car appear similar to conventional cars.
The lever between the front seats appears to be an automatic transmission control but is not so, though it works in a similar fashion. 
It is in fact a switch which reverses the electric motor and also offers a degree of control (European cars) over the regeneration. Correct use of the regeneration control can influence the range of the car.
As well as "park" "neutral" and "reverse" there are three regeneration positions, intended for city driving, hilly terrain, and flat terrain respectively. Used correctly, on most journeys, a large percentage of kinetic energy and potential energy can be returned to the battery. Lifting off the accelerator/”gas” pedal also induces regeneration as does light pressure on the foot brake. The only other mechanical losses are frictional. The main loss is aerodynamic drag which is proportional to the square of speed, hence high speeds are inefficient and reduce range.
Regeneration and power consumption can be monitored by the driver with an analogue instrument on the dashboard/control panel which shows both instantaneous power consumed and regeneration.
Electrical equipment.
The heating of the passenger cab is by a conventional "wet" automotive system. Heat is derived from the traction battery via a resistance element. Use of the heater significantly reduces range. The traction motor cooling system runs at much lower temperatures than in a conventional car and is therefore separate from the cab heating system. While the car is charging, the interior can be preheated to alleviate the range reduction problem.
The car is fitted with air conditioning. The compressor is located beneath the HVAC controls in the car and has its own electric motor driven from the traction battery via a dedicated inverter. The condenser is mounted in front of the traction cooling radiator at the front of the car. The evaporator is inside the HVAC control. Use of the air conditioning system can significantly reduce range. To alleviate this, the car can be set to "precool" whilst on charge. A remote control/timer device is provided that controls the preheat function, air conditioning and also controls and monitors battery charging.
There is an auxiliary, 12volt conventional lead acid battery under the bonnet/hood for the accessories. It is also needed to control and charge the main traction battery and to start the vehicle. It is charged from the main traction battery via a DC-DC voltage reduction device. If it is discharged, the vehicle cannot be started, neither can the main traction battery be charged. Use of 12 volt "jump cables" from another vehicles is possible.
The steering is rack and pinion with electric power assistance.
An emergency cutoff for main battery is located under the front left hand seat. If the car is involved in a collision, there is a cutoff switch that is operated by the "G" forces involved.
Wheels.
The front and rear wheels are different sizes. Instead of a spare wheel, a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (plugs into cigarette lighter) and a bottle of repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.
Braking system.
The braking system is conventional hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.
Range.
The all-electric range is on the Japanese test cycle. Two additional trim levels will be available in Japan beginning in late July 2011, the entry-level “M” with a 10.5 kWh battery pack has a reduced range of , and the higher-level "G" with the same a 16.0 kWh battery as the original i-MiEV has a range of . The "G" trim will be available by mid August.
The US EPA official range for the 2012 model year American "i" version is based on the five-cycle tests using varying driving conditions and climate controls. Under the LA4 driving cycle for city conditions, EPA's rated range is . According to the carmaker, the city range of the 2012 Mitsubishi i was improved as compared to the previous i-MiEV versions, through software upgrades and a revamped regenerative braking system.
The Australian Government's Green Vehicle Guide estimated the i-MiEV's range to be .
Towing the car (breakdown).
The drive system is permanently connected to the rear wheels. This means that if there is mechanical damage to the power train the vehicle must be transported/towed with the rear (driving) wheels off the ground to prevent further damage. 
For other problems so long as power is available for the braking and steering system, the vehicle can be conventionally towed subject to instructions in the owner's manual. Using the car to tow trailers is not recommended.
Safety.
The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) awarded the i-MiEV a four star car safety rating, earning the following ratings for each criteria. The tested model was a left hand drive 5-door hatchback registered in 2011:
Euro NCAP also states that "accordingly, Euro NCAP believes that the star rating of the i-MiEV can also be applied to the Citroën C-Zero" because the agency was informed that the Citroën C-Zero is structurally identical to the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and has the same interior fitting and levels of safety equipment.
The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rated the i-MiEV four out of five stars for crash safety, scoring 28.35 out of 37. This score takes into account the 10.95 out of 16 rating in the frontal offset crash test, and the score of 14.4 out of 16 received for the side impact test.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the 2012 model year i-Miev a four out of five star crash rating.
Fire incident.
In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors reported two separate incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, one with an i-MiEV and the other with an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to a charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall but halted production and sales of the two models until it determines the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related with a change in GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker called fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated and is working on a possible fix.
Production.
Full production of the i-MiEV started in July 2009 and Mitsubishi expected initial sales volume to be small, to sell up to 1,400 vehicles by March 2010, but expected sales to rise to 5,000 vehicles in the following twelve months, once retail sales had started. Mitsubishi decided to target sales to corporate customers in Japan at first to allow local governments and businesses to set up recharging stations around the country. The company said initial sales were constrained by production capacity but expects production to ramp up quickly from 2,000 units in 2009/10 to 30,000 vehicles within three years as it expands production of lithium-ion battery through Lithium Energy Japan, a joint venture with GS Yuasa Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation. Production was projected to increase to 9,000 units in its fiscal year 2010/11, and to 18,000 in the following twelve months.
Production of the left-hand drive European-spec i-MiEV began in October 2010. By the end of November 2010 cumulative production had reached 5,000 units at Mitsubitshi's Mizushima Plant. In May 2011 Mitsubishi announced a new production target of 25,000 i-MiEVs worldwide in fiscal year 2011. The carmaker also plans to export about 15,000 units overseas, mainly to Europe, where the company will promote sales to the European public sector, such as police departments and local governments. Production of the American-spec i electric car began in late October 2011. Since July 2009 Mitsubishi had manufactured more than 33,000 i-MiEVs and rebadge versions by March 2013, including more than 11,000 units rebadged in France as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero, and sold in the European market.
In August 2012, and as a result of Europe's debt crisis that resulted in PSA Peugeot Citroen (PSA) Group slow sales, Mitsubishi Motors announced the suspension of its supply of the i-MiEV electric vehicle to PSA, although the period for supplying vehicles under their contract as part of original equipment manufacturer agreements has not yet ended. The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory. PSA only sold 50% of the sales target set for 2011 and according to PSA the supply was only temporarily interrupted.
Markets and sales.
The Mitsubishi i MiEV was the first electric car to sell more than 10,000 units, including the models badged in Europe as Citroën C-Zero and Peugeot iOn. The record, officially registered by Guinness World Records, was reached on February 2011. Several months later, the Nissan Leaf overtook the i MiEV as the best selling all-electric car. Accounting for all vehicles of the iMiEV brand, Mitsubishi reported around 27,200 units sold or exported since 2009 through December 2012, including the minicab MiEVs sold in Japan, and the units rebadged and sold as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero in the European market. , more than 28,000 i-MiEV family passenger cars have been sold worldwide since 2009. Japan is the top selling market with 9,402 i-MiEVs sold through December 2013, followed by France with 4,455 units of the i-MiEV family registered through December 2013, Norway with 4,241 units registered, Germany with 2,307 units, and the United States, with 1,697 i-MiEVs sold through December 2013.
Australia.
During early 2009 the i-MiEV was exhibited in Australia at the Melbourne International Motor Show, and afterwards was toured throughout the country. Beginning in mid 2009, Mitsubishi conducted a twelve month field trial with potential electric vehicle customers, such as local, state and federal government bodies, and major fleet operators.
Sales for fleet customers began in Australia in August 2010 under leasing agreement at a price of a month for 36 months, for a cumulative total of after which the car has to be returned to the dealer. The initial shipment included only 40 units, but Mitsubishi Motors Australia reported that just before the launch it had received applications for more than 100 vehicles from private companies and government departments. The initial batch of vehicles leased to government and corporate fleets totals 112 vehicles.
Retail sales to the public began in August 2011. Currently, there are no government incentive or rebate schemes for purchasing fuel-efficient vehicles in the country. The new Australian i-MiEV version is similar to the European-spec model released in 2011, with minor changes such as new three-spoke alloy wheels, a few minor exterior tweaks including dark tinted headlights and a revised front bumper with fog lights. With an Australian Design Rules approved range of , the Australian-spec i-MiEV is sold for ( as of July 2011) through specially equipped Mitsubishi dealerships (one in each capital city and two in Sydney). Mitsubishi anticipates 5 sales to the public per month. Since then a large number of dealerships across Australia have purchased scoops of these vehicles and most dealerships (mainly in Victoria) have a single i-Miev in their showrooms at prices never seen in this market before. During 2011 a total of 30 i MiEVs were sold, and cumulative sales reached 252 units through December 2013.
Canada.
In January 2009, Hydro-Québec and Mitsubishi signed an agreement to test 50 i-MiEV, the largest pilot test of electric cars in Canada ever. The test's goal was to allow a better understanding of winter usage of the technology. BC-Hydro and Mitsubishi had previously tested a three-vehicle fleet in British Columbia. The first five i-MiEVs were delivered in December 2010 and were assigned to staff from the city of Boucherville. In October 2010, Transport Canada and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Canada announced a partnership to test the Mitsubishi i-MiEV. Transport Canada’s ecoTECHNOLOGY for Vehicles (eTV) Program tested two i-MiEVs in government facilities and in a variety of real-world conditions. This program aim was to evaluate the i-MiEV road performance and range.
Retail sales of the i-MiEV began in December 2011 at a starting price of () before any government incentives available in Ontario and Quebec. Cumulative sales through December 2013 reached 387 units.
Mitsubishi sells the US i-MiEV version in Canada, although the international version was used in test fleets, and two trims are offered, standard and premium. The premium package price is () and includes leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, 15-inch alloy wheels, premium audio system, HDD Navigation system, Bluetooth 2.0 hands-free cellular phone interface with streaming audio and USB input with voice control.
Europe.
The European version of the i-MiEV was introduced at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. Specific features of the European version include a new design to the front and rear bumpers to meet EU regulations, re-arranged center stack in the instrument panel, improved interior comfort and both active and passive safety features have been improved with the addition of Active Stability Control (ASC), as well as side and curtain airbags, all included as standard equipment. The European MiEV achieves an all-electric range of under the European NEDC driving pattern.
Mass production of the European i-MiEV began in October 2010 at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant, along with production of its siblings by PSA Peugeot Citroën, the Peugeot iOn and the Citroën C-Zero. In January 2011, Mitsubishi shipped 2,500 i-MiEVs from Japan and began sales in 15 countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and further expand the European roll out through 2011. Mitsubishi also run demonstration programs with the i-MiEV in the Principality of Monaco, Iceland, and Denmark.
The price of the European version vary by country waqs set to around to ( to ). The carmaker aimed for a final cost to the customer of under () or equivalent after government incentives.
Austria.
Retail deliveries began in 2011. A a total of 704 units have been registered in Austria through December 2013, including 332 C-Zeros, 254 i MiEVs, and 118 iOns.
Denmark.
Deliveries began in 2011. A total of 550 units have been registered in Denmark through December 2013, including 227 iOns, 202 C-Zeros, and 121 i MiEVs.
Estonia.
On March 3, 2011, the government of Estonia confirmed the sale to Mitsubishi Corporation of 10 million carbon dioxide credits in exchange for 507 i-MiEV electric cars. The deal also includes funding to build 250 express charging stations in larger towns and main highways by 2013, and will subsidize the first 500 private buyers of any electric car approved by the European Union. The first 50 i-MiEVs were delivered in October 2011 and this official fleet will be assigned for use by municipal social workers. During the first round of allocations of the electric cars, municipalities requested only 336 of the 507 i-MiEVs available. Several local authorities have stated concerns about the electric car performance during harsh winter conditions, maintenance costs and the i-MiEV' reliability on difficult countryside roads.

Mithayi Mane

Mithai Mane is a 2005 Kannada film directed by Aarathi (whose daughter wrote the screenplay). The title (which means "candy house") was inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel. The film explores the theme of how children would find fulfillment in a candy house they came across in a forest. Actually, the sweetness and fulfillment is illusory; the reality is that there is a witch living inside who uses the appearance of the house to catch children, so she can cook them and eat them.
Plot.
"Mithai Mane" is the story of an 11-year-old girl named Ganga, who leaves from a poor village to work as a maid for a well-off family in the city. Her situation is compared throughout the movie to the plight of Gretel (held prisoner in the witch's cottage), and her story is interwoven with a voice-over narration of the Hansel and Gretel story. One of Ganga's tasks is to bring the household children's lunch boxes to their private school. At the school she is befriended by Swathi, a schoolgirl who wants to help her. As their friendship grows, Ganga becomes more aware of her surroundings. Child labor is at the heart of this film, but it is treated with gentle irony and there is no assignment of blame. The well-to-do family is self-absorbed and insensitive, not cruel and exploitative. The audience, however, has seen the plight of the villagers and the contrast with the opulence of the city-dwellers is obvious. The most powerful image is the open-eyed and honesty that Ganga brings with her from the village. These qualities will eventually force her to leave the sugar-coated house in the city where everything is a little too sweet. Ganga is played by child actor Aditi.
Cast and crew.
"Mithayi Mane" was produced by Chandrasekar Desigoudar, and the score was composed by N. S. Prasad. Among the cast were Aditi, Dharmendra Urs, Surabhi J. Herur, Hanumantha Raju, Ragashree Prasad, Akshara, Deeksha Naik, Panchami, Lakshmi Nada Gowda, Padma Shimoga, Shailashree, Suchitha Anthunadhan, Pallavi and Raghavendra. The film was directed by former Kannada actress Aarathi, based on a short story written by her daughter Yashaswini.
Santosh Rai Pathaje was the cinematographer; in addition to his camera work, he has also directed Savi Savi Nenapu and Seven O' Clock.
Awards.
"Mithayi Mane" won the Best Children's Film award for 2004–05 issued by the Government of Karnataka, and Aditi won the Best Child Actor award for her role in the film.

La Vieille Charité

La vieille charité is a former almshouse, now functioning as a museum and cultural centre, situated in the heart of the old Panier quarter of Marseille in the south of France. Constructed between 1671 and 1749 in the Baroque style to the designs of the architect Pierre Puget, it comprises four ranges of arcaded galleries in three storeys surrounding a space with a central chapel surmounted by an ovoid dome.
Construction.
The idea of an almshouse for the poor, dedicated to "Notre-Dame, mère de Charité" (Our Lady, Mother of Charity), was originally conceived in 1622; but it was not until 1640 that a suitable plot of land was acquired, with the first pensioners admitted in the following year. Although the foundation stone was laid in that year, construction commenced only in 1671, following a grand plan of the architect Pierre Puget. It was not completed until 1749, construction being prolonged as the result of reductions to the project imposed by the aldermen of Marseille. The central chapel was erected between 1679 and 1704, although Puget died before its completion.
Architecture.
The main body of the structure is a rectangle, 112m by 96m, composed of four walls in pink and yellow-tinted molasse stone from the ancient quarries at Cap Couronne, with no outward facing windows. On the inside are three arcaded galleries superposed on each other, opening onto an interior courtyard measuring 82m by 45m. In the centre of the courtyard is a harmonious chapel, a round church, crowned by an ellipsoidal dome and fronted by a portico in the classical style with Corinthian columns. This Baroque chapel ranks as one of Puget's most original designs. 
Historic use.
In the seventeenth century the repression of beggars was conducted with great brutality in France. Guards called "Chasse-gueux" ("beggar-hunters") had the task of rounding up beggars: non-residents among them were expelled from Marseille, and natives of Marseille were shut up in prison. Often the crowd would take the side of the beggars during such arrests.
The almshouses served as workhouses for the beggars. Children were found jobs as domestic servants, cabin boys or apprentices with seamstresses or bakers. As time passed the work of la Vielle Charité grew, the number of inmates increasing from 850 in 1736 to 1059 in 1760. As the imprisonment of the poor became less acceptable, the numbers decreased to 250 in 1781.
Spared during the French Revolution, the building was used as an asylum for "les vagabonds et les gens sans aveu" (vagrants and the dispossessed) in the nineteenth century. It was transformed into a barracks for the French Foreign Legion until 1922, when it was used to lodge those displaced by the demolition of the district behind the Bourse and later those made homeless by the dynamiting of the Old Port during the Second World War. Plagued by squatters, pillagers and vandals, it eventually housed 146 families living in squalid and unsafe conditions, a group of around 30 Little Sisters of Jesus living in equally abject conditions to their charges, and various small concerns, devoted amongst other things to transport, packing of anchovies and ripening of bananas. In 1962 all the residents were rehoused and the building shut down. It was only in 1968, thanks to the intervention of the Minister of Culture André Malraux, that funds became available to rescue the buildings, by then in a state of total dereliction. La Vieille Charité was painstakingly restored to its former glory between 1970 and 1986, restoration of the chapel being completed in 1981.
Current use.
La Vieille Charité houses a number of different cultural and educational resources:

Antonia Arslan

Antonia Arslan (born 1938) is an Italian writer and academic of Armenian origins.
Arslan was born in Padua. After graduating in archaeology she became a professor of modern and contemporary Italian literature at the University of Padua and published copious groundbreaking studies, "inter alia", on Italian popular fiction and Italian women writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Her primary concern as a literary critic is the Italian literary canon, an issue she most recently addressed at the "Dana Drake Lecture".

It was, among other awards, the winner of that year’s Premio Berto, Premio Fregene, Premio Stresa di Narrativa, Premio Fenice-Europa. It was selected as a finalist for the 2004 (and won) the Premio Campiello award. After winning the Il Campiello Secondo Noi by a spectacular margin - the book received nearly 50% of all votes, outstripping the second place book by 26 votes - Antonia Arslan's "La masseria delle allodole" was expected easily to win the Premio Super-Campiello. and the Premio Manzoni. It was selected as a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. The book has been translated into numerous languages and inspired the Taviani brothers’ 2007 film "La Masseria Delle Allodole".
Her second novel, "La Strada di Smirne", was published in 2009 by Rizzoli, and it appeared in Armenian as "Smyrniani Janabar" in 2012. 
Arslan's more recent publications include "" (2009) published by "Rizzoli", and chronicles her brush with death in 2009, "Il cortile dei girasoli parlanti" published by "Piemme Edizioni" in 2011, and "Il libro di Mush" published by "Skira" in 2012. The latter book is an account of the "Msho Charantir", the largest surviving Armenian manuscript. It won the prestigious "Premio Giuria Viareggio". 
Arslan has received such awards as the "Narekatsi Medal" (2010) and the "Movses Khorenatsi Medal" (2012) for her cultural contributions.

Essentiale

Essentiale (polyenylphosphatidylcholine or PPC, with or without synergistic vitamins) is a preparation of essential phospholipids. Essentiale normalizes the metabolism of lipids and proteins, improves the detoxification function of the liver, restores the cellular structure of the liver and retards the producing of conjunctive tissue. Essentiale medications are indicated for the treatment of fatty degeneration of the liver, hepatitis (including toxic hepatitis, liver damage caused by medicines or alcohol abuse), cirrhosis of the liver, disturbances in liver function associated with different illnesses.
Pharmaceutical action.
Phospholipids are essential structural components of all cellular membranes. 
Essential phospholipids (substance EPL) - are the complex substances of natural origin (ethers of cholinephosphoric acid (phosphatidylcholine) and unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic, olein)). 
Essentiale medications possess the membranotropic properties, metabolic and hepatoprotective action; regulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. 
Essential phospholipids increase functional status of the liver.
While the disturbance of the liver metabolism essential phospholipids ensure the entering the high energy phospholipids, which are ideally combined with the endogenous phospholipids. Under the Essentialle phospholipids influence clinical and biochemical liver indexes are improved.
Combination of Essentiale with cordiamin (nikethamide) and vitamin E (50 mg/kg for 35 days) considerably activates the mono-oxygenase, glucoro- and glutathione transferase systems of the liver: and as a result the free-radical processes became less intense.
The spectrum of essential phospholipids' activity in chronic degenerative liver diseases can be described in the following properties: 
Common use.
Essentiale is used to treat the following diseases:
diabetes(the data suggests that Essentiale protects and improves liver function in diabetic
subjects with non alcoholic fatty liver ) and chronic infections);
Availability.

Utah State Route 53

State Route 53 (SR-53) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting I-15/I-84 with US-89 via Ogden's 24th Street. SR-53 was created in 1969 as a remnant of SR-37, which was truncated to its current length at that time.
Route description.
SR-53 begins at exit 342 of I-15, and heads northeast of Pennsylvania Avenue before curving east into 24th Street. A viaduct built in about 1970 takes the road over the Weber River, the Union Pacific Railroad's Ogden Yard at the old Union Station, and SR-204 (Wall Avenue). Two blocks after SR-53 returns to ground level, it ends at US-89. The entire route is in the Weber Valley, which locally slopes down towards the Weber River.
History.
24th Street west of SR-1 (US-91, now US-89) was added to the state highway system in 1915, becoming part of SR-37 in 1927 and SR-38 in 1931, only to be given back to SR-37 in 1964 (along with former SR-39 on 24th Street east of US-89). The state legislature removed parts of SR-37 from the state highway system in 1969, renumbering the portion between I-15 and US-89 as State Route 53.
Major intersections.
The entire route is in Ogden, Weber County.

PS Frontenac

Frontenac was a steamboat, the first paddle steamer launched on the Great Lakes, in 1817.
Built in Ernesttown, Ontario, by American contractors for Kingston businessmen during 1816 at a cost of ₤15,000, she entered service in spring 1817. "Frontenac" conducted regular runs across Lake Ontario between Kingston, York (now Toronto), and Niagara-on-the-Lake, but rarely managed to make money in eight years; the provincial population was simply too small.
"Frontenac" was sold for ₤1550 to John Hamilton in 1824, who persisted two more unsuccessful years before selling her for scrap at Niagara in 1827. Before she could be scrapped, she burned to the waterline due to arson.

Stanisław Egbert Koźmian

Stanisław Egbert Koźmian (1811–1885) was a Polish writer. He is now best known as a translator of Shakespeare.
Life.
Together with his brother Jan Koźmian, he took part in the Polish insurrection of 1831, and subsequently lived for a period in exile. Stanisław settled in England.
He set to translating Shakespeare, a work which occupied him for thirty years, and was not complete at his death; he also translated poems by Lord Byron, John Moore, Robert Southey, Percy Shelley, William Cowper, and passages of Campbell on Poland. He was secretary to the Society of Friends of Poland, and in close relation with Lord Dudley Stuart.
Returning to Posen (now Poznań), he became president of the Poznań Society of Friends of Learning.
Works.
Of his original work, the poem best known in his days was entitled "To the Masters of the Word", addressed to Mickiewicz, Krasinski, and Zaleski in 1846. He especially was a follower of Krasinski, two of whose books ("The Day of To-Day" and "The Last One") first appeared as Koźmian's, as the author would not otherwise have published them. Their success put Kolźian in a very false and painful position, which he described in one of his poems—an imitation of Dante's "Inferno".
His prose consists mainly of essays, many of which were published together in two volumes under the title "England and Poland". The first volume is descriptive: what the English thought, what they knew of Poland, how far their friendly feeling went, why the majority of the nation were indifferent to what might befall Poland, and so on. The second gave particulars of English institutions, life, politics, and literature.
He wrote numerous short articles, particularly on literature. As a journalist he took an unpopular Catholic line, and was comparatively unknown in his lifetime.

Quand nos bourgeons se rouvriront

”Quand nos bourgeons se rouvriront” ("When the spring comes round") is a song for solo soprano, part of a staged recitation with orchestra "Une voix dans le désert" written by the English composer Edward Elgar in 1915. The words are by the Belgian poet Émile Cammaerts'".
It was first performed in a performance of "Une voix dans le désert" at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, on 29 January 1916, sung by the soprano Olga Lynn, with the recitation by the Belgian dramatic performer Carlo Liten, and the orchestra conducted by the composer.
The French title ""Quand nos bourgeons se rouvriront"" literally translates into ""When our buds shall re-open"", but in the English version of the lyrics, by Cammaerts' wife Tita Brand, it became ""When the spring comes round"". 
The song was published separately by Elkin & Co. in 1916, inscribed "English version by R. H. Elkin". The words are the same as in the vocal score of "Une voix dans le désert", so it is not clear whether the English translation of the song is by Tita Brand or by Elkin.
"The Pall Mall Gazette" described the scene on the wartime front in West Flanders, Belgium:

Total known weight

Total known weight (TKW), also total known mass, is a term used mainly by dealers and meteorite collectors to indicate the combined weight of all known pieces from a single named meteorite. The total known mass of a named meteorite is a fraction of the mass of the original meteoroid that entered Earth's atmosphere to produce the meteorite (also called post-atmospheric mass).
Mass and TKW.
Meteoroids that produce meteorites ablate as they pass through the atmosphere and lose mass. Thus, the total mass of a meteorite fall will always be lower than that of the original meteoroid (neglecting the mass of any terrestrial oxygen added to meteorites during the formation of their fusion crust). The upper limit to the "total known mass" of a meteorite is therefore the mass of the meteorite fall.
Several factors can cause the "total known mass" of a meteorite to be less than the mass of the fall. Meteorite falls frequently occur as showers of stones (see main article), produced when the parent meteoroid fragments. Only in cases where 100% of any such fragments are recovered, could the "total known mass" be the same as the mass of the fall. As previously undiscovered fragments are found, the "total known mass" could, in principle, rise. However, this is complicated by the method by which meteorites are named. Historically (before the 1970s), every meteorite was given a simple geographical name. The total number of known meteorites was small and it was generally a simple matter to determine when a newly found fragment was "paired" to a previously discovered meteorite. When pairing could be established, the new fragment would not be given a new name, and the "total known mass" of the original meteorite would increase. But, recent discoveries of arid regions containing large concentrations of meteorites have resulted in new rules for meteorite nomenclature. In these cases, individual meteorites are numbered (again, see main article), and every newly discovered fragment receives a unique number, even if there is a strong case that the new fragment is paired with an earlier discovered meteorite. In these cases, the "total known mass" of the meteorite is fixed at the time of the find, and cannot increase.
Use.
Low TKW means less materials for scientists and collectors. The total known weight is a key factor in pricing, especially with rare meteorite types.

Buchanania obovata

Buchanania obovata is a small to medium sized understorey tree in woodlands native to northern Australia. Common names include green plum and wild mango.
Leaves are smooth, thick, leathery, broadly oblong, long and wide. Flowers are small, cream-coloured and across. The fruit is smooth, fleshy, lens-shaped, long.
The species was formally described in 1883 based on plant material collected from Escape Cliffs in the Northern Territory by C. Hull.
Uses.
The fruit is traditionally eaten by Aborigines. The plant also has traditional medicinal uses.
During an expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington between 1844 and 1845, explorer Ludwig Leichhardt encountered the species which he, at the time, identified as "Coniogeton arborescens":

Atlantic Corridor

The Atlantic Corridor is a road project in Ireland that eventually will link Waterford in the South-East to Letterkenny in the North-West by high-quality dual carriageway or motorway. A major infrastructure project, the scheme was announced as part of the Transport 21 project launch in 2005, and is due to be completed by 2015. Some sections are running ahead of this schedule with others, such as the Ennis bypass, already completed. However, it is likely that major sections of the project will remain at the planning stage owing to cutbacks in the 2010 budget.
The Atlantic Corridor, when combined with the inter-urban motorways linking Dublin and the other cities (except Derry), will effectively ring the island of Ireland, while at the same time connecting the primary population and economic centres.
National primary roads.
The constituent routes are:
Progress.
Following the motorway re-designations of 28 August 2009, 27.8 km of the route is now motorway.

Francisco de Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso

Francisco de Portugal, also known as Francis II of Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso (c. 1550 – 1582), was the eldest son and heir of the 2nd Count of Vimioso, Afonso de Portugal (Alphonse of Portugal).
He was one of the few high-ranking Portuguese nobles to support the claims of António, Prior of Crato, during the War of the Portuguese Succession (1580–1583).
Early life.
As his first official position, he was appointed special ambassador to Madrid (1574) in order to negotiate the marriage of King Sebastian of Portugal to Princess Maximiliana of Bavaria (daughter of Duke Albert V of Bavaria), but the mission failed.
Later, in 1578, along with his father, he participated in the royal crusade to Morocco, and he fell prisoner to Ahmad al-Mansur's armies during the Battle of Ksar El Kebir. He managed to pay his ransom and even helped others to pay theirs. He returned to Europe through San Lucar, in southern Spain, where he was received with all honours by the Duke of Medina Sidonia, Alonso de Guzman. As he testified of the King's death during the battle, there and for the first time he supported "Dom" António, Prior of Crato as the natural heir of the Portuguese throne, refuting the Spanish Duke’s position for Philip II of Spain's claims.
Fight for freedom.
After King Henry’s death (31 January 1580), Francis of Portugal was one of the few members of the upper aristocracy to support actively "Dom" António as King of Portugal. He was appointed by the new King as his Constable, and they participated together in the Battle of Alcântara (1580), defending Lisbon from the Spanish armies, led by the Duke of Alba.
With Philip's victory, both King Anthony I and the Count of Vimioso fled to exile, first in France and later in England.
In 1582 he sailed, in the fleet led by the Italian adventurer Filippo Strozzi, to the Azores, the sole Portuguese territory that still recognised Anthony I as King of Portugal. He died on 29 July 1582, just after the naval Battle of Vila Franca off São Miguel Island.
Dom Francisco de Portugal was never married and had no issue. He was succeeded in his house by his younger brother, Louis of Portugal, 4th Count of Vimioso.

Dara-I-Pech District

Dara-I-Pech District (also known as Manogay District or Pech District) is located western-central part of Kunar Province, Afghanistan, 30 km West from Asadabad. The population is 48,400 (2006). The district is governed from Mano Gai. The governor is Mohammad Rahkman.
While the bulk of the population is Safi Pashtun, who are mostly settled along the Pech River, the district also includes the Pashai-speaking Korengalis in the southern portion of the Korengal Valley. 
There are several large capillary valleys, such as the Korengal and Shuryak. There are 13 big villages and most of them are in the valleys of the mountainous district. There has been a timber market. People are generally poor. Farming and animal husbandry are the main sources of income. Health care and education need improvement.
Nangalam, at the junction of the Pech and Waygal Rivers, is the largest town in the district. Formerly inhabited by speakers of a Pech Valley Dardic (Indic) language called Nangalami, the village was destroyed by Afghan troops in 1978. When it was rebuilt, the inhabitants were predominantly Safi Pashtuns. The major coalition base of Camp Blessing is located near Nangalam to the west.
In 1999 the area was affected by extensive fires which burned through thousands of acres of forest in the Dara Pech Valley, displacing some 300 people and the Taliban in power at the time appealed to the UN for assistance.
On 13 November 2003, an explosive device was detonated in a bus in the area, killing four people, two of them children.
The Korengal Valley has been the scene of sustained fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents. The New York Times magazine ran a story by contributing writer Elizabeth Rubin entitled Battle Company Is Out There on Feb. 24, 2008.
The book "Siren's Song: The Allure of War" by Antonio Salinas was published in 2012. The book depicts the experiences of an American Platoon at COP Honaker Miracle in the Dara-I-Pech District.

Mother of the Church

In Roman Catholic Mariology, Mother of the Church (in Latin Mater Ecclesiae) is a title, officially given to Mary during the Second Vatican Council by Pope Paul VI. The title was first used in the 4th century by Saint Ambrose of Milan, as rediscovered by Hugo Rahner.
The title "Mother of the Church" was used by Pope Benedict XIV in 1748 and then by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. Following the title's usage by Leo XIII, it was later used many times in the teachings of John XXIII and Paul VI. The title was also used by Pope John Paul II and is used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
Pope John Paul II stated that overall the title indicates the Blessed Virgin Mary's maternity of Christ's faithful, as deriving from her maternity of Christ in that "Mary is present in the Church as the Mother of Christ, and at the same time as that Mother whom Christ, in the mystery of the Redemption, gave to humanity in the person of the Apostle John John 19:27. Thus, in her new motherhood in the Spirit, Mary embraces each and every one in the Church, and embraces each and every one through the Church."
St. Ambrose and Hugo Rahner.
The use of the "Mater Ecclesiae" title to the Virgin Mary goes back to Ambrose of Milan in the 4th century, but this was not known until its 1944 rediscovery by Hugo Rahner. Rahner's Mariology, following Ambrose, sees Mary in her role within the Church. His interpretation, based solely on Ambrose and the early Fathers, greatly influenced Vatican II and Pope Paul VI, who, quoting Ambrose, declared Mary the "mother of the Church", a view continued by Popes John Paul II and Joseph Ratzinger, who, prior to his election to the papacy, stated that it was Hugh Rahner's "greatest achievement".
Pope Paul VI.
Pope Paul VI pronounced the title at the closing of the third phase of the council completely on his own. A former archbishop of Milan, Paul VI used similar language to that of Saint Ambrose of Milan, calling Mary "Model of the Church" in light of her faith, love and complete unity with Christ and "Mother of the Church" because she gave birth to Christ.
Paul VI made the pronouncement of the title Mother of the Church during his speech upon the closing of the third session of the Second Vatican Council on September 21, 1964: "For the glory of the Virgin and our consolation, we proclaim Mary the Most Holy Mother of the Church, that is, the Mother of the whole People of God, both the faithful and the pastors."
In "Redemptoris Mater" Pope John Paul II referred to Paul VI's "Credo of the People of God" as a reaffirmation of the statement that Mary is the "mother of the entire Christian people, both faithful and pastors" and wrote that the Credo "restated this truth in an even more forceful way":
Pope Benedict XVI also referred to the "Credo" of Paul VI and stated that it sums up all of the scriptural texts that relate to the matter.
Pope John Paul II.
In 1987, Pope John Paul II repeated this title "Mother of the Church" in his encyclical "Redemptoris Mater" and at a general audience on September 17, 1997.
With regard to the title "Mother of the Church", John Paul used "Redemptoris Mater" as an opportunity to explain how the Blessed Virgin Mary's maternity of Christ's faithful derives from her maternity of Christ, as well as how Mary serves as a "type", or model, of the Church as a whole.
On September 17, 1997, Bl. Pope John Paul II devoted a Wednesday general audience to the title "Mother of the Church" with regard to its application to the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Pope Benedict XVI.
Pope Benedict XVI addresses the issue, why Roman Catholic Mariology is related to ecclesiology, the teaching about the Church. On first sight, he argues, it may seem accidental, that the Council moved Mariology into ecclesiology. This relation helps to understand what "Church" really is. The theologian Hugo Rahner showed that Mariology was originally ecclesiology. The Church is like Mary.
The Church is virgin and mother, she is immaculate and carries the burdens of history. She suffers and she is assumed into heaven. Slowly she learns, that Mary is her mirror, that she is a person in Mary. Mary on the other hand is not an isolated individual, who rests in herself. She is carrying the mystery of the Church.

Affiliate (novel)

Affiliate (Notes of a Radio Presenter) (Russian: "Филиал (Записки ведущего)") is a novel by the Russian writer Sergei Dovlatov. It was written in November of 1987 in New York.
Plot introduction.
The story is set in New York in the 1980s, and then moves to Los Angeles. It is told in the first person by a man called Dalmatov, seemingly loosely based on Dovlatov himself: he is an immigrant from Russia, and an unsuccessful writer, working for the American-based Russian-language press.
Dalmatov presents a programme in Russian on the radio, and is sent to Los Angeles to report on a conference of Soviet dissidents. When he arrives, he bumps into his first love, Tasya, and the memories of their courtship when they both lived in the Soviet Union come flooding back.
Analysis.
The story is told in episodic form, in a style reminiscent of aphorisms. Present day events are interspersed with flashbacks from the narrator's youth. The is a heavy emphasis on the absurd, and how it can bring levity to depressing reality.
Publication history.
The book was published in Zvezda (magazine) in 1989 and then published in New York by publishing house Слово (Word) in 1990.

Gabriella Cilmi

Gabriella Lucia Cilmi ( ; born 10 October 1991) is an Australian singer-songwriter. In 2008, Cilmi was awarded six ARIA Music Awards, including Single of the Year and Best Female Artist. Her debut album, "Lessons to Be Learned", was released in March 2008, becoming a moderate international success. Her second studio album, "Ten", was released in March 2010. Her third studio album, "The Sting", was released in November 2013.
Early life.
Gabriella Cilmi was born in the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong. Of Italian and Albanian heritage, she moved to London with her family when she was fifteen, where she currently lives with her parents Paula and Joe (whose origins are in Calabria and Sicily, Italy) and her brother Joseph.At an early age, Cilmi developed an interest in a wide range of pop music acts, including Nina Simone, Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin, The Sweet, T. Rex and Cat Stevens. She has also cited Suzi Quatro as a particular influence. Despite her natural aptitude and vocal talent, Cilmi was told that she lacked the discipline necessary to pursue a singing career. Idolising Janis Joplin, during this time she sang with a band (Foucault) covering songs by Led Zeppelin, Jet, Silverchair and others. Cilmi recorded original songs with writer/producers Barbara and Adrian Hannan of The SongStore.
In 2004, Cilmi captured the attention of Warner Music executive Michael Parisi while giving an impromptu rendition of the Rolling Stones' song "Jumpin' Jack Flash" at the Lygon Street Festa, a community festival in Melbourne. At the age of 13, Cilmi travelled to the US and UK with Adrian Hannan and was offered four major US deals. She eventually signed a contract with Island Records UK.
Musical career.
2005–09: "Lessons to Be Learned".
The tracks "Don't Tell Me" and "Sorry", co-written with Barbara and Adrian Hannan, appeared on the soundtrack of 2005 Australian film "Hating Alison Ashley". Cilmi shares a manager (Cassandra Gracey), writer/producers (Xenomania) and UK record label (Island) with the Sugababes, and supported former Sugababe Mutya Buena at the Jazz Café in London in 2007. She made her UK TV debut in December 2007 when she sang her single "Sweet About Me" on "Later... with Jools Holland". The same month, Cilmi's song "Sanctuary" featured in the film "St Trinian's" and on . Cilmi recorded the theme to UK TV series "Echo Beach", which aired in early 2008 on ITV1; it is a cover of "Echo Beach" by Martha and the Muffins. In February 2008, she supported the Parisian band Nouvelle Vague on their UK tour.
Cilmi's first album, "Lessons to Be Learned", was written and recorded with hit production team Xenomania and was released in March 2008 in the UK. Cilmi has been compared to Amy Winehouse. The first single, "Sweet About Me", debuted on the UK Singles Chart that month and climbed to number six three months later, in June. It reached number seventeen on the Irish Singles Chart, and peaked at number one on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. The song was used in a worldwide advertising campaign for the deodorant Sure/Rexona. Cilmi's second UK single, "Save the Lies", was not as successful as "Sweet About Me", peaking at number thirty-three in the UK. In Australia, the second single from the album was "Don't Wanna Go to Bed Now", which reached number twenty-eight. The subsequent single, "Sanctuary", was issued in November 2008 and failed to chart.
From March to May 2008, Cilmi supported the Sugababes on their UK Change Tour. She opened for James Blunt on his June 2008 Australian tour, and participated in the October 2008 MTV Greece concert alongside R.E.M. and Kaiser Chiefs. Also in 2008, Cilmi won six ARIA Music Awards in Australia, taking Best Female Artist, Breakthrough Artist – Single ("Sweet About Me"), Breakthrough Artist – Album ("Lessons to Be Learned"), Best Pop Release ("Lessons to Be Learned"), Highest Selling Single ("Sweet About Me"), and Single of the Year ("Sweet About Me").

In January 2009, Cilmi was nominated in the International Female category at the BRIT Awards and sang in the Rod Laver Arena before the 2009 Australian Open Men's Final.
Cilmi performed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 2009 for Sound Relief, a multi-venue rock music concert in support of relief for the Victorian bushfire crisis. The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne Concert will go to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Cilmi made her U.S. television debut in March 2009 and performed on the Pyramid (main) stage at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2009. The following August, she won Grand Prix at Sopot International Song Festival, an international song contest in Poland.
2010: "Ten".
The lead single of Gabriella Cilmi's "Ten" is "On a Mission". It was released on 5 February 2010 in Australia and on 7 March 2010 in Europe. As soon as the song was broadcast on Australian radios, it reached number-one most added track to Australian radio in its second week of release, getting played 296 times. The song reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and number sixteen in Australia.
The new album "Ten" was planned for 22 March 2010 and Cilmi said it would feature "lots of uptempo funk and disco-inspired numbers designed to make people groove", referring to "On a Mission", "Hearts Don't Lie", and "Love Me Coz", as well as "some more sexy tracks" probably referring to "Superhot" and "Invisible Girl". The song "Boys" incorporates a type of yodel into it. The song "Let Me Know" is described as the "Lessons To Be Learned-ish" song of the album.
It also features a new version of "Sweet About Me", with some disco/electronic style to show her music has changed.
While producing the album, Cilmi worked with Greg Kurstin, The Invisible Men and Dallas Austin, as well as Xenomania. She made her debuts in producing songs with the track "Love Me Coz", she says the song she is most proud of due to the fact it was produced with her band. It features production from Xenomania, Dallas Austin and Greg Kurstin, and bears an electropop sound in contrast to her first album, which had more of a pop/rock style.
"Ten" was not as successful as "Lessons to Be Learned", reaching number 17 in Australia and number 28 in the UK. In an interview, Cilmi explains that the sales were not her first concern; however, she regrets posing topless for FHM magazine "Ten" during publicity for the album. She said in January 2012 that for her new album, she won't stoop to the same tactics.
The second single, "Hearts Don't Lie", was released in June 2010 in the UK. while the third single, "Defender", was released in August 2010 accompanied by a b-side track, "Magic Carpet Ride", but both singles failed to make impact on the charts. Gabriella's version of "Magic Carpet Ride" was featured over the closing credits of British film "Soulboy". Cilmi supported English artist Leona Lewis on the UK leg of her 2010 The Labyrinth Tour.
Popjustice named "Ten" as their fourth best album of 2010.
2010–present: "The Sting".
By October 2010, Cilmi had already begun work on her third studio album. She has been quoted as saying: "It's totally exciting because I am spending a bit more time with this record. I want to see what works. I really love Dolly Parton, roots music, Tricky and Enya, so anything could happen."
On 20 January 2012, Cilmi released an acoustic version of a song from her album, "Vicious Love". It is played in a clip video where she sings with her band and walks around an Italian restaurant with sunglasses. Two days after the broadcast, she says: "This is an 'Acoustic-ish' version of a tune that will be on the new record, one that I love very much". The song has blues influences, contrasting the disco-inspired pop sound of "Ten". Cilmi claims she felt pressured into adopting a more sexual image, which prompted her to part ways with Island Records and her management team. She also told the "Herald Sun" that the lacklustre commercial reception of her second album, "Ten", taught her not to compromise herself or her music: "It was an awakening for me to realise the position I am in to make the record that I want to make and just stand up for myself."
On 22 January 2012, Cilmi explained how the song "Vicious Love" was inspired. She states: "If you've ever experienced any type of 'Vicious Love' you will know that sometimes despite all the arrows pointing to a dead end there is just no way out, there is no way back. But then again don't all roads lead to dead ends? Guess we should just enjoy the ride..." In March 2013, Cilmi first performed "Sweet About Me", as well as two new songs "Come Wander With Me" and "Sweeter in History", at the Moxafrica Festival. On 15 March, the clip from her new single "Sweeter in History", is shown on her YouTube page. It was shot in Italy, precisely in Cassino and Valvori, Lazio. In July 2013, Cilmi announced a new track called "The Sting", released on 2 September as the album's lead single. The artwork of the single was revealed on 15 July 2013, picturing Cilmi in black and white, in front of a flower field. Cilmi's third studio album, "The Sting", was released on 4 November 2013 on her own UK-based imprint Sweetness Tunes, in association with Absolute Marketing & Distribution. "Symmetry" was released on 11 November as the album's second single.
Artistry.
Voice.
Cilmi has a contralto vocal range and has been compared to Anastacia and Amy Winehouse for her vocal stylings. Cilmi also discovered her sound was partly caused by a back problem, known as hollow back or lordosis, which affects the way in which she uses her diaphragm muscles when singing, producing a more throaty sound. In a review for "Ten", Caroline Sullivan of "The Guardian" complimented her voice stating it as 'precociously blistering' and 'Her zest and powerful voice can't be faulted'. Take40 commented further 'a voice that sounds like it fell from the heavens' further noting her abilities as a 'vocal powerhouse' and being a 'brilliant and unique vocal talent'.

Underground City (Beijing)

The Underground City (), also known as Dixia Cheng, is a bomb shelter comprising a network of tunnels located beneath Beijing, China, which has since been transformed into a tourist attraction. It has been called the Underground Great Wall because it was built for the purpose of military defense. The complex was constructed during the 1970s in anticipation of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, and was officially reopened in 2000. Visitors were allowed to tour portions of the complex, which has been described as "dark, damp, and genuinely eerie". Dixia Cheng has been closed for renovation since at least February 2008.
Location.
The tunnels comprising Dixia Cheng run beneath Beijing's city center, covering an area of under the surface. At one time there were about 90 entrances to the complex, all of which were hidden in shops along the main streets of Qianmen. Known entrances include 62 West Damochang Street in Qianmen, Beijing Qianmen Carpet Factory at 44 Xingfu Dajie in Chongwen District, and 18 Dazhalan Jie in Qianmen.
History.
At the height of Soviet-Chinese tensions in 1969, Chinese chairman Mao Zedong ordered the construction of Dixia Cheng during the border conflict over Zhenbao Island in the Heilongjiang River. It was one of the bomb shelters constructed in case of a nuclear attack. The Underground City was designed to withstand either a nuclear or conventional attack. The complex would enable Beijing's population to hide from air raids, and could allow China's leaders to flee safely to military bases in the hills. The government claimed that the tunnels could accommodate all of Beijing's six million inhabitants upon its completion.
The complex was equipped with facilities such as restaurants, clinics, schools, theaters, factories, a roller skating rink, a grain and oil warehouse, and a mushroom cultivation farm, for growing foods that require little light. There were also more than 70 sites inside the tunnels at which water wells could be dug. Elaborate ventilation systems were installed, with shafts that could close to protect against water and chemicals, and gas and waterproof hatches were constructed to protect people in the tunnels from chemical attack and radioactive fallout. The complex also had thick concrete doors, which help protect the tunnels from intruders or a flood.
There is no authoritative information on the extent of the complex's tunnels, but one tourist explained that they link Beijing's central railway station with Tiananmen square, the Temple of Heaven, the Forbidden City and the Western Hills, while the China Internet Information Center asserts that "they supposedly link all areas of central Beijing, from Xidan and Xuanwumen to Qianmen and Chongwen district", in addition to the Western Hills. It is also rumoured that every residence once had a secret trapdoor nearby leading to the tunnels. In the event of a nuclear attack, the plan was to move half of Beijing's population underground and the other half to the Western Hills.
The tunnels were built by more than 300,000 local citizens, including school children, and were mostly dug by hand. Centuries-old city walls, towers and gates, including the old city gates of Xizhimen, Fuchengmen, and Chongwenmen were destroyed to supply construction materials for the complex.
Since the complex was built, the tunnels were used by young lovers and by children daring each other to remain in the darkness longer than their friends. On busy streets, some portions of the complex were used as inexpensive hostels, while others were transformed into shopping and business centers, or even theaters.
While the complex has never been used for its intended purpose, it has been maintained by city officials; water conservancy authorities check it every year during rainy seasons, and it is included in anti-vermin sweeps.
As a tourist attraction.
The complex was officially opened in 2000, but has been closed for renovation since at least February 2008. While it was open, visitors were allowed to tour portions of the complex; the Underground City was popular with foreign tourists but remained virtually forgotten by local citizens. Despite having many entrances, foreign visitors entered approved sections accessed via a small shop front in Qianmen, south of Tiananmen Square, at 62 West Damochang Street. Tour groups could enter free of charge and without prior permission while individual tourists not part of a group were charged 20 yuan (US$2.40) each.
The official tour took visitors only on a small circular stretch of the Underground City. Inside the complex, visitors could see signposts to major landmarks accessible by the tunnels, such as Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and could see chambers labeled with their original functions, such as cinemas, hospitals, or arsenals. A portrait of Mao Zedong could be seen amidst murals of locals volunteering to dig the tunnels and fading slogans such as "Accumulate Grain", and "For the People: Prepare for War, Prepare for Famine". Rooms with bunk beds and decayed cardboard boxes of water purifiers could be seen in areas not open to tourists. Visitors on the official tour would also pass by a functioning silk factory operations in one of the underground staff meeting rooms of the complex, and be given a demonstration of the process of obtaining silk from silkworm cocoons, and a chance to buy souvenirs at a tourists' shop operated by the state-owned Qianmen Arts and Crafts Center and the China Kai Tian Silk Company.

Hans Fronius

Hans Fronius (12 September 1903 - 21 March 1988) was an Austrian painter and illustrator.
He was born in Sarajevo, which was then a territory of Austria-Hungary (now Bosnia and Hercegovina). His father was descended from an old, aristocratic Transylvanian Saxon family Fronius. As a young boy, he witnessed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, an event that would later form the subject of his book, "Attentat in Sarajevo" (English: Assassination in Sarajevo).
After the First World War, Fronius's family moved to Graz in Austria. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. From 1930 to 1960, he taught art and projective geometry at a grammar school in Fürstenfeld, Styria. His leftist sympathies put his teaching position in jeopardy after the "Anschluss", and in 1943 he was drafted into the German army.
The art historian Otto Benesch called Fronius "the most significant Austrian illustrator since Alfred Kubin." His work is considered an example of 'Expressive Realism', with subjects that include portraits, street scenes, and literary interpretations. He was one of the first illustrators of the stories of Franz Kafka, and contributed illustrations to works by Edgar Allan Poe.
He remained a prolific artist until his death at age 84 in 1988.
