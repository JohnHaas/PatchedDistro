FH Aachen

The FH Aachen - Aachen University of Applied Sciences is one of the biggest Fachhochschulen in Germany with roughly 11,300 students, 220 professors, 300 contract lecturers, and 340 assistants. It is specialized in certain topical areas (e.g. technology, engineering, business, design). It must not be confused with the RWTH Aachen, which is also located in Aachen. FH Aachen ranks as the first best among the universities of Applied Sciences in Germany in the fields of Electrical and Mechanical engineering. Ten Faculties offer 48 Bachelor's, 22 Master's and three cooperative degree programmes. In 2011 the external and research funding added up to 12,2 million Euro. 
The FH Aachen is situated in Aachen and in Jülich.
History.
The FH Aachen was established in 1971 as a result of the amalgamation of several universities of applied sciences and vocational training centres. Thus, it can look back on a practice-oriented educational tradition going back more than 100 years. 
The Federal Framework Law for Education in 1976 raised the legal status of all Fachhochschulen to a position equal to that of traditional universities. Within the context of law, the FH Aachen, like all other FHs, is autonomous, meaning that freedom of teaching, research and academic self-administration are guaranteed rights. From 1985 till 2000, Jesco von Puttkamer taught at the FH Aachen as honorary professor.
Degree Programmes.
FH Aachen offers 48 Bachelor's, 22 Master's and three cooperative degree programmes. Dual degree programmes have been developed in recent years at the FH Aachen in close cooperation with the Chambers of Industry and Commerce (IHK). Moreover some of the degree programmes are international oriented studies (IOS) which means that the courses are given in English during the first two semesters and in German in the following semesters. 
Locations.
Seven of the ten faculties, with a total of over 8,000 students, are located in Aachen: Architecture, Civil Engineering, Design, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Aerospace Engineering,
Business Studies, Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics. Furthermore, the Rectorate, the Head Office and the Central Library are also here.
Three faculties with more than 3,000 students altogether are located in Jülich: Chemistry and Biotechnology, Medical Technology and Applied Mathematics as well as Energy Technology.
All services for students, such as academic counselling, the Department of International Affairs, the Registrar’s Office, department libraries, student dormitories and cafeterias, are available both in Aachen and in Jülich. While the Jülich site displays a campus atmosphere since all facilities are together in one place, the Aachen site is not a campus university. Its facilities are spread across the city of Aachen in seven buildings, some of which have a long tradition.
International Activities.
The FH Aachen maintains partnerships with 170 universities around the world. The students benefit from this cross-border network because it enables them to gain valuable overseas experience in the framework of their studies. The Department of International Affairs is the contact concerning all international topics at the FH Aachen. 
Freshman Institute.
The Freshman Institute is a central academic organization within the FH Aachen (Aachen University of Applied Sciences). Its aim is to enable international applicants to qualify for a place on a degree program in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Due to the Program’s special status, the regulations of the German Central Office for External Education Systems (Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen, ZAB) are replaced by the Program’s own entrance examinations. 
After successfully completing the Freshman Year, students can apply to universities in North Rhine-Westphalia. Resembling in its form and function the first year of a four-year Bachelor degree programme common in the Anglo-Saxon education system, the Freshman Year is financed solely from the fees paid by its students. 
Institutes.
Institutes are scientific institutions of the university. They bundle competencies to carry out intensive research and development. This takes place in cooperation with institutes of other universities
in Germany and abroad, with research institutions and frequently with industry.
The FH Aachen currently has the following institutes:

Love Is a Wonderful Thing (Michael Bolton song)

"Love Is a Wonderful Thing" is a song recorded by American pop music singer Michael Bolton. The song was included on Bolton's 1991 album, "Time, Love & Tenderness". It was written by Bolton and Andrew Goldmark and produced by Walter Afanasieff.
In 1964, the American R&B group The Isley Brothers recorded a song titled "Love Is a Wonderful Thing". Not included on an Isley Brothers album until years later, the song was released as a single in 1966 on a 45-rpm vinyl record, and it "bubbled under" on the "Billboard" pop chart, meaning that it peaked at #110 on the Hot 100. Bolton's song contained similarities to the song by the Isleys that exceeded the title: in 1994, a jury found songwriters Bolton and Goldmark, along with Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Bolton's label, Columbia Records), liable for copyright infringement due to multiple similarities between the two songs and ordered them to pay the Isleys all profits earned from the single plus 28% of the album profits, which amounted to over $5 million (U.S.). On May 9, 2000, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, an appellate court covering the western regions of the U.S., affirmed the jury's decision, which is one of the largest monetary sums to be awarded in a case such as this. On January 22, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to review the decision of the appellate court despite Bolton's claims that he had never heard the Isley Brothers recording (although he was a fan of their music) and that he was exercising his right to "independent creation". The decision by the Supreme Court not to hear the case resulted in the original verdict remaining valid.
Bolton's song peaked at number four on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in June 1991, becoming his fourth top ten hit. It also spent four non-consecutive weeks atop the "Billboard". adult contemporary chart. The song peaked at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart.
The song was also used in the credits of the 2010 film "MacGruber".

<doc id="18457365" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18457365" title="Claricilla">
Claricilla

Claricilla is a Caroline era stage play, a tragicomedy written by Thomas Killigrew. The drama was acted c. 1636 by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre, and first published in 1641. The play was an early success that helped to confirm Killigrew's choice of artistic career.
Publication.
"Claricilla" was entered into the Stationers' Register on 4 August 1640 and published the next year in a duodecimo volume that also contained Killigrew's first play, "The Prisoners". The volume was printed by Thomas Cotes for the bookseller Andrew Crooke. The book included commendatory verses by William Cartwright and by Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington.
The play was later included in "Comedies and Tragedies", the collected edition of Killigrew's plays issued by Henry Herringman in 1664; in this collection it is dedicated to Killigrew's sister, Lady Shannon. This edition states that the play was written in Rome, during Killigrew's Continental travels in 1635–36.
Genre.
Killigrew's choice of the tragicomic genre for his first three plays, "The Prisoners", "Claricilla", and "The Princess", made sense in terms of his social and cultural millieu. Killigrew was aspiring to join a circle of dramatists associated with the English royal court and especially with the coterie around Queen Henrietta Maria. That circle of playwrights included Cartwright, Lodowick Carlell, and Sir John Suckling (and, to a more qualified degree, Sir William Davenant). They tended to produce tragicomedies tinged with themes of Platonic love, the favored genre of the Queen's court. (For an extreme example of the Queen's type of drama, see "The Shepherd's Paradise".)
When Killigrew was no longer committed to that type of courtly drama, he would write a radically different kind of play, in his comedy "The Parson's Wedding".
The name.
In the original 1641 edition, the play's title and the heroine's name is spelled "Claracilla." The spelling was changed to "Claricilla" in the 1664 collection. Normally, scholars would give the original spelling priority; yet since there are indications that Killigrew oversaw Herringman's 1664 collection, the revised spelling appears to have the authority of the creator, and many scholars have accepted it on that basis.
In either spelling, the name may derive from "Chariclea," the name of the heroine in the "Aethiopica" of Heliodorus, one of Killigrew's sources for the plot of his play.
In a verse prologue to his play "The Doubtful Heir", James Shirley notes the contemporary fashion for naming plays after their heroines. The examples he cites are "Claricilla" and Suckling's "Aglaura".
The 1653 performance.
"Claricilla" was one of the rare plays surreptitiously acted during the Interregnum, when the London theatres were officially closed; the 1653 performance at Gibbon's Tennis Court was raided by the authorities. The performance was allegedly betrayed by an actor. A contemporary source, the Royalist periodical "Mercurius Democritus", hinted that the guilty party was William Beeston. In its 2-9 March issue, the periodical blamed "An ill Beest, or rather Bird" for betraying the "Claricilla" actors, because they denied him a share in the proceeds — and indicated that this actor was involved in attempts to stage plays "in his own house." The "ill Beest" may signify W"ill" "Beest"on; as for the "Bird," actor Theophilus Bird was Beeston's brother-in-law and business associate. Beeston was then trying to resume dramatic performances at his "house," the Salisbury Court Theatre. And Beeston controlled the rights to "Claricilla", explaining why he would feel entitled to a share of the profits of any performance. 
In the Restoration.
Killigrew produced a revival of "Claricilla" early in the Restoration period, in December 1660, with his King's Company. Samuel Pepys saw it on 4 July 1661. Pepys saw the drama again at the Cockpit on 5 January 1663, when it struck him as a "poor play," and on 9 March 1669, when he conceded in his Diary that "there are a few good things in it."

Higher education in Nunavut

Higher education in Nunavut allows residents of this Canadian Arctic territory access to specialized training provided at post-secondary institutions. There are some unique challenges faced by students wishing to pursue advanced training in Nunavut, a vast territory stretching across Arctic Canada from Hudsons Bay to the north pole. The territory was split from the Northwest Territories in 1999, following a successful plebescite which affirmed Inuit desires to establish an independent political jurisdiction. Covering one-fifth of Canada’s area and over 60% of its coastlines, the territory had a population of 31,153 in 2010.
There are no universities in Nunavut. Nunavut Arctic College is the only institution of higher education. It offers a small number of degrees in conjunction with Dalhousie University - Nunavut Nursing Program, University of Regina - Nunavut Teacher Education, University of Prince Edward Island - Master of Education in Leadership and Learning program, and the former Akitsiraq Law Program, recently and unexpectedly disabled by the territorial government, given its widely acknowledged successes and accolades. Northerners can also receive training in both very basic academic and vocational studies. Due to the distance and lack of connecting roads between communities, the college attempts to operate on the basis that adult education must be delivered in all communities and that the training be tailored to address individual and community needs. 
Nunavut and the Canadian North have begun to think about and address the issues of language and quality of education in K to 12 through the creative and demanding Education Act (Nunavut 2008) which strongly supports Inuit languages and culture in the school system. The implementation of this fundamental legislation is propelling an intensive effort to strengthen and improve the quality of primary and secondary education, but also has compelled a closer look at Teacher Education in the College, and the quality and ability of graduates to teach effectively at all levels. The first two terms of the Nunavut government invested very strongly in new schools in Nunavut Communities leading (among other factors) to a steadily increasing number of high school graduates, bringing additional pressures to the College through additional adult learners. The College has struggled to effectively meet this expanding demand for higher quality, diversity, and expanded delivery. 
The external dialogue has also accelerated recently with former Governor General Michaëlle Jean speaking in favour of an Arctic University GG advocates for Arctic learning, 
-Attempts to build an the "Arctic University", an alliance of 30 institutions with circumpolar components, located mostly in existing institutions with Arctic research mandates, and 
- ~ The declaration of the three territorial Premiers (Yukon - Fentie, NWT - Roland, Nunavut - Aariak) who, in a September 2009 Conference Communique "committed to examine options for the development of a northern university" in common. 
The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation has taken up the issue of post-secondary education in the Canadian North, both through its Arctic Voices Fellowship program and through its commitment to sponsor a 2010 conference among territorial interest groups to address a common institutional design which would enhance post-secondary learning across Canada's northern territories.
History.
Although the territory of Nunavut was created in 1999, Nunavut Arctic College (NAC) was created in 1995 through legislation implemented January 1, 1995, when the former Arctic College was split into Aurora College in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Arctic College in the eastern arctic. Today this early split is seen as an attempt by the dominant western college to retain resources and funding after division and has been seen at the heart of the multi-year struggle of the College to fulfill its mandate, address public perception, despite a number of successful and effective graduates, that instruction and student quality are low and that many students drop out or become perpetual enrollees in an atmosphere where instructors take advantage of weak management and collective bargaining status as "teachers" with school year type holidays and no obligations for research and long term scholarship. 
The major campuses of Nunavut Arctic College are Nunatta Campus in Iqaluit on Baffin Island, Kivalliq Campus at Rankin Inlet, and Kitikmeot Campus at Cambridge Bay. The three campuses have very distinct atmospheres and approaches, some being vital and active with committed leadership and others being regrettably perfunctory in performing their obligations. The College has also established Learning Centres in twenty-four of the twenty-six communities on the territory. The efficiency and quality of these Centres varies with the enthusiasm and basic abilities of the single supervising instructor, and the College struggles to maintain these feeder institutions with minimal financial support and varying program success. Prior to 1999 most campus infrastructure had been built in the western territory, and Nunavut Arctic College is still running to catch up with the need for classrooms and residences to serve an exploding youth population in Nunavut.
Governance.
Higher education in Nunavut is the responsibility of the territorial government, consistent with jurisdictions across Canada. Three main pieces of legislation govern post-secondary education in Nunavut:
Access.
For admissions into Nunavut Arctic college, students are required to meet the specific requirements for their chosen program. Programs are not offered at all campuses of Nunavut Arctic College, so interested students are required to submit an application directly to the campus or community centre with the course offering. International and Out of Province Canadians are required to submit applications before April first of each year, and only a limited number of seats are available to these students.
Training partnerships.
Nunavut Arctic College has entered into training partnerships programs for variety community and funding agencies. These programs have aided northern residents in gaining skills needed for enhancing their positions within small business, government and non-governmental organizations. Customized certificates are created specifically for the needs of the community and the organization with the help of public and private sectors. Some examples include: a Community Health Representative Program for the Government of Nunavut's Health and Social Service sector, a Community Lands Administration Certificate for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and an Inuit Resource Management Certificate for the Nunavut Implementation Training Committee. The Director of Customized Training is a special unit based at the Kivalliq Campus located at Rankin Inlet.
Transfer agreements.
Nunavut Arctic College is a member of the Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer (ACAT); therefore, the college has formed formal transfer arrangements with Aurora College in the Northwest Territories and many Alberta institutions. Students are advised to refer to the Transfer Guide for information on course eligibility. The college has arranged bulk credit transfer for other Canadian universities including McGill University in Quebec, Royal Roads University in British Columbia, Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, and the University of Manitoba in Manitoba.
Funding.
Financial assistance is available to qualified students in Nunavut though: Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC), the Financial Assistance for Nunavut Students (FANS), and the various regional Inuit Organizations. A student is responsible to initiate the funding request.
Tuition fees are established by the Minister of Education. In the current (2005–2007) calendar, the tuition fees were set at $1000 per term for full-time students, $200 per course for part-time students and free for senior citizens (defined as a student over the age of sixty).
Future direction.
Higher education in Nunavut is in the infancy stage. The Government of Nunavut recognized that higher education is critical for economic and intellectual development; therefore, a strategy was developed to address unique challenges and opportunities found in Canada's north. The Nunavut Adult Learning Strategy completed in March 2006, recommended a five year strategy to address the needs of the adult learner in Nunavut. This includes career training, literacy, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (traditional knowledge), and professional education. The report recommended the restructuring the Department of Education, changing how vocational and apprentice training is delivered, improve career guidance and development, and the creation of a mature student graduation certificate. Adult literacy is identified a key barrier for employment for Arctic inhabitants, as Nunavut is a region with jobs in skilled sectors like mining, fishing, tourism and government.
The strategy identified that advances in post secondary training are required in Nunavut; however, the recommendation was made that Nunavut Arctic College continue to work with major Canadian universities to deliver specialized training. The small population and geographic expanse did not allow for a free standing university, particularly in a conventional form, until more residents complete their K-12 education. This position appears to be changing, there have been attempts to re-define the nature of a university which could service this population base, and there is the potential for exciting change in the coming years.

Richard Berkowitz

Richard Berkowitz (born October 6, 1955) is a gay American author and activist best known as an early advocate of safe sex in response to the AIDS crisis among gay men in the 1980s. The award-winning 2008 documentary "Sex Positive" directed by Daryl Wein is about his life and activities.
Life and career.
Berkowitz was born to Jewish parents and raised in New Jersey, where he attended Rutgers University in the mid-1970s. While in college, he organized what he believes was the first gay rights protest in the state, demonstrating against an anti-gay effigy hung by the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. After college, Berkowitz moved to New York City in 1978 or 1979, earning a living as a self-described S&M hustler.
Even before AIDS was recognized as a syndrome, Berkowitz became concerned about protecting his clients, many of whom were married, from sexually transmitted diseases. He met physician Joseph Sonnabend and became a patient, learning from Sonnabend the practices for risk reduction that would later become known as safe sex. His early work with Sonnabend and singer and activist Michael Callen noted behaviors including drug use, multiple sexual partners, and unsafe sexual practices in the gay community for transmission. These claims were considered controversial by early leaders of Gay Men's Health Crisis, such as Larry Kramer, and many activists took issue with the language of their message and its implications. The 1983 pamphlet "" by Callen and Berkowitz (in consultation with Sonnabend) is widely considered the first sex-positive guide to practicing safe sex. Berkowitz tested positive for HIV in 1984 but was able to avoid taking any anti-viral drugs until 1995.
"Sex Positive" documentary.
Berkowitz is the subject of the 2008 documentary "Sex Positive" directed by Daryl Wein and winner of the 2008 Outfest Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary. The film was released on DVD in June 2010.

The Ontario government subsequently purchased reserve land from the federal government in 1928. In 1947, the federal government purchased a tract of land in Mountbatten Township from the Ontario government and established the Mountbatten 76A Indian Reserve. The Band moved to its present reserve at Duck Lake 76B Indian Reserve after of the Mountbatten 76A were exchanged in 1973 for an equivalent area of land closer to Chapleau, Ontario.
Governance.

Blitum californicum

Blitum californicum (Syn. "Chenopodium californicum") is a species of flowering plant in the amaranth family known by the common names California Goosefoot and (ambiguously) "Indian lettuce". 
It is native to California and Baja California where it can be found below in open areas in a number of habitat types, such as grassland, chaparral, desert, and montane. 
Description.
This is a perennial herb producing a number of decumbent to erect stems which approach a meter in maximum height when growing upright. It grows from a thick, fleshy caudex. When there are many stems the plant may form a clump or mat. The leaves grow on long petioles and are triangular or arrowhead-shaped and up to about 10 centimeters long. The edges are deeply and sharply toothed. 
The inflorescences are spherical clusters dotted along an inflorescence-like spike. Each dense cluster contains several rounded flowers, with each flower a series of flat lobes covering the developing fruit. The fruit is a reddish utricle layered around the surface of the seed.
Uses.
California goosefoot was used for a variety of purposes by Native Americans including use as a medicine and a source of soap, in addition to the use of the seeds for flour and the leaves and shoots as a cooked vegetable.

2008 Israel–Hezbollah prisoner exchange

The 2008 Israel–Hezbollah prisoner exchange took place on 16 July 2008 when Hezbollah transferred the coffins of two Israeli soldiers in exchange for 5 Lebanese militants held by Israel as well as the bodies of 199 militants captured in Lebanon or Israel.
Exchange.
Hezbollah released the remains of two captured Israeli soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, in exchange for Palestine Liberation Front militant Samir Kuntar, who was convicted of murder in Israel and Mahir Kourani, Mohammad Surour, Hussain Sulaiman and Khadr Zaidan, four Hizbullah militants captured by Israel in the 2006 Lebanon war. Israel also returned the remains of about 200 Lebanese and Palestinian militants killed whose bodies had been brought to Israel and buried there. Eight of these were Hizbullah fighters killed in the recent war. 
It has long been the general policy of Israel not to return to family for burial the remains of killed militants that had engaged in “hostile terrorist activity”. 
The exchange deal was carried out in accordance with the Red Cross and UN observers. 
Only one month earlier, on 1 June 2008, Israel released the Lebanese prisoner Nissim Nasser, in exchange for which Hezbollah handed over a box containing the remains of Israeli soldiers killed during the 2006 war.
In October 2007 Israel and Hizbullah agreed to exchange a civilian Hezbollah member captured in 2006 and the remains of two Hezbollah fighters killed in this war and brought to Israel for the remains of Gabriel Dwait, an Israeli resident who drowned and was washed ashore in Lebanon. The released prisoner was described as 50-year-old Hassan Naim Aqil, a former Hezbollah guerrilla who did not fight in the Second Lebanon War.
Media reactions.
There was a mixed reaction worldwide, many American news outlets criticising the release of Kuntar and condemning the way he was praised by the Lebanese. 
The swap was described as "lopsided" in news headlines in the U.S. "Newsweek" reported: "Americans often find it difficult to understand how Israelis can trade hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for one or two Israelis, alive or dead. Kuntar's case points up how frustrating and difficult those calculations can be."
Criticism of the celebrations held in Lebanon as repulsive and uncivilized were ubiquitous in the U.S. and other Western media. "Newsday" reported: "The reception Kuntar received has alarmed Israelis and Americans who don't understand why Lebanon declared a national holiday to honor a man convicted of killing four people in a 1979 attack, including a 4-year-old girl." In a "Boston Globe" article entitled "A strange kind of hero": But beyond all tactical and political considerations, there is something morally repulsive in the hero's welcome given the most famous - or notorious - of the Lebanese prisoners released by Israel. Samir Kuntar had been sentenced to 542 years in prison for killing four people during a raid in 1979. Kuntar executed a father, Danny Haran, in front of his 4-year-old daughter. Then he killed the little girl by smashing her head against a rock with a rifle butt.
This is the creature Nasrallah hailed as a resistance hero, the figure Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh called a "huge hero who sacrificed 30 years of his life for the Palestinian issue," the celebrity that Lebanon's president and prime minister saluted as a liberated freedom fighter.
All wars are inhumane. But not all warriors lose their humanity.
A writer for "Democracy Arsenal", hosted by the National Security Network, wrote, after describing the murders Kuntar perpetrated and the celebrations in Lebanon for him: "Not to take sides here, but when people wonder about the recalcitrance of Israeli leaders to enter peace agreements with their neighbors this revolting episode serves as a worthwhile reminder."
Canada's "Calgary Herald" reported: "No words can express the revulsion the civilized world feels for the hero's welcome given Samir Kuntar by Hezbollah upon his exchange for two Israeli soldiers killed in Israel's 2006 war with Lebanon." It concludes: Even sadder was Lebanon's declaration of a national holiday to celebrate Kuntar's return, along with his speech thanking God for his release. Not only is the blood of Smadar's family as red -- it has stained Lebanon's international image in the aftermath of such a shameful celebration.
David Pryce-Jones wrote: The Nazi S.S. killed Jewish children with a brutality similar to Kuntar's, but they did not then appear on public platforms to boast to the world of what they had done; on the contrary they kept their crimes as secret as they could, thereby acknowledging the survival somewhere in them of a guilty conscience. But here are important and supposedly responsible men who find it in themselves to embrace, encourage, and hold up as a model a man as vile as any, as though there was no such thing as conscience, and never has been. By every human standard, this is degradation, this is depravity.
In a "Baltimore Sun" editorial: "Trading the remains of two dead soldiers for a notorious terrorist and four Hezbollah militants hardly seems a fair exchange. And it wasn't. The Israeli reservists, Sergeant Goldwasser and Staff Sgt. Eldad Regev, were kidnapped in an unprovoked raid and wounded. ... In contrast, Mr. Kuntar's crime was a planned operation that terrorized a young Israeli family, leaving three of its members dead."
In "A moment of moral clarity", Gil Troy of McGill University writes in the "Montreal Gazette": "Stated angrily, 'How do you welcome a child murderer as a hero?' is the question Israelis are asking - and the rest of the civilized world should be asking, too. By contrast, the massive celebrations in Lebanon for Kuntar and four other terrorists revealed not only the thuggery of Hezbollah but the descent of Lebanon itself. Rolling out the red carpet for a murderer, dispatching the country's top leaders to greet someone who crushed a 4-year-old's skull, declaring a national day of celebration, revealed just how thoroughly the Lebanese leadership had succumbed to the brutal sensibilities of Hassan Nasrallah and his Hezbollah terrorists. He concludes: "A nation that risks so much even just to bring two corpses home, a country that celebrates life not death, is not only a worthy ally - but a dangerous adversary when provoked."
The Israeli consul general to the American Southwest wrote in the "Houston Chronicle": The way in which Hezbollah is celebrating the return of a man whom it calls a hero because Kuntar smashed the skull of a little girl is irrelevant. To Israel, whatever is said by people whose heroes are skull smashers, who hunt women and children in order to kill them, has no bearing. What is important are Israel's values.
In Israel's eyes, a hero is someone who fights terror to defend civilians at the risk of his or her own life. Israel's heroes go to battle equipped with, in addition to their weapons, the reassuring knowledge that they are protecting human beings who share their beliefs and who are also prepared to pay a price in order to realize them. Yarden writes that "For Hezbollah, Kuntar is a hero of the highest order. To Israelis and the rest of the civilized world, he is one of the most despicable terrorists," and includes that a Lebanese colleague has contacted him saying the celebrations were shameful for the Lebanese majority.

<doc id="18457565" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18457565" title="Kill Buddha">
Kill Buddha

Kill Buddha were an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California, active in 1992 – 1995. Kill Buddha toured around Southern California mainly playing in West Hollywood, Hollywood and Santa Monica clubs like The Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood), Raji's, and Alligator Lounge. During their formation, grunge was considered the new punk rock, but Kill Buddha did not sound like other acts of the day. Their sound had more pop elements and less metal, while providing a deep groove with edgy guitars.
The main members were Nick Delancy (Ken David Paul), Oscar Nomination (Andrew Burkhart), and Gary Dade. Mike Steele was in the band early on as the drummer, but he only lasted one week, and then Gary settled in. In 1993, David Botkin occupied the drum seat for a year while Gary suffered a nervous breakdown and escaped to North Dakota to recover, apparently, from a bad marriage.
Controversy surrounded the name of the band as most people thought they were anti-Buddhist or anti-religion, but this was not accurate. The idea of the name came from a saying in Buddhism, “Kill the Buddha”. The saying comes from the teachings ascribed to the Chinese Ch'an master Lin-chi I-hsüan (d. 866), ‘If you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha…in this way, you attain liberation.’ The intention was to shock students into realizing that they themselves were Buddhas, and that they had no need to depend upon, mistakenly objectify, or inordinately revere figures external to themselves.
Earlier band names used were: Luscious God Boys (a play on Keanu Reeves and his band, Dogstar), The Ruling Class, and f stop.
The Los Angeles music scene was still recovering from the Big Hair bands and phony showcases as a result of the prevalent pay-to-play policies that most of the clubs had during this time, so the Buddha's went south to Orange County and performed at Club Mesa for their first show. They liked the place and returned many times, eventually playing their final show there (which was professionally videotaped). The band also had befriended some San Diego musicians and were invited to play in San Diego's alternative clubs, The Casbah (US music venue) and Bodie's World Famous Dive Bar, but the Buddha's always failed to show up.
In late 1992, Kill Buddha entered Paramount Recording Studios (with Barry Conley engineering) and recorded 10 songs in 2 days, all performed live. They entered the studio again in early 1993 to record 4 new songs. All of these recordings were never released, although a few mix tapes did manage to get out to some of their fans. This material included many of their live show staples: Values, Fog, Greenflash (a holdover from Screams From the Trees), I Love You To Pieces, Grand Prix and Because You Stole Cherries, amongst others. Band interest waned on completing these recordings, and stopped altogether when Gary left. They decided to start fresh after David came aboard in late 1993 and recorded 5 new songs (one remains unreleased) at Cadillac Sound Studios.
In early 1994, Kill Buddha released their widely cherished self titled EP on Deviant Records (US) (currently out of print) which included four songs: Cleopatra, Liar Liar, The Antidote and Laundry. It found radio airplay mainly on KXLU, KNAC, KUCI, 91X as well as other radio stations around Southern California. Oddly, the EP was "rejected" by radio stations KROQ-FM and KLOS, so the band had the rejection letters framed and hung on the wall of their record company. The EP was also a favorite that was played most nights at Raji's in Hollywood. Industry insider Bob Timmons (Geffen Records, Nirvana, Aerosmith, Smashing Pumpkins) was also extremely impressed after seeing them perform and approached them about representation. The EP was making the rounds at CBS Records in Santa Monica and was generating a buzz. Unfortunately, they would never benefit from the goodwill that was building.
Kill Buddha had decided to quit in January 1995 before playing their last show at Club Mesa.
Later, unbeknownst to the individual band members, they all had eventually relocated to San Francisco. Upon discovering this in 1999, they reunited for a one-off gig in October, which was recorded (presently unreleased).
Band member history.
Prior to Kill Buddha, Ken, David and Andrew, along with Michael Kerns (Paramount Recording Studios) were in the LA band, Tocan (1978-1980).
Gary Dade was previously a member of LA metal band Armored Saint (1980-1982), Tempered Steel (1983-1985), influential industrial LA band Screams From The Trees (1987-1989) (sometimes with Andrew) and also appears on Bruce Drake's first solo release, Locust (2004). Gary Dade (2008) playied and recorded with Smokin' 66 (www.myspace.com/smokinsixtysix), based in Seattle. The band released a 6 song album in February 2009, "Smokin 66".. The name of the band came from bass player, Todd Perkins' restored 1966 Chevy Malibu, which had a personalized license plate reading "Smokin66". In 2009, Smokin 66 parted ways with singer Shannon. Presently, the band is known as Deliciously Infectious. They are presently on Hiatus after recording and performing in the Seattle area.
David Botkin (son of Perry Botkin Jr.) was a member of The Men (band) (1991-1992). David also appears on the Dr. Demento novelty track, Down with V.E.G. by The Amazing Onionheads (1994), which Andrew produced. Ken and David were in a "Men" side project band, Jimi's Kids (1991). During 2008-2009, David was playing in an L.A. area band which sometimes features Slash on guitar. David's current project is The Ooks of Hazzard, noted for their cover of MGMT's song "Kids", which went viral on YouTube in April 2010.
Andrew and Gary formed Joy Bang in 1995 as an on again, off again project (currently on hiatus), after Kill Buddha dissolved. A three song EP was released in 1995 (currently out of print). Some new material was recorded in 2007. Andrew also appears on Jackson Kayne's single, A Post Christmas (1987). Andrew and Mike Steele were also in Ray Rae's Tribute to Hendrix band (1989-1991), which performed around Los Angeles area clubs and colleges.

Leningradsky, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug

Leningradsky () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Iultinsky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia, about west of Mys Shmidta. Population: 
History.
The settlement was founded in order to provide accommodation for the workers and administrators of the nearby gold mines. When it was decided that the mines were no longer economically viable, the settlement was slated to be officially liquidated in 1998, a few years after it was decided to liquidate the neighbouring settlement of Polyarny, another settlement established purely to exploit the mineral wealth of the area.
Once the mines were declared unprofitable and that there was no possibility of developing any other form of economy in 1999 and the settlement was closed along with a number of others in Chukotka. The Russian government guaranteed funds to transport non-working pensioners and the unemployed in liquidated settlements including Leningradsky from Chukotka to other parts of Russia. The Ministry of railways was obliged to lease containers for the transportation of the migrants' goods to the Chukotkan administration and ensure that they were delivered to the various settlements. The population table below shows the impact on the settlement as a result of the closure of the mines.
The population was moved to other regions within the country however, due to a lack of suitable housing in many of these regions there was still a small population living in the settlement in 2000, hoping to become eligible for housing subsidy.
In 2005, there was a rebellion by a group of soldiers in the region. Drunk and bored with their duties in the far north, they took weapons and vodka and went to Leningradsky, seized the local store there and began to have a party, drinking and firing shots into the air. The police and FSB were notified and a seven hour battle took place with fatalities on both sides before the rebellion was quashed.
Economy.
The population's occupations are primarily fishing in the nearby Chukchi Sea and gold mining, with the regions three main prospecting teams in the region: Polyarnaya, Arktika and Shakhtar being based in Leningradsky. Mys Shmidta Airport is located to the east of the town on the outskirts of Mys Shmidta and along with the port is the prime means of supply for the settlement. Leningradsky is currently in the process of being liquidated. The prospecting team Shakhtar has been employing about 50 men for the last two decades, mostly from Ukraine who spend six months a year working in Chukotka and then six back at home on the "mainland". the gold is mined alluvially, with a ton of rock having to be washed to produce a gram of gold.
Transport.
Leningradsky is not connected by road to anywhere in the outside world however, a small system of roads exists within the settlement including:

Charlie Waitt

Charles C. "Charlie" Waitt (October 14, 1853 – October 21, 1912), born in Hallowell, Maine, was a professional baseball player who played a total of four professional baseball seasons. Waitt played in an era when baseball had many differences from modern baseball. He was in height, and in weight. He threw right-handed, but it is unknown whether he batted right or left-handed.
Career.
Charlie Waitt made his major league baseball debut on May 25, 1875 at age 22 with professional baseball club St. Louis Brown Stockings. While playing for the St. Louis Brown Stockings, Waitt had 113 at-bats, 23 runs, 2 base on balls, and 7 strikeouts.
Waitt is probably best known for being one of the first baseball players to wear a glove. He began wearing it around the 1875 baseball season, and was teased, taunted, laughed at by fans and his teammates, and called a "sissy" for doing so. The glove, which he wore to protect his hand, was very different from the gloves used today. He attempted to disguise them by using flesh-coloured gloves to make them as inconspicuous as possible.
After not playing the baseball season, Waitt was purchased from the St. Louis Brown Stockings by the Chicago White Stockings (today named the Chicago Cubs). With the Chicago White Stockings, he had only 41 at-bats, 4 hits, and 2 RBI. Five years later, the Chicago White Stockings gave away Waitt and he was purchased by the Baltimore Orioles in . He had the most at-bats playing for them, some 250. He was traded to the Philadelphia Quakers in . Waitt played his final baseball game on September 18, 1883.
Death.
Waitt died on October 21, 1912, at age 59. He accidentally fell while washing a window. He was buried in the Sunset Cemetery in San Francisco, California.

Parliament of Whores

Parliament of Whores is an international best-selling political humor book by P. J. O'Rourke published by Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991. Subtitled "A Lone Humorist Attempts to Explain the Entire US Government", "Parliament" is a scathing critique of the American system of governance from a conservative perspective. The hard cover version was a #1 "New York Times" bestseller, sold over 150,000 copies in its first two months of release, and earned over $1 million in revenue in the same time period. "Parliament" reached the top 5 on Canadian best seller lists. The paperback release in 1992 was a similar commercial success.
The book received an overwhelmingly positive critical reception. "Time Magazine" called it "a riotously funny and perceptive indictment of America's political system". "The New York Times" called it "a funnily savage attack on the political authorities of the United States". In a piece about its 1992 paperback release, "USA Today" described it as "the anthem of this political year".

Mananambal

The Mananambal is a Filipino practitioner of traditional medicine; a medicine man who is also capable of performing sorcery. The "mananambal" treats both natural and supernatural maladies.
Etymology.
The appellation "mananambal" is a derivative of the term for the art of "panambal" or "traditional folk healing" in the Philippines, a term used most especially in the islands of Siquijor and Bohol in the Visayas. The term is synonymous with the Tagalog word "albularyo", a type of folk healer.
Methodology.
The "mananambal" uses a combination of traditional practice and Christian beliefs. The amalgamation of folk healing and Christian spiritism may have begun at the onset of the Spanish influence in the Philippines – when Magellan converted the Queen of Cebu to Catholicism. The "mananambal" observed the marked success in exorcism of the Spanish friars and wished for their part to be mediums of the high spirit (the Holy Spirit) that granted the Catholic friars such power.
This link with the Catholic faith is evident in their yearly quest, called "pangalap", for materials used as ingredients in the concoctions for their traditional practice. The "pangalap" begins seven Fridays after Ash Wednesday, prior to the Christian observance of Holy Week. It culminates on Good Friday and Black Saturday. The "mananambal" also uses "orasyones" or "magical prayers".
Pharmacopoeia.
The "mananambal"'s pharmacopoeia is made up of plants (80%), animals (10%) and minerals (10%). 
Rituals.
Some of the rituals observed by the "mananambal" include:
Sorcery.
The powers of sorcery may be gained after a practitioner "learns methods of malign magic and establishes a relationship with a spirit that supports this magic". Some forms of sorcery include:
These forms of sorcery equate with the Tagalog term, "Kulam" and are resistant to the ministrations of Western medicine. Only a "mananambal" can reverse the effects of such sorcery.

Never Enough (Five Finger Death Punch song)

"Never Enough" is a song by American heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch. It was included as a bonus track on the re-release of their debut album, "The Way of the Fist". It was also made available on the band's website to anyone who had purchased the a copy of the original release of the album. It was released as the second single from "The Way of the Fist" on July 15, 2008. The song peaked at number nine on the "Billboard" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. 
Music video.
A video was directed by Agata Alexander.
The video begins showing a black-haired woman with a heavily tattooed man in what seems to be some sort of bondage fetish. The man then leaves in a white car and kisses the woman goodbye. The car is shown stopped somewhere, and a young man gets into the car revealing a handgun. A black Mercedes is shown, and the driver buys drugs from an unknown person (seemingly heroin, as the Mercedes driver is seen torching a spoon with a lighter). The white car is shown pulling up to a gas station, and the two men don ski masks and rob the store. A police car approaches the black Mercedes with its lights on, and the man gets nervous until the cop car quickly drives past him. The man then drives to the gas station held up by the other two men earlier, and the police car that passed the Mercedes is already there. The man approaches the crime scene/caution tape and is stopped by the police, but the man reveals his own badge. A chalk outline is shown on the ground outside the store, but it is not shown who was killed. The woman with the black hair from the beginning of the video is shown looking into a mirror and removing a wig, revealing her natural blonde hair. The young man who brought the gun to the robbery is shown looking depressed on his bed, holding said gun. The man with the badge from the Mercedes puts his badge in a desk drawer and is shown also looking bothered/depressed, and has a picture of the young gunman (his son) on his desk. The video ends showing all three of the characters (woman, young man and cop) eating dinner together; the adulterous wife, the murdering son and the druggie cop are all family, and all seem to wear a facade of everything being normal and ok. The video ends with a family picture being burned.

Kris (Romani court)

Kris () or Kris-Romani is a traditional court for conflict resolution in the culture of Vlax branch of the Romani people. The term derives from the Greek language, "κρίση" (judgment). It is a key institution for enforcing the Romani Code () within Romanipen. It developed in the area of present-day Romania, during the times of the slavery, as a judicial institution of the local Romanies, in order to enforce the community cohesion and its internal balance. After the abolition, from the half of the 19th century onwards, many Vlax Romanies emigrated in the rest of the world, bringing with them the kris as part of their cultural luggage. More or less formal proceedings exist also among other Romani branches. Some non-Vlax Romanies adopted this institution, like the Drzara from Sweden (originally from Serbia), in contact with the local Kalderash.
Proceedings.
The kris covers issues involving only Romani parties, since those involving also non-Romani parties are dealt by non-Romani institutions. In the Romani dispute resolution, it is used as the last resort. Many unsettled issues (if their gravity would not require a kris obviously from the start) are dealt informally through involvement of other members from the local communities. This may take the shape of a "divano", an informal gathering of clan leaders of the conflicting parties and other local influential and respected Romanies (the presence of the parties themselves is optional). If they consider a certain settlement possible, this amounts only to a recommendation. If the parties still do not agree and the issue remains unsettled, the kris is convened as the formal instrument for the dispute resolutions. 
Although customs vary according to local tradition, the basic form of the kris involves the conflicting parties making their appeals to the "krisnitorya" (singular: "krisnitori", also in other variants, "krisnatory", "krisari", "krisatore"), respected Romanies appointed by communal acclamation to preside over the kris. The number of krisnitorya is odd, usually between five and eleven. Other members of the group not directly involved in the conflict may participate by presenting their own statements on the nature of the conflict, or on the character of the involved parties. Formerly, only married males were allowed to argue a case or present evidence at a kris, with females' and unmarried males' interests being represented by their married male relatives. However, nowadays it is more and more common for married women to take an active part in a kris as one of the conflicting parties, or as a witness. In some areas, for example in the USA, women have even begun to serve as "krisnitori". The debates are kept only in Romani language, with a legal register, otherwise unused in the daily speech. In order to enforce the veracity of the communication, various oaths are taken in the name of the ancestors () or other culturally powerful images.
The judgements of the kris are designed to maintain the integrity of the Romani community and uphold the Romanipen. Its proceedings are oriented to reinforce the "kintala" (balance), an important notion of the Romanipen. Considering that there is no absolute truth (as a shame society, in contrast with the usually local non-Romani guilt societies) and each party has its own truth, the krisnitorya seek mainly to restore the mutual respect between the involved parties. Their final decisions should consider a future harmony, since, according to its success and durability in time, the Romani community will consider whether they keep being qualified krisnitorya. If it is concluded that an imbalance happened and its nature and gravity make very difficult restoring the balance with reconciliation, then reparations and punishments are also considered. These may range from fines () paid by the guilty to the injured party, to the guilty party being declared "marime" ('unclean') for a period of time, and banished () from the community. The period of time may be fixed, or until the guilty will pay the fine or will restore a former status quo. The most extreme sentence is for a Romani person to be declared "marime" for all time, and thus permanently excluded from the Romani community, a horrific fate amongst the Roma. In former times, the death sentence was also a possible punishment in some Romani groups, although it is not known to have been practiced for a very long time. If all parties are found guilty and fines are paid, usually these are given to the poor Romanies. Also the punishment may include unpaid work for the local Romani community. The injured party, also in order to reinforce the balance and restore the harmony with the guilty, may renounce a part of the reparations they are entitled to. The decisions of the kris are definitive (there are no higher Romani courts) and they are enforced by the moral pressure of the Romani community.
Kris in non-Romani context.
There are not yet recognitions of the kris from the non-Romani authorities, although there are voices that call for this, reminiscent of the Canadian approach to integrating the Aboriginal courts in its legal system. In Romania, in January 2008, about 500 krisnitorya initiated the "European Committee of the Romani Krisnitorya". In Canada, Romani activist Ronald Lee has sought to use the kris as a way of promoting greater understanding between the Romani and non-Romani communities.
There are also references to the kris in popular culture. For example, in 1997, filmmaker Bence Gyöngyössy made the film "Romani kris - Cigánytörvény", which was also Hungary's submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards that year. In 2007, Laurenţiu Calciu produced the documentary film "Judecătorul – O Krisnitori", about the life of Marin "Sutǎ" Constantin, a krisnitori from the Obreja neighborhood of Târgu Jiu.

<doc id="18457721" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18457721" title="Arthropod exoskeleton">
Arthropod exoskeleton

Arthropods are covered with a tough or resistant exoskeleton, which may be mineralised or constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin, and is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. This external skeleton is moulted as the organism grows.
Microscopic structure.
A typical arthropod exoskeleton is a multi-layered structure with four functional regions: epicuticle, procuticle, epidermis and basement membrane. Of these, the epicuticle is a multi-layered external barrier that, especially in terrestrial arthropods, acts as a barrier against desiccation. The strength of the exoskeleton is provided by the underlying procuticle, which is in turn secreted by the epidermis. Arthropod cuticle is a biological composite material, consisting of two main portions: fibrous chains of alpha-chitin within a matrix of silk-like and globular proteins, of which the most well-known is the rubbery protein called resilin. The relative abundance of these two main components varies from approximately 50/50 to 80/20 chitin protein, with softer parts of the exoskeleton having a higher proportion of chitin. Although the cuticle is relatively soft when first secreted, it soon hardens in a poorly understood process that involves sclerotization and/or tanning mediated by hydrophobic chemicals called phenolics. Different types of interaction between the proteins and chitin leads to varying mechanical properties of the exoskeleton.
In addition to the chitino-proteinaceous composite of the cuticle, many crustaceans, some myriapods and the extinct trilobites further impregnate the cuticle with mineral salts, above all calcium carbonate, which can make up up to 40% of the cuticle. This can lead to great mechanical strength.
Mechanical properties.
The two layers of the cuticle have different properties.
The outer, sclerosed layer is very strong under compressive forces, but much weaker under tension. When it fails, it does so by cracking. The inner layer is not sclerosed, and is thus much softer; it is able to resist tensile forces but is liable to failure under compression. 
This combination is especially effective in resisting predation, as predators tend to exert compression on the outer layer, and tension on the inner.
The degree of scleritisation affects how the cuticle responds to deformation. Below a certain point - and this point will be higher the more scleritised the cuticle is - deformation is elastic and the original shape is returned to after the stress is removed. Above this point, plastic (non-reversible) deformation occurs until finally the cuticle cracks.
Segmentation.
The arthropod exoskeleton is typically divided into different functional units to allow flexibility in an often otherwise rigid structure. For example, the head is a fused capsule; and the trunk is often divided into a series of articulating sclerites called tergites. In addition, the characteristic limbs of arthropods need to be jointed. The internal surface of the exoskeleton is often elaborated into a set of specialised structures called apodemes that allow the attachment of muscles. Such endoskeletal components of the arthropod skeleton can be highly complex, as in crabs and lobsters.
Ecdysis.
The relative rigidity of the exoskeleton means that continuous growth of arthropods is not possible. Therefore, growth is periodic and concentrated into a period of time when the exoskeleton is shed, called moulting or ecdysis, which is under the control of a hormone called ecdysone. Moulting is a complex process that is invariably dangerous for the arthropod involved. Before the old exoskeleton is shed, the cuticle separates from the epidermis through a process called apolysis. New cuticle is excreted by the underlying epidermis, and mineral salts are usually withdrawn from the old cuticle for re-use. After the old cuticle is shed, the arthropod typically pumps up its body (for example, by air or water intake) to allow the new cuticle to expand to a larger size: the process of hardening by dehydration of the cuticle then takes place. Newly molted arthropods typically appear pale or white, and darken as the cuticle hardens.

Churruca-class destroyer

Churruca was a Spanish destroyer class built for the Spanish Navy based on a British design. Eighteen ships were built, two sold to Argentina.
The ships were authorized on 17 February 1915 by Navy Minister Augusto Miranda y Godoy. The program planned for four light cruisers, six destroyers, 28 submarines, three gunboats, and 18 coast guard vessels; of these, five light cruisers, three "Alsedo"- and fourteen "Churruca"-class destroyers, 16 submarines, and the three gunboats were actually completed.
Some of the later ships of the class were completed without the central gun due to an arms embargo during the Spanish Civil War.
History.
The three first ships ("Churruca", "Alcalá Galiano", and "Sánchez Barcáiztegui") were launched between May 1925 and June 1926. When "Plus Ultra" went to Argentina, she was accompanied by "Méndez Núñez" and "Alsedo". These vessels arrived in Buenos Aires on 7 February 1926. The Argentine Navy was interested in purchasing "Alsedo", and the Spanish government on 25 May 1927 provided credit to buy ships in Spain. Argentina eventually purchased "Churruca" and "Alcalá Galiano", renaming them "Cervantes" and "Juan de Garay".
Between 1928 and 1933, "Churruca" and "Alcalá Galiano" were launched, along with four other vessels, followed by seven more between 1935 and 1937.
Spanish Civil War.
At the start of the Spanish Civil War, the class served on the Spanish Republican Navy and blockaded the Gibraltar Strait. Class members saw some action. "Almirante Ferrándiz" and "Gravina" took part in the Battle of Cape Espartel, where the "Almirante Ferrándiz" was sunk by the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias". "Lepanto", "Almirante Valdes", "Almirante Antequera", "Gravina", "Jorge Juan", and "Escaño" participated in the Battle of Cape Cherchell. "Lepanto", "Sánchez Barcaiztegui", "Almirante Miranda" and "Grafina" were engaged in the Battle of Cape Palos, where "Lepanto" sank the Nationalist cruiser "Baleares" with torpedoes. "Ciscar" was sunk by aircraft in Gijon harbour, refloated by the rebels, and used by them in the final phases of the war.
One member of the class, due to her strong resemblance to a British destroyer, was used in an attempt to break the blockade of the Gibraltar Strait and return to the Mediterranean Sea after the fall of the Republican government in the north of Spain in 1938. "José Luis Díez", painted with the pennant number of HMS "Grenville", was intercepted by "Canarias" and other ships, and beached herself in Gibraltar.
When the Spanish Civil War ended, the class was turned over to the Nationalists.
The last two ships were commissioned in 1951, updated with only 4 guns but quadruple rather than triple torpedo tubes, Q gun being landed as weight compensation.
Ships.
Argentinian Navy Service.
The "Churruca" and The "Alcalá Galiano" were sold to the Argentine Navy while under construction. They were named ARA "Cervantes" (E1) and ARA "Juan de Garay" (named after Juan de Garay) respectively. The ships were commissioned on 3 September 1927 and modernised after World War II. The modernisation involved removing the midships 120mm gun and the 3 inch gun and replacing these weapons with 40mm Bofors guns. These were Swedish built weapons in hand-worked twin mountings with air-cooled barrels and locally controlled, not the more familiar director-controlled, water-cooled and power operated mountings popularized by the U.S. Navy, British Royal Navy and others. The "Cervantes" was severely damaged by Gloster Meteor fighters loyal to Juan Domingo Perón while evacuating personnel from the rebel naval base of Rio Santiago during the 1955 Revolución Libertadora. The ships were decommissioned in 1961 and 1960 respectively.

MONECS

MONECS (Monash University Educational Computing System) was a computer operating system with BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal compilers, plus machine language facility. Specifically designed for computer science education in Australian secondary schools and at the university undergraduate level. 
Alternative designations were DEAMON (Digital Equipment Australia - Monash University) or SCUBA (local designation at Melbourne University) systems. 
For teaching computer science students in Australian schools Monash University created subsets of the FORTRAN language, an elementary version called MINITRAN then an enhanced version called MIDITRAN. MIDITRAN versions were available for a number of different mainframe systems, i.e. Burroughs B5000/B5500 series, CDC 3000, IBM 360 and ICL 1900. Student's programs were submitted on IBM Port-a-Punch cards that can be programmed with an IBM board and stylus or even a bent paper clip. Standard 80-column punch cards were an option for students if a card punch was available.
Before the personal computer, it was impossible for a class of Australian students to have hands-on access to a computer within a one hour school period. Mainframes were too expensive for small schools and remote job entry equipment was typically limited to major corporations, universities and research centres. 
A group at Monash University under the leadership of Dr Len G. Whitehouse solved the problem with a small PDP-11 minicomputer system that could be used in the classroom. Mark sense cards were used, and a class of 30 children could each get two runs in a one hour period. The Monash University series of Student FORTRAN predated and was an independent effort not associated with DEC's PDP-8 based EDUSYSTEM series which centred on the BASIC language.
MONECS was optimised for the low end hardware of the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11 minicomputer family. Typical installation would be a PDP-11/03, /04, /05 /10 or D. D. Webster Electronics' Spectrum-IIB (repackaged DEC LSI) processor with 32k Bytes memory.
MONECS systems were based on the PDP-11/05 or PDP-11/10 processors with core memory. This was identical hardware rebadged by the manufacturer DEC just to indicate an OEM version. Student systems were fitted with a custom UNIBUS interface to support the Memorex 651 flexible drive which was an early version of an 8 inch floppy disk.
Next major releases were the DEAMON systems based on PDP-11/04 or PDP/11/34 processors with semiconductor memory and DEC RX01 8-inch floppy disk drive(s). Then the LSI-11 systems based systems which moved away from the UNIBUS based processors and used the PDP-11/03 and Spectrum-IIB systems.
All systems were installed with a mark sense card reader PDI, Hewlett-Packard or Documation M-200, plus a 132 column lineprinter from Tally, DEC, etc.
Student programs were typically submitted as a deck of mark sense cards although punched cards were an option. Due to the 32k Byte memory constraint MONECS serially processed student programs with all jobs queued in the input hopper of the cardreader. The appropriate language interpreter was loaded from the floppy disk for each job and the results printed before reading in the next student's program.
The MONECS systems were supported by staff from the Monash University Computer Centre which was an entity independent from the Computer Science Department. The Computer Centre shared facilities and staff with the Victorian Hospitals Computing Service (HCS). The Computer Centre also processed mark-sense sheets on an ICL 1800 series reader for the Victorian Education Department's Secondary Students final (year 12) examinations.

Giant hawkfish

The giant hawkfish, "Cirrhitus rivulatus" is a species of hawkfish. It is a marine fish and the largest of the hawkfish family with maximum size of in total length. It is known for its social behavior towards scuba divers and its uncanny ability to perch on its pectoral fins. This particular species can be found mainly along the Sea of Cortez, at the Gulf of California, reaching as far as northern Colombia and the Galapagos Islands. It is a predator, mostly feeding on other small fish and crustaceans.
Observation.
The giant hawkfish has a unique body design, mostly deep and compressed, with a mainly olive skin tone sporting golden stripes or bars. It is a favorite fish to observe amongst scuba diving enthusiasts diving along the Pacific coasts of Mexico. Usually remaining motionless, it inhabits large boulders and rocky outcroppings at offshore islands, including Isla San Pedro Nolasco near San Carlos, and Isla Tiburón near Bahía Kino. Mainly occupying shallow waters not unfamiliar to high wave activity, like other hawkfishes, it has a reputation for being able to perch on one of its pectoral fins, and sometimes both, perhaps obtaining its name from this. It has displayed the ability to stand up completely on its tail fin in aquaria. In the ocean, its pectoral fins serve a more a valuable purpose other than for swimming, being strong enough to lock it between rocks subject to wave surge. It is not uncommon to anglers around their native region and is known to be a game fish.

Girolamo Priuli (1486–1567)

Girolamo Priuli (1486 in Venice – 4 November 1567 in Venice) was a Venetian noble, who served as the eighty-third Doge of Venice, from 1 September 1559 until his sudden death from a stroke. He was the elder brother of the preceding doge, Lorenzo Priuli. Girolamo's face is familiar from Tintoretto's portrait.
Girolamo was the son of Alvise Peruli and his wife Chiara Lion. As a man of culture he seemed insignificant in relation to his brother; ineloquent, he was at first scarcely popular but gained respect through the works embellishing the city that he achieved as doge, in a period, above all, of peace for the "Repubblica Serenissima".
His early career established him as an able merchant, though not among the most prominent. He served as "procuratore di San Marco". 
His marriage with Elena Diedo produced a son.

Frink School

The Frink School of Figurative Sculpture was named after Elisabeth Frink (1930–1993), British Sculptor, and was a small intimate academy with a specific discipline of study closer in spirit to a "master and apprentice" structure than an educational institution. It was directed by the British sculptor Rosemary Barnett; other artists involved in its educational role included Harry Everington, Alan Thornhill and Ken Ford.
Its prime aim and charitable purpose was to provide an education in the observational and technical disciplines of figurative sculpture and to support and encourage the creative potential revealed in the process.
Everington met Barnett in 1990 at the Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture in Stoke on Trent. When, in 1993, the funding was removed from the Doulton School, they both set about establishing a successor to it, which would try to give some balance to the trend towards conceptual work in sculpture schools. The school covered every aspect of figurative sculpture, including welding, carving in wood and stone, letter cutting, mould-making and casting – in addition to modelling in clay. 
The Frink School opened in 1996 in Longton, moving to Tunstall in 1999. It initially ran a two-year full-time course, with about 4–9 students entered the School per year. It ceased running full-time courses in 2005.
The tutorial direction was more concerned with revelation in sculpture than its viability in the art market or the gallery. For two years of their lives, the members of this community were expected to search with perception and imagination and find sculptural means to express that which they could discover. It was expected that this would serve them for the rest for their lives.
The Patron of the School was Lin Jammet, Lis Frink's son.

Mollusc shell

The mollusc (or mollusk) shell is typically a calcareous exoskeleton which encloses, supports and protects the soft parts of an animal in the phylum Mollusca, which includes snails, clams, tusk shells, and several other classes. Not all shelled molluscs live in the sea, many live on the land and in freshwater.
The ancestral mollusc is thought to have had a shell, but this has subsequently been lost or reduced on some families, such as the squid, octopus, and some smaller groups such as the caudofoveata and solenogastres, and the highly derived "Xenoturbella". Today, over 100,000 living species bear a shell; there is some dispute as to whether these shell-bearing molluscs form a monophyletic group (conchifera) or whether shell-less molluscs are interleaved into their family tree.
Malacology, the scientific study of molluscs as living organisms, has a branch devoted to the study of shells, and this is called conchology - although these terms used to be, and to a minor extent still are, used interchangeably, even by scientists (this is more common in Europe).
Within some species of molluscs there is often a surprising degree of variation in the exact shape, pattern, ornamentation, and color of the shell.
Formation.
A mollusc shell is formed, repaired and maintained by a part of the anatomy called the mantle. Any injuries to or abnormal conditions of the mantle are usually reflected in the shape and form and even color of the shell. When the animal encounters harsh conditions that limit its food supply, or otherwise cause it to become dormant for a while, the mantle often ceases to produce the shell substance. When conditions improve again and the mantle resumes its task, a "growth line" is produced.
The mantle edge secretes a shell which has two components. The organic constituent is mainly made up of polysaccharides and glycoproteins; its composition may vary widely: some molluscs employ a wide range of chitin-control genes to create their matrix, whereas others just express one, suggesting that the role of chitin in the shell framework is highly variable; it may even be absent in monoplacophora. This organic framework controls the formation of calcium carbonate crystals, (never phosphate with the questionable exception of "Cobcrephora"), and dictates when and where crystals start and stop growing, and how fast they expand; it even controls the polymorph of the crystal deposited, controlling positioning and elongation of crystals and preventing their growth where appropriate.
The shell formation requires certain biological machinery. The shell is deposited within a small compartment, the extrapallial space, which is sealed from the environment by the periostracum, a leathery outer layer around the rim of the shell, where growth occurs. This caps off the extrapallial space, which is bounded on its other surfaces by the existing shell and the mantle. The periostracum acts as a framework from which the outer layer of carbonate can be suspended, but also, in sealing the compartment, allows the accumulation of ions in concentrations sufficient for crystallization to occur. The accumulation of ions is driven by ion pumps packed within the calcifying epithelium. Calcium ions are obtained from the organism's environment through the gills, gut and epithelium, transported by the haemolymph ("blood") to the calcifying epithelium, and stored as granules within or in-between cells ready to be dissolved and pumped into the extrapallial space when they are required. The organic matrix forms the scaffold that directs crystallization, and the deposition and rate of crystals is also controlled by hormones produced by the mollusc. Because the extrapallial space is supersaturated, the matrix could be thought of as impeding, rather than encouraging, carbonate deposition; although it does act as a nucleating point for the crystals and controls their shape, orientation and polymorph, it also terminates their growth once they reach the necessary size. Nucleation is endoepithelial in "Neopilina" and "Nautilus", but exoepithelial in the bivalves and gastropods.
The formation of the shell involves a number of genes and transcription factors. On the whole, the transcription factors and signalling genes are deeply conserved, but the proteins in the secretome are highly derived and rapidly evolving. "engrailed" serves to demark the edge of the shell field; "dpp" controls the shape of the shell, and "Hox1" and "Hox4" have been implicated in the onset of mineralization. In gastropod embryos, "Hox1" is expressed where the shell is being accreted; however no association has been observed between "Hox" genes and cephalopod shell formation. Perlucin increases the rate at which calcium carbonate precipitates to form a shell when in saturated seawater; this protein is from the same group of proteins (C-type lectins) as those responsible for the formation of eggshell and pancreatic stone crystals, but the role of C-type lectins in mineralization is unclear. Perlucin operates in association with Perlustrin, a smaller relative of lustrin A, a protein responsible for the elasticity of organic layers that makes nacre so resistant to cracking. Lustrin A bears remarkable structural similarity to the proteins involved in mineralization in diatoms – even though diatoms use silica, not calcite, to form their tests!
Development.
The shell-secreting area is differentiated very early in embryonic development. An area of the ectoderm thickens, then invaginates to become a "shell gland". The shape of this gland is tied to the form of the adult shell; in gastropods, it is a simple pit, whereas in bivalves, it forms a groove which will eventually become the hinge line between the two shells, where they are connected by a ligament. The gland subsequently evaginates in molluscs that produce an external shell. Whilst invaginated, a periostracum - which will form a scaffold for the developing shell - is formed around the opening of the invagination, allowing the deposition of the shell when the gland is everted. A wide range of enzymes are expressed during the formation of the shell, including carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase, and DOPA-oxidase (tyrosinase)/peroxidase.
The form of the molluscan shell is constrained by the organism's ecology. In molluscs whose ecology changes from the larval to adult form, the morphology of the shell also undergoes a pronounced modification at metamorphosis. The larval shell may have a completely different mineralogy to the adult conch, perhaps formed from amorphous calcite as opposed to an aragonite adult conch.
In those shelled molluscs that have indeterminate growth, the shell grows steadily over the lifetime of the mollusc by the addition of calcium carbonate to the leading edge or opening. Thus the shell gradually becomes longer and wider, in an increasing spiral shape, to better accommodate the growing animal inside. The shell thickens as it grows, so that it stays proportionately strong for its size.
Secondary loss.
The loss of a shell in the adult form of some gastropods is achieved by the discarding of the larval shell; in other gastropods and in cephalopods, the shell is lost or demineralized by the resorption of its carbonate component by the mantle tissue.
Shell proteins.
Hundreds of soluble and insoluble proteins, control shell formation. They are secreted into the extrapallial space by the mantle, which also secretes the glycoproteins, proteoglycans, polysaccharides and chitin that make up the organic shell matrix. Insoluble proteins tend to be thought of as playing a more important/major role in crystallization control. The organic matrix of shells tends to consist of β-chitin and silk fibroin. Perlucin encourages carbonate deposition, and is found at the interface of the chitinous and aragonitic layer in some shells. An acidic shell matrix appears to be essential to shell formation, in the cephalopods at least; the matrix in the non-mineralized squid gladius is basic.
In oysters and potentially most molluscs, the nacreous layer has an organic framework of the protein MSI60, which has a structure a little like spider silk and forms sheets; the prismatic layer uses MSI31 to construct its framework. This too forms beta-pleated sheets. Since acidic amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, are important mediators of biomineralization, shell proteins tend to be rich in these amino acids. Aspartic acid, which can make up up to 50% of shell framework proteins, is most abundant in calcitic layers, and also heavily present in aragonitic layers. Proteins with high proportions of glutamic acid are usually associated with amorphous calcium carbonate.
The soluble component of the shell matrix acts to inhibit crystallization when in its soluble form, but when it attaches to an insoluble substrate, it permits the nucleation of crystals. By switching from a dissolved to an attached form and back again, the proteins can produce 'bursts' of growth, producing the brick-wall structure of the shell.
Chemistry.
The formation of a shell in molluscs appears to be related to the secretion of ammonia, which originates from urea. The presence of an ammonium ion raises the pH of the extrapallial fluid, favouring the deposition of calcium carbonate. This mechanism has been proposed not only for molluscs, but also for other unrelated mineralizing lineages.
Structure.
The calcium carbonate layers in a shell are generally of two types: an outer, chalk-like prismatic layer and an inner pearly, lamellar or nacreous layer. The layers usually incorporate a substance called conchiolin, often in order to help bind the calcium carbonate crystals together. Conchiolin is composed largely of quinone-tanned proteins.
The periostracum and prismatic layer are secreted by a marginal band of cells, so that the shell grows at its outer edge. Conversely, the nacreous layer is derived from the main surface of the mantle.
Some shells contain pigments which are incorporated into the structure. This is what accounts for the striking colors and patterns that can be seen in some species of seashells, and the shells of some tropical land snails. These shell pigments sometimes include compounds such as pyrroles and porphyrins.
Shells are almost always composed of polymorphs of calcium carbonate - either calcite or aragonite. In many cases, such as the shells of many of the marine gastropods, different layers of the shell are composed of calcite and aragonite. In a few species which dwell near hydrothermal vents, iron sulfide is used to construct the shell. Phosphate is never utilised by molluscs, with the exception of "Cobcrephora", whose molluscan affinity is uncertain.
Shells are composite materials of calcium carbonate (found either as calcite or aragonite) and organic macromolecules (mainly proteins and polysaccharides.) Shells can have numerous ultrastructural motifs, the most common being crossed-lamellar (aragonite), prismatic (aragonite or calcite), homogeneous (aragonite), foliated (aragonite) and nacre (aragonite). Although not the most common, nacre is the most studied type of layer. Shells of the class Polyplacophora are made of aragonite.
Size.
In most shelled molluscs, the shell is large enough for all of the soft parts to be retracted inside when necessary, for protection from predation or from desiccation. However there are many species of gastropod mollusc in which the shell is somewhat reduced or considerably reduced, such that it offers some degree of protection only to the visceral mass, but is not large enough to allow the retraction of the other soft parts. This is particularly common in the opisthobranchs and in some of the pulmonates, for example in the semi-slugs.
Some gastropods have no shell at all, or only an internal shell or internal calcareous granules, and these species are often known as slugs. Semislugs are pulmonate slugs with a greatly reduced external shell which is in some cases partly covered by the mantle.
Shape.
The shape of the molluscan shell is controlled both by transcription factors (such as engrailed and decapentaplegic) and by developmental rate. The simplification of a shall form is thought to be relatively easily evolved, and many gastropod lineages have independently lost the complex coiled shape. However, re-gaining the coiling requires many morphological modifications and is much rarer. Despite this, it can still be accomplished; it is known from one lineage that was uncoiled for at least 20 million years, before modifying its developmental timing to restore the coiled morphology.
In bivalves at least, the shape does change through growth, but the pattern of growth is constant. At each point around the aperture of the shell, the rate of growth remains constant. This results in different areas growing at different rates, and thus a coiling of the shell and a change in its shape - its convexity, and the shape of the opening - in a predictable and consistent fashion.
The shape of the shell has an environmental as well as a genetic component; clones of gastropods can exert different shell morphologies. Indeed intra-species variation can be many times larger than inter-species variation.
A number of terms are used to describe molluscan shell shape; in the univalved molluscs, endogastric shells coil backwards (away from the head), whereas exogastric shells coil forwards; the equivalent terms in bivalved molluscs are opisthogyrate and prosogyrate respectively.
Nacre.
Nacre, commonly known as mother of pearl, forms the inner layer of the shell structure in some groups of gastropod and bivalve molluscs, mostly in the more ancient families such as top snails (Trochidae), and pearl oysters (Pteriidae). Like the other calcareous layers of the shell, the nacre is created by the epithelial cells (formed by the germ layer ectoderm) of the mantle tissue.
However, nacre does not seem to represent a modification of other shell types, as it uses a distinct set of proteins.
Evolution.
The fossil record shows that all molluscan classes evolved some 500 million years ago from a shelled ancestor looking something like a modern monoplacophoran, and that modifications of the shell form ultimately led to the formation of new classes and lifestyles. However, a growing body of molecular and biological data indicate that at least certain shell features have evolved many times, independently. The nacreous layer of shells is a complex structure, but rather than being difficult to evolve, it has in fact arisen many times convergently. The genes used to control its formation vary greatly between taxa: under 10% of the (non-housekeeping) genes expressed in the shells that produce gastropod nacre are also found in the equivalent shells of bivalves: and most of these shared genes are also found in mineralizing organs in the deuterostome lineage. The independent origins of this trait are further supported by crystallographic differences between clades: the orientation of the axes of the deposited aragonite 'bricks' that make up the nacreous layer is different in each of the monoplacophora, gastropods and bivalves.
Mollusc shells (especially those formed by marine species) are very durable and outlast the otherwise soft-bodied animals that produce them by a very long time (sometimes thousands of years even without being fossilized). Most shells of marine molluscs fossilize rather easily, and fossil mollusc shells date all the way back to the Cambrian period. Large amounts of shells sometimes form sediment, and over a geological time span can become compressed into limestone deposits.
Most of the fossil record of molluscs consists of their shells, since the shell is often the only mineralised part of a mollusc (however also see Aptychus and operculum). The shells are usually preserved as calcium carbonate – usually any aragonite is pseudomorphed with calcite. Aragonite can be protected from recrystalization if water is kept away by carbonaceous material, but this did not accumulate in sufficient quantity until the Carboniferous; consequently aragonite older than the Carboniferous is practically unknown: but the original crystal structure can sometimes be deduced in fortunate circumstances, such as if an alga closely encrusts the surface of a shell, or if a phosphatic mould quickly forms during diagenesis.
The shell-less aplacophora have a chitinous cuticle that has been likened to the shell framework; it has been suggested that tanning of this cuticle, in conjunction with the expression of additional proteins, could have set the evolutionary stage for the secretion of a calcareous shell in an aplacophoran-like ancestral mollusc.
The molluscan shell has been internalized in a number of lineages, including the coleoid cephalopods and many gastropod lineages. Detorsion of gastropods results in an internal shell, and can be triggered by relatively minor developmental modifications such as those induced by exposure to high platinum concentrations.
Varieties.
Monoplacophora.
The nacreous layer of monoplacophoran shells appears to have undergone some modification. Whilst normal nacre, and indeed part of the nacreous layer of one monoplacophoran species ("Veleropilina zografi"), consists of "brick-like" crystals of aragonite, in monoplacophora these bricks are more like layered sheets. The "c-"axis is perpendicular to the shell wall, and the "a"-axis parallel to the growth direction. This foliated aragonite is presumed to have evolved from the nacreous layer, with which it has historically been confused, but represents a novelty within the molluscs.
Chitons.
Shells of chitons are made up of eight overlapping calcareous valves, surrounded by a girdle.
Gastropods.
In some marine genera, during the course of normal growth the animal undergoes periodic resting stages where the shell does not increase in overall size, but a greatly thickened and strengthened lip is produced instead. When these structures are formed repeatedly with normal growth between the stages, evidence of this pattern of growth is visible on the outside of the shell, and these unusual thickened vertical areas are called "varices", singular "varix". Varices are typical in some marine gastropod families, including the Bursidae, Muricidae, and Ranellidae.
Finally, gastropods with a determinate growth pattern may create a single and terminal lip structure when approaching maturity, after which growth ceases. These include the cowries (Cypraeidae) and helmet shells (Cassidae), both with in-turned lips, the true conchs (Strombidae) that develop flaring lips, and many land snails that develop tooth structures or constricted apertures upon reaching full size.
Cephalopods.
Nautiluses are the only extant cephalopods which have an external shell. (For information on a very large extinct subclass of shelled cephalopods, please see Ammonites.) Cuttlefish, squid, spirula, vampire squid, and cirrate octopuses have small internal shells. Females of the octopus genus "Argonauta" secrete a specialised paper-thin eggcase in which they partially reside, and this is popularly regarded as a "shell", although it is not attached to the body of the animal.
Bivalves.
The shell of the Bivalvia is composed of two parts, two valves which are hinged together and joined by a ligament.
Scaphopods.
The shell of many of the scaphopods ("tusk shells") resembles a miniature elephant's tusk in overall shape, except that it is hollow, and is open at both ends.
Damage to shells in collections.
As a structure made primarily of calcium carbonate, mollusc shells are vulnerable to attack by acidic fumes. This can become a problem when shells are in storage or on display and are in the proximity of non-archival materials, see Byne's disease.

Lists of The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers

This is a list of "The New York Times" Non-Fiction Best Sellers. 
"The New York Times" Best Seller list was first published without fanfare on October 12, 1931. It consisted of five fiction and four non-fiction for the New York City region only. The following month the list was expanded to eight cities, with a separate list for each city. By the early 1940s, fourteen cities were included. A national list was created April 9, 1942 in "The New York Times Book Review" (Sundays) as a supplement to the regular paper's city lists (Monday edition). The national list ranked by weighting how many times the book appeared in each city list. A few years later, the city lists were eliminated leaving only the national rankings, which was compiled according to "reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities," a system which remains essentially unchanged to this day (though the specifics have changed).
A separate category for "Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous" books was created January 1, 1984. Its number one bestseller ("The Body Principal" by Victoria Principal) had been number ten and number twelve on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks.

Baker Street Mill, Orsett

Baker Street Mill is a grade II listed smock mill at Baker Street, Orsett, Essex, England which has been part adapted to residential use on its lower two floors only.
History.
Baker Street Mill is said to have been built in 1765, although a date of 1762 is recorded in the mill. The earliest firm reference for the mill is 1796, this from a sale notice in 1808. It is likely that the mill was raised a storey between 1762 and 1814. The mill was working by wind until 1914. A steam mill was built near the mill towards the end of its working life, a new boiler being supplied in 1906.
The mill gradually became more and more derelict, losing two sails in 1926 to a lightning strike. The windmill and steam mill were converted to residential accommodation in 1982.
Description.
Baker Street Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a two-storey brick base, with a stage at first-floor level. The mill had four double patent sails, and the Kentish-style cap is winded by a fantail.
Mill.
Baker Street Mill has an octagonal two-storey brick base, the walls of which are almost thick at ground level. The base is across the flats and high, the brickwork at the top of the base is about thick.
The smock is from sill to curb. The mill is diameter at the curb, the cant posts being about square. The stage is at first-floor level, above the ground.
The cap is of Kentish style, with blisters for the brake wheel, with an overall height of some , giving the mill an overall height of about . Winding is by an eight-bladed fantail, although originally the mill was winded by hand.
Sails and windshaft.
Baker Street Mill has a cast-iron windshaft and four double patent sails. The windshaft was originally a wooden one. The last working sails were an odd pair, the outer pair having eight bays of four shutters and one bay of three, the inner pair having eleven bays of three shutters.
Machinery.
The wooden brake wheel is of clasp arm construction, diameter. It has been converted from compass arm construction. The rim is of elm. The Wallower is wooden, as is the upright shaft. The compass arm great spur wheel is diameter, and has six arms. The mill originally worked two pairs of overdrift millstones, with a third pair being added later.
Fantail.
Baker Street Mill was winded by an eight-bladed fantail, replacing the original hand winding by means of a Y wheel and chain, which was retained as a standby method of winding the mill.

Ganaxolone

Ganaxolone (INN, also known as CCD-1042) is a synthetic neuroactive steroid related to allopregnanolone that has sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects. It is a potent and selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Ganaxolone protects against seizures in diverse animal models, including the pentylenetetrazol, 6 Hz and amygdala kindling models. Unlike for benzodiazepines, there is no tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of ganaxolone 
Ganaxolone is being investigated for potential medical use in the treatment of epilepsy. It is well tolerated in human trials (with exposure of >900 patients), with the main side-effects being sedation, dizziness, and headache. Trials in adults with partial seizures and in infantile spasms have recently been completed.

Phyllocrania paradoxa

Phyllocrania paradoxa, common name Ghost Mantis, is a small species of mantis from Africa remarkable for its leaf-like body. It is one of the three species in the genus "Phyllocrania".
Description.
Compared to many other praying mantises, the Ghost Mantis is a "miniature species" growing to only about long.
It comes in various brownish shades from very dark brown (almost black) to greenish gray. An individual's colors change between molts and are also dependent on light and humidity levels.
"Phyllocrania paradoxa" is camouflaged so as to appear as dead, dried-up leaf material. It has an elongated head, a flattened, extended prothorax (together referred to as its "elaborate headdress and shoulder shields" by one enthusiast), and leaf-like protrusions from its limbs. The mantis also has a forewing that looks like a desiccated leaf, and the "creases" in the wings are actually shadings of pigment.
"P. paradoxa" oothecae can hatch out up to three dozen young. 1st and 2nd instar nymphs of this species are dark colored and use ant mimicry as a defense.
Sexual Dimorphism.
As with most or all species of mantis, "Phyllocrania paradoxa" is sexually dimorphic, with females being larger than males. Females have six abdominal segments. Males are shorter, narrower, and have eight-segmented abdomens. At the 5th instar and above males are thinner than females and have smaller appendages (lateral of the abdomen). At the 6th instar and above their crowns are different. When adult, males have longer and thicker antennae than females and have transparent wings, which are longer than the abdomen and are good flyers and are significant thinner than the females. At the 5th instar and above females are more compact than males and have bigger appendages. At the 6th instar and above the crown of females are as wide as their head and more line and smoother than the male`s crown. When adult, females are significantly more compact than the male with shorter antennae and the wings cover the abdomen.
Range.
"Phyllocrania paradoxa" have a wide range across the African continent and its islands and can be found in Angola, South Europe, Cameroon, Cape Province, Congo basin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malawi, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Transvaal, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
Habitat.
Ghost Mantids inhabit dry areas, bushes, shrubbes, trees in the open.
In Captivity.
The Ghost Mantis is one of the most popular species of mantis in the mantis hobby because it looks good, is very easy to keep, it is relatively long-lived and are not very aggressive toward each unlike many praying mantises so older nymphs can be kept together without problem and they should be separated around pre-sub-adult. Female Ghost Mantii can live up to eight months as adults while males live a much shorter life.

Terling Windmill

Terling Windmill is a grade II listed Smock mill at Terling, Essex, England which has been converted to residential use.
History.
"Terling Windmill" was built here c1818. It is said to have been originally built at Cressing c1770, but this has neither been proved nor disproved. Originally it was a bark mill, but was advertised for sale in 1818 as “new built” and “may be converted to corn grinding at an inconsiderable expense” The mill may have been built here by Chappell, a millwright from Witham.
The mill was painted white until 1929 when the smock was tarred. In 1935, the mill was damaged in a gale and lost its fantail. A new pair of sails from Button's Mill, Diss, Norfolk was fitted in the 1930s. They were brough from Diss by rail and then horse and cart. The mill was working by wind until 1949, and afterwards by external power. On 30 August 1950, the miller was trapped in the machinery and killed, despite the best efforts of the fire brigade to rescue him. Thus the working life of the mill ended. The mill was house converted in 1970, with the major machinery being retained, and its external appearance restored.
Description.
"Terling Windmill" is a four-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. A stage was not used. The mill had four double Patent sails and the domed cap was winded by a fantail. When the mill was working, it had a tarred smock with a white cap. After conversion, the mill was painted white, with the cap clad in aluminium sheets.
Mill.
"Terling Windmill" has an octagonal single-storey brick base. The walls of which are thick at ground level. The base is across the flats and high. The brickwork at the top of the base is about thick.
The smock shows signs of having been dismantled and transported in sections at some point, with the cant posts being newer than the framing. The tower is to the curb, and the domed cap rises above the curb to the underside of the finial, giving the mill an overall height of about .
Sails and windshaft.
"Terling Windmill" has a cast-iron windshaft and four double Patent sails. The last working pair of sails came from Button's Mill, Diss, Norfolk, having originally been on the post mill at Mount Pleasant, Framlingham, Suffolk. They had a span of and were wide. The sails now on the mill have a span of .
Machinery.
The wooden Brake Wheel is of clasp arm construction, diameter, with 96 cogs. This drives an iron Wallower of with 47 cogs. At the lower end of the long wooden Upright Shaft is the clasp arm Great Spur Wheel, which has 108 cogs, and drove three pairs of millstones. The two pairs of French Burr stones being driven by Stone Nuts with 26 cogs, whilst the Peak stones were driven by a Stone Nut with 25 cogs.
Fantail.
"Terling Windmill" was winded by an eight-bladed fantail, driving an iron worm on the curb.

Moses Pitt

Moses Pitt (c. 1639–1697) was a bookseller and printer known for the production of his "Atlas" of the world, a project supported by the Royal Society, and in particular by Christopher Wren. He is also known as the author of "The Cry of the Oppressed" (1691), an account of the conditions in which imprisoned debtors lived in debtors' jails in England.
__TOC__
Early life.
Pitt originated from St Teath, Cornwall, and began publishing in 1667 from his base in Little Britain, London.
Publications.
His work was characterised by its learned content and included authors such as Robert Boyle and Gilbert Burnet. His "Atlas" was initially intended to be 12 volumes and he continued to undertake other work for the Royal Society. However rising costs, estimated by Pitt at £1000 per volume, contributed to his eventual bankruptcy and only four volumes were ever produced.
In Ireland William Molyneux collaborated with Roderic O'Flaherty to collect material for the "Atlas". While Pitt's financial crisis lead to cancellation of the project, much valuable work on early Irish history was collected. Molyneux and O'Flaherty struck a friendship and Molyneux assisted when the latter's treatise "Ogygia" was published in London in 1685.
As a result of the Atlas project, Pitt was declared bankrupt. He was taken to the Fleet Prison, and remained there, or in the King's Bench Prison, for seven years. In 1691, he published "The Cry of the Oppressed: Being a True and Tragical Account of the Unparallel'd Sufferings of Multitudes of Poor Imprison'd Debtors In Most of the Gaols in England", a moving appeal on behalf of prisoners for debt across the country.

Ariane Friedrich, born Tempel (born 10 January 1984 in Nordhausen) is a German high jumper. She won the bronze medal at the 2009 World Championships and represented Germany at the 2008 Summer Olympics. She is the German outdoor record holder in the event with a best of 2.06 m, although this is 1 cm less than the indoor record held by Heike Henkel.
She became German champion in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, and represents the club LG Eintracht Frankfurt.
Controversy arose in 2012 when she named an alleged stalker on Facebook, potentially violating German privacy laws.
Career.
Friedrich won the gold medal at the 2003 European Junior Championships, the bronze medal at the 2005 Summer Universiade, silver at the 2007 Summer Universiade and the gold medal at the 2009 Summer Universiade.
The 2008 indoor season saw significant improvement in Friedrich's clearances: she improved her best by 8 cm during the period, clearing two metres for the first time and setting her top mark at 2.02 m. Her coach noted that these achievements were due to her improved work ethic and focus. She finished eighth at the 2008 World Indoor Championships and took seventh in the high jump final at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 
Her 2009 indoor season started strongly with a win at the 2009 European Athletics Indoor Championships in a jump of 2.01 m. Her outdoor season started with a personal best jump of 2.06 metres in June 2009 at the Internationales Stadionfest, breaking Heike Henkel's outdoor national record of 2.05 m, and she won another gold at the 2009 European Team Championships later that month. She gained a complete set of Universiade medals in July when she finally won the gold at the 2009 Summer Universiade.
Ariane Friedrich won the bronze medal at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin. She reflected that the public pressure for her to become world champion had placed her under much stress. However, she was very happy at having achieved a jump of 2.02 m for third place behind Blanka Vlašić and Anna Chicherova. Friedrich missed the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships due to a knee injury and instead set her sights on medalling at the 2010 European Athletics Championships. She jumped 2.01 m at the European Championships in Barcelona, but she was beaten by Vlašić (who equalled the championship record) and also by Emma Green on count-back, leaving her with the bronze medal. She became the first German woman to win at the Internationales Hochsprung-Meeting Eberstadt a month later.
On December 22, 2010 she ruptured her left Achilles tendon during training and will be ruled out of the entire 2011 season including the World Championships in Daegu.

Prendergast was top scorer for the reserves in 1968–69 and he made his first team debut towards the end of that season, scoring in a 3–2 defeat at Newcastle United on 9 April 1969. The following season saw Wednesday relegated to Division Two with Prendergast making just 12 league appearances. The 1970–71 season saw Prendergast become a regular in the first team, finishing as top scorer by a comfortable margin with 16 goals.
The rest of his Sheffield Wednesday career saw Prendergast beset by injuries, in 1972–73 he only made 19 appearances after suffering cartilage trouble and internal bleeding in his knee. He returned the following season to forge a good striking partnership with Brian Joicey which realised 23 goals, with Prendergast contributing 11 and being voted Player of the Year. However, misfortune struck towards the end of that season when he suffered a broken leg in a goalless draw at Preston on 12 April 1974.
Prendergast returned to first team action in February 1975 to play five games in a struggling Wednesday side that suffered relegation to Division Three for the first time in their history. He scored the clubs first ever goal in Division Three in a 1–2 away defeat at Southend in August 1975 and went on to have a good season as he netted 13 goals in 39 appearances to be top scorer for the second time. In the 1976–77 campaign he was limited to five full appearances as injury and the good form of Rodger Wylde and Tommy Tynan kept him out of the team. In April 1977, after ten years service with the club, he was granted a testimonial match against Leicester City with 3,179 fans turning up to see Leicester win 3–2 with Ron Springett and Peter Swan coming out of retirement to play for Mick. Prendergast was placed on the transfer list in January 1978 as Jack Charlton, who had taken over as Wednesday manager, began a clear out of staff. In March 1978 just before the transfer window closed he signed for Barnsley for a fee of £14,000.
Barnsley.
Prendergast stayed at Barnsley for 14 months, but he only made 12 full league appearances in that time, making a single appearance in the 1978–79 season as Barnsley gained promotion from Division Four. He went on a months loan to Halifax Town in October/November 1978 making four league appearances and one in the FA Cup. He scored his last goal for a league club while with Halifax, netting in a 1–2 defeat at Grimsby Town on 18 November 1978.
Latter career and retirement.
With his professional career over at the age of 29, Prendergast had brief spells in non-league football at Mexborough Town Athletic and Denaby United. He was given a second testimonial match while at Denaby against Sheffield Wednesday before being advised to retire completely from playing on medical grounds in the early 1980s. He was forced to have a hip replacement at the age of 36.
Death.
Aged 59 years old, on 29 April 2010 Prendergast died at Mexborough Montagu Hospital.

Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae

The Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae is an ancient "regionary", i.e., a list of monuments, public buildings and civil officials in Constantinople during the mid-5th century (between 425 and the 440s), during the reign of the emperor Theodosius II. The text lists the fourteen regions in which Constantinople was divided, along with the major public buildings such as fora, theatres, churches, palaces, baths and pools. It also lists the number of "houses" ("domus"), although there is uncertainty over the exact meaning of the term. Finally, the list includes the civil officials of each region, including the curators, the heads of the associations ("collegia") and the heads of neighbourhoods ("vicomagistri").
The Latin text of the "Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae" was published by Otto Seeck, as an appendix to his edition of the "Notitia Dignitatum" (1876). The "Notitia Urbis" was probably written between 447 and 450 and goes back to official sources. Although the simple lists are not always easy to understand, the "Notitia Urbis" helps to know what the city must have looked like before Justinian's building program.

A Man Called Hero

A Man Called Hero is a 1999 Hong Kong wuxia film directed by Andrew Lau and based on the manhua series "" by Ma Wing-shing.
Plot.
The story begins in early Republican China. Hero Hua (Ekin Cheng) is given his family heirloom, the Red Sword, and is accepted by Pride (Anthony Wong), a martial arts master, as a student after passing a test. When he returns home, he is horrified to see that his family have been murdered by Westerners for opposing the opium trade. That night, Hero breaks up the Westerners' party and kills them in revenge. He spends the rest of the night with his lover, Jade (Kristy Yang). The next morning, he flees from China and sails to America.
16 years later, Hero's childhood friend, Sheng (Jerry Lamb), and Hero's son, Sword Hua (Nicholas Tse), arrive in New York City on the first day of the Chinese New Year. They visit China House, the biggest inn in Chinatown, where they see a lion dance performance led by the Boss of China House (Yuen Biao). A group of thugs show up, demanding that the Boss hand over a monk called Luohan (Ken Lo), whom they believe to be hiding in China House. The Boss defeats the thugs in a fight and drives them away. The Boss then shows Sword and Sheng to Luohan, who tells them how he met and befriended Hero on board the ship bound for America, and their experiences as labourers in Steel Bull Canyon. Sword and Sheng later visit Jade's grave, and Sheng tells Sword about how he and Jade travelled to New York City before Sword's birth in search of Hero, and how Sword's parents were reunited in America. While visiting the shop where Sword's parents took their wedding photographs, Sword and Sheng sense someone following them. Sword surprises the stalker and manages to corner her after a brief chase through the streets. She identifies herself as Kate (Grace Yip), the daughter of Shadow (Dion Lam), Hero's senior.
Kate leads Sword and Sheng to her father. Shadow tells them how he rescued Hero from Steel Bull Canyon when the latter was buried in the sand for allegedly murdering two men, and what happened after Hero and Jade were reunited. Hero and Shadow encountered the Five Elements Ninjas and defeated them in a fight. During the fight, Hero injured the female ninja, Wood (Shu Qi), but spared her life and sent her for medical treatment. Wood developed a crush on Hero, and that incurred the jealousy of the Gold Ninja (Mark Cheng), who is secretly in love with Wood. Jade had just given birth to a pair of twins in China House when the Gold Ninja set fire to the building. Taking advantage of the chaos, a traitor called Bigot (Elvis Tsui) kidnapped Sword's twin sister and there had been no news of her since then. Jade died in Hero's arms shortly after giving birth due to too much blood loss.
Shadow continues telling the story. After Jade's death, Hero met a fortune teller, who told him that he was born under the Star of Death and is destined to lead a life of loneliness as misfortune will befall those close to him. Hero entrusted his baby son, Sword, to Sheng before leaving with Shadow for Japan. In Japan, they witnessed a duel between their master, Pride, and Pride's junior and rival, Invincible (Francis Ng). Pride defeated Invincible but sustained internal injuries and died not long after the duel. Before his death, Pride passed Hero the martial arts manual "China Secret" and transferred all his powers to the latter.
Back in the present at China House, the Boss, along with Sword and the others, plan to liberate the labourers at Steel Bull Canyon. They disguise themselves as a Chinese opera troupe and infiltrate the canyon, catching the supervisors off guard in a surprise attack. Luohan sacrifices himself to stop the supervisors from throwing dynamite at the escaping labourers by launching a suicide attack on the enemy. Sword corners Bigot and demands the whereabouts of his twin sister, but Bigot suddenly draws out a gun and shoots Sword. Bigot is about to kill Sword when Hero shows up and finishes him off. Hero uses his inner energy to create an explosion and prevent a group of enemies on horseback from advancing further. The heroes and labourers then return to China House in triumph.
Sword is happy to see his father in person for the first time after hearing the stories about his father. However, Hero appears cold towards his son and constantly keeps a distance away from the latter, as he persistently believes the fortune teller's words that he will lose his loved ones if he gets close to them. Hero also meets Wood, who has maintained her crush on him for the past 16 years, but he refuses to accept her. She warns Hero that her master, Invincible, has arrived in New York City. Since Pride had died, Invincible turns on Hero, Pride's successor, to finish the duel. The next morning, Invincible shows up at China House and fights with the Boss and Sword until Hero appears and stops him. Hero and Invincible then duel on top of the Statue of Liberty and eventually Hero defeats and destroys Invincible. Before the film ends, Sword and Sheng are seen preparing to depart China House while Hero watches them from a distance and walks away in the opposite direction as they leave.
Music.
The music and songs for the film were composed by Chan Kwong-wing.

Fieller's theorem

In statistics, Fieller's theorem allows the calculation of a confidence interval for the ratio of two means.
Approximate confidence interval.
Variables "a" and "b" may be measured in different units, so there is no way to directly combine the standard errors as they may also be in different units. The most complete discussion of this is given by Fieller (1954).
Fieller showed that if "a" and "b" are (possibly correlated) means of two samples with expectations formula_1 and formula_2, and variances formula_3 and formula_4 and covariance formula_5, and if formula_6 are all known, then a (1 − "α") confidence interval ("m"L, "m"U) for formula_7 is given by
where
Here formula_10 is an unbiased estimator of formula_11 based on r degrees of freedom, and formula_12 is the formula_13-level deviate from the Student's t-distribution based on "r" degrees of freedom.
Three features of this formula are important in this context:
a) The expression inside the square root has to be positive, or else the resulting interval will be imaginary.
b) When "g" is very close to 1, the confidence interval is infinite.
c) When "g" is greater than 1, the overall divisor outside the square brackets is negative and the confidence interval is exclusive.
Approximate formulae.
These equations approximation to the full formula, and are obtained via a Taylor series expansion of a function of two variables and then taking the variance (i.e. a generalisation to two variables of the formula for the approximate standard error for a function of an estimate).
Case 1.
Assume that "a" and "b" are jointly normally distributed, and that "b" is not too near zero (i.e. more specifically, that the standard error of "b" is small compared to "b"),
From this a 95% confidence interval can be constructed in the usual way (degrees of freedom for "t" * is equal to the total number of values in the numerator and denominator minus 2).
This can be expressed in a more useful form for when (as is usually the case) logged data is used, using the following relation for a function of "x" and "y", say ƒ("x", "y"):
to obtain either,
or
Case 2.
Assume that "a" and "b" are jointly normally distributed, and that b is near zero (i.e. SE("b") is "not" small compared to "b").
First, calculate the intermediate quantity:
You cannot calculate the confidence interval of the quotient if formula_19, as the CI for the denominator "μ""b" will include zero.
However if formula_20 then we can obtain
Other.
One problem is that, when g is not small, CIs can blow up when using Fieller's theorem. Andy Grieve has provided a Bayesian solution where the CIs are still sensible, albeit wide. Bootstrapping provides another alternative that that does not require the assumption of normality.
History.
Edgar C. Fieller (1907–1960) first started working on this problem while in Karl Pearson's group at University College London, where he was employed for five years after graduating in Mathematics from King's College, Cambridge. He then worked for the Boots Pure Drug Company as a statistician and operational researcher before becoming deputy head of operational research at RAF Fighter Command during the Second World War, after which he was appointed the first head of the Statistics Section at the National Physical Laboratory.

Uttoxeter began the 1982/83, with the majority of the former JCB players now playing at Oldfields Sports and Social Club, in Uttoxeter, where they remain to this day.
Initially the Club ran three senior teams. They played their matched at either Oldfields Hall Middle School or on a field belonging to Fred Allen at the rear of the Shell Mex depot, on the Dovefields Industrial Estate, but were invited to use Oldfields Sports and Social Clubs facilities post match.
Eventually they acruired a pitch at Oldfields Sports and Social club despite objections from Soccer and Cricket players who were already operting teams at Oldfields.
Recently the club has acquired the use of a second pitch adjacent to the Uttoxeter Leisure Centre. The Club now has a vibrant Youth Section, from tag to under 18 level.
The Club has won the Owen Cup five times, most recently in the 2007/8 competition.

Maryland Route 84

Maryland Route 84 (MD 84) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs from MD 75 near New Windsor north to MD 832 near Frizzelburg. MD 84 provides access to Uniontown and forms part of the connection between New Windsor and Taneytown in western Carroll County. The state highway was constructed from New Windsor to Uniontown in the mid-1920s. The northernmost portion of the highway was constructed in the late 1930s as MD 630, which became a disjoint part of MD 84 in 1951. The gap in MD 84 north of Uniontown was filled in 1956.
Route description.
MD 84 begins at an intersection with MD 75 (Green Valley Road) just north of Little Pipe Creek north of the town of New Windsor. The state highway heads northwest as Clear Ridge Road. At Clear Ridge Road South, which is unsigned MD 800B, MD 84 turns north through farmland and crosses Roop Branch. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Clear Ridge before entering the village of Uniontown. Within the Uniontown Historic District, MD 84 turns east onto the unincorporated town's main street at Middleburg Road, which heads west toward Middleburg. The state highway turns north onto Trevanion Road while Uniontown Road continues straight east; Uniontown Road passes the Weaver-Fox House within Uniontown and the Robert and Phyllis Scott House and the Englar-Schweigart-Rinehart Farm and Rockland Farm closer to Westminster. North of Uniontown, MD 84 turns east onto Baust Church Road while Trevanion Road continues straight past the namesake historic home on its way to Taneytown. The state highway veers north, passes through several curves, and crosses Meadow Branch. MD 84 reaches its northern terminus at MD 832 (Old Taneytown Road) in the hamlet of Tyrone west of Frizzelburg.
History.
The first section of modern MD 84 to be constructed was between modern MD 75 and MD 800B; this section and MD 800B form a segment of MD 75's original alignment that was constructed as a concrete road between 1921 and 1923. The first sections of MD 84 proper, which was then named Uniontown Road, were built in 1924 and 1925; a short section of macadam road was constructed from old MD 75 to Roop Branch and concrete from there to Uniontown. Baust Church Road was improved to a modern highway around 1936 and designated MD 630 by 1939. MD 630 became a disjoint section of MD 84 in 1951. The gap in the state highway was filled in 1956 when the connecting section of Trevanion Road became part of MD 84. MD 84's southern terminus was moved to its present location when MD 75 was relocated between Union Bridge and New Windsor around 1963.

Sidney Herbert Ray

Sidney Herbert Ray (May 28, 1858 – January 1, 1939) was a comparative and descriptive linguist who specialized in Melanesian languages. In 1892, he read an important paper, "The languages of British New Guinea", to the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists. In that paper, he established the distinction between the Austronesian and Papuan languages of New Guinea. Although he never held an academic position, and was employed throughout his working life as a school teacher, S. H. Ray was an energetic fieldworker, and participated in a number of expeditions. 
His first fieldwork was carried out as part of A. C. Haddon's 1898 Torres Straits Expedition along with W. H. R. Rivers, C. G. Seligman and Anthony Wilkin. At the time Ray was a primary school teacher, who had already made a study of two Torres Straits languages on the basis of missionary publications and data supplied by Haddon.

Philharmonie de Paris

The Philharmonie de Paris, a symphonic concert hall of 2,400 seats whose construction had been postponed for about twenty years, should complete the Cité de la Musique in early 2014. It is located in the Parc de la Villette in Paris.
Mainly dedicated to symphonic concerts, the Philharmonie de Paris will also present other forms of music, such as jazz and world music.
The project was announced on 6 March 2006 by the Minister of Culture and Communication, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres; the Mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë; and the Director of the Cité de la musique and of the Salle Pleyel, Laurent Bayle, during a press conference on the reopening of the Salle Pleyel, now linked with the Cité.
As far as acoustics are concerned, the concert hall will envelope the audience around the stage, following the model pioneered by the Berlin Philharmonie, in order to intensify the feeling of intimacy between the performers and their audience.
The Philharmonie de Paris will accommodate administrative offices for several orchestras, an educational centre, exhibition spaces and a restaurant, as well technical and logistical infrastructure and a car park.
The cost of construction is expected to be 170 million euros, and will be shared by the national government (45 per cent), the Ville de Paris (45 per cent), and the Région Île-de-France (10 per cent).
In 2007, Jean Nouvel won the design competition for the auditorium. He brought in Brigitte Métra as his partner, along with Marshall Day Acoustics and Nagata Acoustics.

Agence Française de Lutte contre le Dopage

Agence Française de Lutte contre le Dopage (AFLD), often referred to in English as the "French Anti-Doping Agency", although this is not a direct translation of the name, is an independent public authority formed in 2006 and charged with ensuring that participants in sports in France do not violate rules regarding doping. 
AFLD has been particularly prominent in cases involving the Tour de France, such as that of Floyd Landis, who was stripped of his title in the 2006 race.
A breakdown in the relationship between AFLD and the International Cycling Union (UCI) in relation to testing procedures in the 2009 Tour de France lead to the severance of the role which gave AFLD their highest profile cases. In 2010, a threatened reduction in the grant from the French government, which had decided against increasing a tax on television rights for sports that was to fund it, placed the future of AFLD in doubt.

Battle of Bov

The Battle of Bov (German : Bau) was a battle between troops fighting for Schleswig-Holstein, and those for Denmark, which happened on April 9, 1848 in the area of Flensborg in Denmark, during the First Schleswig War. Denmark won the engagement. It was the first battle of the First Schleswig War.
Background.
In 1848, the First Schleswig War started, as Schleswig-Holstein was trying to separate from Denmark, and Denmark considered it a part of the country. The Kingdom of Prussia, the Austrian Empire and the German Confederation, sent troops to support Schleswig-Holstein in its attempt to secede from Denmark, and become a part of the German Confederation. Wishing to defeat Denmark before German, Austrian, and Prussian troops arrived, 7,000 Schleswig-Holsteinian soldiers under General Krohn occupied Flensborg on March 31, 1848.
Prelude.
Danish troops landed on the Holdnaes peninsula east of Flensborg and, worried that he would be surrounded, Gen. Krohn asked for permission to withdraw his soldiers from the settlement. His request was approved, and he planned to fall back during April 9. Danish commanders had decided their attack would start before Krohn withdrew. They decided that the left flank of the Danish army would launch a diversionary attack, whilst the right wing and cavalry would encircle the enemy, and their attacks would be supported by a naval squadron in Flensborg Fjord. The Schleswig-Holsteins were arranged according to the plan that they were going to withdraw, and were not prepared to put up a co-ordinated resistance.
Battle.
The Danish soldiers began their attack between 08:00 and 09:00 on April 9. Badly co-ordinated and without their superior commander, the Prince of Noer, who arrived two hours after the battle had started, the Schleswig-Holsteins were unable to win against the Danish forces.
Aftermath.
Thirty-five Schleswig-Holsteins died as a result of the battle, whilst Denmark lost the lives of 16; 138 Schleswig-Holsteins were wounded, and so were 66 Danes; and 923 Schleswig-Holsteins were captured to no Danish prisoners.

Maryland Route 88

Maryland Route 88 (MD 88) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Black Rock Road, the state highway runs from MD 30 Business in Hampstead east to MD 25 near Butler. MD 88 was constructed around the Carroll–Baltimore county line in the early 1910s. The remainder of the highway to MD 25 was completed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 88 was relocated in Hampstead in the mid-1960s; the old route became MD 833.
Route description.
MD 88 begins at an intersection with MD 30 Business (Main Street) in the town of Hampstead. The state highway heads east as two-lane Lower Beckleysville Road to a roundabout at the east town limit. Lower Beckleysville Road continues northeast as a county highway that becomes Mount Carmel Road in Baltimore County and leads to MD 137. The northwest leg of the roundabout is MD 833 (Old Black Rock Road), the old alignment of MD 88 that heads back toward the center of Hampstead. MD 88 continues southeast as Black Rock Road and enters Baltimore County. The state highway passes through farmland on top of a ridge until the highway curves east and descends into the valley of Indian Run. MD 88 crosses the stream just before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 25 (Falls Road) north of the village of Butler.
History.
MD 88 was paved as a state-aid road in three sections by 1915. The first two sections, from Main Street in Hampstead east to the Baltimore–Carroll county line and from the county line to Trenton Road, were paved in macadam with widths of and , respectively. The segment from Trenton Road to Mount Zion Road was built as a wide concrete road. The remainder of MD 88 from Mount Zion Road to Falls Road was built in two sections: from MD 25 west to Benson Mill Road in 1929 and from there to Mount Zion Road by 1933. The highway was relocated onto a western extension of Lower Beckleysville Road through Hampstead in 1966; MD 88's old route from Main Street to Lower Beckleysville Road became MD 833. The roundabout at the intersection of MD 88 and MD 833 was constructed in 2003.

Tomb of the Jibei King

The Tomb of the Jibei King () is a tomb from the time of the Western Han Dynasty in Changqing District of Jinan, Shandong Province, China. It is also known as the Han Dynasty Tomb of Shuangru Mountain (). The tomb is thought to have been the burial site of Liu Kuan (), the last king of Jibei () who ruled from 97–85BC during the time of the Emperor Wu of Han of the Western Han Dynasty. The tomb was a major archaeological find since it had been untouched by grave robbers. Its discovery was ranked among the top ten Chinese archaeological finds of 1996 by Chinese National Office for Cultural Artefacts.
The City of Lu (thought to have been located near modern Luchengwa in Jinan City about 5 kilometers north of the tomb) served as the capital of the Kingdom of Jibei as well as a cultural and economic center during the time of the Han Dynasty. Liu Kuan, the last king of Jibei was forced to commit suicide for having an affair with his widowed step mother and for cursing the emperor during a sacrifice. The tomb of the King of Jibei was carved into a limestone cliff and covered a total area of 1,500 square meters. It was excavated during the years 1995 and 1997 by archaeologists of Shandong University. More than 2000 artifacts - bronze objects, jade objects, lacquer wares, iron artifacts, ceramics, and gold objects were recovered from the site. Among the jade artifacts, a jade mask made of 18 pieces, jade swords, and jade headrests are particularly noteworthy. Gold artifacts include about 20 gold ingots (so-called "gold cakes", ) as well as pieces belonging to chariots. The discovered artifacts reflect the wealth of the city during this period. If the identification of the tomb as the burial place of Liu Kuan is correct, 
he had been granted a royal burial despite his disgrace. However, the jade burial suit which was customary for wealthy aristocrats of the period may have been denied to him as a result.
The artifacts have been relocated to the Museum of Changqing District () in the town of Changqing and the Shandong Provincial Museum () in Jinan.
The tomb has been listed as a monument of the People's Republic of China with resolution number 5-168. The archaeological name of the site is "Shuangrushan Han Tomb Number 1" as a second tomb from the same period is located nearby.

Ein as-Sultan

ʿEin as-Sulṭān alsoʿAin Sulṭān Camp () is a village and Palestinian refugee camp in the Jericho Governorate in the eastern West Bank situated in the Jordan Valley, located 1 kilometers north-west of Jericho near the spring ʿEin as-Sulṭān. ʿEin as-Sulṭān had a population of over 1,469 inhabitants in mid-year 2006. In 1997, refugees constituted 81% of the population.
History.
The first permanent settlement built near ancient Jericho was by the Ein as-Sultan spring between 8000 and 7000 BC by an unknown people, and consisted of a number of walls, a religious shrine, and a 23-foot (7.0 m) tower with an internal staircase. After a few centuries, it was abandoned for a second settlement established in 6800 BC close by.
The Crusaders improved the water mills at Ein as Sultan to crush sugar cane in "tawahin es-sukkar" (sugar mills) and exported the sugar to Jerusalem. The Crusaders are credited with introducing sugarcane production to the city.
ʿEin as-Sulṭān camp was established in 1948, on 870 dunums of arid land below the Mount of Temptation. Just before the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, the camp had accommodated some 20,000 refugees. During the hostilities the majority of the refugees fled across the Jordan River to Jordan.
In 1987 the authorities tried to expel as many of the refugees as they could. The US reports state that the refugees were suffering from "deteriorating economic circumstances".
Today, ʿEin Sulṭān has a small population of only 1,732 registered refugees. Some non-refugees have moved onto the camp's lands and built illegal homes as there is over-crowding and Israel authorities controls the issuing of building permits.
Water.
Water scarcity is a major problem in this arid area, especially during the summer. The springs Ein as-Sultan, Ayn al-Nuway'mia and Ayn al Duyuk were utilised during the Roman occupation for irrigation to cultivate the land. After 1975 the water from the spring Ein as-Sultan, was collected in 4 small basins. UNRWA supplies Ein Sultan with water by pumping it from a nearby spring. The out fall of spring is close to Tell el-Sultan, the site of ancient Jericho. During the summer months, water shortages in the camp cause tremendous hardship for the refugees. However, the Israeli water company Mekorot has become the main supplier of water to the camp after Israel took control of water sources.
Following the signing of the Cairo Agreement in 1994 and Israeli army redeployment, the camp came under the control of the Palestinian National Authority.
In 2002, two stories were added to Ein Sultan School, including a new library, multi-purpose room, additional three class rooms and computer lab.

Bremer River (South Australia)

The Bremer River is a river in South Australia that rises on the eastern side of the Mount Lofty Ranges at an altitude of 431 metres and drains into Lake Alexandrina at the lower end of the Murray-Darling Basin. Major tributaries of the Bremer River are Mount Barker Creek (draining the town of Mount Barker) and Dawesley Creek (rising near Brukunga)
Nomenclature.
One recorded Aboriginal name for the Bremer River was Miochi. On 31 December 1837 the original European discoverer, Robert Cock, named it the Hindmarsh River, in deference to the first Governor, John Hindmarsh. This led to the following proclamation by the second Governor, George Gawler, appearing in the "South Australian Gazette", effective 26 June 1839, ‘His Excellency the Governor having observed that to the southward Adelaide there are two rivers named ‘The Hindmarsh’ – one flowing into Encounter Bay, and the other into Lake Alexandrina – is pleased to direct that the latter river shall in future be named the ‘River Bremer’, in the public maps, in order to avoid confusion in the geographical description of the province.’ The man so honoured by the re-naming was the distinguished British Royal Navy officer James Bremer, who happened to command HMS "Alligator", which conveyed Hindmarsh back to England. 
Geography.
The largest town in the catchment area is Mount Barker. Other towns include Nairne and Kanmantoo. Towns on the Bremer River itself include Harrogate, Callington and Langhorne Creek, where the floodwaters are used to irrigate the local vineyards.

List of Extras characters

The British television sitcom "Extras" centres around the main characters of Andy Millman, Maggie Jacobs and Darren Lamb, in addition to several more recurring characters.
Main characters.
Andy Millman.
Portrayed by Ricky Gervais, Andrew "Andy" Millman is the lead character of "Extras". Andy's dream to become an actor – he left his steady day job at Natwest in Wokingham in order to pursue it - is endlessly frustrated by the fact that his agent Darren Lamb is incompetent, circumstances seem to conspire against him, and the only work he can get is as a film extra. His best friend is fellow extra Maggie Jacobs, but her fervent desire to help, coupled with a lack of tact and subtlety, means that she more often than not causes him just as much trouble.
At the end of Series 1, Millman successfully managed to sell a sitcom called "When the Whistle Blows", which proves to be a commercial but not a critical success.
In contrast to Gervais' other famed role as David Brent, who, through his desire to be liked by those around him comes off as pathetic, Millman often makes little or no attempt to be liked - often being downright rude - but frequently comes across as being a much more likeable character than Brent. This may be due to his increased sense of self-awareness and intelligence; when compared to Brent, Millman is all too aware of when he has stepped over the line and become genuinely offensive (although this doesn't stop him from causing genuine offence). Also unlike Brent, who was largely in denial about the world around him, Millman is a more bitter and cynical character with a more realistic appraisal of the world and how it works. Whereas Brent was based on a former boss of Gervais, Millman's personality is more autobiographical in origin.
A running joke is that Millman did not lose his virginity until the age of 28 (although the first time this is mentioned, Maggie says he was 22), and to a woman who looked like Ronnie Corbett (who turns up in a later episode as himself). Andy's nemesis throughout the programme is Greg Lindley-Jones, who also started out as an extra before finding success in a number of productions and becoming a well-respected actor, much to Andy's annoyance.
Maggie Jacobs.
Portrayed by Ashley Jensen, Maggie Jacobs is characterised as a genuinely kind and supportive individual who only wants to help out. Unfortunately for her and those around her, she is also portrayed as being rather socially inept and lacking in any sort of internal censor or sense of tact, which means that she's more likely to say precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong person, and thus create more trouble for herself and those around her (especially Andy, whom she frequently embarrasses by inadvertently puncturing his pretensions towards being an actor). Although the character possesses no malicious intent, she also appears to be rather naive and poorly educated when it comes to matters of race and political correctness - which, when coupled with her general tactlessness, frequently results in her causing genuine offence through inadvertent insults and stereotypes. In series two her earthy ways are shown to contrast greatly with the pretensions of Andy's new friends. Gervais has stated that he thinks the personality of Maggie resembles a female version of Karl Pilkington, whose friendship with Gervais was developing during the time Extras was being written. During the series Andy even explains that he and Maggie are friends because she's so stupid and it amuses him, which is precisely what Gervais has said about Pilkington.
Maggie is rather man-hungry, and throughout the series she is constantly on the lookout for 'Mr. Right.' However, owing to circumstance and her aforementioned tendency to commit social "faux-pas," the relationships she starts with men throughout the series rarely last long. However, there have been instances in which the men she is interested in turn out to be very much less than desirable, through no fault of her own. In one episode she was constantly pestered and eventually kissed by Orlando Bloom, even though she had told him that she did not find him particularly attractive.
Darren Lamb.
Portrayed by Stephen Merchant, Darren Lamb is Andy Millman's agent. He is utterly incapable of breaking an act, and his usual negotiating tactic is to simply agree with whatever anyone else says, or suggest someone other than his client for the part. He's very good at deducting his 12.5% commission ("15% for adverts") despite frequently having done nothing to contribute to his act's success. For example, in series two episode two, whilst in the pub, he asks for £27.50 from Barry for the £220 he was paid for fixing someone's gutter, despite having no involvement in getting him the job. He can often be seen begging for this type of payment. His lack of professional skills is typified by the occasion he inadvertently left his office phone unplugged for two days without noticing. He is also known to make inappropriate remarks at the least helpful of times. Lamb works part-time at the Carphone Warehouse, but in Episode 4 of Series 2, he mentions he only works on Saturdays while "Narinder" is pregnant.
Despite these (and more) overwhelming examples of incompetence, Lamb is nevertheless the agent of the series' protagonist, the long-suffering Andy Millman, who is more than aware of his agent's utter uselessness but nevertheless feels compelled to retain him out of a slightly perverse mixture of loyalty and pity. Lamb is also the agent of "Barry from "EastEnders"".
In episode six of the second series, an increasingly frustrated Millman threatens to sack Lamb after he is caught masturbating in his office. However, Lamb manages to arrange a meeting between Millman and his hero Robert De Niro, with the indication given that he managed to keep his job as a result.
Lamb does not have a regular girlfriend and his rather crude way of chatting up women (as seen in episode two of series two) means few have any wish to fulfil his sexual desires. In the fourth episode he actually managed to invite Maggie to his house, things go well until everything blows when Lamb tries to break an unflushable turd in his toilet into pieces with a whisk, causing Maggie to leave his house in shock.
Barry of "EastEnders".
Shaun Williamson plays himself as one of Darren's clients. He used to play Barry Evans on the British soap opera "EastEnders", but left to pursue a multi-million pound contract elsewhere and failed. Darren Lamb doesn't use his real name, but instead calls him "Barry of "EastEnders"" or just "Barry" and occasionally "Barr". This also extends to other characters as seen in episode 1.2, where fellow "EastEnders" actor Ross Kemp only seems to know Shaun Williamson after being told his "EastEnders" character name. He carries an air of accepted defeat, and helps Lamb around his office, appearing to be marginally the more competent of the two. They later team up with another ex-Eastender, Dean Gaffney, at the Carphone Warehouse. Andy and Dean are the only ones who ever call him "Shaun".
Greg Lindley-Jones.
Portrayed by Shaun Pye, Greg Lindley-Jones is a snide and self-absorbed Royal Academy of Dramatic Art graduate and Andy's nemesis. Like Andy, he started out as an extra, struggling to get more significant roles. However, unlike Andy, he has managed to secure lines in various productions such as "The Bill" and consequently he possesses a rather high opinion of himself and is constantly belittling Andy. Andy rarely gets ahead in his encounters with Greg. In the first episode of series one it is revealed he is subsidised by his wealthy parents. While both Andy and Greg are suitably advantaged so that they can afford to work full time in minor acting roles, Greg's in through a privileged background and Andy's through a previous career at the bank. Greg is notably annoyed when Andy tries to celebrate his BBC series triumph with fellow extras in Season 1 Episode 6.
Greg gradually gains more recognition as a successful stage, television and eventually film actor. In the Christmas special he boasts to Andy how the fictitious film "Byron: a life", (in which he starred alongside Clive Owen) is number one in the UK film charts and number two in America. Andy becomes envious of the fact Greg is now a well-respected Hollywood actor whilst he is only recognised for featuring in a lowbrow sitcom.
"When the Whistle Blows".
Ray is the manager, played by Andy Millman, in turn played by Ricky Gervais. His catchphrase is an incredulous "Are you having a laugh!? Is he/she having a laugh?". The character was based on a man Millman worked for before deciding to pursue acting full-time, and originally his catchphrase was merely something Millman wrote in because it was something that man used to say. Millman's co-writer decided to develop it into a catchphrase. To play the part of Ray, Millman is forced into wearing oversized glasses and a curly black wig to add the "hilarity", despite the fact that the real Ray Stokes did not look like this. Many of Ray's mannerisms, such as raising and lowering his glasses, suggest that he could be a parody of Reg Holdsworth, an old character from the long-running British soap "Coronation Street".
Rita is played by Liza Tarbuck, who also sings the "When The Whistle Blows" theme song. She is a single parent and is the central, straight character of the show. She is married in the Christmas Special.
Gobbler is a large, unintelligent character, played by Andrew Buckley. His inability to understand his co-workers' jokes often prompts his catchphrase, "I don't get it!" It is suggested that he has appalling personal hygiene. He becomes intelligent after being hit in the head by a donkey in the Christmas Special.
Brains, played by Jamie Chapman, is the stereotypical smart one of the group, sporting glasses, a quiffed hairstyle and a pedantic tone. His rather detailed knowledge of all subjects does not impress Ray, who will inevitably come out with the "are ya 'avin' a laugh?" line. He 'comes out' in the Christmas Special.
Kimberley, played by Sarah Moyle is the only other female character on the show. She seems to lead a rather homely lifestyle. In the Christmas Special, she received a promotion.
Keith is played by TV presenter Keith Chegwin in the pilot episode. His character was originally called "Alfie", but a frustrated Millman changed it because Keith Chegwin was confused at being addressed with a different name. We are told he is always late for work, but in this instance turns up late because he was at his sister's funeral. This also confused Chegwin, who confided: "the thing is, my sister's not dead".
There are relatively few other characters in the sitcom, but they include Chris Martin (playing himself), and a Japanese couple, who also spawn another catchphrase "Velly velly solly" (as seen on a T-shirt worn by a crowd member in the Christmas Special). Ray's wife is mentioned, but never appears - which is an old cliché of British comedy, e.g., "Minder" and Dad's Army. Andy appears in a dual role as Ray's twin sister.

<doc id="18459211" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18459211" title="S.S. Lazio fans">
S.S. Lazio fans

This article is about the fans of Italian football club S.S. Lazio.
History.
The beginning.
The history of organized fan groups of S.S. Lazio, known in Italian as the "Tifoseria Laziale". It began in the late 1960s when small groups of supporters filled the steps of Stadio Olimpico in Rome. They belonged to different groups which were "Tuparamos, Eagles, Ultras, Vigilantes, NAB, CAST" and "Marines", the latter consisting mostly of younger fans.
The foundation of Eagles Supporters.
The early groups were not united and so in 1971, the first major ultras group was formed: Commandos Monteverde Lazio, also known as "C.M.L. '74". In 1976, the "G.A.B.A. (Gruppi Associati Bianco Azzurri)" was formed. They renamed themselves the Eagles Supporters the following year. The name was of British influence and for over a decade, the Eagles Supporters led the Lazio terrace, Curva Nord.
From 1978 to 1987.
In 1978, a group called "VIKING Lazio" was formed, and took their place in the Curva Sud. In this same year, the Eagles Supporters, who originally began in the south stands, made their way to Curva Nord, which became the main Lazio terrace. Other small groups followed the Eagles besides Viking.
During the 1980s, the Curva Nord was admired and imitated by the rest of Italy because of their passion and originality which set them apart from the rest. During this time, Lazio's fans created what is known in Italy as a "gemellaggio", or twinning, with fans of Bari, Torino and especially Triestina.
Despite this decade being one of Lazio's worst in history, avoiding a Third division relegation on a play-out match, the Curva became a major expression of passion, with several travelling groups filling opposition grounds around the country. The club maintained a significant number of supporters despite the fact that Lazio was playing in Serie B at the time. Approximately 20,000 fans followed the team to Pisa and Arezzo, 4,000 travelled to Udine, 80,000 attended a home match against Catania. Up to 35,000 travelled south to Napoli for Lazio's clash with Campobasso and Taranto, two matches which became etched in the club's history and meant that the club avoided relegation to Serie C.
The arrival of the Irriducibili.
During a Lazio-Padova match in 1987, a 10 meter long banner announced the arrival of a new Ultra group on the scene, "Irriducibili Lazio" formed by Antonio Grinta. "Irriducibili" rose to power in the Curva Nord and revolutionized the way Lazio fans supported their side. No more drums were used but English chanting styles were adopted. This contrasted boldly with the Italian style of the "Eagles Supporters", and by 1992, Irriducibili were by far Lazio's most powerful group as the "Eagles Supporters" disbanded.
With the arrival of the new club president, Sergio Cragnotti, Lazio qualified for European competition becoming one of the world's strongest teams. During this period, Lazio ultras formed close ties with both Interisti and Veronesi. In addition to these, relationships with supporters of Real Madrid, Chelsea and Paris Saint Germain developed.
The number of traveling Lazio fans did not drop from the "old days" though, as approximately 4,000 travelled to Dortmund and Vienna, 20,000 to Paris, 15,000 to Birmingham for the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final and 10,000 to Monaco for the UEFA Supercup despite only being allocated 3,500 tickets.
The new millennium.
The Serie A 2002-03 season was an important year for the "Irriducibili" as they achieved their fifteenth anniversary and in that same year, Lazio opted to retire the jersey number 12, permanently dedicated to Curva Nord.
Currently, the Curva Nord is led by the "Banda Noantri"; a group which existed from 2000 until 2005 but then disappeared due to some of the members getting banned from the stadium or sentenced to prison. They took over the Curva Nord from the Irriducibili during the season 2009/10, when the leaders of Irriducibili decided to invite politician Polverini on to the Curva Nord, which was not accepted by the vast majority of the ultras on the Curva Nord and on Tribuna Tevere. The Irriducibili now exist on the background and don't display any banners anymore. The current leaders are members from the group "Banda Noantri" and from "In Basso a Destra". Apart from those there are the "CML '74". Groups such as Viking and Veterani disappeared since many years now. The "Legione Mr.Enrich" are based in the old Curva Sud-Maestrelli together with "Ardite Schiere". In 2006, "Sodalizio" was born, allowing fans all over Italy to follow Lazio more actively, home and away matches either.
"Gemellaggi".
Lazio ultras' strongest friendship is certainly with the ultras of Inter. This friendship was born around the mid-1980s and has grown stronger in recent years with the 1997–98 UEFA Cup final in Paris and the infamous 2001–02 Serie A season decider on 5 May 2002 at the Stadio Olimpico, when many fans of Lazio supported Inter, their opposition, hoping they would claim the Scudetto instead of hated rival Juventus. The match ended 4–2 to Lazio, a result which saw Inter lose their title on the last day and many Lazio ultras called for manager Alberto Zaccheroni to be sacked.
Another twinning of Lazio was born during the 80s, with Triestina. It was formed when the two sides were both playing in Serie B. On a match against Lazio, the Triestina ultras unfurled a banner, stating in Italian: "Welcome Eagles, together we return". The twinning only got stronger recently when, during a Coppa Italia match at the Stadio Olimpico, between Triestina and Lazio's hated rivals AS Roma, the Triestina fans displayed Lazio banners in their terrace.
A friendship is held between the Lazio ultras and those of Hellas Verona. This is based on the two groups both being on the right-wing politically, and sharing the same ultras principles. However, Verona fans are twinned with those of Fiorentina, historically a rival of Lazio, which means there is only an "amicizia", or friendship, instead of a true twinning. Another similar friendship is shared with the ultras of Chieti.
Since they first played in Europe, Lazio began to develop friendships at an international level. The most important are those with the Real Madrid ultras known as "Ultras Sur", Espanyol Brigadas, Levski Sofia, and West Ham.
The first, with Real Madrid, was born in 2001 during a UEFA Champions League match between the two teams, while that with West Ham grew from the two teams mutual love for Paolo Di Canio, who started his career at Lazio before moving to West Ham in the late 1990s.
Rivalries.
Lazio's most notable rivalry is with Lazio neighbours A.S. Roma, with matches between the two teams referred to as Derby della Capitale. Other rivals in Italy include Napoli. 
During the 1970s, Lazio developed a strong hate for Pescara Calcio, who in return consider Lazio their greatest rival. In the 2012-13 season Lazio played at Pescara and won with 0-3. However the two sets of fans did clash at a Primavera match in neutral Ancona.
The ultras consider both Livorno and Atalanta to be among their greatest enemies. Both of these rivalries were born due to political ideologies, with both Livorno and Atalanta having predominately left-wing fans, while Lazio's hardcore is far-right. Lazio icon Paolo Di Canio and Livorno icon Cristiano Lucarelli have both performed controversial ideological salutes to fans during some of their matches.
Lazio also count Fiorentina, Juventus and Milan as rivals.

Wolfenstein (2009 video game)

Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter video game co-developed by Raven Software, id Software, and Endrant Studios and published by Activision. It is the sequel to "Return to Castle Wolfenstein", and uses the id Tech 4 engine. The game was released in 2009: in North America on August 18, Australia on August 19, and Europe on August 21.
Synopsis.
Setting.
The story is set in the fictional town of Isenstadt, which the Nazis have taken complete control of in order to mine rare Nachtsonne crystals necessary to access the "Black Sun" dimension. As the game progresses, happenings in Isenstadt become stranger (Military patrols are replaced by supernatural creatures, etc.) Locations include the town's sewers, a tavern, a hospital, a farm, an underground mining facility, a church, the SS headquarters, a dig site and caverns, a cannery, a radio station, a paranormal base, a general's home, a castle, an airfield and a large Zeppelin.
Plot.
In an introduction sequence, special agent B.J. Blazkowitz steals a medallion from a general on a German battleship. Discovered and captured, he unleashes the power of the medallion, which kills all his foes for him. Hijacking a plane, he escapes and returns to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting there, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne, mined only in Isenstadt, to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, a resistance group dedicated to freeing Isenstadt from the Nazis, and with them, makes it to Isenstadt.
In Isenstadt, he meets the brothers Stephan and Anton Kriege, who run the Black Market where Blazkowicz can upgrade all of his weapons and powers. (He pays for upgrades with gold earned from missions or found scattered throughout the game.) He also meets the leader of the Kreisau Circle, a former schoolteacher named Caroline Becker. Becker sends Blazkowicz on a mission into a dig site, where he frees a young Russian named Sergei Kovlov. He also finds an exact copy of the medallion that he found on the Nazi warship, which Kovlov calls the Thule Medallion. Kovlov introduces Blazkowicz to the Golden Dawn, a group of scholars who specialize in the occult, led by Dr. Leonid Alexandrov. The youth also shows Blazkowicz how to use the Thule Medallion. With a crystal provided by Kovlov, Blazkowicz is able to enter the Veil, a barrier between the real world and a dimension known as the Black Sun. Using the Veil, he manages to escape. As Blazkowicz completes more missions, he gains new weapons and new defensive and offensive powers for the Thule Medallion. Eventually, he manages to kill General Zetta, who turns out to be a monster when viewed through the Veil. The Black Market, the Kreisau Circle, and the Golden Dawn then move to a new location in downtown Isenstadt to escape retaliation for Zetta's death. 
Shortly after the move, Caroline Becker is captured and held in a nearby castle. Blazkowicz helps the Kreisau Circle stage a rescue mission. He confronts Zetta's replacement, Wilhelm “Deathshead” Strausse, who is eager for revenge after the events of Return to Castle Wolfenstein. During a struggle, Caroline is killed by Hans Grosse, Deathshead's henchman. Upon Blazkowicz's return to Isenstadt, Stephan Kriege informs him that he has killed his brother for being a mole and betraying both Blazkowicz and Caroline. Blazkowicz then finds out that a Nazi superweapon, powered by Black Sun energy, is about to be fired at the city from a zeppelin. He boards the airship, where he discovers that Dr. Alexandrov is also a traitor. Alexandrov's treachery is rewarded only by an execution at the hand of Hans Grosse. In order to prepare the weapon, Deathshead and Grosse enter the Black Sun through a portal that Nazi scientists had excavated and reassembled. Blazkowicz jumps in after them. In the Black Sun, he encounters Hans Grosse guarding the machine that powers Deathshead's superweapon. Grosse greets him in a mechanical suit outfitted with two chainguns (recreating his earlier appearance in Wolfenstein 3D), and a Thule Medallion identical to Blazkowicz's. Blazkowicz kills Grosse by jamming the Nachtsonne crystals from his medallion into Grosse's. He then destroys the machine, but Deathshead flees through the portal before B.J. can capture him. The explosion takes out both the portal and the zeppelin on the other side, effectively destroying all ways of accessing the Black Sun . In a post-credits cutscene, Deathshead is seen clambering out of the zeppelin wreckage, screaming in frustration.
Development.
Wolfenstein uses an improved version of id Software's id Tech 4 video game engine, the technology behind "Doom 3" and "". The game was developed by Raven Software for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The modifications to the game engine include depth of field effects, soft shadowing, post-processing effects, Havok physics, as well as the addition of a supernatural realm, called the Veil. While in the Veil the player has access to certain special abilities, such as the power to slow down time, to get around obstacles that exist in the real world, or even to be able to defeat enemies that have an otherwise impenetrable shield (similar to "Spirit Walk" from the previous id Tech 4 title "Prey") The multiplayer part of Wolfenstein was developed by Endrant Studios. Wolfenstein is the only recent id Software game not planned to have a Linux port, with the person in charge of Linux ports at id Timothee Besset commenting that "It is unlikely the new Wolfenstein title is going to get a native Linux release. None of it was done in house, and I had no involvement in the project."
On the day of "Wolfenstein"s release, the first PC patch was released to address several issues with the online multiplayer component. The multiplayer development studio, Endrant Studios, soon laid off some of its workforce after the completion of the development of Wolfenstein's multiplayer.
Motion comics.
Four promotional motion comics, each about 3 minutes long, were released. Each was based on a particular installment in the Wolfenstein series and served as a nostalgic reminder. The first one recreated "Wolfenstein 3D"s escape from Castle Wolfenstein, the Hans Grosse killing and the final battle against Adolf Hitler. The second was based upon Wolfenstein 3D's prequel game Spear of Destiny, and recreated its final battle, in which B.J. fights the cybernetic Death Knight and the Angel of Death for control of the Spear. The third comic was based on Return to Castle Wolfenstein and recreated the battle with Olaric, the destruction of an experimental plane and later the final battle against Heinrich I. The fourth comic was based on the Wolfenstein's own cinematic introduction and shows B.J. infiltrating a Nazi battleship to steal the first Thule medallion.
Reception.
As a result of low sales figures, Activision laid off employees from Raven Software.
Sequel.
The upcoming next chapter in the series called "" will be developed by MachineGames and id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks, and is set for launch on May 20, 2014 in the US on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows platforms. The ninth installment takes place during the 1960s in an alternate history world where the Nazis won World War II. Players will assume the role once again as series protagonist William "B.J." Blazkowicz.

Diljale

Diljale (one who has suffered a burnt heart) is an Indian Hindi action romance film released in the year 1996. It stars Ajay Devgan, Sonali Bendre and Madhoo as the lead protagonists. Amrish Puri, Shakti Kapoor and Parmeet Sethi played supporting roles in the film. The film was directed by Harry Baweja. It was a major hit and established Sonali Bendre's acting credentials.
Plot.
The story is based in Kashmir. It starts with a sad Radhika (Sonali Bendre) being introduced to an Army Major (Parmeet Sethi) by her father, Raja Saab (Shakti Kapoor) an erstwhile king and current politician. Raja Saab tells her that the Major will be a good husband for her. On the day of the engagement, news breaks of a terrorist attack in a nearby village led by the terrorist, Shaka (Ajay Devgan). The Major and Raja Saab leave with a large force to that village. But that turns out to be a ruse as Shaka comes to the place of the engagement and burns the marriage Mandap. Then he gives a long look to Radhika, who looks at him with hatred, and leaves. Shaka reaches his lair where he meets his leader, Dara (Amrish Puri) and Shabnam (Madhoo) and the rest of his gang. Dara welcomes him and proclaims him to be Diljale. Shabnam, who loves him, tries to hug him but Shaka rebuffs it.
Shaka then goes to visit his mother (Farida Jalal) where the story of Shaka is shown in a flashback. Shaka was originally Shyam, a patriotic college student and son of a local village leader. Radhika studies in the same college and they both fall deeply in love. When Raja Saab tries to usurp all the village land, Shyam's father organizes all the villages against him. Raja Saab bribes a local police officer (Gulshan Grover) who proclaims Shyam's father as a terrorist and kills him in an encounter. When Shyam goes to Raja Saab's home to take revenge, Raja Saab (who knows of their love affair and feels it is below his family's dignity) frames Shyam also as a terrorist and tries to kill him. Shyam escapes but Radhika, who only sees him threatening her father, berates him and proclaims him a terrorist. Brokenhearted Shyam joins Dara's group and becomes Shaka.
Back in the present time, the Major surrounds Shaka at his mother's home but finds himself outnumbered by Shaka's men. Shaka asks him to go away. The Major then confronts Radhika and asks her if she knows Shaka from earlier. Under pressure from Raja Saab, she denies knowing Shaka. 
The army captures four associates of Dara. In order to get them freed, Dara asks Shaka, Shabnam and some others to hijack a bus traveling from Vaishno Devi. When Shaka captures them and brings them to a ruined temple, he is shocked to find Radhika (who had gone to Vaishno Devi to pray for Shaka) among the hostages. She confronts him and tells him that he never loved her or the homeland, India. Shaka is stung and tells he that he lost everything for her love. She then tells him to release everyone since they are innocent and says that if he loves her, he will do so. He agrees under the condition that she will remain with him. When Shabnam and the others tried to stop this release, Shaka disarms them and releases the hostages and runs away with Radhika.
Dara is livid with the betrayal and wants to kill Shaka. Raja Saab meets him and tells him to kill Shaka and release Radhika. Dara agrees but in return wants his four associates released and for his entire group to be safely escorted by Raja Saab to Pakistan.
Meanwhile the corrupt police officer, who killed Shyam's father, tries to kill Shaka who disarms him. In order to save himself, the police officer tells the truth to Radhika who is shocked to see the depth of love which Shaka has for her. Shaka kills the police officer but is captured by Dara's men. Dara puts both of them under lock and key but Shabnam releases Shaka. Shaka confronts Dara and asks him not to sell his homeland to politicians like Raja Saab but Dara orders his men to kill Shaka. The Major and his army attack at that very moment. Raja Saab, Dara and his men escape with Radhika in their custody with Shaka and Shabnam in close pursuit. The Major finds Raja Saab's son hiding in a corner and finds out the truth about Shyam and Raja Saab.
Dara speaks to his Pakistani Intelligence controller that they need help crossing the border now. Since some Americans are visiting the border and Pakistan doesn't want to be caught supporting terrorists, the Pakistanis decide to mine the border crossing and kill Dara and his men.
Dara, Raja Saab and others reach the last border outpost. Raja Saab goes to talk to the captain of the post in order to facilitate the escape of Dara and his men. But Shaka has already reached there and is waiting for him in the captain's office. He kills Raja Saab but Dara and his men escape. When a couple of Dara's men try to kill Radhika, Shabnam kills them and rescues her. Shabnam brings Radhika to Shaka but they are all confronted by the Major. He tells Shaka that he knows the truth and is sorry but will still have to arrest him. Shaka agrees but wants to stop Dara and is men from crossing the border since he believes that they still have good in their heart. The Major agrees and they go in a snowmobile towards the border and reach there before Dara and his men. They see Pakistani soldiers laying mines but are captured by them. 
The Pakistani Major tells them they want to kill Dara and his men since they can always create more terrorists. Shaka and the Major kill them all and go towards the border. When Shaka goes to stop Dara and his men, the Major stops him saying that he wants to kill terrorists. Shaka says that he wants to kill terrorism. He shouts at Dara to stop but Dara thinks it is a trick. So Shaka jumps at one of the mines and is blasted. Shocked, Dara asks his men to stop.
Shaka wakes up in a hospital to find his mother, Radhika and the Major next to him. The Major takes him outside where Dara, Shabnam and everyone is waiting. Dara hugs him and apologizes and admits that love can defeat anything even terrorism. He says that they have all surrendered. Shabnam too bids him goodbye. Shyam and Radhika hug each other in the backdrop of the Tiranga.
Music.
Music of the film created waves among the youths. The film has 6 songs. They are listed below. The music composer is Anu Malik.
Reception.
It was highly praised and was blockbuster of 1996. The song "Ho nahi sakta" became very popular upon the movie release. This movie added yet another hit to Ajay Devgan's career. Ajay Devgan and Sonali Bendre were much praised for their acting in the movie.

Filipinos in the French military

In 1858, when the Philippines was a Spanish colony, France and Spain invaded Vietnam. A number of French troops involved in this campaign became casualties as a result of contracting illnesses such as cholera, dysentery, tropical diseases, and rickets. In order to deal with the manpower shortage which resulted from this situation, the French consul in Manila, the colonial capital of the Philippines, was given permission by the Spanish government to recruit nine hundred Indians, as Filipinos were then known, for the French navy and a sufficient number of men to form an infantry company and a cavalry squadron. It is said that one-third of the entire French force in this campaign consisted of mercenaries from the Philippines, who distinguished themselves in action and were well adapted to the environment.
There were twenty-three Filipino mercenaries who served in the French Foreign Legion from 1914 through 1918. The legionaries from the Philippines, by that time an American colony, constituted the largest number of legionaries from the region which years later would be known as Southeast Asia. Other legionaries from the region who served in the Legion during World War I were: four Cambodians; two Dutch Hindus; ten Indo-Chinese; two Siamese; and four Tonkinese. Interestingly, these Filipinos in French service outnumbered the Filipinos who served the colonial master in the American Expeditionary Force.
A number of Filipinos presently serve in the French foreign legion.

Litaneutria minor

Litaneutria minor, or the "agile ground mantis", is native to the drier regions of the United States. States known to have "L. minor" are: Colorado, Arizona to Mexico, and the eastern regions of Washington to California. They also can be found in Canada in the southern Okanagan Valley and are Canada's only native mantis. They are very active hunters and will be seen running across the ground from early spring to late summer.
Description.
Males and females obtain a length of about in the wild. The adults are usually dark grey or dark tan in color. Outer ventral margin of fore femur has 4 spines, fore femur lacks groove typical to other mantids, long thin filamentous antennae.
Males have 8 abdominal segments with a brown spot near the base of the forewings. Females have 6 abdominal segments with a rough pronotum and have no wings, usually showing wing pads however. Males appear to have much more developed wings than females, yet, do not fly.
Ecology.
"L. minor" can be observed actively hunting on open ground during sunny days. Ground mantids have only been observed hunting either on the ground or on small shrubs a few centimeters above the ground surface.
As with all mantids, the front legs of "L. minor" are highly developed to grab and hold prey. The four spines on the fore femur and the spines on the tibia are developed to rapidly close on prey, holding the prey in a tight grip, while the mandibles begin eating the prey.
Nymphs can sometimes be cannibalistic as with most mantids, and begin hunting their first day. Young feed mainly on small flies, but as they grow, they will hunt down and attack anything that they can.
Typical food sources include: moths, flies, grasshoppers, katydids and crickets. Ground mantids have been observed chasing down prey, rather than adopting the normal praying mantis “sit and wait” hunting behavior.
Life cycle.
"L. minor" is a solitary species and like most other praying mantises will only come together to mate. Mating times for this species are highly dependant upon weather conditions and prey availability. Typically females are most likely to accept a mate and have a successful clutch two weeks after their last molt.
Male ground mantids will detect a female by following a pheromone released by a sexually mature female. Once a male has located a female, he slowly approaches her, being sure to distinguish himself as a mate and not a prey item, and mounts the female. "L. minor" is an extremely aggressive species and the female may sometimes mistake the potential mate for prey, and attack and eat the male. Once successfully on the back of the female, the male "L. minor" will bend his abdomen down, attaching his spermataphore into the female's spermatheca. Canabalism during mating can be observed in many different species of mantids (usually 6-30% of the time) and "Litaneutria minor" is no exception, with nearly all females eating the male's head during mating. This unusually high percentage of cannibalism during mating is not common in most mantid species.
Two weeks after mating, the females lay egg cases known as ootheca on twigs and branches. The ootheca is long, with each ootheca containing 10–20 eggs. The eggs lay dormant over winter, and if they survive, nymphs will start emerging from the ootheca in early spring. Females will molt approximately 7 times, with their terminal molts being in mid to late summer. Males will molt only 6 times and will have a terminal molt mid to late summer also. Nymphs and juveniles spend all spring and early summer catching as much prey as possible and growing.
Adults reach sexual maturity in late summer and will mate as soon as they are sexually mature. Females begin laying eggs in late summer and early fall, and will continue to do so until both they and the males die out during the fall months. Only the fertile eggs last the winter, with the next generation emerging the following spring.
Defence.
"Litaneutria minor" uses its small size and dark coloration as its best defense against predators. Because of its dark coloration, it easily blends in with the small rocks, broken twigs and dark vegetation found in its territory. Its small size easily allows it to quickly run and hide under rocks or dense vegetation.
The agile ground mantis is extremely aggressive, and will defend itself against predators or unruly prey. It will extend its forearms out fully and stand as tall as possible to try to intimidate predators.
Many flying mantids have evolved a highly sensitive ear which is capable of detecting ultrasonic frequencies emitted by bats using echolocation. These ultrasonic frequencies range from 60–120 kHz and once detected by the mantis, the mantis can change its flight path into a series of random loops and twirls to try to evade the bat. "L. minor" however does not have a highly specialized ear and can only hear best at 30–50 kHz. This is because the mantis no longer has to use its ear to detect bats, because it no longer has the ability to fly.

<doc id="18459359" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18459359" title="Farm assurance">
Farm assurance

Farm assurance is product certification for agricultural products that emphasises the principles of quality assurance. The emphasis on quality assurance means that, in addition to product inspection, farm assurance schemes may include standards and certification for traceability, production methods, transport, and supplies.
In the United Kingdom and Australia, the major farm assurance programmes are based on a quality management system for food safety that originated with the US space agency NASA, known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In these and other countries, assurance is underpinned by principles and standards for good manufacturing practice (GMP), good agricultural practice (GAP), good hygienic practice and good trade practice.
Examples of farm assurance schemes include:
In 2004, 65% of United Kingdom farm production was farm assured, and by 2006, £6 billion worth of food was packed annually under the United Kingdom's Red Tractor farm assurance mark, including over 90% of the country's pig and dairy production.
Some farm assurance schemes are given legal force, either by use of trademarks or by oversight by government regulators of agriculture and food standards.
While mostly associated with food production, farm assurance can be applied to other agricultural products, such as textiles, flowers, tobacco and biofuels.
In order to obtain farm product certification, assurance may be required for farm supplies.
For example, the UK's Red Tractor scheme is supported by assurance programmes for fodder (UFAS, FEMAS) and fertiliser (FIAS).
Other quality standards.
Other widely used agricultural quality standards are based entirely on product inspection, and do not rely on other aspects of quality assurance.
One example of such a programme is the United States Quality Standards for grading, certification and verification: the USDA beef grades depend on physical attributes of the meat, plus the age of the animal.

Phyllovates chlorophaena

Phyllovates chlorophaea Blanchard, 1836, common name Texas Unicorn Mantis, is a species of praying mantis native to the Southern United States. Representatives of this species are also found south through northern South America.
Background.
Specimens in the United States are presently only known from southernmost Texas. The Florida record from Blatchley, 1920 is the only known record and has never been substantiated. Also, this species was described by Blanchard in 1836, not Blatchley, nearly a hundred years later.
Nymphs are handsome, brown-striped creatures that arise from small, globular oothecae that are reddish brown in color. The horn on the head is formed of two pieces and is very small in the early instars at first looking like two knobs in 1st instar. As specimens grow they overlap and appear to be a single large horn though they are not fused. The adults are not so cryptic and have bright green wings with dark brown splotches. Females form four to ten oothecae, usually on thin branches. These hatch in approximately six weeks and contain thirty to fifty eggs per ootheca. There is no ootheca diapause.

Tenodera angustipennis

"Tenodera (aridifolia) angustipennis" is a species of mantis native to Asia and nearby areas, but it has also become established in the eastern United States (introduced in 1930). Common names, Narrow-winged Mantis or Japanese Mantis or チョウセンカマキリ (translates to Joseon/Korean Mantis) in Japan or 참사마귀 and just plain 사마귀 in Korea (in Korean 사마귀 can mean the whole order of Mantodea or this specific species of praying mantis).
Description.
Size: Males 65~80mm, females 68~85mm in length. "Tenodera angustipennis" are often brown or green. "T. angustipennis" have a brown streak on each of their hind wings, while "T. sinensis" have hind wings that are completely patterned and brown. The Chinese Mantis is thicker or more stocky than the Narrow-winged Mantis. It can be easy for a person to tell apart "Tenodera angustipennis" from "Tenodera sinensis" in person from just a glance, but it is hard to distinguish the two species in photographs.

West Midlands Dudley Road bus corridor

The Dudley Road bus corridor is a collection of bus services operated in the West Midlands, United Kingdom.
History.
The routes originally formed part of a jointly-worked Birmingham City Transport / Midland Red high-frequency bus operation known as 'The Track' on account of its origins as a tramway, and with its City Centre terminus in Edmund Street in Birmingham. The original route variations and short workings comprised:-
Service 80 - Birmingham-Grove Lane
Service 81 - Birmingham - Cape Hill/Windmill Lane
Service 82 - Birmingham-Bearwood
Service 83 - Birmingham-Soho
Service 84 - Birmingham-Smethwick (Saint Paul's Road)
Service 85 - Birmingham-West Smethwick (Spon Croft)
Service 86 - Birmingham-Oldbury
Service 87 - Birmingham-Dudley
Service 88 - Dudley - Oldbury
Service 89 - Dudley - Smethwick (Grove Lane)
Services 80, 81, 82 & 83 were operated from BCT's Rosebery Street depot and Services 84-89 largely from Midland Red's Oldbury depot (though most Midland Red journeys were worked as either Service 86s or 87s). For many years, an operating agreement prevented Midland Red using their high-capacity D9 double-deckers on these routes. Up until the late 1960s buses ran with 'B' prefixs on their service number blinds (i.e.: showing B82, B87, etc.), although this practice was eventually dropped, first by BCT and then by Midland Red. The routes were wholly operated by West Midlands PTE from 1973 until deregulation in 1986. During this period, the use of some of the short working numbers ceased and by 1980 only route numbers 82, 83 and 87 were used.
A different route 88 commenced operation in August 1980, running from Birmingham via Dudley Road, Cape Hill, Smethwick Old Church, the Uplands and Londonderry (Queen's Head) to Oldbury. This was later diverted away from Oldbury to serve Causeway Green and Blackheath instead. In March 2010 service 88 was re-numbered 89 and diverted to serve Oldbury again instead of Blackheath.
For a brief period in the late 1980s West Midlands Travel extended certain 87 journey to Netherton and Cradley Heath as Service 89.
Current frequencies & allocations.
Service 82 runs every 10 minutes during the day, 15 minutes on Sunday & half hourly on evenings.
Service 87 runs every 10 minutes during the day, 15 minutes on Sunday & half hourly on evenings.
Service 89 runs every 20 minutes during the day, hourly on Sunday & half hourly on evenings.
Late evening journeys only serve between Birmingham & Smethwick.
All three services combine a frequency between Birmingham & Cape Hill, via Dudley Road of every 5 minutes during the daytime, 7/8 minutes on Sundays and every 15 minutes on evenings.
Volvo B7TL Wright Eclipse Gemini buses are allocated to routes 82 & 87 with pink 'every 5 minutes' route branding.

IFPI Greece

International Federation of the Phonographic Industry Greece, or simply IFPI Greece, is the Greek branch of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) and is the official charts provider and recording sales certification body for Greece. Currently a Top-75 combined repertoire albums sales chart is compiled. The charts is published by IFPI Greece and sponsored by Cyta Hellas. 
The domestic trade name of IFPI Greece is "Ένωση Ελλήνων Παραγωγών Ηχογραφημάτων" (ΕΕΠΗ) (English: Association of Greek Producers of Phonograms ). However, it is generally referred to, and branded as, IFPI Greece.
IFPI Greece charts.
History.
IFPI Greece founded the first official music charts in Greece in 1989. There were two top 20 albums charts, one for domestic and the other for foreign repertoire. The broadcast rights of the charts were acquired by ANT1 radio. Prior to the introduction of industry charts by IFPI Greece, unreliable charts were being published by various magazines which lacked credibility and authority over the monitoring of record sales. By May 1991, the charts were discontinued after it was discovered that they were easily manipulated. Executives blamed artists who made themselves appear more popular by buying hundreds of copies of their own albums in an attempt to gain more bargaining power for shows and appearances. Also cited was the large number of small shops which lacked detailed sales data required as a basis toward an accurate tracking system. In response to the discontinuation, Viko Antypas, managing director of PolyGram Greece, referred to the charts as "an experiment that failed".
Realizing the importance of having a national chart, which "helped bring the Greek music industry back into the public eye", IFPI sought to employ a system where albums would be tracked based upon actual sales to the public, as opposed to the number of retail shipments as was previously used. It was planned for these reformed charts to be operable by early 1992, however a complete overhaul of the charting method never materialized and future charts were once again based upon shipments, this time with adjusted figures via the sampling of record store inventories to form an estimation of actual consumer sales.
In March 2009 IFPI Greece announced that they would close their charts for a period of time in order to renew their charting system. There will be a shift from wholesale (manufacturer to retailer) to point of sale (retailer to consumer) sales, as well as the integration of legal digital downloads. The implementation of a point of sale tracking method will solve the longstanding issue of accurate consumer sales tracking, a pending issue identified since 1991 with the first discontinuation of the charts. Inclusion of digital downloads will also prompt the revival of the singles chart, as the decrease in sales and releases of CD singles had led to the discontinuation of the physical singles chart. Nielsen Soundscan is already engaged in the monitoring of digital downloads sold in Greece, which is compiled into a chart currently published under the international charts section of Billboard.
In January 2010, IFPI Greece announced that they would start providing the "Top 50 Foreign Albums" chart on their website again, although the reformed charting system is not yet functional. Thus the "Top 50 Foreign Albums" chart continues to utilize the old charting system, while it is the only chart they currently provide. IFPI debuted its new chart in early October 2010. The new chart, "Top 75 Combined Repertoire", is now the sole chart by IFPI Greece and lists the top 75 domestic and foreign albums in the country.
Current charts.
Top 75 albums.
The Top 75 Combined Repertoire chart is the official albums chart of Greece. It debuted in October 2010, replacing and combining the prior separate Greek-language and foreign album charts.
Top 200 Airplay chart.
In 2011 IFPI Greece partnered up with a new radio monitoring service called "Media Inspector" to provide an official airplay chart. The company monitors a total of more than 200 radio stations around Greece, and compiles a combined repertoire Top 200 airplay chart, part of it being available publicly accessible at www.airplaychart.gr .

Certification levels.
Foreign repertoire.
Prior to 1997, the sales thresholds for foreign repertoire were the same as domestic ones.
DVD.
Prior to July 2008, the thresholds were 5,000 and 10,000 copies, respectively.
Singles.
Prior to June 2007, the thresholds were 7,500 and 15,000 copies, respectively.
Charts of Cyprus.
The music industry of Cyprus closely mirrors that of Greece. Virtually all Greek and most of the foreign music releases are provided by the record companies in Greece. Certifications for sales of albums in Cyprus are different than that of Greece, with albums being certified Gold with sales (instead of shipments) of 3,000 copies and Platinum with sales of 6,000. (1,500 for Gold singles/DVDs and 3,000 for Platinum)
Repercussions of recording piracy.
Piracy is not a new phenomenon in the Greek music market. In the early 1980s, cassette reproduction in-home and in-store accounted for eight out of every ten in the market, however by the early 1990s that number dwindled to two out of every ten as a result of public awareness campaigns and the prosecution of key producers.
More recently Agence France-Presse noted that "CD and DVD piracy is extremely widespread in Greece, with many Greeks preferring to purchase discs from peddlers touring cafes and restaurants rather than from licensed shops, which they see as overpriced." In its July 2006 piracy report, the IFPI found that Greece, along with Italy and Spain, had alarmingly high piracy rates compared to other EU member states. Pirated product was identified to account for 50% of all music sales in Greece and the IFPI blamed "an overlenient judicial system and ineffectual policing was hampering the fight against piracy." Furthermore, the IFPI calculates a loss of profit of about 150 million euros per year as of 2006. In 2008, Kathimerini newspaper noted that sales of bootlegs is thought to have cost Greece almost €1 billion in lost taxes over a nine-year period.
Another repercussion of the rampant piracy throughout Greece is the marked deterioration in the sales certification thresholds of IFPI Greece. At a conference held in Athens in 2005, Chairman and CEO of IFPI John Kennedy stated: 
""Along with Spain, Greece is our biggest piracy problem country in Western Europe. It joins countries like Estonia, Czech Republic and Slovakia, all with piracy levels above 45%. In fact with a piracy rate of around 50%, Greece is one of the very few Western European countries where illegal music copies almost outnumber legal sales."" The sharpest decline came with the current sales levels established in September 2008 where the gold and platinum levels for Greek repertoire were reduced by 60%, from 30,000 to 12,000 units for platinum status, and from 15,000 to 6,000 units for gold status. As a result, Greece ranks amongst the lowest of EU states with regards to legal music recording sales.
More recently, following the Greek debt crisis, a trend has been established for even prominent artists to release their albums as covermounts with national Greek newspapers, usually "Real News". This facilitates a guaranteed a return for the record companies and artists in the face of otherwise low legal sales. Albums distributed in this way are not eligible for certification by IFPI Greece, so most go on to release them separately to boost sales and possibly to be certified if they gain enough sales.
Anti-piracy campaigns.
IFPI Greece runs an anti-piracy campaign with the help of the recording industry. Beginning in 2002, During IFPI Greece's first annual "Arion Music Awards", its "Piracy Kills Music" campaign was launched, aimed at raising awareness among consumers. Campaign logos would appear on almost every album release, inserted into music videos broadcasts, and public service announcements were designed as magazine and newspaper ads. The slogan was also heard regularly in radio spots of major radio stations.
From 2002 to 2004, the slogan appeared as a logo featuring an open, red-colored hand print in the background. In 2005, the logo was updated with a differently stylized straight red-colored hand containing a black disc in its palm, with the "Piracy Kills Music" slogan appearing as caption below it. In 2007, IFPI Greece changed its anti-piracy slogan to "Let Music Live" which would appear as a caption to a colorful musical note. This anti-piracy tactic of imprinting CDs and music videos appears to be fading as fewer labels have chosen to continue this practice since 2009.
Award ceremonies.
Arion Music Awards (2002–2007).
The Arion Music Awards were the official industry awards organized by Greece's charting authority, IFPI Greece. The awards are named after the Ancient Greek poet Arion as an expression of the diversity in Greek music. The awards debuted in 2002 following the discontinuation of the "Pop Corn Music Awards", which were organized by the defunct Greek magazine "Pop Corn" from the early 90's until 2001. The Arions were broadcast by Mega Channel in their first five years before moving to ANT1 channel later. In the first years, the awards were praised by industry and viewers alike, helping to demonstrate to audiences the industry behind the music and by raising awareness on issues of piracy and counterfeit CDs. They also effectively balanced the majority of genres present in the local market. The awards have been put on hiatus since 2007 for various reasons ranging from falling TV ratings, low artist attendance, and to a general crisis in Greek discography attributed to falling sales and heavy piracy. MAD Video Music Awards presented by music television station MAD TV, which primarily awards music videos, is currently the only mainstream music award in Greece.
World Music Awards.
The World Music Awards is an annual international awards ceremony since 1989 that honours recording artists from all over the world based on global sales figures provided by the IFPI. As the IFPI has significant roles and operations in Greece, it qualifies for its regional awards in the best selling artist category. The regional awards, as with many of their other awards, are not necessarily awarded annually, rather only when it is believed that an artist has sold an extraordinary amount of records for their country. "World's Best Selling Greek Artist" is therefore the title bestowed upon Greek artists, and to this date it has been awarded two times since 2002. 
The first award was given in 2002 to Despina Vandi for her album "Gia" which reached 5× platinum status, followed by Yiannis Kotsiras in 2003 for his album "Live".

The Great Dinosaur Robbery

The Great Dinosaur Robbery is a now out-of-print book released in 1970 and written by David Eliades and Robert Forrest Webb under the pseudonym of David Forrest. The book was later the basis for the 1975 film "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing".
Plot.
The book is set in New York City in the 1970s, and follows attempts by a group of British nannies who discover that a microdot containing Chinese military secrets that they believe to be vital to the survival of the British Empire has been hidden in a skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History. They cannot find the message, so contrive to steal the entire skeleton and mail it to the Queen. The Chinese agents who hope to retrieve the message, and the Americans searching for the missing dinosaur, play important roles.
Film.
The film differed greatly from the book in the sense that it was aimed at children rather than adults, with the violence toned down considerably. The setting was also changed from New York to England, principally London, and the time period changed to the 1920s. In the book, the villains were agents of communist China, but the film featured agents from post-World War I China, with the Cold War undertones practically non-existent.

Chyp-Notic

Chyp-Notic were a German Eurodance group formed in 1988, who had several hits between 1990 and 1993, including a cover of "Nothing Compares 2 U" and "I Can't Get Enough". Due to its keyboard effects and basic rhythm pattern, the latter sounded very similar to Londonbeat's "I've Been Thinking About You", but it can also be seen as a predecessor to the upcoming boy group music that started to become very popular at the time.
History.
Vlad Mint, Jan Erik and Walter Bee founded the band in 1988 under the name Toys. Two years later, the trio renamed to Chyp-Notic, and landed a recording contract with Coconut Records. Mint ended his training as a dental technician, Bee gave up his job as a computer programmer and Erik sold his shares at a nightclub.
They released their first and best-known single "Nothing Compares 2 U" in 1990. This uptempo cover of Sinéad O'Connor's cover of the Prince song reached #16 on the German singles chart. The beat is lifted from the Raze song "Break 4 Love". After two albums and several successes, including a top 20 placing for the third single "I Can't Get Enough" in 1991, the band broke up in 1994.

Salvador Toscano

Salvador Toscano Barragán (22 March 187214 April 1947), also known as Salvador Toscano, was a director, producer and distributor of early Mexican cinema films. He was Mexico's first filmmaker.
Biography.
Toscano was born in 1872 in Guadalajara, Jalisco. He began studying to become a mining engineer, however changed his career to become a filmmaker. He used a Cinematograph camera and projector which was first introduced in France in 1895. It was introduced into Mexico a year later when the first presentation of film in Mexico was made on 15 August 1896.
Toscano opened Mexico's first public movie theatre at 17 Jesús María Street in Mexico City in 1897. In the public theater he showed such famous early films as "The Great Train Robbery", "A Trip to the Moon", and "The Kingdom of the Fairies".
Toscano began his movie career by filming local scenes in Mexico and local news events. Some early short film titles of these, made in 1896 and 1897, were "Men in Scuffle on the Main Square" and "Rural Police Riding Their Horses." 
Toscano began full length production filming in 1898, directing and producing his own movies. They were mostly documentaries pertaining to Mexico. Toscano was the producer of the first full length film in Mexico. It was fiction based on the play "Don Juan Tenorio". The film was made in 1898 starring the Mexican actor Paco Gavilanes.
Toscano was a documentary filmmaker mostly however. He filmed on the Mexican Revolution and most of his movie making was on this subject. 
Toscano had a rival named Enrique Rosas who also produced films in Mexico at the same time. Many movie theaters had been constructed by 1902 in Mexico City and within a few years many more were spread throughout Mexico. Toscano's last film was shot in 1921. 
Toscano's daughter Carmen took many scenes of his Mexican revolutionary documentary films and reintroduced it under the title of "Memorias de un Mexicano" ("Memoirs of a Mexican") in 1950. The scenes were filmed by Toscano between 1897 and 1923. Much of the footage was about President Porfirio Díaz and the revolutionary events of his reign. The reintroduced film was 100 minutes long and premiered 24 August 1950.
One of the propaganda "photo-ops" Toscano made of Díaz was called "General Díaz on a Stroll Through Chapultepec Park." Toscano also made documentary films of Díaz's grand celebration of Mexico's first one hundred years of independence.
Since 1982 the movie industry of Mexico has awarded the Salvador Toscano Medal in recognition of outstanding contribution to Mexican cinematography.

.56-56 Spencer

The .56-56 Spencer was an American black powder rifle cartridge.
Designed for the Spencer rifle and carbine, patented 6 March 1860, it was employed by cavalry during the American Civil War, first appearing at Sharpsburg in rifle form. No Spencer carbines were on issue at the Battle of Gettysburg, though two units under Custer had the rifles. The .56-56 was loaded with a slug of 350–360 gr (22.7–23.3 g) over 42–45 gr (2.7–2.9 g) of black powder. It was loaded by a variety of companies, and was also used in the Ballard and Joslyn carbines. It is a short-ranged cartridge, ineffective on anything larger than deer. Commercially loaded ammunition continued to be available into the 1920s.
Nomenclature.
The nomenclature of Spencer cartridges were unique. Unlike later cartridges such as the .44-40 Winchester and .45-70, where the first number indicated caliber and the second the charge weight, the .56-56 refers solely to the case. The first 56 is the diameter of the case at the base .56 inches (14.2 mm), measured just past the rim, and the second 56 is the diameter at the case mouth, also . Later versions of the cartridge included the .56-52, .56-50, and .56-46, which had varying degrees of taper in the cases, to accommodate smaller diameter bullets. All of these cartridges are rimfire primed. The actual bullet diameter of the .56-56 varied between .54 and .555 inches (13.7–14.1 mm), depending on ammunition manufacturer. The .56-52, made by Spencer, and the .56-50, made by Springfield, differed only in the degree of crimp, with the .56-50 having a greater crimp; both fired 350 grain bullets. The .56-46 fired a 320 to 330 grain bullet.

Agapius of Hierapolis

Agapius son of Constantine (arabised as Mahbūb ibn-Qūṣṭānṭīn) (d.941-2 AD) was a 10th-century Arabic Christian writer, best known for his lengthy "Kitab al-'Unwan" ("Book of headings" or "History"). He was the Melkite bishop of Manbij (Mabbug, Hierapolis Bambyce). 
He was a contemporary of the annalist Eutychius (=Said al-Bitriq), also a Melchite. His history commences with the foundation of the world and runs up to his own times. The portion dealing with the Arabic period is extant only in a single manuscript and breaks off in the second year of the Caliphate of al-Mahdi (160AH = 776-7 AD). 
For the early history of Christianity, Agapius made use uncritically of apocryphal and legendary materials. For the following secular and ecclesiastical history, he relied on Syriac sources, in particular the World Chronicle of the Maronite historian Theophilus of Edessa (d. 785) for the end of the Ummayad period and the beginning of the Abbasids. He made use of Eusebius's "Church History" only through an intermediary compilation of short extracts. This he supplements from other sources. He gives an otherwise unknown fragment of Papias; and a list of Eastern Metropolitans. He uses the lost History of Bardaisan, but many of his sources remain unknown. 
The "History" has been published with a French translation in the Patrologia Orientalis series and with a Latin translation in the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium series.
Testimonium Flavianum.
His history contains an interesting version of the Testimonium Flavianum.

Daily News (Harare)

The Daily News is a Zimbabwean independent newspaper published in Harare. It was founded in 1999 by Geoffrey Nyarota, a former editor of the "Bulawayo Chronicle". Bearing the motto "Telling it like it is", the "Daily News" swiftly became Zimbabwe's most popular newspaper. However, the paper also suffered two bombings, allegedly by Zimbabwean security forces. Nyarota was arrested six times and reportedly was the target of a government assassination plot. After being forced from the paper by new management in December 2002, Nyarota left Zimbabwe. The "News" was banned by the government in September 2003.
In May 2010, a government commission granted the paper the right to re-open.
Founding.
In 1989, Geoffrey Nyarota helped to break the Willowgate scandal with the "Bulawayo Chronicle". The investigation led to the resignation of five ministers of President Robert Mugabe's government, but also resulted in Nyarota being removed from his post.
After some years in exile, Nyarota founded the "Daily News", an independent daily newspaper, in 1999. The paper stated that it would be neither "pro-government" nor "anti-government", but would "be a medium for vibrant discourse among the divergent political, social, religious and other groups of Zimbabwe", as well as fight for press freedom and freedom of speech. Its first issue appeared on 21 March 1999. The newspaper's motto was "Telling it like it is".
Within a year, the newspaper had passed the circulation of the state-owned "Herald", with a daily circulation of 105,000 copies; the "Herald"'s circulation was reported to have fallen by 50% during the same period.
Conflict with Mugabe government.
President Mugabe accused the paper of being a "mouthpiece" for the Movement for Democratic Change, a political coalition opposed to his rule, while Nyarota asserted that the paper was independent and criticized both parties.
During his editorship of the "Daily News", Nyarota was arrested six times. On 1 August 2000, the "News" reported that Zimbabwe's secret police, the Central Intelligence Organisation, had sent a man named Bernard Masara to kill Nyarota; however, after meeting Nyarota in a lift, Masara changed his mind and warned him of the plot. Masara then called his employer with the paper's editors listening so that they could verify the source of the plan.
On 22 April 2000, a bomb was thrown into the paper's offices, but no one was hurt. South African Associated Press photographer Obed Zilwa was arrested for the attack, but the newspaper alleged that agents of Mugabe's security forces had thrown the bomb.Zilwa was released without charge 48 hours later. In January 2001, the "News" building was bombed again, this time destroying its printing presses. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, "credible sources" linked the Zimbabwean military to the attack.
The paper also came into conflict with the pro-ZANU Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA), an organization accused by human rights and opposition groups of voter intimidation and invading white-owned farms on behalf of Mugabe's government. On 6 June 2000, the group's head, Chenjerai Hunzvi, warned that he was giving the paper its "last warning" to stop criticizing Mugabe. Three days later, ZNLWVA members took the paper from newsstands in Kwekwe and burned them. The following month, ZNLWVA members severely beat "News" staffer Chengetai Zvauya for his reporting on the group.
On 30 December 2002, Nyarota resigned as editor of the "Daily News", to avoid his firing by the paper's new executive chair. The paper was shut down by the government in September 2003. A court order stated that the paper could re-open in December of that year, but when the paper prepared an eight-page edition for release, riot police arrived to shut down their printing press and blockade the building. Four top members of the "News" staff were charged with illegal attempts to publish, but were acquitted in September 2004.
2010 return.
In May 2010, a governmental media commission granted the right to publish a daily newspaper to four publications, among them the "Daily News".
Awards.
During Nyarota's tenure as editor-in-chief, he won several awards for his work with the "News". In 2001, the Committee to Protect Journalists awarded him its International Press Freedom Award, which recognizes journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. The World Association of Newspapers awarded him its Golden Pen of Freedom Award in 2002. That same year he was also awarded UNESCO's Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

Count Ferdinand Troyer (February 1, 1780 – July 23, 1851) was an Austrian noble, philanthropist, and amateur clarinettist.
Born in Brünn (Brno), Moravia, Troyer became the chief steward to Archduke Rudolf of Austria-Tuscany. It was noted that on 2 March 1817, Troyer played the obbligato to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Parto" for the Vienna Philharmonic Society at the Large Ridotto Room. His sound was described as being "sensitive," with an "extremely tender handling" of the clarinet. 
Because of the popularity of Ludwig van Beethoven's E-flat Septet, in early 1824, Troyer commissioned Franz Schubert to write a companion piece. Schubert accepted the commission but enriched the seven-part instrumentation of Beethoven's septet with an additional violin to create an octet. The octet was completed on 1 March 1824 and was first performed at Troyer's townhouse in Vienna where Troyer himself played the clarinet part. He died in Vienna.

Linda Lovelace for President

Linda Lovelace for President is a 1975 David Winters comedy film directed by Claudio Guzman and starring Linda Lovelace, who achieved notoriety as the central character in the 1972 most profitable X-rated film of all time "Deep Throat".
Plot.
A committee of independent U.S. political party leaders have gathered to join forces and select a candidate for the upcoming presidential election. One of the committee members flippantly suggests nominating Linda Lovelace. The committee approaches the porn star, who agrees to be the flag bearer of the newly formed Upright Party. Lovelace’s campaign takes her on a cross-country tour, where she meets voters in stops ranging from crowded big cities to isolated rural towns. Lovelace’s popularity, however, threatens the Washington, D.C., establishment, and her political rivals dispatch a hit man known as The Assassinator to bring a fatal end to the Lovelace campaign.
Production.
After the 1972 release of "Deep Throat", Linda Lovelace enjoyed a brief flurry of celebrity notoriety while dating David Winters of West Side Story fame, which included appearances at the Academy Awards ceremony with Winters and the opening day of the racing season at Ascot Racecourse plus author credit for two best-selling books that played up on her status as a pornographic icon. By 1974, however, her career stalled. An R-rated sequel to her breakthrough film, "Deep Throat Part II", was commercially unsuccessful, and her attempts to establish success as a nightclub singer and stage actress were considered failures. The film "Linda Lovelace for President" was designed by David Winters to establish the star’s crossover appeal with mainstream moviegoers. Winters came up with the idea for the film after observing the strong positive reaction that college students exhibited towards Linda Lovelace during her speeches at various college campuses. 
The film brought in several recognizable actors for guest appearances. Featured in the film were Micky Dolenz of The Monkees, whom Winters knew from the days he directed and choreographed two episodes of "The Monkees", as a near-sighted bus driver, Scatman Crothers as a pool hall hustler, Joe E. Ross as a political operative, Vaughn Meader as a preacher who lusts after Lovelace, and Chuck McCann as The Assassinator. However, much of the film played up Lovelace's starring role in "Deep Throat" with jokey reminders of the X-rated film's oral sex subject matter (i.e., the slogan for the Lovelace campaign is "A vote for Linda is a blow for democracy").
Lovelace’s boyfriend at the time, David Winters, was one of the film’s producers.
Part of the film was shot on the campus of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, and at Swope Park in Kansas City, Missouri.
Reception.
"Linda Lovelace for President" was theatrically released in X-rated, R-rated and PG-rated versions. None of these versions were commercially successful. Linda Lovelace made no further films after this production.
Over the years, bootleg versions of "Linda Lovelace for President" were released on home video. A commercial DVD version was scheduled for release in August 2008 on the Dark Sky/MPI label.

<doc id="18459878" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18459878" title="Miraj Nameh">
Miraj Nameh

Miraj Nameh (Mirâj Nâmeh) is an illustrated Turkish book from the fifteenth century that contains magnificent paintings and artworks of a Turkish painter and artist. Although little is known about his life and work, this is the only book that survives. It prompted great curiosity and admiration between art lovers and historians, while causing anger and suspicion in the religious extremist followers of Islam.
Work.
The most important work from this book is "The Miraculous Journey of Mohammed", which tells of the ascension of Muhammad to heaven. It was composed between 1436 and 1437 (840 in the Islamic calendar).
Inspired by the first verse from Sura XVII, "al-Isra," the Koran, which states "praised be He, who led his servant by night from the holy mosque in Mecca to more distant temple of Jerusalem, whose surroundings … blessed." The "trip of the night" appears as a climb during which the angel Gabriel led the "holy mosque in Mecca to" the most distant mosque "in Jerusalem, and thence to the Seventh Heaven, where they received the founder of Islam in ecstatic contemplation of the divine essence. In the first centuries of the Hejira, this story led to the creation of other popular Arabic stories and then, after theological progress, mystics and literary, were gradually integrated into Muslim belief. 
Composed by the poet Mir Haydar, with calligraphy by Malik Bakhshi of Herat, written in eastern Turkish and scribed in the Uighur script, this manuscript is decorated with illustrations of sixty-one Miraj Nameh. 
This manuscript was created in the fifteenth century, in the workshops of Herat in Khorasan, at the request of Shah Rukh, son of Timur the Lame. Subsequently, it was bought in 1673, in Constantinople, the famous translator of The Thousand and One Nights, Antonie Galland (1646-1715).. Taken to France, the book stayed in the library of Colbert. The manuscript was acquired by the National Library of France, ranked among the "Supplements Turks" with the number 190.
Illustrations.
The book contains an illustration called "The tree of Mohammed," in which Muhammad is represented alongside a tree of rubies, sapphires and emeralds, possibly a Turgo tree like the one that stands in the center of Muslim paradise.
Prohibition of his work.
Because the book makes physical representations of people sacred to Islam it is banned in some places.
Influences from the West.
Similarities in the illustrations have been perceived between the manuscript of Nameh and images of Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy. The author possibly drew on it, especially in Chapter hell, to compose some drawings in the book.

Assistant director to Luis Buñuel on "L'Âge d'or", he appeared in more than 30 movies, using several alternate names: Jacques Borel, J.B. Brunius, Jacques-Bernard Brunius, Jacques Brunius, Brunius, J.B.Brunius. He acted in many of the early, more political, movies of his friend Jean Renoir. He married French-English actress Cecile Chevreau in 1951. Their son Richard was born in 1956.
Member of the surrealist group in France and then in England, with his friend E.L.T. Mesens, Conroy Maddox, Ithell Colquhoun, Simon Watson Taylor and Roland Penrose. Brunius attacked Toni del Renzio, who was attempting to reanimate an inactive English group in 1942–3. Brunius' countersigned the tract "Idolatry and Confusion", which condemned and mocked del Renzio unjustifiably. In reality, Mesens feared a takeover of the group leadership by del Renzio.
He never missed an opportunity to defend surrealism, and participated in many a radio show. In 1959, he undertook a vigorous defense of the poetic valor of nursery rhymes.

Gavit

A gavit (Armenian or ) or "zhamatun" (Armenian: ) is often contiguous to the west of a church in a Medieval Armenian monastery. It served as narthex (entrance to the church), mausoleum and assembly room.
History.
The "gavit", the distinctive Armenian style of narthex, appeared in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The first were located in the south of the Armenia in the region of Syunik. The type of construction changed during the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, as found in the monasteries of Saghmosavank of Haritchavank, or Hovhannavank Monastery. The gavit changed again in the late thirteenth century as can be seen in monasteries such as Gandzasar. Gavits gradually ceased to be built in the late Middle Ages.
Structure.
The earliest style of "gavit" consists of an oblong vault supported by double arches, with an "erdik" (lantern) center. This form was replaced by a square room with four columns, divided into nine sections with a dome in the center. The last evolution consists of a gavit without columns and with arched ceilings.
On the west side of the Church of the Holy Redeemer in the Sanahin Monastery complex, the gavit built in 1181 has four tall free-standing internal pillars supporting arches, The pillars and their bases are elaborately decorated. In the same complex, the "gavit" of the Mother of God church is a three-nave hall with lower arches and less elaborate decorations on the pillars.

Adlersparre

Adlersparre is a Swedish noble family, which is descended from the mayor of Bogesund (which is now named Ulricehamn) Christopher Andersson, who was active during the earlier half of the 17th century.
His male-line great-grandson, the captain at Jämtland's regiment, and later lieutenant colonel Christopher Christophersson (1718-1799), was ennobled 1 December 1757 at Stockholm Palace by King Adolphus Frederick of Sweden with the name Adlersparre and was introduced at the Swedish house of nobility 29 April 1773 as noble family number 1988.
One of his sons, the cabinet minister and later one of the lords of the realm, the governor of Skaraborgs län and the major general Georg Adlersparre (1760-1835), was created a Swedish baron 29 June 1809 and thus founded the baronial family Adlersparre.
Other members of the family include the painter Sofia Adlersparre (1808-1862) and the feminist Sophie Adlersparre (1823-1895).

<doc id="18460129" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18460129" title="Seratrodast">
Seratrodast

Seratrodast (INN) is a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor (TP receptor) antagonist used primarily in the treatment of asthma. It was the first TP receptor antagonist that was developed as an anti-asthmatic drug and received marketing approval in Japan in 1997. Seratrodast is currently marketed in Japan, China and India (approved in Dec 2012) as an add-on controller therapy in the management of asthma.
Unlike thromboxane synthase inhibitors, like Ozagrel, Seratrodast does not affect thrombus formation, time to occlusion and bleeding time. Seratrodast has no effect on prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, thus ruling out any action on blood coagulation cascade.
Pharmacodynamics.
TXA2 and other bronchoconstrictor prostanoids, like PGD2 and PGF2α, are generated in asthma and participate in acute and chronic inflammatory processes. Seratrodast, being a TP receptor antagonist, inhibits the following pathophysiological processes in asthma:
Airway smooth muscle contraction.
Ligand binding studies on TP receptors have shown the existence of TP receptors on airway smooth muscle. Experimental studies have indicated that the contractile potency of TXA2 is about two times more potent than other prostaglandins. Experiments utilizing several TP receptor antagonists have further supported the view that not only TXA2 but even PGF2α, PGD2 and its metabolite 9α,11β-PGF2 contract airway smooth muscle via direct stimulation of TP receptors, indicating the involvement of TP receptors in airway smooth muscle contractions. In studies, Seratrodast competitively inhibited the contractile response to the TXA2 mimetic (analogue), PGD2, 9α,11β-PGF2 and PGF2α. Other than inhibition of actions of prostanoids, Seratrodast, when given orally, inhibited bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs induced by leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and platelet activating factor (PAF).
Vascular smooth muscle contraction.
Activation of vascular TP receptors has been observed to invariably induce vasoconstriction. The same has been illustrated by "in vitro" potency and efficacy of TXA2 in inducing constriction of internal mammary arteries. Seratrodast competitively inhibited the contractile response to TXA2 mimetic (analogue) in guinea pig lung parenchymal strips and dog saphenous vein strips. In anesthetized rabbits, Seratrodast abolished the decrease in internal diameter of small pulmonary arteries in response to TXA2 mimetic (analogue), indicating direct role of activation of TP receptors in vascular smooth muscle contraction.
Plasma extravasation.
TXA2 and PGF2α potently induce plasma exudation in airways. Studies have indicated inhibition of PAF- or leukotriene D4 (LTD4)-induced plasma exudation by TP receptor antagonists, suggesting that TXA2 is endogenously released in response to inflammatory mediators other than prostanoids resulting in airway microvascular leakage.
Neuromodulatory effects.
Prostanoids have potent neuromodulatory effects. Experimental studies on isolated arterial preparation have suggested that TXA2 and related prostaglandins may have some vascular effects on adrenergic fibres that have been found to be in close association with bronchial vessels. TXA2 has also been implicated in acting presynaptically to enhance the release or duration of release of acetylcholine, a potent bronchoconstrictor, from cholinergic nerves.
Mucous secretion.
Prostanoids such as PGF2α and PGD2 have been observed to significantly increase mucous glycoprotein release, while TXA2 has been shown to increase tracheal mucous gel layer. Antagonism of TP receptor was not only observed to inhibit the tracheal mucous gel layer response of TXA2, but was also found to attenuate the mucous gel layer response caused by leukotrienes, indicating an indirect link between leukotrienes and TP receptors.
Smooth muscle proliferation.
TXA2 elicits the proliferation of human airway smooth muscle cells as well as vascular smooth muscle cells, thus participating in airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia.
Airway hyper-responsiveness.
The effects of TXA2 and related prostaglandins on plasma exudation, acetylcholine release and smooth muscle proliferation support the potential role of TP receptor stimulation in the pathogenesis of airway hyper-responsiveness. The airway mucosal edema due to plasma exudation and the smooth muscle proliferation contribute to thickening of the airway wall Plasma exudation leads to liquid filling of the airway interstices formed between luminal epithelial projections, which amplify the luminal narrowing due to airway smooth muscle contraction.
In addition to inhibition of actions of prostanoids, TP receptor antagonism has been shown to prevent increased airway reactivity to allergens, PAF, LTC4, D4, and B4, bradykinin, endothelin, endotoxin, and ozone.
Pharmacokinetics.
The pharmacokinetics of Seratrodast have been studied in Japanese and Caucasian, including Indian, healthy volunteers. The plasma concentrations of Seratrodast increase with increasing doses. The absorption of Seratrodast is relatively rapid with maximum plasma concentrations of 4.6-6 µg/ml obtained in 3 to 4 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations of seratrodast are reached within 4–5 days. Seratrodast is slowly cleared, mainly by hepatic biotransformation. The drug shows biexponential decay in plasma profiles with a mean elimination half-life of 22 hours. Approximately 20% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, with 60% of the urinary recovery being in the form of conjugates 
Dosage and administration.
Recommended dosage.
The average recommended dose of Seratrodast is 80mg once daily. Seratrodast has been well tolerated following repeated once daily oral doses of up to a maximum of 320mg. In elderly patients it is recommended that the treatment should be started with a lower dose of 40mg/day.
Pregnancy and lactation.
There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Seratrodast in pregnant women. The drug should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the risk to the fetus. Seratrodast should not be used during lactation.
Pediatric use.
The safety and efficacy of Seratrodast has not been established in children (< 18 years of age).
Clinical experience.
The efficacy and safety of seratrodast has been established through various clinical studies conducted on over 5000 patients in indications like asthma, perennial allergic rhinitis, chronic bronchitis and chronic pulmonary emphysema.
Asthma.
In various clinical studies, seratrodast improved lung function parameters such as FEV1, FVC and PEF, and clinical symptoms of asthma such as wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, expectoration and chest tightness. The improvement in PEF with seratrodast (80 mg o.d. for 28 days) was found to be significantly greater than Montelukast (10 mg o.d. for 28 days). With respect to the levels of various biochemical parameters of sputum, seratrodast showed significant reduction in sputum fucose, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and albumin levels. The decrease in sputum ECP and albumin levels with seratrodast was found to be better than Montelukast In a 6-week comparative clinical study with zafirlukast 20 mg, seratrodast was observed to have a better control over asthma compared to zafirlukast (71.68% vs. 62.62%). Seratrodast (80 mg o.d.) administered over 12 weeks was found to decrease airway hyper-responsiveness to acetylcholine with significant improvement in PEF, clinical symptoms of asthma and sputum ECP levels. In a 6-week clinical study with seratrodast (40 mg o.d.), significant decrease in the amount and dynamic viscosity of sputum, and reduction in nasal clearance time of saccharin particle were observed. Long term administration of seratrodast (80 mg o.d.) over 2 years was observed to lessen exacerbation rate of asthma in patient after first 12 months of therapy and reduce the average dose of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (iBDP).
Perennial allergic rhinitis.
Seratrodast has been observed to show improvement in nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and sneezing in patients with allergic rhinitis. Improvement rates of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and sneezing with Seratrodast (80 mg/day) were found to be better than terfenadine (120 mg/day). Concomitant use with Mequitazine was found to have better impact on nasal symptoms than using Mequitazine alone, though there was no significant difference in improvement rate between concomitant group and Seratrodast group. Dose dependent increase in improvement rates of nasal symptoms has been observed with Seratrodast, with equivalent efficacy of 80 mg/day and 120 mg/day dosage of Seratrodast. Seratrodast (80 mg o.d.) administered over 4 weeks was found to significantly improve nasal volume and cross-sectional area. Long term administration of Seratrodast (80 mg o.d.) over 24 weeks was found to be highly effective in treating allergic rhinitis with significant reduction in nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and sneezing.
Chronic bronchitis.
In patients with chronic bronchitis, Seratrodast (80 mg o.d. for 4 weeks) was observed to significantly increase the cough threshold compared to placebo, while pranlukast (112.5 mg o.d. for 4 weeks) did not have any impact on the same.
COPD.
Seratrodast (80 mg o.d.), administered over 8 weeks in patients with chronic pulmonary emphysema, was shown to significantly improve respiratory distress, evaluated on both the Hugh-Jones classification and the Borg scale, with significant improvement in FVC. Plasma levels of 11-dehydro-TXB2 were also observed to decrease significantly by the end of 8 weeks.
Smoker's cough.
There are anecdotal evidences of improvement of cough with once daily dosage of seratrodast. Various experimental studies have been conducted providing fresh evidence for reducing the incidence of smokers cough.
Safety and tolerability.
In post-marketing study conducted in over 4000 patients by the innovator, the most frequently observed (0.1 to 5%) adverse reactions were elevated levels of liver enzymes such as ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and γ-GTP, nausea, loss of appetite, stomach discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, taste disturbance, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, palpitations and malaise. Less than 0.1% of patients experienced vomiting, thrombocytopenia, epistaxis, bleeding tendency, insomnia, tremor, numbness, hot flushes and edema. All the adverse reactions reported were of mild to moderate severity, and resolved when the drug was discontinued.
In clinical studies with Seratrodast, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events when compared with Montelukast. Global assessment towards the therapy with Seratrodast was deemed as “satisfactory-to-excellent” by the investigators. No difference in overall drug compliance was observed with Seratrodast when compared with Montelukast (99.02% vs. 98.06%).
Synthesis.
Seratrodast can be prepared in five steps starting from pimelic acid monoester.

Triple Peel on Opponent

A Triple Peel on Opponent (TPO) is a standard manoeuvre in top-level games of croquet. A prerequisite is that the opponent has one ball whose next hoop is 4-back (so it has three hoops still to run); it is usually performed when the opponent's other ball is still on first hoop. The striker peels the opponent's ball through its last three hoops and pegs it out. On successful completion the striker has both balls on the lawn, while the opponent has only one ball, positioned at hoop 1. A TPO leaves the opponent with few options in the remainder of the game since any shot available will be long and difficult.

Atelier-Théâtre Burkinabé

The Atelier-Théâtre Burkinabé (ATB) is a Burkinabé theatre group which practises "theatre for development".
Overview.
The ATB was founded on June 18, 1978 by Prosper Komparoré. Inspired by his Komparoré's own heritage, and by the forum theatre technique of Brazilian playwright Augusto Boal, the ATB focuses on the participation and creativity of the audience. The audience are encouraged to take part in debates following the productions, where they critique the actors' performances and create different scenarios. The theme of the productions generally revolve around economic, social, technical or cultural development and are known as "social theatre" or "theatre for development". The group established a permanent headquarters in Ouagadougou in June 1991.
The ATB is made up of volunteer actors, and includes children, who are taught by adult actors. Every year, the ATB produces about 10 plays in major cities, and approximately 30 forum theatre pieces in towns and villages. In 1999, Komparoré opened a centre for theatrical arts at the ATB for the purpose of training animateurs and entrepreneurs.

Antithesis (Origin album)

Antithesis is the fourth studio album by technical death metal band Origin. It was released through Relapse Records, on April 1, 2008. It peaked at #21 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Greg Prato awarded the album 3.5 stars stating "Although death metal and prog metal are usually thought of as two different subgenres of heavy metal, in certain cases, there's really not much differentiating the two. Case in point, Origin, and their 2008 release, Antithesis. Although they are extreme sounding in just about every way imaginable (guttural growls, stop-start riffing, metronome-perfect drumming, etc.), the instrumental prowess of Origin's players is mighty impressive here. But be forewarned -- there's not an ounce of melody detected anywhere (just front to back metallic brutality), as evidenced by such over the top assaults as the album opener, "The Aftermath," as well as "Consuming Misery" and "Wrath of Vishnu," among others. Whether you love it or hate it, most would have to agree that Origin's Antithesis is certainly death metal at its most complex and challenging. ".
According to "Kerrang!" which gave the album 4 stars, the band "...once again pack in more untrammelled ferocity and sheer sonic destruction then can be good for anyone's health". "The album hurtles by on a torrent of almost inhuman blasting, technical fret mangling and the vomitous vocal of James Lee. While there is always a problem that music that relentless can become a little one-dimensional, the blistering intensity demands your attention from violent start to battered finish", reviewer Dan Slesser writes, picking out "the jaw-dropping" 9.5 minute closing title track as the CD's highlight which "definitely slams the door in the face of all corners".
Track listing.
The quote before the title track Antithesis is from J. Robert Oppenheimer. He is best known for his role as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project: the World War II effort to develop the first nuclear weapons at the secret Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. In reference to the Trinity test in New Mexico, where his Los Alamos team first tested the bomb, Oppenheimer famously recalled the Bhagavad Gita: "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
Antithesis was ranked # 7 on Decibel Magazine's Top 40 Metal Releases of 2008
Antithesis was ranked # 6 on Metal Maniacs Top 40 metal Releases of 2008
The Antithesis album poster appears in the movie "The Crazies"
At 25:42 in the movie GAMER you will see the cover of Antithesis
The cover bears strong resemblance to a portrait of a xenomorph that was painted by H.R. Giger.
Was released as CD & limited edition Colored Vinyl
Ranked # 85 on Decibel Magazine's Top 100 Death Metal Albums of All Time

<doc id="18460335" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18460335" title="Ramp up">
Ramp up

Ramp up is a term used in economics and business to describe an increase in firm production ahead of anticipated increases in product demand. Alternatively, ramp up describes the period between product development, and maximum capacity utilization, characterized by product and process experimentation and improvements.
Ramp up typically occurs when a company strikes a deal with a distributor, retailer, or producer, which will substantially increase product demand. For example, in June, 2008, after launching a joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile, Toyota announced that it would “ramp up” production in China to meet expected increases in market demand by constructing a plant in Guangdong, which would produce some 120,000 additional Camry sedans.
As ramp up is typical in early stages of firm or market development, the term and process is widely associated with venture capital, which seek to rapidly increase rate of return on investment, just prior to exit. For example, Wrightspeed, the producer of the X1 electric car prototype, began to seek out capital in order to hire on 50 well-trained employees in order to “ramp up” production in anticipation of sales successes.

2008–09 EDF Energy Cup

The 2008-09 Anglo-Welsh Cup, known as the EDF Energy Cup for sponsorship reasons, was the 38th season of England's national rugby union cup competition, and the fourth to follow the recently adopted Anglo-Welsh format.
As in the previous two years, the competition is contested between the twelve teams of the Guinness Premiership and the four Welsh regions from the Magners League. The sixteen teams are arranged into four pools, with one Welsh and three English teams in each. Teams are randomly drawn into groups, as opposed to previous years when English sides were grouped according to proximity to one another. Each team plays the other team from their group only once, meaning that two teams in each group face two away games, whereas the other two teams have two home games.
Group stage.
In the pool matches, teams receive:
The winner of each pool advances to the semi-finals, at which stage a draw takes place to determine the teams that will play each other. The winners of the semi-final advance to the final to determine the competition winner; no "third place final" is played.

Ingersoll Watch Company

The Ingersoll Watch Company has been bankrupt since 1921. The brand is currently owned by Zeon Watches a British subsidiary of the Chinese company Herald Group [http://www.heraldgroup.com.hk/corporate_information.htm, headed by Tsang-Kay Cheung [http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/senate/hdr/1053.html]. The brand originated in the US, but has been sold several time since the bankruptcy of the Ingersoll Watch Company.
Origins.
The Ingersoll Watch Company grew out of a mail order business (R H Ingersoll & Bro) started in New York City in 1882 by 21-year-old Robert Hawley Ingersoll and his brother Charles Henry. The company initially sold low-cost items such as rubber stamps. The first watches were introduced into the catalogue in 1892, supplied by the Waterbury Clock Company.
In 1896 Ingersoll introduced the "Yankee" watch priced at $1.00. It was cheaply mass produced from stamped parts and without jewels so that it would be affordable to everyone. They were producing 8,000 per day by 1899, and started advertising that 10,000 dealers carried their "dollar watch." By 1910, Waterbury Clock was producing 3,500,000 "dollar watches" per year for Ingersoll. Over twenty years nearly forty million of these watches were sold, and Ingersoll coined the phrase "The watch that made the dollar famous!" Theodore Roosevelt mentioned that during his hunting trip in Africa he was described as "the man from the country where Ingersoll was produced." 
In 1904 Ingersoll opened a store in London, England. In 1905 Robert sailed to England and introduced the "Crown" pocket watch for 5 shillings, which was the same value as $1 at the time. These were made by a British subsidiary, Ingersoll Ltd, initially assembled from imported parts, and later made entirely in their London factory. These watches were made until the late 1920s, after the American parent company had collapsed.
Ingersoll bought the Trenton Watch Company in 1908, and the bankrupt New England Watch Company in Waterbury, Connecticut, for $76,000 on November 25, 1914. By 1916, the company was producing 16,000 watches per day in 10 different models. In 1917 they produced another popular watch with 7 jewels called the "Reliance". In 1919 Ingersoll developed a watch with the so-called "night design", the "Radiolite" with luminous dial.
Bankruptcy.
Ingersoll Watch Company went bankrupt in 1921 during the recession that followed World War I. It was purchased by Waterbury Clock Company in 1922 for $1,500,000. Waterbury Clock sold the London-based arm of the Ingersoll watch business, Ingersoll, Ltd., to its Board of Directors in 1930, making it a wholly British-owned enterprise. In 1944 Waterbury Clock Company was renamed United States Time Corporation (now Timex Group USA) and continued producing Ingersoll watches in the United States through the 1950s.
Anglo-Celtic Company Ltd.
After the Second World War, the British company, Ingersoll Ltd, joined with Smiths Industries Ltd and Vickers Armstrong in setting up the Anglo-Celtic Company Ltd on the Ynyscedwyn estate. This was on the outskirts of the village of Ystradgynlais, near Swansea, Wales. The first model featured the same movement as the earlier British Ingersolls, now designated calibre PY. These watches were branded Ingersoll Triumph and Smiths Empire. Ingersoll Ltd pulled out of the venture in 1969. Between 1946 and 1980, when the factory closed down, over 30,000,000 watches were made, and exported to 60 different countries throughout the world. They also made many character pocket watches, of many different subjects from the 1930s Prewar years 1933–1939 - Betty Boop, Big Bad Wolf, Buck Rogers, Dizzy Dean, Donald Duck, Flash gordon, Lone Ranger, Mickey Mouse, Moon Mullins, Popeye, Rudy Nebb, Skeezix, Smitty, Three Little Pigs, Tom MixSmiths, Ingersoll (Anglo-Celtic) - Ranger, Jamboree, Football (blue & yellow skies), the 1953 coronation watches, the Guinness automaton & cross bottle watches, the 1951 'From Outer Space' and the Esquire magazine watches . Postwar years 1946–1958 - Captain Marvel, Captain Midnight, Dan Dare (shown shooting monster with moving arm, revolving space dial, and Eagle logo on watch case), Dick Tracy, Donald Duck, Hopalong cassidy, Jeff Arnold, Peter Pan. then in Great Britain several Eagle comic watches were made including, Dan Dare red Label with moving arm and Rocket Ship and word Ingersoll, Dan Dare Black Label with no Ingersoll writing just the word Dan Dare, Ingersoll Jeff Arnold with moving arm, then Ingersoll Jeff Arnold without the word Ingersoll, then Jeff Arnold without the moving arm (this model is very scarce and was part of a late production run of approx 1,500 watches so if you have this model it's quite collectable) 1958–1972 - Buck Rogers, Buster brown, Charlie Chaplin, Flash Gordon, Marilyn Monroe, Mickey & Minnie, Roy Rogers, Superman, Valentino.
Smith Watches were sold in the early 1980s to another company who bought all the rights; they have since made Combat watches, Timex, Aircraft plus many more makes without even names on them, but all Smiths-cased dollar watches. Over 100 character watches were made by unknown companies. There are lots of different designs out there, including many advertising Pocket Watches Double Diamond and Players Please, to name a few.
Today: a brand owned by a Hong Kong company.
The brand "Ingersoll" is currently owned by Zeon Watches a British subsidiary of the Chinese company Herald Group [http://www.heraldgroup.com.hk/corporate_information.htm, headed by Tsang-Kay Cheung [http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/senate/hdr/1053.html].

Charles Elworthy (scientist)

Charles Elworthy (born 1961) is a New Zealand economist and social scientist.
Academic and Professional Activities.
Elworthy is a Visiting Business Fellow at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford, and the Head of Research at Craigmore Sustainables. He also teaches as a professor at Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), the University of Szczecin (Poland), and as a Privatdozent at the Free University of Berlin (Germany).
Elworthy’s research approach was fundamentally shaped while at Cambridge through Douglass North’s supervisions on the New Institutional Economics. This was complemented by an introduction to alternative psychological models and their implications for political behaviour and international relations at Yale. These foundations were combined in his doctoral research on the evolutionary foundations of human behaviour and his later work on the interaction between governance structures and behaviour.
In his dissertation, published in 1993 in Berlin, Elworthy created the model of "Homo biologicus" which explains human behaviour in terms of evolutionary theory and phylogenetic and ontogenetic development. "Homo biologicus" is linked to, but extends, the economic Homo economicus model, which describes man as a rational and self-interested being. The core hypothesis is derived from evolutionary psychology, and proposes that human psychological processes were shaped by natural and sexual selection to solve evolutionarily relevant problems. Some of these relate to somatic effort, and are economic in nature, while others relate to reproductive and social behaviour which are inexplicable within a conventional Homo economicus paradigm. Elworthy's theory stands in the tradition of authors like E. O. Wilson or Richard Dawkins, who are controversial among social scientists and frequently criticized for their alleged biologism. In later academic work Elworthy examines on the interactions between social institutions and human psychology and the behaviour that results. His habilitation analyses constitutional developments in New Zealand, and their enabling role in the dramatic liberalisation of 1984-1993. His most recent research focuses on the global governance of energy and climate change.
Elworthy is currently primarily engaged in helping create a “Map of Agriculture”, which will provide information on financial and production yields for different crops and farming systems for different regions around the world. 
Other.
Following his experience at the COP15 Copenhagen climate conference Elworthy established the "Bhuu" charitable environmental organisation. The objective is to develop simple devices which transmit environmental measurements to a central database via the internet. The data can then be visualised and analysed and made available to both the original collectors and the general public. The conception is to empower local communities to be able to measure and interpret relevant environmental information.
Elworthy is Director of the "European Academy" charitable organisation in "Schloss Wartin". Along with his colleague Hans-Joachim Mengel, he has restored the manor house in the Uckermark (German) village of Wartin. The "Collegium Wartinum" Foundation supports the preservation of this manor house and its use as a cultural, artistic, and scientific center in the Uckermark.

Alexander of Acarnania was once a friend of Philip V of Macedon but abandoned him, and insinuated himself so much into the favor of Antiochus III the Great, that he was admitted to his most secret deliberations. He advised the king to invade Greece, holding out him the most brilliant prospects of victory over the Romans. Antiochus followed his advice. Alexander was greatly injured in the Battle of Cynoscephalae (194 BC) in which Antiochus was defeated by the Romans, and in this state he carried the news of the defeat to his kin, who was staying at Thronium, on the Maliac Gulf. When the king, on his retreat from Greece, had reached Cenaeum in Euboea, Alexander died and was buried there, in 191 BC.

The Leica II uses a coupled rangefinder distinct from the viewfinder. The viewfinder is set for a 50mm lens; use of shorter or longer lenses requires installing an alternate viewfinder on the accessory socket.
A mere four copies of the gold-plated Leica Luxus II were made. In 2013, once sold at auction in Hong Kong for $HK4 million, after featuring on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow programme. The whereabouts of the other three models are not recorded.

Olaff the Madlander

Adrian the Barbarian (later Olaff the Madlander) was a comic strip in the comic The Beezer, and later the merged Beezer and Topper, first introduced in 1989. It featured a boy who dressed as a barbarian with a magical sword. He lived in a very strange world where almost anything could happen, whether it be good or bad. Many inanimate objects gained life in the strip, for example a pile of coal for the fire turned into a man called Old King Coal. He appeared in The Beezer annual until the last one dated 2003.
In July 2008, as of issue 3441, Adrian the Barbarian was reprinted in The Beano under the new title of Olaff the Madlander. An explanation was written at the top of the page saying that Olaff and his mum had just moved to the Madlands, but should have been going to the Midlands. This strip was not the first of them, but new speech bubbles indicated that it was (Adrian/Olaff is walking through the door one morning and his mum asks him how he was after the move. This was not in the original, as it is taken from a random issue of the Beezer and Topper - no. 49 to be exact). Olaff the Madlander has only ever appeared in The Beano as reprints, never as new strips.
Olaff the Madlander replaced fellow Beezer and Topper reprint, Fred's Bed. The two strips have never appeared in the same issue together. However, when the Beano received a revamp in issue 3454, (18 October 2008), Fred's Bed returned to the comic, and Olaff has not appeared since. 
The first few strips were drawn by Nigel Parkinson, but his version of the character was disliked by the comic's staff, and so for the most part Sid Burgon was the strip's artist, with occasional strips also being drawn by John Geering. After a year, the character started appearing on the cover of the comic in addition to his appearances on the inside. These cover stories were drawn by Robert Nixon.

Said Rustamov

Said Rustamov (), born Mir-Jabbar Ali oglu Seyid-Rustamzadeh (12 May 1907, Erivan – 10 June 1983, Baku), was an Azerbaijani composer and conductor.
Life and contributions.
Said Rustamov was born in Yerevan where he spent his early years and went to primary school. He was the youngest of the family's four children. After his father's death and his mother's second marriage, he was taken in and brought up by his older brother who had been married by that time. In 1918, as a result of ethnic tensions in Erivan, his brother was murdered. Rustamov's sister-in-law fled with the rest of her family, including himself, to Turkey. In 1919, they moved to Ganja, then Agdash and finally settled in Baku, where young Rustamov got admitted to a teachers seminary. As a teenager, he developed interest in music and visual arts. His musical talent was noticed by one of his teachers, who introduced him to composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. Hajibeyov arranged for the boy's enrolment in a tar class at a music academy. At the same time Rustamov further pursued his career in teaching and graduated from the Azerbaijani State Pedagogical Institute in 1932. Around 1930 he married Bika, a nurse whom he had met while living in Agdash. Together they had four children (two sons and two daughters), all of whom would have been trained in professional music later in their lives.
Rustamov published textbooks on note acquisition and the instruction of tar. His monographs include "Azerbaijani Folk Dances", "Azerbaijani Folk Songs" and "Azerbaijani Ashig Songs". He also wrote children's poems, many of which became part of Azerbaijani school curricula. In 1935, he became the director and conductor of the newly established and unique folk instrument ensemble and remained one for the next 40 years. In 1945, he was appointed director of the Fioletov Club Song and Dance Ensemble and in 1951, of the Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble. In 1948–1953, he was Chairman of the Composers Union of Azerbaijan. In 1951, he received the Stalin Prize, the highest-ranking award in the Soviet Union. In 1957, he became People's Artist of Azerbaijan.
During his career in music, Rustamov composed hundreds of musical pieces, including sheet music for popular operettas and accompaniment for many theatrical plays, as well as suites, marches, cantatas, etc.

Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth

The Community Alliance For the Ethical Treatment of Youth, or CAFETY, is an advocacy group for people enrolled in residential treatment programs for at-risk teenagers. The group's mission includes advocating for access to advocates, due process, alternatives to aversive behavioral interventions, and alternatives to restraints and seclusion for young people in treatment programs. They have also called for the routine reporting of abuse in residential treatment programs, as well as federal government oversight and regulation of residential treatment programs.
Structure.
CAFETY is registered as a nonprofit corporation in New York. It is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors and also maintains an Advisory Board.
CAFETY's current Executive Director is Kathryn Whitehead. As one of its key spokespeople, she has been featured in "Mother Jones", "Time Magazine" and "The NewStandard". Whitehead's and CAFETY's work on the issues of trauma and human rights abuses of youth in residential care, respectively, has also been published in the American Psychological Association's "Journal of Orthopsychiatry".
History.
CAFETY was founded in 2006 by Charles King and Kathryn Whitehead, with the goal: ""to create a forum for youth advocacy and support designed to develop and shape youth-guided policies and practices with a speciﬁc emphasis on the ethical treatment of youth with behavioral, emotional, and mental health problems in institutional settings"". By July of that year, CAFETY had 118 members and 8 core group members from across the United States, including at least one medical professional.
Campaigns.
CAFETYs' 'Care, NOT Coercion' Campaign seeks to end institutionalized child abuse and human rights violations in institutional settings. The organization additionally advocates for the regulation of, and the efficacy in treatment in such settings. In pursuit of that objective, CAFETY has chiefly focused its efforts on actively mobilizing its members in public education efforts and supporting and providing testimony in support of legislation aimed at the regulation of residential treatment facilities in the United States.
Public activism and outreach.
From late 2007 through 2008, a broad coalition of grass roots efforts, prominent medical and psychological organizations that included members of CAFETY, provided testimony and support that led to the creation of the "Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008" by the United States Congress Committee on Education and Labor.
In support of this effort, Jon Martin-Crawford, a member of the group's Board of Directors and Kathryn Whitehead, the group's Executive Director, appeared at a hearing before the United States Congress Committee on Education and Labor on April 24, 2008., where they described abusive practices they had experienced at the Family Foundation School and Mission Mountain School, both therapeutic boarding schools.
On February 19, 2009, CAFETY co-sponsored a press briefing on Capitol Hill in an effort to raise awareness of youth maltreatment in residential care.
In October, 2009, the CAFETY sent an unsolicited mass-mailing to 4,000 residents of Delaware County, using a mailing list compiled by "going through the white pages of Delaware County phone books" alerting the residents of abuse allegations at a local Therapeutic Boarding School called The Family Foundation School. The two page mailing included a page of excerpts from alumni testimony alleging abuse.
The allegations in the letter were dismissed by Jeff Brain, the Family Foundation School's vice president for external relations and acting director of admissions by telling a newspaper that "all the allegations are categorically untrue or grossly exaggerated...and determined to be unfounded."
CAFETY and its members also held a teens' rights rally held in Gainsville, Florida. At the rally, Chris Noroski, vice president of CAFETY, stated that while he was at The Family Foundation School in Hancock, NY, he was mentally and physically abused, stating
"For seven months of the time, I carried buckets of rocks back and forth"
On April 5, 2011 CAFETY was quoted in an article for Time.com called "Increasingly, Internet Activism Helps Shutter Abusive 'Troubled Teen' Boot Camps."
CAFETY, along with the American Psychological Association, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Therapy, and the American Bar Association was a major supporter of the bill H.R 911, "Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act," which was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2009 and passed in the House of Representatives, but was not acted upon in the Senate and did not become law.

Chelsea Clock Company

The Chelsea Clock Company, founded in 1897, is one of the oldest, largest, and few remaining American clock manufacturing companies in existence. For over a century, Chelsea's clockmakers have been designing and handcrafting distinguished, high quality clocks for customers in the corporate, consumer, government and marine markets. Today, the company continues to build and repair clocks at its original corporate headquarters in Chelsea, Massachusetts.
Long regarded as one of America's highest quality products, Chelsea Clocks are found in the White House on US Naval Ships [http://www.chelseaclockmuseum.com/newpage9.htm, and in homes and offices around the world.
History.
The story of Chelsea Clock spans more than a century and is closely entwined with the history of clock making in America. Its early years, however, like those of the nation itself, were sometimes ones of turbulence, survival, and unflagging devotion by the owners, craftsmen, and shop workers who have helped it endure.
As in many trades, early American clock makers learned their craft as apprentices to master craftsmen. Some later established companies in their own names. Like many entrepreneurs, however, their grasp of business skills was often weak and so their fledgling enterprises frequently failed.
The early years.
One of America's earliest and most successful clock makers was Simon Willard, renowned for his banjo and other fine clocks with movements of cast brass and exquisite mahogany cabinetry. In 1842, Edward Howard, who apprenticed under Willard's nephew Andrew, founded the E. Howard Clock Company. In turn, Howard taught a promising and inventive apprentice named Joseph Eastman [http://www.chelseaclockmuseum.com/jhe1.htm], who later founded the Eastman Clock Company. At one point, Eastman adapted the movement from a large Waltham watch to a small clock, thereby enabling it to operate—unlike a pendulum clock—in any position. Eastman's entrepreneurial efforts, however, ended in bankruptcy shortly after building a new factory just north of Boston in Chelsea, Massachusetts.
For a brief time thereafter, a small group of businessmen operated the facility as the Boston Clock Company of Maine. On July 23, 1897, Charles Pearson, a native Bostonian, acquired the property and, within days, began operating it as the Chelsea Clock Company. The site has been home to the company ever since.
Chelsea's board of directors elected Whipple Potter the company's first president and Pearson, a man of considerably less management experience, its treasurer. In buying the company, Pearson saw strong market potential for premium quality timepieces and was soon captivated by the idea of producing the world's finest clock.
When buying the property, Pearson also acquired its tools and machinery—much of the latter jury-rigged and badly worn. He immediately set about expanding Chelsea's workforce and investing in major plant and equipment improvements. Early production centered on pendulum models and brass plated, non-striking marine clocks. Pendulum clocks, with their fine mahogany cabinets, often took months to produce. The company produced its marine clocks entirely in-house, so these created revenue far more quickly.
Under Pearson's guidance, Chelsea made numerous product design improvements, many of which it patented. These included the design for a ship's bell clock having a fully encased chime and striking mechanism, patented in 1900. By 1903, the company also produced clocks for automobiles, soon counting Rolls Royce, Packard, and Studebaker among its customers. It wasn't until 1906, however, that the company earned its first profit. The United States Navy was by then ordering Chelsea's marine clocks in increasing quantities, leading other military branches to follow their lead. In 1907 and 1908, the U.S. Treasury Department ordered more than 100 clocks for its offices throughout the country. This motivated Pearson to establish the Boston Clock Company, essentially a separate brand for clocks and related instruments—including an artillery time fuse—the company manufactured to meet government standards.
From 1906 until the late 1920s, Chelsea's business grew profitably under Pearson's guidance. In 1928, however, he died following a brief illness. He wanted William Neagle, who he had hired 26 years earlier, to have first option on buying the company, which Neagle soon did.
The mid 1900s.
Neagle was quick to replace less popular models with new ones, including the Forecaster, Fulton, and Georgian. Shortly after he assumed ownership, however, the stock market crashed and the Great Depression set in. Through drastic inventory and cost reductions Neagle managed to keep Chelsea afloat. When World War II arrived, Chelsea's role as a government supplier helped offset declining consumer sales. Neagle retired in 1945, selling the company to longtime employees George King and Walter Mutz.
In postwar 1946, the United States Air Force created its Strategic Air Command (SAC) and equipped each if its bombers and nuclear missile silos with Chelsea clocks. Meanwhile, Mutz noted a growing demand for electric clocks and, in 1947, introduced Chelsea's Model VE. He also introduced consumer versions of its popular military clocks, the Type "A" (12 hour) and Type "B" (24 hour). Mutz and King eventually discontinued several models, including the Athena, Fulton, and Magellan, while adding others, among them Bookends, Comet, and Corvette. James Leone, Chelsea's director of engineering, also introduced several improvements to the company's Ship's Bell model, including the addition of a stop strike lever. The redesigned movement, called the Model 4L, remains largely the same to this day.
The late 1900s.
In 1970, Mutz and King sold Chelsea Clock to Automation Industries, where Chelsea became part of the marine division. Soon thereafter, Chelsea's management noted the growing popularity of less expensive European movements, leading it to introduce a line of mid-priced clocks with German-made Hermle movements. To distinguish them from its premium clocks, Chelsea introduced its Boston Ship's Strike brand. In 1972, just two years after acquiring Chelsea Clock, Automation sold it to Bunker Ramo Corporation who, among many things, was the nation's largest producer of automotive clocks. In 1975, Chelsea began marketing its Ship's Bell and house strike (12-hour chime) movements with pendulum escapements in the popular banjo style. That same year, it also designed and introduced its first tide clock.
Bunker Ramo sold Chelsea in 1978 to Richard Leavitt, a native Bostonian, avid sailor, and former corporate auditor. Leavitt soon realized Chelsea could no longer rely largely on its government, marine, and Ship's Bell sales, so he revitalized its jewelry house line, introducing ten new clock models in 1981. He also resumed efforts to reserve the Chelsea brand name for the company's premium timepieces, and use the Boston brand for mid-line products—a practice he abandoned ten years later. By 1984, quartz and digital timekeeping technology were well established, leading Chelsea to introduce its Chronoquartz clock, named for its chronometer-like accuracy.
A new century.
In 2005, after leading Chelsea Clock for more than 25 years, Leavitt, sold the company to JK Nicholas, an investor in Boston Scientific a business consultant, entrepreneur, and longtime collector of Chelsea clocks. Today, the company continues to produce its famed Ship's Bell clocks, Limited editions like the recently introduced: American Eagle series by designer/sculptor Vincent Harrild, and a variety of other models—all crafted, hand assembled, and serviced at the same factory where the company was founded more than a century ago.
Throughout its stormy history, the company's unflagging commitment to high quality has enabled it to endure and, in the process, brought much notoriety. Many U.S. presidents and government dignitaries have owned, given, and received Chelsea clocks. They ride aboard many of world's finest yachts to ports large and small throughout the world. Early Chelsea clocks have become cherished antiques, highly valued by museums and private collectors alike. Chelsea Clock's continuing uncompromising attention to quality has resulted in the company's more recent reputation as "The Last Great American Clock Company."1

Alexander Tarasov

Alexander Nikolaevich Tarasov (, born March 8, 1958 in Moscow) is a Soviet and Russian left-wing sociologist, politologist, culturologist, publicist, writer and philosopher. Up until the beginning of the 21st century he referred to himself as a Post-Marxist alongside István Mészáros and a number of Yugoslav Marxist philosophers who belonged to Praxis School and emigrated to London. Since in the 21st century the term Post-Marxism has been appropriated by Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe and their followers, Alexander Tarasov (together with the above mentioned István Mészáros and Yugoslav philosophers) stopped referring to himself as a Post-Marxist.
Early political activity and arrest.
In December 1972 - January 1973 together with Vasily Minorsky, Tarasov has founded an underground radical left group called the "Party of New Communists" (PNC) (Russian: Партия новых коммунистов (ПНК)), and became the group's informal leader in the summer of 1973. In 1974 PNC merged with another underground radical left group called “Left School” (Russian: Левая школа) to form the “Neo-Communist Party of the Soviet Union” (NCPSU) (Russian: Неокоммунистическая партия Советского Союза (НКПСС)). Tarasov has become one of the NCPSU leaders and theorists, writing the party program, The Principles of Neo-communism (Russian: Принципы неокоммунизма) in 1974. The KGB arrested him in 1975. Upon preliminary imprisonment and a yearlong confinement in a special psychiatric hospital he was released because the NCPSU case was never brought to trial. In the psychiatric hospital Tarasov was subjected to cruel treatment and (de facto) to torture (beatings, ETC - electroconvulsive therapy, induced hypoglycemia, injection of large doses of neuroleptics) all resulting in severe somatic disorders which A.Tarasov has been suffering from since his release, leaving him virtually disabled (Hypertonia, Ankylosing Spondylitis, liver and pancreas diseases). After his release, Tarasov participated in restoration of NCPSU, which he had led until its self-dissolution in January 1985. In 1988, two State Psychiatric Commissions examined Tarasov and found him completely psychologically healthy. ("Also read": Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union)
Education and career.
Tarasov held many different jobs: he worked as a draughtsman; laboratory assistant in a design institute; graveyard warden at Vagankovo Cemetery (Moscow); machinist; boiler technician; librarian; editor; feldsher; gas boiler operator; bookkeeper at the Central Warehouse of Mikoyan Meat Processing Plant Corp.; light board operator at Moscow Hermitage Theatre (located in Moscow Hermitage Garden); research associate at the Centre for Scientific Analysis (Russian Academy of Sciences); university teacher; consultant for the Ministry of Education and Science (Russia); political columnist; expert at Information Research Centre “Panorama” and Moscow Human Rights Committee; etc. He got a degree in Economics from All-Russian State Distance Learning Institute of Finance and Economics and a degree in History (started at the Moscow State Pedagogical University and finished at Lomonosov Moscow State University). When “perestroika” started, he soon firmly positioned himself as a professional sociologist and politologist.
Publishing and literary activity.
In 1984, Tarasov started publishing his works (under a pseudonym) in the USSR (“samizdat”) and in foreign press. In 1988, his articles started appearing (under pseudonyms) in independent press and from 1990 he has been publishing his works in independent and official press under his own name.
In 1988 he founded the “Independent Archive” (from 1990: “Independent Archive — Independent Sociological Service”) and in 1991 he became an associate at the Centre for New Sociology and the Study of Applied Politics “Phoenix” (Russian: Центр новой социологии и изучения практической политики "Феникс"). In 2004, he became a co-director of "Phoenix" and, in February 2009, its director.
In the first half of 1993 Tarasov was one of the three editors of a monthly magazine called “The House of the Unions”, published by the same team as “Solidarnost” (Russian: Солидарность (Solidarity), the newspaper founded by the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions (MFP) (currently the newspaper of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia). The magazine had a circulation of 30,000. In his address to the readers of the first issue A.Tarasov noted that "The House of the Unions" makes it its mission to “update Socialist thought” and “create a theory that matches current reality.” After just five issues the magazine was closed down by Andrei Isaev, Editor in Chief of “Solidarnost”, for non-conforming to the political line of MFP, i.e. for “excessive” radicalism.
Tarasov has penned 1030 publications in sociology (mainly on youth studies
, education issues and conflict resolution); politology
(current politics, political radicalism in Russia and abroad, mass social movements); history (history and theory of revolutionary movement and guerrilla warfare); culturology
(popular culture issues, intercultural and inter-civilization contradictions); economics(comparative research). He is also a literary and movie critic (modern literature and cinema, popular culture and politics, history and theory of the cinematography of the 1960s and 1970s). He has been the first to study and describe Nazi-skinhead subculture in Russia. A.Tarasov is the author of the first profound research on the influence of far-right ideas and organizations on the subculture of football fans in Russia (November 2009 – January 2010).
In 2002 he was one of the founders, compilers and a scientific editor of a book series "Zero Hour: Contemporary World Anti-Bourgeois Thought" (Russian: ""Час "Ч". Современная мировая антибуржуазная мысль"" – “Gilea” Publishing House). He followed this with two additional book series: Class Struggle (German: Klassenkampf; co-edited with Boris Yuliyevich Kagarlitsky – “Ultra.Culture” Publishing House) in 2005, and The Rose of the Revolution (Russian: роЗА РЕВОлюций) in 2006 (“Cultural Revolution” Publishing House). These series include modern left-wing socio-political literature (mainly foreign).
Political extremists.
On November 4, 1995, Tarasov was the victim of an unprovoked assault near his house: after calling him by name, unknown attackers beat him so severely that he lost consciousness (although he tried to defend himself). The attackers escaped with his passport (likely to be used for reporting), but did not touch a large amount of money, a dictation machine and a bottle of Italian Vermouth “Cinzano”. Police opened a criminal investigation into the assault, but the attackers have never been found.
In 2008, neo-Nazis included A. Tarasov on the list of their enemies who must be physically exterminated. The list was published on radical right-wing sites. In 2011, Russian pro-Kremlin group “Nashi” named Tarasov among “168 most loathsome enemies” of this group, of Vasily Yakemenko (group’s leader) and of Vladimir Putin’s regime.
Tarasov is known among Russian anarchists as their consistent critic, first – of the practice of anarchism (as fruitless and unpromising), and partially of the theory (as outdated and unscientific). Tarasov’s criticism has caused open animosity towards him among anarchists.
Tarasov’s reaction to 2011–2012 Russian protests was negative. He criticized the protests from the left, considering them to be the movement of petit bourgeoisie and "consumers' rebellion” alien to the goals and objectives of left-wing forces in Russia and irrelevant to the revolutionary struggle against capitalism.
Recognition and awards.
Tarasov is an accomplished prose and poetry writer (since 1992). He is also a translator from English and Spanish (since 1997). Tarasov’s works have been published, apart from Russia, in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Hungary, India, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, Panama, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Transnistria, Cuba and Ukraine. He is a laureate of the prizes of several literary magazines: “Druzhba Narodov” ("Friendship of Peoples", Russian: "«Дружба Народов»" (2000), “Yunost” ("Youth", Russian: "«Юность»" (2001) and “Oktyabr'” ("October", Russian: "«Октябрь»" (2011).

Saro Vera

Monsignor Saro Wilfrido Vera Troche was a religious man of Paraguay 
Born on October 6, 1922 in the company of Rosario Tatuy Caazapá Department Paraguay, in a peasant family of profound popular religiosity. 
He died in 2000, and because of his career, it was understood that this was a man who has left his intellectual legacy.
Childhood and youth.
Its primary studies were done in Caazapá and interrupted by two years because of the Chaco War in the year 1935. 
He did his first year of classic high school in the Metropolitan Seminary of Asuncion. At a very early age, at the age of thirteen, he joined the Metropolitan Seminary in Buenos Aires, where he studied philosophy and theology. In this institution he succeeded in his bachelor's degree. 
He was ordained a priest in the same seminar, November 28, 1948. He returned to Paraguay in 1950 and ended a year of preparation for a bachelor's degree in theology.
First Steps.
Since assuming his role in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, he decided not to be a priest in the town of Villarrica, but to work among the poor of the parish of Buena Vista, where he was for many years. 
The archbishop of Asuncion, Felipe Santiago Benitez, who prefaces the book "The evangelization of the Paraguayan", defines him as a thinker of theParaguayan church, "In my view, the higher quality of our times," he says. He adds that "many of his claims could be discussed or, perhaps, not acceptable, but deserve our respect and admiration."
Works.
Saro Vera has written a lot but not everything writing has been published. 
In his book "The evangelization of the Paraguayan", Saro Vera proposed a scientific study of the Paraguayan Catholic in his Christian life. 
Another of his books is "Six stories of a peasant", which prologue was written by Helio Vera, who defines this collection of stories as a mixture of fiction and reality that does not lose its testimonial character, as they are developed in the events by the guerrillas of the sixties, which operated in the area where Saro Vera fulfilled his evangelical mission. 
The prologue writers explain that perhaps is a way to print a reflection and an education: "We drew the tortuous paths that our people had to go, pushed by the unstoppable dialectic of violence," says Vera. 
Other titles published by Saro Vera is "Stories of Paraguay locals" 
But in his book: "The Paraguayan, a man outside his world", where he clearly defines the three famous laws: the mbareté (the tough), ñembotavy (the indifferent) and vaivai (so-so), which are not stories but ways of thinking and acting of Paraguayans. 
Saro Vera understood that "to know the national being we need to discover the hidden reasons or deep motivations, immersed in the distance of time, in the subconscious and into unconsciousness." 
This material is of great significance for understanding how Paraguayans are. Here is part of his work.
"Kuimba`e Nahaséiva "(Men do not cry).
In Paraguay, a man should not cry since childhood. Not crying is a sign of something much broader than a mere machismo. 
This attitude is related to his role. Refrain from showing their feelings, especially adverse ones; he finds it compelling to dominate pain and misfortune. The Paraguayan, even though his role is conducted outside the home, is the facilitator who holds the nurturing and protection. The man does not require feelings. First of all you need strength, skill "ha'evé" ability and ingenuity, a tendency to work. 
The anemic man will not be the breadwinner of the family or anyone. What can be expected from a complaining man, who regrets a scratch? The man must master his feelings in general and especially his feelings of pain and setbacks. 
This man, owner of himself and pain, is not obtained if he is not educated and formed. Hence from childhood that man should not cry. When he cries, you hit him so he can shut up and learn to master his pain and his tears. With this procedure he does not seek a machismo, but a training for a respectable compliance of his role as man. We must strengthen the boy against pain. 
Neither the girl should unleash her expressions of grief. She also requires the self-control to survive in a world of frugality, deprivation and poorly cured diseases. We must her prepare to deal with this.
Paraguay and the common wealth.
This corresponds to another fragment analysis in the book "The Paraguayan, a man outside his world" of Saro Vera: 
The Paraguayan, with his kind of culture, is not inserted in the macro community. The nation exceeds their psychic ability of integration. His psychological place is in the mini community of the family. The common good of the family is the only thing he finds understandable, or to all interests to which all members are entitled according to a scale of privileged positions in relation to kinship. 
Common wealth is the responsibility of the authority. The Paraguayan considers silly the one who is in the Government and has not taken the opportunity to enrich himself. The conviction of dishonesty in dealing with the public response would be purely intellectual, existential without any force. 
For the people, what we call dishonesty is taken for granted. What you should do is to ease its public intemperance with works showing that the national treasury is not going entirely to your pocket. "To'úna pero toyapó", to use but to do something. Putting this condition, everything is going to go well. Another condition that clogs the evil of exploiting the common wealth is resorting to the excuse of involving others. "To'una, anínte ho'upaitereí ha'eño; to porokonvidamimi", he who exploits common wealth should involve others in doing so, too.
"The Paraguayan and freedom".
This analysis is part of the study "The Paraguayan, a man outside his world" of Saro Vera: 
The Paraguayan still maintains the concept of freedom of a tribal society. He is happy to be free internally. 
Any citizen can question the freedom of the Paraguayan. He, in turn, questions the freedom of the citizen who manipulated by appearances, lies, false promises and the media, deposited the vote by which apparently is given to the winner.
Where the Paraguayan feels really free is in the use of time. Being the owner of time is the great freedom. If he happens to work, he works and if not, he does not work. The days, hours and weeks are his, without Damocles’ sword hanging over his head. He should not apologize because he was late by kneeling nearly five minutes.
The Paraguayan and power.
This religious man also referred to power in "The Paraguayan, a man outside his world": 
Power is a serious temptation for the Paraguayan. Perhaps it is so for most of the world, but not for some few. Through power man occupies a privileged place within society. It is a very remarkable change the one power produces in Paraguayans. He immediately assumes an attitude of life-forgiver and guardian. 
He is sensitive to what he is considered the protector of. He would break his own soul not to disappoint the protected ones, because the protected ones will always be inferior to him. He will always require places of prominence; special considerations and honors. 
He must be at the head of any enterprise or organization, but do absolutely nothing. No one should count on him if he is relegated to a lower position or if someone has him as subordinate. In this case he will do the impossible by boycotting the work to demonstrate that he is vital at head of the enterprise. Let's not talk of a chief supporter. This will assume all the possible roles of a community. He will be mayor, judge and if allowed, would also be the parish priest. The problem with the Paraguayan power is the misplacement. He is a chieftain in a civilized state. Paraguay is the country of friends. The ordinary people need this support because no rights protect them. 
He is bound to obligations and also exposed to the whim of man in power.
The Paraguayan and wealth.
Another element that the Paraguayan is totally scrambled with is wealth. Anyone who reaches a certain economic level suffers a change, such that it is difficult to recognize the person after a while. It's amazing the change that comes at them with wealth in their hands. The "riko pyahu." (new rich) is an unrecognizable Paraguayan.
The Paraguayan and work.
Is the Paraguayan lazy or not? In this case there are irrational detractors who haven’t thought or want to know anything about defending the Paraguayan. 
The Paraguayan does not work as he should. He loses hours drinking terere. He never strives to the maximum. When a loan is granted, the money is invested on superfluous things and not on improving his farming area. 
The Paraguayan is a highly valued worker in any field outside Paraguay, because even being semi literate, they become highly skilled workers. 
The ideal for the Paraguayan is to earn money without working or working with the least effort. So every time that he can carry out paid work it will be "vaivaí suerte raicha" (in a bad way, for luck)
However, when working for a friend and without payment, he does so thoroughly, not "vaivaí."(in a bad way)
Paraguayan and love.
The best recommendation for a husband is to be a worker, because he gets to sustain the family. His pride is that their children are well looked after and an elegant wife. He is praised because of his "hembireko poti" (lit. clean wife)
In this cultural context love is almost functional. There is almost no place for romance and affection. These connotations of love are almost reduced to times of courtship. On the other hand, the Paraguayan man is extremely sensitive to affection. But the roles often deviate and consume time that would be devoted to the emotional expressions. 
Besides, too much demonstration overwhelms both male and female Paraguayans. 
When the woman is too sticky, the man is annoyed. He can stand up to a certain extent, and passing that measure, he feels upset. He is neither very supportive to demonstrations of love in public. Love belongs to the world of privacy. The Paraguayans are little demonstrative of their feelings of grief or joy, love or hatred, almost always reduced to very measured gestures and actions. They spare no words. 
The Paraguayan is noble. A feature of nobility is his inability to take revenge.

Zidane y va marquer

"Zidane y va marquer" is a song recorded by the French TV and radio host Sébastien Cauet and broadcast on radio from May 2006. Based on the music of Salif Keita and Martin Solveig's hit single "Madân", this parody refers to Zinedine Zidane and other players of the French football team competing in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Background and writing.
From May 2006, the song featured on the radio program hosted by Cauet every morning. The tone is humorous and refers to Zidane as a providential savior. The lyrics also mentioned the non-selection of Jérôme Rothen and Nicolas Anelka and the unexpected selection of Pascal Chimbonda. In the original version, Zidane was injured leaving the place to Claude Makélélé, but after the match France - China, the lyrics were changed to reflect Djibril Cissé's real life injury.
The song gained in popularity with the victories of the France national football team at the World Cup, being sung in the streets during the after games celebrations. Thereafter, Cauet decided to record the song as a single, which was published by Universal Music. The refrain featured in advertising jingles on TF1 before matches. The lyrics were changed in order to allow the release of the song (for example, the line mentioning Sony's PlayStation Portable was deleted).
The music video was shot only a few days before the final match of the World Cup: devoted to karaoke, it shows Cauet's entire team of hosts singing the song in the streets. Even though France didn't win, Zidane, after having rammed his head into Marco Materazzi's chest and his expulsion, revived the song. Therefore, "Zidane y va marquer" became a hit in France.
Cover versions.
The same day, the group La Plage immediately covered the song re-entitled "Coup de Boule" and dealing with the aggression of Zidane. Composed in a few hours and quickly leaked on the Internet, it also became a hit and reached number 1 on the French and Belgian Singles Charts.
In 2007, Les Enfoirés recorded a medley of summer hits, including "Zidane y va marquer", performed by Jean-Baptiste Maunier and Pierre Palmade and available on the 2007 album "La Caravane des Enfoirés".
At the Rugby World Cup of 2007, Cauet adapted and sang the song re-entitled "Chabal va les manger" by modifying the lyrics.

Tierra Redonda Mountain

Tierra Redonda Mountain is a mountain in northwestern San Luis Obispo County, California. It is in the eastern portion of the Santa Lucia Range, separated from the main ridge by the Nacimiento River.
Location.
The mountain is north of Lake Nacimiento, with the summit being about a mile and a half (two kilometers) from the shoreline near the northwestern extremity of the lake. It is about 18 miles (30 km) from the Pacific Ocean at San Simeon. The elevation of the summit is 2051 feet (625 m). The primary maintained public road to the mountain is Interlake Road, San Luis Obispo County G14 (also signed in nearby Monterey County as G14), which passes about 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) northeast of the summit. This road intersects U.S. Highway 101 at Paso Robles, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) to the southeast. Oak Shores Drive winds around the western portion of the mountain from a junction with G14 to the shore of Lake Nacimiento, and Tierra Redonda Road comes around from the east.
The mountain is part of a small island of Bureau of Land Management land, , entirely surrounded by private land. BLM has designated it as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), along with several other BLM holdings in the area (such as the Carrizo Plain and Cypress Mountain) due to the high concentration of unique, sensitive, and threatened species found in the vicinity, as well as for its singularly rich paleontological resources. This designation is in part because of encroaching development from the south, where private residences are being built on the shore of Lake Nacimiento, within the Oak Shores community. The region has also designated the region as open space in their General Plan.
Natural setting.
Primary plant communities represented around the mountain include chaparral and blue oak woodlands, although grasslands and unusual sand dune formations also occur. Within the ACEC there are several sensitive plant species, some endemic to the area. These include several species of "Chorizanthe", among the most concentrated known anywhere, along with ribbonwood, Salinas Valley goldfields, San Luis Obispo County lupine, and the one-awned spineflower.
While petroleum exploration is not presently occurring in the vicinity, the potential for oil and gas is considered by the BLM to be moderate. The Vaqueros Formation, which outcrops significantly on the mountain, accounting for its famous fossil beds, is an oil-bearing unit at the South Cuyama and Russell Ranch Oil Fields to the southwest, and the large, prolific San Ardo Oil Field, one of the most active in California, is only ten miles to the northwest, along U.S. 101.

House of Bajamonti

The Bajamonti family are considered one of the most prestigious families of the city of Split in Croatia. The family originated in Bergamo, Lombardy.
The Bajamonti family has been mentioned for the first time in Split Registry Books at the beginning of the 18th century (1704) as owners of a very rich library collection. The first data about the library had been recorded by Julije Bajamonti (Giulio Bajamonti) (1744–1800), registering that the big fire of 1787 had seriously damaged the collection. Until recently, the public has only been acquainted with a few titles preserved by the Split Archeological Museum Library.
Recent research of the Rara Collection in the University Library of Split resulted in the discovery of thirty-two titles collected in fifty-one volumes and in fact bearing the exlibris signatures of Gian Domenico and Girolamo Bajamonti or in some cases signed just Bajamonti. The titles cover the topics ranging from grammar, philosophy, classical and Italian literature, theology, natural sciences, as well as a vast collection of legal books - primarily focusing on the Church and Civil Law. There are also numerous works by German and Italian authors from the field of natural law. The originals had been written in Italian and Latin, although the collection also includes translations from French and Latin into Italian. The books had been printed in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and France, and are dating from the 16th century (two titles), the 17th century (two titles), the 18th century (25 titles), and only one dating from the first half of the 19th century. Seven works from the Bajamonti collection had been a gift from the Split ecclesiaste Mate Bogetić, while five titles from the family collection had been passed down to the Gabinetto di lettura collection, to be returned later along with the other titles to the University Library of Split.
The most famous Bajamonti was Antonio Bajamonti ("Split, 19 February 1822 - Split, 13 January 1891"), who became mayor of Split in 1860 for the Autonomist Party (pro-Italian) and - except for a brief interruption during the period 1864-65 - held the post for over two decades until 1880. Bajamonti was also a member of the Parliament of Dalmatia (1861–91) and the Austrian Chamber of Deputies (1867–70 and 1873–79). He married Lujza Krušević.

Josiah Forster

Josiah Forster (1782 – 27 June 1870) was a teacher and philanthropist. He was an early member of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1839 and a supporter of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Both he and his wife were senior figures in the British Quakers.
Biography.
Forster was born in 1782. He became a teacher at the school his grandfather, also Josiah Forster (1693-1763), had founded in Tottenham. The school started in 1752 in the ballroom of their grandfather's house and was called Forster's School. His first wife, Rachel (née Wilson) was over thirty years older than he was, and died in 1801.
Forster started another school in 1805 in Southgate that eventually moved to Tottenham in 1820. He ran this school until 1826 when he decided to devote more time to his Quaker interests. His wife had already been made a minister in 1810, and shortly afterward he began sitting on Quaker committees; in 1817 he become an elder of the church. He campaigned for anti-slavery and worked for the British and Foreign Bible Society. He held the senior position of clerk to the Annual meeting of British Quakers from 1820 to 1831.
In 1838, Forster accompanied Elizabeth Fry on her tour and inspection of prisons in France.
Forster sat on a committee of Quaker elders in 1836-7 who unsuccessfully tried to heal a schism in the Quaker church caused by the "Beaconite Controversy". The controversy was named after a book published in January 1835 called "" which was written by Isaac Crewdson, a leader to the Manchester Quaker meeting. The controversy, which related to evangelism in the society, eventually led to the resignation of Crewdson and about 300 similarly minded people across the country.
The "Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade" was mainly a Quaker society founded in the eighteenth century by Thomas Clarkson. Slavery had in theory been made illegal in 1807 in the British Empire. Following the Reform Act, William Wilberforce was able to get legislation through parliament. In 1838 legislation freed the slaves who had been relabelled apprentices. As a result in August 1838 800,000 people in the British empire became free.
A picture was commissioned that showed the delegates, including Josiah Forster, of the new British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society which was formed in 1839. The painting captured this important international convention in June, 1840. The small extract shown here includes only Samuel Gurney a banker and fellow Quaker, Forster, and William Allen. Also in this painting are Josiah's brothers, Robert and William Forster, many significant figures and Isaac Crewdson. This new society's aim was "The universal extinction of slavery and the slave trade and the protection of the rights and interests of the enfranchised population in the British possessions and of all persons captured as slaves."
In 1842-3 a schism developed in the Society of Friends in Salem in Iowa. The difference developed over the ways that the society should support slavery, which was still an important part of the American economy. A rival meeting house had been created, and a separate burial ground which was separated from the older Quaker burial ground by a mere two feet of space. Four delegates were sent from Britain: Forster, his brother William, George Stacey and John Allen. The group did not manage to heal the divide immediately but it was resolved by 1848.
In 1849 the yearly meeting of the Quakers requested that representatives be sent to the rulers of the Christian nations. Forster accompanied his brother, William, in 1853 when they and two others visited the American president, Franklin Pierce, and journeyed to spread the news around the governors of the southern American states. It was during this journey that William died and was buried in the Quaker town of Friendsville in Tennessee which was on the Underground Railroad.
Josiah Forster and his wife, Sarah, established a trust in 1862, where four new cottages were to be given to poor widows aged 55 or over. The managing committee was to be four Quakers including his nephew, W.E. Forster M.P.
He attended the annual meeting of the British Quakers until his death in 1870.
Bible societies.
Forster was a long and valued supporter of the evangelical work of publishing and distributing Bibles. In 1862 he chaired a meeting at Bible House, Blackfriars, where it was agreed that £2000 be sent to the American Bible Society, the US sister society of the "British and Foreign Bible Society".
Education.
Besides working at his grandfather's school, Forster helped to found the Grove House School in 1828 and he served on the management committee of the Lancasterian Boys' School in Tottenham. Forster and his brother Robert were lifelong members of the London committee for Ackworth School.
Memorials.
Two almshouses in Tottenham are named after him. They provide four one-bedroomed sheltered homes for the elderly.

Lophosoria quadripinnata

Lophosoria quadripinnata (J.F.Gmel.) C.Chr. is a species of fern that, according to DNA molecular analysis, belongs to the Dicksoniacea family, where it is placed in its own monotypic genus Lophosoria. It is found in the Americas spanning from Cuba and Mexico to Chile. In Chile it is present in the area between Talca and Aysén including Juan Fernández Islands. In Argentina it grows only in the humid valleys of western Neuquén and Río Negro Province. In Spanish it is known as 'ampe' (from the Mapudungun añpe) or palmilla, but one has to remember that there are several species of ferns called "palmillas" that have larger or smaller fronds, and which grow in colder climates. It is a medium-sized plant, growing to about 4–5 feet and even though the rhizome does not grow a trunk, it is clearly related to the other tree ferns due to features that were apparently already present in their common ancestor, like 'pneumathodes', and the rhizome which changed from the dorsiventral symmetry typical of the other ferns, to a radial symmetry typical of tree ferns. Their large and multiple pinnate fronds, with the petiole raised adaxially, and the hairs on the rhizome and lower part of the petioles, also resemble those of tree ferns. To identify the species, use the position and characteristics of the spores found on the fertile fronds. The genus already existed in the Cretaceous Period in southern Gondwana according to fossil remains found in Antarctica. The species is well known as an ornamental plant.
Description.
"Lophosoria quadripinnata" is a vascular plant with two alternating generations, a sporophyte and a gametophyte, multicellular and independent; with spores as a means of dispersion and survival. The gametophyte is a "thallus" (undifferentiated tissue), and the sporophyte is a "corm" (with roots, shoots, and a vascular system). Due to these characteristics it is usually classified as a "pteridophyte". They have sporophytes with megaphylls or "fronds" (Euphyllophytina). 
The rhizome is massive, with hairs, not growing a trunk (not arborescent), and with radial symmetry instead of horizontal; a characteristic apparently originating in the ancestor of the tree ferns. The fronds are large in size, 2-3 pinnations, with hairs on the under side of the petioles, and they are high on its abaxial part, all common characteristics of the Cyatheales order (the tree ferns clade). Also present are the pneumathodes (discrete vent lines, or patches, present on the rachis, petiole and rhizome, whose function is facilitating gas exchange in the dense tissue), which are characteristic of the tree fern clade.
The sori, without indusia (covering), are located on the abaxial (lower) surface, on the veins of the last pinnae. The leaf margin does not form part of an indusium, as in other Dicksoniaceae. The sori have numerous hairs (called "filiform paraphyses") between the sporangia. The characteristics and position of the sori are unique and can be used to identify the species.
Like all Polypodiopsidas, the sporangia are leptosporangiate (with a foot, capsule with a single-cell wall thickness, and dehiscent ring in the capsule). As in all the tree ferns, the ring is oblique and complete, not interrupted by the foot of the sporangium. The spores have trilete marks. This species has spores with a very unusual morphology, with an central belt ("cincture") that meant for a long time the species was assigned its own family, Lophosoriaceae.
The germination of the gametophyte corresponds to the "Cyathea" genus, giving rise to short strands of from two to six cells in both varieties. The prothallus development is of the "Adiantum" type. When raised in the laboratory, gametophytes of the quadripinnata variety are always chordates, however gametophytes of the "contracta" variety possess three morphs, depending on the density of spores that are developed (Dyer 1979). At low density, they are long spatulates with a central meristem and a slightly more developed wing than the other; at medium densities they are cordiforms and at high densities are band-like with a large amount of antheridia.
The gametophyte is protandric (a hermaphrodite, first antheridia are developed that give antherozoids, and then the archegonia that gives the oospheres). The number of x chromosomes = 65.
Taxonomy.
Genetic analysis has placed the species unequivocally in the Dicksoniaceae family, but the story of its taxonomic placement is long. Pichi Sermolli (1970) placed it in its own family, Lophosoriaceae Pichi Sermolli, where it was located for a long time. At first it was thought to be a relation of the Cyatheaceae because of the characteristic abaxial sori, or the pattern of gametophyte germination. In the 1990s a close relationship was hypothesized with Metaxyaceae because of characteristics of the petiole and stem morphology but subsequent analyzes suggested that these families were not related (D. S. Conant, unpublished data, cited in Wolf "et al." 1999). On the other hand, ultrastructural studies (using scanning electron microscopy) of the spores (Gastony y Tyron 1976) and recent studies of gametophyte development (Pérez-García "et al." 1995) have concluded that "Lophosoria" differs significantly from the characteristics of other tree ferns, so their relationship to the others remains unknown.
Other researchers, such as Kubitzki in Kramer (1990) have it nested within Dicksoniaceae along with other genera that today are classified in other families of tree ferns. As molecular studies of the species continued, there was an increasingly obvious affinity with the Dicksoniaceae family, such as having the same number of chromosomes, and molecular DNA analysis done on "rbc"L sequence in 1999 also placed it within that family (Wolf "et al." 1999), a relationship that was confirmed in an extensive molecular study of ferns made by Korall et al. (2006, on the sequences atpA, atpB, rps4 and the aforementioned). Because of that the species was placed in the family Dicksoniaceae in its own monotypic genus in Smith's 2006 classification system of monilophytes.
Circumscription: the species consists of at least two varieties, sometimes placed as species of the genus:
The spores of the "contracta" variety are slightly bigger (70 x 75 µm) than those of the "quadripinnata" variety (50 × 60 µm). Furthermore, the "quadripinnata" variety's antheridia are made up of 5 cells: 2 baseline, 2 annular, and a small elliptical operculum, while those of the variety "contracta" are formed by three cells, one basal an annular and operculum (Stockey 1930). They also differ in the morphology of their gametophytes.
Another variety "Lophosoria quadripinnata" variety "quesadae" A.Rojas has also been described in Costa Rica and Panama (Rojas-Alvarado 1996, it was described as "Lophosoria quesadae" species).
Evolution.
[[Image:Gondwana.jpg|frame|right|Lophosoria apparently originated in the early Cretaceous Period, on the southern
continent of Gondwana, and existed when the continent split in the late Cretaceous Period.]]
Dettmann (1986) has remarked that the spores of the extinct genus "Cyatheacidites" correspond very well with living "Lophosoria". The distribution of the "Cyatheacidites" has been used to infer that "Lophosoria" was located in the southern part of Gondwana during the Early Cretaceous Period, and then migrated to Australia and South America (Dettmann 1986).
More recently, Cantrill (1998) described fossilized leaves in the early Cretaceous layer (more specifically in the Aptian) in Antarctica, which contained spores of "Cyatheacidites". The preservation of the leaves and spores was so good that Cantrill could identify the species, and described them by the name of "Lophosoria cupulata" D.J.Cantrill (published as "Lophosoria cupulatus") with the genus change, as he considered "Lophosoria quadripinnata" (J.F.Gmel.) C.Chr. was the living species more closely related to the species found.
Economic importance.
It is used as an ornamental plant in parks and gardens, as well as cut foliage in flower bouquets. The plants used in latter are removed from their natural environment, creating certain local conservation issues. Some local markets in the south of Chile sell their sprouts, called "perritos", for consuming in salads.

Vokes Theatre

The Vokes Theatre, also known as Beatrice Herford's Vokes Theatre, is a 1904 miniature of a London theatre in Wayland, Massachusetts built by and named for Beatrice Herford. The theatre is located on the estate of Herford and her husband, Sidney Hayward.
History.
Herford built the theatre as a tribute to the London music halls that were typical for monologist's performances and in 1946, Herford donated the theatre to the "Vokes Players", a local non-profit group.
For the first 30 years or so of the theatre's life, it was not open to the public. Rather, Herford would invite her friends, who included leading actors on the English-speaking stage, singers, New England artists, and others (it was an eclectic mix) to be her guests at her estate in Wayland. In the theatre, performing only for their own amusement, leading lights of the New York and London stages would perform plays as an ensemble. A wall exists showing the signatures of some of those who came to Wayland including Ellen Terry, George Arliss, Florence Arliss, Katharine Cornell; the house archives show that other guests included diva Geraldine Farrar, and actors Ethel Barrymore, John Drew, Norah Bayes, and others.
Vokes Players.
The name of the resident theater company, "Vokes Players", came as an honor to Herford and Hayward's friend, Rosina Vokes, a British actress who performed as part of the traveling Vokes family. From 1937, the Vokes Players have evolved into one of the premier community theater companies in New England, drawing many artists who work professionally in theater elsewhere. The theatre is currently known as one of the region's preeminent local theatres.

UNICEF in Brazil

The mission of UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) is to ensure that the rights of each and every child and adolescent are fulfilled, respected and protected. Established in 1946 to help in the reconstruction of countries that had suffered most during the Second World War, UNICEF started to work in other countries four years later. Today, UNICEF is the leading advocate for children’s rights, active in 190 countries through country programmes and National Committees.
UNICEF has been working in Brazil since 1950, in partnership with municipal, state and federal governments, civil society, religious groups, the private sector, the media, and international organizations, including other United Nations agencies, to defend the rights of all Brazilian girls and boys.
UNICEF’s work includes a substantive contribution to development through the articulation, monitoring and evaluation, and promotion of public policies for children and adolescents. UNICEF carries out its role objectively and responsibly, guaranteeing the transparency of its actions and developing its programme based on up-to-date survey data. These data enable UNICEF to carry out an accurate diagnosis and analysis of the current situation of children and adolescents in the country.
UNICEF’s Programme of Cooperation with Brazil (2007–2011).
In the countries in which it operates, UNICEF builds its five-year Programme of Cooperation together with government, civil society, and children and adolescents. UNICEF Country Programmes aim to provide positive, sustainable solutions to the problems faced by children and adolescents in the country, with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) used as a benchmark for UNICEF’s work during the five-year period of the Programme.
To establish goals, targets and cooperation priorities with Brazil for the 2007–2011 period, UNICEF set up a highly participative programme involving partners and actors who are relevant to the ‘childhood rights guarantee system’. Due to the vast, continental size of the country, a series of regional meetings were held with the aim of constructing an overview of how children and adolescents live in the different regions of Brazil. The programme fits within the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), which aims to bring synergy and strengthen partnerships and joint programmes undertaken by UNICEF and other United Nations agencies that operate in the country.
During the process of defining solutions for childhood-related problems, the Country Programme goals and objectives for 2007–2011 converged directly with the recommendations expressed in national policy documents designed to positively transform the lives of Brazilian children and adolescents. The partnership between UNICEF and the Brazilian government, with its focus on childhood and adolescence, reflects the commitments of the Millennium Declaration, the MDGs, the ’Pacto Pela Paz’, and the Child Friendly President's Plan of Action.
Priorities for 2007–2011.
To help Brazil advance towards the universalization of the rights of every girl and boy, and to strengthen the capacity of the social actors involved in guaranteeing these rights, UNICEF continues to work with governments, civil society, the private sector, the media, and other international organizations to realize the right of each and every Brazilian child and adolescent to:
Survive and develop.
This goal is directly linked to UNICEF’s mission to help reduce the infant mortality rate. Therefore, it is UNICEF’s priority to guarantee that 21 million Brazilian children, from the prenatal stage up to 6 years of age, are ensured their rights to survive, to have a birth certificate, to be given care and protection, and to fully develop. Investing in early childhood has a decisive impact on children’s survival, growth and on the development of their learning potential. Studies have shown, for example, that for every dollar invested in early childhood, seven dollars will be saved in public compensation and social welfare policies.
Learn.
Brazil has a high rate of children who have access to school. However, there are still 660,000 boys and girls who are not attending school, of whom 450,000 are afro-descendant children. Therefore, the country has to meet the challenge of effectively universalizing the right to access quality education, and also to ensuring that every child and adolescent has his or her right to learn guaranteed.
Protect oneself and others against HIV/AIDS.
The Brazilian response to HIV/AIDS has been recognized as one of the best in the world. Major challenges remain, however, and these must be faced to ensure the universal coverage of prevention, treatment and care for Brazilian children, adolescents and their families.
Grow up without violence.
Violence against children and adolescents can be found in the family, the community, the school and in socio-educational institutions. Many cases are neither reported nor investigated. This vulnerability is even greater amongst children and adolescents with special needs, as well as others, including afro-descendants, indigenous people, adolescents in conflict with the law, street children, and those living in the poor communities of large urban centres. UNICEF works to mobilize governments and society to transform this situation. In addition, UNICEF has supported improved reporting systems and stimulated specialized care, which strengthen both family and community life.
Be first priority in public policies.
For there to be a true social transformation in the lives of children and adolescents, public policy priorities must include improving the lives and well-being of all children and adolescents. This is why UNICEF works to mobilize society to listen to and give opportunities to adolescents, and to teach adults to monitor and evaluate the correct allocation of resources going towards child and adolescent budgets in the federal, state and municipal level of government. This programme component has the clear goal of influencing the adoption of affirmative public policies to improve gender, race and ethnic equality.
Regional Disparities.
The efforts put into guaranteeing children’s rights must also be understood from the point of view of historical regional disparities. Therefore, one cannot forget that to universalize rights, it is necessary to focus on the geographical areas of Brazil where the worst social indicators are concentrated, and where between 60% to more than 70% of children and adolescents live in poverty.
These areas are:
UNICEF works throughout the country, but puts the majority of its human and institutional resources in these three priority geographical areas, to strengthen and stimulate Brazilian citizens to exercise their citizenship rights, transforming them into politically and socially active actors who can participate in the search for solutions to the problems affecting Brazilian children and adolescents.
Resources.
UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments.
This is why UNICEF works on leveraging and mobilizing the resources and experience of a variety of different actors to help guarantee the rights of each and every child and adolescent in Brazil.
Around 50% of UNICEF’s budget in Brazil is obtained from the support of companies and individuals through donations, the purchase of UNICEF greeting cards and gifts, and other related actions.

Henry Gleditsch

Henry Cochrane Williamsen Gleditsch (9 November 1902 – 6 October 1942) was a Norwegian actor and theatre director.
He was born in Kristiania. In his young days he participated in skiing for SFK Lyn.
He made his acting debut in 1923, and in 1937 he established and took charge of Trøndelag Teater in Trondheim. He had a satirical style, provoking the authorities of the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. People warned him and advised him to flee to Sweden, but he did not do so.
Following skirmishes in Majavatn and sabotages in Glomfjord and Malm, conducted by the Norwegian resistance movement, martial law was declared on 6 October 1942 in and around Trondheim, in Nord-Trøndelag and in Grane. In a speech held in the main square in the city center of Trondheims, Josef Terboven declared an imminent crackdown on "those who pull the strings". Henry Gleditsch was executed as a propitiatory reprisal, near Falstad, together with newspaper editor and politician Harald Langhelle and eight other people.

Assembly of Yahweh

The Assembly of Yahweh was the first religious organization in the Sacred Name Movement. It was formed in Holt, Michigan, in the 1930s.
Description.
The Assembly of Yahweh believes the name of the Almighty Yahweh should be used along with his son's name, Yahshua. They keep the seventh day Sabbath (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) along with all the scriptural feast days. They believe the Torah (law) was not done away with. They believe Yahshua is the son of Yahweh and that his life, death, burial, and resurrection give us salvation. They believe after a person repents of sin, they should be baptized in the name of Yahshua.
The Assembly of Yahweh is the oldest known congregation using the Names Yahweh and Yahshua. The earliest fellowship was in the 1930s. They first met in private homes near Lansing, Michigan. Later the assembly was located at The Camp of Yah outside of Eaton Rapids, Michigan. The land was owned by the Smith family, and Pearl Smith was the first pastor of the assembly. For a time after her leadership, the assembly was governed by a group of male elders. Some time in the late 1960s, Samuel Graham was made pastor.
The congregation purchased a one-room school house and an additional a few miles from the original Camp of Yah. They later put a small addition on the original building. In 2008, the group received an anonymous donation to be used for a larger building. The main meeting room now allows up to 200 to meet for worship.
Activities.
The Assembly of Yahweh publishes the "Faith Magazine" and the "Word of Yahweh Bible". They have services every Sabbath at 10:30 am and host all Feast days. During the Feast of Tabernacles, people come from different states and other countries to observe the feast.

Little League World Series (Great Lakes Region)

The Little League World Series competes in the Great Lakes Region which is one of eight United States regions that currently sends teams, the largest youth baseball competition in the world. The region's participation in the LLWS dates back to 1957, when it was known as the Central Region. However, when the LLWS was expanded in 2001 from eight teams (four U.S. teams and four "International" teams from the rest of the world) to 16 teams (eight U.S. and eight International), the Central Region was split into the Great Lakes and Midwest Regions.
The Great Lakes Region has a unique definition that does not correspond with the normally understood definition of the "Great Lakes" area, even when the context is restricted to the U.S. Although eight U.S. states (and the Canadian province of Ontario) border on the Great Lakes, only five of the U.S. states are in Little League's Great Lakes Region:
One state that does not border any of the Great Lakes, and in fact has no territory within the Great Lakes watershed, is included in this region:
Two states that border on the Great Lakes, New York and Pennsylvania, are part of the Mid-Atlantic region. The remaining U.S. state that borders on the Great Lakes, Minnesota, is in the Midwest region. All of Canada, including Ontario, forms a single Little League region.

Norman Watt-Roy

Norman Joseph Watt-Roy (born 15 February 1951, Bombay, India) is the bassist for The Blockheads, previously known as Ian Dury & the Blockheads.
Growing up.
In November 1954, the Watt-Roy family, including Norman, his older brother Garth (born Garth Philip Watt-Roy, December 1947 in Bombay, India) and his sister, moved to England. They settled in Highbury, North London, where Norman went to St Joan of Arc Primary School, Blackstock Road. When Norman was eight, the family relocated to Harlow, Essex. At the age of ten, he had been shown some guitar chords by his father, and played in school bands with his older brother Garth, who started playing in 1961, on lead guitar. Norman Watt-Roy left school at 15 and briefly studied art at Harlow Technical College, before moving back to London.
Early band work.
In early 1967, Norman Watt-Roy formed the band The Living Daylights with his brother Garth and released a single on the Philips label called "Let's Live For Today" (April 1967) and did regular gigs in venues such as The Angel Blues Rooms in Edmonton, London. In 1968, Norman and Garth Watt-Roy formed a nine-piece soul band and toured US military bases in Germany, backing American soul singers such as Sonny Burke and played a summer residency at the Maddocks Club in Spain.
By this time the band was known as The Greatest Show On Earth and by 1969 had won a recording contract with Harvest Records. This led to the release, in February 1970, of the single "Real Cool World", which was a hit in Europe, reaching #1 in Switzerland. The band's debut album "Horizons" was followed by a second album "The Going's Easy", both issued in 1970, and another single "Tell The Story" .
Pre-Blockhead.
In 1972, Watt-Roy joined then band Glencoe and met guitarist John Turnbull. The quartet released two albums "Glencoe" and "The Spirit of Glencoe" along with three singles and four recorded John Peel radio sessions before breaking up, and in 1974 got together with keyboardist Mick Gallagher to form the nucleus of a band which, with the addition of drummer Charlie Charles, would become Loving Awareness (managed by Radio Caroline guru Ronan O'Rahilly). It was while doing a session with Charles for a friend in 1976 that they met Chaz Jankel and Ian Dury and went on to play on the album "New Boots and Panties!!", which was released on the Stiff Records label.
Ian Dury and the Blockheads.
The 'Loving Awareness' quartet were later to join up with Jankel and Dury for the first Stiff Tour of UK and became known as Ian Dury and The Blockheads, releasing two more albums on Stiff and a bevy of singles, achieving a UK #1 in 1979 with "Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick".
It was when Jankel was replaced for a time in 1980 by Wilko Johnson that a rapport between Watt-Roy and Johnson resulted in Watt-Roy becoming a regular member of Johnson's own band by 1985.
Other work.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Watt-Roy did session work, appearing on albums such as Nick Lowe's "Jesus of Cool", Rachel Sweet's "Fool Around" and Jona Lewie's single "You'll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties". He also made an appearance on The Selecter's 1981 album "Celebrate the Bullet" and played on The Clash's "Sandinista!" album along with fellow Blockhead Mick Gallagher on keyboards. Watt-Roy also played bass on their "Cut The Crap" recordings.
In 1983 Watt-Roy provided the original bass line for the Frankie Goes to Hollywood single "Relax" and, in 1984, teamed up with Gallagher again for Wreckless Eric's "Captains of Industry" album.
In 1984 he provided bass on all tracks to Roger Daltrey's solo album "Parting Should Be Painless" on which had one minor hit single "Walking in My Sleep" which featured Ian Dury singing backing vocals and Watt-Roy on the music video.
In 2001 Watt-Roy completed sessions with members of Madness, with whom he sporadically joined for live work at the time, and the ex-producer of Depeche Mode, who had recorded him jamming with drummer Steve Monti with plans to sample the results. Since then he has found work with Nick Cave on Cave's solo shows, without the Bad Seeds, and continued as bassist for Wilko Johnson.
He guested on Viv Albertine's "The Vermillion Border" (Cadiz Music) in 2012 and in 2013 released a solo album, "Faith & Grace", also on Cadiz Music, with guests including former Blockheads drummer Dylan Howe.

Initially filling in for Jennifer Young while she was outside of Korea, he began to appear on a more regular basis from October of the same year. Lumsden was named a regular and official co-host on SeoulPodcast #45, in March 2009.
Death of Michael White.
The SeoulPodcast has been responsible for getting US media attention regarding the death of Stephen Michael White, the son of an American ESL teacher in Korea named Stephannie White. Mike White died under mysterious circumstances and White's mother has felt Korean authorities have not properly investigated the death. The SeoulPodcast's initial interview (May 21, 2008) with White's mother has been released as a transcript and translated by the ESL community into Korean. Two follow up interviews were held on June 25, 2008 and Feb 1, 2009.
The Feb 1st interview was also guested by Lee Ellen Ramsey, sister of Matthew Sellers and Diane Blower, sister of David Gearson. The cause of death for all three victims have not been completely resolved. The three women have come together in their struggle for answers from the South Korean government and closure from the loss of their loved ones.
The court case initiated by Ms White was concluded in August 2009. The courts determined that while a homicide had occurred, the 2.1 million won settlement (roughly 1,800US$ at the time) would be awarded to the defendants, rather than the family, as the defendants had been publicly embarrassed by the case.
Features.
Each episode is segmented into several regular features:
This Week's Sponsor: In addition to the show's actual sponsorship by the "Korea Herald", the podcast runs a fake sponsorship ad that lampoons some aspect of the ESL experience in Korea (for example, the chaotic nature of Korean barbecue restaurants and the cursory service frequently experienced there) The show also claims it is the only podcast sponsored by a Korean king (King Sejong).
Main Topic: Usually the guest host is the main topic, covering the guest's background and life in Korea.
Drink of The Week Preceded by a sting voiced by Lumsden, the hosts and guests discuss the beverage they are drinking during the show's recording.
News and Stuff: A segment where the hosts and guest discuss interesting Korean news items, usually items that affect expats living in Korea, like changes to Korean immigration law.
Things That Make You Go Whaa: Newsworthy items that highlight the uniqueness of or contrasts in the Korean culture.
Time Wasters of the Week: A round up of the odd konglish, engrish signage, and culture shock the hosts have witnessed that week.
Jen's Teachin' Tips: Young presents a short 5 minute tip on how to improve teaching ability and classroom management. Jen's Teachin' Tips have been spun off into their own iTunes feed.
King Sejong's Closing Advice: The show's exit theme includes a voice over by McPherson impersonating the ghostly voice of King Sejong. Sejong closes the show by imparting some advice to ex-pats in Korea. Sejong's tips are usually a play on ideas Koreans have about health that are largely unfamiliar (and occasionally bemusing) to Westerners or Korean customs ex-pats typically stumble over. The advice is usually satirical, for example urging listeners to turn off their fans at night to avoid fan death.

Garry Williamson Barnes

Garry Williamson Barnes (born 24 January 1982), formerly known as Garry Williamson, is an English footballer who played in the Football League for Darlington. He joined West Auckland Town before the 2010–11 season.
Career.
Barnes was born in Darlington and joined his home-town club in 1997. Then known as Garry Williamson, he turned professional in 2000 and made his Football League debut for Darlington on 12 August 2000 as a second-half substitute in a 1–1 draw away at Rochdale. He made five more appearances in League Two, and four in cup competitions, and spent some time on loan at Northern Premier League club Spennymoor United.
At the end of the 2000–01 season, Williamson turned down Darlington's offer of a contract extension, preferring to move to the United States to take up a scholarship at Yavapai College, Arizona, where he led the 2001 offensive rankings for Division 1 of the National Junior College Athletic Association. 
He returned to England and, by then using the surname Barnes, signed for Shildon of the Northern League, for whom he scored 53 goals in 52 appearances in the 2003–04 season, a performance which earned him the award of Northern League Player of the Year, and his 34 league goals made him the season's top scorer. In the same season, Shildon reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup, only to be beaten by Notts County of Division Two – five levels above Shildon – 7–2; Barnes, who had scored eight goals during the qualifying rounds, added a 63rd-minute penalty.
Before the 2005–06 season Barnes left Shildon for rivals Durham City, but a few months later he moved on again, this time to Newcastle Blue Star, with whom he won the Northern League title. He began the next season at Tow Law Town, but joined West Auckland Town during the season, and was leading scorer for the club in 2008–09. He joined Spennymoor Town for the 2009–10 season, but left due to work commitments. Barnes rejoined West Auckland in August 2010.

Forest Way

The Forest Way is a linear Country park providing walking, cycling, horse riding and the quiet enjoyment of the countryside. It runs for around 16 km from East Grinstead to Groombridge.
The Forest Way lies within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the heart of the picturesque East Sussex countryside with the Ashdown Forest lying to the south. It takes the route of a disused railway line and now provides an important habitat for wildlife forming a ‘green corridor’ through the upper valley of the River Medway. The route runs from East Grinstead, via Forest Row, Hartfield, and Withyham to Groombridge.
Walking, cycling and accessibility.
A flat, surfaced track runs along the entire length of the Forest Way providing easy access for disabled users and an ideal place for children to learn to cycle away from traffic. There are toilet facilities at Forest Row. The western end of the Forest Way links up, at East Grinstead, with the Worth Way which extends as far as Three Bridges.
There are a number of circular trails leading from the Forest Way. These vary in length and difficulty. East Sussex County Council provides leaflets giving information on "Forest Way Country Park and circular walks" and "Forest Row walk".
Along the route trees have regenerated naturally on the embankments and cuttings providing an excellent habitat for swallows, badgers, deer and foxes, in the fields and woodlands. 
Forest Way provides access to Weir Wood Reservoir with its plentiful bird life and sailing and to Standen country house designed by Philip Webb which contains fine examples of William Morris designs.
History.
In 1866, a railway line, the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line, opened from East Grinstead through to Tunbridge Wells - an extension of the line from Three Bridges. In 1966 it was closed under the Beeching axe despite being a busy commuter line. Ironically, Dr. Richard Beeching lived at East Grinstead and regularly traveled up to London on the line when he was Chairman of British Rail. The disused railway line was bought by East Sussex County Council in 1971 and designated as a Country Park in 1974. 
Major improvements to the track surface in 2002 led to its inclusion in the Sustrans National Cycle Network. To the west of East Grinstead, the cycle route continues as the Worth Way along the disused section of line to Three Bridges. In addition, there are as yet unrealised plans to link the Forest Way from Groombridge with the Cuckoo Trail, another trail following the route of a disused railway line, which runs from Heathfield to Hampden Park near Eastbourne.

<doc id="18461145" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18461145" title="POL Magazine">
POL Magazine

POL Magazine was a monthly magazine published by Gareth Powell Publishing in Australia in the late 1960s. It is considered to have played an important role in raising awareness of the status of women, and established new standards in terms of content, design and photography. 
In March-May 2003, the Australian National Portrait Gallery in Old Parliament House, Canberra held a retrospective of Pol magazine which it called Portrait of a Generation. A catalog was published for the occasion with an introduction which said:
Gareth Powell has been quoted as saying that the name POL stood for nothing, and was chosen by the magazine's first editor, Richard Walsh, because it was short and lent itself to bad puns in headlines. 
A major influence on the style of the magazine was the photographic and design team that had started with "Chance", one of the early men's magazines in Australia. The photographers were among the best that Australia had produced, and they were given the opportunity with both POL and Chance to choose the photographs used and to decide how they should be displayed. No other magazine in Australia at that time allowed that sort of involvement by the creative staff. The only person who was kept well away from the creative process was the publisher and owner, Gareth Powell. He knew printing - and POL set new standards in that area for Australia - and he knew publishing. But the editorial content of the magazine was, in its earliest and finest days, totally under the control of Richard Walsh and a team which contained many of the great editorial talents of Australia. 
After Richard Walsh's departure, Arnold Earnshaw took over as editor of POL for eight months. The editorship then passed to a couple of other people for a short time. In the early 1980s, Donald Dunstan was editor. It ceased publication in 1986.

Fort Street–Pleasant Street and Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Viaduct

The Fort Street–Pleasant Street and Norfolk & Western Railroad Viaduct is a bridge carrying six lanes of Fort Street over both Pleasant Street and four tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway's Michigan Line in Detroit, Michigan, just west of the Rouge River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is currently closed to road traffic due to construction.
History.
The area along the Fort Street corridor near Pleasant Street was transformed early in the 20th century from a residential community to a substantially industrial center. An undated newspaper clipping from the time on the "passing of Fort Street West" laments, "nce a social center, it is now a great business artery whose splendid mansions have given way before the march of industrial progress." Among other industrial centers in the area, the Ford River Rouge Complex is just upstream from the Fort Road (as it was named at the time) river crossing, making both Fort Road and the Norfolk & Western tracks main transportation arteries in Detroit.
In the 1920s, Fort Road was one of the roads chosen for upgrade to a "superhighway." These roads were upgraded by the city, county and state to feature right-of-ways, central medians, and nighttime lighting. Additionally, with the growth in vehicular traffic in the early 20th century, railroad-highway intersections increasingly became sources of both travel delays and accidents. On 1928, the Wayne County Road Commission and the Michigan State Highway Department announced plans to separate rail and vehicle grades, with railways contributing substantially to the cost. The Fort Road bridge project was the first to be undertaken. 
However, the project had substantial design considerations, resulting in a large cost and a lengthy planning process. The bridge was required to be long enough to permit passage of both two city streets and twelve railroad tracks at an oblique angle; it had to be wide enough to accommodate two paved traffic surfaces for the Fort Superhighway. Construction finally began in summer 1928, and the structure was completed in 1930.
The resulting structure, according to a Wayne County Road Commission at the time, included an "ornamental concrete handrail" supporting "ornamental concrete lamp posts" so that "the entire project will be adequately and beautifully lighted." In subsequent years, the urn-shaped balusters of the original railing have been replaced by solid concrete panels. However, the other components of the railings, including the octagonal lamp posts, remain intact. The loss of the balusters is unfortunate, but the overall scale and significance of the bridge outweighs the minor loss.
Significance.
The Fort Street Viaduct is noteworthy for both its design and size. It was normally cheaper to build a rail road bridge over the street rather than the other way around. However, the large number of tracks at the Fort Road crossing would have required a substantial subway. The Fort Street Viaduct, which stretches in length and includes an roadway, was by far the largest and most ambitious structure included in the 1920s grade separation plan. This bridge exemplifies the importance attached to the grade separation program, as planners tried to increase vehicle safety and decrease congestion.
