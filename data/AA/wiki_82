471st Special Operations Wing

The 471st Special Operations Wing is an inactive United States Air Force wing. The wing was formed through the consolidation of the 471st Bombardment Group and the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing.
The 471st Bombardment Group was a World War II heavy bombardment replacement training unit, last assigned to the First Air Force at Westover Field, Massachusetts, where it was disbanded on 10 April 1944.
The 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing was a United States Air Force special operations wing, last assigned to Thirteenth Air Force at Clark Air Base, Philippines.
History.
World War II.
The 471st Bombardment Group was activated at Alexandria Army Air Base, Louisiana in the spring of 1943 with the 805th, 806th, 807th, and 808th Bombardment Squadrons assigned. The group operated as a Consolidated B-24 Liberator replacement training unit. Replacement training units were oversized units which trained aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters. In January 1944, Second Air Force began to concentrate on Boeing B-29 Superfortress training. The 471st was reassigned to First Air Force and moved to Westover Field, Massachusetts. Training at Westover included long range overwater formation flights.
However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit. This resulted in the 471st, along with other units at Westover, being disbanded in the spring of 1944 and being replaced by the 112th AAF Base Unit (Bombardment (Heavy)), which assumed the group's mission, personnel, and equipment.
Cold War.
In 1951, the USAF created the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. The wing consisted of an operational group assigned four units. The 581st Air Resupply & Communications Squadron (ARCS), the 581st Airborne Materials Assembly Squadron, the 581st Holding and Briefing Squadron, and the 581st Reproduction Squadron. The mission of the 581st ARS was the infiltration, resupply, and exfiltration of guerrilla-type personnel, and the aerial delivery of psychological warfare (PSYWAR) material (leaflets and other similar materials). The wing was also assigned two support groups a communications squadron and a maintenance squadron. 
In early 1952, the 581st received orders to forward deploy to Clark AB, Philippines, and to be assigned to Thirteenth Air Force. The first air resupply and communications wing to deploy overseas, the composite wing arrived at Clark AB, stripped of its support groups and communications squadron, in July 1952. It retained four squadrons specifically tailored to perform the special operations mission and a maintenance squadron. Shortly before deploying, the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Group was reduced to a paper organization and its squadrons were attached to the wing. Of the five squadrons assigned or attached to the wing, the 581st ARCS was the lone squadron devoted to flying operations.
Korean War.
The 581st wing proved to be flexible, and its initial theater deployment plan, outlined in Far East Command Operations Plan (OPLAN) 3–52, capitalized on this flexibility. The OPLAN established a concept of covert operations for theater forward deployment of assigned 581st ARCW assets. A key function of the wing was to maintain the capability to introduce special agents and guerrilla units into Communist countries and Communist-held areas, to supply them by and guerrilla units operating there, and to keep in contact with them by radio for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The mission to introduce and extract special agents into Communist countries operated under the cover of psychological warfare, providing cover against inquiries into their clandestine purpose. Four of the wing's twelve Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, and associated support personnel were placed on a 60-day rotation schedule to Yokota Air Base, Japan, where they were co-located with the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, which also flew the B-29. The wing's B-29s were retrofitted to allow cargo or human "drops" and were stripped of armament, with the exception of the tail gun, and countermeasures in order to lighten their load and increase altitude and range. One crew member was trained as a CIA contact, known as the jumpmaster. The identities of these jumpmasters were kept secret, even from the wing commander who did not know of their CIA connection. However, the wing had a senior officer serving as a liaison with the CIA. This was Lt. Colonel George Pittman, whose identity was also kept secret from those who did not have a need to know.
The four Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar and support personnel were placed on a 90-day rotation schedule. The commander, 315th Air Division determined where the aircraft would be deployed. Two Grumman SA-16 Albatrosses were sent to K-16 (Seoul Airport) in South Korea to augment B Flight of the 6167th Air Base Group. The four Sikorsky H-19A helicopters were also deployed to K-16 to support the 2157th Air Rescue Squadron (in fact, they were co-located with the 2157th but actually supported B Flight, as did the two SA-16s). "34 CCRAK" maintained Operational Control (OPCON) of these forces and employed them into North Korea along with B Flight and Special Air Missions detachment aircraft.
The wing's planes were painted solid black after their arrival at Clark AFB, and they flew long-range leaflet drop missions over North Korea. PSYWAR “leaflet bombs” were loaded with various forms of PSYWAR materiel and then airdropped from high altitude. An altitude-sensitive fuse opened the container at a predetermined set altitude, dependent on pre-mission forecast winds and desired dispersal patterns. 
One of the most sensational missions of the 581st in Korea occurred on 12 January 1953, when a 581st B-29 (tail number 44-62217, call sign "Stardust Four Zero") on its first leaflet drop mission with the Wing Commander, Col. John Arnold (as well as the commander of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Major William (Bill) Baumer) on board, was shot down on their last leaflet target just south of the Yalu River in far northern Korea near the Chinese town of Antung. At the time, Russian fighter squadrons, some equipped for night flying, were supporting and supplying the Chinese with airpower. Twelve Russian MiG-15s from the 351st (and perhaps the 535th) Fighter Air Regiments intercepted the lone Superfortress south of the Yalu River, about 15 miles from the Chinese border. The MiGs were scrambled and vectored to the bomber's location by Russian radar-controlled searchlight units stationed near Antung, China. The searchlights illuminated the unarmed Superfortress and several MiGs engaged the bomber. Russian MiG pilot Senior Lt. Khabiev of the 351st regiment was credited with the intercept and downing of the B-29. Although US sources believe the B-29 was flying in North Korean airspace at the time of its mayday call, a belief that is strongly disputed by the Chinese and Russian authorities, crew members who bailed out believe they landed in North Korean territory. Upon capture, the crew was rounded up, blindfolded and put aboard trucks, subsequently transported into China and later charged as CIA spies (the Chinese subsequently learned of the CIA connection with the air resupply units). During the highly publicized Chinese trial in Baijing in October 1954, the surviving crew members, along with captured CIA agents Fecteau and Downey, who were imprisoned two years earlier after they had been shot down while attempting to pick up their Chinese double agent, were given prison sentences ranging from 5 years to life. Not until 4 August 1955, two years after the Korean War Armistice, were the surviving Stardust Four Zero crew members released from Chinese prison. These crew members were the longest held POW USAF captives of the war.
First Indochina War.
Beginning in 1953, however, the wing's C-119s began to be employed in Southeast Asia in support of French operations in Indochina. Supplies, including ammunition, vehicles, and barbed wire, were delivered to Haiphong Airfield in ever increasing quantities. As this operation was underway, the wing was inactivated and its 581st Air Resupply Group, which received the wing's remaining assets, was transferred to control of Thirteenth Air Force.

582nd Air Resupply and Communications Wing

The 582d Air Resupply and Communications Wing (582d ARCS) is an inactive United States Air Force wing. Its last duty assignment was at RAF Molesworth, England.
History.
The 582d ARW was activated at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho on 24 September 1952. As the previous two wings had done, the 582d spent its first year at Mountain Home AFB training and preparing assigned personnel for its PSYWAR mission. Having been newly redesignated the 582d Air Resupply Group, it deployed from Mountain Home AFB to RAF Molesworth, United Kingdom (UK), and set up operations in Europe in February 1954.
The 582d was assigned directly to Third Air Force and provided the bulk of its air support to the Army 10th Special Forces Group, which had been transferred in total from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Bad Tölz, West Germany. For the next two and one-half years, the 582d worked closely with the 10th Group providing airdrop, resupply, and airland support with its assigned B-29 and C-119 aircraft.
The versatile SA-16 was utilized for amphibious missions, including night water-infiltration/exfiltration operations. Assigned SA-16s were also tasked to fly classified courier missions throughout the Mediterranean, Middle East and southern Europe.
On 25 October 1956 the 582d was reorganized and reflagged as the 42d Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium (Special). The 42d flew HU-16s, C-47s, C-119s and C-54 Douglas Skymaster cargo transport aircraft from Molesworth until 3 May 1957 when it moved 13 miles up the road to RAF Alconbury. However the squadron had a short life at Alconbury and was inactivated on 8 December 1957. The C-54s and C-47s were sent to Rhein-Main Air Base West Germany, and the C-119s were sent to the 322nd Air Division at Evreux-Fauville Air Base France.

Battle of Piqua

The Battle of Piqua, also known as the Battle of Pekowee or Pekowi, was part of the western campaign during the American Revolutionary War. Led by General George Rogers Clark, over 1,000 soldiers (among them Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton) crossed the Ohio River near present-day Cincinnati and burned five Shawnee villages, including Old Chillicothe, along the Little Miami River. Peter Loramie's Store, a British trading post-located in what was later Fort Loramie, Ohio in Shelby County, Ohio-, was also burned by Clark's men. The Shawnee gradually withdrew during the first few days before finally engaging American forces 7 miles west of Springfield, Ohio on August 8, 1780. Joseph Rogers, a cousin of George Rogers Clark, had previously accompanied him to Kentucky and was later captured by the Shawnee near Maysville. Despite having been adopted by the tribe, he was killed during the battle while trying to join American forces.
After several hours of fighting, both sides suffered moderate casualties before scattering the small Shawnee rearguard. The campaign against the Shawnee in the Miami River Valley was intended to discourage further raids against Kentucky and other parts of the American frontier, and while no further raids were made by the Shawnee for the remainder of the American Revolutionary War, hostility greatly increased among the tribes living in the Ohio Country for years afterwards.
The battle was the only major engagement fought in Ohio during the American Revolutionary War and a memorial trail and state park, the George Rogers Clark Memorial () and Tecumseh State Park, was later built on the site of the battle by the Clark County Historical Society.
An official ceremony was held on the 142nd anniversary to commemorate a monument to George Rogers Clark, a 18 ft. marble statue, as well as the birthplace of Tecumseh. The park was enlarged in 1930 and, on the sesquicentennial celebration of the battle, an historical conference was held at nearby Wittenberg College on October 9, 1930.

End of the World (1931 film)

End of the World () is a 1931 French science fiction film directed by Abel Gance based on the novel "" by Camille Flammarion. The film stars Victor Francen as Martial Novalic, Colette Darfeuil as Genevieve de Murcie, Abel Gance as Jean Novalic, and Jeanne Brindau as Madame Novalic. The plot concerns a comet hurling toward Earth on a collision course and the different reactions to people on the impending disaster. Scientist Martial Novalic who discovers the comet, seeks a solution to the problem and becomes a fugitive after skeptical authorities blame him for starting a mass panic.
"End of the World" was director Abel Gance's first sound film. The original film was to be over three hours long, but the backing production took the film from Gance, and cut it to be 105 minutes. It was again cut on its release in the United States under the title of "Paris after Dark". Both abridged versions of the film were not well received by audiences or critics.
Plot.
The film opens with Jean Novalic (Abel Gance) playing Jesus Christ in a passion play. Isabelle Bolin (Sylvie Grenade) attends with her boyfriend stock promoter Schomburg (Samson Fainsilber) who is entranced by the blonde actress playing Mary Magdalene, Genevieve de Murcie (Colette Darfeuil). Genevieve defies her scientist father Monsieur de Murcie (Jean d'Yd) to propose to Jean, who tells her that they cannot marry. Back home, Genevieve's father, jealous of the wealthy Martial Novalic (Victor Francen)'s fame, accepts money from Schomburg to build an observatory better than Novalic's. Schomburg then announces his intention to court de Murcie's daughter.
As Jean aids a young woman being abused, he is accused of rape and is critically wounded by a blow to the head. Schomburg accompanies Genevieve to a fancy party, but takes her back to her apartment and rapes her. In his observatory, Martial detects the Lexell's Comet is on a collision course with Earth. Jean himself begins to predict a coming apocalypse, and claims that the cataclysm has arrived to "save the hearts of man". Martial confides to his colleagues that the comet will strike in 114 days. After Jean is taken to an asylum, Martial and Genevieve listen to his phonographs which instruct Genevieve to abandon her worldly life and help Martial inaugurate a new World Government. Jean's voice tells them they must marry and become the shepherd and shepherdess of humanity. Genevieve sees a vision of Jean as Christ.
With 92 days left, Schomburg invests heavily in armaments while Martial goes to the rich Werster and tells him that the world will end. Motivated to help, Werster deals with Schomburg and gives Martial money to buy a newspaper and a broadcast station. Genevieve has remained single but helps to organize Radio Martial Novalic's broadcasts of peace bulletins. Martial's confederates jam official radio news, blocking warnings that war mobilization is imminent. Martial announces the coming end of the world. Stock markets plunge around the globe but Schomburg continues to buy. De Murcie and Schomburg accuse Novalic of kidnapping Genevieve and using the Comet as a hoax to destroy the economy. A government minister orders the exchanges closed and the arrest of Martial and Werster. But Martial's agents learn of the arrest warrant with a hidden microphone. The newspaper is confiscated and the radio station destroyed, and Martial and Werster escape.
The government hides the truth which allows the stock market to recover. Schomberg holds a party the very night Martial claims that the Comet will become visible. Schomnberg tells gangsters he'll pay a million Francs if Martial and Werster are found dead before morning. Genevieve returns to her father and joins Schomburg in the garden; the jealous Isabelle runs to warn Martial Novalic. At the party, the comet comes into sight. Isabelle helps Martial escape and learns that war mobilization will soon be announced. He and Werster rush to destroy the government's radio antenna in the Eiffel Tower. Genvieve tips off Martial by telephone that Schomburg and his killers are ascending in an elevator. Werster warns Genevieve to stay on the ground and uses a cutting torch to sever the elevator cable, but Genevieve had taken the elevator as well and is killed with the rest.
The world can now see the Lexell's Comet with their own eyes, and Radio Novalic resumes broadcasting. Martial calls for the first convention of the "General States of the Universe" on August 5, the night before the collision. People around the world begin to pray as the comet looms larger in the sky and extreme weather ensues including blizzards, storms, tidal waves. Riots break out and a thousand elite revelers bring musicians into a great hall for a feast and orgy. Monks carrying candles interrupt the orgy and lead the group in prayer. As the orbits of the Comet and the earth converge, Martial Novalic addresses the One World Congress, which unanimously agrees to unite all governments into a single harmonious entity. The Lexell's Comet narrowly misses the earth. Much of the world has been reduced to rubble, but life will go on.
Production.
Director Abel Gance had meditated on the idea of "End of the World" since 1913 and after creating the film "Napoleon" in 1927, he convinced himself and backers to go forward with the project. Gance originally was going to title film "The End of the World, as Seen, Heard and Rendered, by Abel Gance". Filming began in mid-1929 and was finished roughly a year later. The film had been edited to a running time of just over three hours. When the backers felt that the film was becoming far too long, they took production control away from Gance and cut the film to a shorter length.
Release.
The film was released in France in January 1931 under the title "La Fin du monde" at a rough length of 105 minutes and was never shown in the United States in this form. Although American director Cecil B. DeMille showed interest in purchasing the rights to the film, it was released in 1934 by American film distributor Harold Auten who trimmed the running time to 54 minutes in the fashion of various exploitation films of the time. Auten's version was re-titled "Paris After Dark" and included a new opening by Dr. Clyde Fisher discussing the scientific nature of the film. Auten version of the film removed most of the film's dialogue filling it with title cards and made the leading character Jean Novalic into a minor character who only has a few scenes in the background.
Reception.
The film received a disastrous reception from audiences and critics alike. Contemporary critic Philippe Soupault described it as "portentously naive" and "blatantly unrealistic". Director Abel Gance himself referred to the film as "an abortive work" ruined by the producer taking the film away from him so he could edit it himself.
The lack of success of "End of the World" forced Gance to turn to more conventional projects in order to continue work as a filmmaker.

Oversinging

Oversinging is "singing too much", or simply overdoing the singing.
The meaning.
Oversinging is not a word found in common dictionaries, but it is a well-known phenomenon. Using an oversimplified example one could say that a singer oversings by "singing too much", as an actor overacts by "acting too much".
There are different opinions on what oversinging implies, though it usually implies one or both of the following:
Oversinging has two meanings. One is a technical understanding, where oversinging is understood as "pushing the voice", and "is when a singer pushes too much breath pressure through the larynx", which is known as overblowing of the vocal folds. The result is over-production of sound.
The other meaning is what is known as "vocal gymnastics". This will imply melisma, and is described by Hollywood vocal coach Roger Burnley as "using too many riffs, runs, and embellishments in their singing".
Singers who try to impress, and show off their vocal abilities, often turn to this kind of oversinging.
When asked about oversinging, professor and voice instructor Melinda Imthurn writes:
Since oversinging is not a technical term, it's hard to define. To one person it might mean pushing the voice beyond healthy singing technique, while to another it might mean embellishing a song too much, sometimes to the point where the melody is no longer recognizable.
Critique.
Many complain that contestants in shows such as Idol tend to oversing, and blame some of the most prominent American female singers for inspiring them. Some say it has been a rising trend following the many singing contests that started appearing in the early 2000, especially in the United States.
Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Ariana Grande, Céline Dion, Beyoncé Knowles and Whitney Houston are well known for their heavy use of melisma and belting, and they have all been criticized for oversinging. This criticism is mainly focused on too much "vocal gymnastics" which some feel degrades the artistic merits of the song, and not necessarily that they strain their voices too much.
While Burnley believes all of those divas to be oversingers in their own right, [Hollywood vocal coach, Chrys Page argues the opposite. "They don't oversing, but some young hopefuls, trying to sound exactly like those artists, consistently do it because they haven't yet found their own voice and style," she said.
When amateurs on shows like Idol are criticized for oversinging it can be both because they do too much "vocal gymnastics" and that they strain their voice beyond their vocal capability when trying to mimic famous singers with far greater voices and training.
Professional opera singer Sarah-Jane Dale on Whitney Houston's use of melisma:
"You can't do it without proper breath control, and that's the one thing that Whitney Houston had bags of. Let's face it, singers like that do not come along every week."
Vocal damage.
Straining the singing voice, for instance by using belting without proper coordination, can lead to forcing, which in turn can cause vocal deterioration, known as fatigue of the vocal cords, or vocal fatigue. Straining the voice can lead the development of vocal nodules, a form of scaring on the vocal chords caused by strenuous or abusive voice practices. Professional singers on extended tours with tight schedules run a substantial risk of damaging their voices unless they make sure to rest the vocal cords and get enough sleep and proper diet.
Some famous singers known to have developed vocal nodules are Luciano Pavarotti, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Freddie Mercury (who refused to have surgery out of fear that it would permanently damage his voice) and Joss Stone.
Singers known to have their vocal nodules surgically treated are Justin Timberlake, Adele, Björk, Shirley Manson, Keith Urban, John Mayer and Rod Stewart. Julie Andrews is well known for her singing voice being permanently damaged by the surgery. Elton John is notable for having vocal surgery, as it caused his voice to significantly deepen.

Gerry Weigall

Gerald John Villiers Weigall (19 October 1870 – 17 May 1944) was an English cricketer.
Family.
Born in Wimbledon, Weigall was the son of a Victorian artist Henry Weigall (best known for his portrait of Disraeli in 1878–1879) and his wife Lady Rose Fane, daughter of John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland. A younger brother was Lieutenant Colonel Sir William Ernest George Archibald Weigall, 1st Baronet KCMG, a Conservative MP who was Governor of South Australia.
He married, in 1897, Josephine Harrison and they had issue.
Career.
Gerry Weigall was educated at Wellington College before going up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1889. He made his first-class debut for Kent County Cricket Club as an opening batsman against MCC in 1891; scoring a half-century in the second innings, before achieving his Cambridge blue later in the season. An all-round sportsman, he also represented Cambridge in rackets, and popularised squash — a sport he played into his seventies.
A defensive batsman with a strong cut shot, he often batted down the order after leaving Cambridge and often added useful runs, including his highest first-class score of 138 not out which helped Kent to victory over the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in 1897.
Following his playing career, Weigall became a coach, coaching young players from Kent's Tonbridge stable and the second eleven. He is credited with the discovery of Les Ames; who went on to play in 47 Test matches for England. He also coached Yorkshire's colts side for a time. As a coach, he was noted as a "stickler for orthodox batting", and would demonstrate a perfect technique with items ranging from borrowed bats to umbrellas.
He was a great character. According to E.W. Swanton, "He always had a few pet bees buzzing around in his bonnet, and used to inveigh against the criminal folly of selectors and authority generally if their view did not match his own." When Maurice Leyland was preferred to Frank Woolley in the touring party to Australia in 1928-9, he fulminated against the selection of a "cross-batted village-greener". When he scored 63* in the 1892 University Match, three of the best Cambridge batsmen were run out during his innings, including no less a figure than F.S. Jackson, his captain. When it appeared that one of them would have to go, Weigall is supposed to have sacrificed his partner by calling: "Get back, Jacker. I'm set." Swanton sums him up thus: "... he may well sound a rather preposterous fellow... I can only say that every cricketer was his friend, and that he never spoke an unkind word about anyone."
He died in a Dublin hospital on 17 May 1944; "troubled by illness from the outbreak of war"

1982–83 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1982-83 campaign was one of Town's most successful seasons in their recent history. Under the leadership of Mick Buxton, Town managed to secure their second promotion in 4 seasons, following their promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1979-80 season. This is also the only season in Town's history to date, in which they were unbeaten at home all season. They finished 3rd, behind Portsmouth and Cardiff City.
Review.
Town had failed to get the good start to the season that they wanted by failing to win any of their first 5 league games. Following that start Mick Buxton made an inspired signing, the Liverpool striker Colin Russell. He scored two goals on his debut in Town's 2-0 win over Oxford United, which was followed by a 6-0 thrashing of Orient. Then, following a 3 game mini-blip, Town went on a run of 7 wins in a row. During that run, Mark Lillis scored 9 goals in 4 games, including 4 against Cardiff City.
As that run was winding down, Town also managed a sensational 1-0 win at Leeds United in the Milk Cup third round, in which David Cowling scored the famous header that knocked Town's rivals. They also gave a good thrashing to their other rivals Bradford City on New Year's Day, by beating them 6-3, in which Brian Stanton scored 4 times. Town's home form along with the goalscoring abilities of Mark Lillis, Colin Russell and Brian Stanton gave Town their only season in their history in which they didn't lose a single home game in any competition.
Town continued their run of good form for most of the remainder of the season and promotion was secured by beating promotion rivals Newport County at Leeds Road, which saw Town get promoted to Division 2 along with Portsmouth & Cardiff City.

Cambodian–Thai border dispute

The Cambodian–Thai border dispute began in June 2008 as the latest round of a century-long dispute between Cambodia and Thailand involving the area surrounding the 11th-century Preah Vihear Temple, located in the Dângrêk Mountains between the Choam Khsant district in the Preah Vihear province of northern Cambodia and the Kantharalak district ("amphoe") in the Sisaket province of northeastern Thailand.
According to the Cambodian ambassador to the United Nations, the most recent dispute began on July 15, 2008 when about 50 Thai soldiers moved into the Keo Sikha Kiri Svara pagoda vicinity which he claims is located in Cambodia's territory about from the Temple of Preah Vihear. Thailand claims the demarcation has not yet been completed for the external parts of the area adjacent to the temple, which was adjudged to be Cambodian by a 9 to 3 decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1962. By August 2008, the dispute had expanded to the 13th century Ta Moan temple complex west of Preah Vihear (), where Cambodia has accused Thai troops of occupying a temple complex it claims is on Cambodian land. The Thai foreign ministry denied that any troops had moved into that area until several were killed in an encounter in April 2011. An agreement was reached in December 2011 to withdraw troops from the disputed area.
On November 11, 2013, the ICJ declared in a unanimous decision that the 1962 ICJ judgment had awarded all of the promontory of Preah Vihear to Cambodia and that Thailand had an obligation to withdraw any stationed Thai military, police, or guard forces from that area. However, it rejected Cambodia's argument that the judgment had also awarded the hill of Phnom Trap to Cambodia, finding that it had made no ruling on sovereignty over the hill.
Background.
The Preah Vihear temple area has been the subject of often rancorous debate within Cambodia and Thailand and between the two countries since the late 19th century.
The temple complex was built during the 9th and 10th centuries AD under the auspices of the Khmer Empire. As the empire reached its zenith and began a slow decline, the Ayutthaya Kingdom began to grow into the modern state of Thailand. Siam and Vietnam expanded into Cambodian territory in turn during the Ayutthaya, Thonburi, and Rattanakosin eras.
The Franco-Siamese treaty of 1867 forced Siam to renounce suzerainty over Cambodia, with the exception of Battambang, Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Oddar Meancheay provinces, which had been officially incorporated into the Kingdom of Siam. During the 1904 state visit of King Rama V to France, Siam agreed to cede the four provinces to France in exchange for regaining Thai sovereignty over Trat Province and Amphoe Dan Sai of Loei Province, which had been occupied by France.
In 1907 the Thai-Cambodian border was mapped by the French on behalf of a bilateral border commission. According to the 1904 agreement, the border would follow the natural watershed between the countries. However, the resulting map deviated by showing Preah Vihear Temple as being in Cambodia, even though it is on the Thai side of the watershed. Unaware of this, Thailand accepted the map for official use. The Thais discovered the error when they made their own survey in the 1930s, but the ICJ ruled that they had waited too long to protest and lost the temple by "acquiesance".
Immediately prior to World War II, the Thai government attempted to negotiate an adjustment of the border with French Indo-China. However, this came to an end with the French surrender in 1940 to Nazi Germany. The government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram then pressed the colonial government of French Indo-China for the return of territory Thailand had lost in the 1904 and 1907 exchanges: Battambang Province of Thailand (modern day Battambang Province and Pailin municipality, Cambodia), Phibunsongkhram (modern day Siem Reap, Oddar Meancheay, and Banteay Meanchey provinces, Cambodia), Nakhon Champa Sak Province (modern day Champassack Province and Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia), and Saiyaburi province of Laos (modern day Xaignabouli, Laos); "(See map below) " The French colonial government refused to comply and fighting broke out along the border. In December 1940, Phibunsongkhram ordered an outright invasion of French Indo-China, starting the French-Thai War. The Thai army and air force was better equipped and had the advantage of numbers against the Colonial French forces; they pushed back the French Foreign Legion and French colonial troops with little difficulty. However, the more modern French Navy caught the Thai fleet by surprise and won a decisive victory in the Battle of Koh Chang. Imperial Japan intervened to mediate the conflict, concerned that the conflict would affect their own plans for Southeast Asia. A general armistice was declared on January 28, 1941. On May 9 a peace treaty was signed in Tokyo, the French being coerced by the Japanese into relinquishing their claim on the territories demanded by Thailand.
On December 7, 1941, a few hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan demanded the right to move troops across Thailand to the Malayan frontier. Before the Thais could respond, the Japanese Invasion of Thailand began across the Cambodian border and at seven points along the sea coast. The Thai forces resisted courageously, but were soon beaten soundly by the Japanese. After only six or seven hours, the deeply worried Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram arrived in Bangkok and ordered an immediate ceasefire. Japan was reluctantly granted free passage, and after Japan's easy conquest of Singapore, Phibunsongkhram signed a military alliance with Japan on December 21, 1941. It contained a secret protocol in which Tokyo agreed to help Thailand regain the territories it had lost to the British and French colonial powers. In exchange, Thailand promised to assist Japan in its war against the Allies.
After the end of the war, Prime Minister Pridi Phanomyong agreed to return the "liberated" territories to France, in return for him and Thailand not being regarded as an aggressor nor a member of the Axis Powers. He also requested admission to the newly created United Nations. Initially, both the UK and the Soviet Union regarded Thailand as an aggressor, despite its active anti-Japanese underground movement. The United States intervened in gratitude to the Free Thai Movement and prevailed on its wartime allies to agree.
With Cambodian Independence and the French withdrawal in 1953, the Thai military occupied Preah Vihear Temple in 1954 in keeping with the border line of the natural watershed. The temple had been built facing north to serve the plains above it, not those of the Cambodian plain far below. However, based on the 1907 French map, Cambodia protested, insisting that it was inside their territory. Both countries finally agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice and abide by its decision.
In 1962 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) awarded ownership of Preah Vihear Temple to Cambodia by a 9 to 3 vote, stating the 1907 map clearly showed Preah Vihear as being in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the court had only ruled that the temple belong to Cambodia, and did not comment on the adjacent land to the north. Thailand reluctantly handed over the temple but continues to claim the surrounding area, insisting the border has never officially been demarcated here.
The ownership dispute returned in recent years when Cambodia submitted an application to UNESCO requesting that Preah Vihear be designated as a World Heritage site. Thailand contended the application requested the designation include the land surrounding the temple, which Thailand still considers its territory. In the interest of cross-border relations Cambodia withdrew the application, and after winning support from Thailand, submitted a modified map requesting the designation only for the temple itself.
The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), a right wing Thai protest group, turned the temple into a cause célèbre wedge issue in its battles against the People Power Party government of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej in their attempts to unseat the former and current Cabinet of Thailand. In 2006 PAD-led street protests led first to the Thai general election of April 2006, largely boycotted by the opposition and won by then-incumbent Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai Party. This was followed by the military coup of June 2006, which ousted Shinawatra, the caretaker Prime Minister. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej was viewed as a proxy for the self-exiled Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives abroad to avoid his conviction for corruption.
Across the border, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) government of Prime Minister Hun Sen used the possibly coincidental timing of UNESCO's annual meeting and the listing of the temple as a World Heritage site in campaigning for the July 27, 2008 parliamentary election.
Timeline.
Clashes.
September 2011 "Football diplomacy".
The general election resulted in a decisive victory for the Pheu Thai Party, with their leader, Yingluck Shinawatra, replacing Abhist as Prime Minister on August 5, 2011. Many United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD – also called "Red Shirts") members were elected to the House of Representatives ("MPs" in press reports.) Core UDD leaders arranged with Cambodian PM Hun Sen for a friendly football match to be played in Phnom Penh's Olympic Stadium on September 24. MP–and–UDD leaders Jatuporn Prompan and Natthawut Saikua were prohibited from leaving the country due to pending charges arising from the 2010 Thai political protests, so an attorney petitioned the Criminal Court for permission for them to travel to Cambodia for the game. Former Thai premier Somchai Wongsawat led the Thai side. Cambodian premier Hun Sen led his side to a 10–7 victory, following which he announced that "the nightmare era" between Thailand and Cambodia was over. Former foreign minister Kasit Piromya rejoined that Hun Sen should not think that he could benefit from close ties with ousted former Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra and the ruling Pheu Thai Party. "Don't think that you will get at our natural resources and territory by be-friending or playing football with the Pheu Thai MPs," he said.
December 2011.
On December 15, armies of both sides exchanged gunfire along the border in Koh Kong Province. The armed clash erupted at 1:45 pm in Zone 329 in Ta Min mountain after a Thai helicopter tried to land in Cambodian territory. No injuries or deaths were reported. The source said the Cambodian soldiers opened fire to prevent the Thai helicopter entering Cambodia and that the Thai soldiers responded with heavy gunfire. It was the first armed clash since Thailand's new government was formed in August.
Arbitration.
On 28 April 2011 Cambodia filed a request for interpretation of the 1962 judgment, as well as a request for the indication of provisional measures, in the Registry of the International Court of Justice. On 18 July 2011 the Court rejected Thailand's attempt to have the case dismissed and indicated provisional measures requiring both states to withdraw their soldiers from a "provisional demilitarized zone" containing the area in dispute and some of its environs, continue their co-operation with ASEAN and observers appointed by it, and refrain from doing anything that might "aggravate or extend the dispute".
On 11 November 2013 the International Court of Justice gave judgment, ruling that the 1962 judgment awarded all of the promontory to Cambodia and ordering the withdrawal of Thai soldiers. This followed a tense buildup to the decision in which dozens of Thai schools had closed ahead of the ruling.
The Court first concluded that it had jurisdiction and the request for interpretation was admissible, finding that a "dispute exists between the Parties as to the meaning and scope of the 1962 judgment pursuant to Article 60 of the Statute the ICJ." it involved an issue of "territorial sovereignty...and that it was not engaged in delimiting the frontier"; the "Annex I map played a central role in the reasoning of the Court..."; The Court unanimously declared:
The Court therefore concludes that the first operative paragraph of the 1962 Judgment determined that Cambodia had sovereignty over the whole territory of the promontory of Preah Vihear, as defined in paragraph 98 of the present Judgment, and that, in consequence, the second operative paragraph required Thailand to withdraw from that territory the Thai military or police forces, or other guards or keepers, that were stationed there.
However, the Court rejected Cambodia's argument that Phnom Trap had also been awarded to it by the 1962 judgment, concluding that the reference to the "vicinity" of the Temple of Preah Vihear in the operative part of the 1962 judgment was not intended to extend to it. Phnom Trap, known by Thais as Phu Ma-khuea (ภูมะเขือ, "Solanum Hill"), is the hill immediately northwest of the Preah Vihear promontory and its area comprises over 4 km2 of the "4.6 square km" that both states agreed was in dispute.
Prior to the verdict, hundreds of Thai villagers left the area in expectation of the ruling to be unfavorable to them. There were also fears of renewed clashes amid rising nationalist rhetoric.
Civilian effects.
After the initial attack on February 4, 2011, the Cambodian army fired BM-21 Grad rockets into the town of Sao Thong Chai located about from the border. As a direct result, primary schools, a local hospital, and 4–5 houses were destroyed. Only minutes before the bombardment, the local authority had issued a warning to the locals to evacuate and close the school. Despite this, one civilian was killed and at least 34 were injured in the rocket attack. There are reports that 22,000 Thai citizens had to evacuate and abandon their homes. The Cambodian government blamed the Thai army for firing onto the World Heritage temple, causing severe damage, whereas the Cambodian army settled the site as an army base. There is evidence, such as video and photo footage from Reuters, showing that Cambodian forces used the temple as a military base and fired machine guns and artillery. Thai soldiers responded by firing rifles at the Cambodian soldiers hiding on the temple. However, there are only a few bullet scratches on the temple. The AFP reported that Cambodian troops were stationed in the temple.
Thai army was accused of using cluster munitions against Cambodia during the border fighting in February. Thailand at first denied the allegation, but later admitted it had fired the weapons. According to the Cluster Munition Coalition, thousands of Cambodian villagers are now at risk of death or serious injury because of unexploded ordnance near their homes.
Reactions.
International.
Many Asian nations, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, China, and Vietnam, as well as Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have called on both sides to exercise restraint. Thailand and Cambodia agreed to allow Indonesian monitors to go to the border between the two countries to help prevent further military clashes; Indonesia was appointed as observer in this dispute.
Local.
Despite the 1976 Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, which commits parties to resolve intrastate conflict without violence, and the 2000 Memorandum of Understanding between Cambodia and Thailand, which established a Joint Border Commission to peacefully resolve overlapping claims, important constituent groups in Thailand, including the "Yellow Shirts," maintain that the status of Preah Vihear remains unresolved.
Villagers from Ban Phum Srol denounced plans by the People's Alliance for Democracy ("Yellow Shirts") to bring relief supplies. "You have created the war. You troubled us. We don't welcome you," said Wichit Duangkaew, 46.
Police arrested a Thai, a Cambodian, and a Vietnamese in Si Sa Ket's Kantharalak district, near the Thai-Cambodian border. The suspects carried maps with military bases marked on them, but they denied they were spying.
According to Michael Montesano, a visiting research fellow on Thai history and regional affairs at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, "They're people who say that Hun Sen's playing up the situation on the Thai border is a way to distract the Cambodian people from his much softer stance vis a vis Vietnam relating to poorly demarcated borders."

Lorillard's father made the first American tobacco fortune by developing a tobacco firm that he started in 1760. Originally the business was a snuff-grinding factory located in a rented house in lower Manhattan. It was called "Lorillard's Snuff and Tobacco" company and sometimes, the name was abbreviated as, "J. Lorillard". Later the firm moved to a better location on the Bronx River. Lorillard II took over and continued to manage and operate the family business after his father's death in 1776.
Social clubs.
Lorillard II was a member of several social clubs, including the Meadow Brook Hunt Country Club (a fox hunting club, and the Narragansett Gun Club. He often is associated with Tuxedo Park, since between 1802 and 1812 he purchased the first tracts of land upon which it later would be developed. The village and the surrounding area were developed in 1886 by his grandson, Pierre Lorillard IV, as a resort for socially prominent people. 
Death.
Lorillard died in May 1843 at the age of 79, outliving his brothers George and Jacob. A newspaper reporter then writing his obituary tried to describe an extremely wealthy American and used the relatively new word, ""millionaire"". 
While the word "millionaire" had been in use in the United Kingdom since at least 1816, apparently it was used for the first time in the United States in 1843 when it was used to describe Lorillard, although he was not the first American to own one million dollars' worth of property. While he was one of the wealthiest men in America, he was not the richest at the time, that being John Jacob Astor. Lorillard just happened to have been the first to be called a "millionaire" in newspapers. Cleveland Amory incorrectly reports that it was in Lorillard's 1843 obituary that the first use of the word ""millionaire"" was put in print anywhere. 
Philip Hone, one-time mayor of New York, wrote in his famous diary about Lorillard,

Shinya Kimura

Shinya Kimura is a Japanese born Custom motorcycle builder. Kimura founded Zero Engineering in 1992 and Chabott Engineering in 2002. He is the originator of the "zero style" custom bike.
Biography.
Zero Engineering.
Kimura founded Zero Engineering in Okazaki Japan in 1992. Initially his shop was named Repair Shop Chabo but the name was changed the following year to Zero Engineering. He soon gained a reputation for his minimalistic and vintage looking bikes that combine form and function. His name was soon synonymous with what people often refer to as Zero-style. A Zero-style bike is typically based around a rigid gooseneck, a pre-1984 Harley Davidson engine, springer front end, spoked wheels and often includes parts of the bike remaining in bare metal. The inspiration came from wabi sabi (austere refinement) and the beauty of the raw materials and incorporating the essence of wa (harmony) into his designs. Kimura and his crew were also known for putting their work to the test by participating in different vintage race series with their motorcycles.
In 2002 Kimura expanded his business by opening an office in Las Vegas, Nevada,
where he in 2005 built his entry the Biker Build-Off against Joe Martin from the Martin Brothers. other bikes were built in 10 days in front of a film crew, the riders then met up in Las Vegas and rode to Palm Springs, California where a popular vote was held which Joe Martin won.
Currently Kimura has left Zero Engineering and launched his own studio called Chabott Engineering in Azusa, California. Zero Engineering is still in Japan and in Las Vegas which have to this date created more the 200 custom bikes, including the new line of production bikes built in their facility in Las Vegas. At this time it includes to models based on Harley Davidson's Shovelhead and Evolution engine with two models based on the Sportster being released in the future. Recently two of the company's bikes were used in the 2008 film "Iron Man".
Chabott Engineering.
In 2006 Kimura set up his own shop and named Chabott Engineering to build both custom bikes as well as moving himself toward the world of art.
Kimura said, "Since setting up in America, I've moved from being just a custom-bike builder to slightly changing my direction a little more toward the world of art. I don't know whether success or failure is awaiting me in the future. Can custom bikes become art? Maybe we'll know in 10 years' time."
Along with fellow bike builders Jesse James, Ian Barry and Billy Lane, Kimura was among the first custom bike builders to receive an invitation to the Legend Of The Motorcycle - Concours d'Elegance exhibition.
In 2010, Kimura and Chabott Engineering were the subject of a documentary short by film maker Henrik Hansen, which was one of five documentaries to be nominated for a 2010 Vimeo documentary award.

Alyssa Healy

Alyssa Jean Healy (born 24 March 1990 on the Gold Coast, Queensland) is a cricketer who plays for New South Wales and the Australian women's team. She made her international debut in February 2010.
A right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, she is the daughter of Greg Healy, who was part of the Queensland squad, while her uncle Ian Healy was Australia's Test wicket-keeper and held the world record for the most Test dismissals. Healy first came to prominence in late 2006 when she became the first girl to play among boys in the private schools' competition in New South Wales. She moved up the state age group ranks and made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 2007–08 season. She played most of her first two seasons as a specialist batsman due to the presence of Leonie Coleman—a wicket-keeper for Australia—in the state side. Coleman left New South Wales at the start of the 2009–10 season and Healy took up the glovework on a full-time basis for her state. During the same season, she recorded her highest score of 89 not out at faster than a run a ball, and made the most dismissals of any wicket-keeper in the Women's National Cricket League.
Following the injury to Australian captain and wicket-keeper Jodie Fields, Healy was given her international debut in the 2010 Rose Bowl series against New Zealand. She played in the first five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and five Twenty20 (T20) internationals, but was dropped for the last three ODIs during the New Zealand leg of the series. Healy played in every match of the 2010 World Twenty20 as Australia won the tournament after an unbeaten campaign.
Healy is also the partner of Mitchell Starc, a fast bowler in the Australian men's cricket team.
Early years.
Healy is the daughter of Greg, who was a member of the Queensland squad, while Greg's younger brother Ian was Australia's Test wicket-keeper from the late 1980s until 1999 and was the world record holder for the most Test dismissals. Another uncle, Ken, played for Queensland. Despite the family heritage, and watching her uncle represent Australia, she said that she did not become interested in cricket until she moved from Queensland to Sydney as a child and was coaxed into taking up the sport by a friend.
Her selection at the age of 16 in late 2006 as wicket-keeper for Barker College First XI, the first time a girl had been picked to play among boys in the elite private schools' cricket competition in New South Wales, drew press commentary from various sources. This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled "Save Barker Cricket Now" in the school community attacking the selection as a "disgrace" and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team. The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as "gutless" and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit. Ian Healy and Alex Blackwell, a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author. The emailer was also criticised, and Alyssa Healy commended, by social commentators in newspapers. In 2010, she reflected "I'd do it all again...I really enjoyed playing school cricket with the boys and it definitely helped lift my skills and tighten my technique." Both she and Australian team-mate Ellyse Perry have publicly advocated girls playing against boys.
In January 2007, Healy was selected in the New South Wales team to play in the Under-19 interstate competition. Opening the batting in all three matches and keeping in only the second of these, she scored 47, 73 and 41 in her first three three matches, and took one catch. She went on to end with 345 runs at a batting average of 57.50, topping the run-scorers list and was named the best under-17 player at the tournament. The following month, she was selected in the Australia Youth team, composed of under-23 cricketers, to play against New Zealand A, the only player selected before making their senior domestic debut. She scored 10 not out, 41 and 63 in three matches, and made one stumping. Her 63 from 84 balls in the final match was the top-score for the Australians, but it was not enough to prevent a 22-run defeat. She played as a wicket-keeper batting in the middle-order in the first match, and opened in the last two matches, playing purely as a batsman. The series ended 1–1 after the second match was tied.
Senior domestic debut.
At the start of the 2007–08 season, she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian domestic one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as Leonie Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to being with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the run rate, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.
New South Wales reached the final and were awarded the title because they placed first in the qualifying matches after rain washed out the deciding game. Healy ended the season with 78 runs at 11.14. She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches. She scored two and made a stumping in the first match, and neither batted nor kept wicket in the latter. New South Wales prevailed in both.
At the end of the season, she was selected for the Under-23 Australian team to play a series against the senior England and Australian teams. She scored 45, 1 and 41 not out in three matches. In the third match, she combined for a second-wicket partnership of 52 with Elyse Villani, hitting six boundaries in 62 balls and guiding her team to an eight-wicket win over the Australian team. Playing as a specialist batsman, she also took three catches. The new 2008–09 season started the same way, with the Under-23 national team playing against Australia and India. The first match, against India, was washed out and Healy made a duck and 9 in the other matches. Playing as a batsman, she did not take a catch.
Healy again played as a batsman, with Coleman ensconced behind the stumps. In the first four matches of the new domestic season, she batted only once, scoring nine. In these matches she was placed in the lower-order and did not bowl. She was dropped after these four matches.
She then played six matches for the Second XI in the space of a week, mostly as a top-order batsman, sometimes opening and as a wicket-keeper. New South Wales won all the fixtures except for one that was abandoned due to inclement weather. She scored 120 runs at 40.00, took six catches and made three stumpings, and was recalled to the senior team after one week in the second-string outfit. In her first three matches back, Healy was placed in the middle-order and not required to bat or keep wickets. In the last league match, she scored 59 from 55 balls in an 89-run partnership at faster than a run a ball with Lisa Sthalekar against Victoria. New South Wales won by three wickets despite losing Healy and three subsequent batsmen in the closing phase of the run-chase. In the final against the same team the following week, Healy made 11 from 22 balls before being run out, but New South Wales nevertheless won by six wickets with more than 15 overs to spare to claim the title. Healy ended the one-day competition with 79 runs at 26.33. She was named Australia's 30-strong shortlist for the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, but was not a part of the final squad of 15.
Healy also played in two Twenty20 matches for her state during the season, scoring 35 from 27 balls against South Australia and 16 from 21 balls against Victoria. She was New South Wales' second top-scorer in both matches; the first was won but the second lost.
Full-time wicket-keeper.
After the Women's World Cup held in early 2009, Coleman transferred to play for the Australian Capital Territory, so Healy became New South Wales' gloveman on a full-time basis for the start of the 2009–10 season. After making scores of 11, 12 and 29 in her first three innings of the one-day season, she struck an unbeaten 89 against Victoria. Coming in upon the fall of Leah Poulton with the score at 1/9 after three overs, she hit 13 fours in 82 balls, putting on partnerships of 72 with Blackwell and 82 with Sthalekar. New South Wales reached their target of 187 with more than 13 overs to spare and Healy was named the Player of the Match, having earlier taken a catch and made a stumping. Her season was interrupted by her selection in the Australian Under-21 team to play against the New Zealand Emerging Players. In five matches, she scored 50 runs at 10.00, took five catches and made one stumping as Australia won the series 4–1.
In the final of the one-day competition, she scored 23 from 37 balls batting at No. 3 and took two catches as New South Wales defeated Victoria by 59 runs. Healy ended her first full season as a wicket-keeper with 208 runs at 29.71, the second-highest average in her team behind Blackwell. In 11 matches, she also took 11 catches and completed 9 stumpings, effecting more dismissals than any other player.
She made 52 runs at 13.00 in seven T20 matches. Her best score was an unbeaten 20 from 13 balls in an eight-wicket win over Tasmania. In the final, Victoria batted first and made 5/127, Healy completing a catch and stumping. In reply, Healy made a duck as New South Wales lost four wickets in the first 13 balls and were all out for 75 to lose by 22 runs.
International debut.
Healy was selected in the Australian squad for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand in February 2010 due to an injury to the incumbent wicketkeeper and captain Jodie Fields. The selection committee released a statement saying "Alyssa has been identified for higher honours for a number of years and now gets the chance to display her wicket-keeping skills and attacking batting on the international stage". Healy made her ODI debut at the Adelaide Oval and played in all five ODIs in the Australian leg of the series. In her first match, she scored 21 from 11 balls in the death overs, hitting four fours as Australia made 241 before bowling out the visitors for 126 to seal a 115-run win. She took one catch, removing Amy Satterthwaite from the bowling of Rene Farrell. Healy made consecutive ducks in the next two matches, and made four in the final match at Junction Oval. She had only brief opportunities with the bat in the closing stages of the innings. She ended the series with 25 runs at 6.25 and a strike rate of 100.00, five catches and a stumping.
She then played in the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams, and was the first match to be shown live on free-to-air television in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler Ellyse Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first ball of the match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it. Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar's off spin. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 at the end of the 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final ball of the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.
Healy had little impact with the bat in the three T20s in Australia and two more at the start of the New Zealand leg of the series, scoring 17 runs at 5.66 and a strike rate of 77.27. Apart from one catch on her debut, she did not make any more dismissals. Australia lost all five matches. She was then omitted for the three ODIs in New Zealand as batsman Jess Cameron stood in as a makeshift wicket-keeper.
2010 World Twenty20.
Healy was selected for the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and played in every match after Fields was again forced out by injury. In the first warm-up match, she took two catches and did not bat as Australia lost to New Zealand by 18 runs. In the last warm-up match, she was again not required to bat and did not make a dismissal as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs.
Australia were grouped with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were struggling when Healy came to the crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen in the space of 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.
A Super Over eventuated, and Laura Marsh bowled for England. Healy came in at 1/3 after Leah Poulton fell on the fourth ball. She hit a two from the fifth ball, and was run out by Jenny Gunn while attempting to complete a second run on the sixth and final ball of Australia's Super Over, leaving them at 2/6. England also ended with 2/6 after a run out in an attempt to secure the winning run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match—Jess Cameron scored the solitary six.
In the next match against South Africa, Healy was elevated two positions to No. 7. Coming in upon the fall of Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal was part of a sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Deandra Dottin from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet.
Australia went on to face India in the semi-final. Healy stumped leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj from the bowling of Sthalekar and was not required to bat as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven balls to spare. Australia elected to bat first in the final against New Zealand, but was top-order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5/51 in the 13th over after the fall of two wickets in quick succession. The pair lifted the run rate by adding 21 runs in 18 balls. Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield. This left the score at 6/72 in the 16th over, and Australia eventually ended on 8/106.
During the middle of the run-chase, Priest was incorrectly given out stumped by Healy after the television umpire Asad Rauf had pressed the wrong button, and he had to retract his decision. Soon after New Zealand were at 5/36 after 11 overs, leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls, and Australia were in the ascendancy. However, New Zealand's chances were revived by Nicola Browne and Sophie Devine, who put on 41 from as many balls. In the 18th over, Healy caught Browne from Perry's bowling, and Australia went on to win by three runs after New Zealand ended on 6/103.

Pacific Ocean Fire

Pacific Ocean Fire are a folk rock group from Leicester, England, who have released five albums. Their music is generally considered alternative or Americana.
History.

Their third album, "From the Station to the Church We are Under the Same Stars", was released on Sorted Records, the title referring to the way it was recorded:
"We recorded half of the album in a room above Leicester train station. The other half was recorded and mixed at Dave’s home, he lived on a road with “church” in the street name . We spent so much time between those places late at night that became it".
After previously playing the Musician Stage of the Summer Sundae festival, they performed on the main stage in 2007, also performing at the Truck Festival and the dumduckerdum Music Festival, then going on to tour the UK with Josh T Pearson. The band's fourth album, "Strangers and Deranged Patients" was released in November 2007 on the American Azra label. It was followed by a US tour in 2008.
The band split in September 2009 after performing their farewell gig at Camden Dingwalls supporting Drugstore following an invitation to play from Isabel Monteiro. Their final album, "Hibernation songs", written amidst and largely about very personal tragedies for songwriter Jon Bennett, namely the dissolution of his marriage and the death of his father was released on Azra Records in July 2010.

Reviews.
"Pacific Ocean Fire are our unexpected treat sounding a bit like an English Bright Eyes circa Lifted " – Drowned in Sound
“ These eleven songs are a beautiful collection of wistful, poetic 2am music, the sort of stuff you probably have to be alone and in a reflective mood to appreciate properly. It's low-key and often lovelorn, and every song on the album stands up in its own right – there simply isn't any filler ” – Twisted Ear 4.5 / 5
“ Like Thin White Rope circa 'The Ruby Sea' transplanted to an obscure UK seaside town, this is one of those rare occasions where a record is so strong you’re pretty much spoiled for choice in terms of trying to single our favourites “ – Whisperin & Hollerin 9 /10
“ If the songs were visual, they’d be a couple waltzing alone under the spattered light of a nicotine-stained mirror ball. They all share a sort of ragged, sentimental glory “ – Americana UK 8/10
"Glorious, luminous, ragged , backporch songs as if they’d been raised under western skies with little more than coyote howls for company “

Bogota bag

A Bogota bag is a sterile plastic bag used for closure of abdominal wounds. It is generally a sterilized, 3 litre genitourinary irrigation bag that is sewn to the skin or fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. Its use was first described by Oswaldo Borraez while a resident in Bogota, Colombia.
Temporary abdominal closure techniques are used to postpone definite closure until predisposing factors causing pathologic elevation of intra abdominal pressure are resolved. These techniques include the Bogota bag, absorbable mesh, vacuum pack dressings, the Wittmann patch or velcro burr and the KCI VAC or Abthera dressings.
These temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra abdominal pressure to restore system perfusion. 
Regardless of the technique used, they are characterized by a tension free closure. In addition, the Bogota bag acts as a hermetic barrier that avoids evisceration and loss of fluids. Another advantage to the Bogota bag, is that the abdominal contents can be visually inspected which is particularly useful in cases of ischemic bowel. 
The bogota bag can be used in cases of 'burst abdomen' following laparotomies, especially those using a midline horizontal incision. Burst abdomen is usually characterized by a serosanguinous pink discharge from the wound, 6–8 days after surgery
One alternative to the Bogota bag temporarity abdominal closure is the artificial burr temporary abdominal closure (a.k.a. Wittmann Patch. The artificial burr closure adds continuous tension on the fascial edges as a benefit to those of the Bogota bag.

French colonial administration of Laos

The French approach to the colonial administration of Laos might be viewed as one of 'benign neglect', as compared to the contributions of other colonial rulers to their Southeast Asian colonies.
French Territorial Administration.
The French had originally divided central Laos into two administrative districts, Upper Laos and Lower Laos. In 1899, both districts were integrated into a single administration. 
In 1904 and 1905, Laos was deprived of the southern plateaus, previously part of its territory. Under the Convention of 13 February 1904 that modified the 3 October 1893 Treaty that concluded the Franco-Siamese War, French Laos gained control of the right-bank section of Luang Phrabang and part of the right-bank territory of Champasak from Siamese King Rama V.
Subsequently, the French reestablished Laos as a political entity in the middle Mekong Valley, extending from southern China to the Khong falls on the Cambodian border. Detachment of the left-bank territorial administration from Annam was based on budgetary necessity in the new French Indochina.
Through their colonial administration of Laos, the French had sponsored the notion of modern nationhood amongst the disparate Lao territories, primarily in an attempt to remove the Lao people from the cultural orbit of neighbouring Siam, which the French suspected to be increasingly aspired of creating a 'Greater Siam' made up of all Tai-speaking territories.
French Civil Administration.
The colonial government was staffed by several hundred French civil servants at any given time, headed by a "Résident supérieur" based in Vientiane. The "résident supérieur" had direct authority over the provincial" résidents", who were on an equal status with the Lao" chao khoueng" (provincial governors). The "résident supérieur" also acted as ambassador of the French state to the king of Luang Prabang and supervised the kingdom’s administration through provincial commissioners. The affairs of the kingdom were managed by a four-member council headed by the viceroy. Whilst the royal court in Luang Prabang continued to manage its own affairs, the day-to-day running of the territories was entrusted largely to French, Vietnamese and Laotian civil servants in Vientiane, subordinate to the "résident supérieur".
Nature of French colonial Laos.
Laos hence became a low-key French protectorate, where an indolent lifestyle prevailed. It was too mountainous for plantations, there was little in the way of mining, and the Mekong was unsuitable for commercial navigation. The French built very few roads – the main colonial route constructed was from Luang Prabang through Vientiane to Savannakhet and the Cambodian frontier. The French built no higher-education facilities; some half-hearted attempts were made to cultivate rubber and coffee, but the main export under the French was opium. Only a few hundred French resided in Laos. They adopted a dissolute lifestyle with Laotian or Annamite consorts, and left the administration to Vietnamese civil servants. The king was allowed to remain in Luang Prabang, trade was left to the resident Vietnamese and Chinese, and the Laotians carried on farming as they had for hundreds of years.
Assessment.
During the colonial period, administration, health care and education hardly made significant impact or progress at all. Given that there was no industry to speak of and agriculture was barely self-sufficient, there was little money for infrastructural development such as roads, schools and hospitals. The only prominent change for the Laotian people was the repression of the indigenous trade and the more onerous presence of tax collectors, which were a frequent cause of revolts. In the lowlands, uprisings were harshly repressed, but in the highlands of Xieng Khuang and Bolovens Plateaus, the French found it difficult to deploy their heavy weaponry. At times, a remission of taxes led to pacification of such revolts. The only real growth brought about by the French colonial administration was the monopoly of opium sales, an industry that is still dominant in the Laotian economy.

Sterling SAR-87

The Sterling SAR-87 was a military assault rifle of the late Twentieth century. The Sterling Assault Rifle (SAR), which included elements from Sterling's earlier Light Automatic Rifle (LAR) design, was jointly engineered by Sterling Armaments Company and Chartered Industries of Singapore in the early 1980s as an advanced version of the AR-18 for the export sales. It was also introduced to the British Armed Forces, who refused it because they were already in the process of adopting the SA80 manufactured by Royal Ordnance Factories. The SAR-87 was a robust weapon based on the well tried AR-18 with the versatility of the M16 rifle. It could also be converted from 5.56x45mm to 9x19mm Parabellum by changing the barrel and bolt assembly, to provide a submachine gun for Police forces. Once again, Sterling Armaments tried to push the rifle, renamed SAR-87, for some more years, but at the end of the 1980s, it was bought out by British Aerospace/Royal Ordnance and closed. Less than 100 SAR-87 rifles were manufactured.

Guilty! (album)

Guilty! (called Black & White Blues in re-releases) is a 1971 album by Eric Burdon and Jimmy Witherspoon. It was the first release by Burdon after he left his band War.
History.
In September 1970, Jimi Hendrix died after a jam session with Eric Burdon & War at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. After that, Burdon often broke down on stage. On 5 February 1971 he finally left the band in the middle of their European tour, allegedly due to exhaustion. After returning home and taking time off, the bulk of the album was recorded in summer with Witherspoon. The backing band, called Tovarish, consisted mainly of members from War.
"Going Down Slow" was recorded live in May 1971 in the San Quentin State Prison, with backing from Ike White and the San Quentin Prison Band. "Home Dream" was taken from Eric Burdon & War's back catalog; the song's title refers to the John Phillips Studios in Los Angeles. "Soledad" was released as a single.
The album was re-released as "Black & White Blues" in 1976. Remastered CD issues, also with the alternate album title, were made in 1995 by MCA and in 2003 by BMG.
The Italian e-zine "Viceversa" ranked "Guilty!" number 97 on their top 100 albums of all time.

K. R. Vijaya

K. R. Vijaya is an Indian actress who has starred in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films. She started her career in the 1960s. She has been acting for more than four decades now in South Indian cinema. K. R. Vijaya has worked with almost all the stalwarts of South Indian cinema and has played a variety of roles.
Early life.
Vijaya was born on 30 November 1938. She spent most of her childhood in the holy city of Palani. Vijaya's father was from Andhra Pradesh and mother from Kerala. Her father wanted her to become an actress since he was himself acting in M. K. Radha's drama troupe at the time. K.R.Vijaya's sister K.R.Savithri and K.R.Vatsala are also popular among audiences. K.R.Savithri's daughter Anusha and Swati have also been actresses in many films. During her childhood in Palani, she met a palmist who viewed her palm and immediately told her that one day she will be at the top of stardom.She told the palmist that she didn't believe that. However, the palmist's prophecy came true in her life. K.R. Vijaya spent her childhood in Palani at a time poverty was rampant, and her family too could hardly make both ends meet.
Career.
Vijaya played the title character, a heroine, in her 1963 debut film "Karpagam", directed by K. S. Gopalakrishnan. Gopalakrishnan also directed her 100th film "Nadhiyil Muthu".
Vijaya has starred in almost 400 films in all the South Indian languages, including 100 films each in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu, half-a-dozen in Kannada, and one in Hindi titled "Oonche Log" (1965). Her co-stars in the Hindi movie were Raaj Kumar and Feroz Khan. She received many offers in Hindi, but did not accept them as she was busy in the South. 
Some of her critically acclaimed films include "Karpagam", "Selvam", "Anarkali", "Saraswathi Sabadham", "Nenchirukkum Varai", "Namma Veetu Theivam" (the movie in which she first started depicting deities), "Dheergasumangali" (she first started playing a mother in this film), "Idhayakamalam", "Thangappathakkam","Panchavarna Kili" and "Thirusoolam".
Filmography.
K. R. Vijaya has starred in many films. Her first film was "Karpagam" in 1963, where she portrayed the title role, Karpagam. The movie went well and she was also praised for her role. Apart from films, she has also starred in two teleserials, "Raja Rajeswari" and "Kudumbam", shown both in India and Sri Lanka.

Grapefruit (book)

Grapefruit is an artist's book written by Yoko Ono, originally published in 1964. It has become famous as an early example of conceptual art, containing a series of "event scores" that replace the physical work of art – the traditional stock-in-trade of artists – with instructions that an individual may, or may not, wish to enact.
Origins of the event score.
Event scores were developed by a number of artists attending John Cage's Experimental Music Composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York. Whilst Ono did not attend these informal lessons, her husband at the time, Ichiyanagi Toshi (an experimental musician), did and Toshi and Ono became regulars of Cage's circle of friends by 1959. Other members of this group included David Tudor, Morton Feldman, Richard Maxfield and Merce Cunningham. Invention of the event score is usually credited to George Brecht, but La Monte Young and Yoko Ono are also cited as amongst the first to experiment with the form. Both Cage and Brecht were deeply influenced by "Oriental thinking", and Ono found that her Buddhist-inspired work was, almost accidentally, fêted by the emerging New York counterculture as avant-garde.
Origins of the book.
Often considered a Fluxus artwork, in fact the work was originally published by Ono's own imprint, Wunternaum Press, in Tokyo in an edition of 500. After leaving New York in 1962 – where she had exhibited at Maciunas' AG Gallery, amongst others – her then-husband Anthony Cox suggested she collect her scores together. George Maciunas, the central personality in Fluxus, had apparently been trying to reach her in Tokyo with the aim of printing a similar book in New York, as part of his series of "Fluxkits" (see "Water Yam"), but his letters had not reached her; she sent some of the scores and a prepublication advertisement to be published in his Fluxus newspaper in February 1964 when contact was finally established.
First edition.
The name "Grapefruit" was chosen as title because Ono believed the grapefruit to be a hybrid of an orange and a lemon, and thus a reflection of herself as "a spiritual hybrid". It also seems likely that it is a playful allusion to Brecht's "Water Yam", itself a pun on Brecht and Watt's "Yam Festival", which, culminating in a series of events and performances in May 1963, had been derived from "May" backwards.
The first edition that was published in 1964 in Japan by Wunternaum Press created by Yoko Ono, contains over 150 "instruction works"; virtually all are in English, with about a third translated into Japanese. They are divided into five sections; "Music", "Painting", "Event", "Poetry" and "Object". The instructions are preceded by dedications to figures including John Cage, La Monte Young, Nam June Paik, Isamu Noguchi and Peggy Guggenheim, and also includes documentation relating to Ono's recent exhibitions and performances. The work was originally sold for $3.00 before publication, $6.00 after.

Subsequent editions.
The second edition was published in 1970 by Simon and Schuster in New York, Peter Owen Ltd in London, and Bärmeier & Nikel in Frankfurt. As well as an introduction by John Lennon ("Hi! My name is John Lennon. I'd like you to meet Yoko Ono..." In the 2000 reissue of Lennon's book, In His Own Write, Ono wrote a similar introduction), the work contained 80 more instruction pieces, and included two more sections, "Film" and "Dance". The book ends with a collection of Ono's writings including "To The Wesleyan People", 1966. There were also paperback versions printed by Sphere and Touchstone around the same time, and a reprint by Simon & Schuster in 2000. The sphere edition has a particularly memorable sleeve, conflating the title with Yoko Ono's film "Bottoms", (or no. 4), a film composed exclusively of naked bottoms, made in 1966.

William Plenderleath

William Charles Plenderleath (2 June 1831 – 1 April 1906) was an English Anglican clergyman, author and antiquarian, best remembered for his "White Horses of the West of England" (1885, 2nd edition 1892).
Life.
Born at Clifton, Bristol, Plenderleath was the only son of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Plenderleath, of 27, Richmond Terrace, Clifton. Colonel Plenderleath was a half-pay officer of the 49th Regiment of Foot. He had been commissioned into the 89th Regiment of Foot on 29 May 1796, served in the War of 1812, was decorated after the Battle of Crysler's Farm of 1813, and was a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).
Plenderleath was educated at Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire and at Wadham College, Oxford, graduating BA and MA, and entered the ministry of the Church of England. He was Rector of Cherhill, Wiltshire, from December 1860 to April 1891, and then of Mamhead in Devon from 1891 until 1905, dying on 1 April 1906.
While he was at Cherhill, Plenderleath's interest in the Cherhill White Horse led him to write a paper, "On the White Horses of Wiltshire and Its Neighbourhood" (1872) for the "Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine", followed some years later by a book, "White Horses of the West of England" (1885). He also kept a notebook of Cherhill's affairs which was first published in 2001, ninety-five years after the author's death, as "Plenderleath's Memoranda of Cherhill". He intended this as a record of "what an English country village was in the 19th century, as portrayed by one who had the best opportunities of knowing".
At Mamhead, from 1891, Plenderleath also kept notes of his parish, described as "Includes census details (official and unofficial), offertory accounts, list of communions, collections in aid of voluntary church rate, and confirmations. In the front is a linen-backed map showing inhabited houses in Mamhead".
Family.
The 1881 census for The Rectory, Cherhill, gives a snapshot of Plenderleath's household. His wife, Margaret E.J. , was aged forty-four and had been born in the West Indies. Margaret Edith Plenderleath (unmarried, age 24, born Bedminster, Gloucestershire), and Maud Mary Plenderleath (unmarried aged 2?, born Clifton, Gloucestershire) were their daughters. Five domestic servants are also recorded, a cook, a footman, a lady's maid, and two housemaids.
On 20 April 1881, at Cherhill, Plenderleath's daughter Maud Mary Le Fevre Plenderleath married George Bayntun Starky (1858–1926) of Spye Park House, Bromham, Wiltshire, later of Brackenfield Station, Amberley, New Zealand, and they had six sons:

Y Gaer

Y Gaer () is a Roman fort situated near modern-day Brecon in Mid Wales, United Kingdom.
Y Gaer is located at (Landranger 160).
History.
Y Gaer was built around AD 75 and sits on a crossroads of Roman roads in the valley of the River Usk at a strategic point in Roman Wales, linking South Wales and Mid Wales. It was part of a chain of similar forts, such as Gobannium at Abergavenny, a days march away down the Usk valley, and larger bases, such as Moridunum (Carmarthen) via Alabum (Llandovery), Cardiff Roman Fort to the south and Isca Augusta, Caerleon, the main base for the Roman legion locally.
The site was excavated in the 1920s by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, a prominent archaeologist of his day.
The fort was built for a contingent of up to 500 cavalrymen, recruited originally in Spain from the Vettones, and these Vettonian cavalry would have played a significant part in the conquest of the area held by the Silures.
Their early stables were wooden and their accommodation basic, protected by clay banks topped with a wooden palisade. This was rebuilt in the 2nd century AD by the Legio II Augusta and also shows signs of being repaired again in the 4th century.
Y Gaer Today.
The site is in the care of Cadw. It lies on private farmland and Cadw provides no signposting to the site, which lies on the further side of the farm buildings at the end of the approach lane.
Visitors can see remnants of stone walls standing in parts to some in height, part of three gatehouses and corner guard towers. Several artifacts have been removed to local museums, such as a tombstone of a young cavalryman called Candidus, held at Brecknock Museum in Brecon.

Cosna River (Alaska)

The Cosna River is a tributary of the Tanana River in the central part of the U.S. state of Alaska. It flows northward from the Bitzshtini Mountains into the Tanana west (downstream) of Manley Hot Springs.
In 1899, Lieutenant J. S. Herron attributed the name to the Tanana peoples living in the area. However, a century later linguist William Bright, citing the "Koyukon Athabascan Dictionary", attributed the name to the Koyukon words "kk' os", schist rock, combined with "no, river.

Anton Abele

Anton Amadé Abele (born January 10, 1992) is an Swedish activist, debater and politician. He is a Member of Parliament for Stockholm County, replacing incumbent Minister for Culture and Sports Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth, since the 2010 general election. At the age of 18, he is the youngest person ever to become a Member of Parliament in Sweden. 
He entered the political scene as an anti-violence activist following the death of 16-year-old Riccardo Campogiani, who was beaten to death at a party in the centre of Stockholm in October 2007.
On July 25, 2013 Abele announced that he will finish his term in the Swedish Parliament, then end his political career and not run for re-election in the 2014 general election, citing disillusionment with the working climate in the Parliament. 
Achievements.
Abele received the human rights award "Free Your Mind" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich in November 2007. In January 2008, two major Swedish newspapers independently awarded Abele their "2007 Stockholmer of the Year" prize. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden acknowledged Abele's initiatives in his televised Christmas speech on December 25, 2007. In the same speech the King also said that "Nobody can do everything, but everybody can do something". In May 2008, Abele and his Swedish campaign "Stop Street Violence" received the "2008 Most Important Communication Effort" award. 
Anton Abele has held a number of speeches and presentations. The Council of Europe invited Anton Abele to participate in the conference "Building a Europe For and With Children-Towards a Strategy for 2009-2011" in Stockholm, and to hold the speech "Children Changing Societies" on September 8, 2008. On April 30, 2008, Abele held the traditional Spring Speech at Skansen, Stockholm. The theme for the speech was "Change". At the demonstration against street violence in October 2007, Abele gave a speech to over 10,000 people, who had gathered in Stockholm to show their disgust against violence. Anton Abele is frequently invited to speak at various events. These events most often have the escalating violence and actions against it as the topic. 
As a result of this initiative, triggered mainly by young people to young people, the topic of escalating violence and insecurity among young people has been lifted to governmental level.
Non-profit organisation & activism.
Abele created a Swedish Facebook group called "Bevara oss från gatuvåldet" (Save us from street violence). In one week, the group grew to having more than 100,000 members. In addition, on October 12, 2007, Anton Abele arranged the demonstration "Stop street violence" with more than 10,000 young people and adults participating in Stockholm. Simultaneously with the massive demonstration in Stockholm, anti-violence demonstrations were also held in other major cities in the Nordic region. 
Abele founded a non-profit organisation called Stoppa Gatuvåldet ("Stop Street Violence"), which now operates several projects against violence. The main focus of the group, is to increase the understanding of the medical and legal consequences of violence mainly among young people. The group also works with ethical issues and works toward changing attitudes. The group, which is politically and religiously independent, has both young people and adults as members. On February 10, 2008, the group organised a conference "Stop Street Violence" bringing together over 1,000 young people and adults in the Stockholm City Hall.
MP career.
On October 14, 2010 Abele became the youngest ever Member of the Swedish Parliament when he was chosen from the top of the Moderate party MP short list. On 25 July 2013 Abele announced that he will finish his term and not run for re-election in the 2014 elections, citing disillusionment with the working climate at the Riksdag.

Bujang Lapok

"Bujang Lapok" (The Three Worn-Out Bachelors) is the first comedy film directed and acted by P.Ramlee. They were later followed by:
Plot.
This film is about the lives of three bachelors and best friends Ramli, Aziz and Sudin ('bujang' means 'bachelor'). The three of them share a rented room in a house owned by a wealthy and beautiful widow, Cik Normah. Unlike most other landlords, she is a kind and friendly woman who helps them out wherever and whenever she can and who also secretly harbours affection for Ramli. 
Amongst the three of them, Sudin is the only one in a relationship - with their neighbour, Zaiton. She lives next door and is the daughter of a wealthy family whose mother is very prejudiced against middle class people such as Sudin. Fearing objection, Zaiton and Sudin have to always sneak around to meet each other with their main form of communication being bottles as a calling instrument. Their other less prominent hurdle is Zaiton's precocious younger sister, Ayu, who knows about Sudin and Zaiton and is always blackmailing them. The next morning, a potential love for Aziz, Sapiah, comes to the house. She is there to seek help from Cik Normah who is infuriated by the lack of responsibility by Sapiah's father who has, once again, failed to care for her. The initial sombre atmosphere is quickly uplifted with the arrival of Sudin's mother who has come for a visit. Her unexpected appearance sets off a series of hilarious turns surrounding around Ramli, who was still sleeping (without his top on) in the room but is eventually woken up with a prank by Aziz. 
As they all go about their day, Ramli encounters another failed romantic pursuit whilst Zaiton's and Sudin's love affair is finally revealed, enraging Zaiton's mother into a confrontation with Sudin's mother. Whilst they all convene to discuss the best way to deal with the situation, they realise Aziz is missing. He finally appears with unpleasant news in the form of Sapiah who had encountered an assailant earlier during the evening. Aziz comes to her rescue and as he tries to get further help from Cik Normah, Sapiah's father appears at the house in a rage and hurts both Aziz and Sudin but is eventually subdued by Ramli.
Sudin's and Zaiton's situation is finally resolved with the promise of a hefty dowry from Sudin's mother. He almost gets into trouble at work when he comes in late the next morning and is contacted by Ramli who was at a cafe with a woman he had just met. Sudin teases him that Cik Normah will be hurt if she discovers him dating another woman but Ramli assures Sudin that he is not the one she is interested in. After they hang up, Ramli discovers he has been duped by the woman he had just met and was whining to himself when he spots another woman whom had scammed him at another time and place. He trails her, perhaps hoping to confront her when he was confronted by her poor living conditions. He was then saddened by the awful truth of the great lengths people in poverty have to go through for some comfort. The serious undertone is once again cheered up with a song by Zaiton in the next scene who is naturally relieved and happy that things have resolved for her and Sudin. Aziz tries to take a step further with Sapiah who mistakes his intention for a less than honourable one and upon persuasion from Cik Normah, Sapiah finally reveals all the events that had happened to her the night she was rescued by Aziz. On a closing note, her father appears seeking her forgiveness but chooses not to take him home with her as he feels Cik Normah is a better guardian for Sapiah than he is. He also asks both Aziz and Sudin to forgive him for what he had done to them and as soon as Sudin concludes with him, he is faced with his weeping mother who has failed to come up with the dowry she had promised.
When Ramli returns, he sees all of them gathering together with sombre sad looks on their faces. When he finds out what had happened, he immediately springs into action. Zaiton was persuaded to retrieve the expensive diamond ring her mother has and they exchange it for a duplicate one from the pawn shop. The money gained was then used for the dowry and wedding expenses for not just Sudin and Zaiton but for both Aziz and Sapiah too. On the wedding day, Ramli gets caught in another unfortunate romantic entanglement and is rescued by Cik Normah who finally reveals to him her true feelings for him.
Trivial.
The films inspired the 2007 animation Budak Lapok.

Arthur A. Goldberg

Arthur Abba Goldberg (born 1940) is an American businessman and leader in the ex-gay movement. He is co-founder and co-director of Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH) and president of Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality (PATH).
Education.
He received his B.A. majoring in Government, with a minor in English from American University with general honors, and a J.D. from Cornell University where he wrote for the "Cornell Law Review" and was also the editor of the Cornell Law Forum from 1964 to 1965. He was a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law and Deputy Attorney General of New Jersey. He was licensed to practice law in both New Jersey and Connecticut.
Views on homosexuality.
While attending New York University, Goldberg's son and the son of Elaine Berk both came out as gay. Goldberg and Berk found that much of the ex-gay movement was strongly associated with charismatic Christianity. Wanting a spiritual alternative for same-sex attracted Jews, they co-founded Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH). In the 1960s, Goldberg traveled to the American South, and now "employs the language of civil rights to argue that people should have the right to change their sexuality." 
Goldberg "uses Jewish law texts and scientific study to get to the individual root causes of same sex attraction and help those who are unhappy with their lifestyle reassert their gender identity and change their life." In 2008, he wrote "Light in the Closet: Torah, Homosexuality, and the Power to Change". In the book, Goldberg claims that there is no genetic cause of homosexuality, and argues that homosexual orientation can be changed through reparative therapy.
Business activities and conviction for fraud.
In the 1980s, Goldberg was well known on Wall Street, earning the nicknames "Abba Dabba Do" and "Abba Cadabra" for his investment skills. 
As Executive Vice President and a major stockholder of Matthews & Wright Inc., a Wall Street investment bank, he orchestrated a massive fraud from 1984 to 1986 in which the firm sold over $2 billion of fraudulent municipal bonds to several cities. The victims were mostly impoverished communities with large minority populations—such as the territory of Guam; East St. Louis, Illinois; East Chicago Heights, Illinois; Chester, Pennsylvania and Sac and Fox Reservation in Oklahoma. Goldberg and his associate, Frederick Mann, netted $11 million in unlawful profits from the scheme.
"The Philadelphia Inquirer" exposed the scam in a series of articles in 1987. In December 1987, a federal grand jury in Guam indicted Goldberg and Mann on 52 counts of bribery, conspiracy and fraud. Soon afterward, federal authorities were forced to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California; so many of Guam's residents had been defrauded that it would have been impossible to empanel a jury. He was indicted on separate charges in Illinois soon afterward.
Facing the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison, in July 1989 Goldberg pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles federal court to three counts of mail fraud. Later that month, he pleaded guilty in an East St. Louis federal court to one count of conspiracy to defraud. In October 1989, Goldberg was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and five years' probation. He was also fined $400,000 (later reduced to $100,000 on appeal). In a separate action, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned Goldberg from the securities industry for life and ordered Matthews & Wright to permanently close its doors.
Activism.
Since the 1960s, Goldberg has been involved in community service and was active in resettling immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. In 1974, he founded the Committee for the Absorption of Soviet Emigres in Jersey City.

Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder

"Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder (subtitled The Life and Crimes of Gilles de Rais") is the eighth studio album by English extreme metal band Cradle of Filth. It was released on 27 October 2008, through Roadrunner Records.
It is Cradle of Filth's first album as a four-piece, rather than its usual six-man staple. It is also the last album to feature backing vocalist Sarah Jezebel Deva (although she briefly returned for "Midnight in the Labyrinth") and the first to feature drummer Martin Škaroupka, replacing Adrian Erlandsson. Once again, Doug Bradley provides narration for the album (as with "Midian", "Nymphetamine" and "Thornography"). The title of the album derives from a valediction vocalist Dani Filth once used to sign a letter.
A special edition containing a bonus disc was also released. The album peaked at number 48 on the "Billboard" Top 200 chart, with sales of a little over 11,000 copies.
Recording and production.
The album is produced by Sabbat guitarist Andy Sneap, who previously worked with Cradle of Filth while mixing the band's 2006 album, "Thornography".
The band's official message boards recently revealed parts of an interview with guitarist Paul Allender, conducted by MédiaMatinQuébec: "We already have four new songs ready and I have to say that they are... much faster than the songs on "Thornography". sound like old Cradle of Filth... A mixture of "Midian" and "Dusk..."." The interview goes on to state that the album will be followed by a European and American tour. Dani Filth has described the album as, "our most extreme, dramatic and deeply disturbing album to date. The legend of Gilles de Rais has been given fresh, vampyrical life in this conceptual meisterwerk, swathed in pitch-black magic and a viciousness unsurpassed in the annals of Cradle history. Screw what our detractors say, everyone who has heard this album has bruised their jaws on the pentagram-bejewelled floor."
In an interview with "Blistering" magazine, Filth revealed that three additional songs were recorded during the album sessions, among them an instrumental piece and a cover of Celtic Frost's "Into the Crypts of Rays". On the topic of their absence from the album, Filth has stated that they "were taken out so that the album wasn't too long. They'll turn up somewhere." They were ultimately included on the special edition.
Concept.
In an interview published in February 2009, Dani talked about Gilles de Rais, and how his story manifests on "Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder":
Promotion.
The track "Tragic Kingdom", was made available for free download by Roadrunner Records on 27 August 2008. 30-second samples of each track on the album were made available on amazon.de on 27 September.
The track "Honey and Sulphur" was the album's first single, and has been made available for purchase on the iTunes Store. A music video for the song was filmed at the Chislehurst Caves of Kent. In addition, "Midnight Shadows Crawl to Darken Counsel with Life" is available for streaming on the band's official website. A video for "The Death of Love" was released on 31 July 2009. Andy Sneap has mixed a new version of the song for the video.

Ria Thielsch

Ria Thielsch (born in Manokwari, New Guinea/Indonesia, on August 25, 1951) is an Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) entertainer. She was a model and a member of the girl group Luv' in 1980 and 1981. She was officially introduced to the public with the release of the album Forever Yours (a LP which reached the gold status in the Netherlands) and the single My Number One (a Top 5 single in Benelux).
Early years.
Ria Thielsch started her career as a model in the 1970s. In 1978, she was a limbo dancer and singer of the Ricardo & The Flames group which recorded a single (Trinidad) that was produced by Roy Beltman (who collaborated with the band BZN) and flopped.
Luv'.
In August 1980, after a couple of years of mainstream success, the pop trio Luv' experienced trouble as Patty Brard suddenly left the formation. Hans van Hemert and Piet Souer, the group's producers, had already written new material for a next album. The girls had legal obligations. Brard's departure caused InterLUV' (Luv's limited company) to lose an estimated $75.000 as many performances were cancelled. Patty was replaced by Ria Thielsch who like her had Indonesian and New Guinean origins. Ria knew Marga Scheide, the blonde singer of Luv', from modeling agencies. She was selected from 200 applicants. Though she made some appearances by performing One More Little Kissie on stage and on TV, she was officially presented to the media when the album Forever Yours and the single My Number One came out. These records were smash hits in Benelux. Then, Luv' was supposed to take part in the Yamaha Music Festival (officially known as the "World Popular Song Festival" and considered as the "Oriental Eurovision") in November 1980 with the song Be My Lover Tonight. Instead of it, Luv' cancelled their participation to this competition and performed in the Musikladen TV show in Germany.<br>
Soon after, Marga Scheide became overworked because Luv' toured extensively Europe. That's why, in early 1981 the ladies stopped their concerts but continued the TV and radio performances. In March, an official statement announced Luv's break-up. The group made a farewell performance later, on July 22, 1981, on the Nederland Muziekland show on Veronica (TV channel) to promote the single Tingalingaling. Finally, CNR/Carrere Records released the compilation Goodbye Luv'.

Rolf Wenkhaus

Rolf Wenkhaus (9 September 1917 – 31 January 1942) was a German child actor who is most likely recalled for his role of Emil Tischbein in the 1931 film "Emil and the Detectives".
Early life.
Born in Berlin, Germany, Rolf Wenkhaus was the son of actor Kurt Wenkhaus. He made his film debut at age 14 in 1931 as a child actor in the role of Emil in the Gerhard Lamprecht-directed adventure film "Emil and the Detectives" () for Universum Film AG. The film was based on Erich Kästner's 1929 novel "Emil and the Detectives", and proved to be commercially successful. 
"S.A.-Mann Brand".
In 1933 he appeared in one of the Third Reich's first propaganda films "S.A.-Mann Brand" as Erich Lohner, a juvenile member of the Hitler Youth who selflessly sacrifices himself at film's end to save a comrade. Like many Nazi propaganda films of the period, "S.A.-Mann Brand" was banned from viewing for many years following World War II.
Death.
After the outbreak of World War II, Wenkhaus enlisted in the military. At the time of his death he was in the aircrew of a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor, a four-engine bomber that specialized in attacks on shipping. Wenkhaus’s plane, with identification code F8 MH 0093, was shot down January 31, 1942, off the coast of Bloody Foreland in County Donegal, Ireland by the HMS Genista, a Flower class corvette being utilized as a convoy escort vessel. The entire aircrew of six was killed. The body of the pilot, Werner Bornefeld, washed up at Bunbeg two weeks later, and was eventually reburied at a German War Cemetery at Glencree, Ireland.

Nile (TV series)

Nile is a 2004 BBC Television documentary that tells the history and natural history of the Nile.
Production.
The series was produced by the BBC Natural History Unit in co-production with the Discovery Channel.
Episode three includes footage from the 1971 BBC Television mini-series "The Search for the Nile".
Reception.
Reviews.
"The Times" calls it an, "enlightening BBC series," that, "uses stunning photography and restrained dramatisations to pay homage to the longest river on Earth."
The reviewer concludes, "never mind the cardboard dramatisations — this is an heroic story."
Episodes.
Episode one: "Crocodiles and Kings".
Since the dawn of history the miraculous annual floodwaters have risen to transform the desert into a fertile paradise where the great civilisation of Ancient Egypt grew, but their existence was on a knife-edge held hostage by the river and the Pharaoh maintained the balance by appeasing the gods to ensure the gifts of the river. 
The New Kingdom of Rameses and Tutankhamun began 3,500 years ago with the province of Thebes at its heart, and farmers, fishermen and temple builders thrive with the blessings of the rivers. At dawn Hamadryas Baboon climb to the top of the temples to great the sun god Ra who rides across the sky in his chariot, a sharp-eyed Peregrine Falcon bursts from the sun as a manifestation of the all-seeing Horus, and a feared Cobra hunts in the fields it’s poisonous venom manifesting the suns burning rays. The scarab beetle embodies the sun’s daily journey, born from the ground it sculpts a sphere of dung to feed its young which emerge again in perfect continuity, while a Nile catfish feeling its way with long whiskers guides the sun back to the east for its rebirth. 
The Old Kingdom of the Pyramids had been destroyed by a 20-year drought that starved much of the population; now as the waters dry up the people turn for protection to the Pharaoh who is the son of Osiris. Osiris taught the people cultivation but was murdered by his brother Seth and scattered across the land only to re-emerge as a symbol of fertility while Seth was banished to the desert from where he threatens to return with famine and death. Female Hippos, fighting to defend their young, are worshipped as Tort; Crocodiles, welcoming the heat that maintains their body temperature, are worshipped as Sobek; and flocks of sacred Ibis, signalling the arrival of the flood, are worshipped as Thoth. The land is transformed into a flooded plain while the Pharaoh oversees the construction of dams and channels to tame the floods.
The receding waters leave behind thick fertile silt from which frogs and toads are born as symbols of the land’s resurrection. The farmers sow their seeds as memorial to Osiris who in reborn again in the harvest crops only to be devoured by a swarm of locusts that poison whatever is left with their droppings. Wild dogs and jackals, scavenging the overflowing cemeteries, are worshipped as Anubis. The pharaoh death leaves the country in chaos as the body is mummified with a scarab amulet placed on the heart. As the drought approaches, with no Pharaoh to intercede with the gods, Egyptian Vultures flock over the river as a symbol of death. The Pharaoh, buried with precious provisions for his final journey, enters the "Hall of Judgment" where his heart is weighed against a feather by the gods.
The Pharaoh is found worthy earning his place among the gods and the Nile rises again to revitalise the valley and sustain a civilisation that would inspire all those that followed.
Episode two: "The Great Flood".
The annual flooding of the Nile brought the water and fertile volcanic soil that made the Ancient Egyptian civilisation possible, but impassable rapids made it impossible for them to discover the source of this bounty they attributed to the gods. The river stretches into Sudan through a forbidding desert known as the "Belly of Stones" that was home to the "Black Pharaohs" of the Nubian kingdom of Kush who once ruled over their Egyptian neighbours. The Blue and White Niles merge in the "Longest Kiss in History" at the crossroad city of Khartoum. 
The White Nile flows through the impenetrable swamps of the Sudd where shifting islands of papyrus buoyed by air-sacks in the steams long prevented further exploration. White-Eared Kob form one of Earth’s greatest concentrations of large animals as they graze the neighbouring grasslands during the dry season. The native Dinka cowherds rely on their cattle for a diet of milk and blood supplemented only by fish when possible. The Dinka and Cob are forced on the move as rains swell the swamp, bursting its banks and doubling its size. A Lungfish emerges from its cocoon of mud and mucus and uses its primitive lungs to breathe air while it reaches for the nearest pool only to be caught in the oversized beak of the giant Shoebill stalk, while family groups of Speckle-throated otter and the powerful Nile monitor also hunt the waters. The Dinka and Cob return and a stranded catfish crawls to safety as the waters evaporate in the sun but this is not the source of the Great Flood.
The Blue Nile flows through dry savannah from a deep barren gorge on the fringe of the Ethiopian highlands where the Lammergeier vulture seeks out those who succumb to the drought. A volcanic plug that rose up 30 million years ago has left the region with Africa’s highest mountains, where the Hippos of Lake Tana live in the continent's highest body of water. The dry highland dome above is home to Earth’s highest density of rodents and the Egyptian Wolf which digs them up. The indigenous Gelada baboons feed exclusively on grass using their massive teeth only for the intimidation of rivals. Moisture-laden clouds from the Congo basin bring annual rains to "Africa’s Water Tower" that transforms the rodent’s world with lush vegetation for food and cover from predators like the Auger Buzzard. Night time freezing breaks up the topsoil of one of the oldest areas of cultivated land in Africa and it is washed downstream to the lake where Pelicans gather to feed and Weaver birds build papyrus nests. The Christian highland farmers beg the pagan river spirit Guion for mercy at times of great flood. 
Ancient Egyptians had heard rumours of Lake Tana but had no idea how important the Blue Nile that flows over the "Smoking Fire Falls" with its fertile volcanic soil was to their civilisation.
Episode three: "The Search for the Source".
From the heart of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea runs the world’s longest river. Since the Egyptians first settled along its banks men have dreamt of discovering where the Nile was born, but for centuries the river kept its secrets close. The obsession grew and by the mid-19th century some were prepared to risk their lives to be the first to discover the source of the Nile. 
Nomads first settled along the banks of the Nile around 5000 BC and replenished by annual floodwaters grew into the Ancient Egyptian civilisation but the source of the miraculous waters remained a mystery to them. 
The Royal Geographic Society dispatched Richard Burton and John Speke to Lake Tanganyika to find the source in 1857 but unable to complete their mission Speke separated from the main party and discovered Lake Victoria. The vast lake retains water like a vast reservoir with evaporations drained back by surrounding mountains. Speke returned with James Grant a year later and discovered the outlet at Ripon Falls. The new moon rains trigger the emergence of vast breeding swarms of flies that plagued the expedition. Speke and Grant headed downstream from the outlet but were forced to take refuge at Gondokoro. Here they met with Samuel Baker and his wife who had travelled up stream in search of the source and discovered Lake Albert in 1864.
The newspaper reporter H.M. Stanley was sent to Africa in 1871 to find Dr. Livingstone who had vanished five years earlier exploring Lake Tanganyika. Together they searched unsuccessfully for the outflow till the time came for Stanley to return home. Following Livinstone’s death Stanley returned in 1874 to map all three lakes but was prevented from completing his work by warring tribes. He returned in 1881 and discovered Lake Edward that he concluded creates a vast reservoir system with the other lakes that feeds the Nile. The Mountains of the Moon between the humid forest of the Congo basin and the monsoon lands of East Africa attract rains which, regulated by the forests of mosses, liverworts, ferns and lichens, trickle down into Lakes Albert, Edward and George to feed the Nile. 
Tectonic movements created a vast plateau in East Africa 10-15 million years ago and the Mountains of the Moon 12 million years ago. The East African Rift fractured along the flank of the plateau collecting water into Lakes Albert, Edward and George 8 million years ago and the plateau depressed filling into Lake Victoria less than 1 million years ago. Lake Victoria, swelled by the wet climate phase at the end of the last ice age, broke its banks 12,500 years ago and flowed into Lake Albert creating a new river that cut north into the flatlands of Sudan where it joined by the sediment filled Blue Nile before following into the Egyptian dessert where it gave birth to a civilisation 7,000 years later.

Mamhead

Mamhead is a rural village and civil parish near Dawlish and Kenton in Devon, South West England, in the Teignbridge local authority area.
On high ground on the Haldon Hills, dense woodlands open out into views of the coast and the estuary of the River Exe.
History.
The village was part of Exminster hundred.
According to Daniel and Samuel Lysons, in their "Magna Britannia": 
John Marius Wilson's "Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales" (1870–1872) says of Mamhead: 
The population was 230 in 1801, 178 in 1901. A parish history file is kept at Dawlish Library.
Mamhead Park.
The Mamhead estate dates from Domesday, when it was held by Ralph de Pomerai and later by Sir Hugh Peverell. In the early 14th century, Sir Nicholas Carew became lord of the manor through his marriage to Amicia de Peverell, and Mamhead remained with the Carews until 1547.
The Mamhead estate was sold by the adventurer Sir Peter Carew (1514–1575) to Giles Ball, whose son Sir Peter Ball (1598–1680) was attorney-general to King Charles I's Queen, Henrietta Maria. He began to build a country house here, replacing an older house. His grandson Thomas Ball (1671–1749), a merchant, planted many exotic trees brought back from his travels. Between 1742 and 1745, he built an obelisk on the hill above the house "out of a regard to the safety of such as might use to sail out of the Port of Exon or any others who might be driven on the coast". The obelisk has a height of one hundred feet.
Mamhead then passed into the hands of the Earls of Lisburne.
In 1823, Mamhead was bought by Robert William Newman (1776–1848), who completely rebuilt the house on a new site in 1827-1833, to the designs of Anthony Salvin. In 1833, Westley Farm was also rebuilt by Salvin. Newman was Member of Parliament for Exeter from 1818 to 1826 and High Sheriff of Devon in 1827. On 17 March 1836, he became Sir Robert William Newman, 1st Baronet, of Mamhead in the County of Devon. The third Baronet was High Sheriff of Devon in 1871. The fourth Baronet represented Exeter in the House of Commons from 1918 to 1931, when he was created Baron Mamhead of Exeter in the County of Devon, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The peerage became extinct on his death in 1945, but the baronetcy is still extant.
As of 2012, the estate is for sale. 
Parish church.
The Church of England parish church, dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle, stands in Mamhead Park and is a mostly 15th century building. The chancel was rebuilt about 1830 by Robert William Newman, and the south transept was turned into the Mamhead pew.
Rectors.
The Rector of the village from 1766 to 1777 was William Johnson Temple, who is mentioned several times in Boswell's "Life of Johnson". He was the grandfather of Frederick Temple (1821–1902), Bishop of Exeter and Archbishop of Canterbury. Temple and Boswell had been undergraduates together at the University of Edinburgh, and Boswell visited Mamhead just after Easter, 1775. Temple was a water-drinker, and under his influence Boswell made a vow under the branches of the great churchyard yew at Mamhead (which can still be seen) never to get drunk again.
William Plenderleath (1831–1906) was Rector of Mamhead from 1891 until 1905, and kept notes of the parish, described as "census details (official and unofficial), offertory accounts, list of communions, collections in aid of voluntary church rate, and confirmations. In the front is a linen-backed map showing inhabited houses in Mamhead".

Alderville First Nation is a band of Mississaugas, a sub-nation of the Ojibwas. The Alderville and Sugar Island 37A reserves belong to that First Nation.
First Nation.
The Alderville First Nation is an Anishinaabe First Nation located in southern Ontario, Canada. As of September 2008, Alderville First Nation had 1007 registered band members, of which their on-Reserve population was only 313 people, meaning the majority of their registered population live outside the reserve (off-reserve) in neighbouring communities.
Governance.
The community is governed by an elected Chief and Council, and maintains political affiliations with the Ogemawahj Tribal Council, a non-political Regional Chiefs' Council, and the Union of Ontario Indians (Anishinabek Nation), a Tribal Political Organization. 
As of 22 July 2013, the members of the Chief and Council are:
Indian reserve.
The First Nation have reserved for themselves two areas. Their main reserve, the Alderville First Nation (formerly designated as Indian Reserve 37 by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), is located near the south shores of Rice Lake in Ontario (). It consists of 3 non-contiguous areas within the Alnwick/Haldimand Township approximately north of Cobourg, and occupies a total area of . They also maintain a smaller parcel of land on nearby Sugar Island, the Sugar Island 37A Indian Reserve (). It has been home to the Mississauga division of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) Nation since the mid-1830s.
Prior to its current location, the people of the community had lived in their traditional lands around the Bay of Quinte - located approximately east of its current location. However, with the influx of refugee settlements following the American Revolution, the community found itself under increased pressure. Having lost its American colonies, the British were forced to relocate the soldiers and civilians loyal to the crown (also known as the United Empire Loyalists) around the Bay of Quinte area. The area is now home to the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte First Nation (also known as Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory), the land having been promised to Joseph Brant, leader of the Mohawks that were loyal to the British Monarchy.

Duarte Square

History.
In the late 1600s, the plot was a farm owned by Trinity Church. The square in its current form was officially dedicated in 1945 in concert with the renaming of Sixth Avenue to the Avenue of the Americas "in celebration of Pan-American unity". In 1975 benches, trees and sidewalks were added to the square. On May 26, 1977, control of the square was transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In 1978, the Consulate of the Dominican Republic dedicated a statue of Juan Pablo Duarte in the square. The dedication took place on the 165th birthday of Duarte, who was one of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic. Italian sculptor Nicola Arrighini designed the thirteen-foot bronze figure, which today rests atop an eight-foot granite base. This statue is one of a group of six other monuments to Latin American leaders throughout the Avenue of the Americas.
LentSpace.
To the immediate west of Duarte Square, across a one-block stretch of Sullivan Street that is now closed to traffic, is a plot also known as Duarte Square. This plot is owned primarily by Trinity Wall Street (a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of New York), and is fenced off and leased for a non-profit arts program known as LentSpace. This plot was targeted by the Occupy Wall Street organization as a new campsite. On December 17, 2011, after demonstrating in Duarte Park and marching on the streets surrounding the park, occupiers climbed over and under the fence. Police responded by arresting about 50 demonstrators, including at least one Episcopal bishop.

Severian Encratites

The Severians were a sect of gnostic Encratites. Epiphanius supposes their leader Severus to have preceded Tatian (founder of Encratites) but Eusebius, Theodoret, and Jerome make him Tatian's successor. These latter authorities are followed by most ecclesiastical historians, and the silence of Irenaeus and Hippolytus regarding Severus renders the later date most probable. 
Ephiphanius ascribes to the Severians a belief in the well known Gnostic power Ialdaboth (Yaldabaoth) who appears in the Ophite system as the first offspring of Bythus and Ennoia. The Severians held that Ialdaboth was a great ruler of the powers, that from him sprung the Devil: that the Devil being cast down to the earth in the form of the serpent produced the vine, whose snake-like tendrils indicate its origin: that the Devil also created woman and the lower half of man.

Gichang

The Gichang is a Korean weapon which is first described in the Muyesinbo, a Korean martial arts manual published in 1759. It later also found its way into the Muyedobotongji (1791). 
The weapon is, basically, a spear with a flag attached to the pole. The "gichang" is also called "danchang" (단창), which means 'short spear'. It would typically be around 2.75 metres long. The blade measured about 23 centimetres in length. These spears were generally used for ceremonial or escort purposes. 
Another chapter in the "Muyedobotongji" is also called "gichang" (騎槍), but deals with techniques for using the spear from the back of a horse. The hanja is different though.

Fisher Building.
The Fisher Building is a 30-story office building designed by Albert Kahn. It was built in 1928, constructed promarily of limestone, granite, and marble. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 29, 1989, has been nicknamed "Detroit's largest art object." The building was to house the automotive company Fisher Body of the Fisher brothers (Frederick, Charles, William, Lawrence, Edward, Alfred and Howard), and is widely considered Kahn's greatest achievement. The year of its construction, the Fisher building was honored by the Architectural League of New York as the year's most beautiful commercial structure. The opulent three-story barrel vaulted lobby is constructed with 40 different kinds of marble, decorated by Hungarian artist Géza Maróti, and is highly regarded by architects.
New Center Building.
The New Center Building was also designed by Kahn and built by the Fishers). The ten-story building is architecturally similar to the Fisher Building, and the two are connected by an underground tunnel. The building was originally designed to house office and retail space, but as of 2004 houses only offices, including those of Albert Kahn and Associates. The building was renamed the Albert Kahn Building in 1988.
Significance.
The Fisher Building was built in 1927-1928; the New Center Building followed in 1930-31. The two buildings are the only structures built by the Fishers in the New Center; although more buildings wer planned, the Great Depression and World War II intervened.). However, the Fisher and New Center Buildings as a pair are an architecturally significant complex demonstrating some of the finest craftsmanship and artistry in Art Deco style buildings. The two buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1980; the Fisher Building was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 29, 1989.

St Mary's Church, Pyrton

St Mary's Church, Pyrton, is the Church of England parish church of Pyrton, Oxfordshire, England. Its parish is part of the benefice of Icknield, in the deanery of Aston and Cuddesdon, the archdeaconry of Oxford and the diocese of Oxford. The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.
History.
An early Anglo Saxon Chronicle Charter mentions the presence of a church at Pyrton by 887. In about 1115 it was granted to an Augustinian foundation of canons at Runcorn, Cheshire, by William fitz Nigel, who was Lord of Pyrton and also the second Baron Halton. In 1134 the community of canons was moved to the nearby village of Norton and the church remained in the possession of Norton Priory until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. The rectory and advowson were then granted to Christ Church, Oxford. In 1943 the parish was united with that of Shirburn. The united parish is now part of the benefice of Icknield.
The present church building dates from the 12th century with a porch added in the 15th century. The nave and chancel were largely rebuilt in 1854 by J. C. Buckler, who preserved the basic lines of the former church and retained some of the original features. The nave was lengthened by at the west end to provide seating for an additional 120 people. In 1929 additional heating was installed and in 1939 electric lighting was added and the organ replaced a harmonium in 1953.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church is built in knapped and coursed flint with ashlar limestone dressings and a gabled tile roof. Its plan consists of a chancel with vestry, a three-bay nave with a south porch and a bell-cote at the west end. The remaining Norman features are the south doorway, the chancel arch and the internal part of window in the north wall of the nave. A similar window in the south wall of the nave is a Victorian copy. The east window has three lights, the chancel has 12th-century lancet windows and in the vestry are round-arched 19th-century windows. At the west end is a two-light window flanked with buttresses. The bell-cote has trefoil-headed lancet windows above two cinquefoil-headed bell openings.
Interior.
The pews, lectern and stained glass date from the 19th century; the glass in one of the nave windows erected in 1893 was made by Clayton and Bell. In the south porch are medieval tiles of six different designs. The oak pulpit is dated 1636. The wooden parish chest was acquired in 1638. The font dates from the 12th century and has a mid-19th century cover. The church contains a number of memorials, the oldest of which is a slab of Purbeck marble in front of the altar in memory of a priest. It dates from around 1340 and formerly had an inscription in brass letters. The monuments in the nave are mostly to members of the Hamersley family; one of these is a brass tablet dated 1929 which was designed by Eric Gill. The ring consists of three bells; two of these are dated 1605 and 1606, the other was given in 1953 to replace a bell dated 1593. The parish registers date from 1568 and there are churchwardens' accounts from between 1548 and 1882.
External features.
Two chest tombs in the churchyard dating from the 18th century are listed at Grade II.

Urdesa

Urdesa is a neighborhood in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador.
History.
The name Urdesa comes from "Urbanización del Salado" which means neighborhood by the estuary. The quarter was born as an urbanism project north to the city for the middle and upper class around 1956. The neighborhood lies on the estuary side and soon began with the construction of mansions with beautiful gardens and no fences. The German School Guayaquil opened its doors on 1958, as the first school on the neighborhood. Nevertheless the school resettled in 1968 in the new neighborhood Los Ceibos. But by then, URDESA had already other educational institutions. 
On the 1990s all villas got a garden fence for security reasons. With time, not only mansions where constructed, but smaller middle class houses as well and Urdesa lost its high society status. 
The new part of the quarter is named North Urdesa. It has smaller streets and affordable houses for the middle class. In the 1980s it was rapidly densely populated and by the 1990s it already reached the 6th Avenue where it merged with Urdenor, a project for the lower middle class, until the Juan Tanca Marengo Avenue. 
The quarter grew over the years and today it is the north downtown with many retail stores, restaurants, bars and traffic. Also the crime rate has risen and many of the old neighbors have moved away to newer urbanism projects like Samborondón for the high class, Los Ceibos for the upper and middle class.
The Neighborhood.
Although on 1950s it was the geographical north of the city and even on the city's border, now it is the geographical center due to the exorbitant growing of Guayaquil. What is historically considered as the city center would actually be the geographical east. For this reason, Urdesa has become very transited and the main route to go from the residential Los Ceibos and all the neighborhoods around it to go downtown or to Samborondón. 
The main street is the Victor Emilio Estrada Avenue. On the street are many banks, restaurants, retail stores, bars, liqueur stores and office buildings.
Very characteristic to this quarter is that the streets on the quarter's center are alphabetical named after native trees: Acacia, Bálsamos (Myroxylon pereirae), Cedar, Date Palm, Ebony, Ficus, Guayacán, Fig, Ilanes, Jiguas, Laurel and Myrtle.
Today, Urdesa has been profoundly renovated by the city government. The main streets have been cobblestoned and the sidewalks were designed by a garden architect with beautiful trees and flowers. In spite of the commercial activity on the main streets, the mayor has successfully achieved that the side streets remain a residential area. Therefore visual contamination (baners) are prohibited on the side streets, where the quarter is exclusively residential. 
In 1997 the then-mayor León Febres-Cordero achieved what seemed impossible, namely getting the owners of the proprieties to renew their home fronts, specially the fences, because they were virtually on the public sidewalk leaving merely few centimeters for pedestrians to walk. After initial problems with the proprietors, who complained about high costs for removing only a meter or even a few centimeters, the then-mayor announced that if they didn't do it on themselves, the city hall personnel would do it by force. That scared most of the home owners and today, all of them have constructed new fences and there's finally enough sidewalks in order for pedestrians to walk.

7th Cavalry (film)

7th Cavalry is a 1956 American Western film directed by Joseph H. Lewis based on a story, "A Horse for Mrs. Custer," by Glendon Swarthout set after the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Filmed in Mexico, the picture stars Randolph Scott and Barbara Hale.
Plot.
Captain Tom Benson (Randolph Scott) has been granted a furlough to bring his bride-to-be Martha back to Fort Abraham Lincoln and his Regiment, the 7th Cavalry. Benson is mystified when he sees the fort apparently deserted with the colors not flying. Exploring the vacant post he is met by the hysterical Charlotte Reynolds (Jeanette Nolan) whose husband replaced Benson as commander of his "C" Company and was killed at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Only a small group of misfits and guardhouse prisoners led by an old sergeant remain who have held a wake by drinking themselves into oblivion.
Once the commands of Major Marcus Reno (Frank Wilcox) and Captain Frederick Benteen (Michael Pate) have returned, they and the widows hold Benson in contempt, not only for not being at the battle in command of his men, but what they perceived as George Custer's liking for him, Benson's non-West Point background, and his career as a gambler until commissioned into the Regiment.
Martha's father Colonel Kellogg (Russell Hicks) comes to the post to conduct a Board of Inquiry into Custer's actions that Benson sees as a smear against a man he admires who can not defend himself.
Held in contempt by his Regiment, when the President of the United States orders the recovery of the slain officers and the burial of the cavalrymen who fell in the battle, Benson takes his misfits and military prisoners into Indian territory to perform the task.
The Indians have made the land sacred ground and do not want to see the enemies they respected taken away from their burial site. A standoff develops as the cavalry insist on leaving the battleground with the dead officers' bodies. As the situation becomes tense a cavalryman is shot dead with an arrow whilst trying to escape. Then Custer's horse appears, surprising everyone with the fact that it has survived the battle that killed its master. The bugler blows the call to charge and the horse gallops towards the cavalry's position. The Indians are said to believe that Custer's spirit has returned and allow the cavalry to leave the field.
Back at the camp Captain Benson is reconciled with his father-in-law.

Frank Cvitanovich

Frank Cvitanovich (14 August 1927 - 12 August 1995) was a Canadian documentary film maker, who made much of his best work for British television.
Early years.
Cvitanovich was born in Vancouver, the son of a Croat immigrant. His father founded his own salmon fishing fleet and young Frank worked for him as an apprentice, before trying his hand as a poker player, theatre hand, film runner and professional American footballer. A severe knee injury ended his gridiron career in California, but Cvitanovich convinced the makers of Gene Autry's ‘The Singing Cowboy’ TV show that he could direct. He made a further 31 episodes in Hollywood, before moving to London in the mid-fifties and setting up his own film company. In 1970 Cvitanovich was the co-director of Festival Express. A documentary account of a five-day Canadian rock tour, that took several influential bands across Canada by train, it was finally released with contemporary interview footage in 2003.
Thames Television.
Cvitanovich’s greatest work was for Thames Television during the 1970s, under the enlightened reign of Director of Programmes Jeremy Isaacs. His first film for Thames was "Bunny" (1972), a moving account of the treatment given to his own brain-damaged son in a Philadelphia clinic. The film won Cvitanovich an International Emmy. Frank loved sport and his very first documentary was a study of a baseball player in decline. For Thames he made films about motorcycle champion Barry Sheene, the footballing ‘Charlton Brothers’ and ‘Saturday’s Heroes’(1976) about life behind the scenes at Tottenham Hotspur F.C.. Other subjects included a day in the life of an East End park, and ‘The Kilnsey Show’ about a Yorkshire wall-building competition. Yorkshire was also the setting for "Bonny, Beauty, Daisy, Violet, Grace and Geoffrey Morton" (1974) Cvitanovich’s best loved film, and the winner of a BAFTA and several other awards.
Marriage & Child.
Cvitanovich was married five times. His wives included TV director Midge Mackenzie (mother of his only son Bunny) and the TV presenter and journalist Janet Street Porter.

<doc id="18502271" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18502271" title="Embouchure collapse">
Embouchure collapse

Embouchure collapse is a generic term used by woodwind and brass players to describe a variety of conditions which result in the inability of the embouchure to function. The embouchure is the purposeful arrangement of the facial muscles and lips to produce a sound on a wind or brass instrument. In brass playing, it involves vibration of the membrane area of the lips.
Embouchure collapse in its various forms and extremities generally results in difficulty in playing for extended periods (especially if playing loudly and/or in the high register) or a complete inability to play. The former applies mainly in less severe cases; the latter in the most severe cases.
This article focuses on embouchure collapse in brass players.
Causes.
There are a variety of causes for embouchure collapse, mainly focal dystonia or Embouchure Overuse Syndrome; also, the topic of mouthpiece pressure (whether or not excessive pressure is damaging to the embouchure) is hotly debated by brass players.
Focal dystonia.
Dystonia is a neurological disease affecting the brain's ability to fire neurons (which control muscle movement) correctly. Focal dystonia specifically affects one particular area of the body and is usually completely isolated, affecting only one activity. The disease basically renders the sufferer unable to control the muscles in the affected area.
The presence of this condition in a brass player's facial muscles results in an inability to form an embouchure because of the individual's loss of control over the relevant muscles. Because the condition is neurological, there is, in terms of brass playing at least, no effective cure. Treatments using botox have been pioneered to treat focal dystonia in other parts of the body; however, they have been found to be ineffective in treating embouchure collapse. This is possibly because botox causes the facial muscles to relax; and although this collapse lessens the uncontrollable twitching of the muscles, the newly relaxed status deprives the player of the lip flexibility needed to play a brass instrument. For most brass players, diagnosis with focal dystonia signals the end of their careers.
Embouchure overuse syndrome.
This is a far more common cause of embouchure collapse. As the name suggests, embouchure collapse may be caused by "overuse"—or in simple terms, playing "too much."
Most brass players at some time experience lip swelling (or "stiff lips"). When a player is forced to continue playing despite this, the resulting stress can cause a chain of injuries that lead to embouchure collapse.
Generally speaking, the best way of overcoming swollen lips is to refrain from playing, or to practice for a shorter period of time and with a good warm-up in the days following any period of extensive playing. When a player is deprived of the opportunity to recuperate after a period of extensive playing, the simple matter of swollen lips is not allowed to heal, and the player is forced to work harder to compensate for diminished lip strength. Eventually, the player's facial muscles may collapse under the strain of playing.
Mouthpiece pressure.
The subject of mouthpiece pressure is closely related to the issue of embouchure collapse/embouchure overuse.
It has long been argued that excessive mouthpiece pressure is a cause of embouchure problems and can be a factor in causing embouchure collapse. However, the pressure of the mouthpiece is not static during playing: it increases the higher in the register a player plays and the louder volume level. Also, a little mouthpiece pressure is essential to provide a seal between the player's embouchure and the instrument; without this, all the air would escape before entering the instrument and no sound would be emitted (brass instruments are dependent on an airflow to produce sound).
Embouchure collapse is far more common among trumpet and horn players. Both of these instruments have mouthpieces with a small circumference, and therefore the pressure is presumably greater, as the force of the mouthpiece on the face is more concentrated. This is in accordance with the principle of physics that pressure is the amount of force divided by the area on which the force is exerted.
As a result of a lack of scientific evidence (no scientific study into mouthpiece pressure as a cause of embouchure collapse has ever been done), the equally valid argument that all brass players can suffer embouchure collapse, and the subjective (not static) nature of mouthpiece pressure, knowledge of mouthpiece pressure as a cause of embouchure collapse is limited.
Diagnosis.
Embouchure collapse caused by focal dystonia can be diagnosed medically; embouchure collapse caused by embouchure overuse, however, is generally speaking not considered to be a specifically medical issue. A difficulty in diagnosis is that when a brass player describes the symptoms to a doctor or dentist (as is often the case), the medical practitioner does not fully understand what the patient means. This is because brass players learn their embouchure by "feel," and therefore words have a limited ability to describe embouchure problems, especially if the person listening to the description is not a brass player and has a limited knowledge of the embouchure.
Also, in less severe cases, the player may only be able to feel what is wrong while playing. Many players with an embouchure problem will, once they have realized that it is more than a simple case of tired lips, wish to refrain from playing. The fact that around 24 muscles are employed in forming a brass embouchure, and that each will change slightly as a player struggles to play when experiencing embouchure problems, mean that what players describe as being wrong will have not only worsened their condition when they play, but will be different each time they do so.
In the severest cases, the pain caused by embouchure overuse can be felt even when not playing; in some cases, other symptoms will manifest, such as loss of tissue and damaged nerves. This, however, occurs only in the rarest and most extreme circumstances and usually signals the end of the player's career.
Recovery.
As stated above, sufferes of focal dystonia have virtually no possibility or recovery from embouchure collapse. Sufferers of embouchure overuse, however, have been known to recover. The simplest way of doing so is to refrain from playing for an extended period of time, possibly years, before attempting to play again. The exact amount of time needed and whether or not the player will have to completely relearn the use of the embouchure is a largely subjective issue and depends on the individual.
Additional information.
Several books on the subject are available, including "Broken Embouchures" by Lucinda Lewis, a professional hornist, who has succeeded in helping other brass players with embouchure problems.

Samuel Nunez

Samuel Nunis (1668–1744) was a Portuguese physician and among the earliest Jews to settle in North America.
A few months after their February 1733 arrival from England, an epidemic began claiming the lives of the first 114 colonists of the infant American colony of Georgia. The first to die in April was the colony's only doctor.
Unexpectedly, the "William and Sarah," a second ship from London, landed in Savannah on July 11, carrying a middle-aged physician and 40 more Jewish passengers. Dr. Samuel Nunis (1668–1744) was allowed by the colony's founder, General James Edward Oglethorpe, to begin treating the ill. By the time the middle-aged Portuguese physician began his treatments and during the month of his arrival, around two dozen died. However, the death rate dwindled dramatically to only a few with the epidemic ending by the end of that year. Over the protests of the London Trustees who did not want Georgia to become "a Jewish colony," General Oglethorpe allowed the Jewish people to settle in Savannah.
They were the “largest group of Jews to land in North America in Colonial days.” As told by one of his seven children, daughter Zipra, to her great-grandson Mordecai Manuel Noah, Dr. Nunis and his family embarked on a dramatic escape from Lisbon to London in 1726 for religious freedom, fleeing the Portuguese Inquisition.
Background: The Spanish Inquisition and Marrano Jews.
Official, bloody persecutions in the year 1391 were the beginning of the destruction of Spanish Jews. Jews were faced with the bitter choice: forced conversion or execution. Many Jews chose to die for their faith; while others became "Christians" in name only, secretly practicing their Jewish faith. The number of those who had embraced Christianity, in order to escape death, was very large. They were called 'Marranos' (pigs) by the Christians and Crypto-Jews by historians. As the persecutions against the Jews increased, the number of Marranos grew.
The persecution was followed by the Inquisition which, ninety years later, was introduced as a means of finding and killing the converted Jews who still remained loyal to Judaism. The heads of the Catholic Church established a religious court, the Inquisition, where suspected Marranos were tortured to force them to confess their loyalty to their Jewish faith. All of their wealth would be confiscated, with a large reward to whoever had denounced them; and they would be burned alive publicly.
Nevertheless, the secret Jews showed wonderful tenacity and courage and continued to practice their faith in the cellars of their homes. They married only among themselves and remained faithful to the religion of their ancestors. When King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain united all Christians under their rule in 1492, they were persuaded by the Inquisition to drive the Jews out of their land. In 1492, the remaining Jews of Spain were driven out of the country and many of them went to Portugal where they were heavily taxed and generally treated abysmally. A few years later, they were driven out of Portugal or forcibly converted to Christianity.
The Marranos continued to lead their lives as before, and the Inquisition had its hands full for hundreds of years afterwards.
The Nunis Family Caught by the Inquisition.
Such a family was the Nunez family. For many generations, this family kept up its Jewish faith in secret, and some family members met a violent death at the hands of the Inquisition. (A Clara Nunis was burned in Seville, Spain, in 1632; and in the same year, Isabel and Helen Nunis also were condemned to death for loyalty to their Jewish faith.)
One branch of the family, living in Portugal, was among the most distinguished of noble families. Although it was a little more than 200 years after the Expulsion from Spain, this family secretly still observed the Jewish religion. Born in Portugal, Diogo Nunes Ribeiro (later known as Samuel Nunis) was the head of this family who became a great physician. He was appointed Court Physician to the King of Portugal and even served as the physician to the Grand Inquisitor, also a member of the Royal Family. In addition to his services to the Royal Family, all of the nobility considered it a privilege if he attended them.
Dr. Nunis was still quite a young man when he reached attained success in professional and social circles. His prominence naturally created jealousy among his competitors, and the Inquisition gave them an excellent opportunity of trying to get him into trouble.
Although on the surface, Dr. Nunis was as good a Catholic as any churchgoing Christian, the leaders of the Portuguese Inquisition took note of the warnings given to them by the doctor's enemies. They managed to smuggle an "agent" into the household of the Nunez family in the guise of a servant, so they would be informed of what went on within the family circle.
Eventually, the agent reported that the Nunis family definitely was practicing the Jewish religion in secret. Every Saturday, they all retreated to a synagogue in an underground part of their mansion on the Tagus River in Lisbon. There they threw off their pretense of being Christians and worshiped in true Jewish fashion.
Dr. Nunez, his mother Zipporah, his wife Gracia (later known as Rebecca); their three sons Joseph, Daniel and Moses; their three daughters Rachel, Esther and Zipra; and servant Shem Noah were apprehended by the "Familiars of the Inquisition" during a Passover Service, "while seeking the Lord according to their prohibited faith."
Thrown into jail, they were tortured repeatedly and soon would have perished except for the intervention of the Grand Inquisitor. The Catholic Ecclesiastical Council reluctantly agreed to release Dr. Nunez so that he could treat the Grand Inquisitor who was afflicted with a prostate obstruction of the bladder.
There was one condition, however, which marred the happiness of the Nunez family in their release from prison. Two officials of the Inquisition were to take up residence with the Nunez family to make sure they would not practice their Jewish faith. This imposition led Dr. Nunez to contrive a daring escape plan for himself and his family.
Escape to London.
Dr. Nunez hit upon a brilliant, bold idea. He arranged a Banquet and Ball to which he invited all of the important people of the city. His guests included many high-ranking officials.
One evening he was host to the captain of a British brigantine anchored in the Tagus River. When the party was in full swing, the captain invited the guests and the Nunez family (accompanied by their unsuspecting Inquisitor keepers) to visit his ship.
What the guests did not know was that a surprise awaited them. About an hour or so after they had boarded the ship, they suddenly became aware that they were moving! Yes, they were, in fact, sailing away from the shores of Portugal at full speed, heading for the friendlier shores of England. Dr. Nunez had every detail arranged with the help of his relatives, the Mendez family, one of whom married Zipra, one of the lovely daughters of Samuel and Rebecca Nunez. Dr. Nunez secretly had succeeded in selling part of his estates and possessions and had transferred the money to England through secret couriers. Thus, he had been able to enlist a British captain to bring his brigantine to the Tagus River on the night of the banquet for the surprise voyage to London in August 1726.
Once in London, Samuel and his sons underwent circumcision to identify themselves as Jewish. Diogo and Gracia remarried in a Jewish ceremony and changed their names to Samuel and Rebecca. Early in 1727, Rebecca gave birth to their seventh and last child, a son who died as an infant.
A few years later in 1733, the Nunez family was among several mainly Sephardic Jewish families from Portugal who left London for the colony of Georgia. Also joining them on the "William and Sarah" was a small group of Ashkenazi Jews with German origins.
London Jews had been contributing liberally to the Oglethorpe scheme, providing new homes for impoverished Christians in the new colony of Georgia. In 1732 there were 6,000 Sephardic Jews living in London having lived as Crypto-Jews, publicly practicing Roman Catholicism and secretly preserving their Jewish heritage, prior to their departure from Portugal. The Bevis Marks Synagogue, still a Sephardic Jewish congregation in London today, helped finance the trip of their congregants.
All but eight of the original 42 Jewish colonists to Georgia were among these Spanish/Portuguese Jews who had arrived in London seven years earlier. They chartered two boats and sent a total of 90 Jews to Savannah in one year. Sailing on the first of these boats was Dr. Nunez and some of his family. On their voyage, an infant died and the ship nearly wrecked off the North Carolina coast. They arrived in Savannah on July 11, 1733 - five months after General James Oglethorpe and his first 114 colonists. The other boat arrived on November 12, 1733, according to the "Sheftall Diaries," a primary source document with entries from Mordecai Sheftall, a German Jewish passenger on the "William and Sarah."
These Jewish colonists were "the largest group of Jews ever to sail on one vessel for North America in colonial times," wrote Jacob R. Marcus in his study of "The Colonial American Jew." They brought with them "a sefer Torah, with two cloaks, and a circumcision box, which were given to them by Mr. Lindo, a merchant in London, for the use of the congregation they intended to establish." Their first order of business was to establish Congregation Mickve Israel in Savannah, the third oldest Jewish congregation in America. They also established a Jewish cemetery on Bull Street on the northern end of downtown Savannah.
When Dr. Samuel Nunez arrived in Savannah, Georgia, there was an outbreak of yellow fever and many people were dying. After this ship landed, Captain Thomas Corain, one of General Oglethorpe’s aides, wrote, "Georgia will soon become a Jewish colony." Captain Corain feared that if this news leaked out, rich Christians would not support the colony and poor Christians would not settle there. The London Trustees urged Oglethorpe to remove them. They had no legal basis for this request as Georgia’s charter permitted all persons “liberty of conscience in the worship of God” except Catholics.
General Oglethorpe almost did not allow the Jewish immigrants to land. Dr. Nunez assured Oglethorpe that he was a doctor of infectious diseases and could help the colony. The Georgia colony had lost their doctor in April of that year, William Cox, and were much in need of a physician. Oglethorpe realized here was an opportunity for good help during this epidemic in Savannah, and he let the Jewish families remain. He also knew some of these Jews had a knowledge of agriculture acquired in Mediterranean lands. He wanted to use them as tools to create in Georgia a "Mediterranean colony of wine, olive oil, silk and indigo."
Dr. Nunez’s arrival was very timely as there was an uncontrolled epidemic of "bloody flux" and "malignant fever" raging. Of the original 114 settlers, three more had died in June after their doctor's passing in April followed by four more in early July prior to Dr. Nunez's arrival. Although ten more died during July, those numbers rapidly diminished to two in August, four in September and one each during the last three months of that year.
The formal remedies at his disposal were limited and soon exhausted, but Dr. Nunez's training in botany helped him make use of indigenous plants and with great success. He used laudanum (opium) to control the "bloody flux" and lemon extract to treat the scurvy which appeared in debilitated patients. He employed ipecacuanha (emetine) empirically without knowing that it had a specific action on the amoeba histolytica. With infusions of cinchona bark (quinine), Dr. Nunez treated the "malignant fevers" considered in the medical texts of the period to originate from the evil night miasmas of the marshes (malaria =mal aria= bad air). When his supply of chinchona bark was exhausted, Dr. Nunez used as substitutes the bark of white oak, red oak and dogwood. He used tartar emetic to produce vomiting in patients with food poisoning, jimson weed smoked in a pipe for asthma and sassafras root tea as a "purifier of blood."
The epidemic subsided, the colonists returned to their work, and Dr. Nunez at 65 built his home and settled his family. General Oglethorpe sent to the Trustees of the Colony a report of the help rendered by the first active practitioner of medicine in Georgia who also formed Georgia's first pharmacy. The Trustees instructed him not to give the Jews land grants, but Oglethorpe ignored them. One of Dr. Nunez's sons-in-law, Abraham De Lyon who was married to his daughter Esther, was experienced in "cultivating vines and making wine." Also a farmer who grew peas, grain and rice, De Lyon used his training as a viniculturist to raise "beautiful, almost transparent grapes" in Savannah from choice cuttings he brought with him from Portugal. He and the other colonists helped develop a tract as a Botanical Garden (Trustees Garden) near the southern end of Broad at Bay Streets near the Savannah River. They introduced to the colonists foreign plants with valuable medicinal properties and developed herbs which were native to Georgia.
Most of the Jewish able-bodied young men, needed in the militia. Oglethorpe appointed one, Benjamin Sheftall, a lieutenant in the militia.
Dr. Nunez and Rev. John Wesley.
Two years later, Dr. Nunez met John Wesley who arrived in Savannah with a commission from the Trustees, appointing him to the office of "priest of the Church Of England" to the Savannah mission. Rev. Wesley courted the society of this Sephardic Jew but had no illusions about the ease with which he could be converted to Christianity. Pastor Bolzius, the leader of the Salzburg Germans, and George Whitefield, another pioneer Methodist, had offered the Jews conversionist
literature, which had been vigorously rejected.
Rev. Wesley exhibited a great interest in Dr. Nunez’s medical practice and discussed with him the conduct and care of his patients. John Wesley, who became the founder of Methodism, wrote in his journal on April 4, 1737, "I began learning Spanish in order to converse with my Jewish parishioners, some of whom seem nearer the mind that was in Christ than many of those who call him Lord."
8 hours." In Georgia, he met John Regnier, who was a male nurse among the Moravians. He assisted Regnier with the first autopsy in Georgia. The two men listed among the causes of death as "a hematoma of the abdominal wall, among other things"! In Georgia, John Wesley became an active practitioner of bodily as well as spiritual healing among his parishioners. On his return to England a few years later, he organized the first free clinic "for the ill and ailing."
The London Trustees eventually showed their appreciation for Dr. Nunez by sending him "casks of wine and packets of drugs" to be used in treating the colonists. With "two barrels containing twenty-three deer skins, weight of Bears oil" and several parcels of "sea pod, make root, sassafras, china root, sumac, and contra-yerba," Dr. Nunez opened the first pharmacy in Georgia to compound his medications from imported and native-grown herbs.
When Spanish forces moved up the Georgia coast from Florida in 1740, Dr. Nunez and other Jewish-Portuguese settlers fled Savannah, fearing the Spanish Catholics would burn them at the stake for apostasy. Some of the refugees moved inland to Georgia’s wild interior, while others went to Charleston, South Carolina. Dr. Nunez and Zipra were among those who left for Charleston.
They soon moved to New York City where Zipra's husband, Rev. David Mendes Machado, was the religious leader of Shearith Israel Synagogue. Samuel Nunez died in New York City in 1744 at the age of 76.
Dr. Nunez's Descendants of Distinction.
His son Moses became a man of wealth and distinction and a member of Oglethorpe’s Masonic Lodge. Moses served as an Indian interpreter and an agent for the Georgia Revolutionary forces. In his will of October 14, 1785, Moses divided his property equally among his children born to his first wife Rebecca Abraham (a son Samuel) and to his second wife Mulatto Rose (sons James, Robert and Alexander and daughter Frances Galphin).
Through Zipra, Dr. Nunez's second great-grandson, Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy, was one of the highest ranking naval officers of the Civil War. He is credited with abolishing the practice of flogging in the U.S. Navy. Commodore Levy purchased Thomas Jefferson's home Monticello when it was a disgraceful eyesore, restored it and, through his heirs, transferred it to the U.S. Government. He is known to be the first private citizen to restore an historic American residence. The Jewish chapel at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis is named in Commodore Levy's honor.
Other distinguished descendants of Dr. Nunez include two more great-grandsons through his daughter Zipra. Considered the best known Jewish man in America during the first half of the nineteenth century, Mordecai Manuel Noah was a jurist, journalist, public servant, playwright and one of the founders of New York University. Major Raphael Jacob Moses, a highly regarded Confederate officer, later became chairman of the Georgia House Judiciary Committee. An attorney from Columbus, Georgia, he is credited with establishing Georgia’s world-renown peach industry.

Deungpae

The Deungpae is a shield made of wisteria and bamboo which was used by the military of the Joseon Dynasty. The earliest Korean description can be found in the Muyejebo. 
Use.
In the classic Korean martial art manuals the use of the deungpae is explained in combination with both the spear and the sword. Often a soldier would hold the deungpae and sword in the dominant hand, while holding a spear in his other hand. The spear would be thrown at the opponent, after which the soldier would attack with his sword.
A soldier with a nangseon would back up the soldier fighting with deungpae and sword. They would be part of a so-called Mandarin duck formation which was invented by the Chinese general Qi Jiguang and is described in his book titled Ji Xiao Xin Shu.
Shield specialists trained in how to advance and retreat but were not allowed to retreat in combat situation because their withdrawal would leave their whole squad exposed, leading to its possible collapse.

Richard "Rich" Wilkes (born 1966 in Princeton, New Jersey), attended El Camino High School in Oceanside, California, and is an American filmmaker. His work to date is generally noted for its rooting in contemporary music and youth culture.
As screenwriter.
Wilkes' major-studio debut was as screenwriter of the 1994 film "Airheads", starring Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler. The story revolves around a group of loser musicians called The Lone Rangers, who take a radio station hostage in order to get their song played on the radio. "Airheads" was directed by Michael Lehmann of "Heathers" fame, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. 
This was followed by a co-writer credit (alongside director James Melkonian) for the 1994 comedy The Stoned Age, set in the stoner subculture of Southern California during the 1970s, starring Michael Kopelow and Bradford Tatum.
The same writing/ directing team then collaborated with The Jerky Boys to create the 1995 production "The Jerky Boys", featuring the eponymous comedians (self-described as "low-lifes from Queens") as New York City youths who get into trouble with the Mafia when one of their prank calls leads them into a money laundering business.

David Meyler

David John Meyler (born 29 May 1989) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League side Hull City. He is the son of hurling manager John Meyler. He grew up in Rochestown Rise in Cork and, like his father, played hurling, Gaelic football and soccer from an early age. 
Club career.
Cork City.
He progressed through the youth team of Cork City and signed a professional contract in 2008. He made ten appearances for Cork in the League of Ireland at the age of nineteen. He made his debut in a cup game against Cobh Ramblers. 
Sunderland.
He joined Sunderland on 25 July 2008 for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £250,000 which has risen close to £500,000 after appearances and his first Ireland Senior Call Up. He became their third summer signing and followed the footsteps of former Cork City teammate Roy O'Donovan to make a switch to Stadium of Light. However, it was not until a year and a half after joining Sunderland, that Meyler made his first professional appearance for the club, starting against Blackburn Rovers on 28 December 2009. In his third appearance for Sunderland, at Portsmouth on 9 February 2010 Meyler received a straight red card just minutes after coming on as a second half substitute. Meyler suffered serious cruciate ligament damage against Manchester United on 2 May 2010, leaving him sidelined for 12 months.
However, he made a quicker recovery than expected, making his comeback for Sunderland's Reserves against Liverpool Reserves, on 2 November 2010. Manager Steve Bruce insisted Meyler would not be rushed back to first team action. Surprisingly, he returned in an away match at Fulham, featuring for 52 minutes in a 0–0 draw. On 5 January 2011, Meyler pulled up suddenly and was stretchered off in Sunderland's away match at Aston Villa. It was revealed after the game by Steve Bruce that Meyler suffered cruciate ligament damage to the same knee as before. It was later announced by Sunderland that Meyler had a scan on the knee and had torn his medial ligament. This ruled Meyler out for another 10 weeks at least rather than 6 months which was first feared. Meyler returned to the Sunderland bench for their defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April 2011.
Meyler continued to be eased back to fitness by Sunderland in the 2011–12 season, playing in several reserve fixures before making a cameo substitute appearance in the 2–2 draw with West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 2011. Meyler also came on as a late substitute against Aston Villa and Manchester United. Meyler's first appearance under Martin O'Neill came as a 63rd minute substitute in the 4–1 win at Wigan Athletic on 3 January 2012. Meyler made his first start of the season at Stoke City on 4 February, and was involved in controversy when Robert Huth received a straight red card for a challenge on the Irishman. Sunderland went on to win 1–0, and Stoke manager Tony Pulis was unhappy with Meyler's reaction: "I think Robert commits himself them pulls out, and I don't think he actually touches Meyler, or whatever his name is, and I'm really disappointed at the player's reaction... I don't think Robert actually touches the lad, and the way he goes down and rolls around, for me he's done it for one reason and that was to get him sent off." Meyler did not start another game for the rest of the season, although he frequently appeared as a substitute. Making 10 appearances from the bench including some massive wins for the club.
Hull City.
On 8 November 2012, Meyler was reunited with former manager Steve Bruce as he went out on loan to Hull City until 1 January 2013.
He made his debut from the bench as a second-half substitute for Jay Simpson in the away match at Cardiff City on 10 November 2012. He scored his first goal for the club on 8 December 2012 when he opened the scoring in the 1–2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road. He scored again in the following game on 15 December, completing a 2–0 win at home to Huddersfield Town.
On 8 January 2013, Meyler was signed by Hull permanently on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. On 1 December 2013, Meyler scored his first Premier league goal against Liverpool in a 3–1 home win. On 1 March 2014, Meyler was involved in a touchline scuffle with Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew, who appeared to headbutt the Hull City midfielder.
International career.
Meyler made his international debut in Cork for the Republic of Ireland U21 team against Germany in February 2009. He had been selected for the Republic of Ireland senior squad when his first knee injury struck, forcing him to withdraw.
On 1 September 2012, Meyler was called up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. He had been called up to the squad as a replacement for Darron Gibson who took a break from international football following Ireland's disappointing Euro 2012 campaign. He made his senior international debut in a 4–1 win over Oman at Craven Cottage on 11 September 2012.

Johannes Edfelt

Bo Johannes Edfelt (December 21, 1904 – August 27, 1997), was a Swedish writer, poet, translator and literary critic.
A native of Tibro, Edfelt was elected to be a member of the Swedish Academy in 1969, occupying seat No. 17. He succeeded Erik Lindegren and, following his death, was succeeded by Horace Engdahl.
Amongst other writings, Edfelt translated works by Nelly Sachs, Georg Trakl, Novalis, Andreas Gryphius, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.
Biography.
Youth.
Edfelt was the son of lieutenant August Edfelt and Ellen Hellner. He grew up in Skara, where he studied Latin and Greek at the senior high school. In fall 1923, he studied Nordic Languages at Lund University. He also attended public lectures in Philosophy and History of Literature. 
From 1924 to 1930, with exception from his military service in 1925–26, Edfelt studied Nordic Languages, English, German, History of Literature and Pedagogics, including a course in History of Philosophy, at Uppsala university. During this period, he attended student circles that discussed Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung.
Early career.
After he had taken his Master's Degree in Uppsala in spring 1930, Edfelt moved to Stockholm. The financial crisis following the Wall Street crash of 1929 soon made its impact on the Swedish labor market, and in the beginning of the 30s Edfelt earned his living by writing literary reviews. In fall 1931, he was hired as a temporary-staff master at the municipal school in Storvik in Gästrikland.
During winter 1930–31, Edfelt in Stockholm became acquainted with the female artist Hélène Apéria, to whom he later would dedicate his collection "Aftonunderhållnng" (Evening Entertainment). On March 2, 1932 the couple married at Nyloftet in Skansen in Stockholm.
In 1933, Edfelt temporary moved to the small town of Mariefred, where he completed his collection "Högmässa" (High Mass) under observation from the older poet Bertil Malmberg, who had settled down in the country idyll after his years in Munich.
Poetry.
Early Books.
In 1923, Edfelt made his debut with the poetry collection "Gryningsröster" (Dawn Voices) 1923, when he was only 19 years old. Then followed the collections "Unga Dagar" (Young Days) 1925 and "Ansikten" (Faces) 1929. Except the classics, he was influenced by Franz Werfel, Bertolt Brecht, Erich Kästner, Vilhelm Ekelund, Harriet Löwenhielm och Birger Sjöberg.
Breakthrough.
Edfelt's mature poetry might be described as traditionalistic in form but modernistic in imagery. He got his major breakthrough in 1934 with "Högmassa" (High Mass), which was reviewed in many Swedish dailies. By that time, Edfelt was influenced by Swedish poets such as Bertil Malmberg, Birger Sjöberg, Bo Bergman and Erik Axel Karlfeldt but also by international celebrities such as Charles Baudelaire, Bert Brecht and T. S. Eliot. 
Another characteristic trait for Edfelt's poetry from the 1930s are innumerous allusions to literature ranging from the Bible and ancient tragic playwrights to psychoanalysis and Modernism. Sometimes Edfelt even re-uses a part of the metric structure from older Swedish poets in order to create a certain mood.
"Aftonunderhållning" (Evening Entertainment) 1932, "I Denna Natt" (This Very Night) 1936, "Vintern Är Lång" (The Winter Is Long) 1939 and "Sång för Reskamrater" (Song for Travelling Companions) 1941 all belong to the same creative period as "Högmässa". The contrast between dark human suffering and the redeeming flame of love distinguishes these books.
A New Direction.

Bahá'í Faith in Germany

Though mentioned in the Bahá'í literature in the 19th century, the Bahá'í Faith in Germany begins in the early 20th century when two emigrants to the United States returned on prolonged visits to Germany bringing their newfound religion. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was established following the conversion of enough individuals to elect one in 1908. After the visit of `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, and the establishing of many further assemblies across Germany despite the difficulties of World War I, elections were called for the first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1923. Banned for a time by the Nazi government and then in East Germany the religion re-organized and was soon given the task of building the first Bahá'í House of Worship for Europe. After German reunification the community multiplied its interests across a wide range of concerns earning the praise of German politicians. German Census data shows 5600 registered Bahá'ís in Germany in 2012. But there might be much more who are not enrolled in the official community. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 11743 Bahá'ís in 2005.
First century.
Early phase.
Ibrahim Kheiralla, an early Bahá'í from Lebanon, traveled through Germany in 1892 attempting to making a living but found no interest in his inventions and moved on to the United States in February, 1893. There he managed to convert some individuals by 1895 (see Thornton Chase.) Following these conversions, some German emigrants became Bahá'ís as well. Two in particular traveled back to Germany: Edwin Fischer and Alma Knobloch. Dr. Edwin Fischer, a dentist, had emigrated in 1878 from Germany to New York, became a Bahá'í there, and then returned to Stuttgart in 1905. Fisher used every opportunity, including talking with his patients, to mention the Bahá'í teachings, and in time a few Germans embraced the religion. The other German Bahá'í, Alma Knobloch, became a Bahá'í in 1903, before Fischer, but arrived in Germany in 1907. This small group of Bahá'ís began to organize and formed a Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in 1908 and by 1909 began self-publishing pamphlets and letters and Bahá'í books including the Hidden Words and a history of the religion by Knobloch. The second spiritual assembly in Germany was founded in 1909 in Esslingen.
In the German Colony in Palestine, as part of the world wide German diaspora, "Frau Doktor Fallscheer" was the family physician for the family of `Abdu'l-Bahá, son of the founder of the religion. Fallscheer later became a Bahá'í when she moved back to Germany by 1930. Prominent early Bahá'í Louis George Gregory stayed at a hotel in the German Colony in Haifa during his Bahá'í pilgrimage to Palestine in the spring of 1911 and on his return trip visited in Germany at the request of `Abdu'l-Bahá in the fall of 1912.
`Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to Germany.
`Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, visited Germany for 8 days in 1913, including visiting Stuttgart, Esslingen and Bad Mergentheim. During this visit he spoke to a youth group as well as a gathering of Esperantists. In less than a decade Bahá'í sources state there were some 300 Bahá'ís in Germany by the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá's arrival. See `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West.
`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book "Tablets of the Divine Plan". The seventh of the tablets mentioned European regions and was written on April 11, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented on April 4, 1919, and published in "Star of the West" magazine on December 12, 1919 and mentioned Germany. He says:
"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."
`Abdu'l-Bahá praised the German Bahá'ís - "individuals...endued with perceptive eyes and attentive ears" were "attracted to the principles of the oneness of mankind" and treated "all the peoples and kindreds of the earth in a spirit of concord and fellowship." He predicted Germany will "surpass all other regions" and "lead all the nations and peoples of Europe spiritually." Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, continued commentary about Germany and its Bahá'ís; he wrote that during the Nazi government the German Bahá'ís demonstrated that they were the "great-hearted, indefatigable, much admired German Bahá'í community".
World War I.
As World War I was becoming more widespread in its ramifications, the Bahá'ís pursued other courses of action. In 1916 a plaque was raised to honor `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit at Bad Mergentheim. On May 23, 1916, Austrian Franz Pöllinger learned of the religion while staying in Stuttgart and on returning to Austria had a prominent role in the growth of the religion there. When the United States entered the war, individuals from there, as Fischer and Knobloch, had to leave Germany and both returned to the United States. On return to the US Fischer went to the Los Angeles area and Knobloch went to New York. In a wave of anti-German sentiment (see German American internment for similar issues a generation later) Fischer was caught up in charges of espionage for Germany which were dismissed. As Germany was allied with the Ottoman Empire, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of WWI played an important role with the Bahá'ís in Palestine - particularly the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918. As a direct result of the events of the battle, `Abdu'l-Bahá was rescued after death threats were made against him in case the Ottoman side was to lose (events in which Wellesley Tudor Pole played a significant part.)
Post-War closing.
After WWI, the national Bahá'í community organized a German Bahá'í Publishing Trust and in 1920 Adelbert Mühlschlegel became a Bahá'í, and later appointed as a Hand of the Cause, individuals who have been considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion. He was the first of three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís. As with other German emigrants who converted to the religion, Siegfried Schopflocher who was born in Germany, as an Orthodox Jew, sought out a wider unity and found the Bahá'í Faith while in Canada in the summer of 1921; he was also later appointed a Hand of the Cause. `Abdu'l-Bahá's last tablet before his death was addressed to the Bahá'ís in Stuttgart in November 1921.
Inter-war period.
In 1921 a new magazine "Sun of Truth" was first published as one of five Bahá'í journals produced by German Bahá'ís through the 1920s. It contained newly translated Bahá'í literature and news from the Bahá'í community around the world.
In 1923 the first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assemblies were elected "where conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size". Along with India and the British Isles, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Germany and Austria was first elected in that year. In 1925 there were 95 delegates who performed the election. A 1925 list of local Bahá'í Centers mentions no less than 26 in Germany, compared to three in England and two in Switzerland. In late 1926 and again in 1929 widely traveled Martha Root spoke in most German universities and technical colleges. Eugen Schmidt, the second of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís, became a Bahá'í and was elected a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany from 1932 for many years and served as chairman in the decisive years of re-building after World War II.
Among the Bahá'ís to visit Germany were Amelia Collins, Marion Jack and Louisa Mathew Gregory, wife of Louis George Gregory. Another Bahá'í with links to Germany was Robert Sengstacke Abbott whose adoptive father was German and, through his family connection, he kept in contact with his family in Germany. In 1930 the national convention included delegates from Stuttgart, Rostock, Hamburg, Schwerin, Karlsruhe, Göppingen, Bissingen, and from Vienna. The 1931 national assembly included four women and five men. In 1935 Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, re-organized the German community to cover Austria as well so they shared a regional national assembly.
Nazi period.
During the early Nazi period Bahá'ís had general freedom; May Maxwell, wife of William Sutherland Maxwell, was still able to travel through Germany in 1936, though the plaque commemorating `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit had been taken down. By 1937 however, Heinrich Himmler signed an order disbanding the Bahá'í Faith's institutions in Germany because of its 'international and pacifist tendencies'. In 1939 and in 1942 there were sweeping arrests of former members of the National Spiritual Assembly. In May 1944 there was a public trial in Darmstadt at which Dr. Hermann Grossmann was allowed to defend the character of the religion but the Bahá'ís were instead heavily fined and its institutions continued to be disbanded. However for this service and others, Grossmann was ranked as the third of the three believers who decisively influenced the German Bahá'ís.
After the Nazi period.
Following the fall of Nazi Germany, an American Bahá'í, John C. Eichenauer who was a medic of the 100th Infantry division then at Geislingen started searching for the Bahá'í community in Stuttgart. He drove through Stuttgart looking and asking for Bahá'ís and was able to find an individual by nightfall/curfew. The next day saw the first meeting of Bahá'ís since their disbandment in 1937. Two other American Bahá'ís, Bruce Davison and Henry Jarvis, in Frankfurt and Heidelberg respectively, also connected with the Bahá'í community in Germany. At the beginning of the partition of Germany there were about 150 German Bahá'ís in the American section and they became registered with the American authorities. The National Spiritual Assembly was re-elected in 1946 and by 1950 there were 14 Local Spiritual Assemblies:
and smaller Bahá'í communities in 27 cities.
However in Soviet controlled East Germany, the Bahá'í Faith was again disbanded in 1948. In West Germany, by 1954 there were reports of large growth in the religion, and from 1951 to 1966 philately stationery and a "Cinderella stamp" religious stationery were produced in West Germany.
House of Worship.
The construction of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Langenhain near Frankfurt, began in 1952. Hand of the Cause Amelia Collins represented the Bahá'í International Community at the groundbreaking 20 November 1960. Designated as the "Mother Temple of Europe", it was dedicated in 1964 by Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum, representing the first elected Universal House of Justice.
Development in West Germany.
By 1963 the list of local assemblies was:
Isolated Bahá'ís were found in an additional 86 locations.
West German Bahá'ís were given the responsibility of trying to strengthen the Bahá'í community in Russia in 1963. During the 1960s and 1970s, a small number of Bahá'ís visited the Soviet Union as tourists but no attempt was made to promulgate the religion. In 1986 Friedo and Shole Zölzer and Karen Reitz from Germany traveled into the Soviet Union but remained for only short periods of time. Continuing in the 1980s and into the 1990s the Bahá'í Esperanto-League began to prosper especially in West Germany. One reason behind this was that Esperanto had acquired the reputation of being an "entrance ticket" to countries behind the Iron Curtain, countries to which the Bahá'í Faith had had little access during the preceding decades (the first post-WWII Bahá'í know to pioneer to Russia was in 1979.)
Reunion.
Following the German reunification in 1989-91 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany handed down a judgement affirming the status of the Bahá'í Faith as a religion in Germany. Continued development of youth oriented programs included the Diversity Dance Theater (see Oscar DeGruy) which traveled to Albania in February 1997. Udo Schaefer et al.'s 2001 "Making the Crooked Straight" was written to refute a polemic supported by the Evangelical Church in Germany written in 1981. Since its publication the Evangelical Church in Germany has revised its own relationship to the German Bahá'í Community. Former member of the federal parliament Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker commended the ideas of the German Bahá'í community on social integration, which were published in a statement in 1998, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent a congratulatory message to the 1992 ceremony marking the 100th Anniversary of the Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh.
Multiplying interests.
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Nearing the century mark of the Bahá'í community in Germany, the Bahá'ís in Germany have begun efforts in diverse fields of interest. An estimated 500,000 people visited the Bahá'í pavilion at the Hanover Expo 2000. The 170 square-meter Bahá'í exhibit, hosted by the Bahá'í International Community and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Germany, featured development projects in Colombia, Kenya and Eastern Europe that illustrated the importance of grassroots capacity-building, the advancement of women, and moral and spiritual values in the process of social and economic development. The German community organized a national Bahá'í Choir in 2001 which tours various events in Germany and Europe. In 2002 the director of the Ernst Lange-Institute for Ecumenical Studies held a meeting under the auspices of the German Federal Environment Ministry titled "Orientation dialogue of religions represented in Germany on environmental politics with reference to the climate issue" for the interfaith community including the Bahá'ís. In 2005 former federal Minister of the Interior, Otto Schily, praised the contributions of German Bahá'ís to the social stability of the country, noting "It is not enough to make a declaration of belief. It is important to live according to the basic values of our constitutional state, to defend them and make them secure in the face of all opposition. The members of the Bahá'í Faith do this because of their faith and the way they see themselves." However the Bahá'ís have been excluded from other dialogues on religious issues. In 2007 a new memorial was unveiled replacing the one that had been taken down in Bad Mergentheim during Nazi Germany. Bahá'ís from much of Europe were among the more than 4,600 people who gathered in Frankfurt for the largest ever Bahá'í conference in Germany in February 2009.
Demographics.
A 1997-8 estimate is of 4000 Bahá'ís in Germany (40 in Hannover). In 2002 there were 106 Local Spiritual Assemblies.
The 2007-8 German Census using sampling estimated 5-6,000 Bahá'ís in Germany. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 11,743 Bahá'ís.
Artists.
Among the better known Bahá'í artists of Germany are:
Prophecies regarding Germany.
The writings of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá in the late 19th century and early 20th century contain some prophecies regarding Germany. The first mention related to Germany in the Bahá'í Faith is when the founder of the religion, Bahá'u'lláh wrote in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in 1873:
O banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous glory.
In 1912, shortly before visiting Germany, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke of the increasing tensions in Europe:
We are on the eve of the Battle of Armageddon referred to in the sixteenth chapter of Revelation... The time is two years hence, when only a spark will set aflame the whole of Europe... by 1917 kingdoms will fall and cataclysms will rock the earth. and in January 1920 he wrote:
The ills from which the world now suffers... will multiply; the gloom which envelops it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented. Its restlessness will increase. The vanquished Powers will continue to agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of war.

Jukjangchang

The jukjangchang, literally "bamboo long spear", is the name of Korean weapon which is first mentioned in the Muyesinbo (1759). As the name suggests, the spear was made from bamboo and quite long, about 4.2 meters. Sometimes the "jukjangchang" would be made of either whole bamboo stalk or pieces of bamboo glued and woven together. The latter type was stronger. 
The bamboo made the "jukjangchang" more flexible than the ordinary "jangchang". The weapon could be used to keep the enemy at a distance.

Indian gauge

Indian gauge, , is a broad track gauge commonly used in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Argentina and Chile. It's also the gauge that is used on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. 
Scotland.
This gauge was first used in Scotland for two short, isolated lines, the Dundee and Arbroath Railway (1836-1847) and the Arbroath and Forfar Railway (1838- ).
India.
In India, the Governor-General James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 10th Earl of Dalhousie determined that a wider gauge than standard gauge was more suitable for larger firebox and stability in high winds and long steep gradients.
"The first agreement of the Government of India with East Indian Railway Company and Great Indian Peninsula Company in 1849 stipulated that railways in India would be built on a four feet, eight and half inches gauge. However, soon there were disagreements with Lord Dalhousie favoring a six feet gauge and Mr. Simms, the consulting engineer favoring five feet and six inches gauge. Gauge is the distance between two rails. The debate was finally settled in favor of the five and half feet gauge, called the broad gauge in 1850s and the first train that ran from Bombay to Thane ran on broad gauge."
In the late 20th century, India adopted Project Unigauge. Gauge conversion towards Indian gauge is underway, replacing several narrow gauges and meter gauges.
North America.
Canada.
In the 1850s it was first used in Canada, and was then used in other British colonies. It was known as the "Provincial gauge" in Canada. Having a break-of-gauge was seen as having defence value, the War of 1812 still being a fresh memory. The Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad was laid in 1836 to gauge. 
The Grand Trunk Railway which operated in several Canadian provinces (Quebec and Ontario) and American states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont) used it, but changed to standard gauge by 1873. The Grand Trunk Railway was operated from headquarters in Montreal, Quebec; but corporate headquarters were in London, England. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad which operated in Quebec, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine also used it and was converted in 1873.
United States.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit system uses Indian gauge. The New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western Railroad (NOO&GW) used Indian gauge until 1872, and the Texas and New Orleans Railroad used Indian gauge ("Texas gauge") until 1876. The Grand Trunk Railway predecessor St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad which operated in Quebec, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine also used Indian gauge ("Canadian gauge" or "Portland gauge") and was converted in 1873. Several Maine railroads connected to the Grand Trunk Railway shared its "Portland Gauge". The Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad and the Buckfield Branch Railroad were later consolidated as the Maine Central Railroad which converted to standard gauge in 1871. The only electric streetcar system in the U.S. to use this gauge was that of Fairfield, Maine.
John A. Poor's chief engineer Alvin C. Morton compiled the following advantages of "Portland Gauge" for Maine railways in 1847:

Lawrence J. Epstein

Lawrence Jeffrey Epstein (born 1946), is an American author who writes and lectures about American culture and society and Jewish life. He is best known for his book "The Haunted Smile: The Story of Jewish Comedians in America". His latest book is "The Basic Beliefs of Judaism: A Twenty-first-Century Guide to a Timeless Tradition". His website describes the book as "an organized, accessible, and systematic explanation and analysis of the central Jewish articles of faith."
Background.
Epstein was born in New York City and raised there and in Sag Harbor, New York. His father was a merchant and Veterans’ Counselor. His mother was a photographer and housewife. He got a B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. from the University at Albany. From 1974 until 2008 he was a professor of English at Suffolk County Community College, where he also held jobs as Assistant Head of the Department of English and Chairperson of the Humanities Division.
In an interview, Epstein described his intentions for "The Haunted Smile": “I wanted to tell the story of Jewish comedians in America starting at the turn of the 20th century…Then I traced the history of the comedians through vaudeville, radio, movies, and tv…I was interested, for example, in how one generation of comedians influenced another. I got to go to a Friars Roast and go backstage at a comedy club. I also interviewed more than 70 people…I wanted to include the struggles Jewish comedians had, and the weight of their past.”

Y and Z Holes

The Y and Z Holes are two rings of concentric (though irregular) circuits of near identical pits cut around the outside of the Sarsen Circle at Stonehenge. The current view is that both circuits are contemporary. Radiocarbon dating of antlers deliberately placed in Y Hole 30 provided a date of around 1600 BC, a slightly earlier date was determined for material retrieved from Z 29. These dates make the Y and Z holes the last known structural activity at Stonehenge. The holes were discovered in 1923 by William Hawley, who, on removing the topsoil over a wide area noted them as clearly visible patches of ‘humus’ against the chalk substrate. Hawley named them the Y and Z because he had earlier, for a short time, labeled the then recently discovered Aubrey Holes the ‘X’ holes. 18 of the Y Holes have been excavated and 16 of the Z Holes. Further evidence of the Y and Z Holes being late in the sequence of events at Stonehenge is demonstrated by the fact that hole Z 7 was found to cut into the backfill of the construction ramp for stone 7 of the Sarsen Circle.
Description.
The outer Y ring consists of 30 holes averaging 1.7m x 1.14m tapering to a flat base typically close to 1m x 0.5m, the inner Z holes, of which only 29 are known (the missing hole may lie beneath the fallen sarsen stone 8), are slightly larger, on average by some 0.1m. They can be best described morphologically as ‘wedge-shaped’. The diameter of the Y circuit, i.e. the best - fit circle is some 54m, that of the Z Hole series, around 39m. 
The fills of the holes was found to be largely stone free, these deposits are thought to be the result of the gradual accumulation of wind-blown material. Examples of almost every material, both natural and artefactual, that have been found elsewhere at Stonehenge have been retrieved from their fills; this includes pottery of later periods (Iron Age, Romano-British and Medieval) also coins, horseshoe nails, and even human remains.
A new landscape investigation of the Stonehenge site was conducted in April 2009 and a shallow bank, little more than high, was identified between the two hole circles. A further bank lies inside the "Z" circle. These are interpreted as the spread of spoil from the original holes, or more speculatively as hedge banks from vegetation deliberately planted to screen the activities within.
Interpretation.
Neither Hawley, nor Richard Atkinson who investigated two of the holes (Y and Z Holes 16) in 1953 thought that uprights of timber or stone had ever been present. Atkinson however suggested that they had been intended to house bluestones, the question remains unresolved. Although unique in many ways a similarity of form between these holes and the contemporary grave pits under the Bronze Age Barrow mounds has been pointed out. Attempts at interpreting the methods of construction used in building the stone monument sometimes show the Y and Z Holes used to locate temporary scaffold–like timber structures or ‘A’ frames. The fact that the stonework has been shown to be around 700 or 800 years earlier than the Y and Z Holes clearly precludes the possibility that the holes represent features cut for constructional purposes. For the same reason the Y and Z Holes cannot be logically introduced into any scheme that suggests they performed a structural function within the design of the stone monument.
Some interpretations introduce the idea that the holes were deliberately laid out in a ‘spiral’ pattern. However their irregular pattern still retains an integrity that can be explained as reciprocal errors created by prehistoric surveyors using a cord (equal to the radius of each circuit) passed around the stone monument 
(the presence of the stones would have prevented an accurate circle from being scribed from the geometric centre of the site). The distances between the two circuits appears to have been established by the geometry of simple square and circle relationships (i.e. the Z circuit is contained within a square inscribed within the Y circuit).

Iberian gauge

Iberian gauge (, ) is the name given to the track gauge most extensively used by the railways of Spain and Portugal: .
As finally established in 1955, the Iberian gauge is a compromise between the similar, but slightly different, gauges adopted as respective national standards in Spain and Portugal in the mid-19th century. The main railway networks of Spain were initially constructed to a gauge of six Castilian feet, or two Castilian yards. Those of Portugal were instead built to a and later railways to a gauge of five Portuguese feet – close enough to allow interoperability with Spanish railways.
Causes for the difference from international standard gauge.
A commonly cited reason for the adoption of this gauge, broader than that which became the international standard, is that it was intended to hinder any use of the railroad in any of the French invasion attempts. This is possible, but the 19 January 1845 governmental decree does not state any reason, simply the gauge itself. It is known that the government entrusted such decisions to a committee, whose main work was done by civil engineers Juan Subercase and Calixto Santa Cruz: both good civil engineers but with little experience in railroads. Their judgement, made because of their profession and lack of experience in railroads, was that since the Spanish landscape was more mountainous than that of England and France, a wider gauge would make more powerful locomotives possible, with larger boilers and, more importantly, larger fireboxes. This was obviously a miscalculation; in other areas of Spain, narrower gauges were used in the most mountainous areas, since Iberian gauge works in such areas was too expensive. One example of this is the gauge FEVE.
Adoption of the international gauge in Spain and Portugal.
Since the beginning of the 1990s new high-speed passenger lines in Spain have been built to the international standard gauge of , to allow these lines to link to the European high-speed network. Although the 22 km from Tardienta to Huesca (part of a branch from the Madrid to Barcelona high-speed line) has been reconstructed as mixed Iberic and standard gauge, in general the interface between the two gauges in Spain is dealt with by means of gauge-changing installations, which can adjust the gauge of appropriately designed wheelsets on the move.
Plans exist to convert more of the Iberian-gauge network in Spain and Portugal to standard gauge, an indication of which is the use, on several stretches of recently relaid broad-gauge track, of concrete sleepers pre-drilled with additional bolt holes allowing for repositioning of one rail to adjust the track to international gauge or the narrowing of the gauge by moving both rails closer together maintaining the perfect alignment of the loading gauge.

John Grant (children's author)

John Grant is a Scottish author and illustrator, possibly best known as the author of the "Littlenose" series of children's stories, which he read on the BBC's "Jackanory" in 55 programmes from 1968 to 1986.
As a student, Grant earned extra cash illustrating learned academic papers and designing menus, toast lists and illuminated addresses, and during National Service he drew cartoons for the official army magazine "Soldier".
He originally invented "Littlenose" to entertain his children, but failed to find a publisher until BBC commissioned him to both write and present his stories of a little Neanderthal boy who was always getting into trouble. These proved a great success, and he went on to write and illustrate over 13 "Littlenose" books between 1968 and 1993.

Chervona Ruta group was created in 1971 by Anatoliy Evdokimenko with the Chernivtsi Philharmonic specially for the accompaniment of Sofia Rotaru. The founding members of the group were part of the pop orchestra of the Chernivtsi University.
For a long time, outside performances of the group by itself at occasional tours, Chervona Ruta was overshadowed by the People's Artist of Ukraine, People's Artist of Moldova, People's Artist of USSR - Sofia Rotaru. After Sofia Rotaru, other widely popular artists as Arkadiy Khoralov and Meritorious Artist of Moldova Anastasia Lazariuc started their career with Chervona Ruta.

Music on The O.C.

The use of music on FOX drama "The O.C." gained much acclaim. Show creator Josh Schwartz wanted music to be a "character on the show" and the experienced Alexandra Patsavas took the role of music supervisor. The show's orchestral music was composed by Christopher Tyng. The series is credited with showcasing many artists, and helping to elevate them in the music business. Many acts made guest appearances on the show, and others premiered their new singles in episodes. Six official soundtracks were released, and these were compilations of predominantly indie music.
History.
Alexandra Patsavas, who had previously worked on shows including "Roswell High" and "Carnivàle", was appointed as music supervisor on "The O.C.". Patsavas worked alongside creator Josh Schwartz, in selecting the music to be used. In an interview with IGN, Schwartz said that he had "always intended that music be a character on the show" and music was selected in two ways: either it was written into the script or it was selected to suit a scene. Patsavas stated that Schwartz scripted a lot of the music, with some songs being selected before she saw the episode script. For example, for an episode Schwartz had scripted a cover of "Champagne Supernova", got permission from Oasis and collaborated with band Matt Pond PA to write a cover of it for the show. On another occasion Schwartz went to Phantom Planet and asked for a mellow version of California. 
The reason "California" became the theme to show was because "Josh Schwartz loved the way it worked in a scene in the pilot." At other times they watch the episodes' editors cut and pitch song ideas for specific scenes. Each week Patsavas created a compilation from the new releases sent into the producers, and at times they were being "sent around 400 or 500 CD's a week". Fox and "The O.C." made indie rock a "main focus of the series" and also its marketing plan. Christopher Tyng, who composed the theme for "Futurama", composed the show's orchestral music which included the ending theme.
Shawn Rogers, Sub Pop's creative director of film and TV licensing, said that the shows choice of music was to "support bands and the style of music that they've been following" adding that artists were willing because "it pays well in comparison to what most indie bands make touring". However, Jimmy Tamborello, producer for The Postal Service, commented that it was just because "we're cheaper". Although exact figures are not known, Les Watkins, a music lawyer from Los Angeles, estimated that "a song by an emerging artist could fetch up to $20,000 or $30,000" and this is jointly split between record label and the songwriter/publisher. He stated that "once lawyers, managers, and the rest of the entourage get their piece, the artist may only see a fraction of the payout."
Artist performances.
The Bait Shop.
The Bait Shop is introduced in the second season as a new night club and concert venue on the pier. It was an undeniable reference to Beverly Hills, 90210's "Peach Pit". New character Alex works there and Schwartz described her as "our 'Nat', if you will." Schwartz described the venue:
Basically the Bait Shop is a little bit modeled after clubs like The Troubadour in Los Angeles or CBGB in New York, meaning it's kind of got more of a down, kind of older feel. It's on the pier and the idea was that maybe, once upon a time, it was an actual bait shop and now it's been converted into this rock club. I think it's really cool. It's got a lot of texture to it. It's got a lot of grit to it. It's been a great set for us and it's a great place for the kids to hang out. Because it's pier-adjacent, we get to go out there and shoot out by the water at night, too. I think it's just going to be a real iconic set for the show."
The actual filming location was the northeast corner of Redondo Beach pier.
Guest appearances.
Rooney were the first act to perform on the show, when the adolescents go to a concert as part of the episode "The Third Wheel". For the first season finale, singer Jem performed a cover of Paul McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed". For the second season, a club called the Bait Shop was introduced, and early on in the season the bands The Walkmen, The Killers, and Modest Mouse all featured on the show playing at the club. Although not strictly playing himself, actor Peter Gallagher (as Sandy Cohen) had previously sung on Broadway and in the episode "The Power of Love he serenades his wife Kirsten by singing a cover of Solomon Burke's "Don't Give Up on Me" at The Bait Shop. Other artists to perform at the club that season were The Thrills, Rachael Yamagata, and Death Cab for Cutie. In the episode "The Return of the Nana", Seth and Ryan visit Miami, and end up at a spring break style party where rapper T.I. guest stars as himself. For the third season, The Subways, Tom Vek, and Cobra Verde all made guest appearances performing in The Bait Shop.
Premieres.
In addition to having guest artists perform on the show, it also premiered many new music tracks: The Beastie Boys single "Ch-Check It Out" debuted on the show in the episode "The Strip" that aired April 28, 2004. During the second season, U2 debuted their song "Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own" at the end of an episode on December 2, 2004. Gwen Stefani debuted her single "Cool" in an episode on December 9, 2004. In promoting his new album, "Guero", Beck debuted five tracks from the album on March 10, 2005, with that week's installment being dubbed a "Beckisode" by the media. Another music premiere was Coldplay's song "Fix You", which debuted on May 12, 2005 in the final scene of the episode in which characters find out Caleb had a fatal heart attack. Imogen Heap, a former member of Frou Frou, had her new single debut on the show on May 19, 2005 – "Hide and Seek" featured twice in the episode "The Dearly Beloved". The single "Turn on Me" from band The Shins was first played in "The French Connection" on January 11, 2007.
Reception.
The show was heavily praised for its music. "The New York Times" described Schwartz as "the Shiva of contemporary music" and IGN described Patsavas as a "consummate tastemaker" for the show. Chris Carle from IGN described the show as "a staging area for quality music", and Ben Spier from "Entertainment Weekly" described the show as a "mixtaper's dream" Catherine Elsworth of "The Daily Telegraph" described the events of "The O.C." as being set "to a scrupulously hip soundtrack" and in another article stated that a "vital ingredient of his winning formula is the soundtrack, which draws on a broad range of modern alternative rock". Emily Zemler of PopMatters.com commented that the "writers seem to have impressive musical taste" and Barnes & Noble said that there was "probably no other show on television today where music is as important as it is on FOX's hit drama "The O.C."" "Rolling Stone" commented that the soundtrack was the reason people kept watching the show. However, when the show premiered U2's single "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own" Karyn L. Barr from "Entertainment Weekly" stated that the show that dedicated time to indie bands was "selling out." The Bait Shop inspired a club night at Barfly in Cardiff, featuring music similar to that featured on the show,
but Noah Davis of PopMatters.com criticised the show for its "plots were largely replaced by the gang's countless trips to the Bait Shop"
Artist promotion.
Throughout the show, Death Cab for Cutie have "occupied a minor role on "The O.C." as Seth Cohen's favorite band." Amy Phillips of "Willamette Week" described the band, within the context of the show, as follows. "Death Cab for Cutie is Seth Cohen's favorite band. He's got a Death Cab poster on his bedroom wall, plays Death Cab music in the car, gives Death Cab CDs to girls he likes." She also added at the time that "the more popular the character has become, the more fans the band has gained". Talking about their exposure on the show, Death Cab bass player Nick Harmer said that "there's really no other shows on television right now, other than 'The O.C.' that's really kind of showcasing bands in such a straightforward way." In 2004, the band's exposure on the show helped them get signed to Atlantic Records.
Hamilton Leithauser vocalist for The Walkmen said he considered "television performances as a solid, if ephemeral, means of promotion", but not all bands were eager to release their music for television shows. James Mercer, frontman for The Shins noted "that artists lose creative control" in the way that a song is interpreted, when the music is set to a particular scene. Additionally, fans and critics have stated that such appearances and mass marketing techniques are creating sell-outs. Indie band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were asked to perform on the show, but they turned it down because they were worried that it could diminish their credibility. Frontman Alec Ounsworth said "I don't like the idea of being overexposed", adding that it was analogous to the fact that "Vincent van Gogh never sold a painting, and he was perfectly content".
However, it was a successful method of promotion. Rooney experienced a "200 percent increase in sales" after being featured on the show. When "Youth Group, recorded a just-for-"The-O.C." cover of "Forever Young" song registered more than 5,000 iTunes downloads its first week" "The Daily Telegraph" stated that indie duo Viva Voce had "their profile sent through the roof with a guest slot on the soundtrack to teens-in-trouble TV drama "The O.C."". Imogen Heap became "a household name stateside" after being featured on the show and commented that she "was all over the message boards and in blogs. Those who hadn't watched the show heard about it and checked me out. It really was quite incredible to watch it unfolding. The sales off of iTunes went crazy!" The series was "responsible for "7 Days in Memphis", the debut solo album from Peter Gallagher" as well as "help launch The Killers to mass mainstream success"
Music from "The O.C.".
"The O.C." released six official soundtracks:
Patsavas, who was involved in selecting tracks the mixes, described the CDs as "not only a stand-alone piece but also as a companion to the show." Tammy La Gorce of Amazon.com described "Mix 1" as having "moments of subtle exceptionality until the end, when things get really good", "Mix 2" as a "collection that would slip effortlessly into any hipster's car CD player for its left of the dial leanings", and "Mix 3" as being a "modern, cynical, but likeably wide-eyed antidote to the heap of jingle-bell-heavy offerings" Mario Cuellar from "The Eastener" also commented that "Mix 2" has "music for everyone" Chris Carle of IGN commented that "Mix 4" is "shorter than the rest, which is a little disappointing, but almost all of the tracks deliver". Elisabeth Vincentelli of Amazon.com commented that "Mix 5"'s tracks "aren't innovative, but they are remarkably easy to like--even love" Pitchfork Media described "Mix 6" as a "collection of 12 covers, performed by B- and C-list artists" but Allmusic said that the "concept a cover album could have resulted in a lot of cookie-cutter, indie rock karaoke, but most of these covers are creative, and occasionally, they're inspired".

National Students of Ailing Mothers and Fathers Support Network

The National Students of Ailing Mothers & Fathers Support Network is the only nonprofit organization whose mission is to support all college students with an ailing or deceased loved one, empower all college students to fight back against terminal illness, and raise awareness about the needs of grieving college students.
They accomplish their mission by helping students to develop chapters of Students of AMF on college campus nationwide, providing information and support through their website at www.studentsofamf.org, hosting the annual National Conference on College Student Grief, and holding fundraising events- including the annual Boot Camp 2 Beat Cancer.
Campus Chapters.
Through a national marketing campaign, National Students of AMF seeks motivated students and faculty members to start Campus Chapters at their university. National Students of AMF continues to financially support the creation and sustenance of Campus Chapters.
Online Support Services.
National Students of AMF's website will provide a place for grieving college students to interactively support one another. Additionally, students will be able to receive expert advice from mental health professionals through chat rooms and blogging.
Conferences.
The inaugural National Conference on College Student Grief will be held in August 2008 in Raleigh, NC to bring together student, faculty, and administrative leaders from around the country to engage in a discussion on the issues of grieving college students and what needs to be done to support these students. This conference will also bring together leaders from each Campus Chapter of Students of AMF to discuss their experiences and effective ways to sustain the group on their campus.
Fundraisers.
The National AMF Weekend is held annually in August in Raleigh, NC and includes the Boot Camp to Beat Cancer and AMF Banquet. The 2006 AMF Weekend raised over $20,000 and the 2007 AMF Weekend raised over $40,000!
History.
Following the loss of David Fajgenbaum's mother, Anne Marie Fajgenbaum (AMF), to Brain Cancer in October 2004, he decided to create an outlet for students, who like himself, were suffering in silence-without support. Students of AMF began as a support group for 10 of David's peers and quickly grew into a support network that involves over 400 members of the Georgetown community. Currently, there are four programs that bring together the entire academic community take a unified and integrated approach to supporting these young adults. The Support Group brings together students who can share with other students in a safe, comfortable, and uplifting environment. The Service Group provides an opportunity for grieving and non-grieving students to join together in the fight against terminal illnesses. The Angels Program pairs faculty "Angels" with students in the support group to provide mentoring. The SAINTS Program provides mentoring to children in the community who have experienced a loss. Georgetown Students of AMF was recently named the University's "Outstanding Direct Service Program."
The national statistics indicated that this issue extended far beyond Georgetown. It is estimated that between 35-48% of all college students are grieving the death of a family member or close friend from within the last 24 months. Following inquiries from students and administrators from around the country about expanding Students of AMF, we decided to create the National Students of Ailing Mothers & Fathers Support Network in April 2006. The goal is to empower and support all grieving college students across the country by creating other campus chapters, providing interactive e-support on their website (www.StudentsofAMF.org), awarding leadership scholarships and research grants, holding conferences on college student bereavement, and hosting fundraisers. Already students and administrators from more than 20 universities have contacted AMF about starting a chapter of AMF on their campus.

Edward Sainsbury

Edward Sainsbury (5 July 1851 – 28 October 1930) was an English cricketer who represented, and captained, Somerset County Cricket Club in the late 19th century. During a 10-year first-class cricket career, he also represented Gloucestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).
Most commonly employed as a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but in an era when overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results and not being able to raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.
Early life.
Edward Sainsbury was born on 5 July 1851 in Bath, Somerset. He attended Sherborne School, an independent school in north-west Dorset. Playing for the school's cricket eleven he acquired a reputation for his slow underarm bowling, which could deceive even the most wary opponent into conceding his wicket. He was considered an even better batsman, and often opened the innings for the school.
Second-class county cricket.
His first recorded appearance for a representative county side was in 1877, when he played for the Gentlemen of Somerset against their Dorset neighbours. He opened the batting for the Somerset team alongside Hamilton Ross. Both had been scoring plenty of runs for Lansdown in club cricket, and Sainsbury made 32, a highly respectable score in the match, which Somerset won by an innings. Only Edward Lloyd scored more, posting an unbeaten 110, one of the earliest centuries scored for a Somerset county side. Sainsbury also opened the bowling during the match, but he claimed only one wicket over the two innings and bowled just 13 of the 104 overs. In two further appearances for the Gentlemen of Somerset in 1877, Sainsbury did not surpass the score he reached against Dorset but claimed two further wickets, both against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire. Sainsbury added himself to the list of early Somerset centurions during 1878, hitting 105 while batting at number 6 against Herefordshire. In doing so, he shared an eighth wicket partnership of 114 with Francis Reed, out of a Somerset total of 249. His bowling was also on form during the match, and after collecting two wickets in the first innings, he claimed five in the second.
The Somerset side during the late 1870s reflected the strength of the Lansdown club: of the eleven players that represented Somerset in their match against the Marylebone Cricket Club in early August 1878, five of them also represented Lansdown when the London club travelled down to Bath. Two further Somerset players who played in that match appeared for Lansdown at other stages of their careers. In between these two matches against the MCC, Sainsbury scored a half-century for Somerset during their match against the Gentlemen of Devon. Toward the end of August, Sainsbury's bowling once again came to the fore, as he claimed five wickets in the first innings against Worcestershire to help defend Somerset's lead and propel them to an innings victory.
Sainsbury struggled in county cricket during 1879; in nine appearances for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed better with the ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54 runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51 runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85 runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, this time with the bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.
During the 1881 season, Sainsbury was joined at Somerset by his older brother Francis, who appeared four times for the county. Sainsbury performed consistently with the bat during the season, regularly scoring between 20 and 40 runs in an innings. His highest score was made against Gloucestershire, when he reached his only half-century of the season, scoring 56 while batting at number seven. Sainsbury bowled less frequently during 1881, and rarely opened the bowling for Somerset. His best bowling performance of the season for his county came against Hampshire, when – having not bowled in the first innings – he claimed four wickets as Hampshire followed on. On this occasion he was the fifth bowler used by Somerset, but he bowled the highest number of overs.
First-class cricket.
Somerset's leading batsman.
Towards the end of the 1870s, journalists had suggested that Somerset chose their players "upon breeding rather than skill". The best players in the county, many of whom were not wealthy men, were unable to afford to play for Somerset. In turn, the cricket club could not afford to pay professionals to play for them, and were regarded as an occasional amateur outfit by many, rather than a side that could truly represent the strength of cricket within the county. The arrival of two professional players, and the acquisition of a permanent home ground in Taunton helped strengthen the club so that in 1882 they were admitted as a first-class county. Bill Roe, at the time a schoolboy, rated Sainsbury as "by far the best batsman in the side" during their pre-first-class years. On 8 June 1882, Somerset played their first match to be universally considered first-class, against Lancashire. After losing the toss and fielding for over 150 overs as Lancashire scored 237, Somerset responded with a first innings total of 29 – their second lowest total ever in first-class cricket. Sainsbury and his fellow opening batsman, Fowler, top-scored for Somerset with 9 runs each, and both were once again the highest scorers in the second innings, when Fowler scored 18 and Sainsbury 17 runs out of a total of 51. Somerset were beaten by an innings and 157 runs, and batted for less than 70 overs. The county suffered further heavy defeats in their next two matches, losing to Gloucestershire and Hampshire, with no Somerset batsman reaching a half-century in either match. Sainsbury reached his first half-century in first-class cricket when Somerset hosted Hampshire at the County Ground – team mates Robert Ramsay and Stephen Newton also passed 50 for the county in this match, which helped Somerset to their maiden first-class victory. Sainsbury claimed a wicket in each innings of the match, during which he bowled just eight overs: in the first innings he bowled one over, conceding one run and claiming one wicket. In first-class matches in 1882, Sainsbury scored 255 runs at an average of 17.00, exceeding 50 on only one occasion. He bowled infrequently, claiming four wickets at an average in excess of 40.
Sainsbury reached a half-century on his first appearance for Somerset in first-class cricket in 1883, scoring 51 runs against the MCC. He did not reach 50 in his next three appearances for the county, but against Gloucestershire he top-scored for his side in the their first innings with 59, and then when Somerset were forced to follow on, he scored his only century in first-class cricket, amassing 116 runs before he became one of W. G. Grace's eleven victims in the match. Sainsbury played in seven matches during 1883, and achieved his highest batting average in a season, his century and two fifties boosting him to 27.92. Although he played another 31 first-class matches during his career, he did not score more than 40 runs in an innings after 1883. He also recorded his best bowling average in 1883, claiming his nine first-class wickets at 18.55. In early June 1884, Sainsbury played for a side representing the South of England, scoring 3 and 29 during a 66-run victory for the South. Playing for Lansdown against the touring Gentlemen of Philadelphia the following month, he scored the only century of the match, reaching 108, and sharing a first wicket partnership of 149 with E. M. Grace. He batted poorly for Somerset during 1884, failing to reach double figures in most of his innings, and hitting a top score of 30 for the county. His season average was dramatically lower than the previous season, dropping below 10.
Troubled captaincy.
Following the departure of Somerset captain Stephen Newton, who played all his first-class cricket in London from the 1885 season onwards, Sainsbury was given the club captaincy. Somerset's first county match of the season took place in mid-July, almost two months after four of the counties had contested matches. The match, played against Hampshire, showed little sign of the troubles that were to come. Sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening the batting for his side, but the bowling of Edward Bastard, who claimed eight wickets in the first innings and three in the second, helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. The county's next match, played two weeks later against Gloucestershire, was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point. Gloucestershire won the toss and elected to bat, totalling 448 in 190 overs; Somerset bowlers James Parfitt and Charles Winter both conceding over 100 runs. In reply, five of the Somerset batsman were out for ducks; Sainsbury, Parfitt and Albert Clapp were the only ones to reach double figures. Sainsbury top-scored with 40 runs, but a team total of 100 meant that Gloucestershire forced his side to follow-on. The second innings progressed even more poorly for Somerset. Sainsbury was one of eight batsmen who failed to reach double figures, and the team was dismissed for 80 runs, resulting in an innings and 268 run loss.
Matches were played more frequently in August, and Sainsbury and his Somerset team had just four days to recover from their defeat before travelling to The Oval to face Surrey. Sainsbury once again lost the toss and was forced to field. Surrey batted for 222.1 overs as they accumulated 635 runs. Opening bowlers Parfitt and Winter once again conceded a century of runs apiece, and four of Somerset's other bowlers conceded over 50 runs each. In total, Sainsbury tried seven different bowlers during the innings to try to get wickets, including Herbie Hewett, who completed his career of 106 matches with just two first-class wickets. Sainsbury himself was the most successful of the bowlers, taking four wickets for 74 runs, his best first-class bowling performance. In reply, Somerset were bowled out for 83 runs, with Clapp recorded as "absent hurt". Following on, Somerset mustered a more respectable total of 251, aided primarily by a century from Octavius Radcliffe and 85 from Hewett. Sainsbury himself added 21 to the score in the second innings after being dismissed for one in the first. The defeat was heavier still than the one suffered a week earlier; Surrey won by an innings and 301 runs.
Morale was low at Somerset, and the county could not raise a full team to face Hampshire at Southampton a week later. They travelled with nine players, among their number Farrant Reed, who played eight first-class matches in his life, Ernest Murdock, who played five, Egerton Hall, three, and Edward Spurway, two. Somerset scored 117 runs in their first innings, of which Sainsbury contributed nine. The bowling of Bastard, who took eight for 59, helped to restrict Hampshire to 162. Despite their low numbers, Somerset reached 166 in their second innings, Sainsbury scoring ten from number five in the batting order. With Bastard unable to replicate his first innings performance, Hampshire reached the winning total of 123 from 60.3 overs. Somerset played Surrey and Gloucestershire in their final two matches of the season and lost both heavily, although they did succeed in avoiding any further record defeats; Surrey won by an innings and five runs, and Gloucestershire by nine wickets. Sainsbury's highest score in his four innings was 14. In the six matches that he played that season, all for Somerset, Sainsbury scored 119 runs at an average of 9.91, a marginal improvement on his previous season.
Return to second-class cricket.
Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton, during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. In Somerset's first match of 1886, Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years, scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241. The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents, Warwickshire, in the second innings; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory, Somerset were bowled out for 58. Throughout 1886, Sainsbury's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in the previous two years of first-class cricket, and he regularly made scores in the twenties and thirties. He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid-August, his highest score of the season. Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county, but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start. A victory over Essex, in which Sainsbury scored 71, was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire. Against Hampshire, Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset, scoring 164 out of a total of 315, to help his side on their way to a six-wicket victory. A big win over Warwickshire followed, and the county was said to be "a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity". Sainsbury's scores dipped again for Somerset in 1888; his highest total for the county was an unbeaten 42 against the MCC. In contrast, in a match played for the MCC, Sainsbury struck his highest total for the side, scoring 180 runs against Wiltshire at Lord's. Whether because of his dip in batting form, or as part of the reforms being enacted at the club by the new secretary, or simply due to residence, Sainsbury left Somerset at the end of the 1888 season. The minutes of a club meeting do not detail the reasoning behind the move, simply recording that his services had been lost.
Move to Gloucestershire.
Sainsbury played no county cricket during 1889 or 1890, but returned to county cricket, and indeed first-class cricket, in 1891 for Gloucestershire. His debut for the county in first-class cricket was against Kent in May, when he scored 12 runs during a rain-affected match. He was not the only former Somerset player to appear for Gloucestershire in the match – his fellow opening partner at Somerset, Octavius Radcliffe, had moved across the county border in 1886. Sainsbury played 13 times for Gloucestershire that season, with his highest score being 36, made against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. He scored 259 runs at an average of 13.63, and did not bowl. An appearance for Lansdown that summer, against the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, saw him score 228 runs in a drawn match. The following year was his last in first-class cricket, during which he made five appearances, all for Gloucestershire, scoring 100 runs, at an average of 10.00. He continued to play for Lansdown and the MCC for a number of years; his last recorded match was in 1894. Little is recorded of Sainsbury's life outside cricket. He died on 28 October 1930, aged 79 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.
Captaincy.
During Sainsbury's first year as Somerset captain, the county suffered two of its heaviest defeats in first-class cricket at the hands of Gloucestershire and Surrey, and was stripped of its first-class status. But it was the club secretary who was replaced at the end of that season, and Sainsbury remained in position as club captain, perhaps indicating that the club felt it was a lack of resources, rather than Sainsbury's captaincy, that was to blame for the poor performances. In "From Sammy to Jimmy: An Official History of Somerset County Cricket Club", Peter Roebuck suggests that Sainsbury was key in the improvements made by the county in 1888, but fellow cricket historian David Foot appears to portray a more negative image in his book "Sunshine, Sixes and Cider", suggesting that during Sainsbury's time as captain he may have included players in the team "on the strength of social charm and ability to drink into the early hours".

Hutchinson operator

In mathematics, in the study of fractals, a Hutchinson operator (also known as the Barnsley Operator) is a collection of functions on an underlying space "E". The iteration of these functions gives rise to the attractor of an iterated function system, for which the fixed set is self-similar.
Definition.
Formally, let formula_1 be an iterated function system, or a set of "N" contractions from a compact set "X" to itself. We may regard this as defining an operator "H" on the power set P "X" as
where "A" is any subset of "X".
A key question in the theory is to describe the fixed sets of the operator "H". One way of constructing such a fixed set is to start with an initial point or set "S"0 and iterate the actions of the "f""i", taking "S""n"+1 to be the union of the images of "S"n under the operator "H"; then taking "S" to be the union of the "S""n", that is,
and
Properties.
Hutchinson (1981) considered the case when the "f""i" are contraction mappings on a Euclidean space "X" = Rd. He showed that such a system of functions has a unique compact (closed and bounded) fixed set "S". The proof consists in showing that the Hutchinson operator itself is a contraction mapping on the set of compact subsets of "X" (endowed with the Hausdorff distance).
The collection of functions formula_5 together with composition form a monoid. With "N" functions, then one may visualize the monoid as a full N-ary tree or a Cayley tree.

Syrets concentration camp

Syrets concentration camp (also: Syretskij concentration camp) was a Nazi concentration camp established in 1942 in Kiev's western neighborhood of Syrets (Syretsk), part of Kiev since 1799. The toponym was derived from a local small river. Some 327 inmates of the KZ Syrets (among them 100 Jews) were forced to remove all traces of mass murder at Babi Yar. 
Establishment and location.
The concentration camp was established in 1942 at the former summer camp of the Kiev garrison on the northern edge of the city of Kiev, a few hundred meters from the Babi Yar ravine, which had been the scene of enormous massacres in late September 1941 and later. Syrets was intended to be a subsidiary of Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. About 3,000 people were imprisoned at Syrets, guarded by Ukrainian policemen and German SS. Paul Otto Radomski was the camp commandant.
The camp was built in June 1942 at the request of Hans Schumacher, a Nazi police official (see Auschwitz Trial), which he made to his superior Erich Ehrlinger. The camp was intended to house prisoners perceived as opponents of the Nazi regime, mainly Jews. Once a person was arrested, only skilled craftsmen would survive, to be used as forced labor. All others were shot or murdered by gas van. 
Camp operation.
The prisoners (women and men) were housed in wooden barracks and dug-outs with doors and stairs leading down from the ground level. The inmates were underfed and many starved to death, with daily mortality of around 10–15 people. Radomski ran a terror regime in the camp with the aid of "Kommandant" Anton Prokupek and a company of Sotniks. For the smallest misdemeanours he imposed heavy punishments and often struck the prisoners with the whip.
Syrets concentration camp.
In the course of the occupation, the Syrets concentration camp was set up in Babi Yar. Interned communists, Soviet POWs, and captured Soviet Partisans were murdered there. On February 18, 1943 three Dynamo Kyiv football players who took part in the Match of Death with the German Luftwaffe team were also murdered in the camp. It is estimated that about 25,000 people died in the Syrets camp.
Inmate revolt.
Before the Nazis retreated from Kiev, they attempted to conceal the many atrocities they had committed at Babi Yar. Paul Blobel, who was in control of the mass murders in Babi Yar two years earlier, supervised the Sonderaktion 1005 in eliminating its traces. For six weeks from August to September 1943, more than 300 chained prisoners were forced to exhume and burn the corpses (using local headstones as bricks to build ovens) and scattered the ashes on farmland in the vicinity (to this day many Ukrainians will not eat cabbage grown on those farms).
During the Sonderkommando 1005 exhumations, a group of prisoners secretly armed themselves with tools and scraps of metal they managed to find and conceal. They picked locks with keys they found on victims' bodies. Martin Gilbert quotes historian Reuben Ainsztein: 
On the night of September 29, 1943, as the camp was being dismantled, an inmate revolt broke out. The prisoners overpowered the guards using their bare hands, hammers and screw drivers. Fifteen people managed to escape. Among them was Vladimir Davіdov, who later served as a witness at the Nuremberg Trials. Among other escapees were Fyodor Zavertanny, Jacob Kaper, Filip Vilkis, Leonid Kharash, I. Brodskiy, Leonid Kadomskiy, David Budnik, Fyodor Yershov, Jakov Steiuk, Semyon Berland, Vladimir Kotlyar. Once Nazi control was re-established in the camp, the remaining 311 inmates were executed.
On December 6, 1943, Soviet authorities took a press party of Western journalists to the site of the Babi Yar massacres. Two of them, Bill Downs and Bill Lawrence, interviewed three Syrets-held Jewish prisoners of war who had been forced to participate in the mass disposal of bodies: Efim Vilkis, Leonid Ostrovsky, and Vladimir Davidoff. Downs described Vilkis' account of the prisoner escape:
According to Vilkis, some of the prisoners grew ill or went mad from the experience, and Nazi soldiers killed them as a warning to the rest. Three to five prisoners were shot each day.
Soviet camp.
When the Red Army took control of the city of Kiev on November 6, 1943, the Syrets Concentration Camp was converted into a Soviet camp for German POWs and operated until 1946. The camp was subsequently demolished and in the 1950s and 1960s urban development began in the area, which included an apartment complex and a park. The construction of a dam nearby also saw the ravine filled with industrial pulp. The dam collapsed in 1961, leading to the mudslide with numerous fatalities.

Vasily Yan

Vasily Yan. (Russian: Васи́лий Ян; 23 December 1874 (4 January 1875), Kiev - August 5, 1954, Zvenigorod Moscow Region) was a Russian writer. Also spelled "Vassily Yan" (or "Ian") or just "V. Yan", this is the pen name of Vassily Grigoryevich Yanchevetsky (Васи́лий Григо́рьевич Янчеве́цкий).
Born to a family of teachers, his father was from a Volynskih priests family, who graduated from seminary and taught Latin and Greek at the University Gymnasium.
In 1897, Yan graduated from the historical and philological faculty of St. Petersburg University. Impressions of a two-year tour of Russia form the backbone of his book "Notes of a Pedestrian" (1901). In 1901–1904 he served as inspector of wells in Turkestan, where he studied Oriental languages and lives of local people. During the Russian-Japanese war, he was a military correspondent for the St. Petersburg News Agency (SPA). In 1906–1913, he taught Latin at the first Petersburg Gymnasium. As an organizer of the scouts he met with Colonel Robert Baden-Powell, who came to Russia in 1910.
In the autumn of 1910 Vasily Yan introduced the magazine "Pupil". In 1913, he worked as a correspondent in Turkey SPA. In 1914, with the beginning of the First World War - he became SPA military correspondent in Romania. In 1918–1919 he worked in the Kolchak printing shop army camp in Siberia. After the restoration of Soviet power in Achinsk he worked as a teacher, correspondent and director of schools in Uryanhae (Tuva). He then became the editor of the leading newspaper "The Power of labour" in Minusinske. That was when he first adopted the pseudonym Yan. In 1923, he moved to Moscow.

Performance Car (magazine)

Performance Car, commonly abbreviated to PC, was an automobile magazine from the United Kingdom published by EMAP between October 1983 and July 1998. As suggested by the title, the magazine focussed on the high performance sector of the car market, from hot hatches through to supercars.
A magazine of the same name was launched in 2008.
Original magazine.
AGB Business Publications Limited launched "Performance Car" in October 1983. It replaced "Hot Car" magazine, a magazine that focussed on the tuned & modified car scene. The change of name came about due to a slight shift of focus to manufacturer-built performance cars. Early issues were titled Performance Car (incorporating Hot Car). The editor at launch was Ian Wearing.
In 1986, Jeremy Clarkson became a freelance columnist for the magazine. He would later go on to present the BBC motoring TV series "Top Gear", but continued to write for "Performance Car" until 1994, when the BBC issued him an ultimatum following the launch of "Top Gear magazine".
In the mid-1990s, the magazine changed its style, aiming to bring in a larger readership. The move backfired, and they later admitted they "went looking for extra readers that weren't there, and pissed off several thousand that were". Attempts to revert were somewhat successful in regaining readers, but publishers EMAP decided that as performance cars were being covered by other magazines there were not enough readers to justify keeping "Performance Car". The final issue, July 1998, was published on before the magazine was merged into EMAP's other motoring magazine "Car". Following one issue of "Car" with a Performance Car supplement, it remained much the same magazine as it was before, with little influence from "Performance Car".
Following its demise, several of the writers from "Performance Car", including Richard Meaden and John Barker went on to found a new magazine, "Evo", which was launched at the end of 1998 and covered similar topics to those of "Performance Car".
2008 relaunch.
"Performance Car" magazine was re-launched in 2008 by Unity Media. The editorial team was made up of Dominic Holtam, Chris Knapman, Dan Prosser and Max Earey. Dominic Holtam was editor of the publication after his spells at other Unity Media magazines including "Performance BMW". His aim was to continue the high quality aspect of the magazine whilist retaining a real world approach. The magazine closed once again at the end of 2009.
Dan Prosser subsequently founded his own online publication, Mud, Snow and Tar.

Bavarian A I

Bavarian A I engines were German steam locomotives in service with the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") from 1841 to 1871.
Three manufacturers were awarded a contract to build eight locomotives each, with the stipulation that the components of the different machines had to be interchangeable with one another. The engines achieved a speed of 33 km/h on a line with an incline of 1:200. The first engine was retired in 1871 and scrapped. Five other examples were rebuilt into B 1 locomotives and four were sold. The last one was scrapped in 1874.
They were coupled with 2 T 3,35 tenders.
Der Münchner.
Der Münchner (a "Münchner" is a man from Munich) was a Bavarian Class A I engine with the number 25. It was originally built for a private railway company which ran the route between Munich and Augsburg. In 1844 the line was taken over by the state railway and the engine was transferred into state ownership. A large part of the locomotive came from England, which can be seen from the typically English 'pear' shape of the outer firebox.
It was coupled with a 2 T 3 tender.

George Dunne

George W. Dunne (February 20, 1913 - May 29, 2006) was an American Democratic Party politician from Chicago, Illinois. He was President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners from 1969 to 1991; the longest service of anyone holding that office.
He was born in the Near North Side of Chicago, one of eight children of John and Ellen Dunne. His father died when he was twelve years old. He graduated from De La Salle Institute and attended Northwestern University for a year but dropped out. He became active in Democratic politics and was employed by the Park District, an agency in which many Democratic precinct captains were given patronage jobs.
He was appointed to a vacant seat in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1955, and was re-elected in 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1962. After eight years he became floor leader for the House Democrats.
In 1963 Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley appointed him to a seat on the Cook County Board. 
In 1969, he became President of the County Board, succeeding Richard B. Ogilvie, who had been elected Governor. Despite periodic revelations of questionable financial dealings, (Dunne owned and operated an insurance agency throughout his career in elected office), Dunne was re-elected in 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, and 1986. He was seen as a potential successor to Mayor Daley. In 1976, after Daley's death, Dunne did replace the late mayor as Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee. However, he did not become the party's choice for Mayor and never exercised the despotic power Daley had enjoyed as party chairman. In 1982, Dunne lost the party chairmanship to Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, an ally of Mayor Jane Byrne. Dunne was aligned with Chicago's first African-American Mayor Harold Washington during the Council Wars period and was re-elected to the party chairmanship after Vrydolyak resigned following his defeat by Washington in the 1987 Mayoral election.
Pushing 80 and yet enmeshed in a scandal in which he admitted having sex with female county employees who alleged they were pressured into providing sexual favors to him, Dunne did not seek re-election to the County Board Presidency or party chairmansip in 1990. However, he stayed on as Democratic Ward Committeeman of Chicago's 42nd Ward, a post he had held since 1961. Dunne was repeatedly re-elected to this position, which with the decline of patronage had declined in importance, until he resigned in 2003. He died in his farm in Hebron, Illinois on May 29, 2006.

Castel Sainte-Claire

The Castel Sainte-Claire is a villa in the hills above Hyères, in the Var Département of France, which was the residence of Olivier Voutier, a French officer who brought the Venus de Milo to France in 1820, and later of the American novelist Edith Wharton. Its garden is classified as one of the Notable Gardens of France.
History.
The Castel Sainte-Claire is located in the hills just above the old town of Hyères. Its park contains the ruins of part of the old walls of the city, dating to the end of the 12th century. The walls were destroyed by the order of Cardinal Richelieu during the reign of Louis XIII of France.
In the 17th century, the site was occupied by a convent belonging to the order of the Institute of Poor Women, created in Assisi in 1212, of which Sainte-Claire was the first Mother Superior. Following the French Revolution, the convent was closed, the convent was demolished, and the land was sold.
In 1820, the land was sold to the French naval officer and archeologist Olivier Voutier, best known as the man who brought the Venus de Milo from Greece to France. Voutier constructed the present villa, which he called La Villa Sainte Claire, and restored the ramparts of the old city between the villa and the ruins of an old tower. Voutier's grave is located in the park, next to the ruined tower.
In 1927, the property was purchased by the American novelist Edith Wharton, who used it as her summer residence. She called it "Sainte-Claire du Château" and created the garden in its present form, filling it with cacti and sub-tropical plants.
The villa was purchased by the city of Hyères in 1955, and the park became a public garden. Since 1990 it has been the office of the National Park of Port-Cros and the Botanical Preserve of Porquerolles (the island park off the coast of Hyères).

Paruyr Hayrikyan (Traditional Armenian: Պարոյր Հայրիկեան, Eastern Armenian: Պարույր Հայրիկյան, born July 5, 1949, Yerevan) is an Armenian politician and former Soviet dissident. Hayrikyan is one of the founders and most active leaders of the democratic movement in the Soviet Union. He is also a writer and an accomplished composer. He is the author of several patriotic songs popular in Armenia and Armenian Diaspora.
Biography.
Hayrikyan is a descendant of natives of Van and Constantinople. While he was in Nubarashen secondary school, Hayrikyan established the Union of Armenian Youth. In 1966 Hayrikyan was admitted to the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute. In 1967, he became a member of Armenia's underground National United Party (NUP). As a member of NUP Hayrikyan founded a new youth organization called "Shant". Hayrikyan risen to head of the NUP in 1968. He managed to establish several groups of the NUP, and to publish 5,000 copies of "Erkounk" (Torments) newspaper. The newspaper bore the motto: "Free Armenia or Death!" On March 29, 1969, Hayrikyan was arrested by KGB and sentenced to 4 years in prison in a special camp for political prisoners in Mordovia. 
In Soviet times, Hayrikyan was placed several times in penal labor camps for his political views and activities (he spent about 18 years in Soviet prison). 
In 1987, Paruyr Hayrikyan became leader and founder of the Union for National Self-Determination (UNSD) political party. He was eventually stripped of Soviet citizenship and exiled to Ethiopia after his accusations that the Soviet leadership instigated the Sumgait pogroms of Armenian population in Azerbaijan. In Addis Ababa Hayrikyan applied for and was granted asylum by the United States, where he remained for some time. During this period, Paruyr Hayrikyan acquired wide popularity, and was elected Chairman of the International Coordinating Center of the national democratic movement of the USSR, "Democracy and Independence". On May 20, 1990, while he was still in exile in the USA, he was elected a member of the Armenian Supreme Council. In 1990, following pressure of a group of United States senators led by Bob Dole, Mikhail Gorbachev restored Hayrikyan's citizenship and allowed him to return. Since then Hayrikyan has taken an active part in Armenian political life. As a candidate for Armenian presidential election, 1991 he was ranked second with 7% votes. Hayrikyan's supporters claimed that there were violations during the campaign, including an act of violence committed against him and his supporters in the village of Paravakar (Tavoush District). These charges were subsequently judged to be true by the Armenian court.
Since 1992, as an appointed Commandant of Goris, Hayrikyan took measures to ensure the efficient defense and organizing settlements of refugees in the Syunik and Artsakh. In 1995 he was re-elected to the Armenian Parliament as a leader of the UNSD faction.

When the founders of the party were imprisoned in 1968, Hayrikyan became the head of the National United Party (NUP). The main goals of (NUP) were independence of Soviet Armenia and Soviet Russia and the elimination of the consequences of the Armenian Genocide (1915-1923). In 1973, the National United Party re-elected Hayrikyan as its president. In the same year, Hayrikyan wrote his seminal political pamphlet "The Road to Independence through Referendum Strategy." On February 12, 1974, he was again arrested. During the trial Hayrikyan conducted himself as a consistent supporter of independence and civic rights. According to Jewish writer Mikhail Heifetz, not only Armenians, but also many other Soviet dissidents were among the members and supporters of NUP (Viacheslav Chornovil, Vasyl Stus, Eduard Kuznetsov, and others). On November 22nd, 1974, after the Hayrikyan's new trial, Andrei Sakharov signed an Open letter supporting Hayrikian.

Bryan Cooper (politician)

Bryan Ricco Cooper (17 June 1884 – 5 July 1930) was an Irish politician, writer and landowner from Markree Castle, County Sligo. He was prominent in Dáil Éireann in the early years of the Irish Free State, having previously served as MP to Westminster for South Dublin County (1910), a seat he subsequently represented in the Dáil from 1923 to 1930.
Life.
The Cooper family, Protestant landlords, had been involved in politics in Sligo since long before the 1800 Act of Union (which Joshua Cooper, a Privy Councillor at the time, strongly opposed). Bryan Cooper's father, Francis, was a major in the British Army stationed at Simla, India, where Bryan was born. His mother was the daughter of another Irishman serving in India, Major-General Maunsel Prendergast, who had married a Swiss woman there. The family returned to Ireland before Bryan was a year old, and then spent several years in postings around Britain, until his father was sent to South Africa at the start of the Anglo-Boer War. Bryan was educated (but not particularly happy) at Eton College. His father died during the war of Typhoid fever and Bryan came into his inheritance in Sligo.
Cooper joined the British Army and, following his father's advice, trained as a gunner at Woolwich (1902–03). A fellow-cadet ("R. T. H.") described him as "cheerful, well-mannered and pleasant", but more interested in books than in military matters. He resigned his commission a few years later and returned to Ireland, intending to enter politics – he once said that he entered politics to cure him of his shyness. In his spare time he wrote poetry strongly influenced by Celtic imagery and W. B. Yeats (whom he was later to befriend), and started work on a novel.
In 1908 he was appointed High Sheriff of Sligo. In January 1910 he was elected Unionist MP for South Dublin, defeating his nearest opponent by only sixty-six votes. During his election campaign he got to know a young lady of Irish ancestry from Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, a Miss Handcock, whom he married shortly afterwards. They were to have a daughter and three sons. He lost his seat at the December election later that year. Aged only 26, he was one of the youngest ever MPs to leave the House of Commons. He resigned his commission as a captain in the Reserves in May 1914, stating publicly that he had done so in sympathy with the officers in the Curragh, but he wrote in his private diary ("Uncensored Memoirs") that he had for years been fed up of the regime in the Reserves, and had been intending to quit. After the start of World War I he joined the Fifth (Service) Battalion of the Connaught Rangers. He saw action in Gallipoli, Thessalonika and Stavros. After the war he became Press Censor in Ireland and wrote "Ireland Under Sinn Féin". He got to know many writers and intellectuals active in Dublin at the time.
Major Cooper was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1923 general election as an independent Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin County constituency. W. B. Yeats was one of his chief supporters (of whom Cooper wrote: "since I was a boy his writings have been one of the strongest influences on me, and helped to make me the good Irishman I hope I am."). He was re-elected at the June 1927 general election. He joined the Cumann na nGaedheal party. Other former independents who joined "Mr Cosgrave's ranks" included Labour independent John Daly and Vincent Rice, formerly National League. He was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD at the September 1927 general election. He died in July 1930 and the subsequent by-election on 9 December 1930 was won by Thomas Finlay of Cumann na nGaedheal. He was one of the few people who served in the House of Commons and in the Oireachtas.
In 1931, his widow presented a half size reproduction of the ancient Lough Lene bell to Dáil Éireann and it has since been the bell of the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann.

Femme libérée

"Femme libérée" is a successful song recorded by French band Cookie Dingler. Written in 1984, it achieved a huge success in France and became a popular song throughout the years. It was the sole success of the band.
Background and writing.
Written in 1984 by Joelle Kopf and Christian Dingler under the label EMI Music, the song, which lasts 3:42, was a great success in the 1980s.
The song, released as a single on July 1, 1984, fell within the context of an era marked by the emergence of thoughtless songs which mocked some popular themes of society at the time. According to Elia Habib, an expert of French charts, the song reduced "freed women with a tender irony in an archetypal caricature" at a time when "the look is gaining importance and makes you "in" or not".
The song is available on many French compilations released in the 2000s, such as "Tubes d'un jour tubes de toujours spécial années 80" (2001), "Absolument 80: Tubes français Vol. 1" (2002), "Nostalgie Classiques 80" (2006), "Maxi Singles 80", "100 chansons françaises", "Nos années 80 - Platinum Collection" (2007).
Charts performances and awards.
In 1984, the song gained the price of the Union Nationale des Auteurs et Compositeurs awarded by the SACEM.
The single featured for 18 weeks on the French Singles Chart (Top 50), but this official chart began only on December 4, 1984, while the song was released five month earlier. It was #2 in the first edition of the chart, just behind Peter and Sloane's hit "Besoin de rien, envie de toi"; it stayed for two consecutive weeks at number 2. Then it dropped and totalled ten weeks in the top ten. In 1985, the single was certified Platinum disc by the SNEP. According to Infodisc website, 985,000 copies of the song were sold, making to date "Femme libérée" the 96th best-selling single of all time in France.
Cover versions.
The song was first covered in 1998 by Mireille Mathieu, Alain Souchon and Julien Clerc for an album of Les Enfoirés.
In 2005, Soma Riba band featuring DJ Fou covered the song but did not manage to reach success: The single peaked at #33 on the French singles chart on July 4, 2005 and remained on the top 100 chart for 16 weeks.

Paul Solomon

Paul Solomon (7 July 1939 – 4 March 1994) was a professed psychic and seer who claimed to channel answers to questions asked of him from a metaphysical "Source", similar to Douglas Cottrell, Andrew Jackson Davis and Edgar Cayce. These readings described subjects such as the former existence of Atlantis, general health, future changes to the Earth, sexuality, and religion.
Although Solomon was raised as a devout Baptist, his readings mention non-Christian teachings. Similar to Cayce, Solomon discusses Akashic records and reincarnation, as well as the nature of space, time, and matter. Solomon created the Fellowship of the Inner Light in 1972, an interfaith Church with a focus on spirituality.
Solomon worked as a humanitarian, and also gave lectures about spirituality. After having worked with Mother Teresa, he founded Dignity International, a human rights organization. In 1993, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the enslaved children of Thailand. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate from New Seminary for his continued interest and study of the Bible.
Biography.
Childhood.
Paul Solomon was born William Dove in Rogers, Arkansas. His father, Paul, was a Baptist minister, and the family often moved as a result of his father's career. As a child, Paul displayed seemingly paranormal behavior, which his parents believed to be derived from the devil. He claimed to see auras, describing them as 'good or bad lights' which surrounded a person, as well as being able to "read" books by placing them against his stomach to "absorb" their contents. At school, Solomon's classmates tested him by writing messages in their books to see if he could recall them. After being informed about these events, Solomon's parents implied that exhibiting paranormal activities was evil. Feeling guiltly about his actions, Solomon attempted suicide by cutting his chest. After having recovered, Solomon prayed and experienced a religious vision, which would later factor in his decision to become 'the youngest ordained minister in the Southern Baptist Church' at the age of fifteen.
Marriage, divorce, and hypnotism.
After finishing High School, Solomon joined the Army. He married in 1959, and, after leaving the army, enrolled at a Baptist Seminary as a minister. He worked as a preacher throughout Texas as well as opening a Prison ministry. In 1963, Solomon's wife left him for another man and took their daughter with her; the couple then divorced. Unable to work as a Baptist minister due to his divorce, Paul worked sporadically, taking on several different jobs. In 1971, Paul became depressed after his housemates left their shared home and turned to hypnotism to alleviate his depression. Harry Snipes, an acquaintance and amateur hypnotist, hypnotized Paul. Snipes suggested that the responses to his questions during the hypnosis were not Solomon's, but were from another source, or something more powerful than Solomon's own mind. In an attempt to verify Snipes' claim, Solomon traveled to ask his father whether he believed the results of his readings were heretical. Solomon's father said that he believed the responses were 'of God' and that Solomon's 'life work' was to investigate his supposed contact with the Holy Spirit.
Readings and teaching.
Solomon and Snipes pursued their hypnotism sessions, although Snipes would leave some time later. Solomon's "Source" told the pair that hypnosis was not necessary, but that he should instead close his eyes, at which point he would be 'guided'. Solomon began using his pseudonym Paul Solomon when approached by a journalist who suggested that he should use a pseudonym to protect his private life. Paul Solomon was a name received during a reading, which Solomon's "Source" described as meaning "Expositor of Wisdom".
The theory of 'Inner Light Consciousness' was developed by Solomon during this period and comprised various things he learned from his readings. He attempted to teach this to other people, but stopped giving readings between 1977 and 1979. Solomon felt that those who received information during his readings were not using the information they received in the correct manner. He also maintained that his readings were not essential, as everyone has the same ability to contact "The Source". Teaching this philosophy gained Solomon interest from the CIA, who were interested in his abilities and wished to use them to garner information on the KGB. The CIA withdrew their request after Solomon suggested that feeling love towards members of the KGB was an essential component of the endeavor.
Illness and death.
Solomon fell seriously ill with pancreatic problems in 1984. He went into cardiac arrest three times while staying in hospital and reported an out of body experience on each occasion. During these experiences he reported seeing angels and having further contact with "The Source". His health continued to falter until 1990 when he returned to hospital. Solomon attributes his rapid recovery to his affirmation that he wanted to live, and that he recovered from his malady in one day. He spent the last four years of his life working on humanitarian projects as well as teaching, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his help with enslaved children in Thailand. He was seriously injured while attempting to free an 11 year old slave and died at his home in Virginia Beach on 4 March 1994 after returning from Thailand.
Themes in Readings.
Atlantis.
Atlantis is described in the readings as having been a major continent situated between South America and Europe. Several cataclysms, some man-made, are described as having caused the continent to break into islands, and finally to sink altogether in approximately 10,000 BC. Atlantean civilization is described as evolving from the activities of souls manifesting in material forms through the use of what today would be seen as latent abilities, and developed into a technologically advanced civilization similar to that of contemporary man, with some differences. They are said to have harnessed the power of crystals to focus light and other forms of energy, and used this to power flying machines. These machines were propelled through the balancing of the energy and magnetism generated by the Earth and the Sun.
"The Great Crystal" was described as central to the Atlantean way of life, and was of an hexagonal shape with appendages which contained magnetic energy. When light passed through the crystal, it created an electro-magnetic power which, through the use of an antenna, could be used as a source of power. Crystals were also used for spiritual purposes, specifically as a tool to link the two hemispheres of the brain. This 'integrated mind' was able to directly access the Akashic records. Moreover, crystals also had a medicinal value: the sun's focused rays were refracted through crystals to cast different patterns onto the various diseased or affected areas of the body. The rays would rejuvenate failing cells, reversing the effects of aging. The misuse of crystal power is posited as part of the reason for the destruction of Atlantis. The power derived from crystals was claimed to have been manipulated by 'dark forces' and then used as a weapon. The overpowering of the crystal by hyper-focused energy from the sun caused cataclysmic events such as earthquakes.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus is said to have existed, but was born as a mortal who would later ascertain Christ consciousness, a spiritual attunement with the oneness of God. Although it has been suggested that there have been several figures who have acted with this consciousness, Jesus is described as causing the most significant change in man's thinking. Adam is presented as the first incarnation of Jesus, a figure who was sent to Earth to free beings who had become trapped within the world of the senses.
John Peniel and the Second Coming.
Solomon suggests that the second coming of Christ does not only relate to Jesus's return but also to the Christ consciousness which he possessed. The Second Coming is then portrayed as the birth of another person who, similar to Jesus, exemplifies the Christ consciousness. This person, who is referred to as John Peniel, will then cause those already living to elevate to an equal level, enabling them to achieve Christ consciousness. Solomon claims that Peniel is the reincarnation of John the Apostle and that his purpose is to end the duality and separation of man. Solomon has also suggested that Peniel will only appear on a global scale when confronted with the figure of the Antichrist. Confronting this Antichrist figure, he will help to reveal further aspects of Earth's history, as well as the history of pre-Earth events.
Solomon contends that Peniel is Jewish and lives in the East. As a child, he purportedly referred to himself as the reincarnation of King David. While Solomon uses the name John Peniel, this is not considered his true name. Although it appears he uses the name John, the surname Peniel was chosen because of its meaning, 'where I met Him face to face.' Presently, however, Peniel does not 'realize his own identity'. Solomon claim's that this will be revealed to him when he helps to open the Hall of Records. John Peniel's rise to international prominence is not given an exact date. Instead, it is posited as happening approximately 7 years after '2nd battle has begun to rage', an event caused by the actions of Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and the United States.
Hall of Records.
The Hall of Records is a legendary library which is currently inaccessible and is thought to be situated under the Great Sphinx of Giza. Supposedly, access to the Hall can only be realized when man discovers a way to allow solids to pass through one another, through inter-dimensional travel and the manipulation of spacetime rather than a literal movement of one solid through another. The Hall is said to contain information accrued by former civilizations on how to harness the natural energy of the Earth, thereby eliminating the need for fossil fuels. As well as housing descriptions of how to use crystals to magnify and implement the suns rays, The Hall is also home to artefacts from these former civilizations, such as their clothes, instruments, and food. Some of the foodstuffs no longer exist on Earth and are said to contain medicinal value.
The Profound Relaxation Experience (P.R.E.) table.
The readings suggested the construction of a table that would use sound as a means for relaxation and healing. Music at the rate of 60 beats per minute such as baroque music at largo tempo for relaxation was suggested. The speakers are placed beneath the mattress of this table, bringing the sound vibrations through the mattress to the body. The vibrations created by the table increase blood circulation and cause the breakup of the crystalline formations which are carried away by the body and eliminated.
The arresting hypothesis underpinning the creation of the device is that factors foreign to the body as germs viruses are only secondary to the condition of the muscular and skeletal system of the body. The readings identified building of calcium and mineral deposits around the joints as a major factor for stress and illness.
The table is not commercially available today, though some tables may still be in use.

Danmarksplass

Danmarksplass is a square in Årstad borough in the city of Bergen, Norway. Today most famous as one of Norway's busiest road intersections, it was originally known as "Kronstadtorget". After World War II, it received its current name in honour of Denmark's humanitarian efforts in Norway during the war. "Danmarksplass" is commonly used also to describe the immediate surroundings of the square, e.g. Krohnsminde kunstgressbane. Danmarksplass has more air pollution than anywhere else in Bergen, caused by the traffic as well as its location between two hills.
On an average, more than 60,000 vehicles pass through the at-grade intersection at Danmarksplass every day. European route E39, the main road into Bergen from both the south and the north, runs through Danmarksplass. Located near the city centre, Danmarksplass is a major thoroughfare for the tens of thousands of people who daily commute to work in the city centre or other boroughs.
The Bergen Light Rail line passes through Danmarksplass. The construction of the light rail line and stations, which was started in early 2008, lead to the closure of several lanes. Ibsens gate, the eastern arm of the intersection, was closed in August the same year.

Tom Orzechowski

Tom Orzechowski (born March 1, 1953) is an award-winning comic book letterer, primarily known for his work on "Uncanny X-Men". Over the course of Orzechowski's career, he has lettered something on the order of 6,000 pages of (long-time "X-Men" writer) Chris Claremont's scripts.
Biography.
Early career.
In 1968, when Orzechowski was 15, he met a group of aspiring comic book artists at the Detroit Triple Fan Fair comic convention in Detroit, and joined their comics club. Some older members of the club included future comics professionals Rich Buckler, Jim Starlin, Al Milgrom, and Mike Vosburg. An aspiring comic book artist, Orzechowski quit drawing when he saw their work. None of the club members wanted to letter their own amateur comics, however, so Orzechowski took on those jobs. 
Tony Isabella, who knew Orzechowski from the comics club, joined Marvel Comics in 1972, and soon got Orzechowski his first professional work, lettering retouches on the Marvel UK editions of classic "Fantastic Four", "Thor", "Hulk", "The Amazing Spider-Man", and "Daredevil" stories. Within a few months, Orzechowski had worked his way up to lettering for some of Marvel's black-and-white monster magazines. One of his first jobs of that kind was for "Monsters Unleashed", on one of the first Marvel stories written by future "X-Men" scribe Chris Claremont.
Orzechowski's connections from the comics club days paid off again when Rich Buckler pulled him over to letter "Black Panther (Jungle Action)", and Jim Starlin did the same for Starlin's run on "Captain Marvel".
Having moved to California by this time, Orzechowski lettered a number of underground comix titles in the mid-to-late 1970s.
"X-Men".
By the time of the debut of the New X-Men in "X-Men" #94, Orzechowski had developed a reputation as a "new projects guy," and was given the odd issue, and then with issue #122 (June 1979) finally the title. After a number of years on "X-Men" over Chris Claremont's scripts, the two men paired together on many future X-Men-related projects. (Orzechowski also designed the logos for "The New Mutants" and "Wolverine" comics, among others.) 
When all was said and done, counting "X-Men", many of its annuals, "The New Mutants", "Wolverine", "X-Treme X-Men", and "MekaniX", Orzechowksi lettered something on the order of 6,000 pages of Claremont's scripts over a 25-year period.
Post-"X-Men".
Orzechowski left the X-Men books shortly after Chris Claremont, in 1993. He joined the team putting out Image Comics' "Spawn" 1992, where his title was copy editor for most of the first six years. Orzechowski worked for the manga packaging outfit Studio Proteus from 1989 until their demise in 2004. Studio Proteus titles on which Orzechowski worked included "Nausicaä", "Appleseed", "", and "Ghost in the Shell". 
In the early 2000s, with many publishers beginning to use "in-house" lettering teams, freelancers like Orzechowski lost a lot of work. Though Orzechowski still does the occasional job for DC Comics and a manga company called Studio Cutie, he did not letter comic books regularly until 2009, when he started doing the lettering for Chris Claremont's "X-Men Forever" books, and in 2010 for the "New Mutants Forever" book, also written by Claremont. 
Lettering style and influences.
Orzechowski's letters are almost perfectly square, with the exception of the letter "I." Everything has a solid, uniform look to it. Letters stand straight up and down, not at a tilt. They are all painstakingly the same height. Similarly, Orzechowski's standard word balloon outlines are meticulously uniform. He also helped popularize non-standard (non-bubble-shaped) designs for word balloons, to reflect different character voices (square for robots, jagged/dripping for demons, etc.). In the mid-1970s, while Marvel’s production boss and cover letterer Dan Crespi was developing a tight, attractive house style, Orzechowski was 3,000 miles away in California, "buried in design books." Orzechowski figured that "since the "X-Men" didn’t overlap the rest of the Marvel Universe," there was no reason "not" to draw influences from calligraphy, record jackets, old movie posters — everything "except" comics.
Early influences on Orzechoswki's distinctive style included the work of Alphonse Mucha, and the comics lettering of Artie Simek and Abe Kanegson. Orzechowski modeled his lettering on the Flash Gordon newspaper strips of the 1930s. Another influence was Robert Crumb's "Zap Comix": Orzechowski recognized that Crumb’s title work was clearly derived from the brush techniques of that same era, the 1920s and '30s. Orzechowski studied everything of Crumb's (as well as the late 1960s DCs and Marvels), and developed a lettering style based on all of those influences. 
Computer lettering.
In 1992, Orzechowski was among the first letterers to experiment with computer fonts. Working on Studio Proteus's "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind", Orzechowski found the sound-effect work to be so demanding that computer lettering seemed like a way to save time on the extensive dialogue. His font program, however, was primitive, and he ended up doing that series entirely by hand after all. By 1994, however, Orzechowksi was lettering mainly on the computer, and in 2002 he switched completely to digital lettering, using a Wacom pen on a graphics tablet, in Adobe Illustrator. He explained in a 2003 interview on Comicon.com's "The Pulse" that "even then I was losing the knack, as the majority of my work had been digital for a couple of years. The fine motor control slips if the muscles aren’t in continual use."
Personal life.
Orzechoswki is not related to comics artist/designer Bob Orzechowski.
Orzechowski lives in Portland, Oregon, where he operates a typography and logo design studio. His "life partner" is L. Lois Buhalis, herself a letterer in the comics industry for two decades.

Major Adam Charles Muir (1770 – 11 May 1829) was an officer in the British Army, who played a significant but little-known role in the Anglo-American War of 1812.
Muir was born in Scotland. The date is not definitely known; it may have been 1766 or 1770. He enlisted as a private soldier in the 41st Regiment of Foot in 1778. He was evidently well-educated and very quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a Sergeant in only five months and later Sergeant-Major, and being commissioned as an Adjutant in 1793. He became an Ensign shortly afterwards, and was promoted to Lieutenant the next year. He served with the regiment in the West Indies.
In 1799, the regiment was posted to Canada. In 1801, Muir married Mary Elizabeth Alexowina Bender in Montreal. The couple would eventually have ten children. Muir was promoted to Captain in 1804. In 1811, the regiment, noted by Major-General Isaac Brock as being one of the steadiest units available in Canada, was sent to Upper Canada.
In 1812, when war with America broke out, Muir was in charge of the detachment of the regiment at Amherstburg. In this part of the province, there were few British troops, but large numbers of Indians inspired by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh aided the British. Muir was present at the Battle of Brownstown where Indians under Tecumseh routed an American detachment and captured vital despatches. Shortly afterwards, he commanded British troops and Indians at the Battle of Maguaga. Muirs troops were forced to retreat, but rallied, and the Americans withdrew without accomplishing their mission which was to clear a route for supplies to reach their army at Detroit.
Muir was wounded at Maguaga, but recovered to lead the main body of the 41st at the Siege of Detroit. Later in the year, Muir commanded another detachment sent to aid the Indians attacking Fort Wayne, Indiana. The attack failed, but Muir retreated successfully to Detroit. During the following year, he took part in the Battles of Frenchtown, Fort Meigs and Fort Stephenson. He was one of several officers who became critical of the leadership of the commander of the division, Major General Henry Procter. Finally, he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Moraviantown, when the by now starving and demoralised 41st Regiment gave way before a charge of Kentucky mounted riflemen.
After some months in captivity, Muir was released by an exchange of prisoners. He was promoted Brevet Major in 1814, and was appointed to command the militia in the Grand River district on the Niagara Peninsula, and played a small part in the Battle of Malcolm's Mills.
After the war, the 41st returned to Britain. Muir was crippled by a fall from a horse in Ireland in 1816. He resigned from the Army two years later and returned to take up land in Lower Canada. He was forced to sell his farm and retired to an invalid hospital at William Henry, where he died in 1829, leaving large debts.

John Goodwin Lyman

John Goodwin Lyman (29 September 1886 — 26 May 1967) was an American-born Canadian modernist painter active largely in Montreal. In the 1930s he did much to promote modern art in Canada, founding the Contemporary Art Society in 1939. Stylistically he opposed both the Group of Seven and the Canadian Group of Painters, painting in a more "refined" style influenced by the School of Paris.
Biography.
Formative Years (1886-1913).
Lyman was born in Biddeford, Maine. His parents were Americans who emigrated to Victoria, B.C., and moved to Montreal around the time that he was born. As their house was in the process of being built, Mrs. Lyman spent the fall of 1886 at her parents' house in Biddeford, Maine, where she gave birth. She died shortly before John's second birthday. Lyman's family was financially well-off, which would allow him to travel substantially and devote the entirety of his time to art.
After spending two years at McGill University, Lyman departed for Paris in spring of 1907, where he studied art until the fall, when at his father's urging he returned to study architecture at the Royal College of Art. January of next year found him back in Paris, where he studied at Académie Julian under Laurens. There he formed a friendship with fellow Canadian James Wilson Morrice. Lyman enrolled at the Academie Matisse in the fall of 1909, which he left due to illness the next spring, returning to Montreal in the summer of 1910. Despite the brevity of his encounter with the master, Matisse would be a primary influence upon Lyman in the years to come.
That summer he married Corrine St. Pierre, and the two spent the next two years traveling intermittently in France. Upon his return to Montreal he exhibited four Fauve inspired works in the spring exhibit of the Art Academy of Montreal, which were met with great vitriol in the conservative press of Quebec. Another exhibit of forty-two oil paintings, his first one man show, opened on May twenty-first and received a similar reaction.
Years of Exile (1913-31).
Due to his rejection in his native country, Lyman and his wife spent twenty-eight peripatetic years living in France, Spain, and North Africa. He bought a villa in Southern France in 1922, where he corresponded with Matisse. In October 1927 he briefly returned to Montreal for the opening of his second one man show. The Great Depression lessened his income, forcing him to return to Montreal in 1931.
Return to Montreal (1931-1948).
A third one man show was held in Montreal in February 1931. In November of that year Lyman began his attempts to bring European ideas of modern art to Canada with the opening of his Atelier, an academy-style school of art, established under the auspices of McGill University. It closed after just over a year due to lack of profit. In 1936 he began to write a column on art for The Montrealer that ran through 1942. The years 1936-39 saw three more one man shows, including one in New York City in May 1937.
In 1938 Lyman began to gather together Montreal painters who were disillusioned with the Canadian Group and The Group of Seven, and in December of that year they exhibited together as The Eastern Group of Painters. The Contemporary Arts Society was formally organized in January 1939, with Lyman as its first president. Through this body he organized exhibits of modern European art in Montreal, the first of which, titled "Art of Our Day" opened in May 1939. It included work by Kandinsky, Derain, and Modigliani. The first exhibit of the group was held in December 1939. By 1948 the CAS was rent by opposing factions with Paul-Emile Borduas and Alfred Pellan at their heads. After Borduas' election as president of the group in 1948, Pellan withdrew his group from the society, upon which Borduas resigned. Lyman, seeing that the CAS could no longer effectively fulfill its purpose, made a motion to dissolve the body. This was accepted at a meeting on November 18, 1948.
Later Years (1948-1967).
Lyman continued to paint figures in the years following the dissolution of the CAS, but the avant garde had shifted to the Automatism of Borduas and pure abstraction. In 1949 he accepted a professorship at McGill University, becoming the director of the fine arts department in 1952. He died, aged 80, in Christ Church, Barbados.
Work.
Matisse, and other Fauvist painters, were the primary influence upon Lyman's work. His paintings were among the first in this style to be exhibited in Quebec, and his exhibit openings were met with derision in the popular press. In the 1920s, however, Lyman's work was more readily accepted. This was partly because of greater public exposure to modern art from Europe, and partly because of a change in Lyman's painting style.
While strongly influenced by Fauvism, Lyman's work is characterized by an "emotional reserve" and "psychological distance" out of keeping with that movement. His mature work does not stray far from Matisse in terms of subject matter (portraits, nudes, etc.), but displays relatively muted colors and smooth paint-handling.
"Woman With a White Collar" especially shows this mixture of Fauvist influence with Lyman's "calm, classical" personal style. It can be compared with similar portraits by Matisse in its handling of the facial planes and the somewhat arbitrary use of color, but displays a "prim and static elegance" in its contrast of the solidly formed head against the neutral background.

Khalid Amayreh

Khalid Amayreh (, b. 1957 Hebron) is a Palestinian journalist based in Dura, near Hebron.
Conflict with the Palestinian Authority.
Amayreh is barred from leaving the West Bank. For many years Amayreh was confined to his home village of Dura near Hebron by the Israeli military occupation authorities. The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group issued reports and press releases relevant to the harassment of Amayreh by both Israel and Palestinian authorities.
On 22 January 2009, Amayreh was arrested by the police forces of the Palestinian Authority (PA). He was questioned and imprisoned in a blacked-out room for two days. The PA stated the reason for his arrest was not his reporting about financial corruption in the PA but suspicion of affiliation with Hamas. Others state the reason for his arrest was his statements about the collaborationist nature of the PA during the 2008–2009 Gaza War. He was released due to a mass outcry and protest at his arrest.
He was once again harassed on several occasions by the PA beginning in January 2012. The purpose of the continuous harassment is not totally clear, but it might have something to do with the PA's declared hostility against Hamas and any of its sympathizers. 
Views and opinions.
In 2008, Amayreh stated that "It is well known that Israel, through the numerous Zionist lobbies and pressure groups, more or less controls America's politics, media and financial institutions…. But America doesn't lack the brain power to know the facts and find out the truth about the umbilical connection between the Israeli factor and the ravaging financial crisis now facing the US… I am afraid there will be more bad news in this regard if America doesn't reclaim its liberty from the Zionist Robber Barons who have come to tightly control the American financial establishment." This article was picked up by many other blogs, Web sites, and listserves.
In 2010, Amayreh described Helen Thomas and Fidel Castro as the "elderly targets" of "Zionist supremacists from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles", supporting calls for Jewish invaders to return to Poland and their "native homelands".

<doc id="18503313" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18503313" title="Hans Weiditz">
Hans Weiditz

Hans Weiditz the Younger, Hans Weiditz der Jüngere, Hans Weiditz II (1495 Freiburg im Breisgau - c1537 Bern), was a German Renaissance artist, also known as The Petrarch Master for his woodcuts illustrating Petrarch's "De remediis utriusque fortunae", or "Remedies for Both Good and Bad Fortune", or "Phisicke Against Fortune". He is best known today for his very lively scenes and caricatures of working life and people, many created to illustrate the abstract philosophical maxims of Cicero and Petrarch. 
Like most artists in woodcut he only designed the woodcuts, leaving the block-cutting to a specialist "formschneider" (sometimes Jost de Negker in his Augsburg period) who pasted the design to the wood and chiselled the white areas away. The quality of the final woodcuts, which varies considerably, depended on the skill of the cutter as well as the artist. Weiditz was unfortunate in that his publishers went bankrupt part way through the production of his two longest series of woodcuts, and the cutting was later completed by cutters of lower skill. 
Life.
His father, Hans Weiditz the Elder, Hans Weiditz dem Älteren, Hans Weiditz I (c1475 Straßburg - c1516 Straßburg), worked in Freiburg between 1497 and 1514, and was described as a 'bildhower' or sculptor in the Painters' Guild records. In 1505 he worked on the "Dreikönigsaltar" in Freiburg Cathedral. Parish records show a 1510 payment to him for carved wooden rosettes on the keystones in the chancel, working with Hans Baldung, the gifted student of Albrecht Dürer. He is not to be confused with the slightly older Strasbourg woodcut artist Hans Wechtlin. 
Weiditz the Younger, a brother of Christoph Weiditz (1500-1559), was a prominent member of an elite group of woodcut artists including such figures as Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein, and Hans Burgkmair, his teacher. He was active in Augsburg between 1512 and 1522, and from 1522 to 1536 in Straßburg, producing woodcuts for book illustrations in the style of Burgkmair. He also produced notable work for an edition of Cicero's popular "De Officiis" in 1531, for Apuleius' "The Golden Ass" (1538), and the "Comedies" of Plautus. 
He produced the German chiaroscuro woodcut with the most different colour blocks, a seven-block coat of arms of a cardinal, for a book frontispiece of 1520, probably cut by Jost de Negker.
Illustrations for the "Herbarum vivae eicones".
The "Herbarum vivae eicones" (Living plant images), published in Strasbourg in three parts between 1530 and 1536, was a landmark publication in the development of botanical illustration. The text was compiled by Otto Brunfels from earlier writings, but the illustrations by Weiditz represented a novel approach and set a high standard of realism in the portrayal of plants. Weiditz took his plants from nature, often showing the changing appearance with the seasons. His technique was admired and inevitably copied, leading to a copyright infringement lawsuit against the publisher Christian Egenolff.

Tempe High School (Tempe, Arizona)

Tempe High School is located in Tempe, Arizona, approximately one mile south of Arizona State University.
History.
Tempe Union High School was established by a vote of the people of Tempe in 1908. It was required, as the Normal School in Tempe (now ASU) no longer would enroll students with 8th-grade diplomas. Classes were held in rented space in downtown Tempe for the 1908-09 school year, as the school's permanent location was built. The first building opened in the fall of 1909 on the southeast corner of Mill and University (today the Tempe Towne Center, the town's first strip mall).
Kemper Goodwin, a prominent local architect, would go on to graduate from Tempe High in the mid-1920s, then design its current campus in the 1950s. Games were played at Goodwin Stadium, the home of the ASU Sun Devils until 1957, and in the 1920s, the two teams played against each other on numerous occasions. It was not until 1969 that Tempe High's campus hosted football games.
In 1953, the current Tempe High School opened with the administration and library buildings; three classroom units; and the cafeteria. (These are now buildings B through F). The gymnasium and auditorium remained at the former site for two more years until both burned down in 1955, both to clear the land for construction of Tempe Towne Center and to provide practice for the fire department. The "modular site" was fleshed out by the end of the 1960s.
Explosion of enrollment.
Tempe expanded tremendously during the 1950s and 1960s. It grew so overcrowded at Tempe High School that double sessions were featured during the fall of 1964. The evening sessions were titled McClintock High School (they eventually moved to their own campus in January 1965).
Both Tempe and McClintock would share a defining rivalry in Tempe sports. Their football and basketball games, due to heightened interest, often wound up on ASU's campus and fields.
Today.
Tempe High's enrollment generally ranges between 1,300 and 1,400 students. THS offers a wide variety of curriculum, including an honors Curriculum, the International Baccalaureate program, and H.O.P.E. which allows students to explore and train for medical professions by partnership with Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital.
Centennial.
During the 2007-08 school year, Tempe High celebrated its 100th anniversary, beginning with a Centennial Homecoming Celebration. To celebrate this momentous occasion, a Centennial Committee was formed under the wing of the Tempe High Buffalo Foundation. The Buffalo Foundation is the prime alumni organization for Tempe High School. This organization helps preserve the proud traditions and history of Tempe High and serves as an alumni resource for reunions and fundraising events.
Centennial events included: Athletic Hall of Fame dinner, Homecoming parade down Mill Avenue, Back to the Future celebration, and the Embassy Suites Blue and White Bash.
Athletics.
The Buffaloes have won three state championship titles since Tempe varsity football began in 1924. The first came in 1956, when Tempe High went undefeated with a 10-0 record under coach John Zucco. Between 1954 and 1957, Coach Zucco led the Buffaloes to a 32-6-1 record that included an 18-game winning streak. The Buffaloes' second championship came in 1989, when they shared the 4A title with Agua Fria. In the final playoff game in Sun Devil Stadium, which was attended by more than 11,000 fans, the Buffaloes and the Owls fought to a 10-10 draw. The tie game capped a 13-1-1 season under second-year coach Jim Murphy. The Buffaloes last state championship came with a win at the 4A state championship in 1996, beating Glendale Ironwood 20-17 in an overtime thriller. The Buffaloes won by a touchdown pass from Todd Mortensen to Justin Taplin. This victory capped a perfect 14-0 season, led by Tim McBurney. 
In 1989 one of the greatest football games was played between the two schools, more than 10,000 fans were in attendance to watch Tempe High defeat McClintock 25-24. Both teams went on to claim state championships that year.

John Frederick Boyce Combe

Major-General John Frederick Boyce Combe CB DSO & Bar (1 August 1895 – 12 July 1967) was a British Army officer before and during World War II. He was twice awarded the DSO for his service in the Western Desert Campaign before being captured in April 1941 and spending nearly two and a half years as a prisoner of war in Italy. Released in September 1943 when Italy withdrew from the Axis, he made his way back to Allied territory and from October 1944 until the end of the war commanded an amoured brigade.
Early life.
John Frederick Boyce Combe was the son of Captain Christian Combe and Lady Jane Seymour Conyngham.
In 1914, Combe joined the B Squadron of the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert’s Own).
World War II.
Lieutenant Colonel Combe was the commanding officer of the 11th Hussars for the initial stages of the Western Desert Campaign during World War II. He had been promoted lieutenant-colonel to take command in September 1939 and was partly responsible for the high level of training that prepared the regiment for the battles in North Africa. Under Combe's command, the regiment played a part during the early British raids into Libya and as part of the cover force for the Western Desert Force (WDF) during the Italian invasion of Egypt. The 11th Hussars were part of the divisional troops of the WDF's 7th Armoured Division
Combe Force.
Combe played a major part in the defeat of the Italian Tenth Army during Operation Compass. He was appointed to command an "ad hoc" mobile flying column known as "Combe Force," comprising a squadron of 11 Hussars, B Squadron 1st King's Dragoon Guards, C Battery Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), some anti-tank guns from 106th Regiment RHA and the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade. In February 1941, Combe and "Combe Force" cut off the retreating Italians at Beda Fomm. The Italians were forced to halt and in spite very determined attempts over two days, were unable to break through Combe Force's defensive lines. Unable to move forward and picked off by attacks from their flank by 4th Armoured Brigade and from the rear by the 7th Support Group, the bulk of the Tenth Army surrendered. Some 25,000 prisoners were taken and more than 100 medium tanks as well as over 100 guns were destroyed or captured.
Prisoner of War.
Combe was promoted to temporary brigadier on 3 April 1941, handing over command of the 11th Hussars to Lieutenant Colonel W. I. Leetham. As a result of Erwin Rommel's advance from El Agheila, he was appointed by the Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command, Archibald Wavell, to accompany another desert-experienced officer, Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor (the former commander of the Western Desert Force which had become the XIII Corps) as adviser to Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame, the commander of HQ Cyrenaica Command (the successor to XIII Corps). On the night of 6 April 1941, Combe was travelling by car with Neame and O'Connor from their Advanced HQ at Msus to its new location at Tmimi. They were captured by the Germans and taken to mainland Italy to be held as prisoners of war (POW).
He was initially sent to the Villa Orsini near Sulmona in the Abruzzo, where he was amongst other distinguished officers, apart from Neame and O'Connor they included, Air Marshall Owen Tudor Boyd, and Major-General Adrian Carton de Wiart. He was later transferred to another camp, Castello di Vincigliata PG12 near Florence. He settled into camp life becoming one of the gardeners, as well as keeping sixteen hens, ‘and tended them like a mother.’. He was an enthusiastic escaper, taking it turns in tunnelling and one of the six officers to escape in April 1943. Unfortunately he was caught the next morning in Milan railway station, whilst studying a timetable.
Partisans in Italy.
He escaped from Vincigliata again with all remaining officers and men during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. He reached Camaldoli with Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Neame, Lieutenant-General Sir Richard O'Connor and other British officers. In Romagna, he joined the Italian partisans led by Libero as Riccardo Fedel was known. During the winter of 1943/4 this partisan group helped Combe and other allied prisoners to escape. They included Brigadier ‘Rudolf’ Vaughan, Brigadier ‘Ted’ Todhunter, Captain Guy Ruggles-Brise and Lieutenant ‘Dan’ Ranfurly. In March 1944 with the help of Italian guides they made an astonishing 250 mile walk across the mountains in snow to keep a rendezvous with agents on the coast. The group acquired a leaking fishing boat and eventually arrived at Allied lines in May 1944. Combe arrived in Algiers 12 May with Todhunter and Ranfurly and was flown to England.
Back with Eighth Army.
After his escape Combe re-joined Eighth Army. In October 1944 he was given command of 2nd Armoured Brigade (which position he held until after the German surrender) and had his substantive (permanent) rank advanced from lieutenant-colonel to colonel.
Post war.
After the end of hostilities in Europe Combe had brief periods as an acting major-general commanding successively 78th Infantry Division and 46th Infantry Division in Austria. In October 1946 his rank of major-general was made permanent and he was appointed Deputy GOC British Troops Austria. He retired from the army in October 1947 but continued to hold the ceremonial post of "Colonel of the Regiment" of the 11th Hussars to which he had been appointed in July 1945 and was to hold for twelve years. It was as Colonel of the Regiment that he took part in the procession behind the coffin at the funeral of King George VI in 1952. He died on 12 July 1967.
Marriage.
On 21 July 1947, Combe married Helen Violet St. Maur, daughter of Major Lord Percy St. Maur and Hon. Violet White.

Gautier de Dargies

Gautier de Dargies (ca. 1170 – ca. 1240) was a trouvère from Dargies. He was one of the most prolific of the early trouvères; possibly twenty-five of his lyrics survive, twenty-two with accompanying melodies, in sixteen separate "chansonniers." He was a major influence on contemporary and later trouvères, and one of the most recorded of medieval vernacular composers. Seventeen "chansons courtoises" can be assigned indubitably to Gautier, fifteen with music, and three more are probably his, all with music. He imported the Occitan genre of the "descort" into Old French and left behind three "descorts" with their melodies. He also participated in two "jeux partis", but only one with music. His theme everywhere was courtly love.
Gautier appears in documents of the years 1195, 1202, and 1206 as a "vavasour." By 1236, his latest appearance in documents, he had achieved the rank of a knight. His military career is obscure, but he probably participated in the Third Crusade when a young man in 1189. Gautier was the son of Sagalo, himself a younger son or scion of a cadet branch of the Dargies family, since Gautier's coat of arms, depicted in the "Chansonnier du Roi" and the "Chansonnier d'Arras" both display martlets of gules not sable, the sign of the main branch of a family. Gautier had three brothers—Rainaut, Drogo, and Villardus—and a wife, Agnes. He apparently knew Gace Brulé, whom he mentions in three poems.
As a poet and musician, Gautier demonstrates skill and originality in his handling of traditional themes, especially metrically. He experiments with asymmetry and lengthiness. Melodically, he is highly individual. Four of his melodies are non-repetitive; in two the musical phrase lengths differ from the lyric phrase lengths, and in all of his surviving pieces he is not constrained to an octave. One melodic setting of his song "Se j’ai esté lonc tens hors du päis" has the largest range of any surviving medieval lyric, the highest note lying a full two octaves above the final.

George Staller

George Walborn Staller (April 1, 1916 – July 3, 1992) was an American outfielder, scout and coach in Major League Baseball. He served as first base coach on Earl Weaver's Baltimore Orioles staff from 1968 to 1975, working on the Orioles' three consecutive American League championship teams (1969-70-71) and Baltimore's 1970 World Series champion.
Career.
Born in Rutherford Heights, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, Staller threw and batted left-handed and stood (180 cm) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). He originally signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1937 and progressed as far as the top-level Montreal Royals in 1940-41, where he led the International League in doubles (40) and triples (12) in 1940. But his only major league service occurred in 1943, when he was purchased by the Philadelphia Athletics from the minor league version of the Baltimore Orioles after leading the 1943 IL in runs batted in (with 98). Staller appeared in 21 games with the 1943 A's, batting .271 with 23 hits in 85 at bats, including three home runs and 12 RBI. He then joined the armed forces in 1944-45.
Staller was a minor league manager for 14 seasons, 1948 through 1961. He began in the A's system (1948–53), then moved with Philadelphia general manager Arthur Ehlers to the American League Orioles organization in its first season in Baltimore, 1954. Staller reached the Triple-A level for one season, in 1960 with the Vancouver Mounties; his career managing record was 922 wins, 1,043 losses (.469).
Staller's first term as an Orioles coach came in 1962, when he served one year under skipper Billy Hitchcock. Then, after 5½ seasons as a Baltimore scout, he rejoined the Orioles staff when Weaver was promoted from first-base coach to manager in July 1968. Staller served until his retirement from the field at the close of the 1975 season. He was listed as a scout for the Seattle Mariners for the expansion team's inaugural American League season, 1977. George Staller died at age 76 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Nikephoros Phokas the Elder

Nikephoros Phokas the Elder (, "Nikēphoros Phōkas") (c. 830 – c. 896/900) was one of the most prominent Byzantine generals of the late 9th century, and the first important member of the Phokas family. He had a distinguished military career in southern Italy, where his victories laid the foundation for the Byzantine resurgence, and led successful campaigns against the Arabs in the eastern borderlands as well as against the Bulgarians of Tsar Simeon.
Life.
Nikephoros was the son of the founder of the Phokas family, a middle-ranking military officer ("tourmarches") from Cappadocia named Phokas, attested ca. 872.
Nikephoros began his military career under Emperor Basil I the Macedonian (reigned 867–886), probably at the same time as his father was appointed to the post of "tourmarches" (ca. 872). Nikephoros was originally appointed to the guard corps of the "Manglabitai", and possibly participated in Basil's 873 campaign against Samosata. Shortly after, at any rate before 878, Nikephoros was promoted to the rank of "protostrator" and the post of commanding general ("strategos") of the theme of Charsianon.
Nikephoros made his name as the Byzantine commander-in-chief ("monostrategos", "single-general") against the Arabs in southern Italy, a post to which he was appointed in late 885, or, according to Shaun Tougher, after the accession of Leo VI the Wise in July 886. His command involved the forces of several western themes (Thrace, Macedonia, Cephallenia, Longobardia and Calabria), and lasted until his recall to Constantinople, probably in 887. As a reward for his successes in Italy, he was raised to the rank of "patrikios" and named to the post of Domestic of the Schools, in effect commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army. 
Little is known of his activities over the next few years and until the outbreak of war with Bulgaria in 894. An undated report of a successful raid into the Arab lands of Cilicia led by Nikephoros probably dates to this period. In 895, he was sent against the Bulgarians at the head of a large army. It is unclear whether Nikephoros engaged the Bulgarians in battle, for a Byzantine-instigated invasion by the Magyars from the north, and the activities of the Byzantine navy in the Danube, forced the Bulgarian ruler Simeon to ask for a truce, and the Byzantines withdrew. 
This is the last campaign associated with Nikephoros Phokas, and some chroniclers report that he died in 895/896. His death reportedly encouraged Simeon to reopen hostilities, with devastating success against Nikephoros' successor as Domestic, Leo Katakalon. The later chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus, however, reports a different story, according to which Nikephoros was disgraced and dismissed from is post after refusing proposals for a marriage alliance with Leo's powerful chief minister, Stylianos Zaoutzes. Nikephoros was then appointed "strategos" of the Thracesian Theme, spending his remaining years until his death around 900 fighting against the Arabs. This account is largely rejected by modern scholars.
By all accounts, Nikephoros Phokas was a capable soldier. Leo VI lauds his military talents in his "Tactica", and he is credited with the invention of a weapon to counter cavalry during his campaign against the Bulgarians, consisting of a sharpened stake driven into the ground.
Nikephoros was the father of Bardas Phokas the Elder and Leo Phokas the Elder, both of whom became Domestics of the Schools, and through Bardas the grandfather of Nikephoros II Phokas, general and emperor in 963–969, and of Leo Phokas the Younger.

Antigone (daughter of Eurytion)

In Greek mythology, Antigone was the daughter of Eurytion and wife of Peleus.
Peleus and Telamon, his brother, killed their half-brother Phocus and fled Aegina to escape punishment. In Phthia, Peleus was purified by Eurytion and married Antigone, Eurytion's daughter. Peleus accidentally killed Eurytion during the hunt for the Calydonian Boar and fled Phthia.
Peleus was purifed of the murder of Eurytion in Iolcus by Acastus. Also in Iolcus, Peleus lost a wrestling match in the funeral games of Pelias, Acastus' father, to Atalanta. Astydameia, Acastus' wife, fell in love with Peleus but he scorned her. Bitter, she sent a messenger to Antigone to falsely tell her that Peleus was to marry Acastus' daughter; Antigone hanged herself. (Apollodorus, iii. 13).
Astydameia then told Acastus that Peleus had tried to rape her. Acastus took Peleus on a hunting trip and hid his sword, then abandoned him right before a group of centaurs attacked. Chiron, the wise centaur, returned Peleus' sword and Peleus managed to escape. He pillaged Iolcus and dismembered Astydameia, then marched his army between the pieces.

Charles James Melrose

Charles James (Jimmy) Melrose (13 September 1913 – 5 July 1936) was an Australian aviator who held a number of flying records, was the youngest and only solo flier to finish the Melbourne (Macrobertson) Centenary Air Race in 1934. He flew a DH80A Puss Moth named 'My Hildergarde' to England just after his 21st birthday in order to compete in the race, reaching Croydon in just over 8 days. That in itself was an unofficial record and astounded everyone. Then in November 1935 he was again returning to Australia in a Percival Gull Four when he helped in the unsuccessful search for Sir Charles Kingsford Smith around the Bay of Bengal. Melrose had been the last person to sight Kingsford Smith's Lockheed Altair in the night air as it flew above him.
On his return from the Air Race Melrose was considering giving up racing and turning his mind to commencing an air taxi service the likes of which were virtually non-existent in the mid-1930s.
Death.
He died in July 1936, at the age of 22, when his new high-wing monoplane, a Heston Phoenix, broke up in turbulence over South Melton, Victoria on a charter flight from Darwin to Melbourne. His unfortunate passenger was Lt Col Alexander George Campbell, DSO and mining manager. Two days later, over one hundred thousand people lined the streets of Melbourne to pay their last respects to this fine young flier.
Legacy.
Melrose Park in New South Wales and Melrose Park in South Australia are both suburbs named after him, as well as James Melrose Road, which travels along the southern boundary of Adelaide Airport. The town of Mildenhall, Suffolk, UK, where the 1934 Air Race originated, has also named a street after him - Charles Melrose Close.

Grünfeld Defence, Nadanian Variation

The Nadanian Variation (sometimes called the Nadanian Attack) of the Grünfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
The Nadanian Variation is classified in the "Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings" (ECO) with the code D85.
History.
The variation is named after the Armenian International Master Ashot Nadanian, who first employed it in 1996. His analysis was published in the 67th volume of Chess Informant.
The birth of the variation has caused major ripples in the chess world. One of the world's most authoritative chess editions "New in Chess Yearbook" printed on the front cover of the 45th volume the following: "A Revolution in the Gruenfeld: 5.Na4!?!". Grandmaster Jonathan Rowson wrote in his book "Understanding the Grünfeld" that Nadanian "should be congratulated for seeing what everyone has seen, and thinking what nobody had thought".
The famous chess theoretician, Grandmaster Igor Zaitsev in "64" Russian chess magazine wrote:The continuation 5.Nа4 of Armenian chess player Nadanian shakes by the extraordinariness. Yes, extraordinariness, because it is unusual among the unusual. A voluntary removal of the knight from the centre, yet that has gone on advantage? Therefore, the value of such centrifugal maneuver is beyond a simple theoretical novelty, in a certain measure it is a challenge to chess foundations, an attempt to grope new properties in two-dimensional chess space.
Theory.
White's fifth move is overprotecting the key c5-square in the Grünfeld Defence, thus aspires to prevent an attack on the pawn centre by c7–c5. The extravagancy of White's idea is that they break at once two opening principles: avoid moving the same piece twice, and avoid placing a knight on the edge of the board. However, according to Nadanian, the position after the fifth move is an exception to the rules. By placing the knight on а4, White takes under control the critical square c5, and by next move 6.e4 will return a tempo back, as Black too will play an already developed piece (knight on d5).
White should aspire to the following arrangement: e4, Be3, Be2, Nf3, 0-0, Rc1, Nc5. Black in turn should not allow this scheme for what it is necessary for them to put pressure on the d4 pawn.
The main line continues 5...Bg7 6.e4 Nb6 (Avrukh's 6...Nb4 is also interesting) 7.Be3 0-0 8.Nf3 Bg4 (instead 8...Nxa4 9.Qxa4 c5 10.Rd1 Qb6 11.Rd2 was good for White in Korchnoi–Sutovsky, Dresden 1998) 9.Be2 Nc6 10.d5 Ne5 11.Nxe5 Bxe2 12.Qxe2 Nxa4 with approximately equal chances.
Another possible line is 5...e5 6.dxe5 Nc6 (suggested by Igor Zaitsev and first played by Mikhalchishin), which is according to Lubomir Kavalek "perhaps the only way to punish the white knight's venture to the edge of the board". After 7.a3 (Nadanian's idea) 7...Bf5 8.Nf3 Qd7 9.e3 0-0-0 10.Be2 (Eingorn gives 10.Bb5 Qe6) 10...Qe7 11.Qb3 Bg7 according to Yelena Dembo Black has a powerful initiative (Kantsler–Avrukh, Israel 1999).
Use.
The variation's most devoted practitioner has been its eponym, Ashot Nadanian. Various famous players such as Swiss Grandmaster Viktor Korchnoi, Chinese Super-grandmaster Bu Xiangzhi, American GM Walter Browne, Scottish GM Jonathan Rowson, Russian GM Andrei Kharlov, Israeli GM Vitali Golod and Croatian GM Bogdan Lalić have employed it at some time or another, though few have made it their main line against the Grünfeld Defence.
Modified versions.
There are also modified versions of Nadanian's idea.

Encounters Of Every Kind is an album by Meco, released in 1978. It was recorded after the success of Meco's platinum-selling album "Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk" and contains two sides of linked songs. In contrast to the previous album (which dedicated a full side to the music from "Star Wars") and contrary to an album title that suggests a similar focus on the music from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", this album is actually made up of songs from a number of different popular movies, with no special focus on any particular film. (Meco would return to this format for his 1982 album "Pop Goes the Movies".) The music from "Close Encounters" only appears at the very end of the album.
"Encounters of Every Kind" was the last Meco album to gain significant prominence on the Billboard charts, though he continued to record film tie-ins with disco-inspired albums for "The Wizard of Oz", "Superman & Other Galactic Heroes" (a tie-in with "Superman The Movie", which was another John Williams score) and 'Music From Star Trek & Music From The Black Hole" (tie-ins with the 1979 films ' and "The Black Hole"). None of these releases other than the "Star Wars" album have been released on CD, though some tracks from "Close Encounters" were available on the "Best of Meco" compact disc.

The band derives from the so-called "student music", popular in Poland. This musical style is characterised by the use of a guitar for accompaniment, while the lyrics often talk about hiking in the Polish mountains, love and adventure. SDM, however, quickly created their own style, and became famous due to their interesting musical interpretations of poems written by the famous Polish poet Edward Stachura. Another important author, who worked with the band, is the Polish poet Adam Ziemianin.

Debtors' Prison (Accomac, Virginia)

The Debtors' Prison is a historic debtors' prison in Accomac, Virginia. Constructed in 1783 as a house for the Accomack County jailer, it is the oldest public structure in the county. It was converted to use as a debtors' prison in 1824, which purpose it served until 1849. The prison was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places in 1976; along with structures in Worsham and Tappahannock, both in Virginia as well, it is one of only three debtors' prisons in the country on the National Register.
History.
The structure that stands today in central Accomac, not far from the Accomack County Courthouse, is the last survivor of a complex which initially included both a jail and a jailyard. In 1775 the Accomack County court ordered a committee to "plan and lay off a
Draught for a new prison for this County." Construction was completed on the building itself in 1782, in which year an inspection committee approved of it, but recommended "that a suitable wall made of Brick around
the Gaol at a convenient distance is absolutely necessary and that there ought to be a small house built at the public expense in one corner and adjoining the said wall for the residence of the jailor, without which we are of opinion that the prisoners cannot be kept in perfect security." The county accepted these additions to the complex in 1784. In 1969 archaeological work was undertaken by the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission in the vicinity of the debtors' prison. This revealed that the complex as completed in 1784 was seventy feet square and contained within a brick wall. The jail was in the northeast corner of the square; the surviving jailor's house formed part of the yard's south wall, and was located at the west corner. The contractor for the initial construction project was listed as one Selby Simpson.
By the first decades of the nineteenth century the jailer's house was already sorely in need of repair, and consequently the county began to study the possibility of finding an alternative use for the property. At around the same time a state law had been passed requiring provision of separate facilities for debtors and felons. Thus, in 1824 a committee that was set up by the county court reminded that body that the law did not actually require the county to provide quarters for a jailer; furthermore, such an arrangement was highly unusual, if not unheard-of, in any other county in Virginia. Consequently, it was recommended that the house be reappropriated and reconfigured to serve as a debtors' prison, especially as it was thought that the proximity of the jailor's house to the jail posed a security risk. The committee held that little work needed to be done to convert the jail to its new purpose, saying "that iron bars to the windows of inch iron and oak Batton doors to be hung outside, is all that is necessary to be done to the said house, to answer the purposes intended, because it is believed that debtors have no inducement to brake prison, the Law authorizes them with little trouble to discharge themselves whenever they wish so to do." The conversion was finished quickly, and the house served in its new capacity until 1849, when imprisonment for debt was discontinued in Virginia. The old jail and wall were demolished by the county in 1909; the debtors' prison was turned over to the Drummondtown Branch of Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities). That organization undertook a partial renovation of the property in 1911, revisiting it for a fuller restoration in 1953. From 1911 until 1927 the building was used as a library; today it is a museum of local history, and is furnished to represent a typical middle class home of the eighteenth century. The Accomac debtors' prison was surveyed by the Historic American Buildings Survey between 1958 and 1961, when it was found to be in good condition; the formal report was placed on file in 1961.
Design.
Physically, the debtors' prison is a small building, measuring 18' by 30'; it is one story in height, three bays in length, and constructed of Flemish bond brick with glazed headers. Originally, the house formed the southwest corner of a 70-foot-square jailyard, and a small portion of the yard's original brick wall can still be seen projecting from the northeast corner of the building. A scar left by another portion of the same wall still exists on the northwest corner of the façade. Both ends, and the south façade of the house, are fitted with a two-course stepped water table; none is employed on the front wall, which at one time faced onto the jailyard. At the east end of the house is an exterior end chimney, while the west end has an interior one. Today the window openings, which do not have shutters, are equipped with modern nine-over-nine sash, but they retain certain trappings of the building's conversion in 1824, including the iron lattice covering; also dating to the same time are the structure's heavy batten doors. Two windows, one at the east end and one on the south façade, were bricked up in the twentieth century. The same century saw the addition of a box cornice and slate roof to the house. Only one outbuilding, a small wooden shed, was documented on the property by HABS.
The interior plan of the house is typical of a small hall-and-parlor dwelling of its era, containing two rooms on the main level and a further two in the attic. The east room is the larger of the two on the main floor; in its southeast corner is an enclosed staircase which rises to the garrett. The fireplace is treated with plain boards, which have been lapped in a way that is meant to recall a crossetted surround; similar treatment of the chimneybreast can be found in the west room, which is otherwise unembellished. A framed partition separates the two rooms, and is covered on both sides with horizontal beaded sheathing. The whole interior is fitted with diagonal board doors. The HABS investigation found that some refitting and redesigning of the interior rooms had taken place, but that finding out what changes were involved would have required significant removal of interior fittings; in addition, there was much evidence of repair, but little of outright alteration.
Significance.
The Accomac debtors' prison is significant for a number of reasons; chief among them is that it is the oldest municipal building still standing in Accomack County. In addition, it is a rare survivor of its type, and well illustrates the typical eighteenth-century penal building once common in Virginia.

Debtors' Prison (Worsham, Virginia)

The Debtors' Prison is a historic debtors' prison building located in Worsham, Virginia. Constructed in 1787, it is one of three such prisons, listed on the National Register of Historic Places remaining in Virginia; the other two are in Accomac and Tappahannock. Of the three, only the one in Worsham was constructed of wood. It is the oldest surviving public building in Prince Edward County, and dates to the time when Worsham was the county seat.
History.
Worsham served as the county seat of Prince Edward County between 1754 and 1872; the debtors' prison was built there in 1787 to provide delinquents with separate quarters from other prisoners. Construction of the "gaol for debtors" was actually authorized in 1786; two local men, Thomas Scott and Charles Allen, were directed to allow bids. One Richard Bibb appears to have been hired to build the prison, as he was paid fifty-two pounds for its construction once the completed structure was viewed and received.
Virginia abolished the imprisonment of debtors as a method of punishment in 1849; accordingly, at some point, possibly as early as 1820, the prison building was converted into a residence. Numerous alterations to the structure were carried out as part of the conversion, although many would be removed during 20th century renovations.
Little is recorded about the history of the jail once it became a house, although it is known to have been owned for a time by a family called Burke. They deeded it to one E. L. Dupuy in 1908, and it remained with his family until being purchased by Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) in 1950. They carried out renovations on the building in 1951.
After the Prince Edward Branch of Preservation Virginia dissolved in the 1970s, the building became property of Prince Edward County.
Design.
The Worsham Debtors' Prison is a small log structure measuring 14' by 18'; it has been described as having "the solid appearance of a building constructed with security in mind". It consists of a single room, with an unused attic area above. The logs used to build the walls are square-hewn and closely fitted, without chinking. These are held together with half-dovetailed joins at the corners. Similar, heavy logs, set closely together, were used in the construction of the floor and ceiling. Those in the ceiling extend about a foot past the front and back walls, thus forming a slight roof overhang. The roof is lighter, of frame construction. The foundation of the building is low and made of sandstone rubble; a chimney, made of brick, is located on the interior end.
Entrance into the prison building is through a pair of doors located in the center of the front wall. The outer of the two might possibly be a replacement; the inner one, with vertical beaded boards and horizontal braces, appears to be a product of the eighteenth century. The door is flanked by two small square windows, both unglazed; the southern one is only a conjectural restoration, based on the surviving northern window. The remains of three vertical iron bars were found in this opening, and they have served as a pattern for some of the restoration work. There is a small opening in the back wall of the jail that appears to have been used as a latrine slot.
Several additions to the jail were constructed upon its conversion to a private residence. Among these was a lean-to appended to the back wall. In addition a larger window was cut for the front wall, and another opening was cut into the ceiling to provide entry into the attic. Most of these additions were removed during Preservation Virginia's restoration of the building in 1951. The roof, initially of tin, was replaced by wooden shingles. All of the beaded siding was removed save for that under the gables. The age of this siding is not known, although it is believed to have dated to before the American Civil War, and might have been of eighteenth-century vintage. Further restorations were scheduled to have been carried out by Preservation Virginia later in the 1970s.
A more substantial prison building, made of stone, was erected just north of the old debtors' prison sometime around 1855. This structure had fallen in by the mid-1950s, when the walls were dismantled. A heavy iron door and a window grate from the newer building were saved at its demolition, and have since been erected just outside the old jail.
Significance.
The Worsham Debtors' Prison is a rare relic of 18th century Virginia, being one of the few log public buildings erected at that time to have survived to the present day; it is also the oldest remaining public building in Prince Edward County. The quality of the building's construction is also of note. The building is located across the road from the Old Prince Edward County Clerk's Office, another building remaining from when Worsham was the county seat.

Debtors' Prison (Tappahannock, Virginia)

The Debtors' Prison in Tappahannock, Virginia, is a historic debtors' prison dating back to the 18th century. Constructed sometime before 1769, it is one of three such structures remaining in Virginia, along with those in Accomac and Worsham The prison building is part of the Tappahannock Historic District, and as such was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
History.
The exact date of construction for the old debtors' prison is not known, but a court order from 1769 shows it as being surrounded by "prison bounds", indicating that the structure had most likely already been built and was in use by that date. Its existence is noted in another court order, dating to 1809, that separated criminal and debtor prison populations into different facilities. A town plat drawn up in 1850 shows it at its present location, on the courthouse green, along with four other jails. Little else is known about its history, save that it was most likely converted to other uses when the state of Virginia abandoned the use of imprisonment as a punishment for debt in 1849. Unlike similar buildings elsewhere in Virginia, the jail is still owned by the county government, which currently uses it as the county treasurer's office.
Design.
The prison building is simple in design, being made of Flemish bond brick and having three bays in front. The entry door is at the center of the front face of the structure, and has a well-worn sandstone sill at its foot. There is a more modern addition on the rear of the building. The prison's floor plan is almost square, and it is one-and-one-half stories tall.
Significance.
The Debtors' Prison is part of a compact block of historic structures, located in central Tappahannock and bounded by Church Lane, Queen's Street, Cross Street, and Prince Street, which together trace the town's political and maritime history. With the Old Clerk's Office, the Old Essex County Courthouse, and the New Essex County Courthouse, it forms the town's "most convincing case for architectural history". The four also serve to show the marked similarity of design often seen in county court facilities in the area.

Edward Joseph Hansom

Edward Joseph Hansom (22 October 1842 – 27 May 1900) was an English Victorian architect who specialised in ecclesiastical buildings in Gothic Revival style, including many Roman Catholic churches. 
He was the son of Charles Francis Hansom and the nephew of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803–1882), of an architectural dynasty from York. He was articled to his father in Bath in 1859 and was taken into partnership in 1867, when the practice was based in Bristol. He moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1871 to enter into partnership with Archibald Matthias Dunn (1832–1917), practising under the name of Dunn and Hansom.
Hansom was admitted ARIBA in 1868 and FRIBA in 1881. He served as President of the Northern Architects' Association in 1889-90 and was the first to represent the region on the RIBA Council. 
After a long period of ill-health, Hansom suffered from depression such that he was unable to work and shot himself in the office and died on 27 May 1900. 
Notable work includes the transepts, representing the first phase of building, to Downside Abbey, Somerset (1882); St Bede's College, Alexandra Park, Manchester; Our Lady Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church, North Berwick (1879); St Mary's RC Cathedral, military memorial, Edinburgh (1889); and the baptistery to St John's Church, Bath (1871).

Silsesquioxane

A silsesquioxane is an organosilicon compound with the empirical chemical formula RSiO3/2 where Si is the element silicon, O is oxygen and R is either hydrogen or an alkyl, alkene, aryl, arylene group. These materials have been proposed as supports for catalysts, and on pH-responsive material. Silsesquioxanes can have a cage like structure, see Figure 1, which is most commonly cubes, hexagonal prisms, octagonal prisms,
Their three dimensionality, high symmetry, and nanometer size makes silsesquioxanes promising building blocks for nanocomposites. The diversity of possible functional groups along with their controlled orientation in 3-D space allows for highly tailored nanometer-by-nanometer construction in all three dimensions with these unique nanobuilding blocks. The silica core confers rigidity and thermal stability that provides mechanical and thermal properties surpassing typical organic compounds. Combining the robust core with the functionalities of the attached organic groups can also change the physical properties of the SQs allowing for easier processing than typical ceramics. The mixture of organic and inorganic functionalities can lead to the creation of novel nanocomposite materials that exhibit properties intermediate and superior to those of traditional polymer and ceramic properties. Tailored SQs provide a solution where processing conditions prevent ceramic-like materials from being plausible or mechanical requirements prevent polymer-like materials from being useful. 
Structure.
Silsesquioxanes has been found to be RSiO3/2 with the identity of R typically being alkyl or organo-functional groups, the combined structure of these RSiO3/2 units vary depending on synthesis methods, starting materials and the catalyst used. The four most common silsesquioxane structures are cage structures in which the units form a cage of n units in a designated Tn cage, partial cage structures, seen in Figure 2, in which the aforementioned cages are formed but lack complete connection of all units in the cage, ladder structures in which two long chains composed of RSiO3/2 units are connected at regular intervals by Si-O-Si bonds, and finally random structures which include RSiO3/2 unit connections without any organized structure formation.
The structure of silsesquioxanes depends on the preparation method. To simplify, a silicon with a hydrolytically stable organic substituent and three easily hydrolyzed groups such as chlorine or alkoxy groups, which are reacted with water and an acid or base catalyst. The final structure depends on the function of the concentration of initial monomer, concentration of water, temperature, type of catalyst, and the nature of the non-hydrolyzing substituent. This can be seen in the following equations. Solvent hydrogen bonding can have a large effect on rates and types of molecular condensations. 
The basic silsesquioxane synthesis methods typically involved producing trichlorosilane precursors. The subsequent reaction used to form the silsesquioxanes were typically metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions with chloro- or alkylsilanes or organometallic coupling reactions with chlorosilanes. The choice of metal catalyst is dependent on the selected R substituents to be attached (for instance, with the addition of alkyl groups larger than methyl or organo-functional groups, platinum is used as a catalyst). Work has also been report for limited alterations of substituent addition, but in general there is to date no known method to direct or control the formation of particular substitutional isomers when introducing two or more different substituents in a silsesquioxane cage synthesis. 
When characterizing silsesquioxanes the typical methods involved are x-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (proton, carbon and silicon), and infrared radiation spectroscopy, though SEM and TEM have been used for visualization in crystal growth studies. Features of general importance when describing silsesquioxane compounds are the number of RSiO3/2 units in the cage compounds and the degree to which the silsesquioxane is condensed. In a fully condensed silsesquioxane compound, the general formula is RaSiaO(1.5a–0.5b)(OH)b with b=0, indicating that all oxygen atoms in the compound are bridging silicon atoms. A less condensed silsesquioxane compound (b>0) is indicative of the compound having less coordinated Si-O-Si connections, thus in general how condensed the compound is gives the nature of the macroscopic molecule (i.e. polymeric forms are typically highly condensed- almost fully connected networks). It is worth noting that when the cage formations of silsesquioxanes are produced, though many different sizes are possible (i.e. T8, T10, T12), the most preferred formation are the cubic T8 compounds due to the high stability of the Si4O4 rings in the cage.
Many polymeric forms of silsesquioxanes have been developed with varying molecular weights and synthesis methods. The first high molecular weight tractable polymeric silsesquioxane was a ladder type repeating unit, seen in Figure 3, polyphenylsilsequioxane, reported by Brown et al. in 1960. Brown’s findings were used as a basis for further research and synthesis variations by plethora of additional research groups investigating polyphenylsilsequioxanes. Though many alterations were made, the origin synthesis proposed by Brown involved a three step process outlined as follows: (1) the hydrolysis of phenyltrichlorosilane in a solvent with excess water to give a hydrolyzate, (2) equilibration of the hydrolyzate with potassium hydroxide at a low concentration and temperature to give the prepolymer, and (3) equilibration of the prepolymer at a high concentration and temperature to give the final polymeric form. It was found that the critical factors to increase the polymer weight were high concentration and temperature during the equilibration of the prepolymer. Another noteworthy milestone in the silsesquioxane polymeric materials is the development of soluble and stable polymethylsilsesquioxane with high molecular weights by Japan Synthetic Rubber. This polymer which, unlike its phenyl derivative, gels easily during the course of its synthesis, has found a wide range of alternative applications including cosmetics, resins, and chemical amplification resist for electron beam lithography.
Hydridosilsesquioxanes.
Hydridosilsesquioxanes are a silsesquioxane type with only hydrogen substituents on the silicon, and are thus purely inorganic compounds. Initial synthesis methods involved the adding benzene solutions of trichlorosilane to a mixture of benzene, concentrated sulfuric acid, and fuming sulfuric acid to yield the T10-T16 oligomers. The T8 oligomer was also synthesized, but by the reaction of trimethylsilane with a mixture of acetic acid, cyclohexane, and hydrochloric acid. It has been found that these compounds can be converted to silica coatings for application in environmental protection, and for application as an interlayer dielectric for integrated circuits.
Potential applications.
Electronics.
The synthesis of silsesquioxane materials for electronics applications can be quite detailed, with many variations occurring through the desired shapes of these structures as well as the different organic groups attached to these structures. 
The bridged polysilsesquioxanes were developed originally to produce controlled porosity in structures. Bridging refers to structures where two or more –SiO(3/2) units are attached by the same organic fragment to form molecular composites. These are most readily prepared from molecular building blocks that contain two or more trifunctional silyl groups attached to non-hydrolysable silicon-carbon bonds, with typical sol-gel processing. Monomers are usually dissolved in miscible solvent of water, with hydrolysis and condensation reactions catalyzed by acid, base or fluoride. The catalyst changes the physical properties of the silsesquioxane structures. Acid catalysts give clear, brittle solids, and base catalysts give opaque solids. It was found that mesopore size is proportional with the length of the bridge.
Synthesis of organosilsesquioxane films for semiconducting devices has been reported.0 °C. Commercially available silsesquioxanes can then be modified to alkylated silsesquioxanes by the cross-metathesis of alkenes with readily available vinyl-substituted silsesquioxanes. In order to form a low k dielectric film, copolymers of alkylsilanes are copolymerized with trichlorosilane, with properties being controlled by the ratios of each. These polymers are then separated by molecular weight, since only low molecular weight polymers can be applied by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) to a device. This is usually obtained by heating above the vapor pressure in a vacuum. There are also many other methods of applying these thin films for semiconductor devices such as spin coating, dip-coating, and spraying. The resulting material would have a molecular formula of [R-SiO1.5]x[H-SiO1.5]y with x+y being an integer between 5 and 30. The methods described for forming thin films are useful in filling in empty space in electric materials as well as giving them an even surface. 
Interest has also been shown in applying caged silsesquioxanes to these materials. Poly(methylsilsesquioxane), as mentioned above is an example of such a species. These materials give cage structures of varying sizes that are controlled by the synthetic processing. In general hydrolyzing hydrido- or organo- trichlorosilanes forms cages. Temperatures are below room temperature, and the system is kept dilute to favor intramolecular condensations. Condensation rates have also been found to slow by hydrogen bonding solvents. In general, caged structures are formed by kinetic not thermodynamic control.
Extensive research on silsesquioxanes as semiconductors, insulators and organic light emitting diodes (OLED) has been done by many companies and Universities, including Dow Corning, IBM, Honeywell, Japan Rubber Co, Hitachi, Mayaterials, Hybrid Plastics, University of Michigan and University of California-Irvine. These materials can be used in semiconductor devices as both semiconducting materials, with tuned functionality resulting from the attached organic groups, or as insulators in their native forms to form spacing in layers in semiconducting devices. These materials tend to have low dielectric constants (k), which makes them good thin film insulators. As organic OLEDs, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes make up an inorganic core with peripheral organic emitters making up the peripheral of a complex. This incorporation allows for an improved stability and an enhancement in electroluminescence properties. 
The first example of a type of silsesquioxane that has found application for interlayer dielectric applications is poly(hydridosilsesquioxane), which represents a linked-cage structure, which is sold under the name Fox Flowable Oxide. These hydrogen silsesquioxanes are readily used for ceramic coatings in devices such as semiconductors and can be found not only in the linked-cage (see Figure 5), but also in the ladder form as well (see Figure 4). These compounds are often applied to an electronic device with organic solvent through evaporative techniques for thin-film coating. These devices can be difficult to prepare due to the fact that silsesquioxanes can be unstable in solvents and it is difficult to control film thickness.
Methylsilsesquioxane materials are useful as spin-on-glass (SOG) dielectrics. Bridged silsesquioxanes have been used for quantum confined nano-size semiconductors. Silsesquioxane resins have also been used for these applications because they have high dielectric strengths, low dielectric constants, high volume resistivities, and low dissipation factors, making them very suitable for electronics applications. These resins have heat and fire resistant properties, which can be used to make fiber-reinforced composites for electrical laminates. 
With electronics getting smaller and smaller, the need for materials that keep these devices from short-circuiting is growing in demand. Single microchips contain thousands of interconnecting transistors that when overlapped, can cause interference problems, power dissipation and voltage issues. Silsesquioxane properties have the ability to prevent short-circuiting by acting as a rigid, insulating spacer; preventing corrosion or oxidation of metal conductors. They can level uneven topography, and fill gaps between closely spaced conductors. These films are easily applied through solvent evaporation with hydrogen silsesquioxane resins, and turned ceramic by heating the substrate in air. These films are known as interlevel dielectric (ILD) and protective overcoat films (PO). 
Industrial applications of OLEDs have a limited application. Traditional OLEDs do not typically contain inorganic materials, however due to the instability of OLEDs on their own, research is being conducted to look at hybrid materials that increase the stability of these compounds. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes have been looked at in order to form an inorganic core. These compounds give better mechanical properties and stability, with an organic matrix for good optical and electrical properties. The mechanisms of degradation in these devices is not well understood, but it is believed that material defect understanding is important for understanding the optical and electronic properties.
LEDs.
For potential applications to light emitting diodes, cubic silsesquioxanes. have been functionalized. One of the first precursors used in light emitting application was octadimethylsiloxysilsesquioxane, which can be prepared in yields of >90% by treating tetraethoxysilane or rice hull ash with tetramethylammonium hydroxide followed by dimethylchlorosilane. The general method of hydrolyzing organotrichlorosilanes is still effective here. When brominated or aminated, these structures can be coupled with epoxies, aldehydes, and bromoaromatics, which enable attachment of these silsesquioxanes to π-conjugated polymers. These methods can use copolymerization techniques, Grignard reagents, and different coupling strategies. There has also been research on the ability of conjugated dendrimer silsesquioxanes to behave as light emitting materials. Though, highly branched substituents tend to have π-π interactions, which hinder high luminescent quantum yield. 
It has been demonstrated that incorporation of silsesquioxane groups can improve materials properties such as solubility, amorphousness, thermal and oxidative stability. Such changes in turn leads to improved OLED device efficiencies and lifetimes. 
Catalysis.
Metallasilsesquioxanes may have applications in catalysts. Incompletely condensed silsesquioxanes like Cy7Si7O9(OH)3 are similar in structure to β-tridymite and β-cristobalite, making them good models for the silanol sites on silica surfaces. The structures of silsesquioxanes make them ideal for metal coordination as well, due to the fixed orientation of the silanol groups and also the siloxane bridges which can interact with the metal. Additionally the silsesquioxane can be modified for even better metal coordination via simply silylation reactions. Research has shown that silsesquioxanes can bind with numerous main group and transition group metals, including Na, Li, and Be.
The most frequently employed starting silsesquioxane for metal complex synthesis is the trisilanol derivative Cy7Si7O9(OH)3, originally reported from trichlorocyclohexylsilane, but can take several years to completion. This resulted in only a few incompletely condensed silsesquioxanes available in useful quantities for research. Consequently most research has been focused on the trisilanol derivative Cy7Si7O9(OH)3and its cyclopentyl-substituted analog. However recently Feher et al. have developed an acid-mediated cleavage of fully condensed silsesquioxane frameworks like Cy8Si8O12. The process results in silanediols that can further be used to create new metallasilsesquioxanes.
The general preparation for metal-silsesquioxane derivatives involves treating the parent silanol and the desired metal halide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. Another route of synthesis involves first deprotonating the trisilanol group using LiN(SiMe3)2. Aspinall et al. later succeeded in doing the same using three equivalents of n-BuLi in hexanes and further results indicate that alkali metal derivatives of deprotonated silsesquioxanes could also be prepared using alkali metalbis(trimethylsilyl) amides.
Much research is focused on the synthesis of metallasilsesquioxanes that containing metals that have not been done before and the potential application of the metallasilsesquioxanes as catalysts, as it has become accepted that metallasilsesquioxanes are good silica-supported transition metal catalysts. One example is a beryllium silsesquioxane, [Cy7Si7SO12BeLi]2.2THF. 
Metallasilsesquioxanes have not found commercial use as catalysts. The complexes are active as catalysts for alkene metathesis, polymerization, epoxidation and Diels-Alder reactions of enones. A number of metallasilsesquioxanes have been reported that can polymerize ethene, akin to the Phillips catalyst. The catalyst can be easily activated with trimethylaluminum and typically proceeds with high turnover number. Vanadium complexes as well as Ziegler-Natta type catalysts have also been employed as ethene polymerization catalysts. The coordination of metals to the silsesquioxane framework gives electrophilic centers that are approximately as electron-withdrawing as a CF3 group, leading to increased catalytic activity. Complexes of silsesquioxane and molybdenum and tungsten have been reported as alkene metathesis catalysts. The metallasilsesquioxanes complex with tungsten has even been recently used for ring-opening metathesis polymerization of norborene. The epoxidation of alkenes by the metallasilsesquioxanes is currently an area of high interest, with many groups focused on its development. Some of these materials catalyze alkene epoxidation by peroxide. They thus have potential in oxidation processes using environmentally friendly oxidizing agents like O2 and H2O2. The first reported catalytic alkene epoxidation was done by a titanium complex, epoxidizing compounds like cyclooctene and norbornene nearly quantitatively. Silsesquioxane-based complexes can promote Diels-Alder reactions, as well as other Lewis acid catalyzed reactions like Oppenauer oxidation and Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reductions. 
Antimicrobial silsesquioxanes.
Silsesquioxanes have been functionalized with biocidal groups to produce antimicrobial coatings. Organic ammonium salts are well known for their antimicrobial properties, meaning their ability to kill or inhibit the growth of harmful microbes. Specifically, quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) are used as disinfectants, antiseptics, and antifoulants that kill bacteria, fungi, and algae, but are not harmful to humans and animals. Several research groups have functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes with QASs. The relatively small size of the silsesquioxane molecule, 2-5 nm, allows a QAS functionalized molecule to have a charge density similar to dendrimers and thus the antimicrobial efficacy is prominent. Dimethyl-n-octylamine can be quaternized by octa(3-chloropropylsilsesquioxane), (T-ClPr)8, and transformed almost all eight chloropropyl groups into ionic quaternary ammonium chloride functions. The synthesis is based on a three-step hydrolytic polycondensation process of 3-chlo- ropropyltrimethoxysilane. The resulting material exhibited antimicrobial efficacy for the prevention of growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Array of QAS functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (Q-POSS) have been reported. These researchers varied the alkyl chain length from –C12H25 to –C18H37 and varied the counter ion between chloride, bromide, and iodine. The first reaction was the hydrosilylation between allydimethlamine and octasilane polyhedral oliomeric silsesquioxane via Karstedt’s catalyst to make a tertiaryamino-functinoalized silsesquioxane. The second step was the quaternization of the tertiaryamino groups with an alkyl halide. The alkyl halides used were 1-iodooctadecane, 1-bromohexadecane, and 1-chloroctadecane.
The silsesquioxane core in these hybrid materials provides an increased glass transition temperature, improved mechanical properties, higher use temperature, and lower flammability. These desirable properties combined with the ability to readily functionalize a silsesquioxane with multiple antimicrobial groups allows for robust biocides with higher charge densities while maintaining a compact molecular structure. The organic functionalities provide high compatibility with polymers allowing for easy incorporation into many mediums. Of particular interest are silicone paints and coatings used in hospitals. Typical biocidal ammonium functionalized polymers are incompatible, but silsesquioxanes closely mimic the silicone structure. A silicone based paint combined with QAS-functinalized silsesquioxanes could be used to paint medical and sanitary devices, biomedical devices, exam equipment, medical storage rooms, hospital rooms, clinics, doctor offices, etc. to prevent the formation and spread of bacteria. For example, the Q-POSS developed was combined with polydimethylsiloxane and catalysis to form a crosslinked network. The researchers found that coatings based on bromide and chloride had the best antimicrobial efficacy.

Olivier Voutier

Olivier Voutier (born May 30, 1796 in Thouars, France - died April 18, 1877 at Hyères, France) was a French naval officer who discovered the statue of the Venus de Milo in 1820, and fought in the Greek War of Independence.
Discovery of the Venus de Milo.
Voutier was the son of a naval officer, and at the age of fifteen entered the Naval School in Brest. In April, 1820, at the age of twenty-three he was an ensign on the French naval schooner "Estafette" stopping at the island in Milo in the Aegean. He was interested in the history of ancient Greece, and decided to see if he could find any objects of interest. He took two sailors with shovels and picks, and began digging in the ruins of an ancient theater located on the side of the island's highest hill. Voutier and the sailors found marble fragments, a bust, a carved foot, and two statues missing their heads, hands and feet. 
What happened next was described by author Gregory Curtis in "Disarmed, the Story of the Venus de Milo": 
"As Voutier and the two sailors were digging, another man, a local farmer as it turned out, was also working just twenty paces away trying to remove the stones from an ancient wall to use in a structure he was building on his farm. Voutier, glancing over that way, noticed that the man had stopped digging for the moment and was staring at something in a niche he had uncovered in the wall. His posture was curious enough that Voutier went to look himself.
As Voutier drew near, he could see that the farmer was busy again, covering something with dirt. Peering into the darkness of the chamber where the farmer was working, Voutier saw a statue, or at least the upper half of one, lying on its side and still partly buried. Its odd shape made it useless as a building block, so the farmer had decided to cover it over. Voutier gave him a small bribe to dig up the statue instead. It didn't take long to push aside the accumulated dirt and stones and prop the object up. It was the nude upper body of a woman. The tip of her nose and the small bun of hair gathered at the back of her head were both broken off. There was an ugly hole in her right side that Voutier assumed was the result of some crude restoration from long ago. Stains, nicks, and scrapes, evidently from the time when it had first fallen over, covered the surface of the statue. But despite these imperfections, Voutier sensed from the first glance that he was seeing something extraordinary. This torso was more glorious than anything he could have hoped to find when he set out that morning with the two sailors and a few picks and shovels.
Voutier insisted that the farmer search for the lower half of the statue, but his insistence revealed his excitement. Now the farmer wanted more money to continue digging. Voutier paid. He joined the farmer inside the niche, an oval enclosure about five yards wide. The walls were cut stone and had once been painted in a pattern that was still faintly visible. Overhead was an arched roof.
After a little digging here and there amid the rubble on the floor, the farmer found the lower half of the statue and brought it up out of the dirt. But the two parts couldn't be reassembled because a large section missing from the right side made it impossible to balance the top half on the lower. Yet another bribe persuaded the farmer to continue digging, but this time, since the missing piece was considerably smaller than the other two, the search took more work and time. When the farmer wanted to quit, Voutier calmly prodded him until he finally discovered the missing middle section.
At last Voutier and the farmer, perhaps with help from the two sailors, were able to place the top half of the statue on the lower. When they slid the middle section between the two larger pieces, the statue balanced, and they were able to see it as it was intended: a woman, nude from the waist up, her legs covered in wet drapery that was falling from her hips. This was of course the statue that would become known to the world as the Venus de Milo." 
Contrary to some accounts, the statue did not have its arms when it was discovered, as shown in drawings that Voutier made of the statue at the time.
The farmer, whose name was Yorgos Ketrotas, was interested in selling the statue. Over the next ten days, Voutrier brought Louis Brest, the French vice-consul on Milos, to see what he had found, along with a number of sailors and naval officers. One was a naval officer named Jules Dumont d'Urville. D'Urville, a classicist, recognized the identity of the statue and the importance of the discovery. However, the Captain of the "Chevrette" would not take the statue onto the ship. D'Urville wrote to the French Ambassador in Constantinople, the Marquis de Riviere, then went in person and persuaded him to buy the statue for France, which he did. A ship was sent to take the statue back to Toulon, and in 1821, the statue was presented to King Louis XVIII of France, who in turn donated it to the Louvre.
Voutier in the Greek War of Independence.
In 1821, Voutier resigned from the Navy and joined the Greek insurgents in the Greek War of Independence, under the command of Demetrios Ypsilantis. He took part in the siege of Tripolizza, where he arrived in September 1821, in the company of a British supporter of Greek independence, Thomas Gordon. In March 1822 the Minister of War of the provisional government of Greece, Ioannis Kolettis, gave Voutier the assignment of laying siege to the center of Athens without damaging its monuments. He was later named a colonel in the Greek Army. 
He retired to the city of Hyères in 1847, where he purchased the land of a former convent in the hills and constructed a villa called the Castel Sainte-Claire. He is buried in the park of the villa.
