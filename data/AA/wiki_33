Cullen Hightower

Cullen Hightower (1923 – November 27, 2008) was a well known quotation and quip writer from the United States. He is often associated with the American conservative political movement.
Hightower served in the U.S. army during World War II before beginning a career in sales. He began to publish his writing upon retirement. A collection of his quotations was published as "Cullen Hightower's Wit Kit." One of Hightower's most notable quotations is "People seldom become famous for what they say until after they are famous for what they've done." Ironically, Hightower became famous for what he said rather than for what he did. A number of other quotes are in his obituary.

Cell Metabolism

Cell Metabolism, launched in January 2005, is one of the newer titles in the Cell Press family. The journal focuses on physiology, with an emphasis on understanding the molecular basis of how the body self-regulates in the face of change, and how disturbances in these balances can lead to disease. Advances in these fields take on a special importance given the increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and related maladies ("metabolic diseases") in the developed world. Created in response to what top scientists saw as a growing need for a specialized journal in this field, Cell Metabolism is run by in-house editorial and production teams with full responsibility for selecting and preparing content for publication.
According to the "Journal Citation Reports", the journal has a 2012 impact factor of 14.619, ranking it second out of 121 journals in the category "Endocrinology & Metabolism."

Douglas Kinnaird

The Honourable Douglas James William Kinnaird (26 February 1788 – died 12 March 1830) was an English banker, politician, friend of Lord Byron and amateur cricketer. He was a Managing Partner in the banking firm of Ransom & Co. He also briefly served as Member of Parliament for Bishop's Castle from 1819 to 1820.
Early life.
Kinnaird was the fifth son of George Kinnaird, 7th Lord Kinnaird and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of the banker Griffin Ransom; and younger brother of Charles Kinnaird, 8th Lord Kinnaird (1780–1826). He was educated first at Eton College, and then at Göttingen, where he acquired a knowledge of German and French. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1807. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. in 1811.
In 1813 Kinnaird travelled with his friend John Cam Hobhouse on the continent, and was present at the battle of Culm. In the autumn of 1814 he travelled home from Paris with William Jerdan After his return to England he took an active share in the business of Ransom & Morland's bank, and on the dissolution of the partnership with Sir Francis Bernard Morland in 1819, assumed the chief management of the new firm.
Relationship with Byron.
In 1815 Kinnaird became, with Byron, Samuel Whitbread, Peter Moore, and others, a member of the sub-committee for directing the affairs of Drury Lane Theatre. In 1817 he visited Byron at Venice. He was a close friend of Byron, who called him "my trusty and trustworthy trustee and banker, and crown and sheet anchor" He was consulted by Byron on his business negotiations with John Murray, and with Hobhouse insisted on the destruction of the Byron memoirs, after Byron's death.
It was at Kinnaird's request that Byron wrote the "Hebrew Melodies" and the "Monody on the Death of the Right Hon. R. B. Sheridan, spoken at Drury Lane Theatre". Jerdan related that Samuel Taylor Coleridge, when his tragedy "Remorse" was under consideration by the Drury Lane authorities, was invited to read it to Kinnaird; after two acts, Kinnaird remarked that he had "listened to enough of your nonsense", and invited attention to a two-act piece of his own.
In politics.
At the general election in the summer of 1818 Kinnaird was nominated a candidate for the city of Westminster in the reform interest, but finding the contest hopeless withdrew after the third day's polling, and canvassed actively on behalf of Francis Burdett. Kinnaird refused to be nominated again on the death of Sir Samuel Romilly, the senior member, in November 1818, and seconded his friend Hobhouse, who was defeated after a vigorous contest by George Lamb in March 1819. At a by-election in July 1819 Kinnaird was returned to the House of Commons for the borough of Bishops Castle, Shropshire, and in his maiden speech on 30 November 1819 supported Lord Althorp's motion for a select committee on the state of the country. Kinnaird also took part in the debate on Hobhouse's anonymous pamphlet on 10 December, and contended that "any conclusion might be drawn from it" rather than that it was meant as an excitement to rebellion.
At the general election in March 1820 Kinnaird was included in the double return for Bishops Castle, but in the following June was declared 'not duly elected' by the select committee appointed to try the petition. He made no further attempt to enter parliament, but frequently took part in the discussions at India House. He was a member of the "Rota", a radical dinner club, to which Bickersteth, Burdett, and Hobhouse also belonged, and was famous for his "mob dinners", with thirty or forty guests.
Death.
Kinnaird died unmarried in Pall Mall East, London, after a long illness, on 12 March 1830, aged 42.
Works.
His works were: 
Cricketer.
Kinnaird made 19 known appearances in major cricket matches from 1808 to 1822.
He was mainly associated with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he also played for Surrey and Middlesex.

Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station

The Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station is the statewide research component of the University of Arkansas System's Division of Agriculture. The Division also includes the Cooperative Extension Service. The AAES and CES work together to develop and test new agricultural technology and extend it to the public. Research faculty and staff are based on five university campuses, at five Research and Extension Centers; six research stations and seven specialized units.
The faculty includes some 200 scientists with doctoral degrees, many of whom also have appointments as teaching faculty on their respective campuses. AAES scientists conduct basic and applied research to assist producers, processors and consumers of food, fiber and bio-energy; other agribusinesses; families and communities. Major research areas focus on production and processing of important Arkansas plant and animal commodities; environmental issues; food safety and security; human, family and community development; and human nutrition and health.
AAES scientists often work with colleagues in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, other state experiment stations and other agencies in the U.S. and abroad, as well as with local producers and colleagues in industry organizations or companies.
The AAES Director reports to the U of A System's Vice President for Agriculture. AAES Department Heads report to the AAES Director. Departments are also departments for academic programs of the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences on the Fayetteville campus and the School of Forest Resources at UA-Monticello, and related programs of the Cooperative Extension Service.

History.
The University of Arkansas was established in 1871 under the provisions of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862, which provided for federal government support of "colleges for the common man" in each state. Land-Grant colleges were mandated to provide higher education, research and public service in agriculture, engineering and military science as well as the usual classical studies. Agricultural research commenced right away, but students showed little interest in agricultural courses. The Arkansas legislature in 1888 established the Agricultural Experiment Station with matching federal funding from the Hatch Act of 1887. The first AES Director, Albert Menke, used increased funding for faculty and staff to expand the research program and course offerings by the same faculty members. Student interest increased, and the College of Agriculture was finally established in 1905. The same faculty for many years conducted all three land-grant college missions of teaching, research and educational services for farmers and rural families. In 1914, the Smith-Lever Act created a national Agricultural Extension Service, and in 1915 the Arkansas Legislature appropriated matching funds to secure the Smith-Lever federal funds to create the Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service. Until 1959, the AAES and CES were units of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics at UA, Fayetteville. That changed in 1959 when the U of A Board of Trustees created the Division of Agriculture as a separate statewide unit of the University of Arkansas System. The Division now administers the AAES and CES; although many research and extension faculty members also have teaching appointments on the campuses where they are housed.

Jehoida Hodges

Joseph Jehoida Hodges (15 July 1876-13 September 1930) was a Welsh international rugby union player. He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks. He played club rugby for London Welsh and Newport RFC.
Hodges, along with fellow Welsh internationals George Boots, and later George Travers is recognised with adopting forward formation play in scrums and line outs. Although forwards were responsible for these areas of play there was little defined tactics or specialisation before the early twentieth century. Hodges helped bring tactical formations and therefore a level of specialisation to forward play. He was described as a hard working and an excellent all-round player who could fill in at most positions, even on the wing.
International career.
Wales.
Hodges made his debut for Wales against England in 1899, after only his second season playing for Newport. Hodges played in three Triple Crown winning campaigns, provided forward resistance against the famous 1905 All Black 'loose head' and was part of Wales' first away win to Scotland. The later included a full on fist fight between the packs.
One of Hodges most impressive moments in a Welsh shirt was in the 1903 match against England. Welsh winger Tom Pearson had taken a heavy blow to the ribs by England's notoriously heavy tackler Gamlin, and was forced to retire. Hodges showed his famous adaptability when moved to the wing to cover Pearson's position and scored three tries in a 21-5 victory for the Welsh.
International games played.

Later career and death.
After leaving club rugby Hodges became a publican, first at the Salvation Hotel in Newport and then at the Park Hotel, Waunlwyd. Hodges died on September 13, 1930, his body was returned to his birth town of Risca where he was buried on September 17 at Cromwell Road cemetery. His coffin was borne by former Welsh internationals.

On February 27, 2004, "The Baylor Lariat" published an editorial in support of San Francisco's offering of marriage licenses to gay couples. The piece, which was supported by five of the editorial board's seven members, elicited a response from Robert B. Sloan Jr., who served as Baylor University president at the time. In a written statement, he claimed that he and many of the students, alumni, and parents were "justifiably outraged".

Basque Chilean

Many Basques arrived in Chile in the 16th,17th,18th,19th and early 20th century from their homeland in northern Spain (see Basque Provinces) and parts of southwestern France, as conquistadors, soldiers, sailors, merchants, priests and labourers. Due to their traditional hard work and entrepreneurship, many of them rose to the top of the social scale and intermarried into the Chilean elites formed by Basques, giving birth to the new Basque-Chilean aristocracy in Chile. This union is the basis of the Chilean elite of today. But also, they immensely contributed to the ethnic make up of the bulk of the Chilean population.
Many years after the first waves of settlers, thousands of Basque refugees fleeing Spanish Civil War in 1939 also settled and have many descendants in the country and have even intermarried with Spanish ethnic groups other than Castilians, and other European ethnic groups. An estimated 1.6 million (10%) and 3.2 million (20%) Chileans have a surname (one or both) of Basque origin.
To describe the Basque-Chilean relationship, we cite Miguel de Unamuno, who said: "There are at least two things that clearly can be attributed to the Basques: the Society of Jesus and the Republic of Chile."
History.
The Basque presence in Chile began in the conquista period, 
for in the armies of the first colonizers came a contingent important soldiers from the Basque Provinces and from Navarra. In the 16th century, of the 157 Peninsular families that settled in Chile, 39 had Basque surnames. This number progressively grew, as reflected in the number of governors of Basque origin.
Forms a regional immigration corridor between Spain and Chile, one that is large, visible, and continues over time. Basque immigration can be divided into historical periods: discovery, foundation, and colonial period; the wave of immigration of the 18th century; and the recent immigrants (19th and 20th centuries). 
During the 18th century, the country experimented a mass immigration coming from the Basque provinces and Navarra, by the end of the 18th century represents 27% of the Chilean population. This raised the Basques to being the most important regional group in the population, displacing the natives and descendants of those born in New Castile, Old Castile, and Andalucía. These immigrant families initially dedicated themselves to their preferred form of business, and in successive years produced many alliances with families of Castilian origin possessing lands and titles, giving birth to a new social group known in Chilean history as the ""Castilian-Basque Aristocracy.""
In the second half of the 19th century came a new wave of Basque immigration, this time as much from the Spanish regions as the French. This migratory flood are extended until the end of the Spanish Civil War.

Van Camp accounting

Van Camp accounting is one of the two methods California community property law uses to deal with community funds and/or labor is used to enhance the value of separate property.
To calculate, courts will value the manager's services at a market rate and subtract community expenses from that amount. The result is considered community property. The effect of this is that the net income earned by the owner of the separate property results in the manner in which income is treated under California law, which is community property. This method is preferred when the character of the business is the reason for its income. In the case where the management is the main cause for growth and production, Pereira accounting should be used.

Plumularioidea

Plumularioidea are one of the few rather robustly established superfamilies of the cnidarian suborder Conica. 
This superfamily unites about 30 genera in the following families:
These thecate hydroids grow in erect colonies, branched in some species but unbranched in others. Each branch may bear a single or several animals. In the latter case the hydrothecae are arranged in a neat single file; in either case they are not set on stalks but grow from the branches directly. The hydrothecase have a cusped or even rim and instead of a diaphragm a well-defined floor with a hydropore that is usually off-center. The hydranths have a conical hypostome - as is typical for the suborder Conica - and a single whorl of thread-like tentacles. The gastrodermis contains areas with and others without digestive function. Nematophores are always present and usually protected by nematothecae. The gonotheca are borne singly or in groups, they may or may not have protective hydrocladia or appendages. The gonophores are usually fixed sporosacs, more rarely they are rather reduced medusoids.

The Folkways Years, 1959–1961

The Folkways Years, 1959 - 1961 is a compilation album of songs by Dave Van Ronk released in 1991.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote of Van Ronk's musical background and that he continued to "... play and sing hard, as if still trying to be heard over Dixieland arrangements. That sounded unusual to the more polite folk audiences of the time, in contrast to singers who played tame versions of traditional folk and blues tunes. But more than three decades later, it keeps Van Ronk's performances from sounding as dated as those of many of his peers do. Nobody worries much anymore about an articulate, urban white man trying to sound like an unlettered, rural black man, and these recordings have proven very influential... If he was imitating the originators at the time, now he sounds like a master whose work has been emulated by the rock musicians who followed him (and who made a lot more money doing so than he ever did)."

Josh Hyde

Josh Hyde (Born March 13, 1979) is an American writer, director and independent filmmaker. His films, including the award winning short Chicle, have traveled the world over, achieving critical acclaim at such respected film festivals as Berlin International and Tribeca International. Hyde is known for his personal, character driven narratives that often explore the themes of cultural identity and global politics; a likely result of his own bi-racial identity as an American-Filipino filmmaker. Hyde currently resides in the New York borough of Brooklyn.
Background and education.
Josh Hyde was born on March 13, 1979 to an American father and Filipino immigrant mother in St. Louis, Missouri. The second of three children, Hyde was raised in Carbondale, Illinois, naturally excelling in foreign language and the arts.
After graduating from Southern Illinois University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Cinema and Photography, Josh left the U.S. for Cusco, Peru, where he directed "Despacho", a documentary examining the cultural exchange between western medicine and indigenous Peruvian shamanistic techniques. Upon his return, Hyde moved to Chicago, IL where he interned with the prestigious Kartemquin Films and was introduced to his mentor, Steve James ("Hoop Dreams, Stevie, The New Americans, The Reel Paradise".) There he worked as a translator on "The New Americans", and began writing the screenplay for "Chicle Y Postales."
In 2003 Hyde entered the MFA program at Ohio University, working closely under acclaimed Croatian director/producer, Rajko Grlic("Border Post, Josephine, Caruga, Sretno Dijete").
In the summer of 2004 Hyde returned to Cusco to shoot the short film version of his feature length script, entitled "Chicle". To date the short film has played in festivals the world over, including: Tribeca Int’l, Hamptons Int’l, Berlin Int’l, Mill Valley, Vladviostock Int’l, Brisbane Int’l, Black Mariah, Chicago Int’l, Zimbabwe Int’l, and Athens Int’l. Its honesty and innocence resonates strongly with both American and International audiences, consequently landing itself in the Korean National Film Archive, where it is viewed as an example of excellence in film textbooks and curriculum.
After receiving his MFA, Josh moved to New York City where he continues to make films on both a national and international scale.
Current projects.
Josh Hyde has currently completed his latest film, "Last Man Standing", a documentary that chronicles the life of up and coming alt-folk musician Drew Landry.
“Five years ago, Drew Landry had scarcely picked up a guitar, but the truth and authenticity of his songs are generations old. Born into the heart of Southwest Louisiana’s Cajun Country, Landry was raised amid the pressures of poverty, divorce, child abuse, illness, and a culture vanishing before his eyes. Through it all he has stubbornly persisted, using his hard-hitting past and deep-rooted culture as fuel for his poignant lyricism.
Through an intimate, cinema verite style, Last Man Standing chronicles three years of Landry’s life as he struggles to follow his “calling” in the wake of family pressures, failed business ventures and the unexpected tragedy of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Though he claims “he’s just telling his stories,” it’s clear that his songs offer a therapeutic voice to one of the most historically disenfranchised parts of the American landscape.
Regardless of his critical acclaim, modest record sales and performances alongside distinguished musicians such as Dwight Yoakum and Hank Williams III, it proves to be a long road to “success” for Landry, and despite his ambition, he is a man riddled with contradiction. At times, he is a dedicated family man, spending his days working in the Atchafalaya Basin and rebuilding his homeland after the storms, while at others he is self-centered and ruthlessly independent, seeming to forget the power of his words as he wrestles with his own ego.
His greatest battle comes as he departs on an impulsive tour of the West Coast, where he loses his band on the first gig and spends the remaining weeks coasting on fumes from show to show. As gas prices soar and record deals are made and broken, a diverse cast of musicians share their stories and experiences, painting a vibrant picture of the lonely horseman against the backdrop of the American West.
Back home, still wary of the music industry and unwilling to compromise his artistic vision, Landry once again decides to do it on his own. With a guitar on his knee, a handful of friends, and an abundance of faith, Drew proves that sometimes success is simply a matter of being the last man standing.”
In the Fall of 2008, Hyde plans to return once again to Cusco, for the much anticipated filming of his feature length script "Chicle Y Postales", and its subsequent release that Spring.

Clarke subsequently joined the county under-21 panel and enjoyed more success. In 1972 Galway reached the All-Ireland final in that grade. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion, however, victory went to Galway and Clarke collected a coveted All-Ireland medal.
By this stage Clarke had already made his debut with the Galway senior team. He first tasted major success in 1975 as Galway captured the National Hurling League title. It was a sign of things to come for the team. Later that summer Clarke’s side trounced Westmeath and shocked Cork to book their place in the All-Ireland final. Kilkenny, the reigning champions, provided the opposition on that occasion. Galway got off to a good start and took a 0–9 to 1–3 lead at half-time. Kilkenny, inspired by marvelous displays by Eddie Keher and Liam 'Chunky' O'Brien, powered on to win by 2–22 to 2–10. In spite of this defeat Clarke was later presented with his first All-Star award.
Galway faced a series of defeats at the penultimate stage of the championship for the next few seasons; however, Clarke captured a second All-Star award in 1978. The following year Galway shocked Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final for the second time of the decade. Once again the All-Ireland final saw Galway play Kilkenny. In one of the least exciting finals of the decade Galway continued their losing streak and capitulated to ‘the Cats’ by 2–12 to 1–8. In spite of the defeat Clarke claimed a third All-Star.
In 1980 Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. On that occasion Limerick provided the opposition, however, Clarke missed the game. Galway got off to a good start with two goals and led by 2–7 to 1–5 at the interval. Limerick fought back in the second-half; however, Galway secured the victory by 2–15 to 3–9. It was Galway’s first All-Ireland medal and Galway’s first since 1923. The celebrations at Croke Park on that occasion surpassed anything that had ever been seen before. Clarke capped off the year by collecting a fourth All-Star award.
In 1981 both Galway and Limerick met in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, it took a replay to find a winner. Galway emerged to take part in their third All-Ireland final in-a-row. Offaly, a team that Clarke’s side defeated on the way to the championship the previous year now provided the opposition. In another close encounter Galway looked set to make history as they took a six point lead after the interval. The team, however, failed to score for the last twenty-three minutes and Offaly took their first All-Ireland title.
The next three seasons saw Galway defeated at the All-Ireland semi-final stage. Clarke retired from inter-county hurling in 1984.
Provincial.
Clarke also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He captured his first Railway Cup title in 1980 as Connacht defeated Munster. Silke captured further Railway Cup medals in 1982 and 1983.

<doc id="18350779" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18350779" title="Battle of Los Ángeles">
Battle of Los Ángeles

The Battle of Los Ángeles was a military action fought on March 22, 1880 between the Chilean and Peruvian armies during the Tacna and Arica Campaign of the War of the Pacific. The Chilean forces under Commander in chief Manuel Baquedano assaulted and defeated the Allied stronghold guided by Andres Gamarra garrisoned at Los Angeles hill top.
Preliminary moves.
After a successful scout mission to acknowledging the Allied strength in the area, a massive landing took place at Ilo between February 18 and 25, unshipping 9,500 men on the Peruvian shores.
Expedition to Mollendo.
The Chilean command decided to launch a second operation against Mollendo, so on the 8 were shipped the 3rd Line Regiment, the Navales and Zapadores battalions, 10 engineers and 30 riders, all under Col. Orozimbo Barboza. The goal was to fix the Peruvian 1st Division keeping it from aiding the second one which were to be attacked by Baquedano’s main force and destroy the docking facilities of Mollendo to obviate the need in the future for blockading the port.
Along with Barboza, the engineer Federico Stuven was sent to repair the rail road broke by Zapata on February. Performing this task a fierce skirmish was held by soldiers of the “Buin” 1st Line Regiment and the Peruvian Gendarmes. Meanwhile, a Navales Regiment detachment was unshipped at Islay and took Mollendo on the 9 without any resistance. The Peruvians reacted quickly concentrating troops in order to counterattack. Barboza took Mejia on the 10, disabling the rail road and several freight wagons. When he returned to Mollendo saw that great part of his army was looting and burning the port committing abuses against the population. Barbosa re-embarked his troops and left Mollendo on the 13. This event caused considerable embarrassment to the administration in Santiago and to the army; according to private Letters of Liutenant Rafael Torreblanca, some soldiers were condemned to capital punishment.
Expedition to Moquegua.
In the meantime, on March 12, under the command of General Cavalry Commander Gen. Manuel Baquedano, the 2nd Division was ordered to march over Mollendo. This force was formed by the “Buin” 1st Line and Santiago regiments, the Atacama and Bulnes battalions, two artillery batteries and the Cazadores a Caballo and Granaderos a Caballo cavalry regiments.
At 03:00 hrs, Baquedano marched with 800 riders and a company of the 1st Line Regiment, only to rest the next day at the Ilo river valley, abundant in food and water. Here was to wait for the rest of the division, which started to move on the 15. The operations line extended alongside the rail road from Ilo to Moquegua The region was extremely arid, so in order to supply the men with water, a train was set with a water wagon. Baquedano reached Hospicio, were in a lack of calculation, the entire water supply were consumed. When the rest of the division reached Hospicio and found no water, a discipline issue arose but it was quickly resolved with another water cargo sent by train. Meanwhile, Baquedano continued his march to Conde, reaching Moquegua on the 20.
Meanwhile, acknowledging he was outnumbered, Col. Andres Gamarra with the 1st Division of Montero's Southern Army withdrew to the defensive position at Los Angeles hill. Following him, Baquedano marched over Los Angeles on March 20.
Chilean Army.
The Chilean task force led by Manuel Baquedano was formed by the 2nd Line and Santiago regiments, the Atacama and Bulnes battalions, two artillery batteries and 300 riders from the Granaderos and Cazadores cavalry regiments; in total about 4,500 men.
Chilean strategy.
Baquedano made several scout missions to the Peruvian positions, thinking a bold plan to take them. Colonel Muñoz with twelve companies of the 2nd Line and Santiago regiments, an artillery battery and 300 riders was commissioned to attack the Peruvian left flank sited at El Pulpito. On the night of the 21, Juan Martinez' Atacama Battalion would outflank the Peruvian positions marching along the Torata river’s creek and later to climb the Guaneros slope covered by the darkness. Baquedano with three companies of the Santiago and the Bulnes Battalion and two batteries were to frontally charge the Peruvians.
Peruvian Army.
Col. Gamarra had the Grau, Cazadores de Cuzco, Canas and Canchis infantry battalions, under the command of Col. Julio Chocano, Col. Manuel Gamarra, Col. Martin Alvarez and Col. Manuel Velasco, plus a column of Gendarmes of Moquegua led by Col. Manuel Jimenez, gathering up around 1,400 soldiers.
Peruvian strategy.
Gamarra’s plan was to use the terrain to his advantage, and to wait the Chilean assault on Los Angeles hill summit, considered by that time as unbeatable, due to its location over a hill that could only be assaulted on the front of the same name slope, and has to be taken with an assail in ascension and under fire, enhancing the attacking difficulties. The only weak spot was the Tumilaca river creek, but it was very easy to defend from El Pulpito. On the Pampa del Arrastrado, on the upper Los Angeles plateau, must be attacked by climbing huge and very even rocks forming a vertical stone wall.
The Grau Battalion were stationed on Los Angeles summit in front of Tarmolambo, covering the road to Alto de la Villa, and the Granaderos de Cuzco Battalion was set on the Quilin Quilin heights with two companies forwarded to El Pulpito. The right flank was not defended with any unit since it was believed it was impossible to climb. On the rear, on the Pampa del Arrastrado were placed the Canchis and Canas battalions, as a reserve. These two were to relieve the other two units every 24 hours.
The battle.
On the night of the 21, 20 soldiers of the Grau Battalion led by Col. Chocano attacked the positions of the Cazadores a Caballo Regiment, killing three soldiers and capturing four horses. On their retreat, Chocano's men were engaged by the Atacama Battalion rearguard. Despite being discovered, Baquedano ordered Martinez to proceed as planned. In the meantime, Muñoz’ column marched in a narrow path formed by the Tumilaca river's creek, with a company of the 2nd Line and a Santiago battalion on the vanguard. Baquedano’s force forwarded whilst the Chilean wings were deploying, assuming positions in the front line.
By 04:00 hrs of March 22, the battle started when Muñoz’ troops were sighted by the soldiers at El Pulpito, being engaged by a company of the Granaderos de Cuzco Battalion immediately, reinforced later by another one of the Canchis Battalion. These two companies successfully detained Muñoz advance since his men were trapped in the narrow corridor and shot from the heights. Also, the troops at Tambolambo were contained by the Peruvian fire.
Gamarra sent the Granaderos de Cuzco and Canas battalions to reinforce the position on his left flank, but the Atacama Battalion reached the summit, assailing the astonished Peruvian soldiers and routing their lines with a bayonet charge.
Ending.
With the terrain advantage lost, the rest of Gamarra's soldiers began to refold. On Quilin Quilin, the 2nd Line Regiment successfully extracted one company out of the gorge, and set one cannon on the heights in front of the Peruvians. With this support, the Chileans made out of the entrapment and threw the defenders out of their positions. The rest of the Allied forces realized the magnitude of the defeat and joined the bulk of the army marching to Torata. On the site, the notice of the Chilean persecution reached them, and a company of the Granaderos de Cuzco was left to cover the retreat, until the rest of the army reached Chuculay, meanwhile Laiseca’s men retreated to Carumas.
Aftermath.
The Chilean Army lost 50 men, while the Peruvian lost around 145 men. The victory raise Chilean morale, since the position was considered unbeatable. For this action, the Atacama Battalion won a commendation and Baquedano was promoted to Commander in Chief of the Chilean Operations Army, replacing Erasmo Escala after the latter resigned.

Brett-Livingstone Strong

Brett-Livingstone Strong (born October 31, 1953) is an Australian-born artist, best known for his sculptures of Hollywood celebrities.
Career.
In 1972, Strong was commissioned to paint the royal invitation for the opening of the Sydney Opera House by Queen Elizabeth II.
In 1977, Strong carved John Wayne's face in a 12½-ton boulder that had fallen onto the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. In 1979, he sold it to an Arizona company and it currently resides in the library of the Lubbock Christian University in Lubbock, Texas.
Strong created a life-size bronze statue of John Lennon, entitled "Imagine". He began work on the sculpture as a tribute to Lennon after the musician's death in 1980. Originally unveiled in New York City by Andy Warhol, it currently is in the possession of a private collector.
Strong painted a portrait of Michael Jackson entitled "The Book" which reportedly sold for $2.1 million to Hiromichi Saeki Corp. in 1990, making it the most money ever paid to a living artist for the sale of a portrait. This portrait is claimed to be the only portrait that Michael Jackson sat for an artist's rendering and made its first appearance since 1992 in July 2009. It was displayed for public viewing in Harlem near the Apollo Theater. Strong was a good friend of Michael Jackson and Strong's studio houses a large collection of Jackson's artwork.
In the 1980s, Strong completed work on the National Monument to the U.S. Constitution, commissioned by former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. The monument was to have been dedicated by president George W. Bush and placed on the grounds of the White House. Currently the monument is part of a nationwide educational program entitled The Spirit of Freedom about the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.
In the mid 1980s, Strong's painting "Homage a Henri Rousseau" became the cover artwork for the Fleetwood Mac album "Tango in the Night". The original painting had been bought by singer/guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and was hanging in Strong's home at the time.
Strong created NASA's "National Space Exploration Monument" for display in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. In July 1994, Vice President Al Gore announced this monument honoring the men and women of the United States Space Program and celebrating the anniversary of man's landing on the moon.
In the late 1990s Strong proposed a "City of Angels Monument" project designed to create a symbol for Los Angeles along the lines of New York's Statue of Liberty or Paris' Eiffel Tower. The $3.6 billion development was to cover nearly in downtown Los Angeles with the central focus being a tower as the base for a female angel, wings spread, holding a sword of light above her head. The project did not go forward and Strong filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005.
After Debbie Rowe, an ex-wife of Michael Jackson, had nominated Strong for knighthood, the Duke of Gardham made Strong a knight in October 2009, in recognition of Strong's charitable work for children.

Humboldt County (film)

Humboldt County is a 2008 comedy/drama film by Darren Grodsky and Danny Jacobs. It stars Jeremy Strong, Fairuza Balk, Frances Conroy, Madison Davenport, Brad Dourif, Chris Messina and Peter Bogdanovich. The film made its debut at SXSW on March 7, 2008. It was picked up by Magnolia Pictures and was released on September 26, 2008.
Plot.
Peter Hadley (Jeremy Strong) is an overachieving medical student at UCLA. Peter earns failing grades from his professor, who is also his father (Peter Bogdanovich) and unable to graduate he becomes bitter and disillusioned. He then meets up with the free spirited Bogart (Fairuza Balk). The two of them go back to her apartment after a night of drinking and have casual sex. Afterwards she gets up to go for a drive and asks Peter if he'd like to come, to which he agrees. The two of them drive northwards through the night and Peter eventually falls asleep. When he wakes up, he finds that Bogart has driven him all the way to Humboldt County. It is here that he meets her family. Jack (Brad Dourif) and Rosie (Frances Conroy) took her in when her family abandoned her, and they became her surrogate parents. He also meets Max (Chris Messina), Jack and Rosie's son and Charity (Madison Davenport), Max's daughter.
After an uncomfortable night in which Peter finds out that they are all involved in farming pot, he finally manages to go to sleep. He is woken up in the morning by Max. When he gets dressed, he finds out that Bogart has left. Stranded and unwilling to call his father for help, Peter's only choice is to take the bus, which won't come for another day. Max enlists him to help him with his marijuana crop, to which Peter reluctantly complies. After a day of working on some irrigation problems, they relax back at Jack and Rosie's. Bob and Steve (played by Directors Darren Grodsky and Danny Jacobs respectively), friends of Max arrive bloodied and dirty. Some local hicks found their garden, roughed them both up and stole their plants. The next day, Peter helps Max again with his plants. He becomes so focused on it that he misses the bus again. It is after this that he begins to bond with Max and the rest of his family. He quickly falls in love with the place and stops trying to leave, developing feelings similar to Stockholm Syndrome. He begins to understand empathy and love (the thing he lacked, which caused him to fail his final exam in the first place). When Jack asks him what he plans to do after this, Peter is stunned to realize that he'd never thought that there would be an "after this".
His sudden fear that he'd never leave is furthered by a conversation that he has with Bob and Steve in a bar. Steve explains that almost everyone who is in Humboldt County now came there from somewhere else and never left, including Jack and Rosie. He also reveals that he was in Peter's shoes a few years earlier; he was a student at Stanford and followed a girl here and never left. When Peter doubts that their scenarios were the same, Steve also mentions that the girl he followed was Bogart. When they get up to leave, Bob refuses because he sees the guys that stole their plants sitting at a table behind them. While he and Steve argue about whether or not he's actually going to say something, Peter drunkenly walks over and confronts them. He then throws his drink in one of their faces and they all run out of the bar with the hicks in pursuit. They get away and are walking through the woods, laughing about what Peter had just done when Steve says that he wants to show them something. He takes them up to an unfamiliar area of the woods where there is a massive plantation, at least fifty plants. Steve and Bob start to steal a couple because they figured that no one would notice. At this time, Peter notices a sleeping bag on the ground just seconds before someone fires a shotgun at them. As they run away, Peter stops and looks back and sees that the person chasing them is Max. It's revealed that this is his secret garden. Max is angry and feels betrayed that he caught Peter stealing his plants and he yells at him to leave.
When Peter gets back to Jack's, Jack confronts him and asks him how many plants Max has. At first, he is hesitant to answer, so Jack takes him out on a nature walk and explains to him the dangers of having more than a few plants. He believes that by growing only twenty plants, he makes enough to get by and keeps from attracting the fed's attention. He warns Peter against letting greed run his life, because doing so destroys the entire reason they came out to the lost coast in the first place. After this, he goes to Max's house and asks him why he didn't tell him about the other plants. It's at this time that a federal police cruiser comes by and arrests Peter and Max. Peter is interrogated, but he reveals nothing and they are let go. Afterwards Peter starts to question why he is still there. The next day, Jack has a BBQ. He confronts Max about his secret crop. Without answering his question, Max instead mocks Jack, saying that the feds are probably there for all of the research that Jack has been doing all of these years. Jack angrily storms off and Rosie reveals to Peter that Jack isn't Max's father. Jack, Rosie and her then-husband, Charlie were all friends when they worked as professors at UCLA and they decided to move to Humboldt County together. However, eventually Charlie, who had been a long time alcoholic and drinking buddy of Jack's, died in a car accident while suffering from an episode of extreme alcohol withdrawal.
Peter decides that he can't be a part of Max's operation any more and he tries to leave. Max gets angry and tells him that this isn't a game and he can't back out, but Peter starts walking away anyway. Max then starts to cry and tells Peter that if he doesn't pull this off, Charity will end up just like him. While this affects Peter greatly, he still continues to walk off. Charity then finds Peter crying by a tree and asks him what's wrong. He asks her what she wants to be when she grows up and she says an astronaut. When she asks him what he wants to be, he says that he no longer knows, and she says that that's all right, which comforts Peter.
The next day, Peter's father shows up at the house, using Star-69 and MapQuest he managed to find where Peter was. After a brief visit with Jack and Rosie, where he is greatly put off to find that this is where his son has been all this time, he tells Peter that they're leaving, and Peter reluctantly goes with him despite his new-found bond with Jack and Rosie. As they're driving, his father tells Peter that he decided to pass him, but this news doesn't affect Peter much. He then sees Bob and Steve speeding down the road in the opposite direction, followed by Max and then by a federal helicopter. Peter realizes that they must have found Max's secret crop and are on their way to raid it. He gets out of the car and tells his father to head for the beach (advice that Max had told him earlier) and he runs off to stop Max from trying to save his crop.
Peter's father gets to the beach, where he finds Jack along with all of the other local pot farmers. He informs him that Peter took off. Jack hadn't seen Max anywhere and he connected the dots and headed off towards Max's crop. When Peter gets there, he finds Max trying to save as many of his plants before the DEA gets there and Peter begins to help. Then the feds show up and Peter and Max narrowly manage to hide themselves. Then Jack shows up and leads them both back to the beach, where Charity happily reunites with Max. Peter says that he's sorry to Max for his loss and Max tells him not to take it so seriously. That night, Max is at the bar drowning his sorrows when his drunken behavior gets him kicked out. He is then seen driving down the highway and laughing to himself. The scene then cuts to the next day when a sheriff shows up at Jack and Rosie's and informs them that Max is dead.
They then call Peter, who is staying at a hotel with his father, and tell him. He attends the funeral and afterwards finds Jack in his study, weeping to himself. Jack is ridden with guilt, he says that it was his idea to come up there and he blames himself for the death of Charlie and now Max. He breaks down saying that he has nothing left, but Peter then tells him that has so much left and that he had not yet reached the event horizon (a concept of physics that Jack describes to Peter as the point of no return). The ending is left up to the viewer for interpretation. It shows Peter and his father having breakfast at a diner before leaving back for Los Angeles. A bus then pulls up outside as one of the passengers needs to use the bathroom. Peter then gets up – his father apparently assuming he is going to the bathroom – and heads outside and gets on the bus, which then leaves when the other passenger gets back.
Critical response.
As of October 11, 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 58% of critics rated the film positively based on 12 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 53 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating a mixed or average response.

<doc id="18350879" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18350879" title="Leheria">
Leheria

Leheria (or "leheriya") is a traditional style of tie dye practiced in Rajasthan, India that results in brightly colored cloth with distinctive patterns. The technique gets its name from the Rajasthani word for "wave" because the dyeing technique is often used to produce complex wave patterns.
Writing about textile crafts for "The Hindu", Mita Kapur asserts: "The famous leheriya (zigzag pattern of irregular colour stripes) is a visual invocation of the flow of water at the same time painstakingly showing the depths of indigo after multiple mud-resistant and dyeing processes. No small wonder that the blues in leheriya attract the eyes instinctively."
Technique.
Leheria dyeing is done on thin cotton or silk cloth, usually in lengths appropriate for turbans or saris. According to "World Textiles: A Visual Guide to Traditional Techniques", the fabric is "rolled diagonally from one corner to the opposite selvedge, and then tied at the required intervals and dyed". Wave patterns result from fanlike folds made before dyeing. Traditional leheria employs natural dyes and multiple washes and uses indigo or alizarin during the final stage of preparation.
Mothara.
An additional dyeing using the leheria technique produces "mothara". In the making of mothara, the original resists are removed and the fabric is re-rolled and tied along the opposite diagonal. This results in a checkered pattern with small undyed areas occurring at regular intervals. The undyed areas are about the size of a lentil, hence the name "mothara" ("moth" means lentil in Hindi).
Use.
Leheria turbans were a standard part of male business attire in Rajasthan during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Leheria is still produced in Jodhpur, Jaipur, Udaipur, and Nathdwara. It is offered for sale with most of its resist ties still in place as proof of authenticity, with a small portion of fabric unrolled to display its pattern.
Leheria occasionally appears in fashion collections, such as Designer Malini Ramani's beach collection in the Spring 2006 Delhi fashion show.

Relâche (ballet)

Relâche is a 1924 ballet by Francis Picabia with music composed by Erik Satie.
The title was thought to be a Dadaist practical joke, as "relâche" is the French word used on posters to indicate that a show is canceled, or the theater is closed. The first performance was indeed canceled, due to the illness of Jean Börlin, the principal dancer, choreographer, and artistic director of the Ballets suédois.
Picabia commissioned filmmaker René Clair to create a cinematic entr'acte to be shown during the ballet's intermission. The film, simply titled "Entr'acte", consists of a scene shown before the ballet and a longer piece between the acts. The nonsensical film features Picabia, Satie, and other well-known artists as actors.

The Kirchenpaueriidae are a hydrozoan family of the superfamily Plumularioidea. Their hydrocladia are characteristically set in an alternating fashion as one progresses along the stems, forming two neat rows except in "Oswaldella laertesi", which has three such rows. The alternating placement of the hydrocladia can be used to distinguish them from the Plumulariidae which may look superficially similar.

Riometer

A riometer ("r"elative "i"onospheric "o"pacity meter) (30 MHz) is an instrument used to quantify the amount of electromagnetic wave ionospheric absorption in the atmosphere. As the name implies, a riometer measures the ``opacity" of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from distant stars and galaxies. In the absence of any ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a "quiet-day curve." Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30 MHz).
The Riometer was developed in the mid 1950s by scientists at the University of Alaska who were researching the radio propagation effects of aurora. At times aurora resulted in complete failure of long distance radio communication to planes in the Arctic - a matter of considerable concern to the US Air Force at a time of tension with the Soviet Union.

Frazier Quarry

The Frazier Quarry Inc. (TFQ) is a large family owned quarry and stone product retailer based in the United States. The company is headquartered in Harrisonburg, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. It is the only producer of Shenandoah Valley Bluestone and also provides crushed stone and retail products. The company was founded in 1915 as Betts Quarry and became The Frazier Quarry Incorporated in 1946. The company is a third generation family owned business and derives its name from the owners. TFQ markets its products under its own brand name and also under Stonewall Grey which is for products cut and sawed on location and unique to TFQ.
History.
Beginning in 1915, TFQ has been a prominent business serving the Shenandoah Valley, both commercially and philanthropically. Frazier Quarry is one of the largest family owned and operated quarries operating in the United States. The quarry was founded to function as a cornerstone to the region by providing crushed stone for new construction projects and helping to expedite the growth of the Shenandoah Valley. The crushed stone production from TFQ has remained a reliable mainstay in construction projects in the area, and through years of improving practices and setting systems in place, the crushed stone production is operating stably and the quarry has begun other initiatives to supply the Valley with high grade stone products. The most notable new direction is the production of “The Valley’s Own Bluestone” which has helped to resurrect the region’s architectural legacy of Bluestone construction by once again providing it from a local source. Other aspects of the expansion are largely Do-It-Yourself (DIY) outdoor living or landscaping projects including: landscaping stone, all natural stone intraconvertible fire pits/fountain kits, flagstone, and solid stone garden benches. The DIY approach to the product line has allowed TFQ to offer low prices for high quality products through selling directly (not through middlemen) and creating products that do not require professional installation.
Historical Innovation.
Bluestone is an identifying characteristic of Shenandoah Valley architecture, beginning with the areas first settlers using the native stone from their own land for foundations and chimneys. It is a type of limestone that is so named because of its dark blue-grey color that will eventually weather to a light grey. Architects from the area had historically embraced the bluestone legacy and it was continued with the construction of major universities and important historical sites including the aptly named “Bluestone Campus” of James Madison University, the Virginia Military Institute, Washington and Lee University, Belle Grove Plantation, and the Stonewall Jackson Home. The obstacle that the architects of the aforementioned buildings faced was that there was no large bluestone quarry in Virginia, they had been forced to look further afield after their initial building projects (the first construction used stone from the projects' immediate vicinity) and transport their bulk amount of stone from Pennsylvania or New York. As costs began to rise with transporting such heavy materials and other fabricated materials such as brick and siding became more available, institutions were no longer able to afford to continue their bluestone legacy. Realizing that a vital piece of the area’s cultural paradigm had become out of reach, TFQ had a vision of restoring the Valley’s capabilities to honor its architectural stone foundation. The result of the vision was to bring the Valley’s Own Bluestone to a commercial scale with the Stonewall Grey product line from the Stonewall Division which debuted in early 2005. The stone’s name commemorates Stonewall Jackson and also demonstrates and pays homage to its close ties with the Shenandoah Valley. TFQ has been able to provide architectural bluestone to architects, builders, masons, and consumers more efficiently than ever as a result of their investment into the Valley through their ingenuitive and state-of-the art stone shop capable of providing custom stone dimensions to order. TFQ has orchestrated a kind of assimilation of eras that envelopes the Valley’s architectural past, its current technological growth, and its potential for the future.
Community involvement.
The Frazier Quarry has a large role in the Harrisonburg community. TFQ provides tours of the quarry to elementary school students and well as donates stone to community projects. Some examples of what the quarry has provided are: a stone garden to the local public television station, Stonewall Grey Split-Faced Stone to the downtown Harrisonburg Liberty Park, a natural stone fountain to the Harrisonburg Visitor's Center also known as the Hardesty-Higgins House, a custom inscribed Stonewall Grey Garden Bench to the local Harrisonburg High School, and also crushed stone for a local boy scout to use with his Eagle Scout project to build a therapeutic riding ring for disabled children.
Environmental consciousness.
The quarry collaborates with builders and contractors to place an emphasis on local stone, thereby reducing fuel costs on the shipping. It also researches how its stone can be utilized to construct LEED-certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) facilities, promoting both the use of all-natural building material. 
All Natural - a natural alternative to artificial and man-made building products.
High Calcium - neutralizes acids in streams, lakes, and soils.
Erosion Control - Large stone boulders "Rip Rap", help prevent and control erosion.
J-hooks - a novel use of rip rap in a stream or river to cause an eddy current/backwater that protects streambank ecosystems as specified by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland fisheries.
Riparian Buffer Zone - rip rap placed on river banks along with vegetation to slow flood waters.
AgLime.
Clean Air – Their low-emission quarry machinery utilizes Caterpillar’s revolutionary ACERT engines, high-performance engines that adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency’s required Tier 2 and Tier 3 restriction, while improving performance, durability, and fuel efficiency.
No Chemicals – there are no chemicals added during the process of quarrying and processing stone. Only petroleum fuel and lubricants are utilized for the machinery.
Recycled Oil – any waste oil and lubricants from the quarrying process are collected and burned in specially-designed furnaces to heat the shops during the winter. 
Land Reclamation – an ongoing process of reclaiming any disturbed land that has had the limestone extracted. They fill, re-grade, and re-vegetate those areas, creating such useful sites as parks, school grounds, agricultural land, arboretums, etc. 
Wildlife Preserves – TFQ preserves the natural habitats of the plant and animal life in these areas surrounding the quarry by keeping out trespassers, prohibiting hunting and off-road vehicles, and maintaining open fields of grasses and hay that are beneficial to the wildlife.

Velykyi Khodachkiv

Velykyi Khodachkiv (, , translit. "Velykyi Khodachkiv") - a selo in the Kozivskyi Raion, Ternopil oblast, Ukraine. It lies on the banks of the Rudka river, on the rail line from Ternopil to Rohatyn. The population is 1394 people (2003 census).
History.
The fist mentions of the village date back to 1758. On April 15, 1944 the Nazis killed 365 villagers, and almost totally razed the village. Of the 710 houses in the village only 30 were left standing.
From 1944-46 210 Ukrainian families from Poland were resettled there.
According to some Polish sources an ethnic cleaning operation called the Chodaczkow Wielki massacre ("Chodaczkow Wielki" is Polish for "Velykyi Khodachkiv") took place there during World War II. According to Polish historian, Grzegorz Hryciuk on April 16, 1944, the village have been destroyed by the Ukrainian 4th SS Police Regiment. The estimates of victims range from 250 to 854. One former Polish resident of Chodaczkow Wielki mentions that the Ukrainians told them to leave but did not mention any Poles being massacred or killed and did not mention the involvement of Ukrainian soldiers. Chodaczkow Wielki massacre is alleged to have been one of the biggest massacres of Poles in the region of Eastern Galicia.
Poles who escaped the massacre buried the dead in a communal grave, in front of the local Roman Catholic church. After the World War II, Polish survivors were forced to leave the village, deported by the Soviet authorities to new communist Poland. They settled as a group around Gogolin and Niemodlin in the Opole Voivodeship.
However, Soviet sources state that the village was the site of heavy fighting between Soviet Army and Wehrmacht precisely on the very same date of the alleged massacre.

EcoLogic Development Fund

EcoLogic, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with a Four Star Charity Navigator Rating, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States, advances conservation of critical natural resources in rural Latin America by promoting sustainable livelihoods and strengthening community participation in environmental stewardship. EcoLogic was established to fulfill a mandate voiced by indigenous and environmental leaders at the 1992 Earth Summit to reduce the destruction of significant tropical ecosystems by advancing economic development and self-determination among communities living in and around threatened habitats. EcoLogic partners with local organizations to promote community-based management of forests and coastal ecosystems, often at the level of microwatersheds; direct water sources and the land cover that helps recharge and clean the water. Since 1993, EcoLogic has provided direct technical and financial assistance to over 5,000 rural communities and has helped to protect 2,000 water sources throughout Latin America.
Mission and Motivation.
Mission.
The Ecologic Development Fund is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the conservation of critical natural resources in rural areas of Latin America by promoting sustainable livelihoods and by strengthening community participation in natural resource management.
The Impact of Poverty on Biodiversity.
Latin America is home to some of the greatest biodiversity of plants and animals but also some of the poorest people in the western hemisphere. Ecologic is motivated by the belief that resource use associated with conditions of poverty (slash and burn agriculture, clearcutting, overfishing) places tremendous pressure on fragile ecosystems. Similar threats are posed by ecologically unsustainable activities in mining, agribusiness, and oil exploration. It is the balance between human needs and environmental imperatives that Ecologic finds most compelling in addressing the future of the planet. In its 2007 State of the World's Forests report, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization found that in the last 15 years, Latin America has lost over of forest. Central America alone has lost 19%, the largest percentage for the region. This habitat devastation accelerates the loss of species, endangers critical sources of safe water, and contributes the massive release of greenhouse gases that exacerbates global warming.
Mitigating climate change.
Ecologic's approach to the anticipated challenges of climate change is to plant and protect trees that store the carbon dioxide our society produces (CO2 sequestration). Tropical forests having been identified as especially effective areas to serve this function, Ecologic's conservation efforts in the heavily forested areas of Latin America are leading the way in the introduction of sequestration as a solution to local conservation efforts and global environmental well-being. Producing and selling carbon credits benefits poor, rural communities by employing individuals in the planting and maintenance of millions of trees each year. Linking global market demand for forest resources to the communities Ecologic and its partners serve helps halt destructive land-use practices that severely decrease the Earth's capacity to absorb greenhouse gases, protect water, prevent erosion, and support life. 
Community self-determination.
EcoLogic takes a people-centered approach to the conservation of tropical and semi-tropical habitats, holding that conservation efforts too often impose restrictions that fail to take into account the needs of people living in and around threatened areas. A goal of long-term, effective stewardship requires understanding and integrating local needs. Additionally, Ecologic recognizes that local people are often excluded from important decisions regarding their land, resulting in resource extraction from which they see little benefit. Thus, Ecologic employs a strategy of community-led resource management by encouraging those closest to the land to steward resources that meet their needs and in ways that are ecologically compatible.

The red road

The red road is a concept of the right path of life, as inspired by some of the beliefs found in a variety of Native American spiritual teachings.
Native Americans' spiritual teachings are diverse, and while there are sometimes common elements, the ceremonies and many of the beliefs are unique to the people of these diverse bands, tribes and nations.
Black Elk.
The concept was first brought to non-native American audiences by John G. Neihardt, in his book Black Elk Speaks. Though Black Elk (1863–1950) was Oglala Lakota, the book was authored by Neihardt, who is non-Native. While lauded by non-Native audiences, and inspirational to many New Age groups, the book is largely considered to not be representative of actual Lakota beliefs. Neidhardt claimed that Black Elk believed he had an obligation to "help to bring my people back into the sacred hoop, that they might again walk the red road in a sacred manner pleasing to the powers of the universe that are one power."
"Hear me, four quarters of the world--a relative I am! Give me the strength to walk the soft earth, a relative to all that is! Give me the eyes to see and the strength to understand, that I may be like you. With your power only can I face the winds.<br>
Great Spirit, Great Spirit, my Grandfather, all over the earth the faces of living things are all alike. With tenderness have these come up out of the ground. Look upon these faces of children without number and with children in their arms, that they may face the wind and walk the good road to the day of quiet.<br>
This is my prayer; hear me!"
- "Black Elk's Prayer for All Life"
Healing and recovery.
In some modern, Pan-Indian or New Age healing systems the idea of the Red Road plays part of the recovery process from illness, spiritual sickness, and addictions: Through "the Sweat lodge, the Red Road, and the Recovery Medicine Wheel."
Concern for the cost of severing one's relationship with the earth has been echoed by many modern, leading Western thinkers such as Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, as well as the environmental movement. The phrase is "The Red Road" has been picked up by many non-Native American writers, with possible New Age appropriations or their own ideas of what they think Native American ceremonies are like. 
American Indian author Vine Deloria, Jr. wrote:
"The first and great difference between primitive religious thought and the world religions ... is that primitive peoples maintain an air of mystery through their bond with nature; the world religions sever the relationship and attempt to establish a new, more comprehensible one."

George Stone (pitcher)

George Heard Stone (July 9, 1946, in Ruston, Louisiana), is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. He is likely best remembered for his season with the New York Mets, when he went 12-3 with a 2.80 ERA to help lead the Mets to the 1973 World Series.
Atlanta Braves.
Stone played college baseball and basketball for Louisiana Tech, and was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft. After two seasons in the Braves' farm system, in which he went 16-9 with a 2.51 earned run average, he reached the majors as a September call-up in . He made his major league debut on September 15 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, and lasted just a third of an inning and giving up three earned runs against the Chicago Cubs.
After starting the season in the minors, Stone reached the majors again that July. Though he had been used primarily as a starting pitcher in the minors, he was used primarily out of the bullpen when he first joined the Braves. By August, however, he had earned a spot in the starting rotation, and went 7-3 as a starter his rookie season.
Stone was 13-10 with a 3.65 ERA for the National League West champions in . He made just one appearance in the 1969 National League Championship Series, pitching one inning in the third, and final, game against the Mets.
New York Mets.
Stone was unpopular with Mets fans for hitting Rusty Staub with a pitch at Shea Stadium on June 3, . That didn't prevent the Mets from dealing Danny Frisella and Gary Gentry for him and Félix Millán following the season. As with the Braves, he began his career with the Mets as a relief pitcher, going 1-0 with a save and a 0.60 ERA before being added to the starting rotation. Though he lost his first two starts, Stone proved an invaluable addition to the Mets' starting rotation, winning his last eight decisions, as the Mets came from 12.5 games back to win the National League East.
Stone started game four of the 1973 NLCS, going 6.2 inning and giving up one run before giving way to the bullpen. The Cincinnati Reds won the game in twelve innings, however, the Mets won game five to head to the World Series. Stone was used out of the bullpen in the 1973 World Series, appearing in games two and seven. There is a controversy over the fact that manager Yogi Berra started Tom Seaver in game 6 instead of George Stone. The Mets had a 3 games to 2 lead over the Oakland Athletics and Seaver lost game six on three days rest. Had George Stone pitched game 6, Seaver could have pitched game 7 well rested. Instead the A's won the last two games to win the world series. 
Stone was unable to match his early success with the Mets, going 5-10 with a 5.04 ERA in & . He ended up tearing his rotator cuff, and was not as effective as he had once been. Following the 1975 season, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for Bill Hands, however, he never made an appearance with the Rangers. He retired from baseball instead.

Synopsis.
Shrewish husband V.S. Shrewd wife
<br>
A bond between justice and affection
Career-minded court judge Ko Hei Man (Jessica Hsuan), receives full support from her husband Kot Kwok Kwong (Sunny Chan) so that she is able to fully concentrate on her work. The couple even have a son named Ah B. At court, Man believes everyone is equal before the law and she tackles every challenge confidently. At home, Man never bothers with the household duties which are taken care of by her husband.
When Ho Sau Sau (Joyce Tang) meets Man, they get along well and become friends. Along the way, Man also meets Ho Shi Fu (Benz Hui), a greedy but well-meaning man. Fu had gotten sued a multiple number of times, leaving Man with a bad impression of him. Unknown to Fu, Sau is his daughter that he kicked out of his house when she was a just a child, along with her mother. When Fu realizes this, he tries to earn her forgiveness. However, a DNA test reveals that Sau and Man were switched when they were babies and that Fu is actually the father of Man.
At first, Man is unable to accept Fu as her father, refusing to believe that she is related to such a horrible man. Fu, wanting Man to accept him, makes some changes to his lifestyle to become a better person. He secretly follows Man around and helps her when she needs it. Seeing that he has changed for the better, Man finally calls him "dad." The father and daughter catch the eye of newspapers and journalists, leading to many court trials, misunderstandings, as well as the stress of being followed by photographers everywhere. This leads Fu to think of himself as a burden to Man, resulting in him leaving for mainland China.
While this happens, Sau sees how happy Man's life is and begins to become jealous. Due to her slight mental problems, Sau starts to think that Man is out to get her and she begins to plot to take away everything which she thinks is rightfully hers. When Kwong contracts a brain tumor, Sau convinces him not to tell Man until he's sure if its fatal or not. When Man leaves for mainland China to search for Fu, Kwong takes this opportunity to get his brain tumor checked, all the while hiding it from his wife. Sau begins copying Man: wearing a wig, taking her clothes, borrowing her perfume and lipstick, and even addresses herself as Kwong's wife.
When Man gets back, she starts to become concerned over Sau's sudden obsessive desire to be like her. They try to bring in a mental specialist, but all this does is give Sau a mental breakdown and she storms away in rage. After bringing her back home, Kot Tak Wan (Johnson Lee), Kwong's relative, manages to cheer her up and bring back her self-confidence.
Kwong's brain tumor report comes out and he is given the choice of removing it. However, there is a chance he might forget everything. Due to this, Kwong refuses to do the operation, scared he might forget Man and Ah B. Due to the side-effects of the brain tumor, Kwong constantly faints as well as forgets simple things like when he had breakfast. Man tries her best to convince Kwong to do the surgery but he refuses to do it and tells Man to stop pressuring him. Left with no choice, Man declares a divorce. At their divorce hearing, Man tells the judge that to accept Kwong's future death, she must go back to her previous way of life, before she was married.
The next day, Man gets a hold of a disc that Kwong made to show their son when he's dead. Man is deeply touched and makes a disc of her own to convince Kwong do the operation. Kwong sees it and at the next divorce hearing, they come to realize the other person's perspective and Kwong finally decides to do the surgery. In the end, Kwong's surgery is revealed to be successful, and the whole family laughs as they celebrate Ah B's 4th birthday.

His Phillies clubs lost 106 (), 103 (), 111 (), and 109 () games, and his White Sox team dropped 101 games (). He did appear in five games for the 1946 Phillies, who lost only 85 of 154 games that season. He is also known for having severely beaned star Brooklyn Dodgers outfielder Pete Reiser in April 1941 — one of a series of injuries that derailed Reiser's promising career.

You (vessel)

A you () is a lidded vessel that was used for liquid offerings by the Chinese of the Zhou and Shang Dynasties. It sometimes lacks taotie in favor of smoother surfaces. Sometimes these vessels are zoomorphic, especially in the form of two owls back to back. Usually the handle of the you is in the form of a loop that attaches on either side of the lid, but it is occasionally a knob in the center of the lid. They can be quadruped or have a single base.

Heino Meyer-Bahlburg

Heino F. L. Meyer-Bahlburg is a German-born psychologist best known for his work on biology of sexual orientation, gender identity, intersexuality, and HIV.
Education and career.
Meyer-Bahlburg earned his Diplom from University of Hamburg in 1966 and his Dr. rer. nat. in Psychology from University of Düsseldorf in 1970. He took a position at State University of New York, Buffalo and at Children’s Hospital in Buffalo, New York in 1970. Since 1977 he has held appointments at New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University where he has been Professor of Clinical Psychology since 1990. In 1978, he took a position at New York Presbyterian Hospital and has been a Full Professional Psychologist there since 1990. Since 1987, he has been affiliated with the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies.
Meyer-Bahlburg believes homosexuality may be an issue of brain chemistry. He has observed that women who took the synthetic estrogen Diethylstilbestrol when pregnant were more likely to have daughters with bisexual or homosexual tendencies. His research interests include the effect of biological factors, medical treatments, gender assignment, and rearing conditions in the development of gender-related behavior, temperament, sexual orientation, and gender identity in various forms of intersexuality. He has published on the effect of genital ambiguity and genital surgery on later sexual functioning in 46,XX congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Meyer-Bahlburg published with John Money and others on the topic of psychoneuroendocrinology and its effects on sexual orientation and gender identity. In collaboration with Dr. Maria New, Meyer-Bahlburg published a long term analysis of the psychological effects of the use of prenatal dexamethasone to treat Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. 
Meyer-Bahlburg served on the American Psychiatric Association DSM-III Gender Identity Disorder Committee, and the DSM-IV Subcommittee on Gender Identity Disorders. He was also Adviser to the Sexual Disorder Text Revision Work Group for DSM-IV-TR. He treats gender identity disorder in children, taking about ten cases a year in the 1990s. He has written that gender identity depends largely on postnatal environmental influences, while sex-dimorphic behavior and temperamental sex differences appear to be modified by prenatal sex hormones. Meyer-Bahlburg notes that when parents bring in children for treatment, the “basic fear in this homophobic country is usually homosexuality."
His research interests in the field of HIV include psychosexual assessment, development and determinants of sexual risk behavior, and the effects of HIV on sexual functioning.
Meyer-Bahlburg was President of the International Academy of Sex Research from 1990 to 1991 and since 2002 has served on the Committee on Intersexuality for the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association.

CENDI

CENDI (Commerce, Energy, NASA, Defense Information Managers Group) is an interagency group of senior Scientific and Technical Information (STI) managers from 14 United States federal agencies. CENDI managers cooperate by exchanging information and ideas, collaborating to address common issues, and undertaking joint initiatives. CENDI's accomplishments range from impacting federal information policy to educating a broad spectrum of stakeholders on all aspects of federal STI systems, including its value to research and the taxpayer, and to operational improvements in agency and interagency STI operations.
History.
CENDI traces its roots to the Committee on Scientific and Technical Information (COSATI) of the Federal Council on Science and Technology. COSATI was established in the early 1960s to coordinate the management of the results from the U.S. government's increasing commitment to scientific research and technology development. The scientific and technical information (STI) managers of the government's major research and development (R&D) agencies worked within COSATI to standardize guidelines for cataloging and indexing technical reports. COSATI ceased formal operations in the early 1970s.
To continue the cooperation begun under COSATI, managers of agency STI programs from Commerce (National Technical Information Service), Energy (Office of Scientific and Technical Information), NASA (HQ/STI Division), and Defense (Defense Technical Information Center) began meeting periodically to discuss common topics and stimulate more effective cooperation. 
In 1985, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the four charter agencies and CENDI was established. From this small core of STI managers, CENDI has grown to its current membership, which represents the major science agencies, the national libraries, and agencies involved in the dissemination and long-term management of scientific and technical information.
The vision of CENDI is to facilitate cooperative enterprise where capabilities are shared and challenges are faced together so that the sum of the accomplishments is greater than each individual agency can achieve on its own amongst federal STI agencies.
The abbreviation CENDI refers to the "Commerce, Energy, NASA, Defense Information Managers Group".
Membership.
New members from other federal R&D information organizations may be admitted by unanimous agreement of the members. However, it is the intent of the group that membership in CENDI should remain small and focus on organizations with STI or supporting responsibilities. Each agency provides funding to CENDI. 
Current members.
The current members of CENDI are:
Mission and operation.
CENDI's mission is to help improve the productivity of federal science- and technology-based programs through effective scientific, technical, and related information support systems. In fulfilling its mission, CENDI agencies play an important role in addressing science- and technology-based national priorities and strengthening U.S. competitiveness.

CENDI is made up of senior federal STI managers and each organization appoints a Principal representative. This person is the point of contact for that organization within CENDI. Each Principal has an Alternate. The Principals and Alternates comprise the main group that meets on a regular basis, usually every other month.
Secretariat.
A Tennessee-based information management company, -- Information International Associates, Inc., currently serves as the CENDI Secretariat. The Secretariat provides day-to-day operations to CENDI. The Secretariat prepares the necessary materials for the Principals' meetings, provides support for the working group and task group meetings, assists in developing papers, and maintains the CENDI files and outreach tools. 
Task Groups and Working Groups.
The chair(s) of a working group is appointed by the Principals and has the overall responsibility for the group's activities. The Secretariat provides support at the request of the Working Group chair(s). 
The Working Groups and Task Groups that are currently operating are: 
Science.gov and Worldwidescience.org.
In 2001, in response to the April 2001 workshop on "Strengthening the Public Information Infrastructure for Science", and taking into consideration a request from Firstgov (now USA.gov) to develop specialized topical portals, CENDI formed an alliance to develop an interagency website for access to STI. This website, called Science.gov, is a one-stop source of STI, including both selected, authoritative government websites and deep Web databases of technical reports, journal articles, conference proceedings, and other published materials. Through the volunteer efforts of members and involving over 100 staff, content and architecture is developed for the site. The Science.gov website is hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI). The site was formally launched in December 2002. As a result of the success of Science.gov, under DOE leadership and in cooperation with the International Council of Scientific and Technical Information, a worldwide coordination across national portals called WorldWideScience was launched in 2008.
Work with non-member organizations.
CENDI works with several cooperating non-member organizations on a regular basis. These agencies are in academia, federal government, legal and policy analysis, international, non-governmental, and private organizations.

Baratashvili

Baratashvili () is a Georgian noble family, appearing at the end of the 15th century as a continuation of the Kachibadze (ქაჩიბაძე), which were possibly related to the Liparitids-Orbeli. 
The surname "Baratashvili", literally “children/descendants of Barata”, derives from the 15th-century nobleman Barata “the Great” Kachibadze. The Kachibadze are first attested in the early 14th century inscription from the Pitareti monastery and, according to the Georgian scholar Simon Janashia, originated in Abkhazia. 
Early in the 16th century, the Baratashvili estates, known as Sabaratiano, included hundreds of villages with 2,500-3,000 peasant households and some 250-300 noble vassals in Lower Kartli in the south of Georgia. They had castles at Samshvilde, Dmanisi, Darbaschala, Tbisi and Enageti; and familial abbeys at Pitareti, Gudarekhi, Dmanisi and Kedi. They were listed among the top five great nobles, tavadi, of the Kingdom of Kartli and played a prominent role in the political and cultural life of Georgia; they were High Constables of Somkhiti-Sabaratiano, and also majordomos and Lords Chief Justice at the royal court. In the 16th and 17th centuries, several noble houses sprung off the Baratashvili. These were: 
The main Baratashvili line gradually declined and lost their privileges to their own offshoot Qaplanishvili. A branch of the Baratashvili, Barataev (Баратаевы), was also established in Russia by an expatriate prince Melkisedek (Mikhail), who followed King Vakhtang VI in his Russian emigration in 1724. Melkisedek Baratashvili, now known as Mikhail Barataev, entered Russian service. Of his four sons, two – Pyotr and Semyon – became generals in the Russian army and governors of Siberia and Kazan, respectively. His daughters married into Russian nobility. Pyotr Barataev’s son, Prince Mikhail Barataev, was a Privy Counsellor better known as an archeologist and numismatist of Georgia.
After Russian annexation of Georgia, the Georgian Baratashvili were confirmed among the princely nobility (knyaz Baratov, Баратовы) in the decrees of 1826, 1827, 1829, and 1850.

World War I service.
She was acquired by the U.S. Navy from Luckenbach Steamship Co. and placed in service 29 August 1917 as SP–982. Through World War I she served as a section patrol craft in the 5th Naval District, operating in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and the Elizabeth River. and in Italian waters during the remainder of World War I. 
She also served in Europe, and suffered a fire off Villa Franca, Italy, on 5 October 1918 that took the life of one person.
World War II service.
Shortly after World War I she was redesignated YT–42 and assigned harbor duties in the 3rd Naval District. She was slated for replacement in 1939, but war extended her period of use to the Navy. Through World War II she continued to serve the Fleet as a tug in New York Harbor.
Final decommissioning.
Redesignated YTB 42 in May 1944, "Penobscot" remained active until 29 October 1945, when she was placed out of service at New York City. Struck from the Navy List 17 April 1946, she was turned over to the U.S. Maritime Commission 31 January 1947 for disposal.

Nathaniel Cotton

Nathaniel Cotton (1707 – 2 August 1788) was an English physician and poet.
Cotton is thought to have studied at Leiden University, possibly under Herman Boerhaave. Cotton specialised in the care of patients with mental health issues, maintaining an asylum known as the Collegium Insanorum, at St Albans. William Cowper was one of his patients and held Cotton in high regard. 
Cotton was also a published poet, whose poems were described by Cheever as "full of good sense, benevolence, and piety" although not works of genius. He was the author of "Visions in Verse", first published in 1751; and a two volume complete collection of his works was published in 1791.
He was married twice, first in 1738 to Anne Pembroke, with whom he had eight children, six of whom survived past infancy and one, Joseph Cotton, who became a director of the Honourable East India Company. His second marriage in 1750 or 51 was to Hannah Everett, with whom he had a son and two daughters. He died at St Albans on 2 August 1788 and is buried in St. Peter's churchyard.

Mikhail Barataev

Mikhail Petrovich Barataev (, ) (January 1, 1784 – July 30, 1856) was a Russian bureaucrat of Georgian origin and an amateur numismatist, the first to have studied the coinage of Georgia. 
Barataev was born in Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk) into the expatriate Georgian noble family of Baratashvili. His father, Prince Pyotr Mikhailovich Barataev (1734-1789), was a general in the Russian army and Simbirsk governor. His mother came of the Russian untitled noble family of Nazimov. He served as an artillery officer from 1798 to 1809 and retired with wounds received in the Napoleonic Wars. From 1820 to 1835, Barataev was a head of nobility of the Simbirsk governorate. He founded a Freemasonic lodge "Key to Virtues" (Ключ к добродетели) in Simbirsk and was briefly arrested in 1826 for his ties with the Decembrists. 
In 1839, Barataev was appointed a director of the customs department in Georgia. During his tenure in the Caucasus, Barataev became interested in numismatics and collected a unique collection of Georgian coins. Upon his retirement in 1844, Barataev published, in French and Russian, his principal study "The Numismatic Facts of the Kingdom of Georgia" (Russian: Нумизматические факты грузинского царства; French: "Documents numismatiques du Royaume de Géorgie") – the first scholarly treatment of the subject in question – which won him a membership of the French Academy of Sciences.

Frank A. Haskell

Franklin Aretas Haskell (July 13, 1828 – June 3, 1864) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War who was killed during the Battle of Cold Harbor. Haskell wrote a famous account of the Battle of Gettysburg that was published posthumously.
Early life.
Haskell was born at Tunbridge, Vermont to Aretas and Anna E. Folsom Haskell. He moved to Wisconsin to study law in the office of his brother Harrison. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1854, and returned to Madison, Wisconsin to practice law. During this period, Haskell became the drill master of a militia company.
Civil War.
When the Civil War began, Haskell enlisted in Col. Lysander Cutler's 6th Wisconsin Infantry of Brig. Gen. Rufus King's Brigade. This brigade would eventually be known as the Iron Brigade. He served as adjutant for the regiment with the rank of first lieutenant until April 1862, when he was made aide-de-camp for Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, the new Commander of the Iron Brigade. While with the Iron Brigade, Haskell saw action during the Northern Virginia Campaign and the Maryland Campaign. When Gibbon was promoted to command of the 2nd Division, I Corps, Haskell went with him and remained his aide. This division saw action at the Battle of Fredericksburg. After Gibbon suffered a wound at Fredericksburg, he took time off to recuperate and had been replaced in command of his division. He was given command of the 2nd Division, II Corps and again Haskell remained his aide. This division saw action during the Chancellorsville Campaign.
Gettysburg.
Gibbon's Division headed north toward Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign and was in Taneytown, Maryland when the Battle of Gettysburg began. Gibbon was given temporary command of II Corps after I Corps Commander Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds was killed and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade ordered II Corps Commander Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock to Gettysburg to assume command. Haskell and II Corps did not arrive on the battlefield until July 2, 1863. There they took part in the defense of Cemetery Ridge, the area around the Nicholas Codori Farm, and supported the III Corps of Daniel E. Sickles in their defense of the Peach Orchard. In his recollections of the Battle, Haskell was highly critical of Sickles as a soldier and a person as well as his move forward that led to his III Corps being attacked by the Confederates. That night, Gibbon took part in a council of war called by Meade which Haskell recorded in his recollections of the Battle. On July 3, Gibbon was back in command of his division and Haskell was by his side. Late that morning, Gibbon hosted a meal for much of the Union high command which Haskell also recorded for posterity. Shortly after the luncheon broke up Confederate artillery began to shell the area where Gibbon's men were positioned. Gibbon's position bore the brunt of the Confederate attack known as Pickett's Charge. Haskell rallied Gibbon's men after the Confederates had breached the stone wall and Gibbon had been wounded. Hancock, Gibbon, Brig. Gen.William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Col. A.F. Devereux (19th Mass.) commended Haskell for his performance, with Gibbon later writing that "I have always thought that to him, more than to any one man, are we indebted for the repulse of Lee's assault."
A few weeks after the Battle, Haskell wrote the account of what he had experienced at Gettysburg to his brother Harrison in Portage, Wisconsin. At the time, Harrison could not even get a newspaper to publish the account. Haskell's account would be published in 1898 as a book called "The Battle of Gettysburg." This account was hailed by Bruce Catton as "One of the genuine classics of Civil War literature."
Gibbon and Haskell returned to Gettysburg in November 1863 to attend the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery and witnessed President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address after recreating their role in the battle for some tourists on Cemetery Ridge.
Death.
On February 9, 1864, Haskell was appointed colonel of the 36th Wisconsin. On June 3, he assumed command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, II Corps when its commander Col. Henry Boyd McKeen was killed during the Battle of Cold Harbor. Shortly after taking command he was shot through the temple and killed while leading a charge. A distraught Gibbon cried out: "My God! I have lost my best friend, and one of the best soldiers in the Army of the Potomac has fallen!" Gibbon wrote to his wife that he had planned to promote "poor Haskell" to field command after the battle.
Haskell's "Battle of Gettysburg" in Popular Culture.
Haskell's account is reprinted in volume 43, "American Historical Documents", of "The Harvard Classics".
In "The Killer Angels", the novel by Michael Shaara, part 4 ("Friday, July 3, 1863"), chapter 3 ("Chamberlain"), Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain goes to see Gen. Sykes, his corps commander, where there is a lunch for the senior commanders, and is finally taken some chicken by Lt. Haskell himself. That lunch is from Haskell's account.
In "The Civil War", the documentary by Ken Burns, the subtitle of Episode 5, "The Universe of Battle", comes from Haskell's account, where, shortly after the lunch, he and Gen. Gibbon are sitting, watching the great cannonade of the third day. During "Gettysburg: The Third Day", Garrison Keillor reads a relevant excerpt.

Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote of the album "Dave Van Ronk's approach to performing traditional folk songs and blues tunes is sufficiently unusual to require a sleeve note from the singer to justify it. Unlike other white, Northern, urban folksingers, who perform such material but do so in their own natural voices, Van Ronk takes much of his style from the black, Southern, rural singers who have performed it before him... he can sing in a way that serves the material and, despite the attempt at imitation, comes off as his own individual sound."

Protein synthesis inhibitor

A protein synthesis inhibitor is a substance that stops or slows the growth or proliferation of cells by disrupting the processes that lead directly to the generation of new proteins.
While a broad interpretation of this definition could be used to describe nearly any antibiotic, in practice, it usually refers to substances that act at the ribosome level (either the ribosome itself or the translation factor), taking advantages of the major differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosome structures.
Toxins such as ricin also function via protein synthesis inhibition. Ricin acts at the eukaryotic 60S.
Examples:
Mechanism.
In general, protein synthesis inhibitors work at different stages of prokaryotic mRNA translation into proteins, like initiation, elongation (including aminoacyl tRNA entry, proofreading, peptidyl transfer, and ribosomal translocation) and termination:

Winter in America

Winter in America is a studio album by American recording artist Gil Scott-Heron and musician Brian Jackson, released in May 1974 on Strata-East Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during September to October 1973 at D&B Sound Studio in Silver Spring, Maryland. It contains introspective and socially conscious lyrics by Scott-Heron that reflect on African-American culture at the time of the album's conception. While Jackson's piano-based arrangements are rooted in jazz and the blues, their stripped-down production for the album resulted in a reliance on more traditional African and R&B sounds.
The album serves as Scott-Heron's and Jackson's debut release for Strata-East Records, following a dispute with their former label and departure. It proved to be their sole release for the independent jazz label. Upon its release, "Winter in America" featured limited distribution in the United States and quickly became rare in print. However, with promotional help from its only single "The Bottle", it obtained considerably larger commercial success than Scott-Heron's and Jackson's previous work. The album debuted at number six on "Billboard"s Top Jazz Albums chart and ultimately sold over 300,000 copies in the United States. 
While it was critically overlooked upon its release, "Winter in America" earned retrospective acclaim from several writers and music critics as Scott-Heron's and Jackson's greatest work together. Along with its critical recognition, it has been noted by several critics for its influence on derivative music forms such as neo soul and hip hop music, as many artists of the genres have been influenced by Scott-Heron's and Jackson's lyrical and musical approach on the album. On March 10, 1998, "Winter in America" was reissued on compact disc for the first time in the United States through Scott-Heron's Rumal-Gia Records.
Background.
After leaving his former label Flying Dutchman Records, Gil Scott-Heron signed with the New York City jazz-based Strata-East label in early 1973, accompanied by jazz keyboardist and songwriter Brian Jackson, with whom he had worked with on his previous studio albums, "Pieces of a Man" (1971) and "Free Will" (1972). While some sources allege this may have been over financial or creative differences, Scott-Heron maintains the switch was due to producer Bob Thiele's unwillingness to give Jackson co-billing. By the time of their move to Strata-East, Scott-Heron and Jackson had achieved underground notice among R&B and soul music listeners, particularly for the political and social nature of their music's themes, as well as Scott-Heron's emphasis on African-American culture and social plight in his compositions. Their musical fusion of jazz, blues, soul and spoken word styles helped them earn some notice among less-mainstream black music listeners at the time. 
Social circumstances and musical events preceded Scott-Heron's and Jackson's signing with Strata-East. After the decline of popularity in traditional jazz forms and the civil rights struggle, which had sought racial equality during the late 1950s and 1960s, black pride and Afrocentric sentiment by many black Americans emerged. During 1970 to 1974, the Black Panthers organization had been neutralized and pan-Africanism came into vogue. Following the free jazz and avant-garde breakthroughs of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, a creative stasis among most jazz musicians set in during the decade that led to an eclecticism where no style or conception of jazz maintained a zeitgeist among players. However, jazz fusion had gained mainstream notice for its stylistic adoption of rock and funk music, despite being the subject of controversy in jazz purist circles. Highlighted by the works of Roy Ayers, Herbie Hancock, and Donald Byrd, jazz-funk also emerged in response to the growing popularity of funk, leading to a trend of funk rhythms among jazz musicians formerly of the hard bop tradition as an attempt to reconnect with their African-American audience. This factored into the popularity of Scott-Heron's and Jackson's work in the black underground scene, with the former obtaining a reputation as a "street poet", while his work with Jackson served as an early recording of jazz poetry.
Record label.
Scott-Heron had looked to expand on his socially conscious, pro black-oriented themes and independently produce a more conceptual album than his previous work had envisioned. Scott-Heron's and Jackson's search for more creative control over their recordings prompted them to sign with Strata-East Records. Established in 1971 by jazz musicians Charles Tolliver and Stanley Cowell, in response to major record companies' lack of interest in their recordings, the Strata-East label had become known for signing artists who recorded with diverse styles of jazz music with themes of social consciousness and black nationalism, as well as "minimal but eye-grabbing graphic design" for its releases. 
The label had also been known for carrying out the management concept of "condominium". Originally conceived and penned by Cowell, it gave artists authority and responsibility over their recorded material independently, as well as the ability to assign the master tapes over to the label for distribution. Strata-East artists had more control over their recordings than major labels at the time had offered. Music journalist Kevin Moist later wrote of the label's "condominium" concept, "The idea was to try and develop an independent cultural space outside of the mainstream that could function self-sufficiently and be genuinely participatory for its members. The goal was to live in an engaged way where art, society, spirituality, and politics could all come together holistically in an integrated existence. That (sub)cultural renewal is embodied in the kind of music midwifed by Strata-East." The label's philosophy for artist management and recording ethic worked to the advantage of artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson. Scott-Heron and Jackson were able to release more aesthetically personalized recordings for Strata-East than most mainstream labels would allow.
Recording.
To record the album, Jackson suggested a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions took place in September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D&B Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself. 
The recording sessions served as the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for "All About Jazz", stating "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it."
In contrast to their Flying Dutchman recordings and subsequent Arista recordings, "Winter in America" utilized a sparse production quality and small number of sessions musicians. A small supporting line-up, featuring drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, contributed on a few cuts. Adams and Bowens, who studied with Scott-Heron at Lincoln University, arrived from the Pennsylvania-based college on the last day of recording on October 15, 1973. Scott-Heron and Jackson handled most of the vocals, songwriting, and instrumentation, and they were assisted by Williams with the production. 
The September 4 and 5 sessions featured only Jackson and Scott-Heron playing and recording. The limited personnel during these sessions allowed them to rely mostly on traditional African and R&B sounds and influences, along with more creative and artistic control of the project. More than half of the album's songs were co-written and produced by Jackson. His input also helped solidify his partnership with Scott-Heron, leading to further records together before their split in 1978.
Title significance.
The original name of the album was intended to be "Supernatural Corner", named after the cover art, but was later changed to "Winter in America" by Scott-Heron. Both the title and the song "Supernatural Corner" were left off the album, as the name would not be understandable to people who have not seen the house to which the title was alluding to. According to Gil Scott-Heron, the original title referred to what appeared to him to be a haunted house in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in which Scott-Heron and Jackson moved into prior to recording in 1973. The cover artwork features a collage-type painting with oriental graphic designs and a small figure version of whom appears to be Brian Jackson. It was created by Eugene Coles, a friend and colleague of Jackson's and Scott-Heron's from the historically black college Morgan State University. "Supernatural Corner" by Coles was used as the album's cover art, as Scott-Heron had originally commissioned Coles to design the collage. 
The revised title of "Winter in America" was intended to represent Scott-Heron's use of the season of winter as a metaphor and concept of his view of the issues facing society during his time. The title was also meant to represent the urban sociological themes featured on the album, which had surfaced on most of Scott-Heron's previous work. Scott-Heron referred to the title as the "overall atmosphere of the album", as well as the metaphor for the overall theme of the album. "Winter" was conceived amid social, economic and political issues in the United States during the early 1970s, including stagflation, the 1973 oil crisis that had great effect during the winter, the 1973 stock market crash, the Watergate scandal, and urban decay. He further elaborated on the social concept of winter and Afrocentricism, as it relates to living during times such as these and how the title reflects on the time itself, in the original LP liner notes:
In a February 2009 interview with Jalylah Burrell of "Vibe" magazine, Gil Scott-Heron discussed the album's concept and title, as well as the social and political atmosphere at the time of "Winter in America"s recording. In retrospect, he stated "We felt as though we had come across something that people did not understand or did not recognize but that's the season that we were going into, not for three months but for an extended period of time. A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was the folks in charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..."
Music and lyrics.
Similar to his studio debut album "Pieces of a Man", "Winter in America" has Scott-Heron exercising his baritone and deep tenor-singing abilities with some spoken-word elements. The album served as a move into more conventional song structures, in contrast to the Scott-Heron's debut live album, "A New Black Poet - Small Talk at 125th and Lenox" (1970), which was composed entirely of spoken-word poetry, and the rapping style of his previous album "Free Will". According to music writer Karl Keely, "Pieces of a Man" and "Winter in America" exhibit further departure by Scott-Heron from his prominent "angry and militant poet" persona. BBC Online writer Daryl Easlea wrote that it "captures Scott Heron at a turning point, largely leaving his heavier raps behind in favour of a floating ambience, with his poetry and song being illuminated by Jackson's superb instrumentation". In addition, the album features more themes of social commentary, Afrocentrism and balladry than "Pieces of a Man". "Winter in America" features a more stripped-down production and melancholy mood along with songs that exceeded four minutes, as opposed to "Free Will", which was criticized for its brevity and time constraints.
Scott-Heron's characteristic sound on the album is rooted in the blues, jazz, and soul music. He referred to his mellow fusion of style as "bluesology, the science of how things feel." Scott-Heron's and Jackson's compositions for "Winter in America" incorporate elements of African music, heavy percussion, and chants. They also feature scene-setting, spoken word intros and mystical interludes, which were influenced by the free jazz stylings of contemporary artists such as Pharoah Sanders and Abdullah Ibrahim. Jackson wrote arrangements that tended to be more straight-ahead material, incorporating classic jazz bridges in his compositions. Scott-Heron, as the main lyricist and vocalist, exhibited more pop sensibilities with his compositions and created indelible hooks that were influenced by the black popular music of the time. By combining their distinct approaches to composing, Scott-Heron and Jackson produced a multicultural, diffused sound that evoked the afrobeat and world music style of artists such as Fela Kuti during the African music scene's popularity.
"Winter in America" conveys themes of nostalgic hope juxtaposed to the social problems present during the early 1970s, specifically in the black community and inner city. Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's faith in their culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in an environment that can pressure change. Other themes present on the album include love, fatherhood, freedom, alcoholism and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the "Winter" collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist and Scott-Heron associate Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's inner sleeve and in the liner booklet of "Winter in America"s CD reissue.
Songs.
Tracks 1-4.
The album's style and themes are exemplified by the bookending track "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the "In a Silent Way"-era jazz of Miles Davis. "Peace Go with You, Brother" has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, as well as people for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. 
"Rivers of My Fathers" is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, "Looking for a way out of this confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." The narrator beseeches the "river" to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers "Africa". "Rivers of My Fathers" has been cited by critics as one of the album's best recordings, and has earned comparison to the novel "Song of Solomon", as both works contain themes relating to the significance of ancestry and culture. 
The melancholy, nostalgic love song "A Very Precious Time" contains an uplifting timbre of Jackson's flute with joyful singing by Scott-Heron. While his lyrics depict a requiem to innocence and first love, the song's general message explores the concept of nostalgia as a means to remain in the present, despite the loss of hope or faith that can be brought on by the struggle of the present as opposed to the past. The tempo of the album is picked up by the opening vamp of "Back Home", which contains the concept of family and its positive values.
Tracks 5-9.
"The Bottle" is a commentary on alcohol abuse with a Caribbean beat and flute harmonies by Jackson. It became a popular song played at parties at the time. French music critic Pierre Jean-Critin calls it "an epic song [...] whose infectious groove can still set dance floors alight over thirty years later." The song's dance and popular music sensibilities and social message engendered its appeal to listeners following its release as a single. Scott-Heron later said of the single's success and style, "Pop music doesn't necessarily have to be shit." "The Bottle" also addresses problems of drug addiction, abortion, and incarceration, and features Scott-Heron on keyboards. Despite its grim observations, "The Bottle" became a concert favorite and one of Scott-Heron's most popular songs. It is followed by soulful, low-tempo tracks "Song for Bobby Smith" and "Your Daddy Loves You"; the latter is an introspective ballad and ode to Scott-Heron's daughter Gia Louise. 
During the October 15, 1973 session, drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens contributed to the tracks "Peace Go with You", "Rivers of My Fathers", "Back Home", and "The Bottle". Adams, however, was disappointed that "H²Ogate Blues" was to be left off the album. The song originally served as an opening monologue concerning the Watergate incident used by Scott-Heron at his concerts, and it contains proto-rap and talking blues elements, in which rhythmic speech or near-speech is accompanied by a free melody and strict rhythm. The studio version, which was recorded during the album's sessions, was not intended to be for the album prior to Adams' objection, as Scott-Heron said that "nobody outside of Washington seemed to know what the hell I was talking about." Scott-Heron later revisited the experience in the liner notes of the album's 1998 reissue. On Adams' opinion of "H²Ogate Blues", he wrote that "His reply was that even if people didn’t understand the politics it’s still funny as hell." On the recording, Scott-Heron stated:
The resulting track features sharp criticism by Scott-Heron of then-US president Richard Nixon and his vice-president Spiro Agnew, among other politicians involved in the scandal; the Watergate incident had yet to reach its conclusion when the song was recorded. Scott-Heron introduces the song with a short speech discussing the blues and referencing current events: "But lately we had Frank Rizzo with the 'Lie Detector Blues'/We done had the United States government talkin bout the 'Energy Crisis Blues'". The final chorus line directly references Nixon and the scandal: "And there are those who swear that've seen King Richard/Beneath that cesspool–Watergate". His lyrics range from humor to critical diatribes of political corruption and social issues. It shares lyrical similarities to Stevie Wonder's anti-Nixon song "You Haven't Done Nothin'" (1974). The album concludes with a reprisal of the opening track. Music writer Karl Keely said of its significance, "The return of the refrain from 'Peace Go with You Brother' adds a sense of wholeness to end the record, an idea that the album has travelled through Gil Scott-Heron's worries, fears, pleasures, hopes, and finally, his pronounced disliking of Richard Nixon, before returning to the opening statement, in the hopes that the record may have made that selfish brother think more about his world and those in it, instead of moving along in a self-imposed bubble."
Title track.
The title track, which was not featured on the original LP, was recorded after the album's release at the suggestion of Peggy Harris, the artist who designed the "Winter" collage for the inner sleeve of the LP. Initially, Scott-Heron and Jackson meant for "Winter in America" to lack a title track, which contrasted their previous label's trend of having their work include title tracks. The album title's purpose meant only to describe the general theme of "Winter in America"s songs. According to Scott-Heron, a title track "separates from the rest of the lyrics, better, or worse or different." 
The studio version of "Winter in America" was released on his following album, "The First Minute of a New Day" (1975), while a live version, recorded in 1982 at Washington, D.C.'s Black Wax Club, was included on the 1998 CD reissue of "Winter in America". The song features Scott-Heron's poetic references and lyrics that portray America in a dystopian state where "democracy is rag-time on the corner", "the forest is buried beneath the highway", "robins are perched in barren treetops", and, in conclusion, "no one is fighting because no one knows what to say."
Commercial performance.
Upon its original stereo LP release in May 1974, the album had a short supply and distribution due to the Strata-East label's independent distribution policy of their artists' releases. Consequently, "Winter in America" became considered by many fans to be the great "lost" Gil Scott-Heron album, before a proper reissue on compact disc thirty years following its original issue. The album served as the first of their collaborations to have Jackson receive co-billing for a release. Unlike Scott-Heron's previous albums, "Winter in America" experienced some commercial success with the help of promotional resources in the form of underground music deejays and club promoters, in spite of the album's limited distribution. While it did not chart on the U.S. "Billboard" Pop Albums chart, the album charted on the Top Jazz Albums chart and peaked at number six. "Winter in America" entered the Top Jazz Albums on June 29, 1974 and remained there for 40 weeks, until March 29, 1975. According to a 1990 "Los Angeles Times" article on Scott-Heron, the album ended up selling more than 300,000 copies.
"Winter in America"s only single release, "The Bottle", soon became an underground and cult hit following its issue. Despite its underground reputation, the song became one of Scott-Heron's most successful singles, as it reached the number 15 spot on the R&B Singles Chart. According to an article on Scott-Heron for a November 1974 issue of "Billboard", the success of the single "has made his most recent album, 'Winter in America', a national best-seller and heralds his wide-ranging appeal." The success of "The Bottle" also helped lead to Jackson's and Scott-Heron's following recording contract with Arista Records, which had been established in late 1974, the label at which they would enjoy further success and a larger amount of commercial notice. Upon signing them, Arista executive Clive Davis said of Scott-Heron in an interview with "Rolling Stone", "Not only is he an excellent poet, musician and performer—three qualities I look for that are rarely combined—but he's a leader of social thought." Along with approval from Arista executives, "Winter in America" was well received by the underground music scene, in which Scott-Heron earned the majority of his fan base, and added to Scott-Heron's reputation as a socially aware and conscious artist.
Critical reception.
"Winter in America" earned retrospective praise from music critics, who cite it as one of Scott-Heron's best albums. "Uncut" magazine's Barney Hoskyns praised the album, calling it an "introspective seasonal offering from black poet-singer and collaborating pianist". He also lauded its critical content and called it "a masterwork of ghetto melancholia and stark political gravitas". Ron Wynn of Allmusic wrote of Scott-Heron's performance, in that he was "at his most righteous and provocative on this album", while acknowledging Jackson's contributions as well. BBC Online's Daryl Easlea called the album "an affecting work" and wrote that its title track "should be played as standard on all modern history courses as a snapshot of the stilted hopes and aspirations in the post Watergate and Vietnam War mid 70s America". "The Washington Post"s Richard Harrington cited "The Bottle" and "H²Ogate Blues" as "classic Scott-Heron works" in a review of its reissue. "Los Angeles Times" writer Mike Boehm viewed that its title track "sounded a sad death-knell for '60s hopes of transforming change", while calling it a "wonderful mood piece, capturing what it's like to feel oppressed in your soul by outer-world events that seem out of control". Danny Eccleston of "Mojo" called it an "alloy of Rhodes-laden souljazz with razor-sharp beat-poetry" and quipped, "Anger, radicalism, humour and funk from the proto-rapper, thankfully restored to health and liberty."
"Dream" magazine columnist Kevin Moist stated that the album "further jazzified his mixture of street poetry, soulful spirit, political commitment, and Black cultural expression." He also noted the history of the Strata-East label, and summed up "Winter in America"s significance, stating "Radically charged but musically mostly stark and low-key, melodic and soulful as hell, sometimes full band flow while at others just voice and piano, all hanging tight under a melancholy cloud of belatedness [...] Thematically, the album reaches back even further than its predecessors in drawing on Black cultural energy as a source of power for facing down the coming political/cultural Ice Age in America. But Scott-Heron was never a one-dimensional ranter, and his pen is as double-edged here as it ever was, slicing into the growing self-destructiveness and sell-out/buy-in tendencies that were fragmenting the Black community, as incisively as it stabs at the jowls of evil in the White House. As badass as it is understated, and really hasn’t dated just a little bit." "The Observer" called the album a "jazz fusion pillar stone, with a social conscience to boot". Music writer Karl Keely praised Scott-Heron's vocal maturity from his previous work, and noted Jackson's influence for improving and expanding the music's melodic content. Keely commented that it demonstrates "the evolution of Scott-Heron from politicised poet to soulful singer". Music historian Piero Scaruffi dubbed the album Scott-Heron's "first musical statement."
However, "Houston Press" writer Paul J. MacArthur expressed a mixed response towards its production quality and called "Winter in America" the "most dated" of the Scott-Heron reissues. In his 1974 consumer guide for "The Village Voice", Robert Christgau gave the album a C+ rating, indicating "a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork", and quipped of Scott-Heron's decision to sing jazz rather than orate it, "he had a better beat and just slightly less melody when he was reading." In a 1975 article for "The Village Voice", he commended the album's title track as "an evocation of our despondency that is as flawless as it is ambitious".
Legacy and influence.
"Winter in America" has been recognized by music writers as one of the prominent examples of early rap, along with the early work of The Watts Prophets and The Last Poets. "The Bottle" was covered by latin soul musician Joe Bataan for his album "Afrofilipino" (1975). Recordings featured on the album, along with other Scott-Heron/Jackson compositions, were sampled by hip hop artists, including "The Bottle" on the Jungle Brothers' "Black Is Black". This further expanded Scott-Heron's legacy as one of the progenitors of hip hop. The diverse sound and mellow instrumentation featured on the album, referred to by Scott-Heron as "bluesology", later inspired neo soul artists in the 1990s and helped solidify Scott-Heron's and Jackson's legacy in the genre. On Jackson's legacy, "All About Jazz" described him as "one of the early architects of the neo-soul", while citing his early work with Scott-Heron as "an inspirational and musical Rosetta stone for the neo-soul movement". Pierre Jean-Critin of the French music magazine "Vibrations" wrote of Scott-Heron and the album, stating "As an artist who conceives his albums as newspapers and similar testimonies, Gil Scott-Heron is one of America's finest observers and commentators of social reality as well as being one of the most creative and influential figures in African-American music, and this landmark album announced his arrival." 
The album also marked the transition of Scott-Heron from beat poet to singer-songwriter with a full-scale band. He further developed this melodic approach with his following work with Brian Jackson, "The First Minute of a New Day" (1975) and "From South Africa to South Carolina" (1976). While the album did not have a direct impact on the black music scene at the time, it proved to become one of the Strata-East label's most successful LP releases, in terms of sales and appeal to their target audience. While serving as Scott-Heron's and Jackson's only album for the independent label, "Winter in America" helped Strata-East Records achieve considerable notability among other New York City distributors of soul and jazz music during the 1970s, while the latter genre had been viewed by many jazz purists to be in a period of creative confusion and decline. In describing the label and its issued musical works, "Dream" magazine's Kevin Moist stated "The diversity and experimentation of the music, plus the great quality of many of those experiments, make it seem like more like a creative golden age in which the dominant idea was new ideas mixing and blending cultural styles and artistic genres or pushing existing styles into new extremes." According to Nick Dedina of Rhapsody, "Winter in America" had impact elsewhere, stating "this deeply felt (and sometimes deeply funky) album helped break the pioneer of protest jazz-soul and rap to the general public with hit single 'The Bottle'".
The album was re-released with previously unreleased bonus material by Scott-Heron's Rumal-Gia label in 1998, following a reissue project headed by Scott-Heron after he had received ownership of his 1970s recordings. The record's significance and influence in music has led to much retrospective favor of it among music writers and critics, as shown in "Winter"s rankings in several "best of" publication polls. "Winter in America" was ranked number 67 on "New Nation"s June 2004 list of The Top 100 Black Albums. The album was also listed in the music reference book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" (2006). "The Bottle" was later ranked number 92 on "NME" magazine's list of The Top 150 Singles of All-Time and was included in "Q" magazine's 1010 Songs You Must Own! publication. The title track was included on music writer Bruce Pollock's 2005 list of The 7,500 Most Important Songs of 1944-2000, and it was ranked number 82 on "Blow Up"s list of 100 Songs to Remember.

Release history.
"Winter in America" was originally released as a 12" vinyl record, in stereo format only. Released in May 1974 with a limited supply, the record remained out of print for nearly twenty five years in the United States until 1998, when Scott-Heron acquired ownership of his recordings, with the exception of his material for the Flying Dutchman label. Afterwards, he initiated a reissue project through his own Rumal-Gia label, which had obtained a distribution deal with TVT Records. The compact disc reissue contains bonus tracks, including the live version of the title track, and the original and new liner notes written by Gil Scott-Heron. Prior to this, a German release of "Winter in America" was issued in 1992 as was a remastered LP in 1996. However, they did not include these features. Other remasters were also released in Europe, as listed below.

Alcée Fortier

Alcée Fortier (June 5, 1856–1914) was a renowned Professor of Romance Languages at Tulane University in New Orleans. In the late 19th and early 20th century, he published numerous works on language, literature, Louisiana history and folklore, Louisiana Creole languages, and personal reminiscence. His perspective was valuable because of his French Creole ancestry. He was president of the Modern Language Association and Louisiana Historical Society, was appointed to the State Board of Education, and was active in the American Folklore Society and the New Orleans Academy of Sciences.
Early life and education.
Fortier was born in St. James Parish, the son of Florent Louis Fortier and Edwige Aime. His father and grandfathers were sugar cane planters of French Creole ancestry. The Fortier family had been in the Louisiana territory since the early 17th century. His maternal grandfather was Valcour Aime, who also had a sugar cane plantation in St. James Parish. The families were prominent in the social and political life of the parish and the state.
Fortier's life was marked by the interruption of the American Civil War, and his family's abrupt changes in fortune following the war. He completed classes at the classical school of A.V. Romain in New Orleans and entered the University of Virginia. Serious illness prevented him from completing his studies there. Fortier returned to New Orleans and read law, then started working as a clerk.
Career.
Fortier taught French in the city high school, then became principal in the preparatory department of the University of Louisiana.
In 1880 Fortier was elected professor of French in the University of Louisiana, and was reelected when it became Tulane University. He worked as a Professor of Romance Languages there his entire career, but expanded his studies to include Louisiana Creole, Acadian French, and Louisiana folklore of both Acadians and freedmen, as well as European languages.
Fortier was a prolific author, publishing a range of studies on the French literature of Louisiana and France; dialect studies of Louisiana Creoles, Acadians and Isleños; Creole folk tales in translation; and in 1903 a four-volume history of Louisiana that was well reviewed by the "New York Times".
He was also active in a range of new local, state, and national professional organizations. He was president of the Modern Language Association (founded 1883) and Louisiana Historical Society (1835), was appointed to the State Board of Education, and was active in the American Folklore Society (founded 1888) and the New Orleans Academy of Sciences (1859).
Marriage and family.
On October 22, 1881, Fortier married Marie Lanauze. They had eight children.

Legacy and honors.
Fortier was significant in the study of French language and literature in Louisiana and the United States, as well as the study of Louisiana Creole dialects - he did work in Louisiana Creole, Cajun and Isleño forms. By publishing folk tales in Louisiana Creole and English, he honored the origin of the stories in African heritage, as well as making the stories more accessible to larger audiences.
His name is remembered in New Orleans:

2008 ISSF World Cup Final (shotgun)

The 2008 ISSF World Cup Final in shotgun events was held on 27–30 September in Minsk, Belarus. It was the last major worldwide shotgun competition in 2008, and the next-to-last part of the 2008 ISSF World Cup, to be concluded with the rifle and pistol finals in Bangkok a month later.
There were twelve spots in each of the five events. The defending champion from the 2007 World Cup Final and all medalists of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing qualified automatically for Minsk. The remaining eight qualified through a special point-awarding system based on their best performance during the World Cup season, skipping past automatic qualifiers. Not counting the defending champion and the Olympic medalists, there was a maximum of two shooters per event from the same country. Belarus, being the host country, also were allowed to participate with one shooter.
The qualification system awarded a win with 15 points, a silver medal with 10, a bronze medal with 8, a fourth place with 5, a fifth with 4, a sixth with 3, a seventh with 2 and an eighth place with 1 point. It also gave out points for qualification scores within a certain range from the current world record: from 1 point for fourteen hits off the record, to 15 points for equalling or raising it.

Joe Salmon

Joe Salmon (born 1931 in Galway, Ireland) is a former Irish sportsperson. He played hurling at various times with his local clubs Liam Mellows in Galway and Glen Rovers in Cork. Salmon also played with the Galway senior inter-county team from 1949 until 1964. He is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland medal.
Playing career.
Club.
Salmon played his club hurling with his local Meelick Eyrecourt club and enjoyed some success. He also played with the famous Glen Rovers club in Cork. In all Salmon collected five county championship medals.
Inter-county.
Salmon first came to prominence with the Galway minor inter-county team in the 1940s. He lined out in the All-Ireland final of 1947, however, Tipperary were the victors on that occasion.
Salmon later joined the Galway senior team, however, Galway hurling was in the doldrums at the time. The fact that the county faced no competition in Connacht meant that the team went straight into the All-Ireland series every single year. This was not a happy hunting ground for the county.
Salmon first tasted success with Galway in 1951. That year his side reached the finals of the National Hurling League. Galway defeated Wexford and New York giving Salmon a coveted National League medal.
Two years later in 1953 Galway defeated a star-studded Kilkenny team in the penultimate stage of the championship. This victory allowed Salmon's side to advance to the All-Ireland final where Cork provided the opposition. The game itself is remembered as one of the ugliest championship deciders ever and is clouded in controversy due to the injury to the Galway captain, Mick Burke. Galway lost the game by 3-3 to 0-8. After the match at the Gresham Hotel in Dublin a fight broke out when another Galway player struck Cork's Christy Ring. The following morning another fight broke out when another member of the Galway panel attempted to hit Ring. The fights, however, ended just as quickly as they had started.
Five years later in 1958 Galway were given a bye into the All-Ireland final in an effort to improve the standard of hurling in the county. Tipperray provided the opposition on that occasion.Liam Devaney, Donie Nealon and Larry Keane all scored goals for Tipp in the first-half, while Tony Wall sent a 70-yard free untouched to the Galway net. Tipp won the game by 4-9 to 2-5.
This defeat saw Galway enter the Munster Championship in 1959. It was not a happy hunting ground for the county. Salmon retired from inter-county hurling in 1964.
Provincial.
Salmon also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial hurling competition, however, he never won a Railway Cup medal.

John Shannon (musician)

John Shannon is an American folk and jazz guitarist and composer.
Early life and education.
Shannon grew up in Pittsburgh. His adolescence was spent steeping in Pittsburgh’s underground music scene, where indie-rock house shows and jazz gigs influenced him as much as an American Indian survival school. He is a graduate of the Berklee College of Music and currently resides in New York City.
Style.
AllMusic has compared his style of folk/singer-songwriter music to both Tim Buckley and Nick Drake, stating, "his complex folk- and jazz-flavored melodies and lyrical acoustic guitar style, as well as his breathy vocal delivery, certainly sound heavily influenced by one or both."
Works.
Solo.
John Shannon set his musical roots at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA with a project by the name of Waking Vision Trio. Shannon's first solo album, "American Mystic", was released on April 29, 2008 on ObliqSound. AllMusic described the "minimalist voice and guitar" album as "primarily a mood piece, the sort of album one plays in close proximity to a warm bath and/or a pot of herbal tea, while letting Shannon's whispery voice and gently flowing guitar wash over unencumbered." Fred Kraus of Minor 7th praised the album for it's minimalist yet hypnotic sound, stating, "It's as if he's holding a stethoscope to the ground, channeling what he hears through eons of nature's voices, running it all through his heart, and then out through his fingers."
"Songs of the Desert River", Shannon's second album for the Creek Valley imprint of ObliqSound, was released on June 14, 2011. The album was recorded in Paris and New York, and was backed by the band Wings of Sound, which features Dan Brantigan on flugelhorn, Garth Stevenson on acoustic bass, Ziv Ravitz on drums, and Caroline McMahon on backing vocals. In his AllMusic review, Thom Jurek praised the way Wings of Sound subtly complimented Shannon, stating, "it is deceptively simple in its articulation of the profound, yet remains utterly mysterious; its abundant beauty resonates long after its final song echoes, then vanishes into the realm of silence"
Shannon's most recent album, "Time Was a Lie", was released on October 30, 2012 on Creek Valley Records. Like "Songs of the Desert River", the album was recorded in Paris and New York, and is Shannon's first album to include electric bass. The album features Evan Pazner on drums, Caroline McMahon on backing vocals and Tony Grey on electric bass. Regarding the album, David Kleiner of Minor 7th references how Shannon uses repetition in both sound and key lyrics to create a hypnotic effect, stating, "The songs' rhythms tend to stay constant while drawing in the listener, whether Shannon is picking the acoustic to create a tumbling waterfall repetition in tunes like 'Burning Embers' or strumming an unchanging rhythm as in 'City Lights.'" The album also features a cover of Paul Simon's "Graceland."
Sideman work.
Shannon is also known for his work as a sideman guitarist with artists such as pianist Hiromi Uehara, singer/songwriter James Maddock, saxophonist Bob Reynolds, singer/songwriter Sonya Kitchell and cellist/trombonist Dana Leong.

List of Ghostbusters video games

This is a list of video games that are a part of the Ghostbusters media franchise. The games have been released on many consoles since 1984. Due to the success of the movie, there have been a number of sequels since.
"Ghostbusters" (Activision).
"Ghostbusters" is a licensed game produced by Activision based on the movie of the same name. It was designed by David Crane, produced by Brad Fregger, and released for several home computer platforms in 1984, and later released for various video game console systems, including the Atari 2600, Sega Master System and NES.
Most versions of the game had a similar basic format to the initial Commodore 64 and Atari 800 game, which Crane wrote in six weeks. He based it in part on an incomplete game called "Car Wars" featuring armed automobiles in a city; this led, for example, to the "ghost vacuum" on the Ecto-1, something not present in the film. Activision obtained the license early in the film's production, and most of the game was finished by the time Crane watched the film. While pleased with the game, Crane later stated that he regretted not being able to include a better victory screen. The last week of development was spent on the opening screen which plays the Ghostbusters theme. The game was later ported to the Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MSX.
The game starts with a choice between four drivable cars, and the player must stock up on equipment and make money to complete their objectives. Upon completion of the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari 8-bit, Amstrad CPC and MSX versions of the game, a code was provided that allowed the player to start a new game with the amount of money accumulated by the end of the previous game. This allowed accelerated progression in the new game. The game varied in some respects depending upon which platform it was played; the Sega Master System version (1987) added an on-foot shooting gallery level with different animations, while the NES version (1988), ported by Japanese developer Micronics, made the action sequences considerably more difficult, had lower graphical resolution and provided a different ending. The new ending in the NES version was full of spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes:
This ending text can also be seen on a monitor in the Firehouse in "".
"Edge" magazine called "Ghostbusters" "dauntingly good", noting that despite the action sequences expected of a licensed title, the game was a "polished, intelligently-paced", strategic business simulation. Ernie Hudson said, "My kids really hated Commodore 64 game. They thought it sucked."
The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of the game was included on the 1986 compilation "They Sold a Million 3", along with Fighter Pilot, Rambo and Kung-Fu Master. The game was also released on "The Story So Far Volume IV" in December 1989, and "Hollywood Collection" in December 1990. It knocked "Daley Thompson's Decathlon" from the top of the UK Spectrum sales chart.
The NES version was created in association with Works (later changed their name to Bits Laboratory). An enhanced remake of the Spectrum version was released as freeware for the PC in 2006.
"The Real Ghostbusters" arcade game.
"The Real Ghostbusters" was an arcade game based on the cartoon series of the same name released by a Japanese game company, Data East in 1987. The game was later ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. Up to three players can control members of the Ghostbusters. The characters are only differentiated by the colors of their uniforms, no effort is made to identify them, although the game's cabinet art shows the characters from the cartoon. The game has a total of 10 levels. In Japan the game is known as Meikyuu Hunter G, but bears little resemblance to the western version as it did not use the Ghostbusters license. It supports only up to two players, makes no mention of the Ghostbusters, equips the players with different weapons, many of the monsters are different and has completely different level designs from the western version.
The Ghostbusters fight off hordes of nightmarish creatures with energy guns which reduce the monsters to harmless ghosts which can then be captured with beams from their proton packs. Power-ups available included stronger basic shots, a force field that makes the Ghostbuster invincible for several seconds, and an item that summons Slimer to throw himself in the way of attacks.
"Ghostbusters II" video game.
"Ghostbusters II" is the title of a video game released for several home computer and console systems. The game is loosely based on the film of the same name.
Computer versions.
All home computer editions were published by Activision. Each home computer game edition of the game is essentially similar, with changes in the quality of graphics and sound. The DOS version is completely different from the other ones, having been developed by a different company, Dynamix with game design by Doug Barnett.
Most version of the game feature several arcade sequences based on the film: Van Horne: the player controls Ray Stantz as he is lowered into an air shaft of the disused Van Horne subway system to collect a sample of slime. He is armed with his proton pack and other weaponry with which to defend himself against the myriad of ghosts that attack: some will collide or grab him and cause damage, while others will attempt to cut his rope. The player must collect the three segments of the slime scoop, as well as ammo and health, during the descent. Journey to the Museum: the Statue of Liberty has been brought to life by "mood slime" and is marching toward the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the player controls a floating fireball (generated from the Statue's torch) which fires horizontal shots and must be used to protect the Statue from swarms of ghosts. Impacts from ghosts (or regeneration of the fireball) uses up precious slime, though it can be replenished from destroyed ghosts. Showdown in the Museum: the player controls the four Ghostbusters individually, armed variously with proton packs and slime dispensers, in an isometric 3D level. The four heroes must rappel into the Museum and fight Janosz, Vigo the Carpathian, and finally a possessed Ray, in order to save the world. Some versions also feature a sequence based on the courtroom fight against the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers.
The DOS version of the game is entirely different. It begins with the Ghostbusters battling the Scoleri Brothers in the courtroom scene from the film. At the firehouse, players can choose to capture ghosts in variation locations from the film for money or gather samples from the river of slime and test it to develop the positively charged slime. If a Ghostbuster fails to capture a ghost or falls into the river of slime, he is captured and must be rescued from Parkview Hospital.
Once you have earned $55,000 from capturing ghosts, and collected and correctly tested 3 slime samples, you can then take control of the Statue of Liberty, where you have to navigate through the streets of New York until you reach the Museum; a map, that comes with the game, is required to find the correct route, plus you have to avoid crushing cars and beating the clock as you maneuver the statue.
Once you reach the museum, you break in from the roof. Inside, you'll find Vigo who is strutting about out of his painting. he wont attack, but you can zap him to weaken him for the upcoming battles. Once the clock reaches midnight, Vigo returns to his painting and attacks with rapid fireballs, where one hit will kill a ghostbuster. Janosz will also run about the room; shooting him, or the painting while he is in front of it will reflect your proton beam back at you and kill your Ghostbuster instantly. Once Vigo has been weakened enough, Janosz will collapse and Vigo will emerge from the painting as a giant head and fire rapid fire balls again. Your proton pack will turn into a slime blower, and you must hose him down until he is defeated; when he is close to death, he will be covered in pink slime. Upon defeat, Vigo will be defeated, and the painting will change to one of a smiling Slimer holding a baby in the clouds.
The victory scene shows all four Ghostbusters emerging from the Museum, waving and dancing for the cheering crowd awaiting outside.
"Computer Gaming World" praised the Statue of Liberty sequence, and called the graphics "nice", but overall gave "Ghostbusters II" a mixed review because of its combination of brief story length and lengthy replays needed to master the game.
Activision NES version.
Activision's NES edition of the game is a single-player side-scrolling game where the player controls a Ghostbuster through various stages based on the film, making their way to the museum before time runs out. Two levels involves riding around in the heroes' famous car and another level requires the player to control the Statue of Liberty, shooting fireballs. The game was noted for being exceptionally hard to complete.
"New Ghostbusters II".
There was also a version of the game released in Europe and Japan for the NES and Game Boy, entitled New Ghostbusters II, developed by HAL Laboratory. It is more of a straightforward action game than the Activision game. The Game Boy version was released in America without the "New" label.
Atari 2600 version.
Activision also made a version of the game for the Atari 2600 in 1989. Activision never released the game, perhaps due to the system's age and slowing sales. British game company Salu released the game in Europe under their name in 1992, after Atari had already ended support for the system. Licensing issues have prevented this version of the game from being included on the "Activision Anthology" collections, along with a handful of other titles.
"Ghostbusters" Mega Drive/Genesis video game.
"Ghostbusters" was published by Sega and developed by Compile for the Mega Drive/Genesis on June 29, 1990. It is unrelated to the earlier Activision game (though their name still appears in the copyright screen), and is instead a run and gun game in which the player takes control of squat cartoon representations of three of the four Ghostbusters from the movie, with the noticeable absence of Winston Zeddemore.
Four levels are available initially; after they are completed, a fifth level is unlocked, followed by a sixth and final level. Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as "middle ghosts"; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items.
The Ghostbusters are down on their luck due to lack of ghost activity, when suddenly several calls begin to pour in from around the city, including the eventual reappearance of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (although dialogue indicates it is not the same one from the movie). After each case, a piece of a stone tablet is collected. The three Ghostbusters piece together the mysterious tablet, inadvertently opening a portal to "the evil world" and releasing a horde of ghosts. In the end, though, the Ghostbusters manage to defeat Janna, the God of Darkness, and retrieve a mystical gem from the evil world. They combine the gem with the tablet to close the portal, and save the city.
"The Real Ghostbusters" 1993 Game Boy video game.
The 1993 "The Real Ghostbusters" game was developed by Kemco and published in North America by Activision for the Game Boy. In it, the player played as Peter Venkman. The game is based on Kemco's "Crazy Castle" franchise and features similar puzzle-oriented gameplay. This game was released in Europe as "Garfield Labyrinth" and in Japan as , which features different characters and licenses for both versions.
"Extreme Ghostbusters" games.
"Extreme Ghostbusters".
"Extreme Ghostbusters" was released on April 2, 2001 by Light and Shadow Productions for the Game Boy Color.
It was originally thought to be intended for multiple consoles and the personal computer. It includes four playable characters including Kylie, Garett, Roland, and Eduardo. Each character has unique gameplay attributes and may be chosen at any point in the game. Set in New York City, players must defeat and either capture or destroy ghosts.
"Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1".
Light & Shadow Production released a Game Boy Advance version of "Extreme Ghostbusters" in March 2002. The half-human/half-demon Count Mercharior has kidnapped Roland and Garett, two key members of the Ghostbusters team. The remaining team members, Eduardo and Kylie, immediately set off to find them, determined to capture the ghosts who have come to invade the city. The game was a combination platform and shooter game with some races, using a top-down perspective. There were 12 platform levels and four regions.
"Extreme Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Invasion".
A video game made in 2004 by LSP, the game was similar to "Time Crisis". Players would choose from one of the four Extreme Ghostbusters and play through various missions set in New York. It can be used with gun con. There are two kinds of shots that can be fired, using a proton cartridge like what is seen in the show. There is a standard mini proton shot, similar to a bullet fire, that uses 1/10 of cartridge, or a proton beam, which uses 5/10 a proton cartridge. There are 3 game modes; Adventure, Training, and Replay.
"Ghostbusters" 2006 mobile game.
A top down puzzle game was released in 2006 for cell phones on Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Cingular (now AT&T) networks. The story revolves around the Ghostbusters being hired by a millionaire tycoon to rid his home of ghosts, but the story does not go beyond that with no cut scenes or dialog during the game. Ultimately, "Ghostbusters" mobile was panned critically due to its extreme length (over 100 rooms to enter), plain gameplay design (gathering colored keys, pushing statues, activating switches), and no real references to any of the original Ghostbusters characters or movies, besides the opening theme music.
"Ghostbusters: The Video Game" (2009).
"Ghostbusters: The Video Game " is a video game for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and PC. The game was originally slated for an October 2008 release. ZootFly began independently developing the game in May 2006 but hit a "bump in the road" with regard to the "Ghostbusters" copyright in July 2006.Vivendi Universal acquired the rights to make the game, which was developed by Terminal Reality for the PlayStation 3, PC and Xbox 360, and by Red Fly Studios for the Wii, DS and PS2. Harold Ramis has said that he and Aykroyd, in addition to contributing to the game's script, did voiceover for the "Ghostbusters" video game. It was released on June 16, 2009 for the U.S, June 19, 2009 for EU on the PlayStation formats (due to a publishing deal by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe), and November 2009 for other formats in the EU, though the US Xbox 360 version of the game is region free, it can be played on any Xbox 360 console.
"Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime" (2011).
"Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime" is a video game for download for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC. It is a sequel to "Ghostbusters: The Video Game".
"Ghostbusters: Paranormal Blast" (2012).
Ghostbusters: Paranormal Blast is a located-based Augmented Reality mobile game launched by XMG Studio in August 2012 available for sale in the iTunes App Store. The exclusive prototype of Ghostbusters: Paranormal Blast was previewed at PAX East 2012. The game was also promoted at Comic-Con 2012. The game allows users to take the perspective of a Ghostbuster, catching ghosts in their own cities.

John Milton Platt

"For other people named John Platt, see John Platt."
John Milton Platt (April 18, 1840 – September 27, 1919) was a physician and political figure in Ontario, Canada. He represented Prince Edward in the Canadian House of Commons from 1882 to 1891 as a Liberal member.
He was born in Athol Township, Upper Canada, the son of Dyer Platt and Myria Morgan. Platt was educated at the Fort Edward Institute in New York state and at Victoria University in Cobourg. In 1872, Platt married Amelia Brnnscombe. He also served as a public school inspector and as surgeon for the militia. Platt was editor and publisher for the Picton "New Nation". His election in 1888 was overturned after an appeal but he won the by-election that followed. He was defeated by Archibald Campbell Miller when he ran for reelection in 1891. Platt later served as warden for Kingston Penitentiary from 1899 to 1913. He died in Picton at the age of 79.

Kepler orbit

In celestial mechanics, a Kepler orbit (or Keplerian orbit) describes the motion of an orbiting body as an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola, which forms a two-dimensional orbital plane in three-dimensional space. (A Kepler orbit can also form a straight line.) It considers only the point-like gravitational attraction of two bodies, neglecting perturbations due to gravitational interactions with other objects, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, a non-spherical central body, and so on. It is thus said to be a solution of a special case of the two-body problem, known as the Kepler problem. As a theory in classical mechanics, it also does not take into account the effects of general relativity. Keplerian orbits can be parametrized into six orbital elements in various ways.
In most applications, there is a large central body, the center of mass of which is assumed to be the center of mass of the entire system. By decomposition, the orbits of two objects of similar mass can be described as Kepler orbits around their common center of mass, their barycenter.
Introduction.
From ancient times until the 16th and 17th centuries, the motions of the planets were believed to follow perfectly circular geocentric paths as taught by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Ptolemy. Variations in the motions of the planets were explained by smaller circular paths overlaid on the larger path (see epicycle). As measurements of the planets became increasingly accurate, revisions to the theory were proposed. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a heliocentric model of the solar system, although he still believed that the planets traveled in perfectly circular paths centered on the sun.
Johannes Kepler.
In 1601, Johannes Kepler acquired the extensive, meticulous observations of the planets made by Tycho Brahe. Kepler would spend the next five years trying to fit the observations of the planet Mars to various curves. In 1609, Kepler published the first two of his three laws of planetary motion. The first law states:
More generally, the path of an object undergoing Keplerian motion may also follow a parabola or a hyperbola, which, along with ellipses, belong to a group of curves known as conic sections. Mathematically, the distance between a central body and an orbiting body can be expressed as:
where:
Alternately, the equation can be expressed as:
Where formula_7 is called the semi-latus rectum of the curve. This form of the equation is particularly useful when dealing with parabolic trajectories, for which the semi-major axis is infinite.
Despite developing these laws from observations, Kepler was never able to develop a theory to explain these motions.
Isaac Newton.
Between 1665 to 1666, Isaac Newton developed several concepts related to motion, gravitation and differential calculus. However, these concepts were not published until 1687 in the Principia, in which he outlined his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. His second of his three laws of motion states:
The acceleration a of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the net force acting on the body, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body:
Where:
Strictly speaking, this form of the equation only applies to an object of constant mass, which holds true based on the simplifying assumptions made below.
Newton's law of gravitation states:
Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses:
where:
From the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, Newton was able to derive Kepler's laws, demonstrating consistency between observation and theory. The laws of Kepler and Newton formed the basis of modern celestial mechanics until Albert Einstein introduced the concepts of special and general relativity in the early 20th century. For most applications, Keplerian motion approximates the motions of planets and satellites to relatively high degrees of accuracy and is used extensively in astronomy and astrodynamics.
Simplified two body problem.
To solve for the motion of an object in a two body system, two simplifying assumptions can be made:
The shapes of large celestial bodies are close to spheres. By symmetry, the net gravitational force attracting a mass point towards a homogeneous sphere must be directed towards its centre. The shell theorem (also proven by Isaac Newton) states that the magnitude of this force is the same as if all mass was concentrated in the middle of the sphere, even if the density of the sphere varies with depth (as it does for most celestial bodies). From this immediately follows that the attraction between two homogeneous spheres is as if both had its mass concentrated to its center.
Smaller objects, like asteroids or spacecraft often have a shape strongly deviating from a sphere. But the gravitational forces produced by these irregularities are generally small compared to the gravity of the central body. The difference between an irregular shape and a perfect sphere also diminishes with distances, and most orbital distances are very large when compared with the diameter of a small orbiting body. Thus for some applications, shape irregularity can be neglected without significant impact on accuracy.
Planets rotate at varying rates and thus may take a slightly oblate shape because of the centrifugal force. With such an oblate shape, the gravitational attraction will deviate somewhat from that of a homogeneous sphere. This phenomenon is quite noticeable for artificial Earth satellites, especially those in low orbits. At larger distances the effect of this oblateness becomes negligible. Planetary motions in the Solar System can be computed with sufficient precision if they are treated as point masses.
Two point mass objects with masses formula_16 and formula_17 and position vectors formula_21 and formula_22 relative to some inertial reference frame experience gravitational forces:
where formula_12 is the relative position vector of mass 1 with respect to mass 2, expressed as:
and formula_27 is the unit vector in that direction and formula_2 is the length of that vector.
Dividing by their respective masses and subtracting the second equation from the first yields the equation of motion for the acceleration of the first object with respect to the second:
where formula_29 is the gravitational parameter and is equal to
In many applications, a third simplifying assumption can be made:
This assumption is not necessary to solve the simplified two body problem, but it simplifies calculations, particularly with Earth-orbiting satellites and planets orbiting the sun. Even Jupiter's mass is less than the sun's by a factor of 1047, which would constitute an error of 0.096% in the value of μ. Notable exceptions include the Earth-moon system (mass ratio of 81.3), the Pluto-Charon system (mass ratio of 8.9) and binary star systems.
Under these assumptions the differential equation for the two body case can be completely solved mathematically and the resulting orbit which follows Kepler's laws of planetary motion is called a "Kepler orbit". The orbits of all planets are to high accuracy Kepler orbits around the Sun. The small deviations are due to the much weaker gravitational attractions between the planets, and in the case of Mercury, due to general relativity. The orbits of the artificial satellites around the Earth are, with a fair approximation, Kepler orbits with small perturbations due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, the moon and the oblateness of the Earth. In high accuracy applications for which the equation of motion must be integrated numerically with all gravitational and non-gravitational forces (such as solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag) being taken into account, the Kepler orbit concepts are of paramount importance and heavily used.
Keplerian elements.
It is worth mentioning that any Keplerian trajectory can be defined by six parameters. The motion of an object moving in three-dimensional space is characterized by a position vector and a velocity vector. Each vector has three components, so the total number of values needed to define a trajectory through space is six. An orbit is generally defined by six elements (known as "Keplerian elements") that can be computed from position and velocity, three of which have already been discussed. These elements are convenient in that of the six, five are unchanging for an unperturbed orbit (a stark contrast to two constantly changing vectors). The future location of an object within its orbit can be predicted and its new position and velocity can be easily obtained from the orbital elements.
Two define the size and shape of the trajectory:
Three define the orientation of the orbital plane:
And finally:
Because formula_39, formula_40 and formula_41 are simply angular measurements defining the orientation of the trajectory in the reference frame, they are not strictly necessary when discussing the motion of the object within the orbital plane. They have been mentioned here for completeness, but are not required for the proofs below.
Mathematical solution of the differential equation () above.
For movement under any central force, i.e. a force parallel to r, the specific relative angular momentum formula_42 stays constant:
formula_43
Since the cross product of the position vector and its velocity stays constant, they must lie in the same plane, orthogonal to formula_44. This implies the vector function is a plane curve. 
Because the equation has symmetry around its origin, it is easier to solve in polar coordinates. However, it is important to note that equation () refers to linear acceleration formula_45, as opposed to angular formula_46 or radial formula_47 acceleration. Therefore, one must be cautious when transforming the equation.
Introducing a cartesian coordinate system formula_48 and polar unit vectors formula_49 in the plane orthogonal to formula_44:
formula_51
formula_52
We can now rewrite the vector function formula_53 and its derivatives as:
formula_54
formula_55
formula_56
(see "Polar coordinates#Vector calculus"). Substituting these into (), we find:
formula_57
This gives the non-ordinary polar differential equation:
In order to solve this equation, we must first eliminate all time derivatives. We find that:
formula_58
Taking the time derivative of (), we get
Equations () and () allow us to eliminate the time derivatives of formula_59. In order to eliminate the time derivatives of formula_2, we must use the chain rule to find appropriate substitutions:
Using these four substitutions, all time derivatives in () can be eliminated, yielding an ordinary differential equation for formula_2 as function of formula_62.
formula_63
formula_64
formula_65
The differential equation () can be solved analytically by the variable substitution
Using the chain rule for differentiation one gets:
Using the expressions () and () for formula_66 and formula_67
one gets
with the general solution
where "e" and formula_68 are constants of integration depending on the initial values for "s" and formula_69.
Instead of using the constant of integration formula_68 explicitly one introduces the convention that the unit vectors formula_71 defining the coordinate system in the orbital plane are selected such that formula_72 takes the value zero and "e" is positive. This then means that formula_62 is zero at the point where formula_74 is maximal and therefore formula_75 is minimal. Defining the parameter p as formula_76 one has that
formula_77
Alternate derivation.
Another way to solve this equation without the use of polar differential equations is as follows:Define a unit vector formula_78 such that formula_79 and formula_80. It follows that
formula_81
Now consider
formula_82
(see Triple product#Vector triple product). Notice that
formula_83
formula_84
Substituting these values into the previous equation, one gets:
formula_85
Integrating both sides:
formula_86
Where c is a constant vector. Dotting this with r yields an interesting result:
formula_87
Where formula_59 is the angle between formula_89 and formula_90. Solving for r: 
formula_91 for which the distance to the focus takes the minimal value formula_92, the pericentre. For the ellipse there is also an apocentre for which the distance to the focus takes the maximal value formula_93. For the hyperbola the range for formula_62 is
and for a parobola the range is
Using the chain rule for differentiation (), the equation () and the definition of "p" as formula_97 one gets that the radial velocity component is
and that the tangential component (velocity component perpendicular to formula_98) is
The connection between the polar argument formula_62 and time "t" is slightly different for elliptic and hyperbolic orbits.
For an elliptic orbit one switches to the "eccentric anomaly" "E" for which
and consequently
and the angular momentum "H" is
Integrating with respect to time "t" one gets
under the assumption that time formula_100 is selected such that the integration constant is zero.
As by definition of "p" one has
this can be written
For a hyperbolic orbit one uses the hyperbolic functions for the parameterisation
for which one has
and the angular momentum "H" is
Integrating with respect to time "t" one gets
i.e.
To find what time t that corresponds to a certain true anomaly formula_62 one computes corresponding parameter "E" connected to time with relation () for an elliptic and with relation () for a hyperbolic orbit.
Note that the relations () and () define a mapping between the ranges
Some additional formulae.
"See also Equation of the center – Analytical expansions"
For an elliptic orbit one gets from () and () that
and therefore that
From () then follows that
From the geometrical construction defining the eccentric anomaly it is clear that the vectors formula_104 and
formula_105 are on the same side of the "x"-axis. From this then follows that the vectors
formula_106 and formula_107 are in the same quadrant. One therefore has that
and that
where "formula_108" is the polar argument of the vector formula_109 and "n" is selected such that formula_110
For the numerical computation of formula_108 the standard function ATAN2(y,x)
(or in double precision DATAN2(y,x)) available in for example the programming language FORTRAN can be used.
Note that this is a mapping between the ranges
For an hyperbolic orbit one gets from () and () that
and therefore that
As
and as formula_114 and formula_115 have the same sign it follows that
This relation is convenient for passing between "true anomaly" and the parameter
"E", the latter being connected to time through relation (). Note that this is a mapping between the ranges
and that formula_117 can be computed using the relation
From relation () follows that the orbital period "P" for an elliptic orbit is
As the potential energy corresponding to the force field of relation () is
it follows from (), (), () and () that the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy
Determination of the Kepler orbit that corresponds to a given initial state.
This is the "initial value problem" for the differential equation () which is a first order equation
for the 6-dimensional "state vector" formula_121 when written as
For any values for the initial "state vector" formula_122 the Kepler orbit corresponding
to the solution of this initial value problem can be found with the following algorithm:
Define the orthogonal unit vectors formula_123 through
with formula_124 and formula_125
From (), () and () follows that by setting
one gets a Kepler orbit that for true anomaly formula_59 has the same "r", formula_98 and formula_128 values as those defined by () and ().
If this Kepler orbit then also has the same formula_123 vectors for this true anomaly formula_59 as the ones defined by () and () the state vector formula_131 of the Kepler orbit takes the desired values formula_122 for true anomaly formula_59.
The standard inertially fixed coordinate system formula_134 in the orbital plane (with formula_135 directed from the centre of the homogeneous sphere to the pericentre) defining the orientation of the conical section (ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) can then be determined with the relation
Note that the relations () and () has a singularity when formula_136 and
i.e.
which is the case that it is a circular orbit that is fitting the initial state formula_122
The osculating Kepler orbit.
For any state vector formula_139 the Kepler orbit corresponding to this state can be computed with the algorithm defined above.
First the parameters formula_140 are determined from formula_141 and then
the orthogonal unit vectors in the orbital plane formula_142 using the relations () and ().
If now the equation of motion is
where
is a function other than
the resulting parameters
formula_145
defined by formula_146 will all vary with time as opposed to the case of a Kepler orbit for which only the parameter
formula_59 will vary
The Kepler orbit computed in this way having the same "state vector" as the solution to the "equation of motion" () at time "t" is said to be "osculating" at this time.
This concept is for example useful in case
where
is a small "perturbing force" due to for example a faint gravitational pull from other celestial bodies. The parameters of the osculating Kepler orbit will then only slowly change and the osculating Kepler orbit is a good approximation to the real orbit for a considerable time period before and after the time of osculation.
This concept can also be useful for a rocket during powered flight as it then tells which Kepler orbit
the rocket would continue in in case the thrust is switched-off.
For a "close to circular" orbit the concept "eccentricity vector" defined as formula_150 is useful. From (), () and () follows that
i.e. formula_151 is a smooth differentiable function of the state vector formula_152 also if this state corresponds to a circular orbit.

Battle of Fengqiu

The Battle of Fengqiu was fought between Cao Cao and Yuan Shu in the spring of 193 in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Cao Cao emerged victorious against Yuan Shu's forces.
The battle.
Cao Cao's army was stationed in Juancheng (鄄城). Liu Biao, the Governor (牧) of Jing Province, cut off Yuan Shu's supply route. As a result, Yuan Shu led his army into Chenliu (陳留), garrisoning at Fengqiu (封丘), where the remnants of the Heishan Bandits and the Xiongnu chieftain Yufuluo provided him support. Yuan Shu sent his general Liu Xiang (劉詳) to garrison at Kuangting (匡亭).
When Cao Cao attacked Liu Xiang, Yuan Shu reinforced Kuangting, where the latter was badly defeated. Yuan Shu retreated to defend Fengqiu. Cao Cao subsequently moved to surround the town before Yuan Shu could complete the movement, Yuan Shu fled to Xiangyi (襄邑). Cao Cao pursued to Taishou (太壽) and diverted the waters of the Qu River (渠水) from Xiangyi, cutting off the canal supplying water to the city. After, Yuan Shu fled to Ningling (寧陵) and Cao Cao pursued Yuan Shu retreat towards Jiujiang (九江). In summer, Cao Cao finally withdrew with his army to Dingtao (定陶).

<doc id="18352036" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18352036" title="Gender Equality Duty in Scotland">
Gender Equality Duty in Scotland

The Equality Act 2006 was complemented with specific duties later on. The general Equality Duty states that people should not be discriminated according to their age, race, gender, religion, disability and sexual orientation.
In 2007 the Gender Equality Duty was released demanding that public bodies promote equality of opportunity with a special focus on gender equality. Following this Duty requires acting by the rules posed by the Scottish Government. It is each public body’s duty to publish a gender equality scheme which is to be revised every three years. There also has to be an annual report on what actions were taken to achieve objectives outlined in the equality scheme. Objectives might be about how the authorities plan to abolish discrimination and harassment as well as the pay gap between men and women. But also many other factors play into the Gender Equality Duty. According to Equal Opportunities Commission women and men should also use their right on equality in relation to parental leave after child birth or adoption. Another important factor is that the Gender Equality Duty does not just apply to bigger companies. It also applies to public bodies as schools and to education in general.
It was replaced by a general equality duty under the Equality Act 2010.
Sex discrimination.
According to Equality Commission there are four different kinds of sexual discrimination:
Direct discrimination:
When one is directly discriminated it means that it is obvious to everybody that one is treated less favourably because of one’s sex.
Example:
Harassment:
Harassment is a form of direct discrimination which aims at violating one’s dignity by talking to people in an overly suggestive manner or by touching. This causes an intimidating, degrading, humiliating and even hostile environment at work.
Example:
Indirect discrimination:
Indirect discrimination occurs when the employer applies the same rules or criteria to men and women, but at the same time one sex is put at disadvantage as they cannot fulfill the requirements.
Example:
Victimisation:
Victimisation is defined as treating a person less favourably because they have filed or want to file a compliant about having been harassed or discriminated against.
Equal pay.
The Equal Pay Act 1970 demanded that men and women doing the same work get paid equally. With the Gender Equality Duty in 2007, it was stated that companies and public authorities have to publicly show "how" they want to improve the pay issue as a difference in payment shows gender discrimination. They are controlled regularly whether they achieved their objectives or not. Although the Equal Pay Act came into force almost several decades ago, there is still a pay gap of 15% between men and women doing the same work.
According to the Close the Gap Project, there are several reasons for differences in pay; the first one being that jobs are segregated regarding to gender. So it is normal to press men and women into stereotypical male or female occupations. The majority of women (72%) are employed in public administration, education and health. Typical male jobs are handy work, mechanical work with the 89% of male employees working in the field of construction [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18500/StatisticsWomenMenScot#a6]. It can also be seen that in high management position the percentage of men working there is higher than that of women working in similar positions. Another reason for the Pay Gap is the caring responsibility of women. As many workplaces lack flexible schedules women with caring responsibilities towards old or sick relatives, children or disabled people are more likely to look for part-time work which allows them to be more flexible. This can also be seen when having a closer look at the statistics. According to Esther Breitenbach and Fran Wasoff (A Gender Audit of Statistics: Comparing the Position of Women and Men in Scotland) about 55% of women work part-time as it is one of the work arrangements with flexible working hour, compared to only 22% of men who do use this work arrangement.
In Scotland women earn 12 per cent less per hour than men when full-time salaries are compared. Women working part-time earn 32 per cent less per hour than men working full-time.

<doc id="18352060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18352060" title="Sidney Brown">
Sidney Brown

Sidney George Brown FRS (6 July 1873 – 7 August 1948) was a British electrical engineer and inventor. He is best remembered for his pioneering work on the design of gyro compasses, radio equipment and loudspeakers.
Early life.
Brown was born in Chicago, the son of English parents. In 1879 his family returned to the UK and Brown began his education at a private school in Parkstone, Poole, followed by Harrogate College. During 1894-96 he studied at University College, London, and from 1892 to 1897 was a paying pupil at Crompton & Co. at Chelmsford. After leaving Crompton & Co, Brown returned to the Bournemouth area and in 1899 filed the first of his many patents.
Career.
In 1906 Brown formed the Telegraph Condenser Company (TCC), a manufacturer of capacitors, and in 1911 formed a second company S.G. Brown Ltd. to manufacture telephone equipment, radio parts, headphones and loudspeakers. 
During World War I, S.G. Brown Ltd. set about developing British made gyro compasses. Prior to the war, most gyro compasses had been imported from Germany. Brown's design featured an innovation called liquid ballistic damping, to control the oscillation in the compass caused by a change of course. S.G. Brown Ltd. would go on to become a major producer of gyro compasses for ships and aircraft.
In 1933 the Telegraph Condenser Company became a public limited company. TCC was a leading British maker of capacitors, that was later absorbed into the Plessey company in the 1960s.
Brown retired in 1943 and sold his share of the Telegraph Condenser Company to a consortium, and S.G. Brown Ltd. to the Admiralty. Brown died on 7 August 1948 at Sidmouth, Devon.

Josie Gallagher

Josie Gallagher (1923–1998) was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Gort and with the Galway senior inter-county team from 1942 until 1954. Gallagher is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland medal.
Playing career.
Club.
Gallagher played his club hurling with his local club in Gort, however, he enjoyed little success. His playing days coincided with a downturn in the club's fortunes.
Inter-county.
Gallagher first came to prominence with the Galway senior inter-county team in the 1940s. Galway hurling was in the doldrums at the time. The fact that the county faced no competition in Connacht meant that Galway went straight into the All-Ireland series every single year. This was not a happy hunting ground for the county.
Gallagher first tasted success with Galway in 1951. That year his side reached the finals of the National Hurling League. Galway defeated Wexford and New York giving Gallagher a league title.
Two years later in 1953 Galway defeated a star-studded Kilkenny team in the penultimate stage of the championship. This victory allowed Gallagher's side to advance to the All-Ireland final where Cork provided the opposition. The game itself is remembered as one of the ugliest championship deciders ever and is clouded in controversy due to the injury to the Galway captain, Mick Burke. Galway lost the game by 3-3 to 0-8. After the match at the Gresham Hotel in Dublin a fight broke out when another Galway player struck Cork's Christy Ring. The following morning another fight broke out when another member of the Galway panel attempted to hit Ring. The fights, however, ended just as quickly as they had started.
Gallagher's inter-county hurling career ended in 1954.
Provincial.
Gallagher also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1947 as his side defeated Munster.

Cirillo kidnap

On April 27, 1981, the Red Brigades kidnapped the 60-year-old Christian Democrat (DC) politician Ciro Cirillo and killed his two-man escort in the garage of his Naples apartment building. At the time Cirillo directed reconstruction efforts in Campania devastated by the earthquake in the Irpinia region on November 23, 1980. He was released after a controversial deal with the Camorra.
Natural target.
Cirillo was a key figure in the Campanian regional DC hierarchy. He was the right-hand man of Antonio Gava – one of the national leaders of the Doroteo faction of the DC –, responsible for appointments and public works contracts, and someone who knew a great deal about all the ‘behind the scenes’ deals of local Neapolitan politics. As the regional councillor for urban planning, he was in charge of the reconstruction after the 1980 earthquake. Cirillo was, therefore, a natural target for the Neapolitan column of the Red Brigades led by .
After two and a half months, the Red Brigades threatened to execute Cirillo unless the Naples city government accepted demands it refused in the past. The Red Brigades demanded that the authorities requisitioned housing for thousands of Naples families left homeless by the earthquake. They also demanded increased benefits for the unemployed. None of the political demands of the Red Brigades were met and in the end they accepted that a ransom was enough to release Cirillo.
Release.
He was released after 89 days on July 25, 1981, against the payment of a ransom of one and a half billion lire, thanks to the decisive intervention of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo. Publicly the Christian Democrats had refused to negotiate with terrorists, but privately leading politicians such as Antonio Gava and Vincenzo Scotti, and members of the secret services, such as Pietro Musumeci, visited Cutolo in prison and asked him to negotiate with imprisoned members of the Red Brigades.
In return, Cutolo allegedly asked for a slackening of police operations against the Camorra, for control over the tendering of building contracts in Campania (a lucrative venture since the devastating earthquake in November 1980) and for a reduction of his own sentence – as well as new psychiatric test to show that he is not responsible for his actions. Both these last concessions were granted.
Aftermath.
Cutolo overplayed his hand in the Cirillo affair. His former political protectors turned and provided their support to Carmine Alfieri, his main rival in the bloody 1981-83 Camorra war between Cutolo’s Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) and the Nuova Famiglia. When Cutolo’s main ‘military’ chief, Vincenzo Casillo was killed in January 1983 by the allies of Alfieri, it was clear Cutolo not only had lost his political protection but the war as well.
Many other Camorra gangs understood the shift in the balance of power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri.
The outcome of the Cirillo kidnap stood in sharp contrast to the kidnap of the Italian former Prime Minister Aldo Moro. When Moro was abducted by the Red Brigades in 1978, the Christian Democrats in government immediately took a hardline position: the "State must not bend" on terrorist demands. They refused to negotiate with the Red Brigades, while local Christian Democrats in Campania made every effort and even negotiated with criminals to release Cirillo, a relatively minor politician in comparison with Moro.

Brandywine Shoal Light

The Brandywine Shoal Light is a lighthouse on the north side of the ship channel in Delaware Bay on the east coast of the United States, west of Cape May, Cape May County, New Jersey, United States. It was the site of the first screw-pile lighthouse in the United States.
History.
A lightship was stationed near the shoal starting in 1823; this ship, known as Lightship "N", lasted until 1859, despite an 1838 inspection report characterizing it as being in poor repair. It remained at this station until 1850, with one interruption. In 1827 the first attempt was made to place a fixed light on the shoal. A wood pile structure, it lasted barely a year before heavy seas tore it down. An abortive project, begun in 1835, to design a light on a stone pier at the site was cancelled when the cost proved prohibitive.
The construction of the Maplin Sands Lighthouse in 1838 attracted the attention of American lighthouse designers, who saw the screw-pile technology it introduced as means both to economy of construction and to the simplification of placing foundations in soft bottoms. Major Hartman Bache, who had devised the cancelled stone pier plan, was directed to try the new technique, and assisted by Lt. George Meade he initially constructed a conical iron structure resting on nine piles. This structure was first lit in 1850. It became evident that this was not adequate to resist moving ice, and more piles were sunk in a sort of fence around the light; over the next eight years, sixty-eight piles were placed around the light, and a wooden platform was laid across them. The lighthouse proper rose out of the center of the platform as a short tower.
This light was fitted with a third-order Fresnel lens in 1851, only the third American light to receive the innovation. It was used in a test by the then-nascent Lighthouse Board in which its light was compared with those of the Cape Henlopen and Cape May lights, both fitted with the reflector schemes typical of US lights of the day. The greater brightness of Brandywine Shoals beacon, even though it was much further away from the test point than the other two, was a nail in the coffin for the reflector system, and the board quickly went about installing Fresnel lenses in all lighthouses upon assuming authority in 1852.
The light survived into the next century, but its cramped facilities and concerns about corrosion of the piles led the Lighthouse Board to obtain an appropriation to construct a caisson light at the site. This light, completed in 1914, featured a reinforced concrete superstructure on a cast iron and concrete caisson, resting upon wooden and precast concrete piles. The superstructure of the old light was removed, but the platform remained into the 1950s, used by the Navy for various purposes. In support of this, a small artificial harbor was constructed using a partial circle of riprap; it remains in place, though the last traces of the old light have since been removed.
The Fresnel lens was moved from the old light to the new when the latter was completed, and has since been transferred to the Tuckerton Seaport museum, where it is on public display. The light was automated in 1974, by which time it was the last manned station on Delaware Bay. It continues to serve as an active aid to navigation. The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (reference number 06000943).
In June 2011, the General Services Administration made the Brandywine Shoal Light (along with 11 others) available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them.

The Real Ghostbusters (Video Game)

The Real Ghostbusters, known in Europe as Garfield Labyrinth and in Japan as , is a 1993 action/puzzle video game developed by Kemco and published in Japan and Europe by Kotobuki Systems and in North America by Activision.
The Japanese version is based on Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, which is part of the Mickey Mouse side of Kemco's Crazy Castle series, while the European version is based on Jim Davis's Garfield comic strips and the animated series "Garfield and Friends". The North American version is based on the animated series "The Real Ghostbusters" and contains ten more stages than the previous incarnations.
Gameplay.
Depending on which version is played, the player would play as Mickey Mouse/Peter Venkman/Garfield. It emphasized puzzle-solving in a dungeon-like atmosphere. To advance to each new stage, the player had to collect stars, which would open the door to the next level. In the American version, The player has a proton gun instead of a pneumatic hammer, but it's only effective on blocks at the character's feet, therefore it can't destroy the ghosts (bombs were used to destroy the ghosts). If the player lost all his health (by touching damaging things like ghosts, flames, and reforming blocks), or the 999 second timer wound down to zero, the player would lose a life.
The game had no save feature, but instead, the player would be rewarded with a twelve-digit password after successful completion of a level, which would enable them to start at the end of that level next time they played. An inventory screen is present in the Japanese version of the game.
Before the start of the game, the storyline would feature the two main characters (depending on the version) trying to cross a bridge. When the main character falls down the bridge, he tries to yell at the secondary character for help. All three versions in the game have a variation on the pneumatic hammer; which enhances the puzzle-solving element of the game. Venkman, however, lacks a non-player character companion (from the other Ghostbusters) in the North American version of the game and simply mutters to himself prior to falling through the broken bridge.
Reception.
German video gaming magazine Power Play gave "The Real Ghostbusters" a score of 70% (the equivalent to a letter grade of C) in their November 1993 issue.
Ports.
The game is also available for the Amiga and C64 with differences, under the name P. P. Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon.

Lawrence J. Rosenblum

Lawrence Jay Rosenblum (born 1949) is an American mathematician, and Program Director for Graphics and Visualization at the National Science Foundation.
Work.
Rosenblum received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Ohio State University in 1971. From 1992 to 1994, he was Liaison Scientist for Computer Science at the Office of Naval Research European Office. From 1994 he has been Director of Virtual Reality (VR) Systems and Research at the Information Technology Division of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Program Officer for Visualization and Computer Graphics at the Office of Naval Research (ONR) for ten years. Since 2004 he is Program Director for Graphics and Visualization at the National Science Foundation. 
Rosenblum is on the editorial boards of "IEEE CG&A" and "Virtual Reality". He has guest edited special issues/sections of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (CG&A), Computer, and Presence on visualization, VR, and ARHe. He also has served on both the editorial board and advisory board of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. He was the elected Chairman of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Graphics from 1994–1996 and is currently Director of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee.
Rosenblum received an IEEE Outstanding Contribution Certificate for initiating and co-founding the IEEE Visualization Conference. He serves on the program, conference, and steering committees of numerous international conferences. He is a senior member of the IEEE and a member of the IEEE Computer Society, ACM, and Siggraph.
Work.
Rosenblum's research interests include mobile augmented reality (AR), scientific and uncertainty visualization, VR displays, and applications of VR/AR systems. His research group has produced advances in mobile augmented reality (AR), scientific and uncertainty visualization, VR displays, applications of VR/AR systems, and understanding human performance in graphics systems.
The emergence of scientific visualization.
In the 1990s scientific visualization developed as an emerging research discipline. According to Rosenblum (1994) "new algorithms are just beginning to effectively handle the recurring scientific problem of data collected at nonuniform intervals. Volume visualization today is being extended from examining scientific data to reconstructing scattered data and representing geometrical objects without mathematically describing surfaces. Fluid dynamics visualization affects numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. It has taken its place with molecular modeling, imaging remote-sensing data, and medical imaging as a domain-specific visualization research area". 
Much of the progress in the field of scientific modeling, according to Rosenblum (1994), came "from using algorithms with roots in both computer graphics and computer vision. One important research thread has been the topological representation of important features. Volume and hybrid visualization now produce 3D animations of complex flows. However, while impressive 3D visualizations have been generated for scalar parameters associated with fluid dynamics, vector and especially tensor portrayal has proven more difficult. Seminal methods have appeared, but much remains to do. Great strides have also occurred in visualization systems. The area of automated selection of visualizations especially requires more work. Nonetheless, the situation has much improved, with these tools increasingly accessible to scientists and engineers".
Research trends in Visualization.
The field of visualization has undergone considerable changes since its founding in the late 1980s. From its origins in scientific visualization, new areas have arisen in the new Millennium . These include information visualization and, more recently, mobile visualization including location-aware computing, and visual analytics. Several new trends are emerging. The most important is the fusion of visualization techniques with other areas such as computer vision, data mining and data bases to promote broad-based advances. Another trend, which has not been well met to date by visualization researchers, is for algorithms to be combined with usability studies to assure that techniques and systems are well designed and that their value is quantified. This presentation will discuss current research trends in visualization as well as briefly discuss trends in U.S. research funding.
Foundations of Data and Visual Analytics.
Rosenblum current program responsibilities at the NSF in 2008 is "Foundations of Data and Visual Analytics (FODAVA)" project. Those involved with science, engineering, commerce, health, and national security all increasingly face the challenge of synthesizing information and deriving insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous and possibly conflicting digital data. The goal of collecting and examining these data is not to merely acquire information, but to derive increased understanding from it and to facilitate effective decision-making.
To capitalize on the opportunities provided by these data sets, a new, interdisciplinary field of science is emerging called "Data and Visual Analytics", which is defined as the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. Data and Visual Analytics requires interdisciplinary science, going beyond traditional scientific and information visualization to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and perceptual sciences, decision sciences, and more. This solicitation is concerned only with a subset of the overall problem, namely the creation of the mathematical and computational sciences foundations required to transform data in ways that permit visual-based understanding. 
To facilitate visual-based data exploration, it is necessary to discover new algorithms that will represent and transform all types of digital data into mathematical formulations and computational models that will subsequently enable efficient, effective visualization and analytic reasoning techniques.
Publications.
Rosenblum has published over eighty scientific articles and has edited two books, including Scientific Visualization: Advances & Challenges.

Simi Adobe-Strathearn House

The historic Simi Adobe-Strathearn House served as the headquarters of Rancho Simi, also known as Rancho San José de Nuestra Senora de Altagarcia y Simi, one of the land grants in Alta California by the Spanish government. The name derives from "Shimiji," the name of the Chumash village here before the Spanish.
The headquarters of the rancho served as the home of Robert P. Strathearn (and is thus known as the Strathearn House), built in 1892–93. The home remained in the Strathearn family until 1969, when the dwelling and 5.85 acres (2.37 ha) of surrounding land were donated to the Simi Valley Recreation and Park District. Two rooms of original adobe remain, now located in Robert P. Strathearn Historical Park in Simi Valley, California, which have been designated a California Historical Landmark (#979) and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Strathearn Historical Park and Museum.
The Simi Adobe-Strathearn House is part of the Strathearn Historical Park and Museum, an open air park that is owned and maintained by the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, and is operated jointly with the Simi Valley Historical Society. The house is maintained as a historic house museum with typical period furniture and household displays. 
The park's Visitor's Center features changing exhibits about Simi Valley, and is the start for docent-led park tours. The interior of buildings can only be viewed during the docent-led tours. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday there is one tour leaving promptly at 1:00 p.m.. Saturday and Sunday tours are available from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00.p.m., the last tour leaving at 3:00 p.m.. In addition to the Simi Adobe-Strathearn House, there are various historic buildings and structures that have been moved from their original site to the park, including the 1924 The Montgomery children's playhouse, the 1902 St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, the original Simi Valley Library, a Colony House built in 1888, The Banaga Barber Shop, the Currier pitting shed, and two barns with farm tools and equipment.

Nevitt Sanford

Nevitt Sanford (1909–1996) was professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. He studied ethnocentrism and antisemitism, and was one of the authors of "The Authoritarian Personality". His co-authors in this work were Theodor W. Adorno, Else Frenkel-Brunswik and Daniel Levinson. Sanford studied the interactions between social systems and personality, arguing that social conditions could encourage those with dogmatic biases to persecute those groups against which they were prejudiced.
Sanford was born in Chatham, Virginia, son and grandson of Baptist ministers. He took his first degree at the University of Richmond. All of his brothers also attended and played football at Richmond. Even today, Nevitt still holds the record for the longest run, receiving the kickoff at the end line and running all the way to the end zone. This was followed first by a master's at Columbia University and then a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University. He joined the staff at Harvard Psychological Clinic in 1935. In 1940 he became professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1950 Berkeley dismissed him (and 11 other professors) because of their refusal to sign the loyalty oath. 
After Berkeley, Sanford briefly became a research affiliate at the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations in London before returning to the US to work at Vassar College.
In 1959 as a result of a finding of the California Supreme Court, Sanford was reinstated at Berkeley. Once reinstated, he immediately quit. In 1961 he moved to become a professor at Stanford.
In the 1950s and early 60s he played a lead role in a major study of higher education (publications included: The American College (1962) and "Where Colleges Fail" (1967)). These studies argued that there was an overemphasis on academic publishing – a phenomenon often referred to as the "publish or perish" syndrome, and that this was leading to a deterioration in teaching quality.
In 1968 he founded the Wright Institute.
Sanford was the single or joint author of approximately 200 academic articles and around 12 books.

He became the ruler of Mstsislaw after he captured it from the Principality of Smolensk. He is sometimes mistaken for his brother Constantine, who was the founder of the House of Czartoryski.
After his older brother Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo, Karigaila was baptized as Casimir in Kraków in March 1386. He then left Poland for the eastern part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in order to subdue his half-brother Andrei of Polotsk, who had renewed his struggle for power against Jogaila. On 29 April 1386, he and his other brother Skirgaila soundly defeated Sviatoslav II of Smolensk, who had allied himself with Andrei and attacked Mstsislaw, in the Battle of the Vekhra River. 
During the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–92), Karigaila commanded the defense of the Crooked Castle in Vilnius. The castle fell and he was killed. His brother Jogaila, now king of Poland, charged that Karigaila was taken captive and executed by decapitation by the Teutonic Knights; the Knights denied this and claimed that Karigaila was killed during the battle.

MACSC &amp; Housing

MACSC & Housing, Inc. is a non-profit organization in Houston, Texas, that aims to create lasting, sustainable improvements to Houston communities through prevention, education, and affordable housing. The organization was founded in 1998 by CEO Jacqueline Stewart and currently focuses its efforts on the Sunnyside community in Houston. Its three major programs are the: KINA (Keeping it Nice and) Affordable Housing Program, the Work-Experience Program, and the Youth Education Awareness Program.
History.
MACSC & Housing was founded by CEO Jacqueline Stewart in 1998 as a supportive service agency to assist unemployed and underemployed individuals with child support related issues as they transitioned from welfare to the work force. After becoming pregnant during her freshman year at college, Ms. Stewart was discouraged, but not deterred, and she managed to get through school while supporting her daughter. Once she realized that it was possible to make a good life for her child and for herself amidst her circumstances, Jacqueline was inspired to create the organization. MACSC received non-profit status in 2000 and expanded its vision to better serve the many individuals faced with barriers of unsafe and indecent living conditions and homelessness. In 2003, MACSC was certified by the City of Houston Community Housing Development Department as a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) to provide rental housing and affordable housing to low to moderate income families. Since then, MACSC has focused its efforts primarily on constructing affordable housing, providing work experience opportunities for community residents, and creating youth prevention programs. MACSC has focused its efforts on the Sunnyside community over the years, but seeks to expand programs to reach other Houston neighborhoods in the future.
Programs.
KINA (Keeping it Nice and) Affordable Housing Program
The goal of MACSC & Housing's Affordable Housing Program is to acquire, develop, rehabilitate, manage, and sell housing to individuals in lower income areas in efforts to revitalize impoverished areas and increase family stability. The organization targets the sale of these houses to families earning at or below 80% of the area's median income and who live in a distressed or unstable community.The organization's goal is to create 10 new affordable houses in the Sunnyside area in 2008, and expects to increase production by 70% in 2009. All new homes built by MACSC have been constructed on Coffee and Paula streets in the Sunnyside community. The picture to the right compares two houses on Paula Street, one a MACSC-built house (left) and the other a perfect example of the poverty MACSC is striving to fight in the Sunnyside community. The affordable housing program works in conjunction with the Houston Hope program, led by Mayor Bill White. MACSC administration oversees all aspects of development, including land acquisition, construction, and sale of the houses. The organization also requires individuals to complete a home buyer education program designed to help community members make wise decisions. The topics of this program include community development education, budgeting, and financial planning. Houses are built by employed participants in the MACSC Work Experience Program.
Work-Experience Program
The Work-Experience Program is an internship program designed to give youth parents and GED students real-world work experience, equipping them to be better job seekers with marketable employment skills. Interns in the program go through 9 weeks of training where they get hands-on experience building affordable housing in their own neighborhoods. The program begins with a five week observational period where interns follow construction and administration officials who are working on MACSC & Housing homes so they can learn the skills necessary for the job. Then, they are given a test to assess their knowledge and proficiency, and upon passing are placed in construction teams to build real work experience for four weeks. Workers spend half of their time working on actual construction, and the rest of the time working with the administration. These interns help build all the homes that MACSC constructs under its affordable housing program, thereby building up the community's neighborhoods as well as the skills of the residents. Workers are commonly referred through the Texas Work Source, a partnered organization, and are typically 17–24 years old. MACSC believes that many young people who are on welfare or who lack sufficient job skills have a great amount of difficulty attaining necessary education. The organization works with the philosophy that if these struggling people are given a chance to improve their job skills, they can work hard to attain a higher level of education and better their lives.
Youth Education Awareness Program
MACSC & Housing's Youth Education Awareness Program is a prevention program that intends to keep youth away from negative activities that are often common in poorer neighborhoods. It is split into an internship program and a volleyball program. The program has 3 volleyball teams for different age groups, each called the Inner City Eagles, that are taught by CEO Jacqueline Stewart and play competition from around the city. The program seeks to provide fun activities and a mentor to instill positive values and give guidance to the girls in the program.

Sugar Mountain (song)

"Sugar Mountain" is a song by Canadian folk rock singer and composer Neil Young. Young composed the song on November 12, 1964 – his 19th birthday – at the Victoria Hotel in Fort William, Ontario (now Thunder Bay), where he had been touring with his Winnipeg band The Squires. Its lyrics are reminiscences about his youth in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Releases.
Young first recorded the song on November 10, 1968, as part of a live performance at Canterbury House in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This recording was released as the B-side of Young's 1969 single "The Loner" (and again as the B-side of the "Cinnamon Girl" single later that year), but was not collected on an album until the 3-record compilation "Decade" was released in 1977. A CD/DVD release of recordings from the Canterbury House performance, "Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968", was released November 25, 2008 as part of Young's ongoing "Archives Performance Series".
A live acoustic rendition is included as the first track of Young's 1979 album "Live Rust".
Meaning of the lyrics.
In a concert at The Paris Theatre in London on October 29, 1970, Joni Mitchell, who was already friends with Neil Young by the time he wrote this song, opened her song "Circle Game" with this speech:

Alberto Henschel

Alberto Henschel (13 June 1827 – 30 June 1882) was a German-Brazilian photographer born in Berlin. Considered the hardest-working photographer and businessman in 19th-century Brazil, with offices in Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo, Henschel was also responsible for the presence of other professional photographers in the country, including his compatriot Karl Ernest Papf—with whom he later worked.
Henschel became known for making pictorial representations of Rio de Janeiro as a landscaper photographer and for being an excellent portraitist. He earned the title of "Photographo da Casa Imperial" ("Photographer of the Royal House"), allowing him to photograph the everyday life of the Brazilian monarchy during the Reign of Pedro II, even photographing the emperor Dom Pedro II and his family. This title would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price.
But his principal contribution to the history of Brazilian photography is his photographic record of the different social classes in Brazil in the 19th century: portraits, usually in the "carte de visite" format, taken of the nobility, of rich tradesmen, of the middle-class, and of black people, either slaves or free, in a period before the "Lei Áurea".
Antecedents.
As soon as the first world maps showing Brazil were printed in the Renaissance era of Albrecht Dürer, the recently discovered country aroused the interest of the German public. Among the first attractions were the enthusiastic descriptions and illustrations of the Indians, the exotic landscapes, the abundance of wild animals and the new species of plants first conveyed in the works of Hans Staden. This was followed by the writings of adventurers and scientists such as Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl, author of "Viagem no Interior do Brasil, Empreendida nos Anos de 1817 a 1821 e Publicada por Ordem de Sua Majestade o Imperador da Áustria Francisco Primeiro" ("Voyage in the Interior of Brazil. Launched in the Years of 1817 to 1821 and Published by the Order of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria Franscisco First"), in which he describes his journey through the country with wonder and enthusiasm, his words accompanied by luxuriant illustrations. About Rio de Janeiro, Pohl wrote:
If some place in the New World deserves, for its location and natural conditions, to become one day a theater of big events, a center of civilization and culture, an emporium of worldwide commerce, it is, in my opinion, Rio de Janeiro. I cannot, here, repress this observation. Willingly hovers the fantasy on the future of such charming country, that is at present little developed and, so to speak, does not have a past.—Johann Emmanuel Pohl
Certainly these narrations and illustrations were the principal attractions for those German photographers of the 19th century that moved to Brazil, such as Revert Henrique Klumb, Augusto Stahl, Karl Ernest Papf, and Alberto Henschel.
Life.
In Germany.
Alberto Henschel was born 13 June 1827 in Berlin to Moritz and Helene Henschel. Moritz and his brothers August, Friedrich, and Wilhelm, of Jewish origin, had arrived in Berlin around 1806. They were recognized as engravers and signed their works as "Henschel Brothers". There are no records of Alberto Henschel's person or professional life in Germany or his reasons for emigrating to Brazil.
It has been assumed that Alberto Henschel also met the photographer Francisco Benque while still in Germany, with whom he had a successful, but short-lived, relationship in Brazil.
In Brazil.
1860s.
Henschel and his associate Karl Heinrich Gutzlaff disembarked in Recife in May 1866, intending to create a photographic studio on Imperador street, number 38. Initially named "Alberto Henschel & Cia", the studio became "Photographia Allemã" ("German Photography"), next changing to a new address on the Matriz de Santo Antônio square, number 2. Because he was able to build up his business quickly when he came, it is assumed that Henschel was already an experienced photographer and intended to build a promising business in photography in this new market that was still so little explored.
In 1867, Henschel separated from Gutzlaff and returned to Germany where he updated his technique and acquired new equipment for his atelier of photography. He returned to Brazil in the same year, opening another establishment with the same company name in the city of Salvador, on Piedade street, number 16. By opening three establishments in only two years, Henschel was thought of as the most audacious and sagacious photographic businessman in 19th century Brazil.
By the end of the 1860s, Henschel's houses of Recife and Salvador were already making portraits of people of African origin, slaves and free, differing from other photographers by portraying them freely and with dignity as people and not as objects.
1870s.
In 1870, Henschel opened another subsidiary of his atelier, this time in Rio de Janeiro, on Ourives street (nowadays Miguel Couto street, number 40). It was in Rio, capital of the Empire, where he started his prosperous partnership with Francisco Benque. With the name of "Henschel & Benque", it specialized in the production and marketing of portraits, landscapes, and the photopaintings made by Karl Ernest Papf, whose presence in Brazil was due to Henschel. There are no records dating when the relationship with Benque crumbled; it is probable that their association remained until 1880. 
Because of the quality of his work and his success in the Court, Henschel received the title of "Photographo da Casa Imperial" ("Photographer of the Royal House") on 7 September 1874, together with Benque, which would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price. The historian photographer Gilberto Ferrez describes the quality and importance of Henschel as follows:
Henschel participated in many exhibitions of photographs, standing out in the exposition of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in 1872 and 1875, for which he received the Gold Medal in the first edition. He also participated in the IV National Exposition and the Universal Exposition of Vienna, in Austria, where he received the Merit Medal.
1880s.
On 1 February 1882, Henschel inaugurated another establishment, this time in the capital of the province of São Paulo. He gave it the name "Photographia Imperial" ("Imperial Photography") because the name "Photographia Allemã" had already been used since 1875 by the atelier of the photographer Carlos Hoenen. His arrival in São Paulo was considered important because, besides being holder of the prestigious title of "Photographo da Casa Imperial", he came directly from the Court. The newspaper "A Província de São Paulo" (currently "O Estado de S. Paulo"), while describing with minimal details the new atelier in its inaugural day edition, related the enthusiasm with which Henschel was received by the residents of São Paulo.
Henschel died in Rio de Janeiro that same year, only some months after establishing himself in São Paulo. However, his companies, under the command of other businessmen, continued to strategically use his name for many years, taking advantage of the great prestige that the mark "Henschel" had acquired.
Technique.
Henschel was considered the hardest-working photographer and businessman in 19th-century Brazil. He always remained up-to-date with the latest techniques on the photography market. By the time the aesthetic format of photography "carte de visite" became popular, Henschel was already dominating this technique which he used frequently in his establishments.
His studios possessed the latest equipment appropriate for the instantaneous portraits of children who, never still, were the headaches of the photographers. In his announcement in the "Novo Almanach de São Paulo para o Anno de 1883" ("New Almanac of São Paulo for the Year of 1883"), Henschel advertised:
This establishment just received from Europe the negatives for the new process of instantaneous photographies that have so much success there. Through these chichets one can obtain a more perfect portrait of a moving child, of nervous people... The public is invited to come examine in the establishment some portraits obtained by the new process.
The new process referred to in the announcement was the use of dry slabs of transparent gelatin, used as an adhesive layer for the fixation of the silver salts over the paper.
He photographed all the different social classes of Brazil in the 19th century. Besides the Brazilian monarchy and black people, he also photographed the nobility, the rich tradesmen and their families, and the white middle-class.

Foreign Legion (hip hop crew)

The story of Foreign Legion began in the bay area in the late nineties where rappers Prozack Turner and Marc Stretch were both pursuing their careers as emcees separately. The universe brought the two together one fateful afternoon in a run down strip club in a filthy part of town where Stretch was working as the daytime DJ, and Turner working for the company that supplied the strip club with everything from the plastic cups for the “bottomless soda” fountain, to the blue cleaning agent the strippers used to spray down the brass pole between sets. Sharing a love for hip hop music, the two quickly became friends and soon after, band mates. Releasing their first single “Full Time B Boy” on ABB records in 1999 with DJ Design, the group quickly became popular in the bay area, Los Angeles, New York and overseas due to their on stage presence and high powered live shows, complete with costume changes, theatrics and a cynical brand of humor, not normally found in hip hop circles. Releasing their first full length “Kidnapper Van” on Insidious Urban in 2000, led to more critical acclaim, a U.S., European and two Australian tours, and being courted by the Beastie Boys Mike D. and his then label, Grand Royal. 
In 2002, Prozack Turner signed with DreamWorks Records for a solo deal and went on to record “Death, Taxes and Prozack” featuring production by Pete Rock, J Dilla, Madlib and Organized Noize. The album was never officially released due to the label closing its doors, but Foreign Legion returned with their second LP,” Playtight” on Look records, and continued to stay on the road, building a strong fan base from Oakland to Berlin. 
In 2005, fed up with the deal breaking, ball dropping habits of the record industry, Turner started his own label, Hungerstrike Records and released, “Bangathon”, his second solo album, recorded in Ireland with production by Oh No (Stones Throw Records) Jake One (G unit) and featuring Brother Ali (Rhymesayers). The album was an instant success and sent Turner back on the road for the next two years, touring the album three times in Europe, three music videos (one award winning) and traveling everywhere from Dublin, Berlin, Stockholm, and Romania!
Dropping another 6 song EP, "The Secret Knock" in 2008, Marc stretch and Prozack Turner enlisted G Koop (Parliament, George Clinton, Nas, Ice Cube, Jake One, Nelly), and Introbeats as part of the production crew. They went back to Europe again and pillaged the fans with their music. Upon returning the two embarked on their next project, "Night Moves" a full length album and independent film project. They recorded the album, shot and edited the film (written and directed by Turner) and released both in April 2011. The film was only shown at lives shows on the road during their US tour in March 2012, and then once in Oakland, and once in San Francisco.

<doc id="18352564" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18352564" title="P. J. Molloy">
P. J. Molloy

P. J. Molloy (born 30 April 1952) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a left wing-forward for the Galway senior team.
Born in Athenry, County Galway, Molloy first excelled at hurling in his youth. He made his first impression on the inter-county scene when he joined the Galway under-21 team. He made his senior debut during the 1971-72 National Hurling League. Molloy went on to play a key role for Galway for sixteen years, and won two All-Ireland medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on five occasions.
As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, Molloy won five Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a one-time Connacht medallist with Athenry. He also won two championship medals.
Molloy's career tally of 11 goals and 114 points was a record score for a Galway player which stood until it was surpassed by Eugene Cloonan.
Throughout his career Molloy made 35 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1987 championship.
In retirement from playing, Molloy became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he coached Athenry to the All-Ireland title in 1997.
Playing career.
Club.
In 1987 Athenry faced club kingpins Castlegar in the final of the county championship. The veteran Molloy was an inspiration throughout the championship campaign, and a 1-12 to 2-6 victory gave him a coveted championship medal. He later added a Connacht medal to his collection, as Pádraig Pearse's of Roscommon were downed by 4-18 to 0-7. The subsequent All-Ireland saw Athenry face Midleton. Two Kevin Hennessy goals and a kicked Colm O'Neill effort secured a 3-8 to 0-9 victory for Midleton and a defeat for Molloy's side.
After three defeats in championship deciders in the intervening years, Athenry finally triumphed again in 1994. A 2-6 to 0-9 defeat of Sarsfields gave Molloy, who came on as a late substitute, a second championship medal.
Inter-county.
As a member of the Galway under-21 hurling team in 1972, Molloy tasted his first success at inter-county level. Galway reached the All-Ireland decider that year with Dublin providing the opposition. Although not included on the starting fifteen, Molloy was introduced as a substitute during the match. A narrow 2-9 to 1-10 victory gave him a coveted All-Ireland medal.
By this stage Molloy had made his senior debut for Galway during the 1971-72 National League. He made his senior championship debut in a 3-19 to 4-10 All-Ireland quarter-final defeat of Kildare in 1974.
In 1975 Galway made a long-awaited breakthrough. A 4-9 to 4-6 defeat of Tipperary gave Molloy a National Hurling League medal. Galway later qualified for an All-Ireland final meeting with reigning champions Kilkenny, their first appearance in the championship decider in seventeen years and the very first seventy minute final. Playing with the wind in the first half, Galway found themselves 0-9 to 1-3 down at the interval having played poorly. Early in the second half Kilkenny scored an early 1-3 to put this game to bed, and although Galway did reply with 1-1 and were only four points behind with twenty-five minutes left on the clock, there was never any doubt in this match. Galway were eventually defeated by 2-22 to 2-10.
Galway faced All-Ireland semi-final defeat over the next three years, however, Molloy was personally honoured in 1977 when he collected his first All-Star award.
Galway shocked four-in-a-row hopefuls Cork in the 1979 All-Ireland semi-final and qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Galway goalkeeper Séamus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam "Chunky" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Molloy's side as Kilkenny went on to win by 2-12 to 1-8.
In 1980 Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Munster champions Limerick provided the opposition on this occasion and an exciting championship decider followed. Goals by Bernie Forde and Molloy meant that the men from the west led by 2-7 to 1-5 at half-time. Éamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second-half. Over the course of the game he scored 2-7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game by 2-15 to 3-9. It was Galway's first All-Ireland title since 1923, with Molloy picking up a coveted winners' medal and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park.
1981 saw Galway reach a third consecutive All-Ireland final and Offaly were the opponents. Everything seemed to be going well for Molloy's side as Galway hoped to capture an unprecedented second consecutive All-Ireland title. Offaly 'keeper Damien Martin was doing great work in batting out an almost certain Galway goal early in the second-half. With twenty-three minutes left in the game Galway led by six points, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Johnny Flaherty hand-passed Offaly's second goal with just three minutes remaining. At the long whistle Galway were defeated by 2-12 to 0-15.
Galway reached the All-Ireland decider once again in 1985. Offaly provided the opposition once again and another tense game ensued. Once again it was Offaly’s goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P. J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2-11 to 1-12 score line resulted in defeat for Galway.
Galway reached a second successive All-Ireland decider again in 1986. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tomás Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped "the Rebels" to a 4-13 to 2-15 victory.
In 1987 Molloy was in the twilight of his career as Galway qualified for a third All-Ireland final in-a-row. The prospect of becoming the first team to lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team as Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game was not a classic by any standard and Noel Lane got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. Molloy started the game on the bench but was introduced as a substitute. A 1-12 to 0-9 victory gave him a second All-Ireland medal. This victory brought the curtain down on his inter-county career.
Inter-provincial.
Molloy also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success.
In 1979 Molloy was at left wing-forward as Connacht reached the inter-provincial decider. A 1-13 to 1-9 defeat by Leinster was the result on that occasion. Molloy retained his position on the team in 1980 as Connacht faced Railway Cup specialists Munster in the decider. A low-scoring game followed, however, a 1-5 to 0-7 victory gave Connacht their first Railway Cup title since 1947. It was Molloy's first winners' medal in the inter-pro competition. 
Connacht reached the Railway Cup final again in 1982. A 3-8 to 2-9 victory over Leinster gave Molloy his second Railway Cup medal. Defeat of the same opposition in 1983 allowed Connacht to retain the title for the first time in their history.
After defeat to Munster in 1985, both sides renewed their rivalry in the inter-provincial decider again in 1986. A comprehensive 3-11 to 0-11 victory gave Molloy a fourth Railway Cup medal.
In 1987 Connacht faced Leinster in the final once again. A narrow 2-14 to 1-14 victory to Connacht gave Molloy a fifth and final Railway Cup medal.
Managerial career.
Athenry.
In 1996 Molloy was appointed manager of the Athenry senior hurling team. It proved to be a very successful debut year as he subsequently guided the team to a championship title following a 2-6 to 1-6 defeat of Carnmore. Athenry later took the Connacht title following a 1-15 to 1-8 defeat of Four Roads, before later reaching the All-Ireland decider against Wolfe Tones. Nine points from Eugene Cloonan helped Athenry to a 0-14 to 1-8 victory. It was the club's first All-Ireland title.
Athenry surrendered their titles in 1997, with Molloy stepping down as manager.

Great Gaddesden

Great Gaddesden is a village and civil parish in Dacorum Hundred in Hertfordshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills, north of Hemel Hempstead. The parish borders to Flamstead, Hemel Hempstead, Nettleden and Little Gaddesden and also to Studham in Bedfordshire.
The Church St. John the Baptist was probably the site of a pre-Christian sanctuary. The church shows features of every period since the 12th century. Part of the chancel with Roman bricks dates back to the early 12th century. The old church was extended by the south aisle in the 13th century and the north aisle in the 14th century, the west tower was built in the 15th century and the north chapel in the 18th.
The medieval convent of St Margarets stood northwest of the village. For a while the site later served as a WW2 RCAF transit camp, a reform boarding school, and now as a Buddhist monastery, Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, complete with temple.
Gaddesden Place, positioned east of the small village was built from 1768 to 1773 for the Halsey family. It is surrounded by a huge park. In 1905 a fire destroyed the interior of the main house.
The River Gade has its name from Gaddesden. Its clear water is used for watercress beds along the river and at Water End south of Great Gaddesden is an old corn mill provided by the stream. The bridge over the river at Water End has a medieval appearance but was built in the 19th century.

USS Penobscot (ATA-188)

USS "Penobscot" (ATA-188/ATR–115) -- a "Sotoyomo"-class auxiliary fleet tug -- was originally placed in service by the U.S. Navy as USS "ATA–188" until she was renamed USS "Penobscot" (ATA-188) 16 July 1948. She served in the Pacific Ocean during World War II, and on the U.S. East Coast after the war’s end. She was finally decommissioned in 1971.
Built in Orange, Texas.
The third ship to be so named by the U.S. Navy, "Penobscot" (ATA–188), an auxiliary ocean tug, was laid down as ATR–115 by Levingston Shipbuilding Company, Orange, Texas, 11 September 1944; launched 12 October; and placed in service 12 December.
World War II service.
Following shakedown "Penobscot" was designated for duty in the Far East. Assigned homeyard at Pearl Harbor, she provided extensive advanced base towing services and called at numerous islands as events in the march towards victory in the Pacific reached a crescendo. With the end of hostilities, the ocean tug operated for a short time out of Chinese ports.
Post-war service.
In April 1946 "Penobscot" returned to home waters and was assigned to the 3rd Naval District. From this point she commenced a lengthy career of east coast towing operations. As a 3rd Naval District ship homeported at New York City and berthed at the Naval Supply Center, Bayonne, New Jersey, she spent an average of half of each year away from home port, ranging from Maine to the Caribbean Islands.
In addition to towing assignments, "Penobscot" conducted torpedo and naval mine recovery operations, and provided a wide range of services to ships of the Fleet. One demonstration of her operational flexibility occurred in May 1967 when she assisted USNS Mission Capistrano in oceanographic research off Bermuda.
In July 1967 she shifted from the 3rd Naval District List to the Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. After overhaul at Coastal Shipyard and Drydock Company, Staten Island, New York, that autumn, "Penobscot" resumed her multifarious tasks, nearly every aspect of which involves the rendering of service to the Fleet.
Decommissioning.
After being decommissioned in 1971, she was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and was sold after being struck from the Navy List 28 February 1975.

Alex Perelson

Alex Perelson (born December 5, 1990, San Diego, California) is a professional skateboarder living in San Diego. Perelson began vert skateboarding in 1999 and turned professional in 2005.
Career.
Perelson has been referred to as "San Diego's Favored Son" and according to one appraisal:
Not since the coming of fellow skateboarders Shaun White and Ryan Sheckler has there been a young skater who poses such dominant talent in his age group...the consensus is unanimous; Alex Perelson is the future of vert skateboarding.
According to an article about him in the North County Times, Perelson wanted to become a professional skateboarder from the time he started skating at age nine.
"It looked like fun," Perelson said, "so I got one (skateboard) of my own and started doing it more and more, and pretty soon I was at the skatepark six hours a day."
At thirteen years old, he won first place at the Dam Am Vert competition in Costa Mesa, California and did a 540 in his final run. His professional career began in 2005 when, at age sixteen, he took second place at the LG Action Sports World Championship in Manchester, England and received a $20,000 prize. He has since appeared at events in Copenhagen, Mexico City, Dubai, and various locations within the United States.
In order to better pursue his career, Perelson withdrew from Grossmont High School in 10th grade in order to attend San Diego Charter School and to be allowed more flexibility in his schedule. His choice has meant missing high school football games and proms but he remarked "I wouldn't go to those anyways".
He is the youngest skater in the vert field and is also the only rookie. He competed in the AST Dew Tour 2007 and finished sixth out of the ten riders, telling the Washington Post in an interview, "Those are probably the best runs I've ever done in my life." He won an $8000 prize for fourth place at the X Games in Los Angeles "with back-to-back 540s and 720s in his run."
He then qualified for the AST Dew Tour on his first attempt at the Panasonic Open, and secured a nomination for the "PlayStation Trick of the Week" at the Right Guard Open that same season which was, according to an article in The San Diego Union-Tribune, a "breakout summer" for the young athlete.
Regarding his long range career goals, the young athlete has said:
Tony Hawk is (39) and is able to do a lot of stuff...I don' t know what it takes to skate when you are that old, but hopefully I can do it. I want to keep skating for as long as I can.
In July 2009, at the Maloof Money Cup presented by Monster Energy Drink in Costa Mesa, California, he became the 4th person ever to pull the 900. He won $75,000 and did the 900 to secure his number one spot in the vert competition.
Sponsorship.
Perelson's skateboarding sponsorship now includes 187 Pads, Monster Energy Drink, Sun Diego Boardshops, Vans, Volcom, Protec and Real Skateboards.
Personal life.
Perelson formerly lived in Bonita, California. He has an older sister and a younger brother named Brandon, who is also a skater; his father, Glenn, is a cardiologist.

Knetsch v. United States

Knetsch v. United States, 364 U.S. 361 (1960), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court concerning taxation law.
The taxpayer was a saver who was convinced to buy a deferred annuity because the inside buildup on such policies is tax-deferred. However, he wanted to claim a deduction on the money he borrowed that he used to buy the annuity. The IRS won and the taxpayer was denied the deduction. An understanding of the economics would immediately reveal that the only reason the transaction had any chance of making sense for the taxpayer was the asymmetric way the-then current tax code allowed a current deduction on the loan liability at the same time allowed tax deferral on the purchased asset. Success would have legitimated tax arbitrage.

Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal

Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal (Portuguese: "Dona Maria Teresa da Imaculada Conceição Fernanda Eulália Leopoldina Adelaide Isabel Carolina Micaela Rafaela Gabriela Francisca de Assis e de Paula Gonzaga Inês Sofia Bartolomea dos Anjos de Bragança") (24 August 1855 – 12 February 1944) was a Princess of the House of Braganza. She became by marriage an Archduchess of Austria and the sister-in-law of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.
Early life.
Maria Teresa was born in Kleinheubach, Kingdom of Bavaria the second daughter of Miguel I of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Her father became king of Portugal in 1828 after deposing his niece Queen Maria II. He reigned until 1834 when Maria II of Portugal was restored and Miguel was forced into exile.
Described as one of the most beautiful women in Europe, Maria Theresa married as his third wife Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, a younger brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, at Kleinheubach on 23 July 1873. Despite providing him with two daughters Archduchess Maria Annunziata of Austria (1876–1961) and Archduchess Elisabeth Amalie of Austria (1878–1960), the marriage was an unhappy one due to her husband's bullying and tormenting of her. In addition to their daughters she also became the step mother to his children by his second wife, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Archduke Otto Franz of Austria, Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Austria and Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria.
Maria Theresa managed to obtain considerable influence at the Austrian court when Empress Elisabeth effectively withdrew from the social scene in Vienna after the suicide of her only son, Crown Prince Rudolf, in January 1889. Maria Theresa stood in for the Empress and carried out honours at the Hofburg Imperial Palace with the Emperor until the death of her husband in 1896 when court etiquette ruled she had to go into retirement.
Widowhood.
She remained such an influential figure behind the scenes at court after the death of her husband that when rumors spread that she was to marry the master of her household, Count Cavriani, no one dared to say a word against her. In the end the rumors turned out to be false. During her widowhood she spent the winter months living in Vienna and the summer months at Reichstadt castle in Bohemia.
She offered encouragement and support to her stepson Franz Ferdinand in his determination to marry Countess Sophie Chotek against his family's will. She traveled to a convent in Prague herself to fetch Sophie and took her into her own house, even pleading on Sophie's behalf with the Emperor Franz Joseph. After the union was finally permitted, Maria Theresa made all the arrangements for the wedding, insisting that it take place in her own private chapel.
She remained close to Franz Ferdinand and Sophie until their assassination in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. It was she who broke the news of the couple's death to their children Sophie, Maximilian and Ernst. She also managed to ensure the children's financial security after telling the Emperor that if he did not grant them a yearly income, she would resign the allowance which she drew as a widow in their favour. (The majority of Franz Ferdinand's property went to his nephew the Archduke Charles).
On 21 November 1916, her brother-in-law Emperor Franz Joseph died, and Archduke Karl of Austria the son of Archduke Otto Franz of Austria and nephew of Franz Ferdinand became the new Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. He would reign until November 1918 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed following its defeat in the First World War. After his abdication, Maria Theresa accompanied Karl and his wife Zita into exile in Madeira, but eventually returned to Vienna where she spent the rest of her life.
In 1929, following a decline in her finances, Maria Theresa engaged two agents to sell the Napoleon Diamond Necklace, a piece inherited from her husband, in the United States. After a series of botched sales attempts, the pair finally sold the necklace for $60,000 with the aid of the grand-nephew of Maria Theresa, the Archduke Leopold of Austria, Prince of Tuscany but he claimed nearly 90% of the sale price as "expenses". Maria Theresa appealed to the United States courts, ultimately resulting in the recovery of the necklace, the imprisonment of her grand-nephew, and the absconding of the two agents.
Maria Theresa died in Vienna during World War II. She survived her husband by 48 years.

Jankomir

Jankomir () is a neighborhood in Zagreb, Croatia. It is located in the Stenjevec city district in the western part of the city, and is officially referred to as "Stenjevec - jug", with an area of and a population of 8,072.
Jankomir is regarded citywide as a shopping destination since it houses several shopping centers. Its main arterial roads are Velimir Škorpik Road, Ljubljanska Avenue and Zagrebačka Avenue. Before the advent of the shopping centers Jankomir was mostly known for the nearby Jankomir interchange, a major interchange of the Zagreb bypass and Ljubljanska Avenue. Jankomir is also home to a psychiatric hospital of the same name.
Shopping centers.
After Croatia became independent in the 1990s, its capital city Zagreb gained influence and its economy boomed, attracting big store chains and shopping centers. Hoping to find way for cheap real estate, the shopping center operating companies pointed out mostly Jankomir because it was at that time on the sheer outskirts of the city, close to the inhabitants, inside the city proper and also with a low land price. The east was also an option, but few shopping centers settled there because the city was primarily expanding to the west and most of the Peščenica – Žitnjak district southeast of Radnička Road and Slavonska Avenue was inhabited by poor Romani immigrants.
One of the first shopping centers to open was bauMax in 2000. Many others followed along the Škorpikova Road, including Solidum and Pevec in 2003. Soon, a cluster of centers beginning with King Cross and Bauhaus opened near the intersection with the Ljubljanska Avenue, directly accessible from the highway and only a few hundred meters from the Zagreb bypass. Škorpikova Road today also hosts supermarkets selling only food products, such as Lidl. A number of other services and amenities are available at the shopping centers, such as ATMs, restaurants and free parking. A major problem for the shopping centers is mass transit, which is virtually nonexistent, although cars tend to bring enough customers. The intersection of Velimir Škorpik Road and Ljubljanska Avenue was recently upgraded to an interchange and it still experiences moderate congestion, worsened at the rush hour and near the end of shopping center working time. The latest addition to the shopping center repertoire is City Center One, located in the southwest, at the intersection of Jankomir Road and Savska Opatovina, close to a new roundabout with Ljubljanska/Zagrebačka Avenue.
After the construction of the Jankomir shopping district, Zagreb now competes with Graz, Austria for the title of the main shopping destination of the western part of the former Yugoslavia.
Road infrastructure.
Before the shopping industry, Jankomir was best known for the Jankomir Bridge, a two-lane beam bridge used for car traffic going towards the A3 highway to Samobor or Slovenia. The bridge was built in 1958, project having been made by Krunoslav Tonković. Being 330 meters long, it crosses the Sava River. The bridge was used as a part of the Highway "Brotherhood and Unity" (until the Zagreb bypass was constructed) and later Ljubljanska Avenue. As the Zagreb grew, the bridge's main use shifted from serving transit traffic with touristic and intercity travel purpose, to being used mostly by commuters from outer suburbs. The traffic situation worsened, but nothing was ever done to prevent the congestion. Only after the Škorpikova Road/Ljubljanska Avenue interchange did the construction of the second roadway start. The bridge was finally completed in 2006, having four lanes complete with street lighting. The speed limit was lifted from to .
The other part of road infrastructure Jankomir is well known for is the Jankomir highway interchange on the Zagreb bypass. The motorways at Jankomir are maintained by Hrvatske autoceste (HAC). The interchange connects A2 and A3 highways with Ljubljanska Avenue. Because of the unusual layout of the modified cloverleaf interchange, as it is formally described, motorists on the A3 have to take an exit to continue straight. This layout is in use due to the A3 formerly serving as a part of the Highway "Brotherhood and Unity" until the Croatian War of Independence. The interchange is a structure of utmost importance. With over 110,000 cars using the interchange daily, Jankomir interchange is the third-busiest interchange in Zagreb (with Ivanja Reka and Lučko interchange surpassing its traffic levels). A3 west of the interchange uses a faux collector–distributor road scheme (the traffic flows don't converge back to A3 before the Jankomir interchange in the east) until the Rakitje/Ježdovec exit for the Lučko Airport. On this stretch, the highway has 5 lanes going westbound and 4 lanes eastbound. Together with another collector–distributor system inside the interchange adding to this one, the interchange is often complex to navigate, some turns requiring the motorist to take up to 4 exit ramps to reach their destination, although the interchange makes up for this in extensive signage. Due to the collector–distributor systems gaining more total lanes in the interchange, jams on the exit ramps are extremely rare.
Geography and cityscape.
Apart from the abovementioned shopping centers situated mostly along the southern end of Škorpikova Road, Jankomir is mostly industrialized. The hilly Susedgrad is located directly north of Jankomir, but Jankomir is mainly on flat land. The informal northern border of the neighborhood is always determined as either Bologna Alley or the rail line running on its southern side. The rail line was the primary transportation problem of Jankomir for decades. East of Stenjevec, the line is elevated, allowing roads to pass under it. In Jankomir the only road passing under the line is Škorpikova Road, which requires an interchange with Bologna Alley to avoid a steep grade between the intersection and rail underpass. A solution has recently been provided in the form of more underpasses, but elevating the rail line still remains a taboo for mayors.
Even with the level of industrialization and commercialization, Jankomir does have pockets of family houses. Although not as rural anymore and mostly built on subdivided parcels, residential parts are mostly on the Samoborska Road, located within walking distance of the railway. At the east, nearing Malešnica, the expansion of inner city is inevitable, sporting multi-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings. There are no schools in Jankomir yet, so most students attend Ban Josip Jelačić or Dragutin Domjanić elementary schools.

Ottfried Neubecker

Ottfried Neubecker (22 March 1908 - 8 July 1992) was a German vexillologist and heraldist.
Early life and education.
He was born 22 March 1908 in Berlin-Charlottenburg in Germany, into the family of a university teacher. From 1925 he studied in Heidelberg, Geneva and Berlin and from 1926 he worked for Ministry of the Interior and for the "Reichskunstwart" Edwin Redslob, in field of national heraldic and vexillological matters.
Career.
His first work was "Die Reichseinheitsflagge", published with Erik Wolf in 1926. This small tract was about the dispute between the black-red-gold and black-white-red colors in Germany. The work was expanded in 1929 and published as "Die deutschen Farben". In 1931 he earned doctorate with the thesis "Das deutsche Wappen 1806-1871". In those years he (mainly anonymously) began the series of cigarette cards (with their corresponding albums) showing German flags, flags of the world, state coats of arms of the world, German military colors and German civic coats of arms. Each series consisted of 200-500 cards and there were 12 series.
In 1931 Neubecker had married a woman of Jewish descent and was dismissed from state services. During the Nazi regime he received commissions from the state and municipal archives, Ministry Foreign Affairs, the Air Ministry and from Kriegsmarine, but his name could not be mentioned and his great book "Flaggenbuch des Oberkommandos der Kriegsmarine" was published without Neubecker's name. He was paid clandestinely and unofficially for this work. From the summer of 1944 he was without a permanent residence, being continuously on the run from the Gestapo, surviving with the help of friends.
After the war he lived in East Germany and here he was consulted about municipal and state heraldry, and he lectured, wrote and published many articles. His wife settled in West Germany and in 1950 they were divorced and he remarried. In 1962 he escaped from East to West Germany, luckily with his archive.
In 1965 he participated in the First International Congress of Vexillology and was a Councillor of the Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques (FIAV) from 1969 to 1973, he was President of FIAV from 1973–1981 and Secretary General of FIAV from 1981-1983. He was posthumously named a Laureate of FIAV in 1999 at the 18th International Congress of Vexillology in Victoria, British Columbia. He was Member of the Board of the "Académie Internationale d'Héraldique" (International Academy of Heraldry), Founder, President and Honorary President of the Wappen-HEROLD of the "Deutsche Heraldische Gesellschaft e.V." (German Heraldic Society), and an honorary and corresponding member of many national and international heraldry associations.
He died in Wiesbaden 8 July 1992.

Ljubljanska Avenue

Ljubljanska Avenue is one of most travelled thoroughfares in Zagreb, Croatia. It is a four-lane divided avenue that runs from the Savska Opatovina rotary (located in the western part of the Trešnjevka - sjever district) in the east to the Jankomir interchange with the Zagreb bypass in the west. The road uses the recently upgraded Jankomir bridge over the Sava river and it is fully grade-separated.
The "Ljubljanska" used to start further east, at the intersection with the Savska Road in the outer city center, but the recently renovated part between Savska Road and Savska Opatovina was renamed to Zagrebačka Avenue.

Tangihanga

Tangihanga, or more commonly, Tangi, is a traditional Māori funeral rite held on a marae. While still widely practised, it is not universally observed in modern times. 
Each iwi (tribe/nation) differs on how they honour those who pass. "Tangihanga" generally take three days with burial on the third day. From the moment of death, the "tūpāpaku" (body of the deceased) is rarely alone. The tūpāpaku is transported (usually from a hospital and via a funeral home) to the marae. There they are welcomed with a "pōwhiri" and will lie in state for at least two nights, usually in an open coffin in a tent, on the māhau (porch area of the wharenui), or inside the wharenui proper depending on the tikanga of the marae.
Throughout the tangihanga, the tūpāpaku is flanked by the "whānau pani" (the bereaved family) (sometimes called the "kirimate" or mourners), who take few and short breaks, dress in black, and sometimes wreath their heads in "kawakawa" leaves. Around the coffin, flowers and photographs of deceased relatives are placed.
Visitors come during the day, sometimes from great distances despite only a distant relationship, to address the deceased. They may speak frankly of his or her faults as well as virtues, but singing and joking are also appropriate. Free expression of grief by both men and women is encouraged. Traditional beliefs may be invoked, and the deceased is told to return to the ancestral homeland, Hawaiki, by way of "te rerenga wairua", the spirits' journey. The close kin may not speak. It is traditional for mourners to wash their hands in water and sprinkle some on their heads before leaving the area where the tūpāpaku lies in state.
On the last night, the "pō whakamutunga" (night of ending), the mourners hold a vigil and at a time assigned by custom (sometimes midnight, sometimes sunrise) the coffin is closed, before a church or "marae" funeral service and/or graveside interment ceremony, invariably Christian in modern times. As with the area the tūpāpaku lies, it is traditional for mourners to wash their hands in water and sprinkle some on their heads before leaving the cemetery. After the burial rites are completed, a "hākari" (feast) is traditionally served. Mourners are expected to provide "koha" or gifts towards the meal. After the burial, the home of the deceased and the place where he died are ritually cleansed with "karakia" (prayers or incantations) and desanctified with food and drink, in a ceremony called "takahi whare", trampling the house. That night, the "pō whakangahau" (night of entertainment) is a night of relaxation and rest. The widow or widower is not left alone for several nights following.
Both in traditional times and modern, the tangi of high-profile individuals can be both extended and elaborate.
A recent court case ruled that funeral traditions do not over-rule common law.

Acton by-election, 1943

The Acton by-election, 1943 was a by-election held on 12 December 1943 for the British House of Commons constituency of Acton in London.
The seat had become vacant after the death in October of the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Hubert Duggan. He had first been elected at the 1931 general election.
During World War II, the major parties had agreed an electoral pact under which they would not contest by-elections in seats held by their respective parties, and as a result many wartime by-elections resulting in a candidate being returned unopposed. However, other parties and independent politicians were free to field candidates.
Initially there were six candidates but the independent labour and liberal candidates withdrew leaving Walter Padley for the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Edward Godfrey who sought election as an 'English Nationalist' candidate, Independent Dorothy Crisp who wrote for the "Sunday Dispatch" and the official Conservative candidate Henry Longhurst.
During the war Walter Padley had been a conscientious objector. In 1950 he was elected Labour Party MP for Ogmore and served until 1979. 
Godfrey was founder of the English National Association, an organisation with alleged Fascist leanings.
The by-election was held on an electoral roll which had not been updated since 1937.

Early life.
John Mosley came to the Colorado A&M Aggies in 1939 as a National Merit Scholarship student and decided to play football for football coach Harry W. Hughes. When Mosley stepped onto the football field he became the first black college football player in the Mountain States Conference (Skyline Conference) and first in the state of Colorado in over 30 years. Mosley played various positions on the varsity team of the Colorado Aggies between 1940 and 1942, including fullback. John Mosley battled discrimination from other football teams, and with the help of his teammate Lewis "Dude" Dent he was able to break color barriers in sports throughout the Rocky Mountain Region.
John Mosley wrestled for Aggie wrestling coach Julius Wagner at Colorado State during his college days. Mosley won all-conference honors as a wrestler and in his junior and senior years, Mosley was elected to be the class vice president.
World War II.
During the Second World War, he tried to join the United States Army Air Corps but was sent to Fort Sill for artillery training instead, and managed to join the Air Corps only after writing many letters to get into flight school. Mosley then went to the Tuskegee Institute to learn how to fly for the US Army Air Corp, a feat seen in the movie "The Tuskegee Airmen" starring Laurence Fishburne. Mosley stayed in the Army, flying until 1970.

Chimera (software library)

Chimera is a software library created as a research project at UCSB for the C programming language that implements a structured, peer-to-peer routing platform to allow the easy development of peer-to-peer applications.
The project's focus is on providing a fast, lightweight implementation of a system like other prefix-routing protocols such as UCSB's Tapestry system and Microsoft Research's Pastry system, that can be easily used to build an application that creates an overlay network with a limited number of library calls. The library is intended to serve as both a usable complete structured peer-to-peer system and a starting point for further research. It includes some of the current work in locality optimization and soft-state operations.
The system contains both a leaf set of "neighbor nodes", which provides fault tolerance and a probabilistic invariant of constant routing progress, and a PRR-style routing table to improve routing time to a logarithmic factor of network size.
Chimera is currently being used in industry labs, as part of research done by the U.S. Department of Defense, and by startup companies.

Giuoco Piano, Jerome Gambit

The Jerome Gambit is a weak chess opening which is an offshoot of the Giuoco Piano. It is characterized by the moves:
White sacrifices two pieces in hopes of exposing Black's king and obtaining a mating attack. The line is virtually never seen today (and never seen in high-level chess), but was known in the late 19th century. Blackburne wrote of it, "I used to call this the Kentucky opening. For a while after its introduction, it was greatly favoured by certain players, but they soon grew tired of it." 
Discussion.
In the third edition of the opening treatise "Chess Openings, Ancient and Modern" (1896), the authors wrote: The Jerome Gambit is an American invention, and a very risky attack. It is described in the American Supplement to "Cook's Synopsis" as unsound but not to be trifled with. The first player sacrifices two pieces for two pawns, with the chances arising from the adversary's king being displaced, and drawn into the centre of the board. Similarly, du Mont wrote that it "is unsound, but has the saving grace of leading to a lively game and is therefore suitable for an occasional friendly game. The defender cannot afford to be careless."
White may regain one of the two sacrificed pieces with 6.d4, but Black retains a decisive material advantage with 6...Bxd4 7.Qxd4 Qf6. More commonly, White plays 6.Qh5+. In that event, Freeborough and Ranken analyzed two lines. One is 6...Kf8 7.Qxe5 Qe7 8.Qf5+ Ke8 9.Nc3 d6 10.Qf3 Qf7 11.Qe2 Nh6 12.0-0 c6, with large advantage to Black. Freeborough and Ranken also analyze the bold 6.Qh5+ Ke6!? ("follow out Mr. Steinitz's theory that the King is a strong piece") 7.Qf5+ Kd6 8.d4 (or 8.f4 Qf6 9.fxe5+ Qxe5) Bxd4 9.Na3 c6 10.c3 Qf6 11.cxd4 Qxf5 12.exf5 Nf7 13.Bf4+ Ke7, again with a large advantage. A bad line for Black after 6.Qh5+ is 6... Kf6?? 7. Qf5+ Ke7 8. Qxe5+ Kf7 9. Qxc5, regaining both pieces and winning two pawns.
Illustrative game.
N.N. versus Blackburne, England 1880 (according to E. Schiller in "Unorthodox chess openings" the game was in fact Jerome–Blackburne) 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Bxf7+? Kxf7 5. Nxe5+ Nxe5 6. Qh5+ g6?? Blackburne remarks, "Not to be outdone in generosity." Seirawan and Minev observe that after 6...Kf8 7.Qxe5 d6 or 6...Ng6 7.Qxc5 d6 White has insufficient compensation for the sacrificed piece, but Blackburne likes to attack. 7. Qxe5 d6 (7...Qe7) 8. Qxh8 Qh4 9. 0-0 Nf6 10. c3? Better is 10.Qd8! 10... Ng4 11. h3 Bxf2+ 12. Kh1 (see diagram) 12... Bf5! 13. Qxa8 Qxh3+! 14. gxh3 Bxe4#. Having accepted White's sacrifice of two minor pieces, Blackburne responded by returning the knight, then sacrificing both rooks and his queen to deliver checkmate with his three remaining minor pieces.

List of octagonal buildings and structures in the United States

Octagonal buildings and structures are characterized by an octagonal plan form, whether a perfect geometric octagon or a regular eight-sided polygon with approximately equal sides.
Octagon-shaped buildings date from at least 300 B.C. when the Tower of the Winds in Athens, Greece, was constructed. Octagonal houses were popularized in the United States in the mid-19th century by Orson Squire Fowler and many other octagonal buildings and structures soon followed.

Honniasont

The Honniasont (Oniasont, Oniassontke, Honniasontkeronon) were a little-known indigenous people of North America originally from eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. They appear to have inhabited the upper Ohio River valley, above Louisville, Kentucky (Hanna 1911:119 ).
Language.
Honniasont may have been considered an Iroquoian language (Swanton 1953: 55-57). However, James Mooney of the Bureau of American Ethnology (Washington, D.C. 1894) believed their name, first appearing as "Oniasont" on 17th-century French maps, to be a variation of the name of the tribe recorded in West Virginia and western Virginia at the same time period, as "Nahyssan" and "Monahassanough", i.e. the Tutelo, a Siouan language speaking people.

Cardiovascular disease in China

Cardiac disease in China is on the rise. Though incidences of heart disease have increased faster in the city than in the country side, rural morbidity and mortality rates are now on the rise as well. Health statistics shows that the ischemic heart disease mortality rate in rural China has approximately doubled since 1988.
Unlike in developed countries, there is no preventive or primary health care system in place to stop the rise of cardiac disease. The real extent of heart disease in rural China is unknown because statistics are fraught with error and bias due to difficulties in ascertaining cause of death in places where 90% die without seeing a doctor. Therefore there is a need to ascertain the real incidence and prevalence of heart disease and to develop adequate preventive and primary care in the Chinese countryside.

Stroke is the largest cardiovascular killer in China at about 40% of total mortality in 2007 (approx. 280 per 100 000)

Stanhope and Tyne Railway

The Stanhope and Tyne Railway (formally the Stanhope and Tyne Railroad Company) was an early British industrial railway that ran from Stanhope, in County Durham, to South Shields at the mouth of the River Tyne. The railway opened on 15 May 1834, but liquidated on 5 February 1841. Sections of the line were bought by the Derwent Iron Company and the newly created Pontop and South Shields Railway. The railway was built to provide the limestone quarries above Weardale and coal mines in north Durham with an outlet to the Tyne down-river of any bridges. It also supported the growth of the Derwent Iron Company, later known as the Consett steelworks, which became its main freight customer.
Much of the S&T system was built through the moors of County Durham, and encountered difficulties in both construction and operation. When built, the line was long, of which were operated using steam locomotives, used horses, stationary engines worked of inclines and a further three inclines used gravity. The system was gradually expanded and improved throughout the 19th century, not reaching its final form until the 1890s.
The Pontop and South Shields became part of the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway and then the York & Newcastle Railway in 1846, and eventually became part of the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1854. The line sold to the Derwent Iron Company was leased by the Stockton & Darlington Railway from 1847; the Stockton & Darlington also became part of the NER in 1863. The NER was later absorbed by the London & North Eastern Railway, and Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948. Regular passenger services ceased on 23 May 1955, and the line closed in the early 1980s, with the tracks lifted by 1985. Today its main constituent parts are part of the national Sustrans foot and cycle path network.
History.
Construction.
Like many private railways in the area, the purpose of the line was to transport minerals for either shipping or manufacture. On 20 November 1831, William Wallis of Westoe agreed a lease for mineral rights with John Selby under his lands at West Consett. Then on 2 December, Wallis entered into a partnership with Cuthbert Rippon of Stanhope Castle, and William Harrison of Monkwearmouth Grange, to extract coal at Medomsley and limestone from quarries at Lanehead Farmhouse, north of Stanhope, County Durham.
A partnership was formed, named the Stanhope and Tyne Railroad Company, on 20 April 1832. There was agreement for a railway between the lime kilns at Lanehead Farmhouse, and the coal mines at both Consett and Medomsley. After looking at upgrading the existing Pontop Waggonway, they decided to build a new railway, agreeing a lease with owner Charles Smythe for Pontop Colliery.
To avoid the need for raising large amounts of capital and the cost of applying for an Act of Parliament, a Deed of Settlement allowed the railway to be built under wayleaves, gaining access to the land on which the railway was built and subsequently paying a lease fee for its use. The initial section to Consett was over lands owned by the Bishop of Durham. With Robert Stephenson acting as surveyor and consulting engineer, construction started at the Stanhope end in July 1832, with Thomas E Harrison (William's son) as acting engineer.
Operations.
On 15 May 1834, the first section from Stanhope to Annfield opened. The northern terminus was based at the company's lime kilns at Lanehead Farmhouse, above sea level. Wagons were drawn up the Crawley Incline to , and then up the Weatherhill Incline to the summit at . Horses worked the next to Park Head Wheelhouse, before wagons were let down the Park Head incline of and a further on the Meeting Slacks incline into Waskerley. A self-acting bank of followed on a 1 in 14 gradient, called Nanny Mayor's Bank after the owning farmer's wife, before horses worked the next to Healyfield Bridge. Horses then rode in dandy waggons under gravity for via White Hall and Cold Rowley to Hownes Gill. Unable to afford a bridge over the deep and wide dry valley at Hownes Gill, the company hence authorised Stephenson to construct two steep rope-worked inclines, one at 1 in 2.5 and a second at 1 in 3. Single wagons were carried sideways in cradles worked by a single stationary steam engine located at the bottom of the gorge. Horses worked the wagons to .
The line reached South Shields on 10 September 1834 it was long. Only the long section east of Annfield was worked with steam locomotives, as stationary engines worked inclines over , a further three inclines were worked by gravity and the remaining were worked by horses. Except for one locomotive with four uncoupled wheels, the S&T had 0-4-2 locomotives, of which eight were built by Robert Stephenson and Company.
The railway began a passenger service on 16 April 1835 between South Shields and Durham Road, near the corner of Lambton Park. Initially this was using an open wagon attached to a coal train, and then a locomotive hauled a coach every fortnight. This was at a loss and also resulted legal action from a land owner who had his claim upheld in court that carrying passengers was not permitted by the wayleave over his land. The number of passengers increased after 1840 following a working agreement with the Brandling Junction Railway.
Liquidation.
However company was nearly bankrupt, with the lime kilns having closed in 1840 together with the section from Stanhope to Carrhouse and the Stanhope to Annfield section losing money, the company was dissolved on 5 February 1841. The southern section from Stanhope to Carrhouse was sold to the new Derwent Iron Company (DIC) at Consett, (eventually to become the Consett Steelworks), and on 23 May 1842 the northern section became part of the newly created Pontop and South Shields Railway. In a series of amalgamations the Pontop and South Shields became part of the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway and the York & Newcastle Railway in 1846, which was renamed the York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway the following year.
After the West Durham Railway constructed a line to , the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) began construction of the Weardale Extension Railway to Crook, which opened on 8 November 1843, from a junction on its leased Weardale Railway. As a result, the DIC proposed an extension from Crook to the foot of the Meeting Slacks incline, which latter became , to provide a southern shipping route for their lime and iron products. Having obtained an extension of their right of way from the Bishop of Durham, the DIC submitted the plans to the S&DR, who agreed to the extension as long as the DIC leased the entire southern section of the former S&TR to them. The Stanhope to Carrhouse section passed into the possession of the S&DR on 1 January 1845, with the completed Weardale Extension Railway from the to Waskerley opening on 16 May 1845.
On 29 September 1847 the Stockton and Darlington Railway agreed a 999-year lease on the Wear Valley Railway (WVR) (a union of the Wear Valley Railway, the Bishop Auckland and Weardale Railway, the Wear & Derwent Railway, the Weardale Extension Railway and the Shildon Tunnel Company opened on 3 August 1847), and the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway at 6 per cent of the share capital.
Legacy.
Hownes Gill Viaduct.
Having taken over the line, the S&DR proposed to bypass Hownes Gill through construction of a suitable bridge. They commissioned Thomas Bouch to design and supervise the construction of such a structure. Bouch's design was submitted to Stephenson, who recommended the use of inverted arches under the five central piers to reduce ground loading.
The construction tender was won by John Anderson, who started works in 1857, with created to enable the workers to access the site. Three million white firebricks were used in the structure, with sandstone Ashlar dressings, and iron railings along the platform. The completed single-track Hownes Gill Viaduct opened in 1858, long and at maximum high, spanned by twelve wide arches on slender tripple-tiered piers, with arched recesses in three layers on each side.
North Eastern Railway.
The York, Newcastle & Berwick became a founding constituent of the North Eastern Railway in 1854. The Stockton and Darlington was absorbed by the North Eastern Railway in 1863. The section between and was at this time still used steep rope-worked inclines, and so the NER built a loop extension to avoid this. The loop opened for freight trains on 1 January 1886, and passengers on 1 February 1894. The final section of the deviation between Pelton and was opened for freight trains in 1893, and for passenger trains in 1896.
On 1 January 1923 the NER amalgamated with other companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), and Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948. Regular passenger services ceased on 23 May 1955, and the line was closed the early 1980s, with the tracks lifted by 1985.
Present.
Both parts of the former line are now mainly used as foot and cycle paths, with part incorporated into the national Sustrans system. Part of the Consett to Sunderland section of the line has been used as a foot and cycle path, an the section from Stanhope to Consett is now the "Waskerley Way" public footpath.

Hougham railway station

Hougham railway station is a former railway station in Hougham, Lincolnshire which was closed during the cutback of the British Rail network. The station was about a mile east of the village of Hougham itself and was part of the Great Northern Railway. The station was opened on 1 August 1855.
The closure of the station was announced on 17 August 1957 by the British Transport Commission, who confirmed that the station would be declared 'redundant' as passenger train services were withdrawn on 16 September 1957 as well as Claypole.

Lynn Ullom

Lynn Ullom (born 17 July 1960) is the current head women's basketball coach and associate athletic director at West Liberty University in West Liberty, West Virginia.
High School.
Ullom played basketball and ran track at Cameron High School in Cameron, West Virginia. He graduated from Cameron in 1978.
College.
Ullom attended Waynesburg (Pa.) College for one year immediately after high school but worked for two years before returning to college at West Liberty in 1982. He graduated from West Liberty with a B.A. in Social Science Education in 1985.
Early career.
After graduation, Ullom spent two years as a coach and substitute teacher at Cameron High School. He coached boys' basketball (Grades 7-9 and junior varsity) as an assistant under current West Liberty University men's basketball coach Jim Crutchfield.
Ullom left Cameron in 1987 to accept a teaching job at Lakeland High School in Freeport, Ohio. He spent his first year at Lakeland as freshman boys' basketball coach before making the transition to girls' basketball as assistant head coach for the next two years. He also served as head track coach at Lakeland for one year.
Ullom moved into the college ranks in 1991 when he was hired as head women's basketball coach at West Liberty. Since the women's basketball job was only a part-time position at that time, he continued to teach at Lakeland High School for two more years while making the daily 50-mile drive to the West Liberty campus. This continued until 1993, when his role as head women's basketball coach at West Liberty was combined with the job of Sports Information Director to create a full-time position.
Career.
Heading into his 22nd season as head women's basketball coach at West Liberty, Ullom has a career record of 431-199 (.684) to rank among the top 25 active NCAA Division II coaches in career victories and career winning percentage. Ullom's West Liberty teams have posted 14 20-win seasons, won three West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference regular-season championships, five West Virginia Conference tournament championships and advanced to the WVIAC Tournament championship game on 12 different occasions. The Hilltoppers have earned 11 NCAA Tournament bids, most recently advancing to the 2011 NCAA Division II Atlantic Region semifinals.
During Ullom's tenure, his teams have set school records, including wins in a season (27), consecutive wins (15), points in a game (112), and multiple NCAA team and individual statistical championships. His players have also received individual recognition, virtually rewriting the WLU school record book and earning 40 first or second team selections on the All-WVIAC Team. Every women's basketball player who completed her playing career at West Liberty under Ullom has earned her degree.
A two-time WVIAC Coach of the Year recipient (1996, 2000), Ullom had the distinction of becoming the first head coach of a women's sport to receive the West Virginia College Coach of the Year Award in 2001. More recently, he was honored as the 2011 Region 2 Coach of the Year by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA). Ullom owns the most wins of any coach in league history and passed former West Virginia University coach Kittie Blakemore as the all-time winningest collegiate women's basketball coach in the state of West Virginia during the 2006 season. Blakemore had 301 wins in 19 seasons with the Mountaineers. Ullom was inducted into the West Liberty University Hall of Fame in September 2010.
Ullom has been associate athletic director at West Liberty since 2009.

Glarus thrust

The Glarus thrust () is a major thrust fault in the Alps of eastern Switzerland. Along the thrust the Helvetic nappes were thrusted more than 100 km to the north over the external Aarmassif and Infrahelvetic complex. The thrust forms the contact between older (Helvetic) Permo-Triassic rock layers of the Verrucano group and younger (external) Jurassic and Cretaceous limestones and Paleogene flysch and molasse.
The Glarus thrust crops out over a relatively large area in the cantons Glarus, St. Gallen and Graubünden, due to its horizontal orientation and the high local relief. Famous outcrops include those at Lochsite near Glarus (the town) and in a mountain cliff called "Tschingelhörner" between Elm and Flims (in the same cliff is a natural hole called the Martinsloch).
World heritage.
Thrust faults of this kind are not uncommon in many mountain chains around the world, but the Glarus thrust is a well accessible example and has as such played an important role in the development of geological knowledge on mountain building. For this reason the area in which the thrust is found was declared a geotope, a geologic UNESCO world heritage site, under the name "Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona." The area of this "tectonic arena" encompasses 32,850 hectares of mainly mountainous landscape in 19 communities between the Surselva, Linthtal and Walensee. In the arena are a number of peaks higher than 3000 meters, such as Surenstock (its Romansh name is "Piz Sardona", from which the name comes), Ringelspitz and Pizol.
In 2006 the Swiss government made a first proposal to declare the region world heritage to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN then did not find the area to have an extraordinary or universal value and denied the proposal. The Swiss made a new, this time successful proposal in March 2008. The region was declared world heritage in July 2008, because "the area displays an exceptional example of mountain building through continental collision and features excellent geological sections through tectonic thrust."
The American Museum of Natural History in New York exposes a full-scale reconstruction of the Glarus thrust.
History.
The first naturalist to examine the Glarus thrust was Hans Conrad Escher von der Linth (1767–1823). Escher von der Linth discovered that, contradictory to Steno's law of superposition, older rocks are on top of younger ones in certain outcrops in Glarus. His son Arnold Escher von der Linth (1807–1872), the first professor in geology at the ETH at Zürich, mapped the structure in more detail and concluded that it could be a huge thrust. At the time, most geologists believed in the theory of geosynclines, which states that mountains are formed by vertical movements within the Earth's crust. Escher von der Linth had therefore difficulty with explaining the size of the thrust fault. In 1848 he invited the British geologist Roderick Murchison, an international authority, to come and look at the structure. Murchison was familiar with larger thrust faults in Scotland and agreed with Eschers interpretation. However, Escher himself felt insecure about his idea and when he published his observations in 1866 he instead interpreted the Glarus thrust as two large overturned narrow anticlines. This hypothesis was rather absurd, as he admitted himself in private.
Eschers successor as professor at Zürich, Albert Heim (1849–1937), initially stuck to his predecessors interpretation of two anticlines. However, some geologists favoured the idea of a thrust. One of them was Marcel Alexandre Bertrand (1847–1907), who interpreted the structure as a thrust in 1884, after reading Heims observations. Bertrand was familiar with the Faille du Midi (Variscan orogeny), a large thrust fault in the Belgian Ardennes. Meanwhile, British geologists began to recognize the nature of thrust faults in the Scottish Highlands. In 1883, Archibald Geikie accepted that the Highlands are a thrust system. Swiss geologists Hans Schardt and Maurice Lugeon then discovered in 1893 that in western Switzerland, Jurassic rock layers are on top of younger molasse too, and argued that the structure of the Alps is a large stack of nappes, large sheets of rock that had been thrusted on top of each other. At the turn of the century, Heim was also convinced of the new theory. He and other Swiss geologists now started mapping the nappes of Switzerland in more detail. From that moment on, geologists began recognizing large thrusts in many mountain chains around the world.
However, it was still not understood where the huge forces that moved the nappes came from. Only with the arrival of plate tectonic theory in the 1950s an explanation was found. In plate tectonics, the horizontal movement of tectonic plates over the Earth's soft asthenosphere causes horizontal forces within the crust. Presently, geologists believe most mountain chains are formed by convergent movements between tectonic plates.

Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator

In mathematics, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator is a generalization of the Laplace operator to an infinite-dimensional setting. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator plays a significant role in the Malliavin calculus.
Introduction: the finite-dimensional picture.
The Laplacian.
Consider the gradient operator ∇ acting on scalar functions "f" : R"n" → R; the gradient of a scalar function is a vector field "v" = ∇"f" : R"n" → R"n". The divergence operator div, acting on vector fields to produce scalar fields, is the adjoint operator to ∇. The Laplace operator Δ is then the composition of the divergence and gradient operators:
acting on scalar functions to produce scalar functions. Note that "A" = −Δ is a positive operator, whereas Δ is a dissipative operator.
Using spectral theory, one can define a square root (1 − Δ)1/2 for the operator (1 − Δ). This square root satisfies the following relation involving the Sobolev "H"1-norm and "L"2-norm for suitable scalar functions "f":
The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator.
Often, when working on R"n", one works with respect to Lebesgue measure, which has many nice properties. However, remember that the aim is to work in "infinite"-dimensional spaces, and it is a fact that there is no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Instead, if one is studying some separable Banach space "E", what does make sense is a notion of Gaussian measure; in particular, the abstract Wiener space construction makes sense.
To get some intuition about what can be expected in the infinite-dimensional setting, consider standard Gaussian measure "γ""n" on R"n": for Borel subsets "A" of R"n",
This makes (R"n", "B"(R"n"), "γ""n") into a probability space; E will denote expectation with respect to "γ""n".
The gradient operator ∇ acts on a (differentiable) function "φ" : R"n" → R to give a vector field ∇"φ" : R"n" → R"n".
The divergence operator "δ" (to be more precise, "δ""n", since it depends on the dimension) is now defined to be the adjoint of ∇ in the Hilbert space sense, in the Hilbert space "L"2(R"n", "B"(R"n"), "γ""n"; R). In other words, "δ" acts on a vector field "v" : R"n" → R"n" to give a scalar function "δv" : R"n" → R, and satisfies the formula
On the left, the product is the pointwise Euclidean dot product of two vector fields; on the right, it is just the pointwise multiplication of two functions. Using integration by parts, one can check that "δ" acts on a vector field "v" with components "v""i", "i" = 1, ..., "n", as follows:
The change of notation from “div” to “"δ"” is for two reasons: first, "δ" is the notation used in infinite dimensions (the Malliavin calculus); secondly, "δ" is really the "negative" of the usual divergence.
The (finite-dimensional) Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator "L" (or, to be more precise, "L""m") is defined by
with the useful formula that for any "f" and "g" smooth enough for all the terms to make sense,
The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator "L" is related to the usual Laplacian Δ by
The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator for a separable Banach space.
Consider now an abstract Wiener space "E" with Cameron-Martin Hilbert space "H" and Wiener measure "γ". Let D denote the Malliavin derivative. The Malliavin derivative D is an unbounded operator from "L"2("E", "γ"; R) into "L"2("E", "γ"; "H") – in some sense, it measures “how random” a function on "E" is. The domain of D is not the whole of "L"2("E", "γ"; R), but is a dense linear subspace, the Watanabe-Sobolev space, often denoted by formula_9 (once differentiable in the sense of Malliavin, with derivative in "L"2).
Again, "δ" is defined to be the adjoint of the gradient operator (in this case, the Malliavin derivative is playing the role of the gradient operator). The operator "δ" is also known the Skorokhod integral, which is an anticipating stochastic integral; it is this set-up that gives rise to the slogan “stochastic integrals are divergences”. "δ" satisfies the identity
for all "F" in formula_9 and "v" in the domain of "δ".
Then the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator for "E" is the operator "L" defined by

Court of Flags Resort

The Court of Flags Resort was a resort located in Orlando, Florida, USA.
History.
It was built by US Steel in 1972 and opened in 1974. It was a popular upscale resort when it opened, and later in its life it become more of a budget resort. In 2006, it was demolished to make room for the new Citymark of Orlando; this never materialized. It was located near International Drive, on Major Boulevard just across the street from Universal Orlando Resort, and just across the street from the now defunct Mystery Fun House. The lot of the former resort currently sits vacant.
Name changes.
The resort changed names a few times during its life:
Construction.
The Court of Flags Resort is noted for its unique construction type. The rooms were stacked on top of each other and with framing and concrete added around them. They used the same system at the Polynesian Resort and part of the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World.
US Steel thought this new system of building would catch on and revolutionize construction but the system had flaws that were not known until later. The buildings shifted and settled. The air space between the rooms kept too much moisture and let mildew grow.
The resort consisted of four separate guest room buildings. It housed a total of 800 rooms with 16 suites. It also had three pools and three restaurants.

Melodifestivalen 2009

Melodifestivalen 2009 was a Swedish song contest held between February and March 2009. It was the selection for the 49th song to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest, and was the 48th edition of Melodifestivalen. Five semi-finals were held in the Swedish cities of Gothenburg, Skellefteå, Leksand and Malmö, with Norrköping hosting the final "Andra Chansen" (Second Chance) round. 
After the five semi-finals 11 songs had qualified to the final of the contest, contested in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, at the Globe Arena. After the voting of 12 juries and a public televote had been revealed, the final winner was opera singer Malena Ernman with pop/opera song "La voix", which received top marks from the public televote, despite only placing 8th after the votes of the 12 juries.
The 2009 edition of Melodifestivalen implemented a number of new rules which changed the dynamics of the contest, including an increase to the number of people allowed on stage, the allowance of pre-recorded backing vocals, and a new international jury who selected an 11th finalist, and voted in the final.
Rules.
The current rules for Melodifestivalen were first implemented in 2002 – the format consists of five semi-finals held every year: the first four semi-finals each consist of eight songs, in which the top two songs directly qualify to the final of the contest, while the third and fourth-placed songs qualify to the final semi-final, the "Andra Chansen" (Second Chance) round. Eight songs compete in the Second Chance round, competing in a knock-out format until two songs are left, which qualify to the final. These songs are chosen by a public televote held on the night of the contest. The final consisted of 10 songs, who are awarded marks by 11 regional juries of Sweden, alongside televoting, with each constituting 50% of the total result.
28 songs are selected from a public call for songs by SVT. These are chosen from a large number of entries, with over 3000 entries being received by SVT in past contests. These songs are reduced by the Swedish Music Publishers Association ("Svenska musikförläggareföreningen"; SMFF), who reduce this large number to around 1200 entries. A sixteen-person jury reduce this number once again to the final 28 competing songs. These 28 songs are then joined by compositions by four songwriters invited by SVT, who each submit a song into the competition.
For the 2009 contest a number of changes were implemented to this format: the first four semi-finals now include a duel format, with the top four songs competing against each other for a place in the final - the 1st and 4th-placed songs and the 2nd and 3rd-placed songs battled against each other, with the winning songs, as decided by another public televote, qualifying to the final, while the losing songs take part in the Second Chance round.
For the 2009 contest a maximum of eight people were allowed on stage, an increase from the previous maximum of six. As well as this pre-recorded backing vocals were now allowed to be included on the songs' backing tracks, however the main vocals were still required to be performed on stage.
This year also marked the introduction of an "international jury". The jury consists of 12 members, who all work within the music industry, with many involved in Eurovision. The international jury selected one song from each semi-final that did not qualify to the final, focusing their decision on their suitability for Eurovision. After the Second Chance round had finished, the jury selected their preferred song from the remaining entries, which qualified to the final, becoming the 11th finalist. The international jury also voted during the final of the contest, becoming the 12th jury, alongside the 11 regional juries of Sweden.
Details.
On 11 September 2008 the six cities that were to host Melodifestivlan 2009 were announced: the first semi-final would be held in Sweden's second city, Gothenburg – at the Scandinavium; this was followed by semi-finals in the Skellefteå Kraft Arena, the Ejendals Arena in the small town of Leksand, and in the newly constructed Malmö Arena in Malmö. The Second Chance round was in the Himmelstalundshallen in Norrköping, while the grand final would once again be held at Globen in Stockholm.
The dates for the contest were also announced, with the first semi-final being held on 7 February, leading up to the final on 14 March 2009 over six weeks. 
After two years of hosting the contest, it was announced that Kristian Luuk would not be hosting the 2009 edition of Melodifestivalen. He was replaced by comedian Petra Mede, who was announced at the new host in a press conference by SVT on 18 December.
Visual design.
The logo for the Contest, the now-familiar five spotlights, has not been altered since its interception in 2002, and remained in use for the 2009 Contest. The first details of the stage for this year's contest were released on 29 January 2009, a week before the first semi-final in Gothenburg. The first plans of the stage were made during the summer of 2008 and was, for the third time, designed by Viktor Brattström, with the intention to provide a feeling of endlessness: "The audience will get the feeling of not knowing where the stage starts or ends, not knowing what's coming up around the corner".
The green room, where the artists rested after their performances, was altered from previous contests. Instead of competing artists and composers sitting together at tables, artists sat together on sofas beside the stage, while composers sat together in the front rows of the audience.
Entries.
A record-breaking 3,440 songs were submitted to the competition, with only 28 proceeding to the next round. The final 28 songs chosen to compete in the semi-finals were released by SVT on 14 October, along with the names of their authors. The names of the performers were held back, and were released in groups over the following weeks. However this did not stop speculation on who would perform certain songs in the semi-final.
The first eight participants were revealed on 18 November 2009: they included former participants Alcazar, BWO, Måns Zelmerlöw, Lasse Lindh, Caroline af Ugglas and Sarah Dawn Finer, as well as debuting artists Emilia and Jennifer Brown.
On 23 November, the tenth act was revealed by Melodifestivalen producer Christer Björkman on the reality TV show "Dansbandkampen". The Scotts, a participant on the show, was revealed to have been selected to compete in Melodifestivalen 2009 with "Jag tror på oss". SVT followed by releasing the next group of competing artists, all of whom had never competed in Melodifestivalen before: H.E.A.T, Jonathan Fagerlund, Maja Gullstrand, Mikael Rickfors, Molly Sandén, Next 3, and Rigo & The Topaz Sound feat. Red Fox were all announced to have been successful in their applying for Melodifestivalen.
Six more artists were revealed on 2 December by SVT's "Culture News" – Idol winner Agnes was announced to be making her debut to Melodifestivalen after being disqualified in 2007. The remaining artists announced were all making their returns to Melodifestivalen, including Shirley Clamp, Lili & Susie, Amy Diamond, Sofia and Velvet.
A day before the next group of artists were released by SVT it had been rumoured that two former Eurovision participants would compete in a duet – Estonia's 2002 participant Sahlene, and Norway's 2008 participant, and current host of Norway's equivalent of Melodifestivalen, Melodi Grand Prix, Maria Haukaas Storeng. The following day, on 9 December, SVT confirmed the news, and also announced the names of four more artists: Susanne Alfvengren, the Thorleifs, Nina Söderquist and Cookies 'n Beans.
The final non-wild card entry to be announced was revealed on 16 December, with the Star Pilots performing "Higher" in the contest.
Wild cards.
The wild card ("joker") system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured in the competition. Four artists, one in each semifinal, are invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules.
In a change from previous years, the names of the wild card entries were released alongside the submitted entries instead of the usual method of releasing the wild cards after the other 28 entries. The first wild card entry was released on 19 November, with Melodifestivalen producer Christer Björkman, Jennifer Brown and Måns Zelmerlöw featuring on "Godmorgon Sverige". They revealed that Finnish-Swedish singer Markoolio would enter Melodifestivalen with the song "Kärlekssång från mig".
The second wild card entry was announced on 26 November by SVT – opera singer Malena Ernman was confirmed to be participating in this year's contest with "La voix", composed by herself and Fredrik Kempe, who also composed last year's winning entry "Hero". The third wild card was announced on 3 December, with Marie Serneholt, formerly of A*Teens, taking part with "Disconnect Me", written by Peter Boström and Tony Nilsson.
The final wild card entry was revealed on 16 December – boyband E.M.D., consisting of Erik Segerstedt, Mattias Andréasson and Danny Saucedo (all of them former Idol competitors) were announced as the last competitor, performing "Baby Goodbye", written by the band members and Oscar Görres.
Wild card entries
Semi-finals.
Each of the 32 songs were sorted into one semi-final on 11 December, with 8 songs each competing in a semi-final (including one wild card). However the final running order for the semi-final was conducted on 15 January – Nina Söderquist would open the first semi-final with "Tick Tock", while wild card Malena Ernman would close the final semi-final with "La voix".
The four semi-finals were held between 7 and 28 February, with the Second Chance round being held on 7 March.
Semi-final 1.
The first semi-final was held on 7 February at the Scandinavium in Gothenburg.
The show began with host Petra Mede introducing the eight competing acts, with a number of skits being shown with former winners Charlotte Perrelli and Martin Stenmarck.
The first song on stage was Nina Söderquist with "Tick Tock", a powerful rock song. Söderquist performed in a black leather outfit, joined by four male backing dancers and two male backing singers, all in black. Fire was used frequently during the performance. Second on stage was Jonathan Fagerlund, performing "Welcome To My Life". Fagerlund, dressed in a grey top and jeans, was joined on stage by an all-female backing band for his performance of the light pop/rock song. Next on stage was Melodifestivalen 2004 runner-up Shirley Clamp, performing the first Swedish language song of the contest, "Med hjärtat fyllt av ljus" (With my heart full of light). Clamp performed the ballad alone on stage, dressed in a long blue dress. The stage was also bathed in blue light, and wind machines were later used in the performance. The fourth act on stage was dansband the Scotts, performing "Jag tror på oss" (I believe in us). The quartet, performing in black and silver suits, were joined by three female backing singers, dressed in short black dresses.
The fifth act on stage was Emilia, singing "You're My World", an up-tempo pop song with jazz elements. Emilia was dressed in a sparkling gold dress, joined on stage by four female backing singers, a pianist, drummer and bassist, all dressed in Big band era inspired outfits. Pyrotechnics were later used towards the end of the song. Next on stage was twice third-placers Alcazar, composed of Andreas Lundstedt, Tess Merkel and Lina Hedlund. Their song "Stay the Night", a energetic disco song, began with violet light shining on the band members, dressed in pink and blue. The group were joined by three backing dancers, with dancing featured throughout the song by the trio. The penultimate song was Caroline af Ugglas with "Snälla snälla" (Please, please), an emotional ballad. Caroline, dressed in a short white dress with bright blue wellies, gave an emotional performance, with anger and frustration prominent. Last on stage was the semi-finals wild card entry, Marie Serneholt with "Disconnect Me". Serneholt performed the energetic pop song in a short white dress, joined by four male dancers, and later by two female backing singers, all in black.
After the first round of televoting was conducted Marie Serneholt, Jonathan Fagerlund and Shirley Clamp were all eliminated from the competition after receiving the fewest votes. They were joined by Nina Söderquist, after she received the fewest votes in the second round of voting. All of the remaining four acts progressed to the duels.
In the duels Alcazar battled against the Scotts for a place in the final, with Alcazar getting more votes against the dansband. Caroline af Ugglas and Emilia also battled for direct qualification, with Emilia winning the place in the final.
A total of 3,294,000 watched the semi-final on SVT, with 721,334 votes cast during the semi-final, a record for the first semi-final of Melodifestivalen. Because of this, 1,396,108kr was donated to SVT's charity appeal "Radiohjälpen".
Semi-final 2.
The second semi-final was held at the Skellefteå Kraft Arena in Skellefteå on 14 February.
The first act on stage was sisters Lili & Susie with "Show Me Heaven". The sisters performed the energetic pop song in white top and black trousers, and were joined on stage by a group of backing dancers/singers, all in black. Large white letters spelt out the title of the song on the backing LED screens, and pyrotechnics were used at the end of the song. Second on stage was Lasse Lindh och Bandet, performing "Jag ska slåss i dina kvarter!" (I'll be fighting in your neighbourhood!). Lindh performed the rock song with a backing band and a male backing singer in black. Next on stage was Jennifer Brown with "Never Been Here Before", an emotional pop/rock song.

In total 939,222 votes were cast for the Second Chance round.
International Jury.
The international jury had the task of selecting a song from each heat which they think was the most suitable for the Eurovision Song Contest. The jury were only able to pick songs that had not passed to the final. If they pick a song which qualifies to the final through the Second Chance round, that song became ineligible for the jury's choice. The international jury were also given the right to vote during the final of the contest, becoming the 12th jury, alongside the 11 regional juries.
The first song to receive the international jury wildcard was Caroline af Ugglas, who passed to Second Chance from the Gothenburg heat on 7 February with "Snälla, snälla". Amy Diamond was the second qualifier, however, shortly after the show it was rumoured that the announcement of Diamond as the jury choice was incorrect, and that the true choice was Jennifer Brown, who had placed 7th in the televote. This rumour however was revealed to be false by SVT, with Diamond as the correct choice.
The Leksand wildcard selected was Sofia with "Alla". This song was the only jury wilcard selected that failed to qualify to Second Chance, coming 7th in the televote. The final wildcard, coming from the Malmö qualifier, was Sarah Dawn Finer with "Moving On", another Second Chance qualifier.
As Sarah Dawn Finer and Caroline af Ugglas had qualified from the Second Chance round to the final this made them ineligible to be chosen for the international jury qualifier. This left two songs left to compete for the 11th final place: either Amy Diamond, who had already been knocked out of Second Chance in the first round, or Sofia. The final choice by the jury was for Sofia with "Alla".
Members of the International Jury.
The following people were members of the international jury:
Final.
The final of Melodifestivalen 2009 was held at the Globen arena in Stockholm on 14 March 2009.

The favourites to win the contest were Zelmerlöw and Ernman, with the international jury wild card Sofia predicted as most likely to finish last, according to bookmakers.
Måns Zelmerlöw took the stage first on the night, repeating his performance from the semi-final of "Hope & Glory". Second Chance qualifier Caroline af Ugglas followed Zelmerlöw on stage with "Snälla snälla", repeating her emotional performance alone on stage. Agnes was next on stage, performing "Love Love Love", now with a new hairstyle, but no major changes were made to the performance since the semi-final. H.E.A.T followed with their rock song "1000 Miles", who were then followed by Emilia with "You're My World".

Boyband E.M.D., now performing in white tuxedos, were eighth on stage with "Baby Goodbye". International jury selection Sofia followed on stage, singing the Greek ethno number "Alla". She was followed by 16-year-old Molly Sandén with "Så vill stjärnorna", and finally by Malena Ernman with "La voix".
At the final vote Malena Ernman was the winner: despite only coming 8th in the jury vote, she was able to win the televote and guarantee victory with "La voix". The runner-up was Caroline af Ugglas with "Snälla snälla", while E.M.D. came third with "Baby Goodbye". The winner of the jury vote was Måns Zelmerlöw with "Hope & Glory".
1,748,970 votes were received during the final, with a total of 3,457,434.50kr being donated to SVT's "Radiohjälpen" appeal. 3,592,000 people watched the final on SVT, however over 10 million watched the show live on SVT's online video on demand service SVT Play.
Voting.
The voting in the final was made up of both televoting/SMS voting and jury voting. 12 juries – 11 regional juries from around Sweden, along with the international jury – gave 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points to their favourite songs. This was joined by televoting, with the total number of votes being converted into a set amount of points – 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 points were given to the most-popular songs of the total televote from around Sweden.
The International jury results were announced immediately after all the entries were performed, while the televoting was still taking place. These results were announced on stage by Eurovision Song Contest 2007 winner and International Jury member Marija Šerifović.
Måns Zelmerlöw was the favourite with the juries, receiving a total of 96 points. Sarah Dawn Finer came second with the juries, gaining 75 points, while Alcazar came third with 67. However the televoting completely contradicted this, with the televoting favourite Malena Ernman coming only eighth in the jury vote, while runner-up Caroline af Ugglas came only 5th in the jury.

1994 Recopa Sudamericana

The 1994 Recopa Sudamericana was the 6th Recopa Sudamericana, an annual football match between the winners of the previous season's Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana competitions. This year's edition pitted the defending champions São Paulo against compatriots Botafogo in a second, consecutive all-Brazilian final. Since São Paulo won both the 1993 Copa Libertadores and 1993 Supercopa Sudamericana, CONMEBOL invited Botafogo, winners of the 1993 Copa CONMEBOL, to participate in order to make this year's "Recopa" doable. 
São Paulo successfully defends the trophy as they defeated Botafogo 3-1 in Kobe Universiade Memorial Stadium of Kobe to become the first ever team to win consecutive titles. Juan Escobar Valdez became the first referee to direct two finals of the competition (having already done so in 1992).

G. S. Khaparde

Ganesh Srikrishna Khaparde (27 August 1854 – 1 July 1938) was a renowned Indian lawyer, scholar, political activist and a noted devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba and saint Gajanan Maharaj.
Born at Ingroli in Berar, Khaparde studied Sanskrit and English Literature before beginning law. He graduated with an LLB in 1884, which led him to Government service. He served as a Munsiff and an assistant commissioner at Berar between 1885 to 1890. Closely associated with Bal Gangadhar Tilak, he took a keen interest in politics and in 1890 resigned from service to begin his own law practice at Amrawati. Khaparde was the chairman of the reception committee at the Amarawati Congress in 1897. He attended, along with Tilak, the Shivaji Festival of the Congress at Calcutta in 1906. He was at this time associated with the "extremist" camp within the Congress, led by Lal-Bal-Pal trio of Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal. A close ally and one of the most trusted lieutanants of Tilak, Khaparde's strong and singular personal influence in the Central Provinces earned him the epitaph of "the Nawab of Berar". Between 1908 and 1910, Khaparde travelled to England to conduct Tilak's appeal to the Privy Council. Intelligence reports indicate that along with Bipin Chandra Pal, he was at this time associated with the India House.
Later, Khaparde was a founding member of Tilak's Indian Home Rule League in 1916, and was a member of the Congress's deputation to the Viceroy on constitutional reforms. Between May 1919 and January 1920, Khaparde was in England again as a delegate of the Home Rule League's deputation to the Joint Parliamentary committee. During his stay of seven months he made speeches in England. He become popular by way of his wit, humour and mannerisum and hence some news-paper described him as "Mark Twain". 
Following the inauguration of Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, he was selected a member of the Imperial Legislative Council. However, in 1920, Khaparde left the Congress anticipating Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement. Between 1920 and 1925, Khaparde elected a member of the Central Legislative Assembly. 
As noted in Shree Gajanan Vijay, he was devotee of Gajanan Maharaj of Shegaon. Many reference texts of his are available in the epic.
G.S. Khaparde was also a noted devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba. His first interaction with Sri Sai Baba was in December 1910 when he sought refuge at Shirdi escaping the incarceration and purge of political dissidents in India at the time. Between 1910 and 1918, his "Shirdi diary" recording visits to Sai Baba shed much light on Baba's life, his routine, and his work.
G.S. Khaparde died on 1 July 1938. He was survived by his son Balkrishna Ganesh Khaparde, also a lawyer and leader.

Icosahedral prism

In geometry, an icosahedral prism is a convex uniform polychoron (four-dimensional polytope). This polychoron has 22 polyhedral cells: 2 icosahedra connected by 20 triangular prisms. It has 70 faces: 30 squares and 40 triangles. It has 72 edges and 24 vertices.
It can be constructed by creating two coinciding icosahedra in 3-space, and translating each copy in opposite perpendicular directions in 4-space until their separation equals their edge length.

Cimon della Pala

Cimon della Pala, sometimes called Cimone and The Matterhorn of the Dolomites ("il Cervino delle Dolomiti"), is the best-known peak of the Pale di San Martino group, in the Dolomites, northern Italy. Although it is not the highest peak of the group, the Cima Vezzana being a few metres higher, its slender point, which can be seen from the Rolle Pass, dominates the landscape.
Location.
The mountain lies near the town of Tonadico in Trentino, the southern part of the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, and is the watershed between the Cismón valley and the Travignolo valley. It is the northernmost peak in the chain of the Pale di San Martino and is flanked by the Vezzana. Between the high, steep walls of the two peaks and descending to the north, lies a steep glacier called Travignolo, which is the source of a river of the same name, a tributary of the Avisio.
Route.
The peak can be attained by a route which, while easy, requires good experience, called the "Variation for the Summit". This departs from a bivouac shelter called Fiamme Gialle, at a height of 3,005 metres, which is reached by the Bolver-Lugli "via ferrata", not technically demanding, but tiring. This mountain route, equipped with fixed cables, stemples, ladders, and bridges, was constructed by a group of mountain guides from San Martino di Castrozza, known in the mountaineering world as the Eagles of San Martino, to mark the centenary in 1970 of the first ascent of the peak on 3 June 1870 by Edward Robson Whitwell and his guides Santo Siorpaes, of nearby Cortina d'Ampezzo, and Christian Lauener of Lauterbrunnen.
A good access to the "via ferrata" is by way of the gondola lift from San Martino di Castrozza to Colverde, which operates between the middle of June and the end of September .
History.
The mountain brought the first tourists into the Primiero valley. In 1862, British travellers Josiah Gilbert and George Cheetham Churchill saw a picture of the Cimon della Pala in an inn. Fascinated by it, they wanted to see it at first hand, and wrote of it in their account "The Dolomite Mountains: Excursions Through Tyrol, Carinthia, Carniola & Friuli" (London, 1864). In later years there was an influx of tourists, at first mostly from outside Italy, who were interested in the whole chain of the Pale.
The mountain can be seen on the coat of arms ("pictured") of the Guardia di Finanza, an Italian law enforcement agency which is one of the Italian Armed Forces and which has its Alpine School not far from the Cimon della Pala.
