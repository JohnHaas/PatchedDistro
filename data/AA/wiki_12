Prince Sabahaddin

Prince Sabahaddin of Thrace (born as Sultanzade Mehmed Sabâhaddin Beyefendi Hazretleri; 13 February 1879, İstanbul—30 June 1948, Neuchâtel, Switzerland) was an Ottoman sociologist and thinker. Because of his threat to the Ottoman dynasty due his political activity and attitude, he was expelled.
Prince Sabahaddin was a person full of surprises. He was connected to the Ottoman Palace through his mother, but was known as a Young Turk standing in opposition to that regime. Allegations of his close affinity to the ambassador of England could not be proven. As a follower of Émile Durkheim, Prens Sabahaddin is considered to be one of the founders of sociology in Turkey. He established the Private Enterprise and Decentralization Association (Teşebbüsü Şahsî ve Ademi Merkeziyet Cemiyeti in Turkish) in 1906.
Biography.
Prens Sabahaddin was born in Istanbul in 1879. His mother was Seniha Sultan, daughter of Ottoman Padisah Abdülmecit I, and Nalan î Dil Kadın Efendi. His Father was Mahmud Celaleddin Paşa, the son of Kaptan ı Derya Gürcü Halil Rifat Paşa.
Prince Sabahaddin, nephew of the Sultan Murad V, Abdul Hamid II, Mehmed V, and the last Sultan Mehmed VI, had a versatile education at the Ottoman palace and is considered the founding father of Ottoman liberalism.
Sabahaddin fled in late 1899 with his brother and father, who had fallen out with Abdul Hamid II, first to Great Britain, then to Geneva, the center of opposition to the Ottoman Sultan. After a warning by the Federal Council in Geneva in 1900, they left and went to Paris and London. Sabahaddin advocated revolutionary violence and led the opposition in exile.
During the first phase of his career in political opposition (1900-1908) he sought unity between Christians and Muslims met with Muslim and Christian leaders. He received support in the cause of the Young Turks. In this time he met Edmond Demolins and became a follower of the school of social sciences. Sabahaddin advocated liberal economic policies in his Teşebbüs-ü Şahsi ve Adem-i Merkeziyet, which became a rival to Ahmed Rıza’s Committee for Union and Progress. This division plagued the Young Turk movement before 1908 and would provide the central dispute in the more institutionalized political discourse of the Second constitutional era. After the Young Turk revolution and the seizure of power by the Committee of Union and Progress in 1908 he returned to the Ottoman Empire.
His Liberal Party was banned in 1909 and 1913 he had to flee again. The first World War I, he spent as head of the enemy in western Switzerland.
In 1919 Sabahaddin returned in the belief back to realize his political vision, to Istanbul, but was ultimately banned in 1924 by the victorious Nationalists under Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk). His project of a democratic Turkey contained means of decentralization and private initiative, elements of the social theories of Frederic Le Play and Edmond Demolins. In 1924, after the establishment of the new Republic of Turkey, he was exiled out of Turkey by law which expelled all the living members of the Ottoman Dynasty on March 3rd 1924 and thus, from 1924, Sabahaddin had to live in retirement in Switzerland. In his autobiography "The Witness" (1962, first edition; 1974, revised and enlargened second edition), John G. Bennett notes that in his later years he had become an alcoholic because of his frustrations, disappointments, and exile out of Turkey and had died in great poverty and oblivion.
He died in 1948, his body was kept in a metal coffin for four years in Switzerland.
In 1952, Prince Sabahaddin's remains were transferred to Istanbul, Turkey and buried in the mausoleum of his father and grandfather.
Offspring and descendants.
From his first marriage, with Tabinak Kadin Efendi, he had a daughter, Fethiye Sabahaddin Kendi (1899 – 1986) unmarried and without issue. Prince Sabâhaddin's second Wife was Prenses Kâmûran,the younger sister of his first Wife Tabinak.
Religion.
Sabahaddin, his brother and father were supporters of Mu'tazilism. The Mu'tazili, المعتزلة Arabic, Al-Mu'tazila DMG (also Mu'tazilite), is within the Islamic Kalam theology of a rationalist-oriented school in the 8th to 9th century was the most influential.
Influences on other people.
Sabahaddin had, unknowingly, influenced many people including John G. Bennett who was introduced to him by Satvet Lutfi Bey (Satvet Lütfi Tozan) in Istanbul during 1920 while working as an intelligence officer for the British Army which were among the occupying forces of Istanbul after the First World War. Sabahaddin introduced Bennett into the world of spirituality by borrowing, among others, the book and encouraging him to read "Les Grands Initiés" ("The Great Initiates") by Édouard Schuré. He had also introduced to Bennett an English woman living in Turkey, Winifred "Polly" Beaumont, to whom Bennett had married. Among the others Sabahaddin had introduced to Bennett, the most influential was doubtlessly G.I. Gurdjieff - Bennett has assumed him as his mentor and his master for the rest of his life.

Sleuth (video game)

Sleuth is a text-based "whodunit" computer-game created by Eric N. Miller of Norland Software. It was first released in 1983.
When the game starts, a murder has just been committed. The object of the game is to solve the murder mystery by examining the house and talking to its occupants. Being a text-based game, the graphics are rather simple and consist of ASCII characters. The user can move the character using the arrow keys, and interact with persons and objects by issuing commands (from a fairly limited vocabulary list) at the game's prompt (similar to Sierra's "Quest" games). To win the game, the player must accurately identify the murder weapon, murder location, and the murderer. The player can do this by examining different objects in the game, talking to the occupants and observing their behavior. The murderer is the one whose alibi contradicts everyone else's.
The game is made challenging by the fact that the player has to keep track of everyone's stories and also can only question people once or twice before the murderer becomes suspicious. If the player takes too long to solve the mystery, the murderer will eventually kill the player's character and the game ends. The game has two modes: a "Basic" mode and a "Personalized" mode. The only difference between the two modes is in the naming of in-game characters. In "Basic" mode, the game randomly generates the name of the characters, whereas in "Personalized" mode, the player can supply the names of the characters. Although the game is simple, no two murder scenarios are exactly alike as the game randomizes attributes of the game like the victim, murder scene, murder weapon, and murderer.
The game can be run on Mac with the use of the freeware program "boxer", and has been cloned in Javascript, enabling users to play it in an internet browser.

The Uhrenmuseum Beyer (Beyer Watch and Clock Museum) is located in the heart of the city of Zürich, Switzerland and is one of the world's leading private museums dedicated to the horology. 
The museum is located on the lower level of Bahnhofstrasse 31, the main shopping boulevard. It is affiliated with Chronometrie Beyer, a high grade watch retailer run by the same family for generations. 
The core of the museum was acquired during the life of Theodore 'Teddy' Beyer, a pioneer in collecting antique timekeepers. The collection is made up of premechanical timekeepers (sundials, sandglasses, water and fire clocks) as well as clocks and watches from around the world and covering all eras.
The collection is particularly strong regarding early clocks and watches, including several pieces from the gothic and renaissance era, as well as complicated pieces with many complications.
Many of the displayed pieces are unique and/or significant in the history of watchmaking, and therefore are often loaned out to major museums around the world. The collection includes one of the early marine chronometers by Ferdinand Berthoud, a pendule sympathique by Breguet, a pocket watch with astronomical indications by Auch, several bespoke late 20th century watches by George Daniels, one of the few reproductions of the astrarium by De Dondi to name just a few highlights. Furthermore there are superb Geneva made enameled pocket watches, and a most instructive timeline illustrating the history of the Neuchâtel pendule.
Additionally there is a good small display of locally made clocks and watches including such Zurich makers as Bachoffner, Liechti and Ochsner.

Northern Co-operative Society

Northern Co-operative Society Limited (abbreviated to Norco), previously named Northern Co-operative Company Limited, was a local consumer co-operative trading in Aberdeen, Scotland, from 1861 to 1993.
It operated supermarkets and other businesses throughout Aberdeenshire, and employed 2000 people in 1992.
It was put into the hands of a receiver for liquidation in 1993, as a result of financial difficulties that "The Guardian" newspaper attributed to “an over-ambitious building and development programme” and failed attempts to dispose of the entire business as a going concern, despite the successful sale of its dairy, five pharmacies, and then several supermarkets to Argyll Stores and the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS).
History.
Norco was formed in 1861 as Northern Co-operative Company, by two committees of Aberdeen residents who planned to follow the example of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society. 
The first shop was a grocery business at 51 Gallowgate, opened in July that year. The original company had a fixed capital of £1000, but in 1917, it converted into Northern Co-operative Society.
The Society's headquarters were in a large building on Loch Street, which contained the company's offices as well as an arcade-style shopping area. It was described in 2000 as “like Convent Garden "(sic)" – a delightful, quaint area at the centre of the city where people could stroll” by Connie Leith, head of the Ferryhill Heritage Society.
Norco House, a large department store which replaced the Loch Street building, was opened in George Street in 1970, less than 100 feet from the original building. 
The trading name of Norco was soon adopted by the entire co-operative.
The “space-age” four storey Norco House department store was later bought, refurbished and operated by the John Lewis employee-owned chain.
The old Loch Street building remained empty and slowly deteriorated until its eventual demolition in 1986.
In 1977, Norco opened a flagship superstore in the Berryden district of Aberdeen.
The Berryden store was sold to the Scottish Co-op in 1993 immediately before the receivership, and operated by that co-operative for seven years.
In April 1992, Norco declared a loss of £7 million, and the chief executive, Robin Pollock, resigned.
Emergency measures included a massive sell-off of businesses, and a pay freeze.
Kennerty Dairies (since bought by Robert Wiseman Dairies) bought Norco's Berryden dairy, and Argyll Group bought supermarkets in Banchory, Elgin, Ellon and Westhill.
Finally, in 1993, Norco approached Scottish Co-op with a view to a rescue merger, but the latter organization declined the request.
Operations and co-operative movement.
Norco was previously noted as the only large consumer co-operative in the UK not to be a member of the Scottish or English Co-operative Wholesale Societies.
It employed 2000 people in 1992, when the financial problems became apparent, and on going into receivership in June 1993, it had 800 employees.
Its trading area included the Aberdeenshire and Moray towns of Banchory, Elgin, Ellon, Kemnay, Inverurie, Port Elphinstone and Westhill. 
At its peak it had branches and departments throughout the city of Aberdeen.
Since the demise of Norco, the tradition of consumer co-operation in Aberdeenshire has been continued or revived by three southern organizations: Scotmid Co-operative, Lothian, Borders & Angus Co-operative and Scottish Co-op (a retail division of CWS, now the Co-operative Group.)

It is compounded of the words "cova" (cave), "ruber" (red) and the suffix "ia" (that has the quality of), meaning "the cave that is red" or simply "red cave".
Coat of arms.
The familiar coat of arms of this surname was described in 1592 by A. Sales, accordingly to the "Book of Armoria". This description is for a coat of arms of a Covarrubias family that, in two generations, was to live from the village of Covarrubias to the village of Cocentaina (Province of Alicante, Spain). In fact, the possible first user of this coat of arms was Mr. Diego de Covarrubias Sanz, born in Cocentaina, who in 1590 had to report his family tree in order to be joined to the Spanish Inquisition. The grandfather of Diego, "Hernando de Cobarrubias", was born in the village of Covarrubias. Therefore, Mr. Diego, who used this coat of arms, was the first Covarrubias born in Cocentaina, and his coat of arms can be used by his progeny.
In accordance with the "Book of Armoria", the coat of arms of this branch of the Covarrubias settled in Cocentaina consists in a quartered Spanish shield, of the following characteristics and tinctures:

Isan people

Isan people (, , ; , also known as "Tai Isan" or "Lao Isan") are an ethnic group native to Northeastern Thailand ("Isan") with a population of 22 millions. Like Thai and Lao people, they belong to the family of Tai peoples. 
Their language (Isan language) and culture have Lao roots and are therefore closer to those of Laos than to the Central Thai ones. The reasons to consider Isan a separate ethnicity, and not part of the Lao, are rather historical and social ones. Nevertheless, Isan people are normally Thai nationals and, due to the policy of Thaification, increasingly oriented toward Central Thailand and its dominant culture. Thailand does not recognize Isan as a distinct ethnicity, but considers all Tai peoples living in Thailand as one (Thai) people. Thai policy has successfully sought to downplay the Lao kinship of Isan people and instead led to the development of a distinct regional Isan identity. Still, 88% of Isan people always speak Isan language when at home, 11% speak both Isan and Central Thai and only 1% speak Central Thai exclusively. 
Many Isan people have migrated to the Bangkok agglomeration for work. About 8,000 Isan people live in Laos, on the eastern bank of the Mekong river which forms the border to Thailand. Others have emigrated to Malaysia, Singapore and several western countries.

Michael Joseph "Joe" Conroy (September 20, 1874September 5, 1946) was the second Mayor of Anchorage, Alaska, serving from 1923 to 1924.
Biography.
Michael Joseph Conroy was born in the village of Ballyconneely, County Galway, Ireland, on September 20, 1874. His family emigrated to the United States in 1880, settling in Manchester, New Hampshire. He worked for the Boston and Maine Railroad until 1904. In 1905, he moved to Seward, Alaska to work on the Alaska Central Railroad. He lived for a time in Cordova, Knik and Valdez, where in 1913 he was admitted to the Alaska Bar Association. He served as United States Commissioner in the Seward-Kenai precinct until 1916. During this time he met and married Nellie Rushton Muscott, a nurse from Simpson, Kansas who was working in Seward for Dr. Joseph H. Romig. In June 1916, the couple moved to Anchorage where Joe found work as a tax assessor for the not-yet incorporated city.
Conroy was elected mayor in 1923, and reelected in 1924. During Conroy's first term in office, President Warren Harding visited Alaska, becoming the first U.S. President to visit the territory. Harding, along with Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and others, arrived in Anchorage on the train from Seward on July 13, 1923 at 9:30 in the evening. Conroy welcomed them in a ceremony on Fourth Avenue, presenting Harding with a Sydney Laurence oil painting of Mount McKinley.
Conroy resigned on October 2, 1924, with City Council member Charles Bush appointed to complete the rest of his term.
Conroy died on September 5, 1946. He is buried in Anchorage Memorial Park Cemetery.

Confused flour beetle

The confused flour beetle ("Tribolium confusum"), a type of darkling beetle known as a flour beetle, is a common pest insect known for attacking and infesting stored flour and grain. They are one of the most common and most destructive insect pests for grain and other food products stored in silos, warehouses, grocery stores, and homes.
Appearance.
The confused flour beetle is very similar in appearance and habit to the red flour beetle, "Tribolium castaneum" and the destructive flour beetle, "Tribolium destructor". Both the confused flour beetle and red flour beetle are small, about 1/8 to 1/4 inch in length, and reddish-brown in color. The primary distinguishing physical difference is the shape of their antennae: the confused flour beetle's antennae increase gradually in size and have four clubs, while the red flour beetle's antennae have only three. Additionally, red flour beetles have been known to fly short distances, while confused flour beetles do not. "Tribolium destructor" is much darker than either and less common.
The "confused" in the beetle's name is due to being confused with the red flour beetle, and not because of its walking pattern.
Habits.
While confused (and red) flour beetles cannot feed on whole, undamaged grain, they are often found in large numbers in infested grains, feeding on broken grain, grain dust, and other household food items such as flour, rice, dried fruit, nuts, and beans. Both types of beetles are often found not only in infested grains, but in crevices in pantries and cabinet, as well. Damage to food is caused somewhat by the beetles' feeding, but also by their dead bodies, fecal pellets, and foul-smelling secretions. In addition to creating a foul odor, the beetles' presence encourages the growth of mold.
In science and popular culture.
Confused flour beetles are a common model organism in science. Several confused flour beetles were experimental subjects on the Bion 1 spacecraft, launched in 1973.
In an episode of "Mythbusters", the flour beetle, as well as cockroaches and fruit flies, were tested to determine their resistance to radiation in the event of a nuclear holocaust. In the end, the flour beetle was the only species tested to live 30 days past exposure to 100,000 rads (100 times the lethal dose to human beings, according to promotions of the episode).

Lower Pond (Kaliningrad)

The Lower Pond () is a large artificial pond in northern Kaliningrad, Russia. It was known as the Schlossteich while part of Königsberg, Germany, until 1945.
The pond is about one kilometre long, north to south. Along its length, its width varies between about 50 and 100 metres. The source of the water is from the north. The water eventually drains underground down to the river Pregel to the south. During the winter months, the pond can freeze over.
History.
The pond, first documented by the Teutonic Knights in 1256, was created by damming the Katzbach stream which led to the Pregel. Mills constructed nearby caused the pond to be known as the Mühlenteich (mill pond). The Teutonic Knights' infirmary was constructed along the southwestern edge of the pond, while the Magdalenenkloster (Magdalene monastery) was built on the southern shore. A second pond, the Oberteich or Upper Pond, was created north of the first pond in 1270.
By the time of the Duchy of Prussia's creation in 1525, the pond was known as the Schlossteich, named after nearby Königsberg Castle (Schloss). The Schlossteich was surrounded by Burgfreiheit along the southern shore, Tragheim to the west, the Oberteich to the north, and Rossgarten to the east. Regent George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, had a pair of swans relocated to the pond in 1604, but they were considered a nuisance by the burghers. A crossing between Tragheim and the Burgkirche was laid out in 1717, while the Schlossteichbrücke bridge was completed in 1753. During a visit to Königsberg by King William I in 1869, part of the bridge collapsed due to the multitude of people on it, with 32 drowning.
The residents of Königsberg gradually came to appreciate the beauty of the pond close to the Königsgarten, with many nobles building palaces near the waterfront. Holstein-Beck constructed his palace, later developed into the Kommandantur Königsberg, in 1693, while the merchant Hevelke built his summer house nearby in 1750. The palace of Count Gebhard Johann von Keyserling was later turned into the Generalkommando. Königsberg's Masonic Lodges were located in Hintertragheim near the Schlossteich and included Zum Todtenkopfe und Phoenix, the Dreikronenloge, and the Johannisloge Immanuel. King Frederick William III of Prussia granted the pond to the city in 1810.
Numerous recreational establishments were built along the Schlossteich from 1830-70, including the Borckscher Garten, Jacobsruh, Tivoli, Jardin de Berlin, the Börsengarten, and the Bürgerressource. The 300th anniversary of the founding of the Albertina, the University of Königsberg, was celebrated along the Schlossteich in 1844. The swampy northern corner near Hinterroßgarten was filled in 1881. The Städtische Krankenhaus was a hospital built along the northeastern Schlossteich in 1895.
The scenic promenade was a favourite recreational area for the people of Königsberg, especially students. The promenade extended in the southwest from Münzplatz until the Schlossteichbrücke by 1906, while the southeastern stretch reached the Stadthalle in 1911. The northeastern extension of the Promenade with cascading waterfalls was finished by 1930, while the northwestern stretch was completed in 1937 after the expropriation of the Masonic Lodges.
The Schlossteich was surrounded by cafés and was central to many important buildings and places, including Königsberg Castle to the southwest, the new campus of the Albertina to the west, and Münzplatz at the southern end of the pond. Concerts were performed at the Börsengarten and the Stadthalle. Along the western side of the Schlossteich was a statue called "Der Bogenschütze" or "Der Bogenspanner" (The Archer) by Heinemann, while along the eastern side were the Burgkirche and the Bellevue hotel and restaurant. Gondolas were frequently used in the pond, and on Walpurgis Night members of the German Student Corps would travel in paper lantern-decorated boats. During winter the Schlossteich was used for ice skating. In 1919 the pond contained 22 white swans and two black swans. 
The pond was transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union following World War II in 1945. Most of the surrounding German-era construction was destroyed during the 1944 Bombing of Königsberg and 1945 Battle of Königsberg.

<doc id="18272082" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18272082" title="Residuated mapping">
Residuated mapping

In mathematics, the concept of a residuated mapping arises in the theory of partially ordered sets. It refines the concept of a monotone function.
If "A", "B" are posets, a function "f": "A" → "B" is defined to be monotone if and only if it is order-preserving: that is, "x" ≤ "y" implies "f"("x") ≤ "f"("y"). This is equivalent to the condition that the preimage under "f" of every down-set of "B" is a down-set of "A". We define a principal down-set to be one of the form ↓{"b"} = { "b"' ∈ "B" : "b"' ≤ "b" }. In general the preimage of a principal down-set need not be a principal down-set.
The notion of residuated map can be generalized to a binary operator (or any higher arity) via component-wise residuation. This approach gives rise to notions of left and right division in a partially ordered magma, additionally endowing it with a quasigroup structure. (One speaks only of residuated algebra for higher arities). A binary (or higher arity) residuated map is usually "not" residuated as a unary map.
Definition.
If "A", "B" are posets, a function "f": "A" → "B" is residuated if and only if the preimage under "f" of every principal down-set of "B" is a principal down-set of "A".
Consequences.
With "A", "B" posets, the set of functions "A" → "B" can be ordered by the pointwise order "f" ≤ "g" ↔ (∀"x" ∈ A) "f"("x") ≤ "g"("x").
It can be shown that "f" is residuated if and only if there exists a (necessarily unique) monotone function "f" +: "B" → "A" such that "f" o "f" + ≤ idB and "f" + o "f" ≥ idA, where id is the identity function. The function "f" + is the residual of "f". A residuated function and its residual form a Galois connection under the (more recent) monotone definition of that concept, and for every (monotone) Galois connection the lower adjoints is residuated with the residual being the upper adjoint. Therefore, the notions of monotone Galois connection and residuated mapping essentially coincide.
Additionally, we have "f" -1(↓{"b"}) = ↓{"f" +("b")}. 
If "B"° denotes the order dual (opposite poset) to "B" then "f" : "A" → "B" is a residuated mapping if and only if "f" : "A" → "B"° and "f" *: "B"° → "A" form a Galois connection under the original antitone definition of this notion.
If "f" : "A" → "B" and "g" : "B" → "C" are residuated mappings, then so is the function composition "fg" : "A" → "C", with residual ("fg") + = "g" +"f" +. The antitone Galois connections do not share this property.
The set of monotone transformations (functions) over a poset is an ordered monoid with the pointwise order, and so is the set of residuated transformations.
Residuated binary operators.
If • : "P" × "Q" → "R" is a binary map and "P", "Q", and "R" are posets, then one may define residuation component-wise for the left and right translations, i.e. multiplication by a fixed element. For an element "x" in "P" define "xλ"("y") = "x" • "y", and for "x" in "Q" define "λx"("y") = "y" • "x". Then • is said to be residuated if and only if "xλ" and "λx" are residuated for all "x" (in "P" and respectively "Q"). Left (and resp. right) division are defined by taking the residuals of the left (and resp. right) translations: "x"\"y" = "(xλ)+"("y") and "x"/"y" = "(λx)+"("y")
For example, every ordered group is residuated, and the division defined by the above coincides with notion of division in a group. A less trivial example is the set Matn(B) of square matrices over a boolean algebra B, where the matrices are ordered pointwise. The pointwise order endows Matn(B) with pointwise meets, joins and complements. Matrix multiplication is defined in the usual manner with the "product" being a meet, and the "sum" a join. It can be shown that "X"\"Y" = (Yt"X"’)’ and "X"/"Y" = ("X"’Yt)’, where (X’ is the complement of X, and Yt is the transposed matrix).

Ruthenian nobility

Ruthenian nobility () refers to the nobility of Kievan Rus and Galicia–Volhynia, which found itself in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and became increasingly polonized, while retaining a separate, cultural identity.
Ruthenian nobility, originally characterized as East Slavic language speaking and Orthodox, found itself ruled by the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where it rose from second class status to equal partners of the Lithuanian nobility. Following the Polish-Lithuanian union of the 14th century, the Ruthenian nobles became increasingly polonized, adopting the Polish language and religion (which increasingly meant converting from the Orthodox faith to Roman Catholicism). Ruthenian nobility, however, retained a distinct identity within the body of the Polish-Lithuanian szlachta, leading to the Latin expression "gente Ruthenus, natione Polonus" or "gente Rutheni, natione Poloni" (translated as "of Polish nationality, but Ruthenian origin", "of Ruthenia race and Polish nation", or in various similar veins), although the extent to which they retained and maintained this separate identity is still debated by scholars, and varied based on time and place.
Eventually, following the Union of Lublin in 1569, most of the territories of Ruthenia became part of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The transfer of Ruthenian lands from the Grand Duchy to Poland occurred with a strong support of the Ruthenian nobility, who were attracted to the Polish culture and desired the privileges of the Polish nobility. Thus the Ruthenian nobility gravitated from the Lithuanian noble tradition towards the Polish noble one, described by Stone as a change from "wealth without legal rights" to "defined individual and corporate rights". The Lithuanian, Polish and Ruthenian nobility gradually became more and more unified, particularly with regards to their standing as a socio-political class. After the Union of Lublin, Ruthenian nobility eventually mostly disappeared from the Galicia region, but remained strong in the Volhynia region. By 19th and 20th century, the Ruthenian nobility became so heavily polonized, that the eventual national resurgence of Belarus and Ukraine was mostly spurred by the growing national consciousness of the new middle class, rather than of the nobility.
Some of the major Ruthenian noble families (all of which became polonized to a significant extent) included the Czartoryski family, Ostrogski family, Sanguszko family, Sapieha, Wiśniowiecki family, Zasławski family and the Zbaraski family.
Belarus.
Noble people on Belarusian lands (, szlachta) were usually of Slavic (Ruthenian) origin in the east or of Baltic (Lithuanian in historical context, Litvin) origin in the west of the lands of what is now Belarus. The percentage of nobility among inhabitants of the lands of modern Belarus was very high compared to other countries: 10%-12% at the end of 18th century compared to 1% in Russia, Prussia or Austria of that time. According to the historian Anatol Hrytskievich, this was because of the necessity to have a large amount of military szlachta was the base for.
History.
Ruthenian duchies of Polatsk, Turau and Pinsk, Drutsk and others have been incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ruthenian gentry became the largest part of the common Lithuanian nobility. 
At the same time, the Baltic nobility of Lithuania Propria actively adopted Ruthenian culture, language and traditions. The Lithuanian higher nobility largely embraced Slavic customs and Orthodox Christianity.Much of the upper class of the Grand Duchy called themselves Lithuanians (Litviny), yet spoke the Ruthenian language (also referred to as Old Belarusian language) In the effect of the processes, Lithuanian higher nobility became largely Ruthenian, while the lesser nobility in the ethnic Baltic lands of what is now Republic of Lithuania continued to use native spoken Lithuanian language. The adapted Old Church Slavonic and later the Ruthenian language, acquired a status of a main chancery language in the local matters and relations with other Orthodox principalities as "lingua franca", and Latin was used in relations with the Western Europe.
Fusion of Ruthenian and Lithuanian gentries.
In the 16th century 80% of feudals on Belarusian lands were of Ruthenian ethnicity and 19% of Baltic. No major conflicts between Ruthenian and Baltic szlachta of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania are known. Equality of their rights was also guaranteed by the Lithuanian Statutes of 1529, 1566 and 1588. As time passed, the differences between Lithuanian and Ruthenian fractions of the nobility of the inside the Grand Duchy of Lithuania practically disappeared.
Polonization.
Until the 16th century Old Belarusian language was used by most of the szlachta of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including the Grand Dukes and including the region of Samogitia, both in formal affairs and in private. From the 16th century Polish language became more actively used, especially by Magnates while minor szlachta remained Old Belarusian-speaking.
Since that time the Belarusian szlachta actively adopted Polish noble customs and traditions, such as Sarmatism. However, despite that the nobility stayed politically loyal to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and defended it autonomy in disputes with the Polish crown within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Russification of the lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 19th century and early 20th century.
Belarus as part of the Russian Empire.
In the late 18th and 19th centuries Belarusian szlachta were active participants of anti-Russian uprisings on the territory of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Tadeusz Kościuszko (Tadevush Kastsyushka), a nobleman from what is now Belarus, was leader of the Kościuszko Uprising in 1793. Kastus Kalinouski was the leader of January Uprising on the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
By the 19th century polonization of the szlachta on one hand and russification and violent introduction of Russian Orthodoxy to the peasantry on the other hand led to a situation where the social barrier between aristocracy and peasantry on Belarusian lands became in many aspects an ethnic barrier. In the 19th century, the era of nationalism, local intellectuals of peasant origin and some szlachta people like Francišak Bahuševič and Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich contributed to the forming of modern-day Belarusians as a new nation of Slavonic-speaking inhabitants of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania and basing on the historical and legacy of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and previous Ruthenian kingdoms of Polatsk and Turau. At the same time Baltic-speakers of the lands of modern Republic of Lithuania formed into modern-day Lithuanians and the historical unity of Ruthenians and Lithuanians fell apart.
In the 20th century.
At the beginning of the 20th century the Belarusian nobility has been primarily politically active in the Krajowcy political movement. Still, some of them, like Raman Skirmunt or Maria Magdalena Radziwiłł, have been sympathetic with the Belarusian national movement and have supported the creation of an independent Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918.
After the October Revolution the Belarusian nobility was severely hit by Bolshevist terror. East Belarus faced Soviet terror already since early 1920s, while most noble people living in West Belarus were repressed only upon the territory's annexation by the USSR in 1939. Belarusian historians speak of a genocide of the Belarusian gentry carried out by the Bolsheviks
However, by the beginning of the 20th century many minor nobles in Belarus were hardly distinguishable from usual peasants, only top aristocracy faced repressions because of their noble origin.
Upon Belarus regaining independence in 1991, remaining descendants of noble families in Belarus have formed certain organizations, particularly the Union of Belarusian Noble People (Згуртаванне беларускай шляхты). There is, however, a split between the noble people identifying themselves rather with the Polish-Lithuanian szlachta and the Russian dvoryanstvo.
In 2009 descendants of the Radziwill family have visited their former family castles in Mir and Niasvizh.
Naming.
Initially, the Belarusian noble people were called "bajary" () (on the territory of what is now Republic of Lithuania the word "bajorai" was used).
After passing of the Horodło privileges along with the word "bajary" the term "bajary-szlachta" (баяры-шляхта) or simply "szlachta" (шляхта) was used in documentation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that was predominantly written in Old Belarusian language. In 15th-16th centuries nobility in Polesia or Podlacha was also often called "ziamianie" (зямяне). Since the second quarter of 16th century the word "szlachta" (шляхта) became the dominant Belarusian term for noble people.
Religion.
By the 14th century the majority of the Belarusian nobility, both Baltic and Ruthenian, were Eastern Orthodox. After the Christianization of pagan Baltic tribes of what is now Republic of Lithuania in 1387 more and more noble people started converting to Roman Catholicism which became the dominant religion among aristocracy.
In the 16th century a large part of Belarusian nobility, both Catholic and Orthodox, converted to Calvinism and other Protestant churches following the example of the Radziwills. However, under the influence of counter-reformation in late 16th century and early 17th century most of them converted to Roman Catholicism. By the annexation of modern Belarusian lands by the Russian Empire in the end of the 18th century the Belarusian gentry was predominantly Roman Catholic while the rest of the population was mainly Eastern Catholic with a small Eastern Orthodox minority living in the east of modern Belarus. Still, there was also Eastern Orthodox szlachta in the surroundings of Pinsk, Davyd-Haradok, Slutsk and Mahiliou as well as calvinist szlachta.
Heraldry.
"See Polish heraldry"
Belarusian aristocrats had their family symbols already in the 14th century. One of the privileges introduced to the gentry by the Union of Horodlo was the usage of Polish (sometimes modified) coats of arms.
There are about 5 thousands coats of arms of Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian szlachta.

Pieter de Groot

Pieter de Groot (March 28, 1615 – June 2, 1678) was a Dutch regent and diplomat during the First Stadtholderless Period of the Dutch Republic. He led the Dutch delegation that vainly tried to negotiate the Dutch capitulation to king Louis XIV of France during the Year of Disaster, 1672.
Biography.
Family life.
Pieter de Groot was born in Rotterdam, the second son of Hugo de Groot and Maria van Reigersbergen. After his father's celebrated escape from Loevestein castle in 1621, he followed his parents into exile in Paris. Because of this Loevestein-connection (the name of the state prison was also used as an epithet by his Orangist opponents) it was later said of him that he was "un oeuf pourri, couvé a Louvestein" and he indeed suffered from a weak constitution all his life. His father personally schooled him, and took care of a broad education. He studied law at Leiden University.
He was twice married, first on October 6, 1652 at The Hague to Agatha van Rijn, and after her death in 1673, on July 11, 1675 at Rijswijk to his niece Alida de Groot.
Career.
After having spent a year assisting his father at the Swedish legation in Paris in 1637 he returned to the Netherlands and practiced law till Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine appointed him his ambassador to the States-General of the Netherlands in 1649. He remained in this post till 1660.
In that year he was appointed Pensionary of the city of Amsterdam. As such he was a staunch adherent of the States-Party faction of Grand Pensionary Johan de Wit. When he was ejected from that post as a consequence of the political upheavals that brought the Valckenier-faction to power in 1668, De Witt saw to it that he was appointed Dutch ambassador to Sweden. Two years later he became Dutch ambassador to France. He remained in that post during the difficult years leading up to the start of the Franco-Dutch War in 1672. He warned of the French war preparations, but was ignored by the Dutch government.
Capitulation negotiations.
De Groot had been appointed Pensionary of his native city of Rotterdam in 1670. He now took up that function and represented his city in the States of Holland and the States-General. The latter body decided to use his expertise in diplomacy with the French court after the French armies under the personal command of king Louis XIV had made a whirlwind advance into Dutch territory, and captured the important city of Utrecht. It was felt that the defense of the Republic was about to collapse, and that the only way to avoid an unconditional surrender was to offer Louis the Generality Lands and a large war indemnity. De Groot was sent to Louis' headquarters at Utrecht with this offer on June 26, 1672. However, Louis demanded additional concessions, like the cession of the Nijmegen quarter of the province of Gelderland, and public toleration of Catholic worship throughout the Republic.
The news of these negotiations caused a public outcry. The citizenry of the major Dutch cities now revolted against the De Witt regime (De Witt himself was severely wounded in an assassination attempt around this time, and could no longer take part in the government). One of the cities where the government was overthrown was Rotterdam. The Rotterdam "vroedschap" was forced at gunpoint by the city militia to swear that they would not give up the city to the French (as their Utrecht colleagues had done a few days before), without the consent of the citizenry. After the abortive negotiations De Groot and five of his colleagues in the city government were denounced as traitors by the Mob. The city militia closed the gates to a force of cavalry, sent by the States of Holland to restore order. The house of two burgomasters were sacked by the Mob. De Groot was personally threatened and had to move about under militia escort. He fled to Antwerp later in July. His post as Pensionary was taken over by the Orangist Johan Kievit who would shortly play a leading role in the lynching of the De Witt brothers.
Exile and trial.
Though in exile and disgrace with the new regime of Stadtholder William III De Groot could not resist interfering with diplomatic developments. He traveled to Cologne (by way of Liege and Aachen) where he offered his valuable services to the Dutch diplomats negotiating peace with the Elector in 1673.
In 1674 he was allowed to return to the Republic, only to be drawn into the scandal around Abraham de Wicquefort. That diplomat of Dutch descent, but with French connections, was accused and convicted of high treason in 1675. Unfortunately, De Groot had extensively corresponded with him, and his letters were considered highly compromising. De Groot, too, was therefore accused of high treason and court-martialed in 1674. He was acquitted on December 7, 1676 thanks to the able defense provided by his attorney Simon van Poelgeest.
The trial undermined his already weak health. He retired to his estate of Boekenrode, near Haarlem, where he spent his last years writing poetry. He died there, worn out, in June, 1678.

Hungry (The X-Files)

"Hungry" is the third episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 1999. It was written by Vince Gilligan, directed by Kim Manners, and featured a guest appearance by Chad Donella. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. However, unlike previous Monster-of-the-Week stories, "Hungry" is told from the monster's perspective. "Hungry" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.6, being watched by 16.17 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, a fast-food employee with unusual cravings becomes the focus of an FBI investigation under the direction of Mulder and Scully. The victims appear with no brain and a suction hole in the forehead.
Gilligan wanted to try a "different" approach to "The X-Files" with "Hungry" by telling the main story through the eyes of the monster. Actor Chad Donella, who portrayed the monster, was chosen because he possessed a "subtle, interesting quality," according to casting director Rick Millikan. Manners was pleased with Donella's performance, calling him a "great little actor." Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were filming movies, "Return to Me" and "The House of Mirth" respectively, the production company decided to film "Hungry" before any of the other episodes, despite the fact that it would be aired third, after the conclusion of "The Sixth Extinction" arc.
Plot.
In Costa Mesa, California, a young man named Donald Pankow approaches the drive-thru of a Lucky Boy fast food restaurant. Despite the restaurant being closed, Pankow angrily demands service. The sheepish fast food attendant tells the man to drive to the next window, where he is attacked and violently pulled out of his car. Pankow's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation.
The only clue found at the scene is a Lucky Boy employee button. Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover that one of the clerks, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When he is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.
Spinks visits Rob at his home the following day, annoyed at being fired from Lucky Boy for lying about his criminal record. He confronts Rob with evidence of his role in Pankow's murder - Rob's diet pills (to control his voracious hunger) with a bloodstain fingermark on the lid - and attempts to blackmail him. Later that day, Rob intrudes Spinks' residence to retrieve his pills, but hides in a closet when Spinks returns; noticing that someone is in his home, Spinks arms himself with a baseball bat. He discovers Rob is in his home after seeing a pill bottle (belonging to Spinks) on the ground and tells him that he's going to turn him in instead of blackmailing him. As Spinks heads to the closet, Rob takes off his disguise, opens the closet door, and reveals his true self to a stunned Spinks before killing him. Rob is later contacted by Dr. Mindy Rinehart, a counselor hired by Lucky Boy to consult the employees following Pankow's killing. In session with her, Rob admits that he is battling an "eating disorder." Rinehart sends him to an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, not fully understanding Rob's true nature.
Before attending the OA meeting, Rob is visited by Mulder and Scully, both who inform him that Spinks has disappeared; Mulder then reveals about Pankow's missing brain and that a "tiny shark's tooth" was discovered by Scully embedded in the skull. Mulder deduces that a "genetic freak" is responsible, which Rob nervously laughs it off. After the agents leave, Rob attends the OA meeting. At the meeting, he sees his kind landlady, Sylvia Jassey. Although he does not respond well to the meeting (by discreetly detailing the taste of a brain as "salty", "juicy", and "buttery" and especially visualizing a pulsing brain when a man turned to Sylvia), Rob and Sylvia bond on the trip home. Unfortunately, his hunger is far too overpowering and he is reluctantly compelled to feed upon her. To cover up her murder, Rob disposes of her body and smashes up his own apartment with Spinks' baseball bat. He tells Mulder and Scully that Spinks showed up and accused him of being the killer. Mulder then tells Rob if he recognizes Kiziak, the private investigator, but Rob says no. Both agents leave to find Sylvia.
Rinehart shows up to find Rob packing his things, intent on leaving town. After a bitter argument, with Rinehart revealing that she knew Rob murdered Pankow, Rob reveals his true self to Rinehart. However, before Rob prepares to attack her, she shows deep sympathy for him, throwing Rob off-guard. At that moment, the agents arrive with guns drawn, having found Sylvia's body. Rinehart tells Rob to be the good person she knows he is capable of being. Instead, Rob charges at Mulder and is shot twice in the chest, committing suicide by cop. As Rob lies dying, Rinehart asks, "Why?" To which he replies, "I can't be something I'm not."
Production.
Writing and casting.
When Vince Gilligan wrote "Hungry," he wanted to try a "different" approach to "The X-Files". Accordingly, he decided to write an episode that featured Mulder and Scully as the antagonists, as viewed through the eyes of the monster. Series creator Chris Carter applauded this idea and called it a "really great monster show." Gilligan's intention was for the monster to resonate with the audience. He wrote the part specifically so that the monster would be relatable. He later said, "My intention […] was that at the end, when Mulder and Scully show up and kill the monster, to have the audience out there hoping that they would not show up."
Chad Donella was cast as the lead monster because he possessed a "subtle, interesting quality," according to casting director Rick Millikan. Director Kim Manners latter described Donella as a "great little actor." Duchovny's stunt double, Steve Kiziak played the role of the private detective—also called Steve Kiziak—that Roberts kills and eats. Kiziak later said, "It was a lot of fun to be in front of the camera." Kiziak had first appeared as Duchovny's body double in the third season episode "2Shy," and would later appear as a Mulder lookalike in "Fight Club."
Filming and location.
As both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were filming movies, "Return to Me" and "The House of Mirth" respectively, the production company decided to film "Hungry" before any of the other episodes, despite the fact that it would be aired third, after "The Sixth Extinction" arc. This allowed Duchovny and Anderson to film their scenes and complete their movies with relatively little hassle. Several of the finished scenes show Mulder and Scully together, but many of these scenes were created with stand-ins and doubles because of the stars' busy schedules. Duchovny and Anderson were only available for two combined days of filming for this episode.
When it came time to design the sets, the production team found the Lucky Boy Burger restaurant to be relatively easy to create. Originally, the name of the restaurant was supposed to be Burgerlishious, but the restaurant location that was considered ideal had a "Lucky Boy" sign that could not be removed. Later, the design department faced a challenge in creating Roberts' apartment, because the script didn't give a detailed account of what it was to look like.
Broadcast and reception.
"Hungry" first aired in the United States on November 21, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.6, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 9.6 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 16.17 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 2, 2000 and received 0.68 million viewers, making it the seventh most watched episode that week. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "Taste the terror tonight!"
The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode five stars out of five, calling the premise ""Dexter" a decade early." The two concluded that "the sympathy that Donella gives Rob as he shows his true colours is very touching. [...] The final moments the episode are a typically smart touch to this neglected gem of a story." Paul Goebel of TV Squad listed Rob Roberts among his favorite "X-Files" monsters. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode features a "great setup, but the climax leaves the usual open-ended questions." Zack Handlen on "The A.V. Club" called the episode "perfectly acceptable" and awarded it a "B+". He was pleased with the episode's unique format, calling it a "good gimmick" that made an otherwise "forgettable at best" episode—had it been constructed in the typical fashion of "The X-Files"—into a memorable one. He was also positive towards the episode's use of humor, noting that it "is very much on target". Handlen, however, felt that the story showed the series' tiredness and did not possess much suspense to keep the watcher completely engaged.
Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She noted that the episode "suffers from a syndrome that has afflicted a great many "X-Files" episodes in recent seasons […] the syndrome consists of the audience finding out early on who the guilty party is." Vitaris, however, did note that the episode's "saving grace" was Vince Gilligan's satiric writing tone; she called the scene featuring Roberts hallucinating that the burgers he was frying were actually brains "sick, but hilarious". Other reviews were more negative. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, noting that, although the change in perspective was unique and interesting, "this bit of originality does not rescue the episode from a familiarity bordering on the mundane. It's not the first time we have seen genetic mutants who have an affinity for human body parts." Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a relatively negative review. Despite noting that the episode wasn't "horrible" entry for "The X-Files", Kessenich was unhappy with the characterization of Rob Roberts as well as the fact that the killer was revealed very quickly.

Ricemarch Psalter

The Ricemarch Psalter is an 11th-century Welsh illuminated psalter, in a late Insular style, that has been described as "Hiberno-Danish", instead of the usual "Hiberno-Saxon", as it reflects Viking influence. Its 159 pages are vellum, and include the following sections: Letter of St. Jerome to Chromatius and Elidorus; Breviarius Apostolorum; Martyrologium Hieronymianum, and Various Tables. It is one of two surviving manuscripts from the scriptorium at Llanbadarn Fawr in Wales, established by the father of the scribe and the first owner. The other is a manuscript of St. Augustine's De Trinitate in Cambridge, by the same scribe. The psalter is now at Trinity College, Dublin as MS 50.
History.
The Psalter was presented between 1064 and 1082 by a scribe named Ithael to his brother Rhygyfarch (Ricemarch in the Old Welsh orthography of the eleventh century), who was a resident of the school at St. David's. 
Their father, Sulien (Latinized as Sulgenus), who would eventually become the Bishop of St. David's in 1072, had previously lived in Ireland for 13 years for the purpose of study; the decoration is heavily influenced by contemporary Irish styles.
Style.
It is possible that Rhygyfarch penned a few sections of the manuscript himself, as the hand is not always consistent. He certain composed several verses himself, even if he did not scribe those sections of manuscript. Hugh Jackson Lawlor is of the opinion that the psalter was not written primarily by Rhygyfarch himself, as mentioned above, unlike other scholars. The large initials in the beginning lines of the manuscript pages are typical of other illuminated manuscripts of the time, with colorful Celtic interlace with animals. It is likely that Ithael wrote the text, while John provided the large initials and miniatures. The designs, while limited in variety, are highly regarded by scholars of illuminated manuscripts.
Other Insular illuminated manuscripts from Wales may include the Lichfield Gospels and the Hereford Gospels.

Bavarian D III

The Class D III engines of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") were tank locomotives designed for shunting and "Vizinalbahn" service.
Georg Krauss had exhibited a locomotive of this type, which had been developed on the same design principles as the Bavarian B VII, at the 1873 Vienna World Exposition and sold it to the Bebra-Hanau Railway. The Bavarian State Railway also decided to procured the locomotive and order six for the same duties as those of the Maffei-built Bavarian D I class, which had been introduced in 1871. 
The D I was equipped with an outside Allan valve gear and an enclosed driver's cab. Its coal and water tanks jutted out over the rear driving axle. 
The locomotives were used partly for branch line service and partly for light shunting duties "inter alia" in Munich and Ingolstadt, and also at Lindau working with the ferries on Lake Constance. Because the engines could not attain the performance of the Bavarian D IV due to their simpler design, they were retired between 1894 and 1897. One engine was transferred to the Röthenbach–Weiler branch line and one to the Bavarian Cement Works at Marienstein, the rest were scrapped.
One engine was sold, the remainder had been retired and scrapped by 1897.

Janice Biala

Janice Biala (1903 – September 24, 2000) was a Polish-born American painter well regarded both in France and the United States for her paintings of intimate interiors, portraits of her famous friends, and the places she traveled. In 1930, on a trip to Paris, she met and fell in love with the English Novelist, Ford Madox Ford. Remaining with Ford until his death in 1939, Biala became the perfect representation of American bohemia in France signing her paintings simply as Biala. Following the death of Ford in 1939, Biala returned to New York where she became one of the few women associated with the New York School befriending painter Willem de Kooning and critic Harold Rosenberg among others. In 1950 she participated in the important abstract expressionist discussion group at Studio 35 and exhibited frequently at the Stable Gallery.
Early Life.
Biala immigrated to the U.S. in 1913, arriving with her mother and brother, Jacob. They came to New York, where her father had already been living and running a tailoring shop. The Tworkovskys, which was their original surname, began living on Ridge Street in Manhattan. Biala and her brother changed their family name from Tworkovsky to Tworkov. This was done to help their assimilation to the American culture, something that proved difficult. 
In 1923 Biala enrolled at the National Academy of Design's art course. There she was classmate with Charles Hawthorne. Hawthorne later took Biala to his artist colony in Provincetown, MA. Biala also studied at the Art Students League of New York. Biala married fellow painter Lee Gatch. Unfortunately, their marriage did not last and the two separated. After that Biala became increasingly attracted to the bohemian life in Greenwich Village. 
She married artist Daniel 'Alain' Brustlein, a cartoonist for the New Yorker, and the couple began a lifelong process of living and exhibiting between Paris and New York.
Biala's unique contribution to the rise of modernism was celebrated throughout her lifetime from New York City to Paris. The albums of art history remark on her sublime assimilation of the School of Paris and the New York School of abstract expressionism. Her career as an artist spans nearly eight decades and two continents.
Biala was the sister of painter Jack Tworkov.
Exhibitions.
Biala exhibited extensively in the U.S. and Europe. Her first solo exhibition, entitled "Paintings of Provence", was held at the Georgette Passedoit Gallery, in New York. Two years later, she once again exhibited at Georgette Passedoit. That same year, she also had exhibitions at the Denver Art Museum and at the Olivet College. In 1938, Biala exhibited at the Galerie Zack in Paris. In the early and mid 1940s, she exhibited a lot in galleries of New York, especially at the Bignou Gallery. A decade would pass before she exhibited in Europe. In 1948, her works were on display at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris. Her works continued to be exhibited even after her death. In 2006, the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York held an exhibition of her works entitled "Biala: Selected Paintings". In 2007, the gallery again exhibited a collection of her works, entitled "Biala: I Belong Where My Easel Is". It was followed by another exhibition a year later, entitled "Biala: Collage", which exhibited her works from 1957 to 1963. In 2013, the Godwin-Ternbach Museum, Queens College, City University of New York organized an exhibition of her work, entitled "Biala: Vision and Memory".

Coffee production in Vietnam

Coffee production has been a major source of income for Vietnam since the early 20th century. First introduced by the French in 1857, the Vietnamese coffee industry developed through the plantation system, becoming a major economic force in the country. After an interruption during and immediately following the Vietnam War, production rose once again after Đổi mới economic reforms, reaching 900,000 tons per year in 2000. In 2009, Reuters reported Vietnamese coffee exports at "an estimated 1.13 million tonnes" for the previous year, stating that coffee was second only to rice in value of agricultural products exported from Vietnam.
History.
Coffee was introduced to Vietnam in 1857 by the French and slowly grew as producer of coffee in Asia. The height of coffee production occurred in the early 20th century as small-scale production shifted towards plantations. The first instant coffee plant, Coronel Coffee Plant, was established in Biên Hòa, Đồng Nai Province in 1969, with a production capacity of 80 tons per year.
The Vietnam War disrupted production of coffee in the Buôn Ma Thuột region, the plateau on which the industry was centered. Although seldom involved in conflict, the area was a crossroads between North and South and was largely depopulated. After the North Vietnamese victory the industry, like most agriculture, was collectivized, limiting private enterprise and resulting in low production.
Following Đổi mới reforms in 1986, privately owned enterprise was once again permitted, resulting in a surge of growth in the industry. Cooperation between growers, producers and government resulted in branding finished coffees and exporting products for retail. It was during this time that many new companies involved in coffee production were established, including Đắk Lắk-based Trung Nguyên in 1996 and Highlands Coffee in 1998. Both of these continued on to establish major brands distributed through a widespread network of coffee shops. By the late 1990s, Vietnam had become the world's #2 coffee producer after Brazil, but production was largely focused on poor-quality Robusta beans—considered inferior to Arabica due to their bitterness—for export as a commodity. Recent government initiatives have sought to improve the quality of coffee exports, including more widespread planting of Arabica beans, the development of mixed-bean coffees, and specialty coffee such as kopi luwak (, "weasel coffee").
By 2000, coffee production had grown to 900,000 tons per year. Price decreases, however, led annual production to drop to around 600,000 tons/year in 2003. In 2009, Reuters reported Vietnamese coffee exports at "an estimated 1.13 million tonnes" for the previous year, stating that coffee was second only to rice in value of agro-products exported from Vietnam.
The country's 2013/2014 coffee crop is expected to be a bumper harvest of around 17 million to 29.5 million 60-kg bags. Such a large production will add to a global oversupply of beans and will pressure coffee prices which have lost about 10 percent since October 2012. The country's coffee industry has taken a hit; of the 127 local coffee export firms that operated in 2012, 56 have ceased trading or shifted to other businesses after having taken out loans they can't repay. A few firms, such as Vietnam's top coffee exporter the Intimex Group, will benefit from the 2013 harvest. Intimex accounts for a quarter of the country's coffee exports and made $1.2 billion in revenue in 2012.
The amount of non-performing loans or debts in the coffee sector likely to go unpaid stands at 8 trillion dong ($379 million), which is around 60 percent of all loans for the coffee industry in Vietnam. 
Production.
Most coffee producers are private and state owned, such as Trung Nguyen Coffee Company Ltd., Hung Phat Company Ltd., Tam Chau Tea and Coffee Company Ltd., Viet Pacific Co. Ltd. known as Vietcoffee, and Vinacafe (Vietnam National Coffee Corporation). Highlands Coffee, a privately owned producer, was the first private company in Vietnam ever registered to an Overseas Vietnamese. A number of international players, such as Nestlé, have been established in Vietnam following economic liberalization in the 1990s.
Vietnam is the second largest producer after Brazil, accounting for 14.3 per cent of the world market share. The quality of the beans, however, has typically limited their marketability. Robusta coffee accounts for 97 per cent of Vietnam's total output, with 1.17 million tonnes exported in 2009, a value of USD 1.7 billion. Arabica production is expected to rise owing to the expansion of growing areas. Other types of coffee grown in Vietnam include Chari (Excelsa) and Catimor.
Style.
Vietnamese (Buôn Ma Thuột region) style coffee has characteristics that distinguish it from other coffees and brewing methods:
Availability in other countries.
In the USA, Vietnamese-style coffee is sometimes confused with that brewed in Louisiana with French roast coffee with chicory. Vietnamese immigrants who came to the state in the late 20th century adopted New Orleans-style coffee because they were unable to get Vietnamese-grown coffee. The French roast style popular in Louisiana was similar to Vietnamese coffee in its relatively coarse grind; therefore it made an excellent substitute for traditional brewing in the single-serving filter/brewer. In Vietnam, however, locally produced coffees are characterized by medium roast and don't contain chicory.

Sierra Leonean migration to the UK has a long history, with traders, chiefs, doctors and lawyers sending their children to be educated in Britain in increasing numbers from the mid-19th century. Previously, in the late 18th century, the Province of Freedom was founded by free and freed Africans Americans, West Indians, and Black Britons from England who were transported to Sierra Leone and founded the Province of Freedom through the support of the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor. Their colony lasted from 1787-1789 when it was destroyed.
There was a small Sierra Leonean population in the UK in the early part of the 20th century and Sierra Leoneans served in the British armed forces during World War II. More recent migration from Sierra Leone to the UK has included refugees fleeing the Sierra Leone Civil War. One author states that some 17,000 Sierra Leonean refugees arrived in the UK between 1992 and 2003. Smaller numbers of refugees arrived prior to the war, starting in the 1960s. The Sierra Leonean migrant population includes numerous ethnic groups, including Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. Most Sierra Leonean refugees in the UK live in London, with smaller numbers found in Manchester and other major cities.
Background.
Many British traders in the Service of the Royal African Company went to Sierra Leone during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many had children with women from the Sherbro tribe and their descendants can be found in Sierra Leone today. Thus a number of Sierra Leoneans (particularly those from the Sherbro and Creole ethnic groups) can trace their ancestry back to British traders, colonial officials, and former slave traders.

Munson Line

The Munson Steamship Line, frequently shortened to the Munson Line, was an American steamship company that operated in the Atlantic Ocean primarily between U.S. ports and ports in the Caribbean and South America. The line was founded in 1899 as a freight line, added passenger service in 1919, and went out of business in 1937.
History.
The Munson Steamship Line was founded in 1899 by Walter D. Munson, who built a freight line from New York to Havana into a line that encompassed eastern Cuba, Mexico, and ports on the Gulf of Mexico and operated over 60 freighters, and becoming the largest ocean freight company on the Eastern Seaboard. Walter Munson was succeeded first by his son Carlos, and, later, by his son Frank Munson shortly after the end of World War I. The , built by Maryland Steel in Baltimore, became the first passenger liner and was employed on the eastern Cuba route.
Frank Munson, after securing former German steamers seized during the war, began New York–South America service with (the ex-"Prinz Joachim" of the Hamburg America Line) in December 1919. , a former Austro-American Line steamer, and , and , all former North German Lloyd steamers, were added to the service by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) soon after.
In July 1921, four Type 535 class ships—, , , and —were assigned to the Munson Line by the USSB (and the former North German Lloyd ships were returned). In 1922, "Martha Washington" was returned to Italy after an act of Congress declared that she belonged to the Cosulich Line. , built at New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, was added to Caribbean service in 1921.
In 1925, Munson Line bought outright the USSB ships. In 1931, "Western World" ran aground off the coast of Brazil, where she would remain for four months before finally arriving in New York for repairs. But the Great Depression dramatically reduced ocean traffic and the company slowly dwindled in size, laying up ships or scrapping them to save the costs of operating them. By 1937, the United States Maritime Commission, a successor to the USSB, had taken over the remaining ships of the troubled line when it declared bankruptcy in 1937.
Passenger ships operated by the Munson Line.

Bambuco Bridge

The Bambuco Bridge was a temporary outdoor sculpture in the form of a simple suspension bridge spanning the River Tyne, England, made entirely from bamboo wood. The public art was designed and built for the "SummerTyne" festival, part of the NewcastleGateshead initiative.
History.
The 'bridge' was only a sculpture and could not be used for human or vehicular transport. The sculpture opened for its three-day run at 10:00am on 18 July 2008, and closed on 20 July; the opening coincided with the start of the ten-day SummerTyne festival. There was a light show at 21:00 on 18 July to officially mark the occasion. After the three-day period, the bridge was dismantled in late July.
Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead commissioned the Australian based firm Bambuco to create the bridge sculpture from 20 tonnes (in 800 pieces) of bamboo in 2008, the 80th anniversary of the construction of the Tyne Bridge. The sculpture's construction started in late June 2008. It was located between the Tyne Bridge and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge and spanned across the river, at a height of . The sculpture—which had its legs next to the HMS "Calliope" on the Gateshead bank and the law courts on the Newcastle bank—was also at a slight angle across the river. The founder of Bambuco, Simon Barley had the initial idea of a bamboo bridge over the Tyne, but died in 2007 before the project could be undertaken; Bambuco toyed with calling this bridge the "Bridge of Si’s", a play on Venice’s Bridge of Sighs.

<doc id="18272728" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18272728" title="Gravity tractor">
Gravity tractor

A gravity tractor (GT) is a spacecraft that deflects another object in space, typically a potentially hazardous asteroid that might impact Earth, without physically contacting it, using only its gravitational field to transmit the required impulse.
The tractor spacecraft could either hover near the object being deflected or orbit near it.
The concept has two key advantages: namely that essentially nothing need be known about the mechanical composition and structure of the asteroid in advance and that the relatively small amounts of force used enable extremely precise orbit manipulation and determination.
Advantages.
A number of considerations arise concerning means for avoiding a devastating collision with an asteroidal object, should one be discovered on a trajectory that were determined to lead to Earth impact at some future date. One of the main challenges is how to transmit the impulse required (possibly quite large), to an asteroid of unknown mass, composition, and mechanical strength, without shattering it into fragments, some of which might be themselves dangerous to Earth if left in a collision orbit.
The GT solves this problem by gently accelerating the object as a whole over an extended period of time, using the spacecraft's own mass and associated gravitational field to effect the necessary deflecting force.
Because of the universality of gravitation, affecting as it does all mass alike, the asteroid would be accelerated almost uniformly as a whole, with only tidal forces (which should be extremely small) causing any stresses to its internal structure.
A further advantage is that a transponder on the spacecraft, by continuously monitoring the position and velocity of the tractor/asteroid system, could enable the post-deflection trajectory of the asteroid to be accurately known, ensuring its final placement into a safe orbit.
Limitations.
Limitations of the tractor concept include the exhaust configuration. With the most efficient hovering design (that is, pointing the exhaust directly at the target object for maximum force per unit of fuel), the expelled reaction mass hits the target head-on, imparting a force in the exact opposite direction to the gravitational pull of the tractor. It would therefore be necessary to use the orbiting-tractor scheme described below, or else design the hovering tractor so that its exhaust is directed at a slight angle away from the object, while still pointing "down" enough to keep a steady hover. This requires greater thrust and correspondingly increased fuel consumption for each m/s change in the target's velocity.
Issues of the effect of ion propulsion thrust on the dust of asteroids have been raised, suggesting that alternative means to control the station keeping position of the gravity tractor may need to be considered. In this respect, solar sails have been suggested.
According to Rusty Schweickart, the gravitational tractor method is also controversial because during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory the point on Earth where it could most likely hit would be slowly shifted across different countries. It means that the threat for the entire planet would be minimized at the cost of some specific states' security. In Schweickart's opinion, choosing the way the asteroid should be "dragged" would be a tough diplomatic decision.
Example.
To get a feel for the magnitude of these issues, let us suppose that a NEO of size around 100 m, and mass of one million metric tons, threatened to impact Earth. Suppose also that
With these parameters, the required impulse would be: "V" × "M"  = 0.01 [kg = 107 [N-s], so that the average tractor force on the asteroid for 10 years (which is 3.156×108 seconds), would need to be about 0.032 newtons.
An ion-electric spacecraft with a specific impulse of 10,000 N-s per kg, corresponding to an ion beam velocity of 10 km/s (about twenty times that obtained with the best chemical rockets), would require 1,000 kg of reaction mass (Xenon is currently favored) to provide the impulse.
The kinetic power of the ion beam would then be approximately 317 W; the input electric power to the power converter and ion drive would of course be substantially higher.
The spacecraft would need to have enough mass and remain sufficiently close to the asteroid that the component of the average gravitational force on the asteroid in the desired direction would equal or exceed the required 0.032 N.
Assuming the spacecraft is hovering over the asteroid at a distance of 200 m to its centre of mass, that would
require it to have a mass of about 20 metric tonnes, because due to the gravitational force we
have
formula_1
Considering possible hovering positions or orbits of the tractor around the asteroid, note that if two objects are gravitationally bound in a mutual orbit, then if one receives an arbitrary impulse which is less than that needed to free it from orbit around the other, because of the gravitational forces between them, the impulse will alter the momentum of both, together regarded as a composite system.
That is, so long as the tractor remains in a bound orbit, any propulsive force applied to it will be effectively transferred to the asteroid it orbits.
This permits a wide variety of orbits or hovering strategies for the tractor.
One obvious possibility is for the spacecraft to orbit the NEO with the normal to the orbit in the direction of the desired force.
The ion beam would then be directed in the opposite direction, also perpendicular to the orbit plane. This would result in the plane of the orbit being shifted somewhat away from the center of the asteroid, "towing" it, while the orbital velocity, normal to the thrust, remains constant. The orbital period would be a few hours, essentially independent of size, but weakly dependent on the density of the target body.

St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster

St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster is the only post-Reformation Carthusian monastery in the United Kingdom. It is located in the parish of Cowfold, West Sussex, England.
The monastery was founded in 1873, when the property formerly known as Picknoll was acquired for its construction in order to accommodate two houses of continental Carthusians in exile. Building took place between 1876 to 1883 to designs by a French architect, Clovis Normand, who had at his disposal a generous budget. The number of monks has varied: 30 in 1883, 70 in 1928, 22 in 1984.
The buildings are in a French Gothic Revival style described by some as "weak", although Pevsner's judgement was that "The plan is magnificent and can only be properly seen from the air". The church has relics of Saint Hugh of Lincoln, Saint Boniface and the Virgin Mary; and an unusually tall (203 ft) spire. It stands in the centre of buildings including a library with a collection of rare books and manuscripts and a chapter house decorated with images of the martyrdom of the monks' predecessors. The Great Cloister, more than a kilometre long and one of the largest in the world, connects the 34 hermitages to the church and the other buildings, embracing four acres of orchards and the monastic burial ground.

Samuel Jarvis

Samuel Peters Jarvis (November 15, 1792 – September 6, 1857) was a Canadian government official in the nineteenth century. He was the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Upper Canada (1837-1845), and he was a member of the Family Compact.
Jarvis was born to William Jarvis and Hannah Owens Peters in Newark, Upper Canada. He moved with his family to York, (Toronto) Upper Canada in 1798. For a time he attended the school of John Strachan in Cornwall, Ontario.
Jarvis was a member of the 3rd Regiment of York Militia during the War of 1812, seeing action at the Battle of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights under Isaac Brock, and later action in the Battle of Stoney Creek and Battle of Lundy's Lane. In 1814 he received two positions in the government of Upper Canada, Assistant Secretary, and Registrar of Upper Canada.
Jarvis was also appointed as a Clerk of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. Having studied law before the war, he was called to the bar in 1815. In 1817 he was named Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.
In 1817 Jarvis killed John Ridout in a duel. John was the son of Upper Canada's Surveyor General, Thomas Ridout. The Jarvis and Ridout families carried a longstanding enmity; in 1817 John Ridout had been ejected from Jarvis' office, and a few days later a chance encounter led to a fistfight between the pair. They agreed to a duel, meeting on July 12 at daybreak. The pair stood back to back, then took 8 steps, turned to face each other, after which Jarvis' second counted to three. The count of three was the signal permitting them to shoot. Ridout shot on the count of two but missed. Jarvis was livid at this violation of the agreement. Their seconds conferred, giving Ridout a second gun, then taking it away and allowing Jarvis to take his shot. He did, killing Ridout. Jarvis was charged with murder, but the charge was reduced to manslaughter before trial. Jarvis was acquitted, as all the formalities of a duel had been met, and the unspoken practice of the day was to acquit duellers. It was the last such quasi-legal duel in Toronto.
In October 1818 Jarvis married Mary Boyles Powell. She was the daughter of William Dummer Powell, the judge who had presided over his trial for the shooting of John Ridout. Around 1822 Jarvis moved onto land which he had inherited from his father, "Hazel Burn", a lot between Queen Street and Bloor Street. He cleared the southern part of the lot and erected an estate. On June 8, 1826, Jarvis and fourteen others, disguised as Indians, broke into the offices of William Lyon Mackenzie's newspaper "Colonial Advocate", where they smashed his printing press and threw it into Toronto Harbour. This act was in retaliation for negative editorials which Mackenzie had run about members of the Family Compact. Mackenzie sued and won £625, which was paid by donations from the Family Compact, and Mackenzie was able to set up a larger operation.
Jarvis was named Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Upper Canada in 1837, replacing James Givins, who was becoming senile. During the Rebellion of 1837, Jarvis organised a group of volunteers to fight on the government's side; the group was named the "Queen's Rangers" in honour of his father's old unit, also called the Queen's Rangers, which had disbanded in 1802. In 1845 he was removed from his position as Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Upper Canada. A three-man commission appointed to investigate complaints about the Department of Indian Affairs found substantial problems there. Witnesses to the commission testified about occurrences of bribery, fraud, religious discrimination and lack of interest in the welfare of the Indians under its supervision. To repay the government the money he had stolen from the Indian Department, Jarvis was forced to sell "Hazel Burn" to pay the £4000 that he owed the government. The estate was divided into town lots with a street through the tract. The street is now named Jarvis Street.
Jarvis and his wife had several children. A son, Samuel Peters Jarvis Jr. CMG (1820-1905) was a British Army officer (Major General) who served in South Africa (and died in England).

Russian troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the beginning of 12 January 1996, Russia has sent troops in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, via Tuzla. The move was motivated, in part, by the desire to improve relations with the USA. Location of Russian troops deployment became subject of an international debate: The Russians wanted to be deployed in the Bosnian Serb territory, and the U.S. wanted them deployed in Bosnian Croat territory. During the 1999 Kosovo events, the 1996 agreement on joint operations in Bosnia was cited as an example of successful Russia-NATO cooperation.
Russian position on post-war reconstruction of Bosnia remains, as at 2008, in line with the Western policy. In particular, in October 2007 Russia upheld the Western denial of ethnic voting (defended by the Serbian minority and the government of Serbia).

Spy basket

The Spy gondola, Spy basket, Observation car or sub-cloud car ( or ) was a byproduct of "Peilgondel" development (a gondola to weight an airship's radio-locating antenna). They were used almost entirely by the Germans in the First World War on their military airships. The spy basket could be lowered from above through the cloud deck several hundred metres, in order to inconspicuously observe the ground and to help navigate the airship.
Development.
The "Peilgondel" was developed by Paul Jaray to act as a heavy plumbbob for an airship's radio antenna. A free-hanging antenna wire would move and flex in the wind hindering communications; the added weight reduced this movement. Jaray then developed the "Peilgondel" further into a manned spy gondola.
Use.
Spy baskets were used on, among others, Schütte-Lanz and Zeppelin airships. , it was not always certain which airships used them: the blueprints for LZ 62 (L 30) and LZ 72 (L 31) included the spy basket operating plant but the German Navy was no longer installing them at that time; however a fish-shaped spy basket can be seen on photographs of the German Army LZ 83 (tactical number LZ 113). The Imperial War Museum in London exhibits a Zeppelin observation car that was found near Colchester after the Zeppelin air raid of September 2, 1916 which is believed to have fallen from the LZ 90. After the war the Americans briefly experimented with a spy basket on the .
Zeppelin spy basket development and use.
Captain Ernst A. Lehmann, the German airship captain, described in his book "The Zeppelins" how he and Baron Gemmingen, Count Zeppelin's nephew, had developed the device. To test the prototype he blindfolded the helmsman of the airship and allowed himself to be lowered by a winch from the bombroom in a modified cask, equipped with a telephone. Hanging some below the airship using a compass he could tell the helmsman which bearing to take and effectively drive the airship. He later recounted how, while returning from the aborted raid on London in March 1916 in the Z 12, Baron Gemmingen insisted on being the first to use it on their secondary target, Calais. The basket was equipped with a wicker chair, chart table, electric lamp, compass, telephone, and lightning conductor. With the Zeppelin sometimes within, sometimes above the clouds and unable to see the ground, Gemmingen in the hanging basket would relay orders on navigation and when and which bombs to drop. The Calais defenders could hear the engines but their searchlights and artillery fire did not reach the airship.
LZ26's basket was lowered from the airship on a specially constructed tether 1000 metres long; other airships may have used one approximately 750 metres long. The tether was high grade steel with a brass core insulated with rubber to act as the telephone cable.
Despite Gemmingen reporting a feeling of loneliness while being lowered and losing sight of the airship, crewmen would nevertheless volunteer for this duty because it was the one place they could smoke.
Its use is dramatized in the 1930 film "Hell's Angels".

Joe Thomas (American football executive)

Joe Thomas (March 18, 1921 - February 12, 1983) was a former National Football League (NFL) general manager and also served as the head coach of the Baltimore Colts for part of the 1974 season.
Thomas was director of player personnel for the Minnesota Vikings and the Miami Dolphins in the 1960s, staying with the latter until after the 1971 season, when he was fired by team owner Joe Robbie. Prior to the next campaign, he arranged for Robert Irsay to purchase the Los Angeles Rams for $19 million before exchanging them for Carroll Rosenbloom's Baltimore Colts in the most bizarre transaction in NFL history. As a result of this deal, Thomas became general manager of the Colts. After a 5–9–0 finish in 1972, the first losing record in sixteen years, Thomas began rebuilding the team, albeit controversially. It all started on January 22, 1973 when Johnny Unitas was traded to the San Diego Chargers. During the next ten days, Tom Matte would follow Unitas to San Diego, Bill Curry was sent to the Houston Oilers, Billy Newsome to the New Orleans Saints, Norm Bulaich to the Philadelphia Eagles and Jerry Logan to the Rams. By the end of 1976, he had had five different head coaches in his five-year tenure, having fired Super Bowl V-winning coach Don McCafferty after just five games in 1972. then following him with John Sandusky, Howard Schnellenberger. Thomas himself, and Ted Marchibroda. When he targeted Marchibroda next, despite two straight Colts playoff seasons, Irsay had had enough and fired Thomas.
Thomas then was hired as GM of the San Francisco 49ers in 1977 by new owner Eddie DeBartolo at the recommendation of Al Davis and immediately fired head coach Monte Clark. The 49ers went 7-23 in Thomas' two seasons with the franchise, and his biggest trade, a series of 5 high draft picks for O.J. Simpson, was a colossal bust, as Simpson proved to be washed up. Thomas also fired two more head coaches, Ken Meyer and Pete McCulley, and Thomas' third hire, Fred O'Connor, was fired along with Thomas at the end of the 1978 season. Fortunately for the 49ers, the new GM/head coach, Bill Walsh, targeted a quarterback in the third round named Joe Montana, and the two of them restored San Francisco's franchise from the lows under Thomas.

The Wii version was later published in North America by Atlus on October 14, 2008, and in Europe by BigBen Interactive on March 26, 2010, both without "for Wii" in the names.
Gameplay.
The game is a hybrid board game and role-playing video game with modes varying from story mode to battle royale in which four players are assigned a mission.
Players spin a spinner and then move to any spot on the board that is reachable by moving that number of spaces. Players will have the freedom to choose the direction they want to go. Landing on an "empty" yellow space or another player will typically cause a battle, but sometimes the player will encounter a strange traveler that may allow them to play them at a minigame, or hire their services to steal or harm the other players. The battle system plays out in rock-paper-scissors style, with the Attack option beating Counter, the Counter option beating Strike, and the Defend option resisting the Attack option. Multiple magics and stat changes play out both in battle and on the game board, while class-specific skills increase with player level.
Three starting classes are available to the new adventurer (warrior, thief, and magician), and following a pattern of leveling, eleven character classes are possible.
The game will always include at least two characters and the game allows one to four human players to participate. Human players may leave and be replaced by CPU opponents at any stage of the game, and vice-versa.
A key element of the game is hindering the progress of other players. Players can obstruct each other by hiring assassins, or bandits to cause harm to the player. They also have the option of stealing tax revenue and player-controlled cities. Due to the tension these events are likely to cause (known as Dokapon Rage), Atlus has dubbed the game "friendship destroying" in their marketing materials.
The game is won by the player with the most money at the end. The player who wins the story mode gets to marry the king's daughter. The king makes an offer himself if the player is female, but he is apparently rejected.
Plot.
The game takes place in a fictional land called "Dokapon Kingdom" which is being attacked by an army of monsters. Seeing this, the king offers Penny, his daughter, to be married to the player who finishes the game with the most money at the end of the game. 2-4 heroes hear this, and attempt to save the kingdom. The game ends when each of the main bosses are defeated, although the player can select other game options to make the game end faster. The player with the most gold in the end marries Penny, and takes control of the kingdom (regardless of gender.)
Reception.
The Wii version was nominated for Best RPG for the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards.

Basil Parasiris

Basil Parasiris (born October 28, 1965) is a former Montreal-area businessman who was acquitted of a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death on March 2, 2007 of Sergeant Daniel Tessier, a Laval police officer.
Execution of search warrant.
On March 2, 2007, Laval police executed a search warrant at Basil Parasiris's home on a quiet Brossard street on Montreal's south shore. The warrant, authorized by Gaby Dumas, a justice of the peace, gave Laval police the green light to use a dynamic entry – meant to surprise the person being investigated – to carry out their search for evidence. The warrant was executed before dawn and with dynamic (forced) entry. In general, dynamic entry is only allowed to be used in cases where there is a risk of a suspect destroying evidence if alerted that police are on the premises. A team of armed and plain clothed Laval police officers knocked down the door to Mr. Parasiris's home and rushed into his bedroom where he and his wife were sleeping. Unaware that they were police officers executing a search warrant, Mr. Parasiris assumed it was a home invasion; he rushed to his .357 Magnum revolver and shot at the presumed invaders. The first shot fired hit constable Daniel Tessier in the head, the other pierced his heart. Tessier's partner, Stéphane Forbes, was also wounded by one of 4 bullets fired from Parasiris's revolver in the 30-second shootout with police as was Mr. Parasiris's wife Penny, as she fled to a closet. Mr. Parasiris's two children aged 15 and 7 were terrified at hearing gunfire in their fathers house. The older son rushed and called 9-1-1 who informed him to stay calm.
Bail hearing.
Charged with first degree murder Parasiris stood for bail in front of Quebec Superior Court Justice Jean-Guy Boilard and represented by marquee Montreal lawyer, Frank Pappas. During his bail hearing, the judge focused on whether Mr. Parasiris was a risk to the community, or a risk to flee. Witnesses who testified for Mr. Parasiris claimed that Basil was a man of great character, who lived an honest and peaceful life. Never before has a suspect in Canada believed to have been released on bail for the charge of first degree murder. The judge suggested that the warrant the police executed on Basil's home did not constitute justifiable dynamic entry nor a predawn raid, and should have knocked prior to entering. During the bail process, Basil Parasiris claimed that he intentionally did fire his revolver at Sergeant Daniel Tesser under the impression that it was a robbery. He also claimed that he did not recognize Sergeant Tessier as a police officer until after he fell where the word, "Police," was marked on the back of his vest. After testimony from witnesses and from Basil Parasiris, Justice Boilard came to the decision of allowing Basil to be given bail- a first for first degree murder in Canada according to Basil's lawyer Frank Pappas. His conditions included abiding by a curfew, living with his parents, and having a sister and cousin post $100,000.00 bond.
According to media versions at the time of this shooting, the bullet that wounded Penny was fired from a police weapon. The police also fired several rounds into the children's bedroom.
Verdict and acquittals.
Basil Parasiris faced a variety of charges; including the attempted murder charge on Tessier's partner, Stephane Forbes, two weapons charges and first degree murder. On June 10, 2008 Quebec Judge Guy Cournoyer found that there was insufficient evidence to convict Mr. Parasiris of attempted murder or the weapons charges. Justice Cournoyer then ordered the jury to sequester and consider coming to a verdict only on the murder charge.
On Friday June 13, 2008, the jury reached a not guilty verdict on the charge of first degree murder of a police officer. The jury suggested that there was reasonable ground to believe that Mr. Parasiris acted in self-defence believing the police officers who he thought were attackers were going to harm his wife and children while the Judge deemed that the search warrant which was used to enter Mr. Parasiris's suburban home was illegal.
Aftermath.
Many cited this tragic case as the result of police errors that could have been avoided. Laval police Chief Jean-Pierre Gariépy expressed dismay at the verdict, citing the reasons why the officers were at Mr. Parasiris's home to begin with. Chief Gariépy assured that he would suggest to the Quebec's Public Security Department that they review the policies and procedures behind the use of dynamic entry on search warrants to avoid such complications again in the near future. Thousands of police officers from Quebec and elsewhere in Canada marched on the day of Daniel Tessier's funeral to protest his death. Mr. Parasiris claims that the police are trying to cover their mistakes in his case, and attempting to frame him as a drug kingpin. He is also considering filing a lawsuit against the Laval police for defamation of character.
On Tuesday July 27, 2010, police in Laval, Quebec announced they were countersuing Mr. Parasiris, believing that there was enough evidence to pursue him for damages.

The Church's One Foundation

The Church's One Foundation is a Christian hymn written in the 1860s by Samuel John Stone.
The hymn was written as a direct response to some teaching, considered unorthodox at the time, by John William Colenso, first Bishop of Natal, which created schism within the Church of South Africa. This topic is alluded to within the fourth verse of the text "Though with a scornful wonder men see her sore oppressed, by schisms rent asunder, by heresies distressed." When Bishop Colenso was deposed for his teachings, he appealed to the higher ecclesiastical authorities in England.
It was then that Samuel Stone became involved in the debate. It inspired him to write a set of hymns based on the Apostles' Creed in 1866. He titled it, "Lyra Fidelium; Twelve Hymns on the Twelve Articles of the Apostles' Creed". "The Church's One Foundation" is based on the "ninth" article, "The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of Saints."
The hymn also served as inspiration for Rudyard Kipling's 1896 poem, "Hymn Before Action".
It is typically set to the tune "Aurelia" by Samuel Sebastian Wesley.
Popular Usage.
Science Fiction author David Weber has used portions of "The Church's One Foundation" as book titles for his Safehold series.

Bill's Bus

Bill's Bus is a privately owned commercial bus service that runs from Isla Vista, California to Goleta and Santa Barbara bars, picking up and dropping off college students for a fee. As an effort to prevent drunk driving, rides have sometimes been sponsored by local bars and UC Santa Barbara's Associated Students. During the trips, riders sometimes get sick, engage in late night hook ups, and pee out the window. It is popular among students, with multiple buses running on Thursdays and other busy nights.
William J. Singer founded Bill's Bus in 1991, when he was 19 years old. In 2002 the service was briefly suspended, and in a related news article, Singer said "There’s no money in it...I’m trying to do something that will make a difference." The business faced financial trouble in 2003, and in 2004 Singer sold it to Craig Jenkins, owner of the Velvet Jones bar in downtown Santa Barbara. In 2010, a UCSB alumnus started a competing bus line.
There was a separate service in San Diego called Bill's Bus, which went between Pacific Beach and downtown. That service is no longer in operation.

NFPA 1123

NFPA 1123, subtitled "Code for Fireworks Display" is a code administered, copyrighted, and published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). NFPA 1123 is the registered trademark of an American consensus standard which, like many NFPA documents, is systematically revised on a three year cycle.
The standard, despite its title, is not a legal code, it is not published as an instrument of law and has no statutory authority unless adopted by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). The standard, widely adopted in the United States, is however deliberately crafted with language suitable for mandatory application to facilitate adoption into law by those empowered to do so.
Document Scope.
The scope of the document is described as below on the NFPA website:
"Document Scope: 1.1.1 This code shall apply to the construction, handling, and use of fireworks and equipment intended for outdoor fireworks display.

Line 8, Beijing Subway

Line 8 of the Beijing Subway (), formerly known as the Olympic Branch Line (奥运支线), is a rapid transit line in northern Beijing. The line currently has 17 stations in operation and runs from Zhuxinzhuang in Changping District to Nanluoguxiang in Dongcheng Districts. Line 8's color is green.
Line 8 sits on the central north-south axis of the city of Beijing, which is aligned through the Drum Tower, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, and Yongdingmen. Line 8 opened on July 19, 2008 as the Olympic Branch Line to serve the Olympic Green, located due north of the city centre, during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The line had only four stations and of track. Line 8 was extended by six stations to the north in 2011, by two stations to the south in 2012, and by more three stations to the north and two more to the south on December 28, 2013.
The line is still being expanded along the central axis to the south. Line 8 will veer to the east of the central axis to avoid passing under the Forbidden City and Tian'anmen Square, before returning to the central axis alignment at the Qianmen Station. By 2017, Line 8 is expected to reach Wufutang in the southern suburbs of Fengtai District and have a total length of .
Fare.
Flat fare of RMB(¥) 2.00 with unlimited transfers.
Hours of Operation.
The first south-bound train departs from Zhuxinzhuang at 5:10am. The first north-bound train departs from Nanluoguxiang at 5:30am. The last south-bound train leaves Zhuxinzhuang at 10:05pm. The last north-bound train leaves Nanluoguxiang at 11:00pm.
Route.
In the north, Line 8 begins at Zhuxinzhuang on the Changping Line and heads east to Huilongguan and then south through the Line 13 arc at Huoying to the Olympic Forest Park. After two stops in the Olympic Green, Line 8 enters the Line 10 loop at Beitucheng and then the Line 2 loop at Gulou Dajie before reaching Nanluoguxiang on Line 6. The Andelibeijie and National Art Museum Stations are not yet open to the public.
Apart from the Zhuxinzhuang Station and an section of elevated track leading therefrom, the entire line runs underground. 
History.
Line 8 has been planned and built in several phases.
Phase I (Olympic Branch Line).
Line 8 was planned as the subway line that follows Beijing's central north-south axis. The first section of Line 8 to be built was the four-station segment from Beitucheng to South Gate of Forest Park, in length, that serves the Olympic Green. This section was included in Beijing's bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was awarded to the city in 2001. Originally, Beijing's subway planners also considered building a subway extension line off of Line 13 or Line 5 to serve the Olympic Green but ultimately chose to build Line 8 as a branch off of Line 10. Construction began in 2004. With other Olympic venues also under construction, Phase I of Line 8 was built using the cut-and-cover method to reduce the difficulty of construction. The Olympic Branch Line, as Line 8 Phase I was known, entered into operation together with Line 10 on July 19, 2008. Access was originally restricted to riders with an Olympic Register Card or a ticket to an event at the Olympic Games or Paralympic Games on the day of the event. In early October 2008, the line was fully opened to the public.
Phase II.
On December 8, 2007, while Phase I of Line 8 was still under construction, work began on Phase II to extend Line 8 in both directions along the city's north-south central axis. In Phase II was estimated to cost ¥10.1 billion and was scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Northern extension to Huilongguan.
The northern extension to Huilongguan, in length with six stations, extended the Olympic Branch Line north from the South Gate of Forest Park to Huilongguan in Changping District beyond the Line 13 arc. Land clearing for Phase II began in December 2007. Tunnel boring machines began work on October 16, 2009. In the fall of 2011, the entire Line 8 shut down and the entire line including the Phase II northern extension reopened on December 31, 2011.
The Lincuiqiao Station, just west of the Olympic Forest Park, was originally planned as an emergency stop, but was added at the behest of nearby residents and their municipal people's congress representative, Tian Yuan, who argued that the gap between the Forest Park and Yongtai Stations made subway access inconvenient for residents along Lincui Road. Lincuiqiao was officially added as a station to Phase II plans in December 2008.
Southern extension to Gulou Dajie.
The southern extension to Gulou Dajie, in length, opened on December 30, 2012 along with the Anhuaqiao and Gulou Dajie Stations. Travel time from Huilongguan to the Second Ring Road was reduced by a half hour. Daily ridership reached 203,000 in March 2013.
Sections opened at the end of 2013.
On December 28, 2013, Line 8 reached in length with the opening of the Changping-Line 8 Connector and the southern extension to Nanluoguxiang.
Southern extension to Nanluoguxiang.
South of Gulou Dajie, Line 8 was extended a further through Shichahai to the National Art Museum on December 28, 2013. Since the Art Museum station remains closed, the penultimate stop in the south, Nanluoguxiang on Line 6, became the southern terminus of Line 8. 
Changping-Line 8 Connector.
The Changping-Line 8 Connector, also known as the Changba Connector Line (昌八联络线) or Changba Connector, is a extension of Line 8 from Zhuxinzhuang to Huilongguan Dongdajie on the Changping Line. The Changba Connector contains two stations, Pingxifu and Yuzhi Lu, and forms the northern-most section of Line 8. The Changba Connector was designed to alleviate passenger traffic on Line 13 by allowing Changping Line riders heading to destinations in eastern Beijing to switch to Line 8 at Zhuxingzhuang instead of transferring to Line 13 at Xi'erqi. The connector was built from April 2011 to September 2013 and entered operation at the end of 2013.
Future expansion.
Phase III.
In Phase III, Line 8 will be extended further south from the National Art Museum Station through Qianmen and Yongdingmen to beyond the southern 4th Ring Road. Planning began in 2009. As of June 2011, plans of Line 8 in Phase III showed 14 stations over 17.3 km. Phase III was scheduled to be built by 2015 but the commencement of construction was not set to begin until October 2013. As of October 2013, Phase III of Line 8 is expected to open in two sections. In 2016, the southern-most section of Phase III from Zhushikou to Wufutang is expected open first, followed by the section from Wangfujing North to Zhushikou in 2017. In all, Line 8 is expected to have a total length of . 
Rolling Stock.
During the Olympics Line 8 borrowed Line 10's trains; after the opening of the first sections of Phase II new trains dedicated to Line 8 where manufactured by CSR Sifang Locomotive & Rolling Stock Co., Ltd.

Jerusalem Is Proud to Present

Jerusalem Is Proud to Present is a 2008 documentary film directed by Nitzan Gilady about the 2006 World Pride Festival, an LGBT festival held in Jerusalem. It follows the lives of members of the Open House, Jerusalem's LGBT community center, who are planning the events, the threats they and their families receive, but refuse to back down. The poster of the documentary features a young Israeli man who vows to lead the parade despite having been stabbed by a fanatic at a previous parade. 
The film relates the controversy over the festival, with orthodox Jews, evangelical Christians, and conservative Muslims united in their dislike of a gay festival being held in a city they consider holy. The film had its U.S. premiere at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival on 29 July 2008, and showed in 60 film festivals winning prizes.

No Torso

No Torso was an eight piece, DIY ska band from Oslo, Norway. The band began in 2001 as a three-piece with just Eivind, Chris, and Martin as members. Between then and 2006, the band would add members and drop only one until the current lineup was formed.
History.
Despite being from Scandinavia, the band is involved and celebrated in the United States' ska and DIY scene. This is due in large part to their relations with seminal and long-standing independent label Asian Man Records. Asian Man had released the band's debut full-length effort, Several Brains, in 2006 to warm critical and popular reception.
Since the release of Several Brains, No Torso has recorded a second release, entitled "Ready Already", which was also released during the West Coast leg of the band's first United States tour. The tour itself took place during the summer of 2008 and in some instances, was shared with other Asian Man bands such as Lemuria and Bomb The Music Industry!.
No Torso is distinguished by a sound clearly backed by a solid knowledge of traditional ska music, mixed with heavy DIY-punk influences, with Hot Water Music often being cited in this regard - the end result is a sound similar to that of an experimental Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Furthermore, the band's poetic lyrics and positive attitude have garnered them respect within the international ska scene as well as others.
On May 19, 2009 guitarist Martin Brostigen announced that the band had decided to call it a day. The decision was made after failing to replace Lars, Chris and Kristian, who all left the band after the US tour of 2008. All of the members went on to form new bands. They have all played together as a ska cover band that was originally named "Bekkestua All-Stars", and later renamed "Yoga Grossist", a word play on the Norwegian band "Jaga Jazzist". Nerland and Hamang started a punk band called "Hamstern and the Pepsikids", Brostigen joined the Norwegian ska band "The Phantoms". The horn section, Brænne, Solheim and Friis, have toured with numerous bands including Orbo & The Longshots, Noora Noor and Los Plantronics. Lars Oskarsen took a break from music to focus on his family, but has appeared as guest musician for several Oslo based bands. Dypvik joined "Amerikanerne", a reggae band from Oslo.

The film "Jerusalem Is Proud to Present" - 
Synopsis - 
In the summer of 2006, Jerusalem was to host, for the first time in history, the World Pride events, which were to culminate in a traditional gay pride parade. The planned events stirred turmoil in the politically complex city, with Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders banding together in an uncompromising battle against what they said would “defile the holy city”. On the other side stood the activists of the Open House, Jerusalem’s LGBT community center, who planned the events. Steadfast in the face of the heated and violent anti-gay sentiment, they had to deal with threats to much more than just their right to march…

The film "In Satmar Custody" - Synopsis-
In Satmar Custody reveals the story of the Jaradi’s, a Jewish Yemenite family, one of many that were brought from Yemen to the US (Monroe, NY) by the Ultra orthodox Satmar Community which operates a propaganda machine against the immigration to Israel.
The story exposes a deep cultural gap between the Yemenite families and the Yiddish Satmar Community that became distractive and tragic to families who have traveled thousands of miles to an entirely different planet of their own, with strange rules, norms, morals and lifestyles.
Still in Yemen, Yemenite Jewish families are brainwashed by skillful missionaries, unable to defend themselves in the eye of this intricate and deceptive operation. The film follows the life of Yahia and Lauza Jaradi who were brought from Yemen into the Satmar Community. It starts on the day that the Jaradi couple received an urgent phone call notifying that their two and a half year old daughter, Hadia, died in a hospital in Paterson, N.J. Through their search for their daughter’s body, they are getting closer and closer to what seems as the very painful truth about her faith.

Receivers were appointed for the line after financial improprieties and massive losses came to light. After review of the financial data, a United States District Court ordered that all the U.S. Mail Line ships be returned to the USSB.

U.S. Mail Steamship Company

U.S. Mail Steamship Company was a company formed in 1848 by George Law, Marshall O. Roberts and Bowes R. McIlvaine to assume the contract to carry the U. S. mails from New York, with stops in New Orleans and Havana, to the Isthmus of Panama for delivery in California. The company had the "SS Ohio" and the "SS Georgia" built in 1848, and with the purchased "SS Falcon" in early 1849 carried the first passengers by steamship to Chagres, on the east coast of the Isthmus of Panama. Soon the rapid transit time the steamship lines and the trans isthumus passage made possible when the California Gold Rush began made it a very profitable company. 
When in 1850 the Pacific Mail Steamship Company established a competing line to the U.S. Mail Steamship Company between New York and Chagres, George Law placed an opposition Pacific Line of steamers ("SS Antelope", "SS Columbus", "SS Isthumus", "SS Republic") in the Pacific running from Panama to San Francisco. In April, 1851, the rivalry was ended when an agreement was made between the companies, the U.S. Mail Steamship Company purchased the Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side ("SS Crescent City", "SS Empire City", "SS Philadelphia"), and George Law sold his ships and new line to the Pacific Mail. Law went into partnership with William Henry Aspinwall to develop the Panama Railroad in 1852. 
In 1852 George Law had a dispute with the Cuban Captain-general, the Spanish official was incensed because the purser of one of Law's vessels had published an offensive statement in a New York newspaper, and he refused entrance to any vessel having the purser on board. The American government refused to sustain Mr. Law in his determination to send the "Crescent City" to Havana with the purser on board, and withdrew the mail when he persisted. He nevertheless despatched the steamship, and the Captain-general failed to carry out his threat to fire on her.
The U.S. Mail Steamship Company only operated for 11 years. On the expiration of the mail contract in 1859 the company withdrew from the business. Its directors were said to be more interested in immediate financial returns than in providing a good service, so there was little public regret at its passing.

<doc id="18273498" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18273498" title="Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions">
Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions

The Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions (CELU) was an umbrella organization that represented a number of labor unions and employee self-help associations in Ethiopia. The Derg, the military junta which ruled Ethiopia at the time, banned the organization and replaced it with the All-Ethiopian Trade Union 8 January 1977.
History.
Although the 1955 constitution guaranteed the right to form workers' associations, it was not until 1962 that the Ethiopian government issued the Labor Relations Decree, which authorized trade unions. The next year, the imperial authorities recognized the CELU, which at the beginning represented twenty-two industrial labor groups. By 1973 the Confederation had 167 affiliates with approximately 80,000 members, which represented only about 30 percent of all eligible workers. The CELU drew its membership from not only the railway workers, but included workers at the Addis Ababa Fiber Mills, Indo-Ethiopian Textiles, Wonji Sugar Plantation, Ethiopian Airlines and General Ethiopian Transport (also known as the Anbassa Bus Company). The Ottaways note that the formation of a national labor organization, when only 27,000 people were employed in the manufacturing sector "was one of the paradoxes of Ethiopian politics at the time." They assert that the formation of CELU "can best be explained in terms of the country's foreign relations. A long time adherent to the International Labor Organization's charter, Emperor Haile Selassie apparently found it increasingly difficult not to respect it in practice, particularly at a time when he was trying to establish himself as a central figure in independent Africa."
However, during the 1960s the CELU failed to exert a serious challenge to the economic status quo for a number of reasons. One was that most of the membership were "white collar workers in such organizations as banks, insurance companies and airlines" who had little in common with their industrial counterparts. As a result, the CELU "did not seriously attempt before the revolution to establish a minimum wage." Other were flaws in the organization, which Edward Keller lists as including "corruption, embezzlement, election fraud, ethnic and regional discrimination, and insufficient finances. Seleshi Sisaye indicates that less than 40 percent of CELU's regular members paid dues. Annual revenues from dues averaged less than US$3,000. This forced CELU to rely on contributions from such international labor organizations as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the All-African Labor Congress, and the International Labor Organization to finance its operations." Further, when the CELU had attempted to flex its power in two general strikes in 1964 and 1970, both times it had failed to secure the necessary widespread support. Despite these problems, the Ottaways note that when the Ethiopian Revolution erupted, "as the largest organization representing any of the new social groups and classes, it was a potential force to be reckoned with." Rene Lefort observes that the Conferation "wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to increase the power of their organization. They launched a vast recruitment campaign (in two weeks the number of trade-union members rose by 40% to reach 120,000, according to CELU)".
The CELU's role in the revolution came in March 1974. The Confederation presented to Prime Minister Endelkachew Makonnen a list of 16 demands, and warned that if the government did not satisfy these demands, they would call a general strike on 7 March; most of these demands specifically concerned labor issues, and only five addressed broader economic or political topics. The Endelkachew government delayed in responding to this list until the day before the general strike would occur, and then simply stated that each point would be answered in three to six months' time. "To its surprise, the general strike began the very next day," write the Ottaways. "With 85,000 to 100,000 workers participating, the country's main cities, particularly Addis Ababa, were paralyzed. But the CELU had no funds to sustain an unlimited strike, though they had promised one, and workers had no savings to fall back upon. By the third day, many were back on their jobs. The strike lasted long enough to force the Endelkachew government to sign an agreement, but not long enough to extract significant concessions." Despite the lack of a decisive victory, this general strike inspired a series of wildcat strikes over the following weeks by the public employees of the different government bodies. CELU also increased its membership in the months following the general strike by a third, although the Ottaways argue that this "shows how great was its past failure to fully organize the working class.
Up to this time, the CELU was dominated by leaders like CELU President Beyene Solomon, who had been trained by American labor unions, saw the organization in purely economic terms and denied any intent to make it into a political force. But as the revolution progressed, these leaders were pushed aside by more radical members in the annual meeting in September 1974. Two factions vied for control, according to Rene Lefort: a much smaller one, led by Alem Abdi, which came to align itself with the Derg; and the majority faction, led by Marqos Hagos. Four days after the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie, on 16 September the CELU issued a communique condemning the Derg and demanding a civilian government, which led to the top three leaders of the CELU being arrested 24 September. Lacking the direction of a relatively moderate leadership, by May 1975 the CELU was under the control of one faction which viciously opposed the Derg along Marxist lines. The Derg ordered the CELU headquarters closed and the organization reorganized on 19 May, but eventually backed down and allowed the headquarters to be reopened in the face of worker unrest. 
By the time of the general congress in Addis Ababa that September, the political makeover of the CELU was complete. "The socialist, even Maoist, language of its resolutions was unmistakable," note the Ottaways. "American-trained leaders had been replaced by more radical ones who embraced a far different ideology and concept of unionism. but, as would become apparent later, the new leadership was far ahead of, and cut off from, the bulk of the confederation's own rank and file." According to Marxist theory, for the Ethiopian Revolution to be successful a vanguard party needed to be formed; the CELU, along with a number of civilian groups, opposed the Derg having control over the creation of this vanguard party. On 25 September, an Ethiopian Airlines employee was caught distributing CELU literature amongst airport workers, leading to a battle between workers and police which left four people dead and 22 wounded. The CELU leadership called for a general strike and went underground; the Derg placed the capital city under martial law on 30 September, and over the following month more than 1,500 civilians were arrested. The failure of the CELU to mount an effective protest destroyed its national organization, although individual unions survived, and a number of its leaders, including Marqos Hagos, joined the growing Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, which was becoming the primary opposition to the Derg -- and which became the principal target of the Red Terror.

Prep &amp; Landing

Disney Prep & Landing is a computer animated television special, based on an idea by Chris Williams at Walt Disney Animation Studios and developed by Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers-Skelton into a half-hour Christmas special. It first aired December 8, 2009 on ABC.
The special was released on-line the next day, along with an original one minute short film "Tiny's BIG Adventure". A sequel, ', aired on December 7, 2010, reprising the original cast with the addition of Betty White as Mrs. Claus. The second half-hour Christmas TV special, ' aired on December 5, 2011, on ABC, with another holiday special being planned for the future.
Plot.
Wayne, a Christmas elf, is part of an elite organization known as "Prep & Landing", whose job is to ready millions of homes around the world for Santa Claus's visit. After working with "Prep & Landing" for 227 years, Wayne looks forward to getting promoted. Instead, his former partner and trainee, Peterson, gets the promotion, and Wayne is introduced to Lanny, a rookie whom Wayne has to also train. Wayne is still bitter about the promotion, and decides to slack off during a mission. He permits Lanny to do all of the work, which is disastrous. Meanwhile, Santa is informed mid-flight of a massive snow storm and that Wayne and Lanny haven't fully prepared the house yet. He is told to cancel the landing, which has never happened before; they promise to make it up for Timmy, a boy living at the house. Wayne and Lanny discover that the re-routing was a final decision, but after hearing Timmy thank them in his sleep, Wayne decides to fix it. He calls up Santa, telling him that he must land at Timmy's house. Wayne and Lanny then work together to land Santa safely on Timmy's roof. On Christmas morning, Santa shows Wayne that Timmy had a merry Christmas. Santa offers a promotion to Wayne as the director of the nice list, but he turns it down so he can work with Lanny.
Production.
"Prep and Landing" was originally pitched by director Chris Williams as a short film for the newly re-opened shorts program at Walt Disney Animation Studios. Liking the idea, John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer of Disney Animation) considered it to work best as a television special and with ABC executives were keen to repeat the success of the 2007 DreamWorks Animation special "Shrek the Halls", approved the project.
Following Williams directorial debut on the short film "Glago's Guest", he was moved on to co-direct the feature film "Bolt". The special continued production under directors Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers-Skelton ("Goofy's How to Hook Up Your Home Theater") control.
Release.
The original premiere date was scheduled for December 1; however, a speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York on his Afghan war strategy by President Barack Obama delayed the special's debut one week to December 8, 2009.
The special was released on DVD on November 22, 2011, along with the short films "Tiny's BIG Adventure" and '. It was also released on DVD and Blu-ray of "Prep & Landing: Totally Tinsel Collection" on November 6, 2012, together with ', "", and "Tiny's BIG Adventure".
Hidden gags.
"Prep & Landing" includes a number of references and in-jokes left by the animators. Many pay homage to other Christmas specials and traditions. For example, Magee's office has the Christmas tree from "A Charlie Brown Christmas". When Wayne prepares to enter Santa's office, Miss Holly is typing the lyrics to "Jingle Bells". The clear to launch acknowledgement given by the flight controllers during the pre-launch check is "Dash away", and Magee's final clearance is "Dash away all" from the poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" ("Dash away, dash away, dash away all"). Timmy Terwelp himself is named in honor of Tiny Tim, a character from Charles Dickens' classic "A Christmas Carol".
Others are related to Disney itself. "Mickey's Christmas Carol" is shown on the television of Lanny and Wayne's assigned house. Although Timmy's residence appears to be in the Ohio Valley region of the United States, the latitude and longitude given for his house (N 34' 9' 20" / W 118' 19' 23") are of The Walt Disney Company's world headquarters in Burbank, California. A license plate with the characters "12501 WED" is a reference to the birth date of Walt Disney. The German Shepherd shown in the prologue getting dusted to sleep was a recolored version of the titular character of the 2008 film "Bolt", which was completing production as "Prep & Landing" was being made. Timmy's night-light features Goofy in a pose from the poster for the theatrical short "How to Hook Up Your Home Theater".
Lastly, some of the references were inspired by the show's co-director, Kevin Deters. During a scene in which Wayne is "being naughty" and making himself a drink, the milk carton Wayne is using has the logo of Deter's Dairy, a real-life dairy located in Quincy, Illinois, Kevin Deters' hometown. A toy giraffe in Timmy's bedroom is based on a similar toy belonging to one of Deters' children. When Santa shows Wayne what happened at Timmy's house Christmas morning, the home shown is based on Deters' boyhood home.

Lowell Power Canal System and Pawtucket Gatehouse

The Lowell Power Canal System is the largest power canal system in the United States, at 5.6 miles in length. The system's estimated output is 10,000 horsepower, operating six major canals on two levels, controlled by numerous gates. The system was begun in the 1790s, beginning its life as a transportation canal called the Pawtucket Canal, which was constructed to get logs from New Hampshire down the Merrimack River to shipbuilding centers at Newburyport, Massachusetts, bypassing the 30-plus-foot drop of the Pawtucket Falls.
In the early 1820s, Associates of the recently deceased Francis Cabot Lowell bought up the old Pawtucket Canal in what was then East Chelmsford, Massachusetts. Within a few years, the new industrial center that became Lowell was using canals feeding off of a widened and deepened Pawtucket Canal as a direct power source for their textile mills. The first of these canals was the Merrimack Canal, which powered the Merrimack Manufacturing Company. The repurposing of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals allowed the Associates to sell water power to other companies, starting with the Hamilton Canal, leading to the explosive growth of the town, and then shortly thereafter, city, of Lowell.
By the late 1840s, Lowell's canal system was producing as much power as possible. However, the Chief Engineer of Locks and Canals, an Englishman by the name of James B. Francis devised the Northern Canal and the Moody Street Feeder, to increase the capacity of, and availability of water to various parts of, the whole system. The Pawtucket Gatehouse was constructed to control flow from behind the Pawtucket Dam into the Northern Canal. 
The dam itself, which was built twenty years earlier, was lengthened at that time, diverting the entire Merrimack (during periods of lower flow) into the two canal system entrances above it. It is a stone dam topped with wooden flashboards – a system still used on this dam today. The level of the water is regulated by the flashboards and the metal pins that hold them back. When there is too much water going over the top of the dam, the pins bend backwards, releasing the boards, and the outflow of the dam is increased.
The Gatehouse contains ten wooden gates that control the flow of the Merrimack into the canal. Originally, they were opened by a Francis Turbine, also an invention of James B. Francis. Today, the Gatehouse is controlled electrically and remotely by Boott Hydroelectric, who is partially a continuation of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals, and who operates a 24-megawatt hydroplant on the Northern Canal.
The Canal System and the Gatehouse were designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the ASCE in 1984 and a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the ASME in 1985 and are part of Lowell National Historical Park. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and declared a National Historic Landmark the next year.

Epicurus the Sage

Epicurus the Sage was the name of a 2-issue limited series written by William Messner-Loebs, with art by Sam Kieth. Each issue was bound in a graphic novel format, and was 48 pages long, without advertisements. It was published by Piranha Press, the "alternative comics" imprint of DC Comics.
__FORCETOC__
Plot.
Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus appears as the main character of the book, traveling the ancient world with Plato and Aristotle's young pupil Alexander the Great, sometimes with Aristotle himself. Together, they wander into various major Greek myths (e.g. the kidnapping of Persephone by Hades), and discuss the philosophical questions raised, with a great deal of slapstick humor.
The book mixes history, mythology, and humor to relate the teachings of Epicurus. The narrative tends to anachronistically show other vaguely contemporary writers and thinkers, such as Aesop (who died two centuries before the historical Epicurus was even born), as backwards, foolish, fascistic, or all three, while the philosophy of Epicurus is portrayed to be more tolerant and humanistic; it is pointed out more than once that Epicurus is one of the only ancient philosophers who would teach women.
Various notable personages, from both history and mythology (e.g. Alcibiades and Zeus), appear as secondary characters.
Issues and reprints.
The original run of the comic consisted of two issues:
Collected editions.
In 2003, both books of the series were reprinted in a trade paperback (ISBN 1-4012-0028-1) by Cliffhanger, an imprint of Wildstorm. This book featured a new painted cover by Sam Kieth, a black and white "Epicurus" story from "Fast Forward" #3, and an all new 36-page Epicurus story by Kieth and Messner-Loebs.

Rush (The X-Files)

"Rush" is the fifth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files", and the 144th episode overall. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 1999. It was written by David Amann and directed by Robert Lieberman. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. "Rush" earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.9, being watched by 12.71 million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly mixed-to-negative reviews from television critics.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a high school student who is the prime suspect in the bizarre murder of a police officer. They discover that the boy and a couple of friends have been playing with the ability to accelerate their movements to a frequency the human eye can’t perceive.
The idea for "Rush" had been proposed as far back as the sixth season of "The X-Files". However, the original plot of the episode—the effects of having super speed—eventually delved into "deeper" themes, such as drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience. Although the episode relied on special effects, many of the scenes were created by manipulating the speed of the camera during filming.
Plot.
Tony Reed and two other teenagers meet in the woods late at night in Pittsfield, Virginia, but they are interrupted by a sheriff's deputy. Moments later the deputy is murdered, killed with his own flashlight. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later examine the deputy's body: the blow that killed the man was so ferocious that his glasses were pushed through the back of his skull. They question the suspect, teenager Tony Reed, whose fingerprints were found on the flash light, but he denies any part in the murder. Mulder and Scully agree that Tony is innocent, although Mulder's theory of spirit involvement is not shared by Scully. Scully, on the other hand, suggests they question Tony's friends. Mulder and Scully visit Tony's school and speak with the two teenagers who were with Tony in the woods: the sheriff's son, Max Harden, and his girlfriend Chastity. Chastity seems concerned about Tony when Mulder and Scully tell her he may go to jail. However, Tony is later released when the murder weapon mysteriously goes missing from the evidence room. Mulder and Scully review video footage from the evidence room that shows the flashlight simply disappear. However, a blur on the video footage attracts Mulder's attention and later analysis by an expert reveals the blurred object is solid and matches the local high school's colors. When one of the teachers at the high school who was strongly despised by Max is attacked and murdered by an unseen force in front of many witnesses, Mulder suspects Max possesses some kind of paranormal ability and is using it to kill.
Mulder believes Harden's changing teenage hormones are giving him paranormal abilities that allow him to attack people without touching them. Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in the woods and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same abilities that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave. Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun. Tony and Max confront each other at the cave, but Chastity shoots Max, using her abilities, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet. Afterwards, numerous geological experts examine the cave but are unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.
Production.
Writing and casting.
The basic concept behind "Rush" had been coming together since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, the way in which to portray the teenagers on screen was "tricky". He noted, "it had been a long time since we had dealt with teenage angst. it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it." David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply "[the effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." However, the story quickly developed "deeper" meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.
According to casting director Rick Millikan, choosing actors and actresses for the episode was more difficult than usual. He explained, "it was all teenagers, but this being "The X-Files" we were looking for something other than the typical "90210"-type kids." Millikan eventually cast individuals who could play a "subtle kind of evil", as well as display "arrogance" and "vulnerability". Rodney Scott was cast as Tony Reed. Scott, at the time, was more notable for his roles as David Cassidy in the 1999 television movie "Come On, Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story", and for his role as William "Will" Krudski on the popular show "Dawson's Creek".
Special effects.
The episode, most notably the scenes featuring the teenagers moving at high speed, relied heavily on special effects. However, instead of creating them on a computer, director Robert Lieberman was able to create many of the necessary scenes using different camera speeds. In order to get the proper feel for the rush effects, test footage of assistant director Xochi Blymyer was filmed at 24 frames per second (FPS), 12 FPS, 6 FPS and 3 FPS. After filming, a digital "blur effect" was added to make the shot look unfocused. During the scene where the teenagers stumble into the light and receive the speed power, the special effects crew shot two separate shots: one of the teens' bodies and one of the teens' heads rapidly flailing. The special effects crew then "pullthe head[s off" of the shots featuring the teens moving rapidly, and used them to replace the heads on the shots of the teens' still bodies. This method kept their bodies in focus but allowed their heads to rapidly move.
The crew used several different styles for the "bullet time" scene. In order to create the shot, a matte of the bullet emerging from Max's chest was combined with smoke and "phony CGI bullets", according to producer Paul Rabwin. The crew tried different tracking devices for the bullet, including a pronounced blur effect, which was later removed in favor of a more realistic "smoke" pathway. The production crew had a difficult time deciding whether or not the bullet should remain at Chastity's speed as she walked towards it, or whether she should pass the bullet; the group eventually went with the latter.
Stunt coordinator Danny Wesiles helped arrange the more frantic shots, such as the scene wherein a lunch table kills a teacher. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later called the scene, "probably one of the most horrific things we've ever done." Due to the violent nature of the episode—and the table scene in particular—Fox's Standards and Practices department had an issue with the series showing "the impact between the table and the man". In order to comply, the impact was removed, but the rest of the scene stayed intact. Spotnitz later noted that, "when you take out the impact, the audience's imagination is ten times worse."
Broadcast and reception.
"Rush" first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 7.9, with a 11 share, meaning that roughly 7.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 11 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 12.71 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 16, 2000 and received 0.79 million viewers, making it the sixth most watched episode that week. The episode was later nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Dramatic Series as well as an International Monitor Award for Best Achievement in Visual Effects.
The episode received mostly mixed to negative reviews from critics. Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She noted that the episode suffered from a "bland story" filled with "bland teens", noting that the actors playing the three main teenagers were "as generic as can be". Vitaris ultimately concluded that "'Rush' is hardly the worst of "The X-Files"; it's merely forgettable." Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, arguing that the show was re-using plot lines and that the personalities of the teenagers were wholly uninteresting. He wrote, "This episode unfolds with a bland sense of familiarity. Once again, troubled adolescents are toying with paranormal forces that can only get them into further trouble. Sadly, these adolescents lack interesting personalities, and the force in question remains wholly mysterious." Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode was "Not brilliant, but moderately entertaining." Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode two stars out of five. Despite praising the episode's set pieces, they ultimately concluded that ""The X-Files" just isn't cool anymore daddio."
Not all reviews were so negative. Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" awarded the episode a "B–". While enjoying the premise, he criticized the entry for featuring a guest cast that "mostly sucks". He did, however, positively comment on the scene wherein Max kills his teacher, noting that it "is a brutal, visceral sequence" that the episode could have used more of. Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a largely positive review, writing, "'Rush' was sufficiently creepy and had some wonderful character interaction between Mulder and Scully." Furthermore, he noted that the characterization "helped make it a very enjoyable entry into what is quickly becoming a very enjoyable season."

Pryor Brock Farmstead

The Pryor Brock Farmstead is a place on the National Register of Historic Places just west of Zionsville, Indiana, comprising of what was once a farm. It was placed on the Register, June 27, 2008, due to its role in the agricultural history of Eagle Township, Boone County, Indiana. Pryor Brock Farmstead, with its carpenter's rendering of Italianate architecture, is the best representation of the prosperous agricultural setting around Zionsville/Eagle Township during its time of significance (1870-1920), the "golden age" of Hoosier agriculture.
The farm was built by Pryor and Emeline Brock. Pryor was born on January 31, 1823 in Tennessee, and moved to Putnam County, Indiana in 1829 when his father Allen Brock chose to relocate; the family removed to Boone County in 1832. Pryor married Emeline Stoneking in 1846. It was in 1878 that the Brocks built the house, after some of their older children had already moved out. By 1880 the value of the land was $10,000 when the county average was $1,180. Emeline died in 1884, with Pryor eventually marrying an Emma Lemon when he was 68 years old. Pryor would be 75 years old when he died on October 3, 1898. The farmstead continued in the Brock family until 2006, when Rosemary Brock Rudwolis died, with a codicil stating the structures on the property should be maintained and preserved.
The wood-framed main house is a Late Victorian-Italianate structure, with a stone foundation, wood/clapboard walls, and an asphalt roof. Although well made, the Brock's purposely avoided "urban showiness". The farmland is one of the few elevated areas of an otherwise flat, featureless countryside. Partially covered boulders which came to the area as glacial erratics flank the entrance to the property.

Reflex neurovascular dystrophy

Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (formerly known as Reflex Neurovascular Dystrophy (RND) and currently referred to as Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)) is a painful neurovascular disorder. In amplified pain, a very slight sensation can become unbearable pain as the nervous system sets up a feedback loop similar to a microphone getting too close to a speaker. The stimulus goes from the nerve to the spinal cord and then short-circuits to the autonomic nerves that control the blood vessels. This leads to lack of blood flow (ischemia) so the tissues do not get enough oxygen and there is a build-up of acids that lead to pain. This new pain signal is then again short-circuited to the autonomic nerves which again decrease the blood flow. This vicious cycle is how the pain is amplified.
RND can be triggered by musculoskeletal inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, injuries, or have no discernible trigger. It can be exacerbated by stress. Stress may continue to play a major role in RND even after the child has RND under control.
The treatment for amplified pain/RND is extreme physical and occupational therapy in conjunction with counseling. There are several such programs, including the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania),; Boston Children's Hospital (Harvard University); The Children's Institute of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; The Pediatric Rehab Unit at Randall Children's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel in Portland, Oregon; Children's Specialized Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey; and Mercy Children's Hospital in Kansas City, MO. In a typical course of therapy, the child is put through five to seven hours of therapy a day for 2-3 weeeks. This includes intensive physical, occupational, and pool and/or yoga therapy. While painful, such therapy helps to improve blood flow and breaks the amplified pain cycle. These programs have long term success rates as high as 88%

Dr. Nelson Wilson House

The Dr. Nelson Wilson House is a place on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, Indiana. It was placed on the Register on June 26, 2008, due to its unique architecture (a mix of Queen Anne and Eastlake), and for being the work of prominent local architect John W. Gaddis. The "Daviess County Interim Report" gave the house its highest rating: "Outstanding".
Nelson H. Wilson, born in Jefferson County, Indiana on November 12, 1844, married Matilda M. Campbell in 1889. From 1890 to 1895 he practiced dentistry is Washington, Indiana. In 1893 they had the house built. In 1895, Nelson Wilson died. Sometime between Wilson's death and 1900 the house went to William Beck, whose family would own the house until 2001. Matilda Wilson died on August 11, 1914.
The Dr. Nelson Wilson House is a two-story Queen Anne-style house, with a brick foundation, brick and limestone walls, and asphalt roof, built in 1893 by a John W. Gaddis, an architect from nearby Vincennes, Indiana who would later become known for building courthouses, such as those for Clay County, Huntington County, and Putnam County. Gaddis included elements of the Eastlake style in the house as well, as demonstrated by its "stickwork"; it is highly unusual, however, that the stickwork was not done with wood, as typical in Eastlake, but instead with brick.
Of particular note are the pattern on the side porches, which is Masonic Cross pattern. This Masonic Cross pattern could be seen as a Maltese Cross motif, save that both Nelson Wilson and John Gaddis were active Freemasons, and the thought of deviating from the Eastlake style to the Masonic Cross style in constructing the side porches is easily explained in one of the two deciding on the style.

The Rochester Downtown Historic District is a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in Rochester, Indiana, United States. It was placed on the Register on June 24, 2008. The majority of buildings in the area are masonry and Italianate while structures outside the district are largely residential frame built structures. 
Rochester was founded as a trading post in 1831 between the European settlers and local Native Americans, along the old Michigan Road where it intersected Mill Creek. Most of the contributing buildings lie along the old Michigan Road, now Main Street, in a right-of-way pattern (the newer, non-contributing buildings do not follow this pattern).
Prominent buildings in the district include the Fulton County Courthouse (which is a Richardsonian Romanesque building also NRHP-listed), a water tower, Rochester City Hall & Fire Department, post office, and telephone company.
The limestone courthouse, which was already on the National Register as of September 22, 2000, is located on Ninth Street. Four different memorials are on its grounds: one for the Pottawatomies' Trail of Death, a cornerstone for the Rochester College, and two war memorials. Although most of the buildings in the district are constructed of brick, after the construction of the courthouse, with its rusticated limestone construction, it is believed that other buildings were renovated to match the courthouse using faux stone that was cemented to their brick structures; the Masonic Temple is reflective of this. Limestone is also used on the name blocks of buildings. The historic fire department has an engraved limestone name block above its door. The city hall not only has a similar limestone name block, but the right and left bays of the hall have limestone diamonds above them.

North Irvington Gardens Historic District

The North Irvington Gardens Historic District is a place on the National Register of Historic Places in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was placed on the Register on June 27, 2008. It is immediately to the north of the Irvington Historic District, which was already on the National Register since 1987, sharing the same east/west boundaries that the older district has (Arlington Avenue and Emerson Avenue respectively), and extends north to 10th and 11th Streets. It is mostly a neighborhood of residential buildings, with no one distinctive architectural style, including the historic Osborn Farm, dating from 1910 to 1950. Except for one church, only houses (843) and garages (551) are buildings contributing to the historic nature of the district. Most fences in the district mark the perimeter of the individual properties; very few are along the streets.
It was placed on the register for three reasons. First, it reflected residential development trends during its time of significance. Second, noted author Margaret Weymouth Jackson lived in the district between World War I and World War II. Finally, it reflected the various styles used in residence in a "textbook" manner, particularly "small houses".
One of the prominent buildings in the district is Harold's Steer-In, built in 1951, which is a contributing building even through it was built one year past the era of notability. Formerly the Northways Restaurant when it opened in 1951, and the Laughner's Cafeteria from the mid-1950s to 1964, when it gained the name Harold's Steer-In. Except for three weeks in 2004, when it appeared to have been closed for good until two employees invested in the restaurant and reopened it in time for a special Thanksgiving Day feast for loyal customers. It is one of the few surviving authentic drive-ins left in Indianapolis, and people love to hang out there throughout the year. Peyton Manning once filmed a commercial for MasterCard in the building in 2005.
The Irvington Development Organization was the driving force for the attaining of National Register status to the district. Money from the Preserve America grant given to the organization funded this effort.

Washington Park Historic District (Indianapolis, Indiana)

The Washington Park Historic District is a district on the National Register of Historic Places in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was placed on the Register on June 24, 2008. It comprises nearly and is located north of downtown Indianapolis, in the south-central part of the Meridian-Kessler neighborhood. The district includes all properties south of 43rd Street and north of 40th Street, and east of Central Avenue and west of the alley running north and south between Pennsylvania and Meridian Streets; Washington Boulevard runs north-south through the center of the district. It includes 110 contributing buildings, ranging mostly from mansions to small bungalows, and three non-contributing buildings.
Washington Park was annexed by the city of Indianapolis in 1906. The streets would not be paved until November 1916, with 43rd Street not having sidewalks and pavement until 1923. The apartments in the district, built in the 1920s and 1930, attracted young professionals who not only liked the neighborhood, but saw it as "prestigious".
The buildings in the district are a church (Holy Trinity Hellenic Greek Orthodox Church), two duplexes, a four-unit apartment building, eight doubles, 101 single houses, most of which were built before World War II, and two non-contributing (historically) brick houses built in 1986 and 1987 that do not contrast with the other buildings. Many of the contributing buildings are of different Revival architectural styles, particularly from Europe: Classical, Colonial, Italian Renaissance, and Tudor.
Of particular note is the Harry Hartley house, which was based on Château de Malmaison, a residence of Napoleon Bonaparte. Harry Hartley sent architect William Earl Russ to the original in France to replicate the French chalet in a smaller form, in effect creating a Napoleon complex in Indianapolis.
Another prominent building is the home of United States Senator Albert J. Beveridge. It was here that he wrote his biography of John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, which won a Pulitzer Prize.

Foden-NC

The Foden-NC was an unsuccessful design of double-decker bus built by Foden of Sandbach and Northern Counties of Wigan in the United Kingdom between 1975 and 1978.
Background.
Foden was primarily a truck manufacturer, although it had also built bus chassis in the past, whilst Northern Counties was a bus body manufacturer, building bodywork onto chassis produced by other companies. At the time of the design's conception, British Leyland had by far the largest share of the market for double-decker buses in the UK, with its Atlantean, Fleetline and Bristol VR models. The Foden-NC was intended to compete against these for a share of this market.
Design.
The Foden-NC was a semi-integral design, meaning that it has an underframe (chassis), but that the bodywork is also structurally load-bearing.
The transmission proved to be a weakness, with the Foden transfer box being prone to failures and the Allison gearbox inefficient. Derby City Transport refitted its Foden-NC with Voith transmission in an attempt to overcome the problems.
In appearance, the Northern Counties bodywork was very similar to the style built on other chassis (Atlanteans and Fleetlines).
Production.
Only seven vehicles were completed, one of which carried bodywork built by East Lancs instead of Northern Counties. An eighth, partially completed, bus was used for testing.
The vehicles went to the following operators:
Most of the vehicles experienced shorter than average working lives, although two of them (TUB 250R and ROC 300R) still exist, preserved in the care of Aintree Coachline of Liverpool.

Tippecanoe Twp. District No. 3 Schoolhouse and Cemetery

The Tippecanoe Twp. District No. 3 Schoolhouse and Cemetery is a place on the National Register of Historic Places in Tippecanoe, Indiana. It was placed on the Register on June 24, 2008. It includes the former schoolhouse of district 3, also known as the Summit Chapel School, that was built around 1860; a cemetery, established in 1844, and a 1930's outhouse built, presumably, by the Works Progress Administration. It is located on Tippecanoe's Summit Hill, the highest point in Marshall County, marking the southernmost point of a glacial advance. From the hill, the Tippecanoe River, one mile south, can be seen with a 270°view from the school. On the eastern edge is a hedge of osage-oranges.
A.H. Buckham donated the land that comprised the cemetery and school. The burial of his son Hiram in 1844 at the site established the cemetery, with the school built years later. The cemetery's northeast corner marks the highest point of the hill and Marshall County.
The school is a Greek Revival structure, built around 1860. It is a single story frame house, with an area of 25 feet by 30 feet. In 1910 a 12 foot by 13 foot cloak room was added to the structure. There were earlier outhouses for both boys and girls, but when the new WPA outhouse was built in the 1930s, it was a single stall with four feet of total area. The school was built towards the end of a decade where Indiana, following their 1851 state constitution being ratified, stressed the importance of increasing public schools of Indiana, resulting in the number of Hoosier students in public schools going from 161 to 882 in 1858, with only fifteen percent to the districts in the state without public schools. 
The cemetery is still an active cemetery.
In 2001 and 2002 a restoration project was begun on the school and outhouse, under the guidance of the Wythougan Valley Preservation Council, a local historic preservation group. A previous student of the school's told the renovators where to properly place the teacher's deck and map stand, and desks of the appropriate area were placed within. Both buildings were repainted, with roof improvements as well.

Arthur Watts (illustrator)

Arthur Watts (1883–1935) was an illustrator and artist who was killed in an aeroplane crash over the Swiss Alps. His first drawing for Punch, the English humour magazine, was published in 1912 and his work continued to appear regularly until the time of his death. He also did four drawings a week for the Radio Times; illustrated about a dozen books, including "Diary of a Provincial Lady" by E M Delafield; and designed travel posters for the railways and the London Underground. He edited and illustrated "A Painter's Anthology".
Many of Watts' cartoons highlighted the class distinctions that existed in Britain in the nineteen-twenties and thirties. They show an acute observation of differences in accent, vocabulary, dress, drinking habits and even table manners. Some of his sharpest barbs were aimed at the 'modern' art of the period. His contorted figures in paint, plaster and stone are clever caricatures of what he saw around him.

Crawford-Gilpin House

The Crawford-Gilpin House is a place on the National Register of Historic Places in Martinsville, Indiana, United States, thirty-four miles southeast of Indianapolis. It was placed on the Register on June 24, 2008. It made the list due its brick Italianate structure being among the finest in Martinsville/Morgan County, and for being the home of many prominent leaders in Martinsville history.
James Crawford, who had served the community of Martinsville as justice of the peace and built the first brick church in the town, had owned the property where the house was built since 1837; he was a "wheelhorse" who helped lead the local Whig Party into competitiveness against the majority Democratic Party of Morgan County. In 1862 he and his wife built the house, only to sell it later that year to Israel Gilpin, who operated one of Martinsville's first industries, a wool mill complementing the previous Martinsville industries of pork packing and shipping.
In 1870 the Gilpins sold the house to a farmer named John Buckner, who in turn sold it in 1889 to the Clapper family who held it until 1926. Car dealers Howard and Doris Daily owned it from 1926 to 1930, losing it due to Howard wagering it in a poker game. It then moved to the Sedwick family until 1945, when it was sold back to Doris Daily. Since Daily's death, it has changed ownership thrice, most recently in 2007.
The Crawford-Gilpin House is a two-story brick and limestone Italianate structure on a brick foundation. A carriage house built with the house also still stands. The Morgan County Historical Preservation Society has awarded the current owners a grant for fixing storm shutters and porch trim.

DeForest Skinner House

The DeForest Skinner House or Skinner Homestead, is a place on the National Register of Historic Places in Valparaiso, Indiana. It was placed on the Register on June 24, 2008. Built around 1860, it is a two-story carpentered Italianate structure with a double brick foundation, weatherboard walls, and asphalt roof, located three blocks north of the Porter County Courthouse. The register listing includes a carriage stepping stone by the north porch, with the family name upon it.
DeForest Skinner acquired the recently built house around the time he married Rachel Ann Maxwell in 1861. Skinner had arrived in Valparaiso in 1847 at age eleven with his parents John and Emily Skinner; he displayed business acumen early in life as he worked for various commercial interests. From 1874 to 1878, as a member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the Indiana Senate. Then in 1880 and 1888 he represented his area at the Democratic National Conventions. He also served as the President of the First National Bank from 1887 until his death in 1902. He was also Indiana's representative at the World's Congress of Bankers in 1893. Furthermore, he was on the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railroad's board of directors. His death in 1902 occurred in the house.
Upon Skinner's death, the house was under control of his son Leslie Reid Skinner, born in 1873. Leslie became the railroad's director after his father's death, making him the youngest railroad director in the United States. Leslie and his wife sold the house in 1919 to Louis Szold, who lived in the house until 1946. Szold started renting out the house in 1930, and subsequent owners continued to use the house as apartments until December 2005, when current owners Kirk and Caroline Conner began renovating the house.

Battle of Beledweyne (2008)

The July 2008 Battle of Beledweyne began on July 1, 2008 when Islamic militants from the Somali Islamic Courts attacked the town of Beledweyne which was defended by a garrison of Ethiopian troops.
Background.
At the beginning of June 2008 Islamist forces started taking whole districts across central parts of Somalia. In the Bay region, northwest of Mogadishu, Al Shabaab insurgents entered the district of Qansah-Dheere on June 7, 2008, and took control without facing any resistance. Residents said there were no government troops present when the insurgents arrived.
On June 23, 2008, Islamist forces captured Bardale, entirely encircling Baidoa and cutting off the highway to Dolo. The next day Islamist forces establish control of Bardhere unopposed, signaling a definitive shift of Marehan clan affiliation solidly into the Islamist column. After that, on June 28, 2008, Islamist forces peacefully retook the strategic city of Beledweyne after the Ethiopian garrison withdraws from the area. Some looting of government facilities occurred, but Islamist commanders called on locals to return stolen property and uphold the peace. Some heavy fighting however did occur at the town of Guguriel, which is where the Ethiopians had withdrawn to after vacating Beledweyne.
The battle.
The fighting started July 1, 2008, when Somali opposition fighters ambushed an Ethiopian army convoy travelling from Guguriel in retreat toward the Ethiopian border. The fighting in the Mataban locality left 47 Ethiopian soldiers and 235 Islamist fighters dead. Three Ethiopian military vehicles were destroyed and two captured by the insurgents. 11 of the dead Ethiopians were senior and junior officers. Ethiopian troops withdrew to Ferfer across the border. As for the civilian casualties of the Mataban battle it was confirmed that a child was among those killed.
On July 3, 2008, Ethiopian troops commenced a counter-attack over the border against the insurgents in an attempt to retake Beledweyne. An Ethiopian column supported by tanks and artillery drove southeast from Ferfer and engaged Islamic Courts forces in Elgal in the mountainous northwestern outskirts of Beledweyn. The Ethiopian force pounded Islamist positions heavily with ballistic missiles.
Later in the day the Ethiopian force advanced to Jandkundisho, a suburb of Beledweyn, and continued to pound the hills surrounding Beledweyne, before digging into defensive positions outside Beledweyn.
The battle resumed on July 5, 2008 when the Islamist and Ethiopian forces clashed in Bur-Gabo, a village between Ferfer and Beledweyn. Sheikh Abdirahim Isse declared the Islamist forces to be victorious, having destroyed 4 Ethiopian military vehicles and "huge losses" of Ethiopian soldiers.
On July 6, 2008, the residents of Beledweyn fled the town as the Ethiopian Army began building up their forces in Jandkundisho, conceivably in preparations for an attack on Beledweyn itself.
On July 24, 2008, Ethiopian troops finally attacked the town. Seven civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded after artillery shells and bullets hit residential areas in Beledweyne as the troops moved in. Another seven civilians were shot dead near a bridge in the town by Ethiopian troops, who were returning fire after being attacked. Two more civilians were killed later in the day by shelling. By late that night most of the city had fallen into Ethiopian hands. However the Islamists were regrouping for a counter-attack. 16 civilians were dead by the end of the first day.
The next morning on July 25, 2008, fighting was still raging, as Islamist rebels sought to push out Ethiopian troops. At least 12 people were killed, including three civilians who died when an artillery shell hit their home on the western side of Beledweyne. Among the dead were at least three Ethiopian soldiers and four insurgents. This brought the toll in two days of fighting to 28 dead. The street battles finally died down by the end of the day with Ethiopian troops in control of the town.
The subsequent day saw Islamic Court Militants launch a massed counter-attack against Ethiopian positions in Beledweyne. Utilizing artillery support the UIC succeeded in recapturing a key bridge in the central part of the town. During this renewed fighting much of the Beledweyne civilian population fled from their homes.
Aftermath.
After the Ethiopians recaptured the northern part of the city fighting continued for months, with insurgents still in positions outside of the town.
There was a lull in the fighting, after the Ethiopian's victory, for the next three weeks until August 16, 2008, when insurgents attacked Ethiopian Army positions in the city which led to fighting that killed four Ethiopian soldiers and nine civilians.
On September 11, 2008, renewed fighting in the city killed one more Ethiopian soldier and three civilians.
By the end of November, under an agreement with the Islamists, Ethiopian troops finally withdrew from the city and returned into Ethiopia. Following their retreat an ICU-governing administration was formed in the town. According to reports by media observers, 39 insurgents were killed. Ethiopian leaders say that in fact, 50 of their soldiers and 71 insurgents died.

Boott Mills

The Boott Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts are an early American cotton mill, parts of which date to 1835. Their namesake is Kirk Boott, one of the early mill leaders in Lowell. Today, the Boott Mills complex is the most intact in Lowell.
Running off of hydropower, the original operation consisted of four gable-roofed brick mill buildings. Eventually, floors were added, giving them flat roofs, the buildings were connected by stair towers and clock towers, and other buildings were added to the complex as well. Steam power and electric power were eventually introduced.
The New England textile industry was in decline by World War I and collapsed after World War II; the Boott Mills ceased operations in 1958. In the late 1970s, they became a key component of the Lowell National Historical Park, largely because the complex stood virtually whole, unlike other complexes which had suffered fires, or selective or wholesale demolition, like the older Merrimack Manufacturing Company. Additionally, the Boott Mill still contains buildings dating from the 1830s, as well as containing new structures, dating closer to 1900. As such, it is a catalog of industrial development over that time period.
The Boott Mills are an excellent example of adaptive re-use; they contain the National Park weave room exhibit, condos, apartments, and offices. Renovations of certain buildings still continues. A single row of Mill girl housing, built for the early operatives under the Lowell System, still stands after an extensive renovation, and features exhibits as well.

United American Lines

United American Lines, the common name of the American Shipping and Commercial Corporation, was a shipping company founded by W. Averell Harriman in 1920. Intended as a way for Harriman to make his mark in the business world outside of his father, railroad magnate E. H. Harriman, the company was financed by the younger Harriman's mother, Mary Williamson Averell. Entering into the shipping world with little experience, Harriman's United American Lines entered into agreements with the Hamburg America Line ( or HAPAG), which was determined to recover after the financial disaster that befell the German company as a result of World War I.
After the brief and unsuccessful attempt at transatlantic service by the United States Mail Steamship Company (U.S. Mail Line) ended, Harriman's United American Line was temporarily assigned control over the former U.S. Mail Line ships in 1921. 
His inexperience taken advantage of by HAPAG and the almost complete end of immigration to the United States drained millions of dollars from the company and led Harriman to sell the company to HAPAG in 1926.

Bunting tosser

Bunting is now a commonplace term for any small decorative flags or streamers strung on a line, but its original etymology is more specific as the worsted cloth used for flags in the Navy.
The term doesn't appear in Covey Crump, although that's a far from infallible source.
Although a naval term, 'bunting tosser' is known across the services and may be used as a jocular insult amongst Army signallers, the implication being that the person addressed is only fit for the Navy.

<doc id="18274560" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18274560" title="Circle progression">
Circle progression

In music, the circle progression is a chord progression named for the circle of fifths, along which it travels. It is "undoubtedly the most common and the strongest of all harmonic progressions" and consists of "adjacent roots in ascending fourth or descending fifth relationship", with movement by ascending perfect fourth being equivalent to movement by descending perfect fifth due to inversion.
The circle progression is commonly a circle through the diatonic chords, chords of the diatonic scale, by fifths, including one progression by diminished fifth (in C: between F and B) and one diminished chord (in C: B):
Shorter common progressions may be derived by selecting certain specific chords from the series completing a circle from the tonic through all seven diatonic chords, such as the primary triads book-ending the progression:
The ii-V-I turnaround lies at the end of the circle progression, as does the vi-ii-V-I progression of root movement by descending fifths, which establishes tonality and also strengthens the key through the contrast of minor and major.
The circle progression may also contain dominant seventh chords.
I−vi−ii−V.
I−vi−ii−V is a very common "chord pattern" in jazz and popular styles of music. It is often used as a turnaround, occurring as the last to two bars of a chorus or section. I−vi−ii−V typically occurs as a two bar pattern in the A section of the rhythm changes.
In the jazz minor scale the diatonic progression
is possible (I-Δ7—vi-75—ii-7—V713).

Eric II, Duke of Pomerania

Eric II or Erich II (between 1418 and 1425 – 5 July 1474) was a member of the House of Pomerania (also known as the House of Griffins) and was the ruling Duke of Duke of Pomerania-Wolgast from 1457 to 1474. He was the son of Wartislaw IX of Pomerania-Wolgast and Sophia, daughter of Eric IV of Saxe-Lauenburg.
Life.
In 1451, Wartislaw IX arranged his son's marriage to Sophia, daughter of Bogislaw IX of Pomerania-Stolp and heiress of Eric I of Pomerania-Stolp, who had also been king of the Kalmar Union. The marriage of these distant relatives granted Eric II access to Eric I's lands in Farther Pomerania. Also, Eric I arranged the Lauenburg-Bütow Land at the Pomerelian border to be granted by the Polish king to Eric II on January 3, 1455, as a reward for aiding Poland in her struggles with the Teutonic Knights.
In 1456, Eric took over Maszewo Land in Farther Pomerania, despite Wassow being not included in his share of Pomerania. This led to conflicts with Otto III, Duke of Pomerania-Stettin and even Eric I. Even though the Pomeranian cities were able to mediate negotiations between the dukes which led to a compromise on January 16, 1457, at Rügenwalde, Eric lost the support of the other Pomeranian dukes with this action.
In August 1457, Eric was hunting in the forests near Horst, belonging not to his lands, but to the Hanseatic city of Greifswald. In further disrespect of the city's rights he ordered local peasants to aid him. Greifswald's mayor Heinrich Rubenow led the burghers of Greifswald and Stralsund in an attempt to arrest Eric. Although the burghers captured his guards, Eric managed to escape. Yet, by now he was not only opposed by his co-ruling Pomeranian dukes, but also by the Pomeranian cities.
After the death of his father, Wartislaw IX, later in 1457, Eric received Pomerania-Wolgast together with his younger brother, Wartislaw X. They split the duchy with Wartislaw X receiving the principality of Rügen (with Rügen, Barth, Tribsees and Grimmen) while Eric received the eastern parts. Upon Eric I's death, in 1459 Eric II gained Pomerania-Stolp and Pomerania-Rügenwalde due to the claims of his wife. Despite being a partitioned duchy in reality, Pomerania was granted to the dukes as one fief to be co-ruled, which meant that several issues had to be acted upon in common. Because Eric did not respect Wartislaw X's rights as a co-ruler, Wartislaw sought for an alliance with the Margraviate of Brandenburg on September 6, 1459, in Angermünde. He pawned the area north of the Brandenburgian Uckermark to Hohenzollern margrave Frederick II and in return became assured of military protection against his brother.
In 1464, Eric's cousin Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin died of the Black Death, leaving both Eric and Wartislaw as well as Brandenburg's Frederick II with claims for inheritance. In 1466 Eric II and Wartislaw X were granted liens by the elector of Brandenburg at Soldin. However the contract was not fulfilled and it came to military intervention. Aware that he would not withstand Brandenburg without allies, Eric sought to settle the conflict by allying with Poland and in 1470 invaded the Brandenburg Neumark. The Brandenburgers had their longtime claims to Pomerania re-verified by emperor Frederick III. The emperor ordered Erich II and Wartislaw X to recognize the suzerainty of Brandenburg. Mecklenburgs Duke Henry took a mediator role and the Mecklenburgian army moved eastward following the Tollense River, a Brandenburgian army advanced to the North from the Uckermark following the Randow River. The campaigns were ended by the Peace of Prenzlau of May 31, 1472 and the Pomeranian dukes gave the pledge of allegiance to the elector. Brandenburg was again granted the right of inheritance of Pomerania upon the extinction of the House of Pomerania.
Eric died in 1474 of a plague-like disease. He was buried in Eldena Abbey near Greifswald and was succeeded by his son Bogislaw X.
Marriage and issue.
Eric II married Sophia of Pomerania-Stolp. With his wife, he had nine children:

The Hub, formerly known as the UF Bookstore, is a historic building on Stadium Road between Buckman Drive and Fletcher Drive on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, Florida in the United States. On June 24, 2008, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Built in 1949-1950 and designed by Andrew Ferendino of the Miami architectural firm of Russell T. Pancoast and Associates, as directed by Florida Board of Control architect Guy Fulton and UF's consulting architect Jefferson Hamilton, it was UF's first departure from the Collegiate Gothic architectural style that had prevailed on the campus since the first buildings, Buckman and Thomas, were built in 1905. It originally housed the campus bookstore, post office, barber shop, soda fountain, and movie theater. 
Prior to moving to the J. Wayne Reitz Union in 2003, the university's bookstore and ID card services were both located at The Hub. A small food court was set up on the first floor and the "Technology Hub" selling computer accessories and software was on the second floor.
The Hub underwent a $10.8 million renovation, reopening in April 2007. The renovation added various computer and videoconferencing equipment, a open wireless Internet area, a Starbucks, and group and individual study rooms. The Office of Academic Technology and the International Center (study abroad) moved to the Hub following the renovation. [http://news.ufl.edu/2007/04/17/open-house-marks-reopening-of-hub/]

Lifeline (Iris DeMent album)

Lifeline is the fourth album released by singer-songwriter Iris DeMent, released in 2004, eight years since her previous recording "The Way I Should".
History.
"Lifeline" contains many traditional Protestant gospel songs DeMent describes as finding comfort in playing and singing. In her liner notes, DeMent recounts how her mother sang these songs in times of stress looking straight at the sky, "as if she were talking to someone."
DeMent's rendition of "Leaning on the Everlasting Arms" accompanies the closing credits of the Coen brothers' "True Grit" (2010).
Reception.
Tom Jurek of Allmusic writes: "... claims that for her, too, the music contained here became her lifeline through a season of hardship... While this is far from a full return to form for Dement, it is truly good to have her back." Music critic Robert Christgau wrote "Her heart cherishes Jesus' memory, but her mind, voice, and soul remain her own."

Gymnopodium is a section within the genus "Anthurium". It is composed of the extremely rare Cuban species "Anthurium gymnopus". Plants of this section are of somewhat scandent habit, with medium to long internodes, deciduous cataphylls, and somewhat leathery, suborbicular leaf blades. Other notable features include a long inflorescence with a stipitate spadix. The most notable feature is that mature berries contain up to four seeds, rather than the typical two.
The section is poorly studied, and with further genetic testing it may be absorbed into another.

Geoffrey de Rancon

Geoffrey de Rancon was a French army commander who lived in the 12th century. He served as Eleanor of Aquitaine's army commander during the Second Crusade. When the Crusaders, led by King Louis VII of France (Eleanor's consort) climbed Mount Cadmos, Rancon disobeyed orders and chose to march further than the spot chosen by the King for camp. He decided in concert with the Count of Maurienne (Louis´ uncle), that a nearby plateau would make a better camp, but such disobedience was reportedly common in the army, due to the lack of command from the King. As a result, the army was split and disorganized, and the Turks successfully ambushed a portion. The King narrowly escaped, and the blame for the massacre fell on Rancon.
King Louis sent Rancon home from the Crusade early, as a punishment. In the novel, "The Book of Eleanor", by Pamela Kaufman, he is renamed Richard of Rancon, and is Eleanor's lover. However, there is no historical evidence that this was in fact the case.
A descendent of Rancon was married to Isabelle, the daughter of Eleanor's daughter in law Isabella of Angoulême.

Yulee Area

Yulee Area (also known as the Yulee-Mallory-Reid Dormitory Complex) is a historic residence hall area at 13th Street and Inner Road, SW, on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, Florida in the United States. It is the site of the first permanent dormitories built for women after the campus became co-educational in 1947. On June 24, 2008, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Built in 1950, the four story Mallory, Reid and Yulee halls were designed by Florida Board of Control architect Guy Fulton in a simple, contemporary style in keeping with the board's mandate not to use the more expensive Collegiate Gothic architectural style that had prevailed on campus since its creation in 1905. Fulton, though, did manage to unify the new buildings with the older ones by using the same basic materials of "clay roof tiles, redbrick and stone or concrete trim." Mallory was named for Angela Mallory, wife of U.S. Senator and Confederate cabinet member Stephen Mallory, Reid was named for Mary Martha Reid, a prominent Confederate nurse during the American Civil War, and Yulee was named for Nancy Wycliffe Yulee, daughter of Kentucky Governor and U.S. Postmaster General Charles A. Wickliffe and wife of U.S. Senator David Levy Yulee. These were the first UF buildings to be named for women, albeit in two cases for women whose prominence was based mainly on that of their fathers or husbands.
Yulee Hall.
Yulee Hall, the flagship dormitory of the area, contains 94 rooms in single, double and triple style and can house 177 students. It is co-ed by floor. The Yulee area office is located on the first floor of the dorm.
Global Living Learning Community.
The hall is home to the Global Living Learning Community, a program designed to teach residents cultural awareness and keep them in touch with current global events while preparing them to be world leaders.
Mallory Hall.
Mallory Hall contains 91 rooms in single, double and triple style and can hold 175 students. It was the last remaining women-only hall until fall of 2004 when it became co-ed by floor.
Reid Hall.
Reid Hall contains 86 rooms in single, double and triple style and can house 166 students. It is co-ed by floor.
Fine Arts Living Learning Community.
Located across Inner Road from the College of Fine Arts, Reid is also home to the Fine Arts Living Learning Community, a program designed to nurture students in the visual and performing arts programs.

Bronx News

The Bronx News is a weekly newspaper that covers the entire Bronx. Founded in 1975, the Bronx News is known for its headlines and reporting. News stories range from crime, sports, entertainment and politics. The front page appears in color, but photos inside the newspaper appear in black and white.
In 1999, Bronx News received attention for its coverage of the Amadou Diallo shooting. Recently stories about the NYPD ban on the Bronx Puerto Rican Day festival and the Co-op City kickback scandal have received wider attention. 
In 2005, Bronx News revealed how officials at a Bronx charity, Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, had misappropriated funds from the charity and transferred some of the money to liberal radio network Air America Radio. A July 29, 2005 Washington Times article highlighted how the Bronx News covered the scandal ahead of the major media. Since the weekly did not have a Web site yet, some liberal bloggers questioned if the Bronx News really existed. By contrast, other Bronx newspapers such as the Bronx-Times Reporter, the Bronx Press-Review, and the Norwood News had established Web sites years earlier.
In April 2008, the Bronx News launched Bxnews.net (www.bxnews.net), a Web site devoted to bringing all the news of the Bronx to its readers. Bxnews.net provides breaking news as well as links to other sites and publications regarding the borough. Upon its launching founder and editor Dan Gesslein wanted to use the site's unlimited potential to showcase local unsigned talent including, rappers, singers, dancers and artists, the goal being to find the next JLo.
Bxnews.net posts news from the three newspapers that make up the Bronx group of Hagedorn Communications publications. 
In addition to the Bronx newspapers, Hagedorn Communications also publishes Real Estate Weekly, Brokers Weekly, El Vocero/US and Town & Village.
In 1993, Christopher Hagedorn, the Bronx News's publisher, was charged with falsifying circulation figures in order to get better postal rates.
Regular columnists.
In addition to covering news and publishing editorials, the Bronx News publishes several columns by former and current local writers. Mary V. Lauro, a member of the Wakefield Taxpayers and Civic League in the Bronx, writes "Wakefield Area News." Robert Press, a member of the Committee of One-Hundred Democrats, covers borough politics for "100 Percent." Father Robert Gorman, a Catholic priest and the chairman of Community Board 12 in the Bronx, writes about community issues for "Community Board News." Rich Mancuso and Vinny Iovieno have regular columns that cover professional, college, and high school sports. Mancuso occasionally writes about professional wrestling as well. Previous columnists have included: Anthony Rivieccio, who wrote about Personal Finance in "The Problem Solver" and "Financial Focus" and community events in "North Bronx Thinktank." The late Tony Rizzo wrote about politics. A conservative Republican, Rizzo became a sharp critic of Guy Velella, the borough's only Republican elected official and Bronx GOP chairman. Rizzo wrote for the paper until his death in 1995. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the late Joseph Savino, a Republican City Councilman-at-large in the Bronx, had his own column, "Where I Stand," about politics.
Feud with Congressman Eliot L. Engel.
Publisher Christopher Hagedorn has often used his Bronx newspapers to attack Bronx Democratic Congressman Eliot L. Engel, who was elected in 1988. Hagedorn believes that Engel, then an Assemblyman, was behind a failed effort in 1988 to evict the Co-op City News from its offices in Co-op City. Since 1988, Hagedorn has published numerous editorials and articles attacking Engel and even reprinted critical articles about him that have been published in other newspapers. Hagedorn has often endorsed Engel's opponents in the Democratic primary and the general election but the Congressman always won re-election to Congress. In 2000, Hagedorn intensified his campaign against Engel when the leadership of the powerful Bronx County Democratic organization decided to support former Assemblyman and City Councilman Larry Seabrook at the primary against Engel. Seabrook, whose campaign was plagued with problems, lost the primary to Engel by a wide margin.
In the last decade, Hagedorn's newspapers have mostly ignored Engel, but the two remain bitter enemies.

Bearforce 1

Bearforce 1 was a gay, dance music band from the Netherlands, known mainly for a YouTube hit video, "Bearforce 1." Founded in 2006 and promoting an image as bears (that is, hairy gay men), they released three singles accompanied by YouTube videos, they invited comparisons to the Village People and scored hits in the Netherlands before breaking up in 2009.
History.
Bearforce 1 was founded by three Dutchmen (Ian Turnel, Peter Johansson, and Yuri) and an Irishman (Robert Brown), led by actor and producer Roeland Fernhout. Their eponymous single "Bearforce 1," a medley of dance songs accompanied by a video clip in which the four bears dance and lip-sync, was a YouTube phenomenon and ended as #20 on LOGO TV's Ultimate Queer Videos Countdown. Praise by Perez Hilton led to a tour in the United States and attention in the US media--"The Washington Post" wrote of the band, "Finally, there's a boy band for older, hairy gay men." 
They released a second single, "Christmas is here," in 2007, also accompanied by a popular YouTube video (shot in the snow in Austria, in which the four men danced in red boxers, tank tops, ski outfits, and Santa Claus suits), The song entered the Single Top 100 at #7. In December 2007 they played a series of concerts in Ahoy Rotterdam with Gerard Joling, and in 2008 they played at the first same-sex marriage ceremony to take place at the Tilburg Pink Monday fair. A third single, "Shake That Thing," was again praised by Perez Hilton.
The same year, Johansson was replaced by Peter Gerrist. On Saturday 3 January 2009, Andrew Lloyd Webber and record company executive Colin Barlow dismissed an attempt by Bearforce 1 to represent the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 on BBC1's Your Country Needs You as "hopeless". The band broke up in late 2009.

Pan Am Flight 806

Pan Am Flight 806, operated by Pan American World Airways Boeing 707-321B N454PA ("Clipper Radiant"), was an international scheduled flight from Auckland, New Zealand to Los Angeles, California with intermediate stops at Pago Pago, American Samoa and Honolulu, Hawaii. On January 30, 1974 it crashed on approach to Pago Pago International Airport, killing 87 passengers and ten crew members.
Accident cause and description.
The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the crash was the flight crew's late recognition, and failure to correct in a timely manner, an excessive descent rate which developed as a result of the aircraft's penetration through destabilizing wind changes. The winds consisted of horizontal and vertical components produced by a heavy rainstorm and influenced by uneven terrain close to the aircraft's approach path. The captain's recognition was hampered by restricted visibility, the illusory effects of a "black hole" approach, inadequate monitoring of flight instruments, and the failure of the crew to call out descent rate during the last 15 seconds of flight.
The flight crew consisted of 52-year old Captain Leroy A. Petersen, 37-year old First Officer Richard V. Gaines, 43-year old Third Officer James S. Phillips, and 37-year old Flight Engineer Gerry W. Green.
All 10 crew members died, while 87 passengers ultimately died.
Nine passengers and one crew member survived the initial crash and post-accident fire. One passenger died the day after the accident. Three days after the accident, the remaining crew member and three passengers died. One passenger counted as a survivor by NTSB died nine days after the accident.

<doc id="18275564" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18275564" title="The Goldberg Variation (The X-Files)">
The Goldberg Variation (The X-Files)

"The Goldberg Variation" is the sixth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on December 12, 1999. It was written by Jeffrey Bell, directed by Thomas J. Wright, and featured guest appearances by Willie Garson and Shia LaBeouf. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. "The Goldberg Variation" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.8, being watched by 14.49 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a mysterious man named Henry Weems, who appears to be the luckiest man in the world. The title is a dual reference to Rube Goldberg machines and the "Goldberg Variations" by Johann Sebastian Bach.
Bell's original draft of the episode opened with a man falling thirty-thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unharmed. Due to budgetary reasons, the intro was later changed to a man falling out of a building. Willie Garson—who had appeared in the third season episode "The Walk"—was cast as Henry Weems, breaking a "long-standing rule" on the show to not recast previous actors. The first cut of the episode was four minutes under-time, and so various insert shots and new scenes had to be filmed in order to compensate.
Plot.
A man by the name of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona attempts to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of a building. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry 
The agents track down Weems, a handyman at an apartment building. He refuses to testify against Cutrona. Weems has a fascination with Rube Goldberg Machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Mulder agrees with Scully concluding that his luck "is" the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in an improbable cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom, he accidentally shoots a lamp that knocks over an ironing board, then trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Weems notes he was also the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.
Weems picks up a lottery ticket and wins $100,000 but learns that it would take 12 months to get the money, so he throws the ticket away. A man picks the ticket out of the trash and is then hit by a truck after Weems warned him that "something bad will happen." Later, Mulder comes to question Weems again and another one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but his bullet ricochets off Weems' pocket knife and kills the enforcer. Weems confesses that he's been trying to find a way to get $100,000 to pay for an expensive medical treatment for the serious illness of a boy in his apartment building, Richie (Shia LaBeouf), has. Weems attempts at getting the money, however, have brought him above the radar. Later, after Weems is hit by a car, it appears that Henry's lucky streak has reached its end. Cutrona kidnaps Richie's mom, Maggie, to stop Henry from testifying against him. Henry is also taken but all the mobsters are killed in a bizarre turn of events. In the end, it turns out that Cutrona is an organ donor and a perfect match for Richie, who gets the treatment.
Production.
Writing.
The episode's title is a pun. It refers to both cartoonist Rube Goldberg, who was famous for his drawings of incredibly complex machines made out of everyday objects that performed rudimentary tasks, as well as the harpsichord piece, the "Goldberg Variations", by Johann Sebastian Bach. The elaborate contraptions Henry Weems created are physical examples of such machines. Episode writer Jeffrey Bell noted that he wanted the episode to function "as a Rube Goldberg device" and so he wrote the story to revolve around the ideas of good luck and bad luck. Originally, the episode's opening scene was to have featured Weems falling thirty thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unscathed. Although Bell's pitch was met with enthusiasm, many writers and producers for the show were cautious, because they realized the episode would have several humorous moments. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained: "The episode had a lot of humorous moments that we were afraid of doing because as many people who like the funny ones hate the funny ones." Eventually, the episode was green-lighted, but pushed to later in the season because, according to Spotnitz, "we wanted to scare the hell out of everybody during the first few episodes."
Bell began crafting his script, adding a mafia-related sub-plot and replacing the airplane drop with a fall from a building, for budgetary reasons. The biggest hurdle for the episode, however, was crafting the Rube Goldberg machine. However, because Bell had "extra time" to write his script, the art department was given a head start on crafting the contraption. Gillian Anderson later explained that working with the machines required a lot of patience, because multiple takes had to be filmed in order to make sure everything went as planned. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, broke a "long-standing rule" on the show and re-cast Willie Garson—who had appeared in the third season episode "The Walk"—as Henry Weems. Millikan noted that Garson was "literally the best person for the job."
Post-production.
After the episode was finished filming, the footage entered into a long period of editing. Series creator Chris Carter noted that the episode "wasn't cutting together well and that there were things that just didn't work." Eventually the resultant footage was reworked into an acceptable manner when suddenly the series ran into another problem: the episode was four minutes under time. In order to compensate for this, additional inserts of the Rube Goldberg Machine were filmed as well as a scene featuring Mulder and Scully discussing the episode's backstory. The latter, which was filmed several months after the rest of the episode, required Anderson to wear a wig because her hair style had substantially changed.
When the episode was finally finished and aired, it was highly enjoyed by "The X-Files" cast and crew. Carter called the entry "tight, funny, touching, and quirky." Series writer Vince Gilligan was impressed with the episode, and noted that the episode represented the seventh season of the show as whole. He explained: "The seventh season, for my money, was one of our best because we took more storytelling risks than in previous years."
Broadcast and reception.
"The Goldberg Variation" first aired in the United States on December 12, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 8.8, with a 13 share, meaning that roughly 8.8 percent of all television-equipped households, and 13 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 14.49 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 23, 2000 and received 0.78 million viewers, making it the fifth most watched episode that week.
The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode "The Rain King" and noted that "'The Rain King' by Jeff Bell was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly came as a surprise to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" entry for seven. It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the "finest stand-alone episode" of Season Seven and wrote, "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a "charmer" and praised Willie Garvin's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" awarded the episode a "B+" and called it a "fun" entry that shows off the series' "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a "clever and whimsical" feel, but that the conceit of a "good man" as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it "all works out in the end".
Other reviews were more mixed. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and noted that despite the episode being "Funny stuff," it was ultimately "a little uneven overall." Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode three stars out of five. Despite calling the episode "a likeable piece of work", the two explained that the story itself was fine, but that the episode's set piece did not work with the plot. Shearman and Pearson, however, ultimately concluded that the premise was "such a well-meaning little bauble that you want to applaud it for its intent if nothing else."

Amalia (novel)

Amalia is a 19th-century political novel written by the exiled Argentine author José Marmol. First published serially in the Montevideo weekly, "Amalia" (1851) became Argentina's national novel. Along with Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo, "Amalia" can be seen as an early precursor to the Latin American dictator novel through its strong criticism of caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, who ruled Argentina with a strong fist from 1829 to 1852.
Set in post-colonial Buenos Aires, "Amalia" was written in two parts and is a semi-autobiographical account of José Mármol that deals with living in Rosas's police state. Mármol's novel was important as it showed how the human consciousness, much like a city or even a country, could become a terrifying prison. "Amalia" also attempted to examine the problem of dictatorships as being one of structure, and therefore the problem of the state "manifested through the will of some monstrous personage violating the ordinary individual's privacy, both of home and of consciousness."

Richard Borden

Colonel Richard Borden (1795–1874) was an American businessman and civic leader from Fall River, Massachusetts. He co-founded the Fall River Iron Works in 1821, and later built several early cotton mills, as well as the Fall River Line, Fall River Gas Works Company, the Fall River Railroad, banks and other businesses. The Borden family would dominate the economic and civic life of Fall River into the early 20th century.
Early life.
When the Town of Fall River was established in 1803, the Borden family had been well established in the area for over a century. In 1714, Colonel Richard's ancestor (also named Richard) purchased land along the falls of the Quequechan River from Benjamin Church, along with a saw mill, a grist mill and a fulling mill. Eventually the Borden family would acquire the water rights of the entire Quequechan River valley, and its tremendous potential.
Borden began working in a grist mill at age fifteen. Most of the area's corn was ground at his mill. He became adept in the task of sailing and boating in the Narragansett Bay, as part of the grist mill business. He also operated a saw mill adjacent to the grist mill during these years.
Borden acquired the rank of "colonel" in the local militia in 1828.
In 1828, Borden married Abby Walker Durfee. Together they had seven children; two daughters and five sons. Three of their sons would continue in their father's footsteps and become involved in the Fall River textile business; Thomas James Borden (1832–1902), Richard Baxter Borden (1834–1906) and Matthew Challoner Durfee Borden (1842–1912).
Industrial pioneer.
In 1821, Borden established the Fall River Iron Works, along with Major Bradford Durfee, and several others at the lower part of the Quequechan River. Bradford Durfee was a shipwright, and Richard Borden was the owner of a grist mill. After an uncertain start, in which some early investors pulled out, the Fall River Iron Works was incorporated in 1825, with $200,000 in capital. The Iron Works began producing nails, bar stock, and other items such as bands for casks in the nearby New Bedford whaling industry. They soon gained a reputation for producing nails of high quality, and business flourished. By 1845, the company was valued at $960,000. In 1827, Borden began regular steamship service to Providence, Rhode Island.
The Iron Works would continue play an important role in the early development of the textile industry in Fall River. Richard Borden later constructed the Metacomet Mill in 1847, which today is the oldest remaining textile mill in the City, located on Anawan Street.
Other businesses.
Borden also established the first railroad line to serve Fall River, The Fall River Branch Railroad, was incorporated in 1844 and opened in 1845 to Myricks Junction, with a connection over the to Boston via Mansfield via the Taunton Branch Railroad. However, wanting a more direct route to Boston, Borden opened a new line in 1846 connecting with the Old Colony Railroad at South Braintree via Middleborough and Bridgewater. The Fall River Branch Railroad was merged with the Middleborough Railroad Corporation and the Randolph & Bridgewater Railroad Corporation to become the Fall River Railroad Company.
In 1847, regular steamship service to New York City began as the Bay State Steamboat Company, later known as the Fall River Line. It was America's most luxurious steamship line connecting rail travelers from Boston to Manhattan. It would operate until 1937.
Legacy.
Three of Richard Borden's sons would carry on their father's tradition in the family's businesses. In 1871, his eldest son, Colonel Thomas James Borden (1832–1902) would build the Richard Borden Mill, as a tribute to his father, and succeed his uncle Jefferson as agent of the Print Works, as well as numerous other concerns.
Richard Baxter Borden (1834–1906) would serve as either president, director and treasurer of several mills, banks and insurance companies.
Matthew C.D. Borden (1842–1912) would eventually take over the American Printing Company in 1887.

Small market

In the terminology of professional sports in North America, teams are often said to be based not in a city but in a media market. The size of the media market is usually a good indication of the potential viability of a major league team. A small market team is likely to struggle to compete financially against teams from larger markets and may therefore also be outbid in the competition for top talent. This has led to calls for revenue sharing, luxury taxes, and / or salary caps is most North American sports leagues in order to ensure competitive balance or parity.

Columbus Monument, Barcelona

The Columbus Monument (, ; ) is a tall monument to Christopher Columbus at the lower end of La Rambla, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was constructed for the Exposición Universal de Barcelona (1888) in honor to Columbus first voyage to the Americas. The monument serves as a reminder that Christopher Columbus reported to Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand V in Barcelona after his first trip to the new continent.
Description.
Statue and Column.
At the very top of the monument stands a tall bronze statue atop a tall Corinthian column. The statue was sculpted by Rafael Atché and is said to depict Columbus pointing towards the New World with his right hand, while holding a scroll in the left. It is a commonly held belief that instead of pointing to the west towards the New World, the statue points east towards Columbus's supposed home city of Genoa. This, however, is not true, as the statue points south-southeast (a more southerly direction than the adjacent Rambla Del Mar and almost a perfect extension of the direction of La Rambla, Barcelona) and in effect is pointing at a point somewhere near the city of Constantine, Algeria. To point at Genoa in northern Italy the statue would have to face east-northeast and point up the coastline. It is more likely that the statue is situated in the current way simply to have Columbus point out to sea underscoring his achievements in naval exploration. The statue is atop a socle, on which the word "Tierra" (land) is inscribed.
Pedestal.
The column, hung with a device bearing an anchor, stands on an octagonal pedestal from which four bronze winged victories or Phemes take flight towards the four corners of the world, above paired griffins. Four buttresses against the octagonal pedestal bear portrait medallions that depict persons related to Columbus:
Seated against the buttresses are four figures that represent the four realms of Spain: the Principality of Catalonia, and the kingdoms of León, Aragon, and Castile. 
Against the base of the pedestal between the buttresses are four additional statues:
An elevator inside the column takes visitors up to a viewing platform at the top (just below the socle).
Plinth.
The canted octagonal plinth is inset with eight bronze bas-relief panels that depict important scenes in Columbus's first voyage to the Americas:
Alternating with the bas-reliefs are eight coats-of-arms representing locations that Columbus visited:
Base.
The base of the monument is a wide circle, with four staircases. Each staircase is flanked by two lions.
Construction.
The idea of a monument to Columbus came in 1856 from Antoni Fages i Ferrer, who proposed that it be constructed entirely by Catalans, but he got nowhere with his plan for sixteen years. Finally in 1872 he gained the support of the mayor of the city, Francesc Rius i Taulet, and in 1881 the city passed a resolution to build the monument. A contest was held exclusively for Spanish artists to submit their designs with the winner being Gaietà Buigas i Monravà, a Catalan. Most of the money was privately raised, with only twelve percent being financed with public funds. All of the funding came from Spanish sources and the entire construction (labour and materials) was done by Catalans. Construction began in 1882 and was completed in 1888 in time for the Exposición Universal de Barcelona.
Other versions.
Copies of the monument can be found in L'Arboç (Tarragona, Catalonia; statue only), Shima Spanish Village (Shima, Mie, Japan), Maspalomas (Gran Canaria, Spain), and miniature versions at the Catalunya en Miniatura park and at the Mini-Europe park (Brussels, Belgium).

Mammals and Birds Excluder Device

A Mammals and Birds Excluder Device or MBED (also named Cachalotera) is a fishing gear device that avoids the depredation of the fish caught in the line for Marine Mammals, and avoids the entanglement of seabirds when is setting the line and hauling. This device was designed mainly for the interactions with toothed whales: Sperm Whales and Killer Whales. 
Mechanism.
The Mammals and Birds Excluder Device (MBED) consists in a modification to the traditional Spanish bottom longline used in the fishery of Patagonian toothfish ("Dissostichus eleginoides"). Several configurations are in use depending on the country, and fishermen. The first descriptions were issued in Chile and Uruguay, starting the tests in 2006. 
The main bottom longline is set in a simple way with a main line rigging from which many secondary or branch lines are hanging, of about 12 to 15 m long. On each of these lines, a cone-shaped device or protection net is placed in each secondary line, made by two metallic rings on the edge covered by a mesh net: the upper ring of 20 cm of diameter consisting in encased wire ending in retention rigging; and a lower ring of 100 cm diameter, with a separation distance between both rings of 180 cm. The mesh net composing the device is 7.5 cm, and on the upper ring, it ends in a knot allowing movement through the branch lines. Such branch lines are separated from 55 m to 70 m between them, and may be set in variable styles according to the hauling speed. One set contains 6 hooks, and such sets are prepared on the basis of 4 per box. This device as a whole has less density than the end weights (5 to 10 kg) and consequently, it rises up to the retention when hauling, and the hooks are uncovered when it reaches the bottom. When the longline is hauled back, the cone-shaped device is moved to the lower part of the branch lines, covering the hooks and consequently protecting the catch. The hooks are rigged in a piece divided into two bunches of 6 hooks each, being the main piece of 170 cm long and a diameter of 6 mm, and the two bunches are separated at 50 cm one from the other, the secondary lines (12 per piece) are 30 cm long and made of 4 mm diameter multifilament lines.
History.
First tests were carried out in 2006 in Chile and Uruguay in the longline fisherie of Toothfish ("D. eleginoides") in the case of Uruguay the main assessment were carried out in the FV Banzare operating in two different fishing areas at 40° and 50° latitudes in the Southwestern Atlantic from March to May 2007. The development of this fishing gear was monitored by Fisheries observers on board in all the cases
Achievements.
In all the cases, the incidental capture of birds registered was absolute: no bird was captured when the MBED was used on the fishing gear, no marine bird mortalities were due to gear captures during this study. 
The MBED works in two aspects:

Downham, Lancashire

Downham is a village and civil parish in Lancashire, England. It is in the Ribble Valley district and as of the United Kingdom 2001 census has a population of 156. The village is on the north side of Pendle Hill off the A59 road about from Clitheroe.
The manor was originally granted to the de Dinelay family in the fourteenth century by Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. It ceased to be a part of the Honour of Clitheroe in 1558 when it was purchased by the Assheton family. It still remains in Assheton ownership today but was reincorporated into the Honour of Clitheroe in 1945 when Ralph Assheton, later 1st Baron Clitheroe, bought the remnants of the Honour from the administrators of the Clitheroe Estate Company.
The 2nd Lord Clitheroe does not allow overhead electricity lines, aerials or satellite dishes, making the village a popular location for filming period dramas. Downham was one of the locations used in the 1961 film "Whistle Down the Wind", and the BBC One series "Born and Bred", set in the fictional village of Ormston, was also filmed in the village. The 2012 BBC drama "The Secret Of Crickley Hall" was also filmed in and around Downham.

U.S. Route 6 in Utah

U.S. Route 6 (US-6) is a major east–west state highway through the central part of the U.S. state of Utah. Although it is about longer than US-50, it serves more populated areas, and in fact follows what had been US-50's routing until it was moved to follow Interstate 70 (I-70) in 1976. In 2009, the Utah State Legislature named part of the route the "Mike Dmitrich Highway", which generated controversy, as the state of Utah had previously joined with all the other states through which US-6 passes in naming all of US-6 the Grand Army of the Republic highway.
Route description.
US-6 enters Utah overlapped with US-50 in the Great Basin, a large desert that includes much of western Utah. As part of the Basin and Range Province, the terrain alternates between north–south oriented flat valleys and mountain ranges. US-6 and US-50 cross the Snake Valley, Confusion Range (through Kings Canyon), Tule Valley, House Range (via Skull Rock Pass), and Pahvant Valley (passing north of Sevier Lake), finally reaching the town of Hinckley just before they split in Delta. US-6 turns to the northeast at that city, paralleling the Union Pacific Railroad's Lynndyl Subdivision to the west of the Canyon Mountains, Gilson Mountains, and East Tintic Mountains—three ranges that form the eastern boundary of the Basin and Range Province.
At Tintic Junction, the intersection with SR-36 in the Tintic Valley, US-6 turns east and ascends the East Tintic Mountains. It passes through the mining city of Eureka as it climbs to The Summit, before descending through Homansville Canyon into the Goshen Valley. Although it left behind the UP rail line at Tintic Junction, this part of US-6 parallels the former Tintic Branch of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, which has been partially abandoned. After passing through Goshen, the highway curves around the north side of Warm Springs Mountain and into the Utah Valley, where it enters Santaquin. On the east side of that city, US-6 begins an overlap with I-15, while the old alignment—SR-198—continues straight through Payson and Salem. After about together in the Utah Valley, US-6 and I-15 separate in Spanish Fork, the latter turning southeast onto a short two-lane expressway. SR-198 rejoins US-6 on the eastern outskirts of Spanish Fork, and soon thereafter US-89 joins at Moark Junction. The two routes—US-6 and US-89—begin an overlap here that extends through the Spanish Fork Canyon, alongside the UP Provo Subdivision (ex-D&RGW), to Thistle in the Wasatch Range. The remainder of US-6 to the Colorado state line parallels this rail line (which becomes the Green River Subdivision at Helper).
US-6 continues alone through the Spanish Fork Canyon, now alongside Soldier Creek, to Soldier Summit on the Wasatch Plateau, where it finally leaves the Great Basin into the watershed of the Colorado River. It begins to descend by following the White River, which empties into the Price River near Colton. The Price River takes US-6 down through the Price Canyon, the west edge of the Book Cliffs, joining US-191 at Castle Gate. The land flattens and opens out at Helper, named for the helper locomotives needed to carry trains up to Soldier Summit, and US-6 continues southeasterly around Price on a two-lane freeway bypass, with the old alignment marked as both a business route and SR-55. Relatively flat land continues as US-6 parallels the Book Cliffs to the southwest and west, crossing the Price River at Woodside. West of Green River, US-6 joins I-70/US-50, which it overlaps for the remainder of its stay in Utah. Now south of the Book Cliffs, the four routes head east to Crescent Junction, where US-191 splits to the south. As it begins to approach the Colorado River, the highway curves northeasterly through the Grand Valley and into Colorado.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were 519 fatal and serious injury crashes between Spanish Fork and Green River in Utah from 1996–2008, leading the stretch to be considered one of the deadliest roads in the U.S.
US-6 forms an arch-shaped route with Spanish Fork at the apex. The western half of the arch is the road less traveled, passing through the Great Basin desert, Sevier Lake, Delta, Eureka and the Tintic Standard Reduction Mill.
The eastern half is a popular transportation corridor, paralleling the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad's transcontinental line. This half passes over Soldier Summit and the historic railroad hub of Helper.
Starting in the spring of 1983, US-6 was a discontinuous route for almost one year, due to a massive landslide that destroyed the town of Thistle. During this time traffic was routed on two detours. One, via Salina, Utah, was over long and took traffic almost 100 aerial miles from the route of US-6. The other, via Duchesne, Utah, was shorter. However, this detour traversed steep grades and was not recommended for trucks. The night before the rebuilt US-6 opened, the highway stubs at either side of the landslide were filled with tens of miles of trucks, the drivers tired of the lost revenue from the long detours. The landslide remains the most costly in the history of the United States. Two rest areas along US-6 pay tribute to the residents of the town who lost everything.
US-6 in Utah passes through or by several ghost towns including Tintic, Thistle, Tucker, Soldier Summit, Colton, Woodside and Cisco. Most of these towns were either mining or railroad based.
The section of US-6 between Spanish Fork and Price is considered one of the deadliest stretches of highway in the United States. A high volume of trucks and automobiles travel that stretch at interstate speeds, along hairpin turns, through narrow canyons.
History.
US-6 did not enter Utah until 1936, when it was extended west from Greeley, Colorado to Long Beach, California. The eastern half in Utah, from Colorado to Spanish Fork, overlapped US-50, but after a short segment on US-91 to Santaquin, it followed a route that was new to the U.S. Highway system into Nevada. This road was not yet built to good standards; while it was improved to Hinckley, the remainder across the desert was a graded earth road. It was not paved all the way until 1952, when a new alignment was completed from Hinckley into Nevada; within a few years, US-50 was moved from a long overlap with US-40 (now I-80) south to the new road, completely overlapping US-6 through Utah. US-50 was moved farther south in 1976, due to the completion of I-70 across the San Rafael Swell, separating the two routes between Delta and Green River.
Utah Valley to Colorado.
The road from SR-1 (US-91 by 1926, now US-89) in Spanish Fork southeast via Price and Green River to the Colorado state line became a state highway in 1912, with the final section - Spanish Fork to Colton - being added in May. However, the original route was somewhat longer than present-day US-6, most notably between Price and Green River, where travelers went south from Price to Castle Dale via present SR-10 and then east to Green River via what are now county roads north of the San Rafael River (partly along an old never-used Denver and Rio Grande Railroad grade). Other differences included going southeast from Green River to Valley City and northeast to Thompsons. New construction through Price Canyon between Kyune and Castle Gate was made easier by the presence of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in the canyon. Later that year, the Midland Trail Association was organized in Grand Junction, Colorado to promote a transcontinental auto trail that would include this road.
A 1913 law provided state aid to counties to construct the Midland Trail, with a general route defined. Initially it was to follow the present US-6 via Woodside between Price and Green River, but an amendment changed it to the existing state road through Buckhorn Flat (east of Castle Dale). Travelers began using the Midland Trail through eastern Utah in early July 1913, and the road through Price Canyon, replacing a detour via Willow Creek Canyon (US-191) and Emma Park, was completed by the men of Price later that month. A.L. Westgard of the National Highways Association praised the improvements to the road since the previous year, singling out the Price Canyon segment as "almost beyond comprehension". Although it was hoped that it would become part of the Lincoln Highway, the high mountain passes in Colorado convinced that association to designate a route farther north through Wyoming in September 1913. Midland Trail promoters were not discouraged; instead they were determined to continue to improve to the route to make it better than the Lincoln Highway.
The shorter route via Woodside rather than Castle Dale was considered again in 1916, due to problems with maintaining the latter and a new bridge over the Price River at Woodside, and it was adopted as a state road in April. The piece northwest of Sunnyside Junction had already been designated as part of a state road to Sunnyside, the rest of which still exists as SR-123. A cutoff from Springville south to Moark Junction via Mapleton was also added that year.
A 1919 law redefined the state highway system to include only a short list of roads and any federal aid projects. At the urging of Grand County, the route that corresponded to the Midland Trail was realigned to the longer but more scenic road along the Colorado River between Moab and Cisco, including the new Dewey Bridge. In response to a Carbon County request, the law also removed Price Canyon from the route, instead taking it along the older road through Willow Creek Canyon and Emma Park. Finally, the older route from Spanish Fork to Moark Junction was dropped in favor of the 1916 addition from Springville. Four years later, both counties had changed their minds, and the legislature changed the route back. The Moab-Cisco River Road was entirely dropped (though it was redesignated in the early 1930s as SR-128), but both the Price Canyon and Emma Park routes remained. Also that year, the Bureau of Public Roads approved Utah's seven percent federal-aid system in accordance with the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921, including the Springville-Colorado segment of the Midland Trail.
In the 1920s, the State Road Commission numbered the Springville-Colorado roadway as State Route 8. Several years later, in 1926, it also became part of U.S. Route 50, which continued east to Annapolis, Maryland (west of Thistle, the road was initially not part of US-50; instead it was the north end of US-89, which ended at Spanish Fork, leaving the Moark Junction-Springville road as simply SR-8). The legislature officially adopted the SR-8 designation in 1927, dropping the Emma Park alternate, and designating two other roads as SR-8: the Spanish Fork-Moark Junction road, which had been dropped in 1919, and a branch from Soldier Creek Junction northeast via Nine Mile Canyon to Myton, which had been part of the 1919 system. The Myton spur was split off in 1931 as SR-53, and the Spanish Fork spur became SR-105 in 1945.
The state completely reconstructed US-50 east of Spanish Fork in 1930 and 1931, eliminating most curves and railroad grade crossings, and shortening it by .
Utah Valley to Nevada.
The Grand Central Highway was the local name for the road beginning at the Lincoln Highway in Ely, Nevada and running east and northeast through Delta and Eureka to the Arrowhead Trail in Santaquin. Due to its avoidance of the Great Salt Lake Desert that the Lincoln Highway passed through, Ely garage owners were promoting it as the best route to Salt Lake City by May 1921. For the same reason - long stretches of desert - Grand Central Highway promoters believed it to be superior to the Arrowhead Trail for Los Angeles-bound travelers. The Eureka Commercial Club posted a billboard in Santaquin in July, advertising the "shortest and best all year route to California". The Midland Trail Association, whose trail followed the Lincoln Highway's route between Salt Lake City and Ely, adopted the Grand Central as an official alternate route in June 1922. The next year, the state legislature added the road from Santaquin to Silver City (southwest of Eureka) to the state highway system, and in 1925 it was extended to Delta. Along with the road southeast from Delta to Holden, this was designated State Route 26 in 1927, and at the same time the road west from Delta to Nevada was added to the system as State Route 27. (The portion in Nevada became SR 14 in 1925.)
In 1925, during early U.S. Highway system planning, the Grand Central Highway was designated as U.S. Route 50's path across western Utah. However, when the final plan was approved in late 1926, US-50 had a gap between Ely and Thistle. The gap was filled in about 1930 - but via the Wendover Cutoff, far to the north, leaving the Grand Central Highway as only SR-26 and SR-27. The road again received attention in 1932, when the Roosevelt Highway Association was looking for a path for a westward extension of its trail - which had survived the 1920s by being identified with U.S. Route 6 - from Greeley, Colorado to the West Coast. The association tentatively approved a route in April, entering Utah via US-50 to the Utah Valley, and leaving via the Grand Central Highway to Ely. The Delta Lions Club had suggested this alignment for the same reasons that the highway had become popular in the 1920s: cooler weather than the Arrowhead Trail (then US-91). Despite the State Road Commission designating US-40 across the state as the Roosevelt Highway in 1935, the final route, approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials as US-6 in December 1936, followed US-50 and the Grand Central Highway.
However, the designation did not mean that the road would be immediately improved. It was not until September 1952 that paving was completed west of Delta, largely on a new alignment south of the old road. "Business Week" described the original route as "nothing but a wagon trail-rutted, filled with dust...one of the worst chunks of federal road in the country." A two day celebration was held in Delta to mark the occasion.
Dividend was bypassed by a new route through Homansville Canyon in about 1931, and the old route (Dividend Road) initially became a branch of SR-26. It was renumbered State Route 159 in 1945 and deleted from the state highway system in 1969.

Andrew Schlafly

Andrew Layton "Andy" Schlafly (born April 27, 1961) is an American lawyer, conservative activist, and homeschool teacher, best known as the founder and owner of the wiki Conservapedia. He is the son of conservative activist and lawyer Phyllis Schlafly.
Schlafly was the lead counsel for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons' efforts to bring the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before the United States Supreme Court.
Early life, education, and career.
Schlafly is one of the six children of John Fred Schlafly, Jr. and Phyllis Schlafly, residents of Alton, Illinois. John Fred Schlafly, Jr.'s grandfather August was a Swiss immigrant to the United States. John Fred Schlafly was an attorney, and Phyllis Schlafly founded the Eagle Forum and spearheaded the movement opposing the Equal Rights Amendment. Andrew Schlafly received a B.S.E. in electrical engineering and certificate in engineering physics from Princeton University in 1981. After graduating from Princeton, Schlafly worked as a device physicist for Intel in Santa Clara, California until 1983, when he became a microelectronics engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In 1984, Schlafly married Catherine Kosarek, a medical student and fellow Princeton alum. Schlafly later worked for Bell Labs before enrolling at Harvard Law School.
Schlafly graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991 with a J.D. in the same class with future U.S. president Barack Obama. From 1989 to 1991, Schlafly was an editor of the "Harvard Law Review". After graduating from Harvard, Schlafly served as an adjunct professor at Seton Hall Law School. In 1992, Schlafly ran as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives seat of Virginia's 11th congressional district; Schlafly came in last place in the primary.
Legal work.
Schlafly was an associate for the Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm in New York City before moving to private practice, stating: "Large firms never do work conservatives on homosexual or abortion issues." Additionally, Schlafly is General Counsel for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and led its Supreme Court challenge of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2010, Schlafly wrote an article for the "Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons" about the economic effects of the legislation.
In 2010, Schlafly became lead counsel for a group seeking to recall US Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. The group, associated with the tea party movement, argued that the US Constitution permits political recall for federal offices, despite not explicitly mentioning so. On November 18, 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected Schlafy's arguments, finding that the New Jersey provision violated the U.S. Constitution. Later that year, Schlafly represented the group RecallND in a case before the North Dakota Supreme Court in another frustrated effort to recall Kent Conrad, another Democratic US Senator.
Conservapedia.
Schlafly created the wiki-based encyclopedia Conservapedia in November 2006. He felt the need to start the project after reading a student's assignment written using Common Era dating notation rather than the Anno Domini system that he preferred. Although he was "an early Wikipedia enthusiast", as reported by Shawn Zeller of "Congressional Quarterly", Schlafly became concerned about perceived bias after Wikipedia editors repeatedly undid edits to the article about the 2005 Kansas evolution hearings. Schlafly expressed hope that Conservapedia would become a general resource for American educators and a counterpoint to the liberal bias that he perceived in Wikipedia.
In 2009, Schlafly appeared on "The Colbert Report" to discuss his Conservative Bible Project, a project hosted on Conservapedia that aims to rewrite English translations of the Bible in order to remove terms described as "liberal bias".
Dialogue with Richard Lenski.
Richard Lenski, an evolutionary biologist who completed an experiment on evolution which showed speciation of "E. coli" bacteria over 10,000 generations, was engaged in correspondence by Schlafly about the results in 2008. Conservapedia supports creationism and Schlafly disputed that bacteria could evolve via beneficial mutations. The correspondence was commented on across the Internet. Schlafly was criticized by Lenski on sites such as Ars Technica for not reading Lenski's paper properly, for not understanding the experimental data he requested, and for not taking notice of people on Conservapedia itself who considered the paper well researched.

Name Origin.
"Punta" is the term used by the people in that barrio to refer to the sugarcane stem cuttings that are used to plant sugarcane. During the rainy season, the stem cuttings are planted directly into the wet soil, while in summer, they are placed in flat beds and kept moist for weeks to induce germination. Because that part of Calamba was then mostly planted to sugarcane, preparation of "punta" for planting was a major activity in the barrio, thus, the name. In Tagalog, the word punta also means:

Fallout (Channel 4 drama)

Fallout, a feature-length as part of Channel 4's Disarming Britain series, is a drama surrounding the lives of a group of teenagers, following the fatal stabbing of a mutual associate, Kwame (Lanre Malaolu) in South London.
Synopsis.
Fallout begins with Kwame, playing basketball followed by him happily making his tragic journey home, on the phone to a girl. Just after telling this girl he loves her, Kwame notices a small gang, led by Dwayne (Aml Ameen). Kwame is quickly spotted by one of the gang members, Emile (Charles Mnene), and him and his fellow gang members stop him, while Emile searches him for any valuable goods. Finding nothing of value, Emile lets him go, but another gang member urges him to go after Kwame. Kwame runs through the local park, whilst frantically requesting help on his phone. The gang eventually catch up with him, and Emile stabs Kwame in the chest, after which he decides to steal Kwame's trainers. The gang flees from the scene. A friend of the gang witnesses Kwame's murder from across the road. She runs to the other side of road, to meet Kwame dying in a pool of his blood from his stab wound, begging for help. Shocked by what was in front of her, she ran away and left him to die. Kwame's death sets the pace for the rest of the film.
The friend of the gang runs to her close friend, Shanice (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who is Emile's girlfriend, and works nearby in a fast-food restaurant and tells her what she saw. Shanice is seen placing flowers at the scene of the crime. The gang flee to a nearby river, and dump Kwame's trainers in the river, to do away with any evidence and Dwayne orders his gang to get rid of their clothes to eradicate any evidence. 
Detective Sergeant Joe Stephens (Lennie James) stars as a former resident of the estate, assigned to this case alongsde his partner, Matt (Nicholas Gleaves). It wasn't long before it became evident that the gang were responsible for the murder. Knowing that the perpetrator was one of the gang members, Joe set out to get to the bottom of the crime and began pursuing Shanice, with the motive that she had something to hide. His pursuit of Shanice was noticed by the gang and he was given the name "white man's bitch" because his partner was white, and he wasn't reacting in the stereotypical manner that was expected from him, especially as he grew up in the very estate he was investigating. After a small disagreement with Dwayne over stolen money, Emile finds himself alone and disliked by the other gang members, as well as endangered as his accusation of ringleader Dwayne left Dwayne angered and intent on harming Emile. Dwayne and Emile's disagreement leaves Shanice and Dwayne alone. Dwayne confesses his feelings for Shanice, and they share a kiss, which was spotted and interrupted by Shanice's boyfriend Emile. Dwayne threatened Emile with a gun, but Shanice convinced him not to shoot.
Although Joe's frustration often left him branded as the bad guy, his pursuit of Shanice had paid off, and she had confessed to Joe that Emile was responsible for the crime. But it was later revealed that Shanice only knew who killed Kwame, and not what happened. It was in fact her close friend who witnessed the crime, and with full knowledge that the reward for catching and convicting the killer was £20,000, the close friend decided to tell the police what she knows. When asked the colour of the trainers, she incorrectly said they were white, at which point Joe, forgetting his surroundings, corrected her by saying they were blue. This blew Joe's cover as it revealed he knew more about the case than he was letting on, and was fired shortly after. 
When Emile emerged from his flat one night, he noticed that another member of his gang, Perry, waiting for him armed with a large knife which he produced upon sight of Emile. Emile reacted by observing the height distance between the floor level he was on and the ground before jumping in an attempt to escape. As he got back to his feet, he ran into Joe, who was left heavily angered by his dismissal of the job that defied the stereotypes of unemployed black men, and violently began to beat Emile up. While he was doing so, he referred to a provoking judgement Emile made about him becoming "vexed" earlier in the film, to which, at the time, Joe responded "You will know when I'm Vexed". During Joe's attack of Emile, he informed him that this is the result of him being vexed. As Joe continued to beat up Emile, Shanice came in Emile's defence, but Joe was convinced Emile didn't feel any remorse. Joe eventually left Emile, very badly hurt.
In the final moments of the film, Shanice pays Kwame's mother a visit. She explained to Kwame's mum that she was responsible for Kwame's death. She told Kwame's mother that she tried to make a move on Kwame, and he denied her advances. To get back at him, she told her boyfriend, Emile, that it was the other way round, and that Kwame had been making unwanted advances. Jealous Emile took out his anger on Kwame, which resulted in his death. Shanice then apologizes. Kwame's mother responds by saying, "The Lord will forgive you, which means I have to", and received her blessing. 
Emile was left disfigured and Shanice had a free conscience.

History of the National Hockey League (1942–1967)

The Original Six era of the National Hockey League (NHL) began in 1942 with the demise of the Brooklyn Americans, reducing the league to six teams: Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. This structure remained stable for a quarter century; the era ended in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size adding six expansion teams.
The Stanley Cup, was the "de facto" championship since 1926, becoming the "de jure" championship in 1947, when the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain control of the Cup. Toronto and Montreal evidenced dynasties, as the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup nine times from 1942 onwards, while the Canadiens won ten times, including five consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960. The 1967 championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date.
Remarkably, Maurice Richard became the first player to score 50 goals in a season in 1944–45. In 1955, Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman, leading to the Richard Riot. Gordie Howe made his debut in 1946, retiring 32 years later as the NHL's all-time leader in both goals and points. Willie O'Ree broke the NHL's colour barrier when he dressed for the Bruins in 1958.
The NHL continued to develop throughout the era. In 1943, in an attempt to 'open up' the game, the league introduced the centre-ice red line allowing players for the first time to pass out of their defensive zone. In 1959, Jacques Plante became the first goaltender to regularly wear a face mask for protection. Off the ice, the business of hockey was changing as well. The first amateur draft was held in 1963 as part of efforts to balance talent distribution within the league. The National Hockey League Players Association was formed in 1967, ten years after Ted Lindsay's attempts at unionization failed.
Background.
In the 1930s and early 1940s, both the Great Depression and World War II were detrimental to the NHL. Although the league peaked at ten teams between 1926 and 1931, financial pressures led to the demise of several of these. In 1930, the Pittsburgh Pirates relocated to become the Philadelphia Quakers before folding in 1931. In 1934, the Ottawa Senators became the St. Louis Eagles, and likewise ceased operations after one year in their new market. The Montreal Maroons suspended operations in 1937 as the Montreal market was unable to support two teams. The New York Americans, renamed the Brooklyn Americans, suspended operations in 1942, citing financial difficulty, and a lack of players due to the war. By the 1942–43 season, the league was reduced to six teams.
There was also change at the top; in February 1943, league President Frank Calder collapsed during a meeting, dying shortly after. After receiving assurances from the league the Brooklyn franchise he operated would resume play after the war, Red Dutton agreed to take over as president. When the other team owners reneged on this promise in 1946, Dutton resigned as league president. In 1946, with Dutton's recommendation, Clarence Campbell was named president of the NHL. Campbell remained until retirement in 1977. Campbell's tenure matched the league's stability. For the first 21 years of his presidency, the same six teams competed for the Stanley Cup; that period has been called the "golden age of hockey". The NHL featured increasingly intense rivalries coupled with rule innovations that opened up the game.
Post-war period.
World War II extensively ravaged the rosters of many teams; by the 1943–44 season teams battled each other for players. In need of a goaltender, the Bruins won a fight with the Canadiens over the services of Bert Gardiner. Meanwhile, the Rangers were forced to lend forward Phil Watson to the Canadiens in exchange for two players, as Watson was required in Montreal for a war job, and refused permission to play in New York.
With only five returning players from the previous season, Rangers general manager Lester Patrick suggested suspension of his team's play for the duration of the war. Patrick was otherwise persuaded; however, the Rangers managed only six wins in a 50-game schedule, giving up 310 goals that year. The Rangers were so desperate for players that 42-year old coach Frank Boucher made a brief comeback, recording four goals and ten assists in 15 games. That year the Canadiens dominated the league, finishing with a 38–5–7 record. Five losses remains a league record for the fewest in one season; the Canadiens did not lose a game on home ice. Their 1944 Stanley Cup victory was the team's first in 14 seasons. The Canadiens again dominated the 1944–45, finishing with a 38–8–4 record. They were defeated in the playoffs by the underdog Maple Leafs, who eventually won the Cup.
NHL teams exclusively competed for the Stanley Cup following the 1926 demise of the Western Hockey League. Though rejected by Cup trustees for various reasons, in the intervening years other teams, and leagues, attempted to challenge for the Cup. . In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant Cup control to the NHL, thereby allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues. The last such challenge came in 1953, from the Cleveland Barons of the American Hockey League; it was rejected, as the AHL was not considered of equivalent calibre to the NHL, which was a condition of the NHL's 'deal' with trustees.
The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 under the leadership of James T. Sutherland, a former President of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA). The Hall of Fame was established as a joint venture between the NHL and the CAHA, in Kingston, Ontario, considered by Sutherland the birthplace of hockey. Originally called the "International Hockey Hall of Fame", it's mandate was to honor great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first eleven honored members were inducted on April 30, 1945. Not until 1961 did the Hockey Hall of Fame establish a permanent home at Exhibition Place in Toronto.
On October 13, 1947, to raise money for the newly created NHL Pension Society, the first official All-Star Game took place at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. The NHL All-Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–3 and raised C$25,000 for the pension fund. The All-Star Game remains an annual tradition.
"Rocket" Richard.
The 1940s Canadiens were led by the "Punch line" of Elmer Lach, Toe Blake and Maurice "Rocket" Richard. In 1944–45, Lach, Richard and Blake finished first, second and third in the NHL's scoring race with 80, 73 and 67 points, respectively. Richard became a media and fan focus with attempts to score 50 goals in a 50 game season, a feat no other player had accomplished in league history. During that season, in a 9–1 victory over Detroit on December 28, 1944, Richard set a single-game scoring record, scoring five goals and three assists. Later scoring his 45th goal in his 42nd game, he broke Joe Malone's goal scoring record. Opposing teams did all they could to prevent him from reaching the 50-goal mark: he was slashed, elbowed and held, as no team wanted to be known for giving up the 50th goal. Despite the opposition's efforts, in Boston at 17:45 of the third period of Montreal's final game of the season, Richard scored his 50th goal. Until Mike Bossy in 1980–81, no other player scored 50 goals in 50 games.
In March 1955, Richard was suspended for the remainder of the season, including the playoffs, after receiving a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene. The suspension created a wave of anger towards Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Dismissing the warnings, Campbell attended the March 17 game, as planned. His presence was interpreted by many fans as provocation; he was booed, and pelted with eggs and fruit; an hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction; firefighters decided to clear the building. A riot ensued outside the Forum as disenchanted fans leaving the Forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators; the hostile crowd overwhelmed 250 police officers on the scene. Seventy people were arrested, another 37 people were injured; fifty stores were looted, and $100,000 in property damage was reported, in what became known as "l'affaire Richard", or the Richard Riot.
The following day, Richard went on Montreal radio to ask fans to cease rioting, and instead support the Canadiens in the playoffs; he offered to take his punishment then come back the following year to win the Cup. While the Canadiens were eliminated in the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals, Richard led Montreal to the 1956 Stanley Cup. The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada; the riot is often characterized as an early manifestation of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. Campbell's decision to suspend Richard was widely supported by fans outside of Quebec. Some, including Detroit's Ted Lindsay, said the suspension did not go far enough and argued Richard, a man who had paid more fines than any other player in league history, should have been banned for life.
On October 19, 1957, Richard became the first player to score 500 career goals. He retired in 1960, as an eight-time Stanley Cup champion, as well as the NHL's all-time leading scorer, with 544 goals. In 1961, the league waived the customary three-year waiting period; Richard was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.
"Hockey Night in Canada".
In the fall of 1951, in an attempt to determine whether it a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games, Conn Smythe watched special television feeds of Maple Leaf games. Television already had detractors within the NHL, especially Campbell who declared it "the greatest menace of the entertainment world". In 1952, even though only 10% of Canadians owned a television set, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began televising games. On November 1, 1952, "Hockey Night in Canada" was first broadcast on television, with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens. The broadcasts quickly became the highest-rated show on Canadian television. The broadcast came three weeks after Montreal radio host René Lecavalier presented a French-language telecast of the Montreal Canadiens' opener against Chicago, marking the beginning of "La Soirée du hockey", which Radio-Canada, the French arm of the CBC, broadcast until 2004. On that same night, Danny Gallivan made his debut as the English language play-by-play announcer for the Canadiens.
While Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person, Smythe felt the opposite. "There'll be thousands of people seeing hockey as played by the pros for the first time. They'll be sold on it because it's a great game, and they won't be satisfied to stay home but will turn out to the rinks." As an experiment in the 1956–57 season, CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States. Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to become viewer-friendly. In 1949, to make the puck easier to see, the league mandated the ice surface painted white. In 1951, so each team was distinguishable on black and white television, the League required home teams wear colored jerseys, and the road teams wear white. For the same reason, teams painted the centre red line in a checkered pattern to set it apart from the solid blue lines.
Dynasties.
Toronto Maple Leafs.
In the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals, in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime, the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one. After dashing from his defensive position, despite an earlier warning from Smythe not to take unnecessary chances, Leafs' defenceman Bill Barilko hammered the Cup-winning goal past Montreal goaltender Gerry McNeil. The goal completed Toronto's fourth Stanley Cup championship in five seasons, making Barilko a national hero. Four months later, Barilko and a friend disappeared in Northern Ontario, where they had flown on a fishing trip. Barilko's disappearance became front page news across Canada; a massive search failed to locate the missing plane. Barilko's remains were not found until 1962, the first year the Maple Leafs won the Cup since Barilko's overtime winner eleven years previous. Barilko's disappearance was immortalized 40 years later by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip in their 1992 song "Fifty Mission Cap".
By 1962, the disappearance of Bill Barilko and the Maple Leafs' subsequent failure to win the Stanley Cup led Toronto fans to believe a curse was upon the team. The Leafs won the 1962 championship shortly before Barilko's remains were discovered. In 1963, they repeated as champions. In 1964, the Leafs again played for the Stanley Cup against the Red Wings. In the third period of game six, trailing the series 3–2, Maple Leafs' defenceman Bobby Baun suffered a broken ankle from a Gordie Howe slap shot. Despite the injury, Baun returned with his ankle taped up to score the winning goal in overtime. Baun also played the seventh game as the Maple Leafs defeated the Red Wings to win their third consecutive title.
Detroit Red Wings.
Beginning in 1948–49, the Red Wings went on to win seven consecutive regular season titles - a feat no other team has accomplished. During that time, the Wings won four Stanley Cups. During the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals the Legend of the Octopus was created. For the fourth game of the finals, brothers Pete and Jerry Cusimano brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia. At the time, they reasoned the eight tentacles of an octopus represented the eight wins required to win the Stanley Cup. The Wings had won seven consecutive playoff games, and the brothers hoped the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth victory. The tradition was born, as Detroit handily defeated Montreal 3–0.
During this time, the Wings were led by Gordie Howe. In 1943, at the age of 15, Howe was invited to the Rangers player camp in Winnipeg; but quickly became homesick and failed to favorably impress the Rangers coaches. The next season the Red Wings invited him to their camp, where coach Jack Adams called him "the best prospect I've seen in 20 years." Two years later, at the age of 18, Howe debuted in the NHL for Detroit. On March 28, 1950, during a playoff game against the Leafs, Howe was nearly killed as he mistimed an attempted check on Toronto's Ted Kennedy, causing him to slam head first into the boards. Rushed to hospital, doctors drilled a hole into Howe's skull to relieve pressure on his brain. Despite fears he would never play again, "Mr. Hockey" both recovered to start the following season, then won his first of four consecutive scoring titles in 1950–51. Howe was 52 years old when he retired from professional hockey.
Montreal Canadiens.
In three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956, the Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals. Detroit won the first two match-ups, however, Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup, ending one dynasty and starting another. Subsequently, the Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960, a feat no other team has duplicated.
In 1953, the Canadiens signed Jean Beliveau; a well-anticipated prospect in the NHL for years. Because his Quebec Senior Hockey League team, the Quebec Aces, matched any contract offer the Canadiens made, Beliveau repeatedly refused to turn professional with Montreal. Ultimately, Montreal bought the entire league outright, along with the rights to all players, and turned it professional. Beliveau finally signed with Montreal for $105,000 over five years and a $20,000 bonus, an unprecedented contract for a rookie. Playing for Montreal, Beliveau went on to win ten Stanley Cups.
Led by Richard and Beliveau, the 1950s Canadiens had overwhelming offensive ability; to slow their offence the NHL amended it's rules. To illustrate, the 1955–56 Canadiens frequently scored multiple goals during the same two-minute powerplay. In one game against Boston, during a penalty, Beliveau scored three goals in 44 seconds. For the following season, the league instituted a rule permitting a player serving a minor penalty to return to the ice when a goal was scored against his team.
Breaking the colour barrier.
On January 18, 1958, by joining the Bruins as an 'injury call-up' for a game in Montreal, Willie O'Ree became the first black player in the NHL. Playing only two games with the Bruins in the 1957–58 season, O'Ree returned in 1960–61, playing another 43 games with Boston. Although he only played 45 NHL games, scoring four goals, he earned the label the "Jackie Robinson of hockey".
Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, remarking "people just wanted a piece of me, maybe because they thought I was different, so I had to defend myself. I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. But never in Boston. I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. They accepted me totally. All of them had class." In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal but was unable to crack the Canadiens' line-up. Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.
O'Ree's breakthrough came several years after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told "See that man sitting in the blues? That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. "They told me that if I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me."
"Norris House League".
During the 1960s, it was often joked "NHL" stood for "Norris House League" because the Norris family held interests in several league teams. James D. Norris was co-owner of the Black Hawks along with Arthur Wirtz; his brother Bruce inherited ownership of the Red Wings. James D. Norris was also the largest shareholder in Madison Square Garden, giving him control over the Rangers.
The Black Hawks qualified for the playoffs only once between 1949 and 1957. The team's fortunes turned in 1958–59, following the acquisition of Ted Lindsay and Glenn Hall from Detroit. Making the playoffs, the Black Hawks, lost to Montreal in the semi-finals in 1959 and 1960, before capturing their first championship in 23 years, in the 1961 Stanley Cup Finals. Chicago next won the Cup 49 years later in the 2009-10 season.
The Hawks' resurgence in the 1960s led Norris and Wirtz to take advantage of their customers. Dubbed the "Chicken Wings" by fans, the Hawks were famous for fleecing fans. Ticket sellers were arrested for scalping; the team charged $9 for playoff tickets in 1965, $3 more than Detroit, Toronto or Montreal. The Hawks also refused to broadcast road playoff games in Chicago, preferring to charge fans to watch the games via closed-circuit television at Chicago Stadium. Fans responded by littering the ice and passing out leaflets urging a boycott of the team during Chicago's last regular season game in 1964–65.
Expansion.
In 1963, Rangers governor William Jennings introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. His argument was based around concerns the Western Hockey League intended to operate in the near future as a major league. Jennings also hoped inclusion of teams on the west coast would make the league truly national, and thereby, improve the chances of returning to television in the United States as the NHL had lost its deal with CBS. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion surfaced every time the owners met subsequently. In 1965, there was agreement to expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. San Francisco–Oakland and Vancouver were declared "acceptable cities" with Los Angeles and St. Louis as potential sites. Fourteen applications were received from across Canada and the United States, including four from Los Angeles.
In February 1966, the governors met and awarded franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. The six winning bids each paid $2 million for their franchises. St. Louis was awarded a franchise with no bid received. The league's decision to grant a franchise was contingent on a potential owner stepping forward - a decision influenced by the Norris and Wirtz families, who owned the St. Louis Arena.
Canadians were outraged no expansion teams were awarded to Canada. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson stated: "the NHL decision to expand only in the U.S. impinges on the sacred principles of all Canadians." Maple Leafs coach Punch Imlach stated Vancouver was "sold out" and Toronto and Montreal did not want to share television revenue with another Canadian team. Leafs co-owner Stafford Smythe put the blame on the city of Vancouver. Smythe had offered to build and operate an $8 million facility in the city's downtown area, but a proposal to sell a $2.5 million section of land to Smythe for $1 was defeated in a municipal referendum. "Vancouver lost its chance the day it turned down the referendum on our arena proposal", Smythe said. "That proved to me that the people out there aren't interested in going major league."
The Original Six era ended with the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals between the two-time defending champion Canadiens, and the Maple Leafs. The oldest team in the league, the third place Leafs were led in goal by 37-year old Terry Sawchuk and 42-year old Johnny Bower. Known as the "over the hill gang", in six games, Toronto became the oldest team to win the Cup, defeating the favored Canadiens. The Maple Leafs have not appeared in the Stanley Cup finals since.
Rules and innovations.
In 1942, due to World War II related travel restrictions, league president Frank Calder abolished the 10-minute overtime for regular season games so teams could catch their trains without delay. With the war's conclusion, regular season overtime did not return, although playoff games continued until a winner was decided. Overtime was re-introduced in the regular 1983–84 season.
In 1943, to make it more entertaining, the rules committee looked to increase the game's speed. Rangers coach Frank Boucher proposed the neutral zone divided by a centre red line, so teams could pass the puck out of the defensive zone into their half of the neutral zone. Previously, the league required defensive players carry the puck from the defensive zone, not permitting a pass across the blue line. Introduced in 1943–44, the new rule changed the game. Formerly, strong fore-checking pinned opponents in their own zone for minutes at a time; subsequently, teams rushed up the ice with defencemen passing to forwards beyond the blue line. Scoring increased 10% league-wide; four of six teams topped 200 goals, the first time teams did so. In the early 1960s, Stan Mikita inadvertently introduced the curved blade to a hockey stick. Cracking his blade during a practice and not wanting to retrieve another, Mikita shot the puck in anger. He noticed the curve in the cracked blade caused the puck to behave differently. Both Mikita and Bobby Hull experimented with heating and bending their stick blade to create different curves. Using a curved blade, Mikita went on to win four Art Ross Trophies as the NHL's leading scorer. He later sai: he regretted the idea: "It's one of the worst inventions in hockey, because it eliminated the use of the backhand."
The NHL Amateur Draft was first held on June 5, 1963 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec. Created by Campbell, it was meant to more evenly distribute talent. To that point, teams directly sponsored junior clubs, buying a player's rights. A 16-year-old with the St. Michaels Juveniles, Garry Monahan, was the first player selected in the 1963 draft. Monahan remains the youngest player ever selected in an NHL draft. The Entry Draft system did not fully replace the sponsorship system until 1969.
Goaltending.
Goaltender Clint Benedict was the first to wear facial protection, donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose. Because its design interfered with his vision, Bennedict quickly abandoned the mask. Twenty-nine years later, Jacques Plante made the goalie mask a permanent fixture in hockey. In 1956, Plante began wearing a mask in practice after shots from teammates twice broke cheekbones. Montreal coach Toe Blake refused to allow Plante to wear his mask in games. On November 1, 1959, in a game at Madison Square Garden, that changed, when Plante was struck in the face. Teams did not dress backup goaltenders; the game was delayed 20 minutes, while doctors frantically stitched up Plante. When Blake asked Plante if he was 'ready to return', Plante refused unless allowed to wear his mask. Livid, Blake agreed only if Plante removed the mask when his face was healed. Wearing the mask, Plante led the Canadiens on an 18-game unbeaten streak, to finally remove the mask at Blake's urging; promptly the team lost their first game. Defeated, Blake relented. Plante's mask became a permanent fixture as he led the Canadiens to their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup. Soon after, other goalies followed Plante's lead.
Remarkably, Terry Sawchuk played goal for most of his career not wearing a mask ; he crouched very low such that his shoulders nearly touched his knees. This stance became known as the "gorilla crouch". During his career, Sawchuk relied on his ability to see the puck under the players' bodies, his outstanding mobility, and reflexes, to win four Vezina Trophies. By 1955, he was regarded as the greatest goaltender to ever play the game. Sawchuk's career was cut short when he died in 1970 from injuries suffered in a drunken incident with teammate Ron Stewart. The Hall of Fame waived it's waiting period, immediately inducting Sawchuk as the NHL's all-time record holder in wins (447) and shutouts (103). Sawchuk's style of play was a precursor to the modern goaltending butterfly style.
The butterfly style - used by most all modern goaltenders - was invented by Glenn Hall. Considered both unique and foolish, Hall's style of dropping to his knees and kicking his pads out in a V formation forced shooters to aim for the top half of the net. Hall adopted the technique as a youth when he lacked the arm strength to stop shots with his stick. An eight-time All-Star, Hall became an NHL regular at the start of the 1955–1956 season to begin a sequence of 502 consecutive games as goaltender for Detroit and Chicago. This record is hailed as one of the NHL's most unbreakable.
Unionization.
The first players' union was formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat on the board of the NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. The league claimed that it was barely breaking even financially, and so could not contribute more than it did. Players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise, leading Lindsay and Doug Harvey of the Canadiens to discussions on forming a union in 1956. The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, every NHL player had signed up with the exception of Ted Kennedy, who was retiring.
The owners immediately worked to crush the union. Toronto owner Conn Smythe compared the players association to communism: "I feel that anything spawned in secrecy as this association was certainly has to have some odour to it." Red Wings president Bruce Norris responded by trading Lindsay to his brother's team, the Black Hawks. The move was widely seen as punitive, as the Hawks had finished last in the NHL every season, save one, from 1949 until 1957. Lindsay was not the only player sent to Chicago as punishment; Glenn Hall was included as he refused to distance himself from Lindsay. In Toronto, Smythe repeatedly benched Jim Thomson, who was the union's secretary, before also dealing him to the Black Hawks. The Players' Association responded by filing a $3 million anti-trust lawsuit against the NHL. Persuaded by teammates Gordie Howe and Red Kelly, the Red Wings players voted to withdraw from the association in November 1957. Other teams quickly followed, and the union capitulated. Union leadership ultimately agreed to drop the lawsuit in exchange for small concessions, which included a minimum annual salary of $7,000, increases to the pension contributions and moving expenses for traded players.
Led by Alan Eagleson, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) was formed in 1967. Eagleson became the sport's first player agent in 1966 when he negotiated a deal on behalf of Bobby Orr with the Bruins that saw the 18-year-old rookie become the highest paid player in the NHL. At its peak, Eagleson's practice represented 150 professional athletes. Eagleson had also helped settle an American Hockey League players strike sparked by mistreatment of players. In June 1967, the NHLPA was announced, and quickly received acceptance from the owners.

The Best Show on WFMU with Tom Scharpling

The Best Show on WFMU with Tom Scharpling was a combination music, call-in, and comedy radio show hosted by Tom Scharpling on New Jersey-based radio station WFMU. The show's slogan was "Three hours of mirth, music, and mayhem."
"The Best Show" first aired on October 10, 2000, occupying the 9pm-11pm time slot. Starting June 5, 2001, the show was expanded to three hours, filling the 9pm-midnight slot. A worldwide audience listens to the show live through WFMU's Internet stream, and many episodes are also archived on the radio station's website. "The Best Show" began podcasting its shows, with the music removed due to licensing restrictions, on January 26, 2006. In October 2013, Scharpling announced his intention to end "The Best Show" within several months, with the program's finale airing on December 17. “I’ve joked around about this before, and I’m not joking around about it now,” Scharpling told listeners. “It’s hard to do something that’s more or less a full-time job for free, and I’ve done it for as long as I can. . . . It has to happen. That’s just the reality.” 
The show has listeners and callers around the world, from the United States and Canada, to as far afield as the U.K., Sweden, Japan, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Regular callers and in-studio guests of note include Todd Barry, Andy Kindler, Aimee Mann, Paul F. Tompkins, Ted Leo, John Hodgman, and Patton Oswalt.
Background.
Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster is a frequent caller to the show, adopting a variety of personae hailing from the fictional and surreal New Jersey suburb of "Newbridge." Frequent Wurster characters include "Philly Boy Roy" (an unflinching supporter of all things Philadelphia), "Timmy von Trimble" (a genetically modified, two-inch-tall racist), and "The Gorch" (a senior citizen from York, Pennsylvania, who claims that the character of The Fonz on the TV show "Happy Days" was based on him, without permission). Some of these calls have been released on CD by Scharpling and Wurster's Stereolaffs label.

On February 11, 2003, Janeane Garofalo and Sam Seder appeared on The Best Show to discuss the political atmosphere of America. The chemistry between them as radio talents was evident, and their agreement on many liberal political views made them kindred spirits. In the summer of that same year, Garofalo was approached by representatives of Air America Radio to be a radio personality for their programming. She insisted that they hire Seder and that he share the hosting responsibilities. Less than one year later, "The Majority Report" was born.
Legacy.
"Best Show Gems".
On February 23, 2009, a spin-off program titled "Best Show Gems" began podcasting once every other week. The podcast is a "greatest hits"-type program featuring highlights from "The Best Show". "Best Show Gems" ranges anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, and usually centers on a call between Scharpling and Wurster.
Big Dipper Reunion.
On his January 20, 2004 radio program, Scharpling had been derisively talking about the VH1 show "Bands Reunited". This discussion led to Scharpling facetiously declaring his goal of reuniting the beloved (though relatively unknown) 1980s Boston indie-rock band Big Dipper. In the following weeks, the concept of a "Big Dipper Reunion" had become a recurring in-joke on the program. Scharpling began calling the members at home to convince them to reunite. In 2008, the group reunited for a live concert. In advance of several reunion shows in April 2008, Merge Records released the 3-disc "" on March 18, featuring liner notes by Scharpling.

Orison (The X-Files)

"Orison" is the seventh episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on January 9, 2000. It was written by Chip Johannessen, directed by Rob Bowman, and featured guest appearances by Nick Chinlund. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. In addition, "Orison" serves as a sequel, and brings closure, to the second season episode "Irresistible", with Chinlund reprising his role as Donnie Pfaster. "Orison" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.4, being watched by 15.63 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, with several heavily criticizing the final scene featuring Scully killing Pfaster, calling it a betrayal of characterization.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Reverend Orison releases Donnie Pfaster, Scully's former kidnapper, from jail in the hopes of passing judgment on him. What he discovers instead is that he has released pure evil, and it’s headed for Scully.
"Orison" was written by Johannessen, who had formerly been an executive producer on the television series "Millennium". Johannessen's first draft featured an escaped prisoner who could stop time. Executive producers Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, and John Shiban enjoyed the premise and decided to bring back Donnie Pfaster. However, instead of continuing in the style of "Irresistible", the episode went in a "substantial new direction".
Plot.
At a prison, a man gets his fingers chopped off during a workshop and all the other inmates move very slowly to help him, while one man walks out at regular speed. The man is revealed to be Donnie Pfaster, who kidnapped Scully five years earlier. Pfaster, who happens to be a "death fetishist", is obsessed with cutting women's hair and eating their fingers. After hearing that Pfaster escaped from prison, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) take the case and investigate. It turns out three men escaped from three prisons and all had contact with a prison chaplain named Reverend Orison. Eventually, the US Marshals corner Pfaster and Orison at a diner, but Orison uses his power of persuasion to distract the Marshals, allowing the two to escape. Pfaster takes Orison's car and runs Orison over. Meanwhile, Scully keeps hearing the same song, "Don't Look Any Further", everywhere she goes and soon begins to believe it is a sign. After finding him unconscious, Mulder and Scully question Orison and show him a photo of the remains of a prostitute Pfaster killed. They also find that Orison killed someone and spent 22 years in prison himself. Orison claims he is being spoken to by God and doing his work. After a medical exam, Mulder finds out that Orison has three times the bloodflow capacity of the brain and he drilled a hole in head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. He does this while repeating the phrase "Glory, Amen."
Later, Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and escapes. Pfaster hires a prostitute, but soon realizes she is wearing a wig and attempts to attack her, but she gets away. Orison finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint while he digs a grave for him, but Pfaster morphs into a demonic beast and kills Orison, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, tells them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully and Scully confesses to him that the only reason he was not given the death penalty was because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.
Production.
Writing.
"Orison" was written by Chip Johannessen, who had formerly been an executive producer on the Chris Carter-created television series "Millennium". In Johannessen's first draft, the episode's main antagonist was a prisoner with the ability to stop time. Executive producers Carter, Frank Spotnitz, and John Shiban found the episode's premise promising. However, Carter enjoyed the story because it bore stylistic similarities to the first season episode "Beyond the Sea".
After reading the first draft, Spotnitz and Carter decided to reintroduce Donnie Pfaster, a character from the second season episode "Irresistible". Carter noted that, "we had talked about possibly revisiting some old monster this season, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity." The writers and producers decided to take "Orison" in a "substantial new direction". Although Donnie Pfaster was originally portrayed as a "death fetishist", his nature was non-supernatural. In "Orison", however, it was decided to make Pfaster into a true demon. Shiban explained "we decided late in the process to turn him into this totally demonic character, essentially evil as an entity." Spotnitz was very excited about bringing closure to the Pfaster-Scully story. He explained, "For me, what really justified bringing Donnie back was the final act of the script when Donnie comes for Scully and she ends up shooting him full of holes." The final scene, however, proved difficult to script. Director Rob Bowman noted, that the act "was a tough scene. Frank and I had spoken on the phone about the dialogue in the wrap-up scene with Mulder and Scully. Even though she shot him in the heightened state, you couldn't deny the fact that she killed Donnie Psaster in cold blood. How do we deal with that?"
Casting and filming.
Nick Chinlund returned to the series to reprise his role as Pfaster. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, eventually settled on Scott Wilson for the role of Orison believing that he could pull off the "dual nature" of the character better than anyone else. The episode featured several complex scenes, most notably the shot at the beginning, where time slows to a stop. Bowman used several different takes, all filmed at different film speeds in order to achieve the right effect. The final fight scene between Scully and Pfaster took a day and a half to film. Make-up for the episode was done by John Vulich, who sought to "pay homage" to the make-up in the original episode. In order to do this, Vulich perused several fan sites and downloaded photos that he used as models.
Music.
The song that Scully keeps hearing in the episode is "Don't Look Any Further", originally by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions in order to find the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs "really worked." Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects for emphasis. He explained, "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes in the room with Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do these big boom single hits with a lot of reverb. There's nothing else but that. Sometimes, that is really effective."
Broadcast and reception.
"Orison" first aired in the United States on January 9, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.4, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 9.4 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 15.63 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 30, 2000. and received 0.78 million viewers, making it the fourth most watched television episode of any program that week. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "Five years ago, a demonic madman tried to murder Scully. Tonight he strikes again."
The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, "'Orison' rises above its origins in the depressing, hackneyed genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone "X-Files" stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a largely positive review, writing "['Orison' was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It was also one of the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she did right, but it certainly wasn't a difficult thing to understand." Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" awarded the episode a "B" and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a "potentially fascinating figure" who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it "helps transform the episode’s climax into something more than a simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series "Millennium".
Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", were extremely critical of the episode and rated it one star out of five. Shearman and Pearson called the episode a "mess", with the effect that "it cheapens 'Irresistible' badly". The two, however, point out the sequence wherein Scully murders Pfaster as the worst scene in the episode, arguing that the scene was "at worst a betrayal of characterization that has badly damaged the moral fibre of the series." Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris heavily criticized the episode as "a retread of 'Irresistible'". Furthermore, she derided the ending, noting that "nothing in the episode that Scully [was on the verge of losing her self-control".

Daria's Inferno

"Daria's Inferno" is a 2000 computer game developed by Hypnotix and published by Simon & Schuster Interactive. The game is based on the animated TV show "Daria". Players control the character Daria Morgendorffer through the fictional town of Lawndale. Characters in the game are voiced by the same voice actors as on the TV show.

Premise.
Daria falls asleep in English class while Mr O'Neil is reading Dante's "Inferno". She finds herself in her own inferno, taken from the distastes she finds in her world. In her dream, Daria must recover five items stolen from the school, or the entire student body will be placed in detention.
Gameplay.
The game uses third-person perspective and consists of five levels. Each level contains mazes to navigate as well as inventory-based puzzles. The graphics are styled in the same cartoon manner as the TV show. The game provides hints for what to do in the form of "Sick, Sad World" clips.
Reception.
"Daria's Inferno" received mixed reviews. Tap-repeatedly.com gave a favorable review, praising both the gameplay and the game's "pure cartoon" graphics. By contrast, Allgame graded the game 1½ stars out of 5, finding fault with the game's short length and ease of play, as well as disparaging the "dull and unimaginative" cartoon graphics. A reviewer from gamesfirst.com gave the game 2 stars out of 5; he criticized the game's length and ease but applauded the voice acting. Just Adventure assigned the game a score of 58%, stating that while the game was far from a classic, it deserved more attention.

Galabank

Galabank is a football stadium in the town of Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It is the home ground of Annan Athletic.
History.
Annan Athletic, who were then playing in the Carlisle and District League, moved to Galabank in 1953. They had previously been based at Mafeking Park since the 1946-47 season. The club rejoined Scottish football in 1977, playing in the South of Scotland League and later the East of Scotland League. This enabled the club to attempt to qualify for the Scottish Cup, and Galabank hosted its first match in the national competition against Stranraer on 15 December 1979.
On 3 July 2008 Annan Athletic were accepted into the Scottish Football League for the first time, to replace defunct club Gretna. Consequently Galabank began hosting Annan's games in the Scottish Football League Third Division in the 2008–09 season.
A party from the SFL inspected Galabank before Annan were accepted into the league. They deemed it to be of the required standard, with the provision that Annan install floodlights, which the club did before the start of their first season in the lowest tier of the Scottish Football League. Galabank has a capacity of 2,514.
The grass pitch was removed and a new 3G artificial surface was installed for the 2012–13 season. Since 2012, Galabank has been shared by South of Scotland League club Mid-Annandale, whose previous ground in Lockerbie had become unusable.
Records.
The highest ever official attendance to watch a match at Galabank was 2,517, set in a goalless draw against Rangers on 15 September 2012.

"Ramblin' On My Mind" is a blues song recorded on November 23, 1936 in San Antonio, Texas by legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. The song was originally released on 78 rpm format as Vocalion 03519 and ARC 7-05-81. Johnson performed the song in the key of E, and recorded two takes. Both takes were used for different pressings of both the Vocalion issue and the ARC issue.
The song uses the melody made popular by the hit record "M & O Blues" by Walter Davis. Johnson composed two songs to this melody "Ramblin' On My Mind" and When You Got A Good Friend with different musical approaches and different guitar tunings, although both were in the key of E. For "Ramblin' On My Mind" he used an open tuning that allowed him to combine a boogie shuffle on the bass strings with bottleneck triplets on the treble strings. These slide triplets were model for Elmore James's famous accompaniment to Dust My Broom.
The song was covered by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and featured on the album "Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton", and by Clapton on the albums "Just One Night", "", "Sessions for Robert J", and on "Live from Madison Square Garden".

Keelung Campaign

The Keelung Campaign (August 1884–April 1885) was a controversial military campaign undertaken by the French in northern Formosa (Taiwan) during the Sino-French War. After making a botched attack on Keelung in August 1884, the French landed an expeditionary corps of 2,000 men and captured the port in October 1884. Unable to advance beyond their bridgehead, they were invested inside Keelung by superior Chinese forces under the command of the imperial commissioner Liu Ming-ch'uan. In November and December 1884 cholera and typhoid drained the strength of the French expeditionary corps, while reinforcements for the Chinese army flowed into Formosa via the Pescadores Islands, raising its strength to 35,000 men by the end of the war. Reinforced in January 1885 to a strength of 4,500 men, the French won two impressive tactical victories against the besieging Chinese in late January and early March 1885, but were not strong enough to exploit these victories. The Keelung campaign ended in April 1885 in a strategic and tactical stalemate. The campaign was criticised at the time by Admiral Amédée Courbet, the commander of the French Far East Squadron, as strategically irrelevant and a wasteful diversion of the French navy.
Background.
Following the defeat of China's Kwangsi Army by the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps in the Bac Ninh campaign (March 1884), a two-year confrontation between France and China in northern Vietnam was ended on 11 May 1884 by the conclusion of the Tientsin Accord, under which the Chinese undertook to withdraw their troops from Vietnam and to recognise a French protectorate in Tonkin. However, the hopes aroused by this agreement, which seemed to have brought France's Tonkin campaign to a victorious end, were shattered on 23 June 1884 by the Bac Le ambush, in which a French column advancing to occupy Lang Son and other frontier towns was attacked near Bac Le by a detachment of the Kwangsi Army.
When news of the 'Bac Le Ambush' reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Jules Ferry's government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tientsin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay an indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Admiral Amédée Courbet, the commander of France's newly created Far East Squadron, was ordered to take his ships to Foochow. He was instructed to prepare to attack the Chinese fleet in the harbour and to destroy the Foochow Navy Yard. Meanwhile, as a demonstration of what would follow if the Chinese remained recalcitrant, Courbet was ordered on 2 August to despatch a naval force to the port of Keelung (基隆) in northern Formosa, destroy its coastal defences, and occupy the town as a 'pledge' ("gage") to be bargained against a Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin.
Failed French landing at Keelung, August 1884.
French interest in Keelung dated from February 1884, when Admiral Sébastien Lespès, the commander of France's Far East naval division, had recommended its occupation in the event of a war between France and China on the grounds that it could be easily seized and easily held. When this recommendation was made, Keelung was poorly defended. As tension between France and China grew in July 1884 the garrison of Keelung was substantially increased and the town's defences improved, and in August 1884 it was no longer the easy target it had been six months earlier. Its inner harbour was defended by three shore batteries: the recently completed Ta-sha-wan Battery (大沙灣砲台), boasted by the Chinese to be impregnable; the Ehr-sha-wan battery (二沙灣砲台) on the eastern side of the harbour; and a third battery on the seaward slope of Mount Clement (Huo-hao-shan, 火號山), a prominent hill to the west of the town. By the end of July 1884 there were 5,000 Chinese soldiers stationed in northern Formosa, deployed around the ports of Keelung and Tamsui. The appointment of Liu Ming-ch'uan (劉銘傳) as imperial commissioner for Formosa in July 1884 also underscored the determination of the Ch'ing government to defend Formosa. Liu was a veteran military commander, who had distinguished himself in the Taiping Rebellion.
Liu Ming-ch'uan was aware that Keelung and the nearby port of Tamsui (淡水) were likely targets for a French attack, and made sensible defensive dispositions to oppose a landing at both towns. He stationed 2,500 Chinese troops around Keelung, the likeliest target, under the command of the generals Sun K'ai-hua (孫開華) and Su Te-sheng (蘇得勝), while he himself remained with the other half of his army at Tai-pak-fu (台北府, modern Taipei, 台北), occupying a central position that would allow him to move quickly either to Tamsui or to Keelung once the French threat developed.
Admiral Courbet, then aboard the French cruiser "Volta" in the Min River, received the French government's order to attack Keelung on the evening of 2 August. He entrusted this mission to Admiral Lespès, his second-in-command, who left the Min River the following morning aboard the gunboat "Lutin" to meet the ironclads "Bayard" and "La Galissonnière" off the island of Matsu. At Matsu Lespès transferred "Bayard"'s landing company to his flagship "La Galissonnière", and on the night of 3 August crossed the Formosa Strait with "La Galissonnière" and "Lutin". The two French ships arrived off Keelung on the morning of 4 August, where the cruiser "Villars" was already waiting for them.
On the morning of 5 August, after the Chinese rejected a French ultimatum to hand over their coastal defences, "La Galissonnière", "Villars" and "Lutin" engaged and disabled Keelung's three coastal batteries. Admiral Lespès put a landing force ashore in the afternoon to occupy Keelung and the nearby coal mines at Pei-tao (Pa-tou, 八斗), but the arrival of a large body of Chinese troops led by Liu Ming-ch'uan forced the French to make a fighting withdrawal and re-embark on 6 August. French casualties in this unsuccessful operation were 2 dead and 11 wounded. The Chinese suffered markedly heavier casualties.
French strategic debate, September 1884.
In the wake of the Battle of Foochow (23 August 1884), which inaugurated the nine-month Sino-French War, the French decided to make a second attempt to put pressure on China by seizing Keelung. Admiral Courbet argued vigorously against a campaign in Formosa and submitted alternative proposals for a campaign in northern Chinese waters to seize either Port Arthur or Weihaiwei. He was supported by Jules Patenôtre, the French minister to China.
Courbet's proposals, although militarily attractive, were too ambitious for the French government to stomach. The French premier Jules Ferry fought the Sino-French War in the teeth of parliamentary disapproval, and was unable to give Courbet the resources necessary for a major campaign on the Chinese mainland. A limited operation to seize Keelung, on the other hand, could be undertaken with the forces already at Courbet's disposal. The town could be taken and held by a relatively small French force, and with its nearby coal mines would make an admirable wartime base for the Far East Squadron. A victory at Keelung would also avenge the failure of 6 August. The decision to attack Keelung was made by the French cabinet on 18 September 1884. For good measure, the cabinet also sanctioned an attack on nearby Tamsui, provided that the town could be captured without damage to European commercial interests.
French capture of Keelung, 1 October 1884.
On 1 October 1884 Lieutenant-Colonel Bertaux-Levillain landed at Keelung with a small expeditionary corps (2,250 men) drawn from the French garrisons in Tonkin and Cochinchina. The Formosa Expeditionary Corps (French: "corps expéditionnaire de Formose") consisted of three four-company battalions of marine infantry ("chefs de bataillon" Ber, Lacroix and Lange), a marine artillery battery, and a scratch battery of two 80-millimetre mountain guns and 4 Hotchkiss "canons-revolvers". A small force of Vietnamese porters accompanied the combatants.
The men of the expeditionary corps sailed from Saigon and Along Bay in the third week of September aboard the state transports "Nive", "Tarn" and "Drac" and joined the Far East Squadron off the island of Matsu on 29 September. The three troopships were escorted on the final leg of their journey by the ironclad "Bayard". On the morning of 30 September the invasion force arrived off Keelung. Courbet scouted the Chinese defences during the afternoon, and gave orders for an opposed landing on the following morning.
At dawn on 1 October Ber's marine infantry battalion was put ashore to the west of Keelung, at the foot of Mount Clement. Supported by naval gunfire from several ships of Courbet's Far East Squadron, the French scaled Mount Clement and established a defensive position on its summit, flanking the Chinese out of their positions to the south of Keelung and threatening their line of retreat to Tamsui. French casualties in the battle for Mount Clement were negligible: 4 killed and 12 wounded. Chinese casualties, according to Formosan informants, were around 100 killed and 200 to 300 wounded. In the first week of October the French occupied several hills in the immediate vicinity of Keelung and began to fortify them. However, the expeditionary corps was too small to advance beyond Keelung, and the Pei-tao coal mines remained in Chinese hands.
Liu Ming-ch'uan had commanded the unsuccessful defence of Keelung in person, with a Chinese division of 2,000 troops. Anticipating that the French would follow up their success with a landing at Tamsui, he left half of his force in strong defensive positions around Lok-tao (Liu-tu, 六堵), astride the road to Tamsui, and retreated to Tai-pak-fu with the rest on 3 October. It was rumoured that he intended to flee south to Tek-cham (竹塹, modern Hsinchu, 新竹), and his arrival in Tai-pak-fu was greeted with rioting. Several of his bodyguards were killed and he himself was arrested and held for several days in the city's Lungshan temple.
French defeat at Tamsui, 8 October 1884.
Meanwhile, after an ineffective naval bombardment on 2 October, Admiral Lespès attacked the Chinese defences at Tamsui with 600 sailors from the French squadron’s landing companies on 8 October. Tamsui had a large foreign population at this period, and many of the town's European residents formed picnic parties and flocked to vantage points on the nearby hills to watch the unfolding battle.
The French attack soon began to falter. The French "fusiliers-marins" were not trained to fight as line infantry, and were attacking over broken ground. "Capitaine de frégate" Boulineau of "Château-Renaud", who had replaced the officer originally scheduled to command the attack at the last moment, lost control of his men in the thick undergrowth in front of the Chinese forts. The French line gradually lost its cohesion and ammunition began to run short. The Chinese forces at Tamsui, numbering around 1,000 men, were under the command of the generals Sun K'ai-hua and Chang Kao-yuan (章高元). Seeing the French in confusion, Sun K'ai-hua advanced with his own forces and outflanked the French on both wings. The French hastily withdrew to the shore and re-embarked under cover of the squadron's guns. French casualties at Tamsui were 17 dead and 49 wounded. Chinese casualties, according to European employees of the Tamsui customs, were 80 dead and around 200 wounded.
The repulse at Tamsui was one of the rare French defeats in the Sino-French War, and had immediate political significance. China's war party had been placed on the defensive after the loss of China's Fukien fleet in the Battle of Foochow on 23 August 1884, but the unexpected Chinese victory at Tamsui six weeks later bolstered the position of the hardliners in the Ch'ing court. The court thereupon decided to continue the war against France until the French withdrew their demand for the payment of an indemnity for the Bac Le ambush, rejecting an American offer of mediation made shortly after the battle. This decision ensured that the Sino-French War would continue for several more months, with increasing losses and expenditure on both sides.
Actions around Keelung, November and December 1884.
As a result of the defeat at Tamsui, French control over Formosa was limited merely to the town of Keelung and to a number of positions on the surrounding hills. This achievement fell far short of what had been hoped for, but without reinforcements the French could go no further. They therefore did their best to fortify the precarious bridgehead at Keelung. Several forts were built to cover the various approaches to the town. Fort Clement, Fort Central and Fort Thirion faced west towards the Chinese positions at Lok-tao. Fort Tamsui and Eagle's Nest ("Nid d'aigle") covered the approach to Keelung from the southwest along the main road from Tamsui. Cramoisy Pagoda, a large Chinese house converted into a fort and manned by Captain Cramoisy's marine infantry company, covered the southern approach to Keelung. Fort Ber, Fort Gardiol and Fort Bayard, a chain of forts collectively known as the 'Ber Lines', crowned the low range of hills that screened Keelung's eastern suburb of Sao-wan. The three Chinese forts disabled by the French in August were repaired and named respectively Fort Lutin, Fort Villars and Fort La Galissonnière, after the three ships that had engaged them.
On 2 November 1884 the Chinese general Ts’ao Chih-chung (曹志忠) attacked the French outposts of Fort Tamsui and Eagle's Nest to the southwest of Keelung with a force of 2,000 men. The attackers made a night march from Tsui-tng-ka (水返腳, now Hsichih, 汐止), hoping to take the French by surprise with a dawn attack, but failed to reach their positions in time. The Chinese attack was made in daylight and was easily repelled by the French, who mowed down the attackers with Hotchkiss and rifle fire. The Chinese admitted to a loss of 200 men in the attack, but the true figure was probably somewhat higher. One French soldier was lightly wounded. On 3 November a force of Chinese marauders approached Keelung from the south and tried to rush Cramoisy Pagoda, but were repelled without difficulty by its defenders. The attack was probably made by the Chinese in the hope that the French had lowered their guard after the failure of the previous day's assault.
Following the failure of these attacks Liu Ming-ch'uan began to invest Keelung. He ordered the town's inhabitants to leave their homes, thereby denying the French their services as cooks, laundrymen and labourers, and he fortified a number of hill positions to the south and southeast of Keelung. The Chinese built major forts on the summits of Shih-ch'iu-ling (獅球嶺), Hung-tan-shan (紅淡山) and Yueh-mei-shan (月眉山), linking them with an elaborate trench system. These forts were christened respectively by the French La Dent ('the fang'), Fort Bamboo and La Table. From its distinctive shape, Hung-tan-shan became Le Cirque ('the corry'). On 13 and 14 November the French destroyed the Chinese defences on the summit of Hung-tan-shan and burned the village of Nai-nin-ka (南寧腳) to the southeast of Shih-ch'iu-ling, which the Chinese were using as a supply depot. On 12 December the French captured and partly demolished the Shih-ch'iu-ling fort (La Dent), but were forced to withdraw by a Chinese counterattack. On each occasion the Chinese quickly made good the damage.
Although French losses in these engagements with Liu Ming-ch'uan's army were negligible, the Formosa expeditionary corps suffered heavy casualties from disease. An outbreak of cholera and typhus in November 1884 killed 83 French soldiers by 23 December and incapacitated hundreds more. On 1 December 1884 only 1,100 French soldiers were fit were action, half the number who had landed at Keelung two months earlier. French officers with long memories compared the occupation of Keelung with the siege of Tourane twenty-five years earlier, where an initial victory had been succeeded by a costly and protracted stalemate and, ultimately, an ignominious evacuation by the invaders.
French offensive, 25–31 January 1885.
Towards the end of 1884 the French were able to enforce a limited blockade of the northern Formosan port of Tamsui and the southern ports of Tai-wan-fu (台灣府, modern Tainan, 台南) and Takow (打狗, modern Kaohsiung, 高雄). The blockade was relatively ineffective, and was unable to prevent the Chinese from using the Pescadores Islands as a staging post for landing large numbers of troops in southern Formosa. Substantial drafts from the Hunan and Anhui Armies raised the strength of Liu Ming-ch'uan's defending army to around 25,000 men by the end of the year, and to around 35,000 men in April 1885.
The Chinese forces around Keelung consisted for the most part of regular soldiers from Fukien and from the northern provinces around the Gulf of Petchili. The French considered them to be the cream of the Chinese army. The men were tall and sturdy, and wore a practical dark blue cloth uniform consisting of baggy trousers reaching to mid-calf and a loose shirt decorated with a large scarlet badge inscribed with characters in black indicating their battalion and company. Leggings and felt-soled slippers completed their normal dress, and they were also issued with a light rain cape either of wool or waterproofed with fish paste. Their equipment included German-made belts, scabbards and ammunition pouches (the latter much admired by the French, who replaced their own 1882 pattern pouches whenever they could). Unlike the French, they did not carry haversacks. Most of them were armed with Lee rifles, though Mausers, Winchesters and Remingtons were also popular and the bodyguards of the senior mandarins were armed, as befitted their prestige, with the latest Hotchkiss carbines. They were abundantly supplied with ammunition.
Liu Ming-ch'uan also raised a corps of local Hakka militia under the command of Lin Ch'ao-tung (林朝棟), and at one point even recruited a band of head-hunting aborigines from the untamed central mountain region of Formosa. These illiterate tribesmen had long been accustomed to raid the peaceful Chinese villages of the plain, and Liu Ming-ch'uan seized the opportunity to divert their warlike energies against the French. In the event, the tribesmen were of little military value to the Chinese. They were armed only with matchlock rifles loaded with stone bullets. Captain Paul Thirion, whose marine infantry company met them in battle during a skirmish on 20 November 1884, claimed that a gang of small boys throwing stones would have put up a better fight.
In one engagement on 8 October 1884 , the Taiwanese aborigines, called Formosan "hillmen", beheaded French soldiers and put their heads up on display in the markets.
"A most unmistakable scene in the market place occurred. Some six heads of Frenchmen, heads of the true French type were exhibited, much to the disgust of foreigners. A few visited the place where they were stuck up, and were glad to leave it—not only on account of the disgusting and barbarous character of the scene, but because tlio surrounding crowd shewed signs of turbulence. At the camp also were eight other Frenchmen's heads, a sight which might have satisfied a savage or a Hill-man, but hardly consistent with the comparatively enlightened tastes, one would think, of Chinese soldiers even of to-day. It is not known how many of the French were killed and wounded; fourteen left their bodies on shore, and no doubt several wounded were taken back to the ships. (Chinese accounts state that twenty were killed and large numbers wounded.)
In the evening Captain Boteler and Consul Frater called on General Sun, remonstrating with him on the subject of cutting heads off, and allowing them to be exhibited. Consul Frater wrote him a despatch on the subject strongly deprecating such practices, aud we understand that the general promised it should not occur again, and orders were at once given to bury the heads. It is difficult for a general even situated as Sun is—having to command troops like the Hillmen, who are the veriest savages in the treatment of their enemies—to prevent such barbarities.
"It is said the Chinese buried the dead bodies of the Frenchmen after the engagement on 8th instant by order of General Sun. The Chinesse are in possession of a machine gun taken or found on the beach.

In early January 1885 the Formosa expeditionary corps was substantially reinforced with two battalions of infantry, bringing its total strength to around 4,000 men. Four of the six companies of the 3rd African Light Infantry Battalion ("chef de bataillon" Fontebride) arrived in Keelung on 6 January, and all four companies of the 4th Foreign Legion Battalion ("chef de bataillon" Vitalis) disembarked on 20 January. Command of the expanded expeditionary corps was given to Lieutenant-Colonel Jacques Duchesne (1837–1918), the future French general and conqueror of Madagascar, who had recently made his name in Tonkin by defeating Liu Yung-fu's Black Flag Army in the Battle of Yu Oc (19 November 1884) and fighting his way through to the isolated French post of Tuyen Quang.
The African Battalion reinforcements soon blooded themselves, but not in accordance with Duchesne's plans. On 10 January 1885 a party of 15 bored "zéphyrs" under the command of Corporal Mourier escaped from their barracks and launched an impromptu attack on Le Cirque. Their aim, apparently, was to capture the Chinese flag floating above the ramparts of Fort Bamboo and bring it back to Keelung. Mourier and his men soon came under fire, and Fontebride was forced to commit all four companies of the battalion one after another to disengage them. By mid-afternoon the entire African Battalion was deployed in line, in the open, halfway up the slopes of Hung-tan-shan, exchanging fire with the Chinese defenders of Fort Bamboo. Courbet and Duchesne, furious at this reckless, unauthorised attack, ordered Fontebride to extricate the battalion immediately. French casualties in this 'reconnaissance' (as Courbet prudently called it in his official report) were 17 dead and 28 wounded. Chinese casualties were almost certainly higher, as their positions were shelled by the French artillery during the engagement. The survivors of Mourier's party (several of them were killed during the attack) were jailed for 60 days.
Two weeks later the French attacked the Chinese lines in a more orderly manner. On 25 January 1885 Duchesne launched an offensive aimed at capturing the key Chinese position of La Table (Yueh-mei-shan). In three days of fighting the French captured the subsidiary position of Fork Y, enabling their artillery to enfilade the main Chinese defences, but on 28 January torrential rain halted the offensive before the French could assault La Table itself. A Chinese counterattack on Fork Y during the night of 31 January was decisively repulsed by the French with rifle fire at point-blank range. French casualties in the actions of 25 to 31 January were 21 dead and 62 wounded, mostly in the Legion and African battalions. Chinese casualties, mostly sustained in the disastrous counterattack on 31 January, probably amounted to at least 2,000 men. The dead included the battalion commander Chang Jen-kuei (張仁貴), a bandit chief from Ilan who had contributed a force of 200 militiamen to Ts’ao Chih-chung's command.
Duchesne was anxious to follow up this limited victory with a further attack on La Table, but heavy rain continued throughout February. No serious troop movements were possible during this period. In mid-February the Chinese bombarded the French positions from La Table with Congreve rockets, but without doing any damage. French artillery fired back, and a lucky shot blew up an ammunition dump on La Table. Thereafter the Chinese left the French in peace.
Duchesne decided to occupy Fork Y, as its possession allowed the French to enfilade long stretches of the Chinese trench lines linking their forts on Yueh-mei-shan and Hung-tan-shan, and Legion and "zéphyr" garrisons took turn and turn about to hold this position during the chills and rains of February. The French troops soon renamed Fork Y Fort Misery:
Our stay at Fort Misery was dreadful. The rain never let up. It pricked our faces like icicles, put out fires we had spent hours lighting, turned our campsite into a bog and washed out the dye from our clothes. The men slept on beds of liquid mud. Their uniforms, filthy and faded, were a disgraceful sight. As for the Annamese coolies, shivering with cold and fever, we could hardly bear to look at them. Most of them were now clad in French hand-me-downs, which they had either filched from the field hospital or been given by kind-hearted soldiers. The unlucky ones, still clad only in a scanty loincloth, wrapped themselves in sheets or blankets to stay as warm as they could.
French offensive, 4–7 March 1885.
The rain finally stopped on 2 March, and two days later Duchesne launched a second, highly successful offensive. In a series of actions fought between 4 and 7 March, the French broke the Chinese encirclement of Keelung with a flank attack delivered against the east of the Chinese line, defeating Chinese forces under the command of Ts'ao Chih-chung, Wang Shih-cheng (王詩正) and Lin Ch'ao-tung (林朝棟), capturing the key positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo, and forcing the Chinese to withdraw behind the Keelung River.
Duchesne committed 1,300 troops to his attack column. The column contained six companies of the 4th Legion and 3rd African battalions and three companies of marine infantry. Artillery support was provided by three guns under the command of Captain de Champglen and by the gunboat "Vipère", which took up a position off Pei-tao from which it could bombard the Chinese positions on Yueh-mei-shan and in the Keelung River valley.
On 4 March the French made a bold outflanking march eastwards towards Pei-tao (八堵), occupying the summits of Wu-k'eng-shan (五坑山) and Shen-ou-shan (深澳山).
At dawn on 5 March they descended into the Shen-ou-k'eng (深澳坑) valley and marched southwards to place themselves dead on the flank of the Chinese line. In the early afternoon they scaled Liu-k'eng-shan (六坑山) from the east and laboriously ascended the eastern face of Yueh-mei-shan (月眉山), approaching the Chinese positions without being spotted. Late in the afternoon they captured La Table with a simultaneous frontal and flanking attack, supported by rifle and artillery fire from the French forward positions on Fork Y. The French guns on Fork Y, firing over open sights at a right angle to the axis of the attack, pounded the Chinese positions as the French infantry closed in on La Table, lifting their fire only seconds before the attackers reached the Chinese defences.
On 6 March the attack column, reinforced by two Legion companies previously stationed on Fork Y, paused to resupply with food and ammunition.
On the morning of 7 March the French thrust westwards from Yueh-mei-shan and fought their way to the summit of Hung-tan-shan, where they stormed Fort Bamboo. The attackers were aided by a diversionary attack mounted by Cramoisy's marine infantry company from the Keelung garrison, which had stealthily occupied a hill position to the west of Fort Bamboo during the previous night. Cramoisy's "marsouins" disclosed themselves as Fontebride's "zéphyrs" approached Fort Bamboo from the east, disorganising the Chinese defenders with a devastating volley from behind their positions. The hoisting of the French tricolour above Fort Bamboo was greeted by the ships of the Far East squadron lying in Keelung harbour with blasts on their foghorns, and by cheers from the French troops echeloned back along the line of advance on the summits of Yueh-mei-shan and Liu-k'eng-shan.
In the afternoon of 7 March a mixed column of legionnaires, "zéphyrs" and marine infantry attacked southwards along the ridge of Niao-tsui-chien (鳥嘴尖), against determined enemy resistance. The struggle for Niao-tsui-chien saw the fiercest fighting of the four-day campaign. The Chinese held the peaks, and rolled rocks down on the advancing French. One Chinese infantry unit, concealed in a wood, opened fire on the French at almost point-blank range and inflicted heavy casualties on the 3rd African Battalion. The French eventually pushed the Chinese off the ridges, and just before sunset drove them back through the village of Loan-loan (Nuan-nuan, 暖暖).
Some French troops attempted to cross the Keelung River in abandoned Chinese sampans, but they were promptly recalled by Duchesne, who had no wish to fight a confusing night action south of the river. At nightfall Duchesne halted the pursuit and regrouped his troops on the northern bank of the Keelung River.
On 8 March the French consolidated their positions around Loan-loan. On 9 March the Chinese withdrew from Shih-ch'iu-ling, which could no longer be held with Hung-tan-shan in French hands, and fell back behind the Keelung River.
French casualties in the March offensive were 41 killed and 157 wounded. Chinese losses may have amounted to around 1,500 killed and wounded. The French also captured a battery of modern German Krupp cannon that had been brought into Formosa by the British blockade-runner "Waverley" and had just been emplaced on La Table. These guns had fired a few rounds during the battle, but the Chinese had been unable to fuse the shells properly and they had failed to explode on impact. Had the French attack been delayed for a few more days, the Chinese might have been able to shell the French out of their forts around Keelung and force them to withdraw behind the hills of the Ber Lines. Duchesne's offensive had been launched in the very nick of time.
The capture of La Table and Fort Bamboo, although it had been bought at a heavy cost, was a remarkable victory for the French. Duchesne's men had been asked to make an arduous approach march of more than 100 kilometres through unfamiliar countryside and then to fight two major battles in the confusing, heavily wooded, mountainous terrain to the south of Keelung. This spectacular feat of arms, perhaps the most impressive French professional triumph of the Sino-French War, was overshadowed at the time by the news of the relief of the Siege of Tuyen Quang on 3 March 1885, and remains largely unknown to this day in France.
Pescadores campaign, 25–29 March 1885.
Duchesne's victory enabled Admiral Courbet to detach a marine infantry battalion from the Keelung garrison to capture the Pescadores Islands in late March. Strategically, the Pescadores Campaign was an important victory, which would have prevented the Chinese from further reinforcing their army in Formosa, but it came too late to affect the outcome of the war.
Final skirmishes around Keelung, March–April 1885.
Despite his defeat Liu Ming-ch'uan remained as resilient as ever. In mid-March he began to fortify a new Chinese defensive line south of the Keelung River and along the Lok-tao (Liu-tu, 六堵) and Chit-tao (Ch'i-tu, 七堵) heights to the west of Keelung, covering the approaches to Tai-pak-fu (台北府) and Tamsui. The news of Duchesne's victory sparked a brief panic in Tai-pak-fu, and militia units were hastily raised to defend the town against a possible French attack.
But the French were not strong enough to advance beyond their bridgehead at Keelung, particularly after the detachments made from the Keelung garrison for the Pescadores Campaign. They contented themselves with occupying Hung-tan-shan and Yueh-mei-shan, replacing Fort Bamboo and La Table with two identically named forts of their own. Two more forts, Fort Bertin and Southern Fort ("Fort du Sud"), were built above Loan-loan and on the lower slopes of Hung-tan-shan, overlooking the Keelung River.
The Keelung Campaign now reached a point of equilibrium. The French were holding a virtually impregnable defensive perimeter around Keelung but could not exploit their success, while Liu Ming-ch'uan's army remained in presence just beyond their advanced positions. The Chinese attempted to disrupt work on the construction of Fort Bertin, uncomfortably close to their forward positions, and there were one or two minor skirmishes around the new fort in late March in which several French soldiers were wounded. However, neither the French nor the Chinese undertook any major operations. During the first fortnight of April the French and Chinese outposts occasionally exchanged shots, but no casualties were suffered by either side.
At the end of March 1885 French reverses in Tonkin overshadowed Duchesne's achievement at Keelung. The shocking news of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger’s retreat from Lang Son on 28 March reached Courbet at Makung on 4 April 1885, in the form of a navy ministry despatch brought from Hong Kong by the cruiser "Roland". Courbet was ordered to evacuate Keelung and return to Tonkin with the bulk of the Formosa expeditionary corps, leaving only a small French garrison at Makung in the Pescadores. In the second week of April Courbet and Duchesne drew up a plan for an opposed evacuation of Keelung, involving a carefully phased daylight withdrawal from the frontline forts to the harbour. A small rearguard would be left to hold the approaches to the harbour while the evacuation proceeded, supported by the guns of the Far East squadron. In the event this plan was never implemented, as preliminaries of peace between France and China were concluded on 4 April 1885, bringing the Sino-French War to an end. On 10 April Courbet was ordered to suspend plans for an immediate evacuation of Keelung, and on 14 April he was notified of the conclusion of preliminaries of peace ten days earlier. Hostilities around Keelung now came to an end.
Japanese interest in the Keelung campaign.
The French endeavours at Keelung were of great interest to another predatory power in the region, the Empire of Japan. In 1874 the Japanese had sent a punitive expedition to southern Taiwan, following the murder of shipwrecked Japanese sailors by Taiwanese aborigines, and Japanese expansionists already had their eye on Taiwan as a future Japanese colony. Following the failure of the Gapsin Coup in Korea in December 1884, Japan began to look ahead to an eventual showdown with China. Although France and Japan never became formal allies during the Sino-French War (despite Chinese fears of such a possibility), Japan's naval and military leaders observed the performance of Admiral Courbet's squadron and Colonel Duchesne's Formosa expeditionary corps with keen professional interest. The Japanese captain Tōgō Heihachirō, the future commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy, visited Keelung during the war aboard the corvette "Amagi" and was briefed by French officers on the tactics the French were using against the Chinese. Togo's guide was the young French engineering captain Joseph Joffre, who had been sent to Keelung to lay out the new French forts after Duchesne's March victory. Commander-in-chief of the French Army at the start of the First World War and victor of the crucial Battle of the Marne in 1914, Joffre would end his military career as a Marshal of France.
French evacuation of Keelung, June 1885.
The Formosa expeditionary corps continued to occupy Keelung and Makung for several months after the end of the Sino-French War as a surety for the withdrawal of Chinese forces from Tonkin. During this period a battalion of marine infantry and a newly arrived marine artillery battery were withdrawn from the Keelung garrison to take part in a French punitive campaign in Madagascar.
Keelung was finally evacuated on 22 June 1885. Under arrangements agreed between Liu Ming-ch'uan and Admiral Lespès on 17 June, the French withdrew from their forts on Hung-tan-shan and Yueh-mei-shan in stages, over a three-day period, and their positions were reoccupied by the Chinese only after a prudent delay. The Chinese officers kept their men well in hand, and the occupation of the French forts was conducted with dignity and restraint. 'There was not the slightest demonstration of triumph, nothing that could hurt our feelings, nothing that could wound our legitimate pride,' wrote one French officer. The French flag that had flown above Keelung for eight months was lowered to a 21-gun salute from the ironclad "La Galissonnière". Colonel Duchesne, the commander of the Formosa expeditionary corps, was the last French soldier to embark aboard the waiting transports. The men of the Formosa expeditionary corps were ferried either to Makung in the Pescadores, which would remain in French hands for another month, or to Along Bay in Tonkin, to rejoin the Tonkin expeditionary corps.
By June 1885 Keelung was virtually unrecognisable as a Chinese town. Although its temples had been respected by the occupiers, many of its houses had been demolished to provide fields of fire for the French garrison, and the remaining buildings had been whitewashed and decorated in the French mode. The French had also built a network of broad avenues and boulevards through the town, and turned the waterfront into an esplanade, complete with bandstand. The Canadian missionary George MacKay mentioned that Keelung was reoccupied by its former inhabitants as soon as the French warships steamed out of the harbour, but he did not comment on their reaction to the transformation that had taken place in their absence. Before long, however, Keelung was once again its former self.
The French cemetery in Keelung.
Only one trace remains today of the French occupation. At the request of Admiral Lespès, Liu Ming-ch'uan undertook to respect the cemetery in which the French war dead had been buried. This promise was kept, and the French cemetery in Keelung can still be seen today. The French dead, between 600 and 700 soldiers and sailors (most of them victims of cholera and typhoid rather than battle casualties), were originally buried in a cemetery further to the north, close to the Erh-sha-wan battery, and their remains were transferred to the present cemetery in 1909. The French cemetery contains only two named graves, those of "sous-commissaire" Marie-Joseph-Louis Dert and Lieutenant Louis Jehenne. Ironically, these two marine infantry officers died not in Keelung but in Makung in the Pescadores Islands, in June 1885, and their remains were exhumed and transferred to the Keelung cemetery in 1954.

Newton–Cartan theory

Newton–Cartan theory is a geometrical re-formulation, as well as a generalization, of Newtonian gravity developed by Élie Cartan. In this re-formulation, the structural similarities between Newton's theory and Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity are readily seen, and it has been used by Cartan and Kurt Friedrichs to give a rigorous formulation of the way in which Newtonian gravity can be seen as a specific limit of general relativity, and by Jürgen Ehlers to extend this correspondence to specific solutions of general relativity.
Geometric formulation of Poisson's equation.
In Newton's theory of gravitation, Poisson's equation reads
where formula_2 is the gravitational potential, formula_3 is the gravitational constant and formula_4 is the mass density. The weak equivalence principle motivates a geometric version of the equation of motion for a point particle in the potential formula_5
where formula_7 is the inertial mass and formula_8 the gravitational mass. Since, according to the weak equivalence principle formula_9, the according equation of motion
doesn't contain anymore a reference to the mass of the particle. Following the idea that the solution of the equation then is a property of the curvature of space, a connection is constructed so that the geodesic equation
represents the equation of motion of a point particle in the potential formula_2. The resulting connection is
with formula_14 and formula_15 (formula_16). The connection has been constructed in one inertial system but can be shown to be valid in any inertial system by showing the invariance of formula_17 and formula_18 under Galilei-transformations. The Riemann curvature tensor in inertial system coordinates of this connection is then given by
where the brackets formula_20 mean the antisymmetric combination of the tensor formula_21. The Ricci tensor is given by
which leads to following geometric formulation of Poisson's equation
Bargmann lift.
It was shown that four-dimensional Newton–Cartan theory of gravitation can be reformulated as Kaluza–Klein reduction of five-dimensional Einstein gravity along a null-like direction. This lifting is considered to be useful for non-relativistic holographic models.

Hand-in-waistcoat

The hand-in-waistcoat was a gesture commonly found in men's portraiture during the 18th and 19th centuries. Napoleon I of France was most well known for the gesture and is readily associated with this gesture because of the several portraits made by his artist, Jacques-Louis David. Theories state the gesture was done by Napoleon because of a stomach pain he had, but the pose was common in portraits from the mid-18th century. Along with this, many people state he had an itchy skin disease, or possible even breast cancer. The pose originates from classical times — Aeschines, founder of a rhetoric school, suggested that speaking with an arm outside one's toga was rude.

Cliff Swain

Cliff Swain is the second player with the most tournament wins in professional racquetball history. He began playing the pro tour - International Racquetball Tour (IRT) - in the 1980s and continued doing so into the 2000s. Known for his great drive serve and on court intensity, the left-handed Swain was a dominant player in the 1990s finishing as the #1 IRT player in 5 seasons during that decade. Swain retired from the IRT following the 2006-07 season, but did play some tournaments in the 2008-09 IRT season. He recently competed in the 2013 US Open, and defeated several top pros before losing in the round of 16. He also played on the Classic Pro Racquetball Tour (CPRT) for former pro players over 40 in the 2008-09 season. Swain was inducted into the USA Racquetball Hall of Fame in 2003.
Early years.
Cliff Swain was born on March 21, 1966 in San Jose, California and was raised in Braintree, Massachusetts. Swain was introduced to racquetball by his father, Robert "Red" Swain, a competitive handball player when Cliff was 13 years old. Swain was naturally talented and quickly picked up the game, soon winning Massachusetts State and New England Regional Junior Racquetball Championships. In 1983 Cliff Swain won the US Junior National 16 and Under Racquetball Championship. In 1984 Swain won the Orange Bowl World 18 and Under Junior Racquetball Championship. Swain played on the racquetball team at Providence College in 1984 before turning professional.
Professional career.
Swain's 71 IRT tournament wins is more than any other IRT player (Marty Hogan is second with 60), and he has also played more tournaments 277 than any other player (second is Ruben Gonzalez at 216). In addition Swain holds the record for the most professional match wins with 730, next is Marty Hogan with 506 wins. Swain's career highlights are his two US Open Racquetball Championships in 1997 and 2001. Swain was the season end #1 IRT player 6 times: 1990, 1993–95, 1998 and 2002.
Swain won his first professional racquetball title in 1985 at the Tulsa Open in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Swain went on to win the 1985 Ektelon National Championship in his first season on tour, consecutively beating racquetball legends, Marty Hogan, Dave Peck and Greg Peck. Swain was named the Professional Racquetball Rookie of the Year in 1985. Cliff remained one of the top ten professional players from 1985 to 1989. In 1990 Swain finished the year as the number one ranked player in the world for the first time. Swain would go on to finish number one five more times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2002. Swain won over eighty tournaments in his pro career including the 1997 and 2001 US Open Racquetball Championships.
In 2003, Swain was inducted into the USA Racquetball Hall of Fame. In 2004 and 2005 Cliff played the Legends Racquetball Tour winning the Legends 35+ National Championship both years. Cliff Swain teamed with fellow racquetball legend, Marty Hogan to win the 2004 and 2005 Legends National Doubles Championships. In 2008 Cliff Swain teamed with Woody Clouse to win the 40+ USA Racquetball National Doubles Championship. In 2012, he teamed up with long time friend Mike Ladge and has won 3 national 45 + doubles titles: The 2012 Ektelon US Nationals, the 2012 US Open, and the 2013 Ektelon US Nationals.
Swain would likely have won more racquetball tournaments, but in 1990 at the age of 24, he left racquetball for 2 seasons when he was #1 to pursue a tennis career at the encouragement of Ion Tiriac, one time coach of Boris Becker. That pursuit lasted two years and although Swain had some success, it was not nearly at the level he had experienced in racquetball. When he returned the next season, he reclaimed the #1 ranking.
Coaching
Although Swain still competes in professional tournaments, he is also coaching some of the best players in the game including World Junior Champion and Women's Touring Pro Maria Jose Vargas who in 10 months went from amateur to #6 in the world and Brad Schopieray ranked #18 on the Men's Pro Tour.

Miller House (Columbus, Indiana)

The Miller House and Garden, also known as Miller House, is a Mid-Century modern home designed by Eero Saarinen and located in Columbus, Indiana, United States. The residence, commissioned by American industrialist, philanthropist, and architecture patron J. Irwin Miller and his wife Xenia Simons Miller in 1953, is now owned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Miller supported modern architecture in the construction of a number of buildings throughout Columbus, Indiana. Design and construction on the Miller House took four years and was completed in 1957. The home was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2000. The Miller family owned the home until 2008, when Xenia Miller, the last resident of the home, died.
In 2009, the home and gardens, along with many of the original furnishings, were donated to the Indianapolis Museum of Art by members of the Miller family. In addition to Eero Saarinen, the house and gardens showcases the work of leading 20th-century figures such as interior designer Alexander Girard, landscape architect Dan Kiley, and principal design associate at the Saarinen office, Kevin Roche.
Architecture.
As a friend of J. Irwin and Xenia Miller, Eero Saarinen had first designed a summer house in the Muskoka region of Ontario, Canada for the family and was then asked to conceptualize and build the Miller House in Columbus, Indiana. The Miller house was meant to be a year-round residence, rather than just a vacation home. The Millers wanted a home in which they could entertain heads of states and titans of industry. At about 6,838 square feet, the Miller House is one of very few single family homes that Saarinen designed.
The Miller House epitomizes the modernist architectural tradition developed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe with its open and flowing layout, flat roof, and stone and glass walls. Within the interior of the home, four non-public areas branch off from a central space, which features a conversation pit. These four branches include rooms for parents, children, guests and servants, and utilitarian areas (kitchen and laundry). The plan avoids a conventional axial organization, instead displacing the hierarchy of the rooms with a more egalitarian and functional arrangement. The geometry of the house's plan is similar to Andrea Palladio's 16th-century Villa Rotunda in its organization of rooms around a central space.
A grid pattern of skylights, supported by sixteen free-standing cruciform steel columns, show concern for the play of light and shadow. A cylindrical fireplace, a 50-foot long storage wall, and the sunken conversation pit are key elements of the modern design of the central space. 
The completed house was photographed in 1958 by Ezra Stoller for an article that appeared in The Architecture Forum. The Millers made only minor changes to the house over the years, including the removal of an interior wall in order to enlarge a guest room.
Landscape architecture.
Saarinen brought in landscape architect Dan Kiley, with whom he had worked on the St. Louis Gateway Arch. Kiley wanted the landscape to be an extension of the home, loosely divided into four sections extending from the corresponding sections of the house, each with its own identity. The Miller House is an example of residential landscape design that puts a modernist face on formal European gardens, which rely on symmetry and geometry.
The plot of land, bounded by the Flatrock River on the west and Washington Street on the east, measures about 13.5 acres. Kiley left the long meadow that sweeps toward the river largely untouched, choosing to focus his attention on shaping spaces around the house. Much of the vegetation, like the weeping beeches on the west side of the house, were placed there strategically to protect living areas from natural intruders like sun and wind.
An allée of horse chestnut trees lines the entry drive, which reveals the house slowly as one approaches. The Miller's did not want their home to be an imposing object in the landscape from the entrance of their property or from their neighbor's homes. Gridded blocks of apple trees are present on the lawn farther east. The easternmost edge of the property is planted with staggered blocks of arborvitae, creating a hedge that serves as a porous boundary. The garden areas to the north of the house were originally planted with redbuds, which were later replaced with crabapples. In the southwest corner there is a swimming pool also surrounded by arborvitae hedges.
One of the most notable features of the landscape design is the allée of honey locust trees that runs along the west side of the house which frames the view of the meadow and the river beyond it. The allée received a terminus at each end in subsequent years: Henry Moore’s "Draped Reclining Woman" at the north end, and a bas relief by Jacques Lipchitz at the south. As part of a landscape renovation conducted by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, Inc. of Cambridge, MA, the Honey Locust allée was replanted in the Spring of 2008. The iconic Moore sculpture was sold and removed from garden following Xenia Miller's death in 2008.
Interior design.
Architect and interior designer Alexander Girard worked closely with the Millers to furnish the residence. His choices for fabrics, textiles, furniture, and ornaments are said to bring warmth and color to the rectilinearity and geometry of the house. 
Girard designed a 50-foot storage wall made up of cabinets, bookshelves, and niches that allow equipment to remain hidden while the Millers' eclectic objects can be displayed. Some of these objects included folk art from Mexico, Asia and Eastern Europe. He designed patterns for many of the curtains in the house, as well as several rugs. One of the latter is composed of emblems that represent family history and interests. His designs for cushions for the dining room chairs feature the initials of family members. Girard is credited with suggesting the idea of the conversation pit, which eliminates the look of cluttered seating in the expansive living room, reinforcing the linearity of the architecture.
