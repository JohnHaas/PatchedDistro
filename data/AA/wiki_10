Fish Rising

Fish Rising is the debut solo album by English guitarist Steve Hillage, recorded and released in 1975 (see 1975 in music).
The album was recorded just prior to Hillage's departure from the band Gong, and many of the players on this album are from that band: Bassist Mike Howlett, drummer Pierre Moerlen, keyboardist Tim Blake and saxophonist Didier Malherbe. 
In 2007, Virgin issued a re-mastered version with two bonus tracks. "Pentagrammaspin" had originally appeared on the Virgin "V" sampler album in 1975, and the "power trio" backing version of "Aftaglid" consisted of Hillage, Howlett and Moerlen.

Underwater search and recovery

Underwater search and recovery is the process of locating and recovering underwater objects by divers.
Most underwater search and recovery is done by professional divers as part of commercial marine salvage operations, military operations, emergency services, or law enforcement activities.
Minor aspects of search and recovery are also considered within the scope of recreational diving.
Professional search and recovery.
The scope of professional search and recovery includes the following applications:
Recreational search and recovery.
Search and recovery diving is also frequently undertaken as part of recreational diving, and most diver training organisations have dedicated training courses on the subject. Search and recovery is generally considered a more hazardous speciality diving course.
Underwater search and recovery used to form a mandatory component of the Advanced Open Water Diver training course for many North American diver training agencies, which, in addition to learning basic search and recover skills, also assisted in teaching students to cope with task loading.
Although the scale, value and equipment used in commercial and recreational search and recovery are enormously different, the basic premise remains the same in each case.
Search.
Underwater searches, much like above water searches, are designed around specific search patterns. The most common forms of underwater search patterns are:
The patterns are usually performed by divers in pairs or teams below the water, but they can also be conducted by use of a tender who may be a snorkeller at the surface, a person on a towing boat, or a person located on the shore.
In simple search operations, the patterns will usually be conducted by the divers simply looking visually for the object. In more sophisticated search operations, underwater magnetometers or hand held sonar may be used.
Types.
Diver training traditionally divides searches into two categories, "specific" and "non-specific".
A "specific" search is an attempt to locate a known object in a known area where it was believed to be lost even if the time period is undefined, and the search terminates upon the location of the object. The classic example of this would be an item lost overboard from a boat, which needs to be recovered.
A "non-specific" search is a search for either a type of object or anything valuable within the dive locale. Usually the discovery of a relevant object does not usually terminate the search until the entire search area has been covered, or the search terminates early for other reasons (air supply, no decompression limits, etc.).
Recovery.
Recovery techniques depend upon the type and size of the object.
Smaller objects, such as a coin or camera, can simply be carried up by the diver. Training agencies vary in what they specify to be the maximum weight that can be safely carried up unassisted, but normally the limit is set around . Anything heavier represents a material change to the diver's buoyancy control, and may put the diver at risk from an uncontrolled ascent if contact with the object is lost during ascent.
Medium sized objects are normally recovered using a lifting bag, and students are trained in lifting bag technique. The most common hazard is entanglement with lines whilst filling the lifting bag from the diver's alternate air source. This risk, when coupled with the possibility of rapid ascent following the freeing of the object from suction caused by it resting upon the sea bed, can seriously compromise the safety of the recovery team if done improperly. Lift bags can be rated up to several tons, but these are beyond the capacity of most recreational divers.
Significantly larger objects usually require specialised commercial lifting equipment, either a winch attached to a boat or platform, or specialised equipment to seal and inflate sunken vessels.

<doc id="18264706" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18264706" title="Ring Protection">
Ring Protection

In Telecommunication networks, ring topology is often used. These ring networks can be self healing which is necessary to ensure up time in the telecommunication industry. There are two widely used protection architectures.
1+1 Ring Protection.
In one plus one (1+1) architecture, a single protection path is used to protect the signal. In this case the bridge at the head of the path is permanent. It is at the tail end where the switching occurs. In this architecture traffic is sent over two parallel routes, and the destination or the receiving end selects the better of these two signals. In case of any failure, the destination switches onto the alternative path/route. This architecture is simple for implementation and results fast restoration. Its major drawback is the wastage of bandwidth, since no traffic travels through the redundant path.
1:1 Ring Protection.
In 1:1 architecture, the signal is protected by a single protection path where the bridge at the head end is not permanent. When the primary path fails it switches to the alternate path. During normal operation, no traffic or low priority traffic is sent through the redundant path. When any failure occurs, both the source and destination switch onto the redundant or alternate path. Although network utilization is better in this architecture but it requires signaling overhead and also results in slower restoration.

USNS Sgt. Sylvester Antolak (T-AP-192)

USNS "Sgt. Sylvester Antolak" (AP-192/T-AP-192) was a that served as a United States Army Transport, and in the United States Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service, in the post-World War II period.
The ship was a VC2-S-AP-2 type Victory ship built under a Maritime Commission contract (MCV hull 830). Laid down as the "Stetson Victory" on 3 May 1945 by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, and launched on 16 June 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Joe Hendricks; and delivered to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration on 18 July 1945 for operation by Isbrandtsen Co., Inc.
Service history.
US Army service.
After operating under government contract for a year, "Stetson Victory" was returned to the War Shipping Administration in July 1946, and was transferred to the War Department for operation by the Army. Renamed USAT Sgt. Sylvester Antolak on 31 October 1947, the ship carried Army passengers and cargo across the globe. On 2 December 1948, the troop transport left Yokohama, Japan, with over 1,000 officers and enlisted men of 317th Troop Carrier Wing (Heavy) embarked. After a 40-day voyage the ship arrived in Bremerhaven, Germany, on 9 January 1949, delivering the personnel in support of the Berlin Airlift. The transport was then returned to the Maritime Commission for berthing at Suisun Bay, California, in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.
Korean War.
On 22 July 1950, shortly after the start of the Korean War, she was reactivated by the Navy for operation by the Military Sea Transportation Service. Following minor alterations, including the addition of limited medical spaces, USNS "Sgt. Sylvester Antolak" (T-AP-192) sailed from San Francisco on 24 August to transport troops to Yokohama, Japan. She remained in the western Pacific, shuttling troops from Japan, as well as the Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea (PEFTOK), into June 1951; then returned to the United States to embark more soldiers for transportation to the Far East. She continued to carry American troops on trans-Pacific voyages and shuttle runs between Japanese ports and between Japan and Korea until April 1952. She then operated briefly along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean until June, when she retransited the Panama Canal to resume operations in the Pacific. By the end of July, she had conducted a round-trip run to Bangkok out of Sasebo and was en route to the Aleutian Islands, whence she returned to the west coast for inactivation.
"Sgt. Sylvester Antolak" arrived at Seattle on 10 August and was returned to the Maritime Administration on 17 September for berthing in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 6 November 1952. In December 1971, "Sgt. Sylvester Antolak" was sold for scrap by the Maritime Administration.

Kia Forte

The Kia Forte is a compact car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Kia Motors since mid-2008. It replaced the Kia Cerato and is available in two-door coupé, four-door sedan, five-door hatchback variants. It is not available in Europe, where the similar sized Kia Cee'd is offered (except for Russia and Ukraine, where the Cee'd and the Forte are both available). In South Korea, this car is marketed as the Kia K3.
In some markets, such as Costa Rica, Australia and Brazil, the Forte is marketed as the Kia Cerato replacing its predecessor of the same name. In Colombia and Singapore, the name Kia Cerato Forte is used, while Naza of Malaysia has assembled the vehicle since 2009, selling it there under the name Naza Forte.
__TOC__
First generation (2009–2013).
The first generation Forte shares the same platform as the Hyundai Elantra (HD), though employing a torsion-beam rear suspension in place of the Elantra's multilink design.
Kia has stated that the Forte was specifically designed to target younger buyers attracted to sharper auto designs.
In Malaysia, the first generation Forte retains its name while the second generation model is sold as the Cerato.
Coupe (Koup).
The two-door coupe "Forte Koup" was originally unveiled as a concept car in the form of the "Kia Koup" on March 20, 2008 at the New York International Auto Show. The concept sported a twin scroll turbocharged version of the 2.0-liter "Theta II" inline-four engine. The production Forte Koup is badged as the "Kia Cerato Koup" in Australia, Costa Rica and South Africa. It is called the "Kia Shuma" in China, and "Kia Koup" in Chile.
Sedan.
The Forte sedan was designed in Kia's California design studio by Tom Kearns and his team. The Forte two-door ("Koup") was previewed as the "Kia Koup" Concept, and was also designed in Kia's California design studio. The Korean model went on sale on August 22, 2008. The US model was unveiled at the 2009 Chicago Auto Show.
Hatchback.
The Forte hatchback five-door debuted at the 2010 New York International Auto Show 2010.
LPI Hybrid.
In 2009, Kia unveiled the mild hybrid Forte at the Seoul Motor Show for the South Korean market. Taking its underpinnings from the Hyundai Elantra LPI Hybrid, the car is powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is powered with a 1.6-litre LPG engine coupled with a electric motor and a lithium-polymer battery pack, making it the first production car to use lithium-polymer batteries.
Market variations.
Asia.
For the Chinese market, Kia has offered the "Forte Furuidi" since 2009. The Furuidi was unveiled at the Nanjing International Expo Centre, and is available with the 1.6- "Gamma" and 2.0-liter "Theta" engines. "Furuidi" means "luck" and "auspiciousness" in the Chinese language—and has a pronunciation similar to its English name "Forte".
In Malaysia, the Forte is assembled by the joint-venture company Naza-Kia and is called the "Naza Forte". It is offered with the 1.6-liter "Gamma" and 2.0-liter "Theta II" engine variants, with six-speed automatic transmissions.
Europe.
In Russia and Ukraine, the Cerato (Forte) is available as the Cee'd's notchback counterpart, with the coupe and saloon available together. The Forte is not available in other European countries, due to the relatively low popularity of small family sedans there. Despite the LPI Hybrid being launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the Forte is still not offered in European countries outside Russia and Ukraine.
North America.
In the United States, the 2010 LX and EX included a 2.0-liter "CVVT" engine and a standard five-speed manual transmission, with an optional four-speed automatic or a five-speed automatic with the "Fuel Economy Package". For the 2011 model year, Forte is available with an optional six-speed automatic, with the four- and five-speed automatics being discontinued.
The LX is the base model. It comes standard with electronic stability control (ESC), and seat- and side-mounted airbags. The standard stereo includes four speakers, AM/FM radio, CD/MP3 player, and Sirius XM Radio. An iPod-compatible USB input jack and an auxiliary port for an external music device and steering wheel mounted audio controls are also integrated with the sound system. Bluetooth handsfree technology is also standard. The second-tier EX adds air conditioning, power windows and door locks, cruise control, a six-speaker radio, a key fob with keyless entry, and turn signal indicators on the side mirrors. The SX has the 2.4-liter engine with a six-speed manual or optional five-speed automatic transmission. The SX also adds alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever, a tilting and telescoping steering column, sport-cloth seats, and a metallic finish to the interior. Later production models have soft-touch panels on the armrest and door, as well as on the dashboard. For 2011, the EX and SX sedans are automatic-only, while the base sedan and all models of the Koup and Forte5 continue to offer the choice of manual or automatic.
An optional "Fuel Economy Package" adds low resistance silica tires, a more efficient alternator, a five-speed automatic transmission, and aerodynamic enhancements to increase fuel efficiency. With the "Fuel Economy Package", the Forte EX has a fuel consumption in city driving and in highway according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Automatic transmission models include an "Eco" display on the instrument panel that tells the driver when better than expected fuel efficiency is reached, hoping to influence driving habits toward more efficient operation.
For the Forte Koup, an optional leather package is available on both EX and SX trims. When combined with the EX trim, leather is utilized for the upholstery, steering wheel and shift lever; heated front seats and a sunroof are also included with the package. When paired with the SX trim, it includes only heated leather seats and the sunroof, as a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever are already fitted as standard.
The Forte sold in Canada has similar specifications and equipment as the US-market model. Some differences include the addition of power windows, door locks and power heated exterior mirrors on the base LX trim, a telescopic steering wheel on the EX trim, and a standard sunroof and automatic climate control system on the SX trim. The EX and SX also have a chrome-trimmed rear garnish and door handles. In contrast to the transmissions offered in the United States, the automatic transmission on offer in Canada is a 6-speed.
Second generation (2014–).
Kia released images of the second generation Forte for the 2014 model year in late July 2012, when the company revealed its Korean-market counterpart, Kia K3. The car is completely redesigned with a lower, wider, and longer stance. The 2014 Kia Forte is believed to include LED headlights and tail lights as a standard feature, and will further Kia's driver-oriented cockpit design inside. To make it more fuel efficient, the Forte is offered with the new "Nu" engine, in a 1.8 Liter DOHC MPI 4-cylinder producing with of torque, and a 2.0 Liter DOHC GDI 4-cylinder rated at with of torque.
The car was presented to the public for the first time out of South Korea on Santiago Motorshow (Chile) as Kia Cerato, on October 3, 2012.
In a small overlap frontal crash test carried out by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the Kia Forte scored the lowest in the group. The test simulates the front corner of the vehicle hits a tree, utility pole, or even another vehicle at 40-mph. According to the IIHS, this situation accounts for about a quarter of the serious injuries sustained in frontal crashes.
Motorsport.
Kia Racing, a factory-sponsored team in the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge, has currently entered a few Fortes in the series. Kia has proven to be notably competitive in the series as well as the SCCA World Challenge touring car class alongside the factory-sponsored Kia Rio in the Touring Car B-Spec class.

Assault and Peppered

Assault and Peppered is a Merrie Melodies cartoon featuring Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales and other mice.
Released on April 24, 1965, it was directed by Robert McKimson and produced by the award winning DePatie-Freleng, the production house responsible for the Pink Panther and other series of cartoons released by MGM.
Mel Blanc voiced Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and the mice.
Its run time is six minutes, the standard length of a Warner Brothers cartoon since pre-48 days.
The title of this cartoon is a play on the term "salt and pepper".
Synopsis.
This cartoon is a semi-remake of Friz Freleng's Bunker Hill Bunny. A group of starving mice are admiring Daffy Duck's Mexican plantation (aptly named El Rancho Rio Daffy), all the while wishing to have some of his home grown food. Evil land baron, Daffy, who isn't particularly fond of beggars, suddenly appears and angrily whips the mice for "starving on his property." Unfortunately, Speedy Gonzales interrupts and startles Daffy, at which the little black duck declares war on the mouse. The two proceed to do battle in private forts, resorting to everything from cannon fire to mine fields. At the end, Speedy (exhausted from doing battle with Daffy) quits and goes home. Daffy then declares victory and rewards himself with a 21 gun salute. Unfortunately, as he pulls the strings to fire his cannons, the cannons flip in his direction ("Mother!") and blast him one-by-one (with Speedy observantly keeping count).

New South Wales X200 class locomotive

The X200 class were a class of rail tractors introduced in 1963 and operated by the New South Wales Government Railways of Australia. They were a development of the smaller and less numerous X100 class. The X200 class remained in service until 1990 when they were either withdrawn or sold off to private companies, and some remain operational today.
Mark 1 series.
The Mark 1 series of the X200 class were 3 times more powerful and twice as heavy as the X100 class. Six examples were built and numbered X201-X206. 
They were built using a number of steam locomotive spare parts. They were built on the inner bogies of the AD60 Beyer-Garratt class locomotives, and used spare C36 class locomotive windows in their cabs. Their engines were rated at at 2,100 rpm and had a top speed of 24 mph. The rounded shapes of the hoods and cab gave it a baby-brother appearance to the main line 42 and 44 classes. The addition of a train brake allowed them to be run on the main line and also to be used as replacements for various ageing shunting locomotives. X201 was the first of the class entering service in December 1963. The six Mark 1s were initially used in the Sydney metropolitan network, but did later find their ways beyond this region.
Mark 2 series.
The Mark 2 series of the X200 class were different again. Twelve examples were built and numbered X207-X218. 
They were built on the outer bogies of the AD60 Beyer-Garratt class locomotives. Their engines were more powerful rated at at 2,100 rpm and they had a higher top speed of 32 mph. This made them more practical for light line use. One was even rostered on to the Yass Tramway, previously the domain of the Z13 class tank locomotives. The Z13 class were called back to Yass during winter months to provide heating to the train. The exterior design of the Mark 2 was squarer, giving it the appearance of a baby-brother to the 49 class diesel locomotives.
The first six were built in 1967. The second six being an additional order, were placed into traffic from May 1968, with the final member of the class entering service in December 1968. Despite differences in engine horsepower ratings, both variants were rated as having a tractive effort of . This was more powerful than many of the typical small and workshop steam shunting locomotives of the time.
Summary.
The X200 class must be considered largely successful, as they began to replace the various ageing steam shunting locomotives in various depots of the time. They were cleaner, more efficient to run, requiring less maintenance, and also giving locomotive crews more comfortable working conditions. Another indicator of the class' success is that several examples are still operational even today, at an age of around 45 years! Unfortunately, with the volatile and ever-changing nature of rail transport companies in the modern day, it is hard to keep a 100% accurate listing of their current owners and operational areas.
There is a certain amount of confusion with the numbering in this class. The numbers specified above apply to the class when first issued to traffic. In later years a certain amount of number-swapping was carried out by workshops. The biggest confusion being X101 and X212 swapping numbers, being two completely different types of locomotive! X217 and X218 later became X117 and X118, confusing the matter further. It appears that members of the X200 class were indiscriminately re-numbered into the X100 series. Many other renumberings exist. For the purposes of research it is often easier to refer to individual locomotives by their numbers when first issued to traffic and to note any number changes in brackets as below.

Custodian of the Holy Land

The Custodian of the Holy Land (also called the International Custodian of the Holy Land) is an officer of the Franciscan order, appointed by the General Definitorium of the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor, with the approval of the Pope and the Holy See. The Custodian, or Custos, is the head of all Franciscans in the Holy Land. The office is part of the Order of Friars Minor, and works closely with the Order in the Holy Land.
On 15 May 2004, Pierbattista Pizzaballa was appointed Custodian of the Holy Land, succeeding Giovanni Battistelli, who held the office for six years. On Friday, June 28, 2013, Pope Francis confirmed that he would continue as Custodian for at least a further three years. 
Pierbattista Pizzaballa was born at Cologno al Serio on 21 April 1965. He was ordained a priest in September 1990.
Today, the jurisdiction of the Custodian covers Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and the islands of Cyprus and Rhodes. The Custody has about 300 friars and about 100 sisters in these countries. The Franciscans serve the principal Christian shrines, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the Basilica of the Annunciation at Nazareth.
The custodian's offices are at the St. Savior's monastery, a 16th-century Franciscan monastery near New Gate.
The Franciscan order owns a great deal of property in the Holy Land, second only to the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. In addition to the major shrines of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem (which the Franciscans own and administer in common with the Jerusalem Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox patriarchates), the Custodian also cares for 74 shrines and sanctuaries throughout the Holy Land, including properties in Syria and Jordan. In 1909, in the territory of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, re-instituted in 1847, the Franciscans had 24 convents, and 15 parishes, including numerous schools.
History.
The Franciscan presence in the Holy Land started in 1217, when the province of Syria was established, with Brother Elias as Minister. By 1229, the friars had a small house near the fifth station of the Via Dolorosa. In 1272 the sultan Baibars allowed the Franciscans to settle in the Cenacle (also called the Upper Room) on Mount Sion. Later on, in 1309, they also settled in the Holy Sepulchre and in Bethlehem. 
In 1333, King Robert d'Angiò of Naples, and his wife, Sancia di Maiorca, bought the Cenacle from the Sultan of Egypt and gave it to the Franciscans. In 1342, Pope Clement VI, by the Papal bulls "Gratiam agimus" and "Nuper charissimae" declared the Franciscans as the official custodians of the Holy Places in the name of the Catholic Church. A portion reads:
A short time ago good news from the king and queen reached our Apostolic See relating that, at great cost and following difficult negotiations, they had obtained a concession from the Sultan of Babylon (that is, Cairo), who to the intense shame of Christians occupies the Holy Sepulchre of the Lord and the other Holy Places beyond the sea that were sanctified by the blood of this same Redeemer, to wit that friars of your Order may reside continuously in the church known as the Sepulchre and celebrate there Solemn Sung Masses and the Divine Office in the manner of the several friars of this Order who are already present in this place; moreover, this same Sultan has also conceded to the King and Queen the Cenacle of the Lord, the chapel where the Holy Spirit was manifested to the Apostles and the other chapel in which Christ appeared to the Apostles after his resurrection, in the presence of Blessed Thomas; and also the news of how the Queen built a convent on Mount Zion where, as is known, the Cenacle and the said chapels are located; where for some time she has had the intention of supporting twelve friars of your Order to assure the divine Liturgy in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, along with three laymen charged with serving the friars and seeing to their needs.
The Custodian was described as the “Guardian of Mount Zion in Jerusalem". Between 1342 and 1489, the Custodian was the head of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and held the "ex officio" title of Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. From 1374, he was based at the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura in Rome.
In 1489, Pope Innocent VIII suppressed the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and ruled that it was to be merged with the Knights Hospitaller. In 1496, Pope Alexander VI, restored the Order of Holy Sepulchre to independent status, but the Custodian ceased to be the head of the Order. Instead, a Grand Master of the Order was created, and the office vested in the papacy. The Custodian continued to act as the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem "ex officio" until 1830, and by being appointed to both offices until 1905. The office of Grand Master remained vested in the papacy until 1949. On 29 August 2011, Archbishop Edwin Frederick O'Brien was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI Grand Master to succeed Cardinal John Patrick Foley, who resigned the office on 24 February 2011 due to ill health. The Order is a member of many international bodies and has observer status at others (such as the United Nations). The Grand Master is a papal viceroy who assists Vatican diplomacy with procedural support for making motions, proposing amendments and requiring votes in the sphere of international diplomacy. 
Franciscan friars cared for the Cenacle, restoring also the building with Gothic vaults, until 1552 when the Turks captured Jerusalem and banished all Christians. After the Franciscan friars' eviction, the Cenacle was transformed into a mosque. Christians were not allowed to use the room for prayer until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
In 1623, the Latin Province of the Holy Land was split into a number of smaller entities, called Custodies - creating Custodies of Cyprus, Syria, and the Holy Land proper. The Custody of the Holy Land included the monasteries of Saint-Jean-d'Acre, Antioch, Sidon, Tyre, Jerusalem and Jaffa.
In 1847, a resident Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem was restored in the Holy Land, together with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem became the ecclesiastical superior of the Order, and eventually assumed the title Grand Prior, supplanting the Custodian. The office of Grand Master still remained vested in the papacy. 
In 1937, Alberto Gori was appointed Custodian of the Holy Land, an office he would occupy until 1949, when he was appointed Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, an office he held until 1970. In Gori's reports to the Vatican in the 1940s, he was critical of Jewish and later Israeli forces, whom he accused of destruction of holy places. Despite repeated Israeli assurances that Israel will guarantee freedom of religion and safeguard the Holy Places of all religions, Pius XII issued several encyclicals expressing concerns about the holy places as well as access.
In 1949, at the time of appointing Gori to the office of Latin Patriarch, Pope Pius XII also relinquished the title of Grand Master.
An online history, The Franciscan Presence in the Holy Land, has been prepared by the current Custodian, Fr. Pierbattista Pizzaballa, OFM.
Current issues.
Pierbattista Pizzaballa has expressed the view that there is a problem of the survival of the Christians in the Holy Land, with many Christians leaving the region, especially the Palestinian Territories, and that assistance with housing was aimed at avoiding emigration.
He has also stated that there is a serious problem in the reduction of a trained Christian presence "because whoever has the economic possibility and good training emigrates, since he does not see any prospect for the future. The problem exists in the Palestinian Territories and is due especially to the political situation in the territories and to the absence of economic prospects."
On Thursday, August 25, 2011, the Catholic News Service (CNS) website published a story where Father Pizzaballa, in a talk, during the course of a meeting, with Vatican Radio, alluded to the tense situation for Christians in Syria and Egypt.
Education.
An important role is education. Many schools are founded by the franciscan friars during the centuries.

Christianity in Kerala

Christianity is the third-most practiced religion in Kerala with 20% of the population according to the Indian census. Although a minority, Christians represent a much larger percentage of the population of Kerala than of India considered as a whole. It's a significant minority within Christianity in India. Christianity is believed to have reached the shores of Kerala in 52 A.D. with the arrival of St Thomas, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasrani) include Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Malankara Orthodox, Jacobite, Marthoma and Church of South India. Latin Rite Comprises the St Thomas Christians who adopted Latin rite in early 13th century, Latin Syrians or Eyunootikar and the Christians who were converted by the Portuguese in the 16th and 19th centuries mainly along the coastal areas of Kerala.
History.
The origins of Christianity in Kerala go back to the earliest period of the Church itself. In fact, there is a tradition among the Christian people of Kerala that St. Thomas the Apostle, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus, landed on the Kerala coast in 52 A.D. and preached the Gospel. He organized Christian communities, in several places and established seven churches in Kerala and then at last got martyrdom in Mylapore, Chennai, in 72 A.D. However the exact year of his arrival here is disputed due to lack of credible historical evidence. In 345 A.D., a Palestinian business man, Thomas Cana, along with 72 families came and settled in Kerala, thereby augmenting the Christian community. A second period of intense Latin Christian missionary activity began with the arrival of European missionaries since the discovery of sea route to India by Vasco da Gama in 1498.
In 1841 Benjamin Bailey translated the first of many Bible translations into Malayalam.

Marylebone Cricket Club cricket team in Bangladesh in 1980–81

The tour started immediately after Christmas and ended in mid-January. Michael Mence, a member of the 1976-77 MCC team, was the captain of the side, which included three former Test players, John Jameson, John Hampshire, and Richard Hutton.
Scores in brief.
In the first match, Central Zone just managed to avoid defeat. The fearsome bowling of the tall fast bowler Wilson created havoc in the local camp.
At Faridpur, in the first innings the MCC batting collapsed badly against the medium pace of Obaidul Haq Azam. His 7/18 was the best bowlng by a Bangladeshi bowler at the time, breaking Syed Ashraful's record of 7/23 in the 1979 ICC Trophy against Fiji. Also, this match marked the international debut for Gazi Ashraf Lipu. He went to play a significant role in the development of Bangladesh cricket. 
The Chittagong match was abandoned early on the 2nd day due to bad weather.
The infamous weather of Chittagong intervened to spoil the match. Raquibul Hasan was specially unlucky, as he looked set for his first hundred in Bangladeshi colors. 
The drawn match at Rajshahi was dominated by the spinners of both the sides. The slow turning pitch made strokeplay extremely difficult. The Bangladeshi top order batting collapsed against the spin of Dermott Monteith on the 1st day. But the lower order, led by captain Hira and ever reliable Jahangir Shah fought back. Off spinner, Anwarul Amin Azhar showed class during the MCC innings. Only the veteran, Jameson, on his 2nd tour of Bangladesh could handle him properly. Azhar is widely regarded as the best Bangladeshi spinner of the decade. The Bangladesh batting collapsed again in the 2nd innings, but young Mujibul Haq stood firm to save the match.
Raquibul Hasan scored half centuries in each innings at Dhaka. He got good support from the opener Yousuf Babu in the 2nd innings. But the match belonged to Mark Nicholas. Batting at number three, the Hampshire batsman amassed the first century by an MCC player against Bangladesh.
The only match to produce a result was the one-day match where the inexperience of the local players in the shorter version of the game was exposed.
These matches saw the emergence of a number of talented youngsters in Bangladesh cricket, like Gazi Ashraf Lipu, Rafiqul Alam, Mujibul Haq, Nehal Hasnain, Obiadul Haq Azam, Nadir Shah, and Manjur Ahmed Manju. While some of them failed to live up to the expectations, Lipu, Rafiq & Nehal went on to play vital role in Bangladesh cricket throughout the 80s.

Patri Friedman

Patri Friedman (born July 29, 1976 in Blacksburg, Virginia) is an American activist and theorist of political economy.
Early life.
Friedman grew up in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and is a graduate of Upper Merion Area High School, class of 1994, where he went by the name Patri Forwalter-Friedman. He was named after Patri J. Pugliese, a close friend of his parents. He graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 1998, and worked as a software engineer at Google. As a poker player, he cashed in the World Series of Poker four times.
The Seasteading Institute.
Friedman was executive director of the Seasteading Institute, founded on April 15, 2008, with a half-million-dollar donation by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. The Institute's mission is "to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems". This was initially a part-time project — one day a week while working as a Google engineer the rest of the time — but Friedman left Google on July 29, 2008 to spend more time on seasteading. He and partner Wayne Gramlich hoped to float the first prototype seastead in the San Francisco Bay by 2010. At the October 2010 Seasteading social, it was announced that current plans were to launch a seastead by 2014.
Since attending the Burning Man festival in 2000, Friedman imagined creating a water festival called Ephemerisle as a Seasteading experiment and Temporary Autonomous Zone. Through the Seasteading Institute, Friedman was able to start the Ephemerisle festival in 2009, aided by TSI's James Hogan as event organizer and Chicken John Rinaldi as chief builder. The first Ephemerisle is chronicled in Jason Sussberg's documentary http://vimeo.com/11236146, and appeared on Google Maps satellite view for several years. Since 2010, the event has been annual and community-run.
Future Cities Development.
On July 31, 2011, Friedman stepped down from the position of executive director at the Seasteading Institute, and remained chairman of the board. Later, he co-founded the Future Cities Development Corporation, a project to establish a self-governing charter city within the borders of Honduras.
Family.
Patri is the grandson of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and economist Rose Friedman and son of economist and physicist David D. Friedman. He is divorced and has two children.

Muhammad Faisal

Muhammad Faisal is an Iraqi refugee who was detained on the island of Nauru between 2001 and 2006 under the Australian Government's "pacific solution". Faisal became the second last Iraqi refugee to leave Nauru after he was initially refused a protection visa on the basis of an adverse security assessment issued by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).
Attempt to apply for asylum.
Faisal was one of 227, mostly Iraqi, refugees who boarded an Indonesian vessel, the Aceng, in August 2001. After a nine day journey, the Aceng approached the Ashmore Islands, an Australian territory where the refugees believed they could apply for asylum. The Aceng was intercepted by Royal Australian Navy vessels acting under Operation Relex, an Australian Government operation designed to prevent asylum seekers reaching the Australian migration zone by sea.
After attempts to force the Aceng to leave the Ashmore Islands contiguous zone were abandoned, the passengers of the Aceng were transferred to the warship HMAS "Manoora". "Manoora", which had a capacity for only 450 people, was already carrying approximately 400 mostly Afghan asylum seekers transferred from the MV Tampa, the Norwegian cargo ship at the centre of the diplomatic crisis which triggered the Australian Government's policy of off-shore detention.
"Manoora" sailed to a location in international waters off Darwin, where she was reprovisioned. The then Prime Minister, John Howard, told journalists: "At no stage did this latest vessel reach Australian territorial waters. As a result questions of application for asylum status do not arise."
Upon "Manoora"’s arrival in Nauru, many of the Iraqi asylum seekers refused to leave the vessel. After 12 days, they were removed from "Manoora" by force.
ASIO security assessments.
While Faisal's claim to asylum was recognised by the Australian Government, his resettlement was prevented after the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) assessed both he and another Iraqi refugee, Mohammed Sagar, to be "direct or indirect" threats to Australia's national security in 2005.
While in detention, Faisal suffered severe depression, leading to his evacuation to Brisbane in September 2006. A second security assessment conducted by ASIO found that Faisal was not a security threat and he was permitted to settle in Australia. Faisal has never been informed of the reasons for the initial adverse assessment.
Legal challenge.
Faisal and Sagar are suing the Director-General of Security, Paul O'Sullivan in the Federal Court in an effort to determine the reasons for ASIO's adverse assessments. In November 2007, the court ordered discovery of documents including Faisal and Sagar's adverse security assessments, but ASIO appealed to the Full Court.

RFTrax

RFTrax is a wholly owned subsidiary of IONX, an Amsted Rail Company, specializing in mobile asset management. The company is headquartered with its parent in Sugar Land, Texas near Houston. The company supplies telemetry asset tracking and protection technologies to the rail industry designing and manufacturing their products in Houston. Their Asset Management Platform or "AMP" provides owners and operators real time data regarding the location, speed, and direction of rail cars using GPS data communicated via the GSM cellular system. Optionally, accelerometer equipped units report high impact events protecting valuable and hazardous rail cargo. Special locomotive units report vital operating characteristics, in order to improve efficiency and safety.
In June 2008, RFTrax introduced the "GetiSight" GPS product line of vehicle tracking devices targeted to consumers and small commercial fleet operators.
History.
Based in the Seattle, WA area, RFTrax was founded in 2001 by Fred Barrett and Lynn Neff as a hardware/software technology company focused on supply chain visibility and high-value asset management and tracking. Barrett led the company’s technology initiatives, positioning the products for inclusion in US Department of Homeland Security’s “Operation Safe Commerce” container security initiatives, and other international supply chain pilots, while Neff led sales, marketing and partner alliances. Barrett and Neff co-developed and received a patent for “inter-modal telemetry and monitoring solution” which is now in use by major corporations (U.S. Patent #7135976). Included in the business plan were a series of low-cost, low-power sensors, including a gamma-ray sensor and an optical sensor for use in freight containers.
RFTrax was acquired in 2005 by Fairfield Industries, Sugar Land, TX. Fairfield is a privately owned geophysical company whose owners have interests in containerized shipping and so were interested in container security in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Fairfield named Hal Haygood, its engineering manager, as president of the newly acquired RFTrax, replacing Neff. With Fairfield's money, new sensor development projects and partnerships were initiated with Los Alamos National Laboratory and various universities for advanced chemical, biological, and radiological sensors. Barrett and Neff continued to lead product development and marketing efforts through the completion of their contracts in April, 2007. By that time, technological challenges and the soft market for homeland security products had led RFTrax to pursue the rail market. This move also freed up demands on capital investment since the rail market could be provided with commodity sensors requiring only engineering without significant research. The early advanced sensor projects and partnerships were mostly abandoned. 
During the latter part of 2008, Fairfield reorganized RFTrax. Roger Keyte was appointed as company president, replacing Hal Haygood who has since left the company. John Felty, who had come to RFTrax from Lat-Lon LLC of Sheridan, Colorado in autumn, 2005, was promoted to Vice President. Felty had led the transition of RFTrax from the homeland security to the rail asset monitoring market. The company continues to supply tracking and monitoring devices for locomotives, railcars, fleets, and consumer vehicles. Its principle competitors are Lat-Lon and Skybitz. Lat-Lon and RFTrax are both privately held.
RFTrax was acquired in May 2009 by IONX, an Amsted Rail Company. IONX is located in West Chester, PA, and Amsted Rail's corporate headquarters are in Chicago, IL.

<doc id="18265586" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18265586" title="Bank of Indiana">
Bank of Indiana

The state Bank of Indiana was a government chartered banking institution established in 1833 in response to the state's shortage of capital caused by the closure of the Second Bank of the United States by the administration of President Andrew Jackson. The bank operated for twenty-six years and allowed the state to finance its internal improvements, stabilized the state's currency problems, and encouraged greater private economic growth. The bank closed in 1859. The profits were then split between the shareholders, allowing depositors to exchange their bank notes for federal notes, and the bank's buildings and infrastructure were sold and reincorporated as the privately owned Second Bank of Indiana.
Background.
The Indiana Territorial legislature had charted two banks in 1813. With no other established banks operating in Indiana, they were the first attempt by the government to bring banking and a standard currency to the young territory. The banks were granted twenty-year charters, but they quickly fell into financial difficulties following the Panic of 1819. By 1823 both banks had folded. Without any banks in the state, the government and the citizens came to rely on the use of notes issued from the Second Bank of the United States.
In 1832 President Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill to extend the charter of the Second Bank of the United States and removed federal deposits, forcing it to cease most operations by 1833 due to a lack of reserve cash. The result caused a shortage of hard money (coin) at a critical time in Indiana's development. The state had just begun a large series of internal improvements and was funding the projects with millions of dollars of loans. The sudden hard money shortage required the use of paper money to pay maintenance on the state's debt, but with the closure of the national bank there was no means by which the state could easily obtain paper money.
The looming crisis became a major political issue in the state's 1833 election campaign. That year a Whig majority was elected to the Indiana General Assembly. They responded to the problem by passing legislation to establish the Bank of Indiana with the intention that the bank would be able to issue paper money and help to finance the state's debt. The bill was drafted by Samuel Hannah and was enacted into law on January 28, 1834.
Formation of the bank.
On February 13 the seven member board of directors met to begin organizing the bank. The board of directors included James Lanier, who would personally benefit from the bank the greatest. They elected James M. Ray as cashier. The state created a charter for the new bank similar to the one used by the national bank. There were some modifications to make the bank better fit the needs of Indiana including limiting the bank to thirteen branches, and promising to allow no other bank to be established in the state. The directors choose to establish branches in Indianapolis, Lawrenceburg, Richmond, Madison, New Albany, Vincennes, Bedford, Terre Haute, and Lafayette. A Fort Wayne branch was added in 1835 and branches in South Bend and Michigan City in 1836.
Each branch had an initial investment of $160,000, at first there were only ten branches and the total bank's value was $1.6 million. The start up money was all hard money in Spanish and Mexican silver dollars. The money was raised by issuing stock sold at $50 per share. Half of the stock was to be purchased by the state and the other half was sold to the public. By May 20, 1834, all the public stock for the new bank had been issued. The state allowed the public stock to be sold at $18.75 per share, with the other $31.25 being financed on the state's credit, until the purchaser could pay the full amount back to the state with 6% interest. On August 6, the state completed its purchase of 50% of the bank's stock. The money to purchase the stock came through the sale and mortgage of thousands of acres of public land. On November 19 Governor Noah Noble declared the bank open for business.
Hugh McCulloch, who served under four presidents as United States Secretary of the Treasury, begin his career in banking at the Bank of Indiana. He was one of the few prominent businessmen in the young state, but had no experience in banking. He was chosen as president of the bank by the directors because he was "better fitted for the place than anybody else whose services they could obtain", he was the best they could get. Indiana was still a virtual wilderness inhabited by roving bands of American Indians and not at all appealing to the professional bankers of the east.
In its initial report to the shareholders, the bank reported that it held deposits of $127,236, had $456,065 of paper cash in circulation, $751,083 of cash on hand, and another $78,150 invested in other banks. This showed the bank to be in excellent financial health and to have a promising future.
Operation.
The bank charter had various clauses to help prevent possible insolvency and reduce risks. Bank officers were not permitted to receive loans at a rate different from that offered to the public. The bank could not issue securities on its own stock, and any loan over $500 had to be approved by five-sevenths of banks board members. Any losses were to be paid by the individual shareholders up to an amount equal to their stock value. At it highest point, in 1851, the bank had $4 million of bank notes in circulation and $2 million in specie reserves The bank was an early success. Many who had purchased the stock on credit found that the dividends paid out exceeded the interest they were charged, and by the time the bank's charter expired almost all of the public stock had been paid for with investors receiving as much a 650% return on investment when the bank closed.
The state used the bank to continue financing its internal improvements. They issued bank bonds that were sold on the London exchange. The state miscalculated on the amount of credit they could afford, and by 1841 the state was on the edge of bankruptcy having borrowed more than $10 million, an equivalent to the state's previous fifteen years of tax revenue. In response to the bankruptcy crisis the state sent James Lanier to London to negotiate with the bondholders. The negotiations led the state to liquidate all of its public works, except the Wabash and Erie Canal, turning them over to the creditors in exchange for the bonds being reduced 50% in value. The result was a large negative impact to the state's credit, but the cut in the bond value allowed the state to payoff the debt before the bank charter expired.
The profits the state made from the bank were large, by owning 50% of the bank, and then devaluing the state debts by 50%, the bank was able to turn a high profit. The state received at least a 500% return on investment, but the profit was less than half the amount lost on the internal improvements, most of which were never completed or quickly fell into disrepair and became unusable. The state's profits were small in comparison to the enterprise spurred by the bank. With the ready available of capitol at low rates of interest, small business sprung up across the state finally transformed Indiana's mostly barter system into a cash system of trade.
With the state's credit ruined, the onset of the Mexican American War found Indiana in a poor condition to finance the regiments it needed to send in support of the war effort. With no other creditor willing to lend the state money, each of the branches was asked to furnish a loan of $10,000 for the effort and all came through with the money for the request.
The bank was one of the most stable in the country and its banknotes were accepted throughout the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest. It only suspended exchange of paper money for hard money once in 1837, when all the other banks in the nation did the same. The bank's coinage was almost exclusively silver, but it did contain a small amount of gold. It increased its gold holding significantly after the 1848 California Gold Rush led to more availability of gold, but silver remained the primary coin in circulation.
At the time of the 1837 suspension, the bank had over $1.5 million in federal deposits. Because of the nationwide suspension the federal government was desperately short of hard money. Lanier personally delivered $80,000 in hard money to Levi Woodbury, the Secretary of the Treasury, knowing their situation. Because the bank was the only one in the nation that voluntarily gave hard money to the treasury, the treasury increased their deposit amount in the bank, further adding to its stability.
The bank was able to maintain its large reserves of hard money because many of the farmers in the state made their initial deposits in coin. There having been no prior bank in the region to issue paper money, hard money was the most widely used currency. The bank came under criticism in the 1840s. The "Free Bankers" considered the state bank a monopoly, which it was, and thought it was not liberal enough in offering loans. They claimed the bank was more likely to loan money to a farmer with assets than to private enterprises. The Free Bankers were dominant at the 1851 Constitutional Convention and instituted clauses that would end the state bank and authorize other banks to being operating in Indiana, ending the bank's monopoly. Many of the competing banks lost solvency in the Panic of 1857, but the bank of Indiana remained strong and did not even require the suspension of specie payment.
The bank lobbied to have its charter extended, but the Democrats and Free Bankers who controlled the General Assembly refused. The bank charter expired in January 1857, but the bank was permitted to continue operating until 1859 to help exchange the bank's currency for notes from the new national bank. Governor Joseph A. Wright was bitterly opposed to the bank and the extension of its charter. Before the bill was passed he went to the House of Representatives to personally deliver a speech indicting the bank for "corruption and fraud", and alluded that the bank bribed members of the assembly to have its charter extended. Despite his speech and veto of the bill, the General Assembly passed the act with a super-majority.
Aftermath.
The closure of the bank did not have any significant impact on the regional economy. The state bank notes were exchanged for federal bank notes or hard money, and the surplus of funds was paid out to the bank shareholders. In 1851 General John Coburn, a delegate at the constitutional convention, proposed that any profit the state made from the bank be applied to the state's common school system. At the time most delegate believed the bank would end with a debt and thought the suggestion was fanciful, but the clause was added to constitution. The state's share of the profit, which was more than $3.5 million, was put into an education fund which helped the state continue to maintain the first state funded school system in the nation.
Many of the bank's notes were still not redeemed when the bank closed. To remedy this problem, and to maintain their reputation, the bank made arrangements with the national bank to deposit an amount equal to the outstanding notes that could be redeemed at the national bank out of that account, even if the Bank of Indiana ceased to operate. The bank is one of the few in history up to that time that was still solvent when it closed and actually paid out a profit to its investors. 
The state passed legislation late in 1859 to permit the bank to incorporate privately. By then its stock had mostly been paid out, but it still retained its branch buildings and infrastructure which was reincorporated as the Second Bank of Indiana, a private institution with McCulloch continuing as president. James Lanier became so wealthy from his investments that when the state verged on bankruptcy during the American Civil War that he was able to privately bankroll the state and pay maintenance on their debt. He would use his wealth to become the largest shareholder in the Second Bank of Indiana, which during the Civil War financed the cost of calling up and equipping the state's regiments. The second bank continued until 1865 when, in an attempt to reestablish the primacy of the national bank, a 10% tax was created on bank notes that crippled the bank's profitability, forcing it to close.

Breamore Priory

Breamore Priory was a priory of Austin canons in Breamore, Hampshire, England.
Foundation.
The priory was founded some time towards the end of the reign of Henry I by Baldwin de Redvers and his uncle Hugh de Redvers.
Dissolution.
The last prior, Prior Finch, wrote at least twice to Thomas Cromwell proffering his service and that of his house, and desiring Cromwell's favour. But according to the "Valor Ecclesiasticus" of 1535 the annual value of the priory was £200 5s. 1½d., together with two pounds of pepper. Less alms and other obligatory outgoings of £45 11s. the annual value was only £154 14s. 1½d. and the pepper. This brought the house well below the limit for the first series of dissolutions, and it was surrendered on 10 July 1536.
Post-Dissolution.
The site of the priory and all its possessions was granted in November 1536 to Henry, Marquis of Exeter, and his wife Gertrude. A large manor house, Breamore House, was built on the site in 1583.
Present day.
No visible remains of the priory survive.

SWIFT message types

SWIFT or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication provides a network to allow financial and non-financial institutions (e.g. corporates) to transfer financial transactions through a 'financial message'.
Currently SWIFT's network can support the following message standards:
SWIFT MT.
SWIFT messages, developed by SWIFT Standards Laboratories Private Limited, consist of five blocks of data including three headers, message content, and a trailer. Message types are crucial to identifying content. 
All SWIFT messages include the literal "MT" (Message Type). This is followed by a 3-digit number that denotes the message category, group and type. Consider the following example, which is an order to buy or sell via a third party: 
The first digit (3) represents the category. A category denotes messages that relate to particular financial instruments or services such as Precious Metals (6), Treasury (3), or Travelers Cheques (8). The category denoted by 3 is Treasury Markets. 
The second digit (0) represents a group of related parts in a transaction life cycle. The group indicated by 0 is a Financial Institution Transfer. 
The third digit (4) is the type that denotes the specific message. There are several hundred message types across the categories. The type represented by 4 is a notification.
Overview of SWIFT MT Categories:
ISO 15022 MT.
Although ISO 15022 Message Types are different in their structure than the SWIFT MT, the naming convention remains the same. The following example will illustrate:
As with SWIFT MTs, the first digit (3) denotes the category. As above, this denotes Treasury Markets.
As with SWIFT MTs, the second digit (0) represents a group of related parts in a transaction life cycle. The group indicated by 0 is a Financial Institution Transfer. 
Finally, the third digit (7) denotes the specific message. In this case, similar to the MT 304, the 7 denotes ‘Notification’. The SWIFT MT 304 and the ISO 15022 MT 307 are equal but were created for different financial groups using different standards.
ISO 20022 MX.
A new message type expressed in XML syntax, which is more flexible and easier to implement than the previous generation of message types (MT). These message types are developed in accordance with ISO 20022 standard.
Current syntax is as following: xxxx.nnn.aaa.bb, where
Consider the following example: TREA.001.001.02

Swift and Company v. United States

Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375 (1905), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Commerce Clause allowed the government to regulate monopolies if it has a direct effect on commerce. It marked the success of the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt in destroying the "Beef Trust." This case established a "stream of commerce" (or "current of commerce") argument that allows Congress to regulate things that fall into either category. In particular it let Congress to regulate the Chicago slaughterhouse industry. Even though the slaughterhouse supposedly only dealt with intrastate matters, the butchering of meat was merely a "station" along the way between cow and meat. Thus as it was part of the greater meat industry that was between the several states Congress can regulate it. The Court's decision halted price fixing by Swift & Company and its allies.
The case originated in 1902 when President Theodore Roosevelt directed his Attorney General Philander Knox to bring a lawsuit against the "Beef Trust" on antitrust grounds using the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The evidence at trial demonstrated that the "Big Six" leading meatpackers were engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market for livestock and meat in their quest for higher prices and higher profits. They blacklisted competitors who failed to go along, used false bids, and accepted rebates from the railroads. The six companies involved were Swift, Armour, Morris, Cudahy, Wilson and Schwartzchild. Together they did $700 million a year in business and controlled half of the national market, and up to 75% in New York City. When they were hit with federal injunctions in 1902, the Big Six agreed to merge into one National Packing Company in 1903, so they could continue to control the trade internally. The case was heard by the Supreme Court in 1905, shortly after it struck down a similar consolidation and the Northern Securities case of 1904. Speaking for the court, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. broadened the meaning of "interstate" commerce by including actions that were part of the chain where the chain was clearly interstate in character. In this case, the chain ran from farm to retail store and crossed many state lines. The government's victory in the case encouraged it to pursue other antitrust actions. Public opinion, which had been outraged by Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle" that depicted horribly unsanitary conditions in Chicago's meatpacking plants, supported the decision. Congress followed by passing in 1906 both the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act.

Imperial Library of Constantinople

The Imperial Library of Constantinople, in the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, was the last of the great libraries of the ancient world. Long after the destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria and the other ancient libraries, it preserved the knowledge of the ancient Greeks and Romans for almost 1,000 years. A series of unintentional fires over the years and wartime damage, including the raids of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, impacted the building itself and its contents. The library continued in substantial form until the city of Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 when the library's considerable surviving contents were destroyed or lost. The library was founded by Constantius II (reigned 337-361 AD) who established a Scriptorium so that the surviving works of Greek literature could be copied and so preserved. The Emperor Valens in 372 employed four Greek and three Latin calligraphers. The majority of Greek classics known today are known through Byzantine copies originating from the Imperial Library of Constantinople.
History.
In ancient Greece the written word and most literature was transcribed onto papyrus. As the papyrus began to deteriorate there was a movement to transfer the reading material from papyrus to parchment as did Constantine the Great, around the 4th century, but his movement specifically concerned Holy Scripture. Constantine's heir to the throne Constantius II continued this movement. It was his work that culminated in the first Imperial Library of Constantinople. The library is estimated to have contained some 100,000 volumes of ancient text. The movement was headed by one Themistios, who commanded a group of calligraphers and librarians.
Agathon.
Agathon the Reader, was at first Reader, then Librarian, at Constantinople: in 680 AD, during his Readership, he was Notary or Reporter at the Sixth General Council, which condemned the Monothelite heresy. He sent copies of the acts, written by himself, to the five Patriarchates. In 712 AD he wrote a short treatise, still extant in Greek, on the attempts of Philippicus Bardanes to revive Monothelitism.
Contents of the library.
Those working on the transfer of the ancient papyrus texts to parchment dedicated a great deal of time and attention to prioritizing what warranted being preserved. Older works like Homer and the Hellenistic history were given priority over Latin works. 
Also not prioritized were older works that were no longer spoken like the works of the Attic period. Works like Sophocles and other authors, whose works focused on grammar and text were chosen over least used or contemporary works. Due to this form of selective preservation, many works, which were known to Themistios and that he mentions like the triad of Stoic philosophers are now lost. Some fragments of these lost works have been found at Herculaneum.
For papyrus texts that were not translatable, the group attempted to preserve them from decay by encasing them in parchment.
The destruction of the library.
Over the centuries, several fires in the Library of Constantinople destroyed much of the collection. The library was burnt in the year 473 and about 120,000 volumes were lost. However, the attempts of Themistios and Constantius were not fruitless, as some works were saved and recopied and circulated through other texts. Consequently, modern knowledge of Classical Greek literature is greater than would be the case if not for their efforts. 
In 1204, the library was destroyed by the Normans of the Fourth Crusade.
Whilst there were many reports of surviving texts into the Ottoman era, no substantive portion of the library's has ever been recovered. Professor Carlyle was provided access in 1800 to the Seraglio, the supposed repository of post-Ottoman conquest surviving texts, but no texts from the Imperial Library were located. A notable exception is the Archimedes Palimpsest, that surfaced in 1840, was translated in 1915 and was unaccountably found in a private collection and sold in 1998.

Documentary collection

A documentary collection is a process, in which the seller instructs his bank to forward documents related to the export of goods to the buyer's bank with a request to present these documents to the buyer for payment, indicating when and on what conditions these documents can be released to the buyer.
The buyer may obtain possession of goods and clear them through customs, if the buyer has the shipping documents (original bill of lading, certificate of origin, etc.). The documents, however, are only released to the buyer after payment has been made ("Documents against Payment") or payment undertaking has been given - the buyer has accepted a bill of exchange issued by the seller and payable at a certain date in the future (maturity date) ("Documents against Acceptance").
Documentary Collections facilitate import/export operations. They do not provide the same level of security as Letters of Credit, but, as a result, the costs are lower. Unlike the Letters of Credit, for a Documentary Collection the bank acts as a channel for the documents but does not issue any payment covenants (does not guarantee payment). The bank that has received a documentary collection may debit the buyer's account and make payment only if authorised by the buyer.
Possibilities and advantages:
Make international trade operations more flexible,
Use Documentary Collection in cases when the seller does not want to deliver goods to the buyer on "open account" basis, but due to a long-term stable business relationship between the parties there is no need for security provided by a Letter of Credit or payment guarantee,
Documentary collection is suitable to the seller:
if the seller has no doubts about the buyer's ability to meet its payment obligations,
if the political and economical situation in the buyer's country is stable,
if there are no foreign exchange restrictions in the seller's country;
Documentary collection is convenient for the buyer because:
there is no need for an advance payment; payment for goods can be made when shipping documents have been received,
in cases of documents released against acceptance the buyer has the possibility to sell the goods first and afterwards make payment to the seller.
Documentary Collection assures the seller that the shipping documents will be released to the buyer only upon payment or acceptance of a Bill of Exchange.

Bull Pain

Frank Vizi, known by his ring names Bull Pain and Rick Gantner, is an American independent professional wrestler, currently best known for his work in IWA Mid-South, and for his past career as part of the Texas Hangmen tag team in promotions such as American Wrestling Association, United States Wrestling Association and World Wrestling Council.
Career.
Early career.
Vizi had a grounding in martial arts and boxing, but having been taken to AWA shows by his father became a fan of professional wrestling (particularly Superstar Billy Graham, The Crusher and The Valiant Brothers). He got his start in Milwaukee at Federation Hall training with Tom "Rocky" Stone, having his first independent match vs Lance Atlas as Ricky "Wildfire" Golden, before moving to Bob Geigel's NWA Heart of America and debuting against Gypsy Joe as Rick Gantner.
Vizi then moved on to work for Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association, debuting on TV against Bruiser Brody, and going on to wrestle the likes of Nick Bockwinkel, Scott Norton, Baron Von Raschke and Stan Hansen. After working as a jobber for the AWA (as well as regular appearances for the World Wrestling Federation, NWA and others), Vizi was repackaged as a masked wrestler named Psycho and paired up with Killer (Mike Moran) as the Texas Hangmen, a gimmick used primarily in Puerto Rico, particularly wrestling for the World Wrestling Council where they would become four time WWC World Tag Team Champions. After returning from Puerto Rico, the Texas Hangmen found that they were in demand in the United States, wrestling back in AWA, as well as going to wrestle in Memphis for the United States Wrestling Association.
World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling.
While wrestling for Global Wrestling Federation, Vizi developed the Bull Pain gimmick, using an old high school football nickname. At the same time Ian Rotten was in a feud with his kayfabe brother Axl Rotten in Extreme Championship Wrestling, during which Axl Rotten disappeared. As Ian and Bull Pain had previously worked together in USWA, he recommended Bull Pain as a replacement, and the two had a brief feud, including Taipei Death Matches and Barbed Wire Baseball Bat Matches. Bull Pain was also wrestling at this time as a regular "enhancement talent" for World Championship Wrestling, wrestling the likes of Jim Duggan, Hak, Van Hammer, Johnny B Badd, and Bobby Duncum, Jr.
Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South.
After being released from ECW, Bull Pain debuted for Ian Rotten's Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South, a company he still makes appearances for. Bull has stated that he considers the IWA:Mid-South to be "one of the best independent shows on the market", and that he feels that they are only held back by the area in which they are putting on shows. Pain went on to both hold the Television and Light Heavyweight Championships, as well as holding the Heavyweight Championship five times.
Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007-present).
Bull Pain debuted in Juggalo Championship Wrestling at "East Side Wars" by attacking hero 2 Tuff Tony. In the following weeks, Pain continued to beat opponents mercilessly using a metal baseball bat he called Brother Pain. At Bloodymania, 2 Tuff Tony defeated Bull Pain in a Louisville Slugger match. The following year at Bloodymania II, Pain replaced Isabella Smothers to team with Tracy Smothers in a losing effort against 2 Tuff Tony and Boondox. Pain continued his losing streak at Bloodymania III, losing a Tough Man Match to Butterbean. At Oddball Wrestling 2010, Bull Pain and Ian Bloody lost to Corporal Robinson and 2 Tuff Tony in a Taipei Deathmatch. The following night at Bloodymania IV, Pain and Bloody interfered in a match on Tracy Smothers' behalf. The duo was fended off by Jim Duggan and Smothers' opponent Booker T.
By the end of 2010, Pain was put into a storyline in which he was seemingly dating Tracy Smothers' daughter Isabella. Both Pain and Isabella became involved in a rivalry with The Weedman. On March 26, 2011, Pain took part in Juggalo Championship Wrestling's first internet pay-per-view Hatchet Attacks. Teaming with Baby Bitch Boy and The Bumpin' Uglies, Pain lost to the team of The Weedman, 2 Tuff Tony, Jailbird Man, and Rhino. At the following event, he lost to The Weedman in a match that seemingly ended their feud. At Bloodymania 2011, Bull teamed with Tracy Smothers in a losing effort against Necro Butcher and Mad Man Pondo, The Ring Rydas and Scott Levy and Slim Goody. Raven and Goody left with the Tag Team straps.
Chikara.
Following a run-in at Deuces Wild, Bull Pain made his Chikara in-ring debut at Passion and Persistence (April 20, 2008) at the New Alhambra Arena, teaming with Vin Gerard against The Colony (Fire Ant and Soldier Ant). Due to Pain's use of his signature baseball bat, which he nicknamed Brother Pain, Pain and Gerard were disqualified, and Leonard F. Chikarason (Chikara's Director of Fun) banned them both from appearing on any Chikara shows for 30 days. Pain has not been seen in the company since.

Collateral management

Collateral has been used for hundreds of years to provide security against the possibility of payment default by the opposing party in a trade. Collateral management began in the 1980s, with Bankers Trust and Salomon Brothers taking collateral against credit exposure. There were no legal standards, and most calculations were performed manually on spreadsheets. Collateralisation of derivatives exposures became widespread in the early 1990s. Standardisation began in 1994 via the first ISDA documentation.
In the modern banking industry collateral is mostly used in over the counter (OTC) trades.
However, collateral management has evolved rapidly in the last 15–20 years with increasing use of new technologies, competitive pressures in the institutional finance industry, and heightened counterparty risk from the wide use of derivatives, securitization of asset pools, and leverage. As a result, collateral management is now a very complex process with interrelated functions involving multiple parties.
The basics of collateral.
What is collateral and why is it used?
Borrowing funds often requires the designation of collateral on the part of the recipient of the loan.
Collateral is legally watertight, valuable liquid property that is pledged by the recipient as security on the value of the loan.
The main reason of taking collateral is credit risk reduction, especially during the time of the debt defaults, the currency crisis and the failure of major hedge funds. But there are many other motivations why parties take collateral from each other:
These motivations are interlinked, but the overwhelming driver for use of collateral is the desire to protect against credit risk. Many banks do not trade with counterparties without collateral agreements. This is typically the case with hedge funds.
Types of collateral.
There is a wide range of possible collaterals used to collateralise credit exposure with various degrees of risks. The following types of collaterals are used by parties involved:
The most predominant form of collateral is cash and government securities. According to ISDA, cash represents around 82% of collateral received and 83% of collateral delivered in 2009, which is broadly consistent with last year’s results. Government securities constitute fewer than 10% of collateral received and 14% of collateral delivered this year, again consistent with end-2008. The other types of collateral are used less frequently.
What Is Collateral Management?
The idea of collateral management.
The practice of putting up collateral in exchange for a loan has long been a part of the lending process between businesses. With more institutions seeking credit, as well as the introduction of newer forms of technology, the scope of collateral management has grown. Increased risks in the field of finance have inspired greater responsibility on the part of borrowers, and it is the aim of the collateral management to make sure the risks are as low as possible for the parties involved.
Collateral management is the method of granting, verifying, and giving advice on collateral transactions in order to reduce credit risk in unsecured financial transactions. The fundamental idea of collateral management is very simple, that is cash or securities are passed from one counterparty to another as security for a credit exposure. In a swap transaction between parties A and B, party A makes a mark-to-market (MtM) profit whilst party B makes a corresponding MtM loss. Party B then presents some form of collateral to party A to mitigate the credit exposure that arises due to positive MtM. The form of collateral is agreed before initiation of the contract. Collateral agreements are often bilateral. Collateral has to be returned or posted in the opposite direction when exposure decreases. In the case of a positive MtM, an institution calls for collateral and in the case of a negative MtM they have to post collateral.
Collateral management has many different functions. One of these functions is credit enhancement, in which a borrower is able to receive more affordable borrowing rates. Aspects of portfolio risk, risk management, capital adequacy, regulatory compliance and operational risk and asset-liability management are also included in many collateral management situations. A balance sheet technique is another commonly utilized facet of collateral management, which is used to maximize bank's resources, ensure asset liability coverage rules are honoured, and seek out further capital from lending excess assets. Several sub-categories such as collateral arbitrage, collateral outsourcing, tri-party repurchase agreements, and credit risk assessment are just a few of the functions addressed in collateral management.
Parties involved.
Collateral management involves multiple parties: 
Establishment of collateral relationship.
Once a new customer is identified by the Sales department, a basic credit analysis of that customer is conducted by the Credit Analysis team. Only credit-worthy customers will be allowed to trade on a non-collateralised basis. 
In the next step parties negotiate and come to the appropriate agreement. In the world's major trading centres, counterparties predominantly use ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA) standards to ensure clear and effective contracts exist before transactions begin.
Important points in the collateral agreement to be covered are:
Then the collateral teams on both sides establish the collateral relationship. Key details are communicated and entered into the two collateral systems. Some initial collateral may be posted to enable the counterparties to trade immediately in small size. Once the account is fully established the counterparties can trade freely.
Collateral management operations process.
The responsibility of the Collateral Management department is a large and complex task. Daily actions include:

Elliott Cutler

Elliot Carr Cutler CB, OBE (July 30, 1888 – August 16, 1947) was an American surgeon and medical educator. He was Moseley Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, Surgeon-in-Chief at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital from 1932 to 1947., and a Brigadier General in the U.S. Army Medical Corps.
Early life.
Cutler was born on July 30, 1888 in Bangor, Maine. He was the son of George Chalmers Cutler and Mary Franklin Wilson. His father was a lumber merchant. He was named for his maternal grandmother, Mary Elliot Carr (d. 1869), who belonged to a prominent political and mercantile family in Bangor (see Francis Carr). The Carr-Wing House remains a local landmark.
Cutler studied at Harvard College and graduated from that institution in 1909. After completing his A.B., he studied at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and received his M.D. "summa cum laude" in 1913, ranking first in his class. He studied pathology with Frank Mallory at the Boston City Hospital (now Boston Medical Center) during his fourth year at HMS. He was subsequently awarded the John Harvard Fellowship. He was also elected permanent class president.
After completing his graduation, he spent five months in Europe, mostly in London and at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, where he studied pathology with Ludolf von Krehl.
Career.
After returning from Germany, he served as surgical intern at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women's Hospital) in Boston, Massachusetts. He joined the Harvard Unit of the American Ambulance Hospital in Paris, France in 1915. He declined the invitation by William S. Halsted to run the Hunterian Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in 1916. He studied immunity at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.
The United States entered World War I in 1917. This prompted Cutler to return to France as a captain in the Army Medical Corps assigned to the Harvard Unit, Base Hospital Number 5. He returned to Boston after the end of the war. He joined the Brigham Hospital as resident surgeon. He married Caroline Pollard Parker in the spring of 1919. They had five children.
Cutler was an associate in the Department of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and also directed Harvard surgical research laboratory from 1921-23. In 1923 he performed the world’s first successful heart valve surgery. The patient was a 12-year-old girl with rheumatic mitral stenosis who underwent mitral valve repair. This surgery was hailed as a milestone by the British Medical Journal. It proved to have a mortality rate of 90 percent and it was abandoned by Cutler in 1928. Surgical repair for mitral valve stenosis was not reattempted until 1945.
Cutler left Harvard Medical School in 1924 to become professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and director of surgery at the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, where he continued his laboratory work. In 1932 he succeeded Harvey Cushing as Moseley Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and Surgeon-in-Chief at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. He held those two positions until his death in 1947.
At the outbreak of World War II, the Governor of Massachusetts appointed Cutler as medical director of the state committee on public safety. He was again called into active service in the Army Medical Corps in 1942, and was named Chief Consultant in Surgery in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). Together with William Shainline Middleton, who was the Chief Consultant in Medicine, Cutler structured the system of care for injured and sick U.S. soldiers in the ETO. Later, he served as chief of the professional services division in the office of the surgeon general in Europe. As chief surgical consultant, he played an important role in obtaining blood from the U.S. for use in treating the wounded. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General (O7) in 1945.
Cutler published papers extensively throughout his career about thyroidectomy, thoracotomy, cardiotomy, and mitral valvulotomy. He was also the co-author of the 1939 book "The Atlas of Surgery" with Robert M. Zollinger. The book remained a standard surgery textbook throughout the 20th century.
Cutler was a member of the Harvard University Board of Overseers from 1927 to 1932. He was President of the Associated Harvard Clubs from 1936 to 1937 and President of the Harvard Alumni Association from 1939 to 1940. Outside of Harvard, Cutler was a member or officer of several medical and scientific organizations, including the American Surgical Association (President, 1947), the American College of Surgeons (fellow), the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the Society for Clinical Surgery (President, 1941–46).
Cutler also served on the editorial boards of several professional publications, including the "American Heart Journal", the "Journal of Clinical Investigation", "Surgery", the "American Journal of Surgery", and the "British Journal of Surgery". He was a founder of the American Board of Surgery and the Society for Consultants to the Surgeons General of the Armed Forces of the United States. He was also elected a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Rome, Italy and an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Britain.
Later years & Death.
The later years of Cutler's life were primarily devoted to surgical practice, teaching, and research at Harvard Medical School. On August 16, 1947, he died from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate at age 59 in Brookline, Massachusetts. His son, Elliott C. Cutler, Jr., was a United States Military Academy graduate in the class of 1942. He also attained the rank of Brigadier general.
Awards and decorations.
In April 1922, Cutler received the Distinguished Service Medal for his military service in the First World War. For his contributions to military medicine in the Second World War, he received a second Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Legion of Merit from the United States War Department, the Order of the British Empire by King George VI of Britain, the Croix de Guerre by the French government, the Companion of the Order of the Bath, and Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur. In June 1947, he received the prestigious Henry Jacob Bigelow Medal of the Boston Surgical Society for his accomplishments in surgery. The Harvard Medical School established a professorship of surgery in Cutler's name in 1965.

Identi.ca

identi.ca is an open source social networking and micro-blogging service based on the pump.io software, using the Activity Streams protocol.
Features.
Identi.ca running on pump.io is similar to social networking sites like Facebook and Google+, allowing unlimited length status updates, rich text and images. The Activity Streams protocol supports many kinds of activities such as games. OpenFarmGame is a prototype application for an Activity Streams based game.
History.
StatusNet.
The service received more than 8,000 registrations and 19,000 updates within the first 24 hours of publicly launching on July 2, 2008, and reached its 1,000,000th notice on November 4, 2008. In January 2009, identi.ca received investment funds from venture capital group Montreal Start Up.
On March 30, 2009, Control Yourself (since renamed StatusNet Inc) announced that Identi.ca was to become part of a hosted microblogging service called status.net to be launched in May 2009. Status.net offers individual microblogs under a subdomain to be chosen by the customer. Identi.ca will remain a free service. All notices will be published under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license by default, but paying customers will be free to choose a different license.
Formerly based on StatusNet, a micro-blogging software package built on the OStatus specification (and earlier based on the OpenMicroBlogging specification), Identi.ca allowed users to send text updates (known as "notices") up to 140 characters long. While similar to Twitter in both concept and operation, Identi.ca/StatusNet provided many features not currently implemented by Twitter, including XMPP support and personal tag clouds. In addition, Identi.ca/StatusNet allowed free export and exchange of personal and "friend" data based on the FOAF standard; therefore, notices could be fed into a Twitter account or other service, and also ported in to a private system similar to Yammer.
pump.io.
Developer Evan Prodromou chose to change the site to the pump.io software platform in development, because pump.io offers more features and is technically more advanced. 
Registration on Identi.ca was closed in December 2012 in preparation for the switch to pump.io software (the popularity of Identi.ca and "official" Status.net hosting were considered a hindrance to the creation of a federated social network). The conversion was completed on 12 July 2013.
The 140 character per post limit was removed (in StatusNet, it was a setting, not an inherent limitation); now the blog posts can contain formatting and images. Groups, hashtags and page listing popular posts are not yet implemented in pump.io.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization

Matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) is a method for creating ions that can be used for chemical analysis in a mass spectrometer. It is related to desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and is a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization.
How it works.
In MALDESI, a pulsed laser is fired at a sample to desorb or ablate material as particles, clusters or molecules. The sample is typically at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. As with MALDI, the sample to be analyzed is mixed with a matrix material that absorbs the laser energy and aids in the laser removal of material. The neutral material interacts with charged droplets in the electrospray plume to form ions that are sampled by a mass spectrometer.
Related techniques.
Some samples form ions without the need for a matrix. The technique called electrospray-assisted laser desorption/ionization (ELDI) uses an ultraviolet laser to form ions by irradiating the sample sample directly for ion formation through interaction with the electrospray plume. The infrared laser version of ELDI has been called laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) or, alternately, infrared laser assisted desorption electrospray ionization (IR-LADESI).
In early versions of thermospray, an infrared laser was directed at a liquid spray tip to heat the sample and aid in ionization. Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) uses a jet of heated solvent for desorption and ultraviolet light for photoionization.

<doc id="18266354" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18266354" title="Johannes Agnoli">
Johannes Agnoli

Johannes Agnoli (February 22, 1925 in Valle di Cadore, Eastern Dolomites – May 4, 2003 in San Quirico di Moriano near Lucca) was a German-Italian Marxist political scientist, though he rejected the label "Marxist", preferring instead - somewhat ironically - to call himself an "Agnolist".
Agnoli grew up in Belluno, northern Italy. As a pupil, he became an admirer of Benito Mussolini's fascism and a member of the fascist youth organization, because this was considered a type of rebellion or non-bourgeois behavior. Graduating from school in 1943, he then volunteered for the "Wehrmacht", the German military, and was sent to Yugoslavia to combat Partisans. In May 1945 he was captured by the British near Trieste and became a prisoner of war in the Moascar camp in Egypt. In the re-educational classes, he aided in the philosophy course using Wilhelm Windelband's "History of Philosophy" thus also learning German. Released in the summer of 1948, he moved to Urach in Baden-Württemberg where he worked at a sawmill. Agnoli received a veteran's scholarship to study at the University of Tübingen. 
Naturalized as a German in 1955, Agnoli did his doctorate in political science about Giambattista Vico's philosophy of law under the supervision of Eduard Spranger.
In 1957, Agnoli also joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD); he would be expelled in 1961, for being a member of the Socialist German Student Union, the former college organization of the SPD, which then rebelled against the party. In 1960, he started working as the assistant of Ferdinand A. Hermens, the only political scientist at the University of Cologne at the time. In Cologne Agnoli got to know his future wife, Barbara Görres. Görres's devoutly Catholic family at first objected to her relationship with Agnoli, an atheist, even calling on Hermens to intervene. The two married in 1962. After it was reported that Agnoli called on the West German government to recognize the socialist German Democratic Republic (East Germany), he came into conflict with Hermens and his contract was not renewed. Wolfgang Abendroth, a renowned German left-wing academic, recommended Agnoli to Ossip Flechtheim of the Otto Suhr Institute at the Free University of Berlin. Agnoli worked as Flechtheim's assistant until becoming a professor in his own right in 1972.
In 1967, "Die Transformation der Demokratie" ("The Transformation of Democracy"), the book most commonly associated with Agnoli, was published. However, he only wrote one essay, constituting about one third of the book, with the social psychologist Peter Brückner authoring the rest. This book was read very widely in the German student movement of 1968, leading "Die Zeit" to refer to it as the movement's "Bible". In his essay, Agnoli discusses the question, why parliamentarianism does not allow the exploited and subaltern classes to attain power and use it in their favor. He argues that, historically, fascism was the first method of repressing social unrest by integrating the masses and thus allowing for the destruction of parliamentarianism. However, this did not turn out to be a long-term solution. Capital had to revert to parliamentarian forms of government, according to Agnoli. He argues that it was able to do so by "transforming" parliamentary rule to exclude the possibility of revolutionary insurrection. He names several methods: the prohibition of communist parties, such as the Communist Party of Germany in West Germany; giving additional power to the executive branch; the use of election threshold, which prevent small parties from entering parliaments; and finally plurality voting systems which further marginalize small radical parties. This causes a parliamentary system to become no more than a pluralistic version of one-party rule, according to Agnoli. Elections only decide which politicians get to run policies which have already been decided anyway. He viewed West Germany as the prototype of such a "transformed" parliamentary democracy, which no longer allows for revolutionary parliamentary action.
In 1991, Agnoli retired. He moved to his vacation home in Lucca, Tuscany – without his wife. He had bought the house in the 1970s. From 2000, his grown-up children cared for him, as he started losing his health. He died there in 2003. In 2004, his wife Barbara published a biography of Agnoli titled "Johannes Agnoli: Eine biografische Skizze" ("Johannes Agnoli: A biographical sketch").

StatusNet

StatusNet (formerly Laconica) is a FOSS microblogging server written in PHP that implements the OStatus standard for interoperation between installations. While offering functionality similar to Twitter, StatusNet seeks to provide the potential for open, inter-service and distributed communications between microblogging communities. Enterprises and individuals can install and control their own services and data.
Version 0.9.0, released March 3, 2010, added support for OStatus, a new distributed update standard superseding OpenMicroBlogging.
In December 2012, Evan Prodromou announced "a wind-down" of the status.net hosted service so he could concentrate on a new open source activity stream server, pump.io. Consequently, Identi.ca will also be changed to pump.io. All in the last year before May 1, 2013 active accounts will be migrated. On July 10, 2013 Identi.ca switched over to running pump.io.
June 8, 2013 it was announced StatusNet would be adopted by and renamed GNU social.
Names.
StatusNet was renamed from Laconica coinciding with the release of version 0.8.1 (aka "Second Guessing") of the StatusNet software.
StatusNet's name "simply reflects what our software does: send "status" updates into your social "net"work."
Laconica's name was a reference to the Laconic phrase, a particularly concise or terse statement the likes of which are famously attributed to the leaders of Sparta (Laconia being the Greek region containing Sparta). In microblogging, all messages are forced to be very short due to the ~140 character limit on message size, thus they are all de facto laconic phrases.
Notable deployments.
StatusNet has been deployed on several dozen public services.
The first StatusNet (as Laconica) deployment was the Identi.ca open-microblogging service. Hosted by StatusNet creators StatusNet Inc., Identi.ca offered free accounts to the public and serves as the co-flagship (along with freelish.us) for the installable version of StatusNet. The site has migrated to pump.io.
Many active StatusNet servers remain, including freesocial.org and quitter.se.

Wicked Hemlocks

The Wicked Hemlocks are a Brooklyn-based experimental psychedelic pop band.
Wicked Hemlocks is Lyndon Walker (guitar/vocals), Jamie Schmitz (percussion) and Robert Granata (synth/vocals). 
Past members: Brian McCorkle (bass/vocals), Michael Hanf (synth/vocals), Todd Baker (bass/vocals).
History.
Wicked Hemlocks began when Lyndon Walker and Jamie Schmitz aborted a 2007 effort to create the soundtrack to an avant-garde short film. The duo had met in 2006 through a friend, and although Lyndon was coming from a garage-punk background and Jamie from an electronic one, they were able to meet in the middle and plant the seeds of the psychedelic landscape that would grow into Wicked Hemlocks. According to Lyndon, The idea was to work backwards and create music with the vision of a film, and then create the film for the music. I had a vision of an underground, cultish secret society in New York that performed rituals and ceremonies cloaked in the candle-lit shadows of a dingy Brooklyn warehouse.” With this macabre imagery in mind, the two set to work on a bevy of haunting, original pieces. When the filmmakers backed out, however, Lyndon and Jamie were left with a finished score and no visuals to accompany it. Instead of scrapping the material, they formed the Wicked Hemlocks, and put the songs out as an album aptly titled “Quill of the Mad” under alias label Stick in Your Spokes Records.
To support the album, Lyndon and Jamie tried to put together a live show with a number of other people, but when that became too complex, they returned to writing and released the “Lonely Places” demo. “As soon as the demo happened we had a clear vision of where the next album was going, and we knew for sure we could play it live, so we kept driving,” Lyndon says. In February 2008 the duo met up with Brian McCorkle, who was playing as the one-man project What Color Is Your Machine Gun. Lyndon and Jamie found themselves on the same musical plane as Brian, and they decided to head up to a farmhouse in Brattleboro, VT to record. They set up in a barn, accompanied by some “psychedelic experiences,” and began to lay down the tracks that would become their self-titled album. The new material features harmonies and melodies reminiscent of 60s psych-pop.
After recording the album, the band found a van and began playing shows in July 2008. Michael Hanf (who played with Lindsay Holler and Absalan in South Carolina) joined in October 2008 to solidify the line-up.

Uncommon Friends of the 20th Century

Uncommon Friends of the 20th Century is a 1999 documentary film on Florida businessman James D. Newton and the relationships he enjoyed with five key historic figures: Thomas A. Edison, Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone and Alexis Carrel. The film, which was directed by first-time filmmaker John Biffar and narrated by Walter Cronkite, included interviews with Newton (who was 94 years old at the time of production), archival footage and dramatic re-enactments.
The film had a brief theatrical release, and reviews were mostly negative. Lawrence Van Gelder, writing in "The New York Times", called the film “a weak broth of biography, spiritual uplift and environmental concerns” and added “its generally uncritical and sometimes apologetic posture (Lindbergh's acceptance of a Nazi medal) and its failure to distinguish between its authentic film images and its re-enactments of events.” Nico Baumbach, writing in "The Village Voice", stated that Newton’s “anecdotes are so unspecific that his ostensible authority, the premise of the film, feels like a put-on.” 
"Uncommon Friends of the 20th Century" was broadcast on public television in 2000. To date, the film has not been available as a commercial DVD release. However, copies of the film can be purchased from the Uncommon Friends Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by James D. Newton that provides educational scholarships to business students.

<doc id="18266484" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18266484" title="History of the Catholic Church">
History of the Catholic Church

Catholic doctrine teaches that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ. It interprets the Confession of Peter as acknowledging Christ's designation of Apostle Peter "and" his successors to be the temporal head of his Church. Thus, it asserts that the Bishop of Rome has the sole legitimate claim to Petrine authority and the primacy due to the Roman Pontiff. The Catholic Church claims legitimacy for its bishops and priests via the doctrine of apostolic succession and authority of the Pope via the unbroken line of popes, claimed as successors to Simon Peter.
In 313, the struggles of the Early Church were lessened by the legalisation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380, under Emperor Theodosius I, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree of the Emperor, which would persist until the fall of the Western Empire, and later, with the Eastern Roman Empire, until the Fall of Constantinople. During this time (the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils) there were considered five primary sees according to Eusebius: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria, known as the Pentarchy.
After the destruction of the western Roman Empire, the church in the West was a major factor in the preservation of classical civilization, establishing monasteries, and sending missionaries to convert the peoples of northern Europe, as far as Ireland in the north. In the East, the Byzantine Empire preserved Orthodoxy, well after the massive invasions of Islam in the mid-7th century. The invasions of Islam devastated three of the five Patriarchal sees, capturing Jerusalem first, then Alexandria, and then finally in the mid-8th century, Antioch.
The whole period of the next five centuries was dominated by the struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The battles of Poitiers, and Toulouse preserved the Catholic west, even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850, and Constantinople besieged. In the 11th century, already strained relations between the primarily Greek church in the East, and the Latin church in the West, developed into the East-West Schism, partially due to conflicts over Papal Authority. The fourth crusade, and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach.
In the 16th century, in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Church engaged in a process of substantial reform and renewal known as the Counter-Reformation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of Protestantism and also because of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent three centuries before.
Church beginnings.
Origins.
Catholic tradition holds that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ. The New Testament records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles, and his instructions to them to continue his work. The Catholic Church teaches that the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as Pentecost, signaled the beginning of the public ministry of the Church. Peter is also thought to be Rome's first bishop and the consecrator of Linus as its next bishop, thus starting the line which includes the most current pontiff, Pope Francis. Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's well-defined network of roads and waterways allowed easier travel, while the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants, especially those in urban areas, to learn Greek, and the common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood. Jesus's apostles gained converts in Jewish communities around the Mediterranean Sea, and over 40 Christian communities had been established by 100. Although most of these were in the Roman Empire, notable Christian communities were also established in Armenia, Iran and along the Indian Malabar Coast. The new religion was most successful in urban areas, spreading first among slaves and people of low social standing, and then among aristocratic women.
At first, Christians continued to worship alongside Jewish believers, which historians refer to as Jewish Christianity, but within twenty years of Jesus's death, Sunday was being regarded as the primary day of worship. As preachers such as Paul of Tarsus began converting Gentiles, Christianity began growing away from Jewish practices to establish itself as a separate religion, though the issue of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism is still debated today. To resolve doctrinal differences among the competing factions within the Church, in or around the year 50, the apostles convened the first Church council, the Council of Jerusalem. This council affirmed that Gentiles could become Christians without adopting all of the Mosaic Law. Growing tensions soon led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Christians refused to join in the Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132, however some groups of Christians retained elements of Jewish practice.
The early Christian Church was very loosely organized, resulting in diverse interpretations of Christian beliefs. In part to ensure a greater consistency in their teachings, by the end of the 2nd century Christian communities had evolved a more structured hierarchy, with a central bishop having authority over the clergy in his city, leading to the development of the Metropolitan bishop. The organization of the Church began to mimic that of the Empire; bishops in politically important cities exerted greater authority over bishops in nearby cities. The churches in Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome held the highest positions. Beginning in the 2nd century, bishops often congregated in regional synods to resolve doctrinal and policy issues. Duffy claims that by the 3rd century, the bishop of Rome began to act as a court of appeals for problems that other bishops could not resolve.
Doctrine was further refined by a series of influential theologians and teachers, known collectively as the Church Fathers. From the year 100 onward, proto-orthodox teachers like Ignatius of Antioch and Irenaeus defined Catholic teaching in stark opposition to other things, such as Gnosticism. In the first few centuries of its existence, the Church formed its teachings and traditions into a systematic whole under the influence of theological apologists such as Pope Clement I, Justin Martyr and Augustine of Hippo.
Persecutions.
Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism, see Idolatry. Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians–including government authorities–to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. In addition, the peculiar intimacy of Christian society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism; the resulting persecutions, although usually local and sporadic, were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century. A series of more centrally organized persecutions of Christians emerged in the late 3rd century, when emperors decreed that the Empire's military, political, and economic crises were caused by angry gods. All residents were ordered to give sacrifices or be punished. Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000. Many fled or renounced their beliefs. Disagreements over what role, if any, these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Novatianist schisms.
Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consistent: "Tiberius wanted to have Christ placed in the Pantheon and refused first of all to persecute the Christians. Later on his attitude changed. [-] How are we to explain the fact that men like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christians? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rather favoured them."
In spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted, leading to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313. By 380, Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire. Religious philosopher Simone Weil wrote: " By the time of Constantine, the state of apocalyptic expectation must have worn rather thin. imminent coming of Christ, expectation of the Last Day - constituted 'a very great social danger.' Besides , the spirit of the old law, so widely separated from all mysticism, was not so very different from the Roman spirit itself. Rome could come to terms with the God of Hosts." 
Late antiquity.
When Constantine became emperor of the Western Roman Empire in 312, he attributed his victory to the Christian God. Many soldiers in his army were Christians, and his army was his base of power. With Licinius, (Eastern Roman emperor), he issued the Edict of Milan which mandated toleration of all religions in the empire. The edict had little effect on the attitudes of the people. New laws were crafted to codify some Christian beliefs and practices. Constantine's biggest effect on Christianity was his patronage. He gave large gifts of land and money to the Church and offered tax exemptions and other special legal status to Church property and personnel. These gifts and later ones combined to make the Church the largest landowner in the West by the 6th century. Many of these gifts were funded through severe taxation of pagan cults. Some pagan cults were forced to disband for lack of funds; when this happened the Church took over the cult's previous role of caring for the poor. 
In a reflection of their increased standing in the Empire, clergy began to adopt the dress of the royal household, including the cope. Acts 8:9-21
During Constantine's reign, approximately half of those who identified themselves as Christian did not subscribe to the mainstream version of the faith. Constantine feared that disunity would displease God and lead to trouble for the Empire, so he took military and judicial measures to eliminate some sects. To resolve other disputes, Constantine began the practice of calling ecumenical councils to determine binding interpretations of Church doctrine.
Decisions made at the Council of Nicea (325) about the divinity of Christ led to a schism; the new religion, Arianism flourished outside the Roman Empire. Partially to distinguish themselves from Arians, Catholic devotion to Mary became more prominent. This led to further schisms.
In 380, mainstream Christianity–as opposed to Arianism–became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Christianity became more associated with the Empire, resulting in persecution for Christians living outside of the empire, as their rulers feared Christians would revolt in favor of the Emperor. In 385, this new legal authority of the Church resulted in the first use of capital punishment being pronounced as a sentence upon a Christian 'heretic', namely Priscillian.
During this period, the Bible as it has come down to the 21st century was first officially laid out in Church Councils or Synods through the process of official 'canonization'. Prior to these Councils or Synods, the Bible had already reached a form that was nearly identical to the form in which it is now found. According to some accounts, in 382 the Council of Rome first officially recognized the Biblical canon, listing the accepted books of the "Old" and "New Testament", and in 391 the Vulgate Latin translation of the Bible was made.
Other accounts list the Council of Carthage of 397 as the Council that finalized the Biblical canon as it is known today.
The Council of Ephesus in 431 clarified the nature of Jesus' incarnation, declaring that he was both fully man and fully God.
Two decades later, the Council of Chalcedon solidified Roman papal primacy which added to continuing breakdown in relations between Rome and Constantinople, the see of the Eastern Church.
Also sparked were the Monophysite disagreements over the precise nature of the incarnation of Jesus which led to the first of the various Oriental Orthodox Churches breaking away from the Catholic Church.
Middle Ages.
Early Middle Ages.
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, the Catholic faith competed with Arianism for the conversion of the barbarian tribes. The 496 conversion of Clovis I, pagan king of the Franks, saw the beginning of a steady rise of the faith in the West.
In 530, Saint Benedict wrote his "Rule of St Benedict" as a practical guide for monastic community life. Its message spread to monasteries throughout Europe. Monasteries became major conduits of civilization, preserving craft and artistic skills while maintaining intellectual culture within their schools, scriptoria and libraries. They functioned as agricultural, economic and production centers as well as a focus for spiritual life. During this period the Visigoths and Lombards moved away from Arianism for Catholicism. Pope Gregory the Great played a notable role in these conversions and dramatically reformed the ecclesiastical structures and administration which then launched renewed missionary efforts. Missionaries such as Augustine of Canterbury, who was sent from Rome to begin the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, and, coming the other way in the Hiberno-Scottish mission, Saints Colombanus, Boniface, Willibrord, Ansgar and many others took Christianity into northern Europe and spread Catholicism among the Germanic, and Slavic peoples, and reached the Vikings and other Scandinavians in later centuries. The Synod of Whitby of 664, though not as decisive as sometimes claimed, was an important moment in the reintegration of the Celtic Church of the British Isles into the Roman hierarchy, after having been effectively cut off from contact with Rome by the pagan invaders.
In the early 8th century, Byzantine iconoclasm became a major source of conflict between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church. Byzantine emperors forbade the creation and veneration of religious images, as violations of the Ten Commandments. Other major religions in the East such as Judaism and Islam had similar prohibitions. Pope Gregory III vehemently disagreed. A new Empress Irene siding with the pope, called for an Ecumenical Council. In 787, the fathers of the Second Council of Nicaea "warmly received the papal delegates and his message". At the conclusion, 300 bishops, who were led by the representatives of Pope Hadrian I "adopted the Pope's teaching", in favor of icons.
With the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III in 800, his new title as "Patricius Romanorum," and the handing over of the keys to the Tomb of Saint Peter, the papacy had acquired a new protector in the West. This freed the pontiffs to some degree from the power of the emperor in Constantinople but also led to a schism, because the emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople interpreted themselves as the true descendants of the Roman Empire dating back to the beginnings of the Church. Pope Nicholas I had refused to recognize Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople, who in turn had attacked the pope as a heretic, because he kept the filioque in the creed, which referred to the Holy Spirit emanating from God the Father" and" the Son. The papacy was strengthened through this new alliance, which in the long term created a new problem for the Popes, when in the Investiture Controversy succeeding emperors sought to appoint bishops and even future popes. After the disintegration of the Charlemagne empire and repeated incursions of Islamic forces into Italy, the papacy, without any protection, entered a phase of major weakness.
High Middle Ages.
The Cluniac reform of monasteries that began in 910 placed abbots under the direct control of the pope rather than the secular control of feudal lords, thus eliminating a major source of corruption. This sparked a great monastic renewal. Monasteries, convents and cathedrals still operated virtually all schools and libraries, and often functioned as credit establishments promoting economic growth. After 1100, some older cathedral schools split into lower grammar schools and higher schools for advanced learning. First in Bologna, then at Paris and Oxford, many of these higher schools developed into universities and became the direct ancestors of modern Western institutions of learning. It was here where notable theologians worked to explain the connection between human experience and faith. The most notable of these theologians, Thomas Aquinas, produced "Summa Theologica", a key intellectual achievement in its synthesis of Aristotelian thought and the Gospel. Monastic contributions to western society included the teaching of metallurgy, the introduction of new crops, the invention of musical notation and the creation and preservation of literature.
During the 11th century, the East–West schism permanently divided Christianity. It arose over a dispute on whether Constantinople or Rome held jurisdiction over the church in Sicily and led to mutual excommunications in 1054. The Western (Latin) branch of Christianity has since become known as the Catholic Church, while the Eastern (Greek) branch became known as the Orthodox Church. The Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439) both failed to heal the schism. Some Eastern churches have since reunited with the Catholic Church, and others claim never to have been out of communion with the pope. Officially, the two churches remain in schism, although excommunications were mutually lifted in 1965.
The 11th century saw the Investiture Controversy between Emperor and Pope over the right to make church appointments, the first major phase of the struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe. The Papacy were the initial victors, but as Italians divided between Guelphs and Ghibellines in factions that were often passed down through families or states until the end of the Middle Ages, the dispute gradually weakened the Papacy, not least by drawing it into politics. The Church also attempted to control, or exact a price for, most marriages among the great by prohibiting, in 1059, marriages involving consanguinity (blood kin) and affinity (kin by marriage) to the seventh degree of relationship. Under these rules, almost all great marriages required a dispensation. The rules were relaxed to the fourth degree in 1215 (now only the first degree is prohibited by the Church - a man cannot marry his stepdaughter, for example).
Pope Urban II launched the First Crusade in 1095 when he received an appeal from Byzantine emperor Alexius I to help ward off a Turkish invasion. Urban further believed that a Crusade might help bring about reconciliation with Eastern Christianity. Fueled by reports of Muslim atrocities against Christians, the series of military campaigns known as the Crusades began in 1096. They were intended to return the Holy Land to Christian control. The goal was not permanently realized, and episodes of brutality committed by the armies of both sides left a legacy of mutual distrust between Muslims and Western and Eastern Christians. The sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade left Eastern Christians embittered, despite the fact that Pope Innocent III had expressly forbidden any such attack. In 2001, Pope John Paul II apologized to the Orthodox Christians for the sins of Catholics including the sacking of Constantinople in 1204.
Two new orders of architecture emerged from the Church of this era. The earlier Romanesque style combined massive walls, rounded arches and ceilings of masonry. To compensate for the absence of large windows, interiors were brightly painted with scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. Later, the Basilique Saint-Denis marked a new trend in cathedral building when it utilized Gothic architecture. This style, with its large windows and high, pointed arches, improved lighting and geometric harmony in a manner that was intended to direct the worshiper's mind to God who "orders all things". In other developments, the 12th century saw the founding of eight new monastic orders, many of them functioning as Military Knights of the Crusades. Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux exerted great influence over the new orders and produced reforms to ensure purity of purpose. His influence led Pope Alexander III to begin reforms that would lead to the establishment of canon law. In the following century, new mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán which brought consecrated religious life into urban settings.
12th century France witnessed the growth of Catharism in Languedoc. It was in connection with the struggle against this heresy that the Inquisition originated. After the Cathars were accused of murdering a papal legate in 1208, Pope Innocent III declared the Albigensian Crusade. Abuses committed during the crusade caused Innocent III to informally institute the first papal inquisition to prevent future massacres and root out the remaining Cathars. Formalized under Gregory IX, this Medieval inquisition executed an average of three people per year for heresy at its height. Over time, other inquisitions were launched by the Church or secular rulers to prosecute heretics, to respond to the threat of Moorish invasion or for political purposes. The accused were encouraged to recant their heresy and those who did not could be punished by penance, fines, imprisonment, torture or execution by burning.
A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France during a period known as the Avignon Papacy. The papacy returned to Rome in 1378 at the urging of Catherine of Siena and others who felt the See of Peter should be in the Roman church. With the death of Pope Gregory XI later that year, the papal election was disputed between supporters of Italian and French-backed candidates leading to the Western schism. For 38 years, separate claimants to the papal throne sat in Rome and Avignon. Efforts at resolution further complicated the issue when a third compromise pope was elected in 1409. The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the Council of Constance where the cardinals called upon all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming Martin V pope.
Renaissance and reforms.
Discoveries and Missionaries.
Through the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Pope Alexander VI, in the papal bull Inter caetera, awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal. Under the "patronato" system, state authorities controlled clerical appointments and no direct contact was allowed with the Vatican. On December 1511, the Dominican friar Antonio de Montesinos openly rebuked the Spanish authorities governing Hispaniola for their mistreatment of the American natives, telling them "... you are in mortal sin ... for the cruelty and tyranny you use in dealing with these innocent people". King Ferdinand enacted the "Laws of Burgos" and "Valladolid" in response. Enforcement was lax, and while some blame the Church for not doing enough to liberate the Indians, others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples. The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain. An outpouring of self-criticism and philosophical reflection among Catholic theologians, most notably Francisco de Vitoria, led to debate on the nature of human rights and the birth of modern international law.
In 1521, through the leadership and preaching of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the first Catholics were baptized in what became the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia, the Philippines. The following year, Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico, and sought to convert the Indians and to provide for their well-being by establishing schools and hospitals. They taught the Indians better farming methods, and easier ways of weaving and making pottery. Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly human and deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or Sublimis Deus (1537) confirmed that the Indians were deserving people. Afterward, the conversion effort gained momentum. Over the next 150 years, the missions expanded into southwestern North America. The native people were legally defined as children, and priests took on a paternalistic role, often enforced with corporal punishment. Elsewhere, in India, Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among non-Christians and a Christian community which claimed to have been established by Thomas the Apostle.
Renaissance Church.
In Europe, the Renaissance marked a period of renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. It also brought a re-examination of accepted beliefs. Cathedrals and churches had long served as picture books and art galleries for millions of the uneducated. The stained glass windows, frescoes, statues, paintings and panels retold the stories of the saints and of biblical characters. The Church sponsored great Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, who created some of the world's most famous artworks. The acceptance of humanism had its effects on the Church, which embraced it as well. In 1509, a well known scholar of the age, Erasmus, wrote "The Praise of Folly," a work which captured a widely held unease about corruption in the Church. The Papacy itself was questioned by conciliarism expressed in the councils of Constance and the Basel. Real reforms during these ecumenical councils and the Fifth Lateran Council were attempted several times but thwarted. They were seen as necessary but did not succeed in large measure because of internal feuds within the Church, ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Saracenes and the simony and nepotism practiced in the Renaissance Church of the 15th and early 16th centuries. As a result, rich, powerful and worldly men like Roderigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) were able to win election to the papacy.
Reformation Era wars.
The Fifth Lateran Council issued some but only minor reforms in March 1517. A few months later, on October 31, 1517, Martin Luther posted his "Ninety-Five Theses" in public, hoping to spark debate. His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences. Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and others also criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges, supported by powerful political forces in the region, developed into the Protestant Reformation. In Germany, the Reformation led to war between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict, the Thirty Years' War, which broke out in 1618. In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots and the forces of the French Catholic League. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes, which granted civil and religious toleration to Protestants.
England.
The English Reformation was ostensibly based on Henry VIII's desire for annulment of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, and was initially more of a political, and later a theological dispute. The Acts of Supremacy made the English monarch head of the English church thereby establishing the Church of England. Then, beginning in 1536, some 825 monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were dissolved and Catholic churches were confiscated. When he died in 1547 all monasteries, friaries, convents of nuns and shrines were destroyed or dissolved. Mary I of England reunited the Church of England with Rome and, against the advice of the Spanish ambassador, persecuted Protestants during the Marian Persecutions. After some provocation, the following monarch, Elizabeth I enforced the Act of Supremacy. This prevented Catholics from becoming members of professions, holding public office, voting or educating their children. Executions of Catholics under Elizabeth I, who reigned much longer, then surpassed the Marian persecutions and persisted under subsequent English monarchs. Penal laws were also enacted in Ireland but were less effective than in England. In part because the Irish people associated Catholicism with nationhood and national identity, they resisted persistent English efforts to eliminate the Catholic Church.
Council of Trent.
Historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, in his book "The Reformation, A History" noted that through all the slaughter of the Reformation era emerged the valuable concept of religious toleration and an improved Catholic Church which responded to doctrinal challenges and abuses highlighted by the Reformation at the Council of Trent (1545–1563). The council became the driving-force of the Counter-Reformation, and reaffirmed central Catholic doctrines such as transubstantiation, and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. It also reformed many other areas of importance to the Church, most importantly by improving the education of the clergy and consolidating the central jurisdiction of the Roman Curia. The criticisms of the Reformation were among factors that sparked new religious orders including the Theatines, Barnabites and Jesuits, some of which became the great missionary orders of later years. Spiritual renewal and reform were inspired by many new saints like Teresa of Avila, Francis de Sales and Philip Neri whose writings spawned distinct schools of spirituality within the Church (Oratorians, Carmelites, Salesian), etc. Improvement to the education of the laity was another positive effect of the era, with a proliferation of secondary schools reinvigorating higher studies such as history, philosophy and theology. To popularize Counter-Reformation teachings, the Church encouraged the Baroque style in art, music and architecture. Baroque religious expression was stirring and emotional, created to stimulate religious fervor.
Elsewhere, Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier introduced Christianity to Japan, and by the end of the 16th century tens of thousands of Japanese followed Roman Catholicism. Church growth came to a halt in 1597 under the Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi who, in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences, launched a severe persecution of Christians. Japanese were forbidden to leave the country and Europeans were forbidden to enter. Despite this, a minority Christian population survived into the 19th century.
Baroque, Enlightenment and revolutions.
Marian devotions.
The Council of Trent generated a revival of religious life and Marian devotions in the Roman Catholic Church. During the Reformation, the Church had defended its Marian beliefs against Protestant views. At the same time, the Catholic world was engaged in ongoing Ottoman Wars in Europe against Turkey which were fought and won under the auspices of the Virgin Mary. The victory at the Battle of Lepanto (1571) was accredited to her "and signified the beginning of a strong resurgence of Marian devotions, focusing especially on Mary, the Queen of Heaven and Earth and her powerful role as mediatrix of many graces". The Colloquium Marianum, an elite group, and the Sodality of Our Lady based their activities on a virtuous life, free of cardinal sins.
Pope Paul V and Gregory XV ruled in 1617 and 1622 to be inadmissible to state, that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. Supporting the belief that she was born without original sin, through the intended protection of God's grace (aka Immaculate Conception). Alexander VII declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered the feast of the Immaculata for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the Rosary was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742. Popular Marian piety was even more colourful and varied than ever before: Numerous Marian pilgrimages, "Marian Salve" devotions, new Marian litanies, Marian theatre plays, Marian hymns, Marian processions. Marian fraternities, today mostly defunct, had millions of members.
Enlightenment secularism.
The Enlightenment constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the Protestant Reformation, which questioned certain Christian doctrines, the enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human reason above divine revelation and down-graded religious authorities such as the papacy based on it. Parallel the Church attempted to fend off Gallicanism and Councilarism, ideologies which threatened the papacy and structure of the Church.
Toward the latter part of the 17th century, Pope Innocent XI viewed the increasing Turkish attacks against Europe, which were supported by France, as the major threat for the Church. He built a Polish-Austrian coalition for the Turkish defeat at Vienna in 1683. Scholars have called him a saintly pope because he reformed abuses by the Church, including simony, nepotism and the lavish papal expenditures that had caused him to inherit a papal debt of 50,000,000 scudi. By eliminating certain honorary posts and introducing new fiscal policies, Innocent XI was able to regain control of the church's finances. In France, the Church battled Jansenism and Gallicanism, which supported Conciliarism, and rejected papal primacy, demanding special concessions for the Church in France. This weakened the Church's ability to respond to gallicanist thinkers such as Denis Diderot, who challenged fundamental doctrines of the Church.
In 1685 gallicanist King Louis XIV of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, ending a century of religious toleration. France forced Catholic theologians to support conciliarism and deny Papal infallibility. The king threatened Pope Innocent XI with a general council and a military take-over of the Papal state. The absolute French State used Gallicanism to gain control of virtually all major Church appointments as well as many of the Church's properties. State authority over the Church became popular in other countries as well. In Belgium and Germany, Gallicanism appeared in the form of Febronianism, which rejected papal prerogatives in an equal fashion. Emperor Joseph II of Austria (1780–1790) practiced Josephinism by regulating Church life, appointments, and massive confiscation of Church properties.
Church in North America.
In what is now the Western United States, the Catholic Church expanded its missionary activity but, until the 19th century, had to work in conjunction with the Spanish crown and military. Junípero Serra, the Franciscan priest in charge of this effort, founded a series of missions and presidios in California which became important economic, political, and religious institutions. These missions brought grain, cattle and a new political and religious order to the Indian tribes of California. Coastal and overland routes were established from Mexico City and mission outposts in Texas and New Mexico that resulted 13 major California missions by 1781. European visitors brought new diseases that killed off a third of the native population, primarily through disease. Mexico shut down the missions in the 1820s and sold off the lands. Only in the 19th century, after the breakdown of most Spanish and Portuguese colonies, was the Vatican able to take charge of Catholic missionary activities through its Propaganda Fide organization.
Church in South America.
During this period the Church faced colonial abuses from the Portuguese and Spanish governments. In South America, the Jesuits protected native peoples from enslavement by establishing semi-independent settlements called reductions. Pope Gregory XVI, challenging Spanish and Portuguese sovereignty, appointed his own candidates as bishops in the colonies, condemned slavery and the slave trade in 1839 (papal bull In Supremo Apostolatus), and approved the ordination of native clergy in spite of government racism.
Jesuits.
Jesuits in India.
Christianity in India has a tradition of Thomas establishing the faith in Kerala. The community was very small until the Jesuit Francis Xavier (1502–1552) began missionary work. Roberto de Nobili (1577–1656), a Tuscan Jesuit missionary to Southern India followed in his path. He pioneered (inculturation), adopting many Brahmin customs which were not, in his opinion, contrary to Christianity. He lived like a Brahmin, learned Sanskrit, and presented Christianity as a part of Indian beliefs, not identical with the Portuguese culture of the colonialists. He permitted the use of all customs, which in his view did not directly contradict Christian teachings. By 1640 there were 40 000 Christians in Madurai alone. In 1632, Pope Gregory XV gave permission for this approach. But strong anti-Jesuit sentiments in Portugal, France even in Rome resulted in a reversal, which signalled the end of the successful Catholic missions in India. On September 12, 1744, Benedict XIV forbade the so-called Malabar rites in India, with the result, that leading Indian casts who wanted to adhere to their traditional cultures, turned away from the Catholic Church.
Jesuits in China.
Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci, Adam Schall von Bell and others successfully introduced Christianity to China via inculturation. Ricci and Schall were appointed by the Chinese Emperor as court mathematicians and astronomers and even Mandarins. The first Catholic Church was built in Peking in 1650 The emperor granted freedom of religion to Catholics. Ricci adopted the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy in 1692 and 1742. The Bull "Ex Quo Singulari" of Pope Benedict XIV of 1742 stressed the purity of Christian teachings and traditions, which must be uphold against all heresies. This bull virtually destroyed the Jesuit goal of Christianizing the influential upper classes in China. The Church experienced missionary setbacks in 1721 when the Chinese Rites controversy led the Kangxi Emperor to outlaw Christian missions.
In 1939 Pope Pius XII reverted the 250 year old Vatican policy and permitted the veneration of dead family members. The Church began to flourish again with twenty new arch-dioceses, seventy-nine dioceses and thirty-eight apostolic prefects, but only until 1949, when the Communist revolution took over the country.
Jesuit existence.
Throughout the inculturation controversy, the very existence of Jesuits were under attack in Portugal, Spain, France, and the Kingdom of Sicily. The inculturation controversy and the Jesuit support for the native Indians in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina added fuel to growing criticism of the order, which seemed to symbolize the strength and independence of the Church. Defending the rights of native peoples in South America, hindered the efforts of Spain and Portugal to maintain absolute rule over their domains. Portugal's Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal was the main enemy of the Jesuits. Pope Benedict XIV attempted to keep the Jesuits in existence without any changes: "Sint ut sunt aut not sint, They must be the way they are or they will not be,". He went far to mollify Portuguese pride, even allowing the local Cardinal to wear a papal tiara and have his seminarians dressed like cardinals In 1773, European rulers united to force Pope Clement XIV to dissolve the order. Several decades later Pius VII restored the Jesuits in the 1814 papal bull Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum.
On March 13, 2013, Pope Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, became the first member of the Jesuit order to be elected pope. Pope Francis was elected on the second day of the papal conclave.
French Revolution.
The anti-clericalism of the French Revolution. saw direct attacks on the wealth of the Church and associated grievances led to the wholesale nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church. Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the National Assembly, leading to the Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of "Reason". In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000 priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed.
When Pope Pius VI sided against the revolution in the First Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy. The 82 year old pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February 1799 and died in Valence August 29, 1799 after six months of captivity. To win popular support for his rule, Napoleon re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The end of the Napoleonic wars, signaled by the Congress of Vienna, brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.
19th century France.
France remained basically Catholic. The 1872 census of 1872, counted 36 million people, of whom 35.4 million were listed as Catholics, 600,000 as Protestants, 50,000 as Jews and 80,000 as freethinkers The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church, and Napoleon's concordat of 1801 restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in 1814 brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church, seeing it as a bastion of conservatism and monarchism. However the monasteries with their vast land holdings and political power were gone; much of the land had been sold to urban entrepreneurs who lacked historic connections to the land and the peasants. Few new priests were trained in the 1790-1814 period, and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790 to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly. Entire regions, especially around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand some traditional regions held fast to the faith, led by local nobles and historic families. The comeback was slow—very slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and a new emphasis on liturgy and devotions to the Virgin Mary, plus support from Napoleon III, there was a comeback. In 1870 there were 56,500 priests, representing a much younger and more dynamic force in the villages and towns, with a thick network of schools, charities and lay organizations. Conservative Catholics held control of the national government, 1820-1830, but most often played secondary political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans, liberals, socialists and seculars.
Third Republic 1870-1940.
Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the Monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and of boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals. Napoleon's 1801 Concordat continued in operation but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.
The 1882 school laws of Republican Jules Ferry set up a national system of public schools that taught strict puritanincal morality but no religion. For a while privately funded Catholic schools were tolerated. Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced and chaplains were removed from the army.
When Leo XIII became pope in 1878 he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884 he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In 1892 he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the Dreyfus Affair. Catholics were for the most part anti-dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal "La Croix". This infuriated Republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry (1899–1902) and the Combes Ministry (1902–05) fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals (1903–04), and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs (1904). Combes as Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain. In 1805 the 1801 Concordat was abrogated; Church and State were finally separated. All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. In practise, Masses and rituals continued. The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests. In the long run, however, it gained autonomy—for the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.
Africa.
At the end of the 19th century, Catholic missionaries followed colonial governments into Africa and built schools, hospitals, monasteries and churches.
Industrial age.
First Vatican Council.
Before the council, in 1854 Pope Pius IX with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851–1853, proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.
During First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested to add the words "Immaculate Virgin" to the Hail Mary. Some fathers requested, the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the Creed of the Church, which was opposed by Pius IX 
Many French Catholics wished the dogmatization of Papal infallibility and the assumption of Mary by the ecumenical council. During Vatican One, nine mariological petitions favoured a possible assumption dogma, which however was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially from Germany. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a very small breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church.
Social teachings.
The Industrial Revolution brought many concerns about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers. Influenced by the German Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, in 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical "Rerum Novarum", which set in context Catholic social teaching in terms that rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. "Rerum Novarum" argued for the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions.
Quadragesimo Anno was issued by Pope Pius XI, on 15 May 1931, 40 years after Rerum Novarum. Unlike Leo, who addressed mainly the condition of workers, Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. He noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity, arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism.
The social teachings of Pope Pius XII repeat these teachings, and apply them in greater detail not only to workers and owners of capital, but also to other professions such as politicians, educators, house-wives, farmers, bookkeepers, international organizations, and all aspects of life including the military. Going beyond Pius XI, he also defined social teachings in the areas of medicine, psychology, sport, television, science, law and education. "There is virtually no social issue, which Pius XII did not address and relate to the Christian faith." He was called ""the Pope of Technology," for his willingness and ability to examine the social implications of technological advances. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the space age at the end of his pontificate, Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites on the social fabric of humanity asking for a new sense of community and solidarity in light of existing papal teachings on subsidiarity.
Role of women's institutes.
Catholic women have played a prominent role in providing education and health services in keeping with Catholic social teaching. Ancient orders like the Carmelites had engaged in social work for centuries. The 19th century saw a new flowering of institutes for women, dedicated to the provision of health and education services - of these the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco, Claretian Sisters and Franciscan Missionaries of Mary became among the largest Catholic women's religious institutes of all.
The Sisters of Mercy was founded by Catherine McAuley in Ireland in 1831, and her nuns went on to establish hospitals and schools across the world. The Little Sisters of the Poor was founded in the mid-19th century by Saint Jeanne Jugan near Rennes, France, to care for the many impoverished elderly who lined the streets of French towns and cities. In Britain's Australian colonies, Australia's first canonised Saint, Mary MacKillop, co-founded the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart as an educative religious institute for the poor in 1866, going on to establish schools, orphanages and refuges for the needy. In 1872, the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco (also called Daughters of Mary Help of Christians) was founded by Maria Domenica Mazzarello. The teaching order was to become the modern world's largest institute for women, with around 14,000 members in 2012. Saint Marianne Cope opened and operated some of the first general hospitals in the United States, instituting cleanliness standards which influenced the development of America's modern hospital system. Also in the United States, Saint Katharine Drexel founded Xavier University of Louisiana to assist African and Native Americans.
Mariology.
Popes have always highlighted the inner link between the Virgin Mary as Mother of God and the full acceptance of Jesus Christ as Son of God.
Since the 19th century, they were highly important for the development of mariology to explain the veneration of Mary through their decisions not only in the area of Marian beliefs (Mariology) but also Marian practices and devotions. Before the 19th century, Popes promulgated Marian veneration by authorizing new Marian feast days, prayers, initiatives, the acceptance and support of Marian congregations. Since the 19th century, Popes begin to use encyclicals more frequently. Thus Leo XIII, the Rosary Pope issued eleven Marian encyclicals. Recent Popes promulgated the veneration of the Blessed Virgin with two dogmas, Pius IX the Immaculate Conception in 1854 and the Assumption of Mary in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. Pius XII also promulgated the new feast Queenship of Mary celebrating Mary as Queen of Heaven and he introduced the first ever Marian year in 1954, a second one was proclaimed by John Paul II. Pius IX, Pius XI and Pius XII facilitated the veneration of Marian apparitions such as in Lourdes and Fátima. Later Popes such from John XXIII to Benedict XVI promoted the visit to Marian shrines (Benedict XVI in 2007 and 2008). The Second Vatican Council highlighted the importance of Marian veneration in Lumen Gentium. During the Council, Paul VI proclaimed Mary to be the Mother of the Church.
Anti-clericalism.
The 20th century saw the rise of various politically radical and anti-clerical governments. The 1926 Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero War in which over 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated, churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped and captured priests shot. In the Soviet Union following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, persecution of the Church and Catholics continued well into the 1930s. In addition to the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements and closure of churches was common. During the 1936–39 Spanish Civil War, the Catholic hierarchy supported Francisco Franco's rebel Nationalist forces against the Popular Front government, citing Republican violence directed against the Church. The Church had been an active element in the polarising politics of the years preceding the Civil War. Pope Pius XI referred to these three countries as a "terrible triangle" and the failure to protest in Europe and the United States as a "conspiracy of silence".
Dictatorships.
Italy.
Pope Pius XI aimed to end the long breach between the papacy and the Italian government and to gain recognition once more of the sovereign independence of the Holy See. Most of the Papal States had been seized by the armies of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy (1861–1878) in 1860 suing Italian unification. Rome itself was seized by force in 1870 and the pope became the "prisoner in the Vatican." The Italian government's policies had always been anti-clerical until the First World War, when some compromises were reached. 
To bolster his own dictatorial Fascist regime, Benito Mussolini was also eager for an agreement. Agreement was reached in 1929 with the Lateran Treaties, which helped both sides. According to the terms of the first treaty, Vatican City was given sovereignty as an independent nation in return for the Vatican relinquishing its claim to the former territories of the Papal States. Pius XI thus became a head of a tiny state with its own territory, army. radio station, and diplomatic representation. The Concordat of 1929 made Catholicism the sole religion of Italy (although other religions were tolerated), paid salaries to priests and bishops, recognized church marriages (previously couples had to have a civil ceremony), and brought religious instruction into the public schools. In turn the bishops swore allegiance to the Italian state, which had a veto power over their selection. The Church was not officially obligated to support the Fascist regime; the strong differences remained but the seething hostility ended. The Church especially endorsed foreign policies such as support for the anti-Communist side in the Spanish Civil War, and support for the conquest of Ethiopia. Friction continued over the Catholic Action youth network, which Mussolini wanted to merge into his Fascist youth group. A compromise was reached with only the Fascists allowed to sponsor sports teams.
Italy paid the Vatican 1750 million lira (about $100 million) for the seizures of church property since 1860. Pius XI invested the money in the stock markets and real estate. To manage these investments, the Pope appointed the lay-person Bernadino Nogara, who through shrewd investing in stocks, gold, and futures markets, significantly increased the Catholic Church's financial holdings. The income largely paid for the upkeep of the expensive-to-maintain stock of historic buildings in the Vatican which previously had been maintained through funds raised from the Papal States up until 1870.
The Vatican's relationship with Mussolini's government deteriorated drastically after 1930 as Mussolini's totalitarian ambitions began to impinge more and more on the autonomy of the Church. For example, the Fascits tried to absorb the Church's youth groups. In response Pius XI issued the encyclical "Non Abbiamo Bisogno" ("We Have No Need)") in 1931. It denounced the regime's persecution of the church in Italy and condemned "pagan worship of the State."
Austria and Nazi Germany.
The Vatican supported the Christian Socialists in Austria, a country with a majority Catholic population but a powerful secular element. Pope Pius XI favored the regime of Engelbert Dollfuss (1932–34), who wanted to remold society based on papal encyclicals. Dollfuss suppressed the anti-clerical elements and the socialists, but was assassinated by the Austrian Nazis in 1934. His successor Kurt von Schuschnigg (1934–38) was also pro-Catholic and received Vatican support. Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and imposed its own policies.
Pius XI was prepared to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. The Concordat of 1933 included guarantees of liberty for the Church in Nazi Germany, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.
Nazi ideology was spearheaded by Heinrich Himmler and the SS. In the struggle for total control over German minds and bodies, the SS developed an anti-religious agenda. No Catholic or Protestant chaplains were allowed in its units (although they were allowed in the regular army). Himmler established a special unit to identify and eliminate Catholic influences. The SS decided the German Catholic Church was a serious threat to its hegemony and while it was too strong to be abolished it was partly stripped of its influence, for example by closing its youth clubs and publications.
After repeated violations of the Concordat, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical "Mit brennender Sorge" which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority.
World War II.
After the Second World War began in September 1939, the Church condemned the invasion of Poland and subsequent 1940 Nazi invasions. In the Holocaust, Pope Pius XII directed the Church hierarchy to help protect Jews from the Nazis. While Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews. the Church has also been falsely accused of encouraging antisemitism Albert Einstein, addressing the Catholic Church's role during the Holocaust, said the following: "Being a lover of freedom, when the revolution came in Germany, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but, no, the universities immediately were silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone by had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks...
"Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly." This quote appeared in the December 23, 1940 issue of Time magazine on page 38. Other commentators have accused Pius of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. Debate over the validity of these criticisms continues to this day.
Post-Industrial age.
Second Vatican Council.
The Catholic Church engaged in a comprehensive process of reform following the Second Vatican Council (1962–65). Intended as a continuation of Vatican I, under Pope John XXIII the council developed into an engine of modernisation. It was tasked with making the historical teachings of the Church clear to a modern world, and made pronouncements on topics including the nature of the church, the mission of the laity and religious freedom. The council approved a revision of the liturgy and permitted the Latin liturgical rites to use vernacular languages as well as Latin during mass and other sacraments. Efforts by the Church to improve Christian unity became a priority. In addition to finding common ground on certain issues with Protestant churches, the Catholic Church has discussed the possibility of unity with the Eastern Orthodox Church.
Reforms.
Changes to old rites and ceremonies following Vatican II produced a variety of responses. Some stopped going to church, while others tried to preserve the old liturgy with the help of sympathetic priests. These formed the basis of today's Traditionalist Catholic groups, which believe that the reforms of Vatican II have gone too far. Liberal Catholics form another dissenting group who feel that the Vatican II reforms did not go far enough. The liberal views of theologians such as Hans Küng and Charles Curran, led to Church withdrawal of their authorization to teach as Catholics. According to Professor Thomas Bokenkotter, most Catholics "accepted the changes more or less gracefully." In 2007, Benedict XVI eased permission for the optional old Mass to be celebrated upon request by the faithful.
A new "Codex Juris Canonici" - Canon Law called for by John XXIII, was promulgated by Pope John Paul II on January 25, 1983. It includes numerous reforms and alterations in Church law and Church discipline for the Latin Church. It replaced the 1917 version issued by Benedict XV.
Theology.
Liberation theology.
In the 1960s, growing social awareness and politicization in the Latin American Church gave birth to liberation theology. The Peruvian priest, Gustavo Gutiérrez, became it primary proponent and, in 1979, the bishops' conference in Mexico officially declared the Latin American Church's "preferential option for the poor". Archbishop Óscar Romero, a supporter of the movement, became the region's most famous contemporary martyr in 1980, when he was murdered while celebrating Mass by forces allied with the government. Both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI (as Cardinal Ratzinger) denounced the movement. The Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff was twice ordered to cease publishing and teaching. While Pope John Paul II was criticized for his severity in dealing with proponents of the movement, he maintained that the Church, in its efforts to champion the poor, should not do so by resorting to violence or partisan politics. The movement is still alive in Latin America today, though the Church now faces the challenge of Pentecostal revival in much of the region.
Sexuality and gender issues.
The sexual revolution of the 1960s brought challenging issues for the Church. Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical "Humanae Vitae" reaffirmed the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations and asserted a continued proscription of artificial birth control. In addition, the encyclical reaffirmed the sanctity of life from conception to natural death and asserted a continued condemnation of both abortion and euthanasia as grave sins which were equivalent to murder.
Efforts to lead the Church to consider the ordination of women led Pope John Paul II to issue two documents to explain Church teaching. "Mulieris Dignitatem" was issued in 1988 to clarify women's equally important and complementary role in the work of the Church. Then in 1994, "Ordinatio Sacerdotalis" explained that the Church extends ordination only to men in order to follow the example of Jesus, who chose only men for this specific duty.
Catholicism today.
Sex abuse cases.
Major lawsuits emerged in 2001 claiming that priests had sexually abused minors. In response to the ensuing scandal, the Church has established formal procedures to prevent abuse, encourage reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness.
Some priests resigned, others were defrocked and jailed, and there were financial settlements with many victims. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned a comprehensive study that found that four percent of all priests who served in the US from 1950 to 2002 had faced some sort of accusation of sexual misconduct.
Benedict XVI.
With the election of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the Church has so far seen largely a continuation of the policies of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, with some notable exceptions: Benedict decentralized beatifications and reverted the decision of his predecessor regarding papal elections. In 2007, he set a Church record by approving the beatification of 498 Spanish Martyrs. His first encyclical "Deus Caritas Est" discussed love and sex in continued opposition to several other views on sexuality.
Roman Catholic attempts to improve ecumenical relations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches have been complicated by disputes over both doctrine and the recent history of the Orthodox Eastern Catholic Churches, involving the return of expropriatiated properties of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which the Orthodox Church took over after World War II at the request of Joseph Stalin.

Water resources.
According to the United Nations' "UN World Water Development Report", the total actual renewable water resources decreased from 2,961 m³ per capita in 2000 to 1,420 m³ per capita in 2005. A more recent study indicates an available supply of water of little more than 1,000 m³ per person, which puts Pakistan in the category of a high stress country. Using data from the Pakistani federal government's Planning and Development Division, the overall water availability has decreased from 1,299 m³ per capita in 1996-97 to 1,101 m³ per capita in 2004-05. In view of growing population, urbanization and increased industrialization, the situation is likely to get worse. Nevertheless, excessive mining of groundwater goes on. Despite a lowering water table, the annual growth rate of electric tubewells has been indicated to 6.7% and for diesel tubewells to about 7.4%. In addition, increasing pollution and saltwater intrusion threaten the country's water resources. About 36% of the groundwater is classified as highly saline.
In urban areas, most water is supplied from groundwater except for the cities of Karachi, Hyderabad and a part of Islamabad, where mainly surface water is used. In most rural areas, groundwater is used. In rural areas with saline groundwater, irrigation canals serve as the main source of domestic water.
Water use.
Out of the 169,384 billion m³ of water which were withdrawn in 2000, 96% were used for agricultural purposes, leaving 2% for domestic and another 2% for industrial use. By far most water is used for irrigated agriculture, emphasizing the particular significance of agriculture in the country. The sector contributes about 25% of the Pakistan's GNP (2000-2001). The country still has the world's largest contiguous irrigation system. In 1999-2000, the total irrigated area in Pakistan was 181,000 km².
Water is also essential for power generation in Pakistan, since about 29% is generated through hydropower.

St. James' Catholic Church (Louisville, Kentucky)

St. James Church is a historic Roman Catholic church located at 1826 Edenside Avenue in the Highlands section of Louisville, Kentucky. March 1, 1982, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. James Roman Catholic Church, Rectory, and School.
History.
The parish of St. James was established in 1906 as the subdivisions in the surrounding area were rapidly being built up (three churches within a few blocks of St. James also trace their foundation to 1906). An initial wood frame church was built in 1906 on the site of the present building, as was a wood frame school building which was replaced with the modern brick school building in 1924. The parish house was completed in 1929.
Construction began on the modern church building in 1912 and was completed in 1913. It was designed by J.J. Gaffney, a local architect who designed buildings such as the Belvoir Apartments in Cherokee Triangle, the baroque house on Highland Avenue, Adath Jeshuran Temple and Holy Name Church.

Terenuthis

Terenuthis was a town in Ancient Egypt. Located roughly on the spot of the modern town of Tarrana, approximately 70 km north of Cairo in the western delta, it was named after the ancient Egyptian god Renenutet. Renenutet is one of the most ancient gods in the Egyptian pantheon, and in later worship was merged with other Egyptian gods like Wadjet. Renenutet was possibly a local protecting deity in pre-dynastic times, as Terenuthis is the oldest known center of her cult.
Tarrana in the Province of Beherah replaces Terenuthis, now known as Kom Abu Billo, the ruins of which lie about a mile and a quarter to the west. About nine miles away are Lake Nitria and Lake Scetis, near which were the lavras of these names, Nitria and Scetis.
After Egypt became a Roman possession, Terenuthis was incorporated into the Roman province of Aegyptus Prima.
There are archaeological remains dating at least from the Middle Kingdom. There is a necropolis. From the Ptolemaic period dates a (now mostly destroyed) temple dedicated to Hathor-Thermutis originally built by Ptolemaeus I and II.
Christianity.
Terenuthis became a bishopric that, being in the province of Aegyptus Prima was a suffragan of Alexandria and is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees. Le Quien mentions two of its bishops: Arsinthius in 404; Eulogius at the First Council of Ephesus in 431.
The monks sometimes sought refuge in Terenuthis during incursions of the Maziks. John Moschus went there at the beginning of the 7th century. There is frequent mention of Terenuthis in Christian Coptic literature.

Lochs' theorem

In number theory, Lochs' theorem is a theorem concerning the rate of convergence of the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. A proof of the theorem was published by Gustav Lochs in 1964.
The theorem states that for almost all real numbers in the interval (0,1), the number of terms "m" of the number's continued fraction expansion that are required to determine the first "n" places of the number's decimal expansion behaves asymptotically as follows:
As this limit is only slightly smaller than 1, this can be interpreted as saying that each additional term in the continued fraction representation of a "typical" real number increases the accuracy of the representation by approximately one decimal place. The decimal system is the last positional system for which each digit carries less information than one continued fraction quotient; going to base-11 (changing formula_2 to formula_3 in the equation) makes the above value exceed 1.
The reciprocal of this limit,
is twice the base-10 logarithm of Lévy's constant.

Nyali Bridge

The Nyali Bridge is a concrete girder bridge connecting the city of Mombasa on Mombasa Island to the mainland of Kenya. The bridge crosses Tudor Creek (a tidal inlet) to the north-east of the island. The bridge is one of three road links out of Mombasa (the others being the Kipevu and Makupa Causeways). The Likoni Ferry provides a third transport link to the island, and is situated at the southern tip. The mainland approach to the bridge serves as a police checkpoint in both directions.
Cost.
The "Old Nyali Bridge" (a floating bridge) stood approximately 800 m downstream from the current crossing.
The bridge was constructed through loan acquired by government from Japan in 1976. The loan amount was JPY 4,900,000,000 (approx Kshs. 2,631,300,000). 
The Exchange rate at the time was $1=JPY305.15 (Equivalent of $16m if adjusted for inflation using inflation calculator would be $66m)
Details.
It is 391.65 metres long and 26.3 metres wide with a total of six lanes. The main bridge is 330 metres prestressed continuous box girder over three spans with the centre span of 150 metres. The outer spans are 90 metres each. The bridge is founded on piled foundation. Nyali Bridge includes an approach bridge with three spans totaling 61.65 metres whose superstructure is simply reinforced concrete beams and deck. Since its completion in 1980, no periodic maintenance was done to the bridge until 2005 when major repairs to the bridge were carried out. The repairs included post tensioning the box girder and shear strengthening using crack sealing and use of steel plates on the internal face of the box girder.

Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia

The Universidad Católica San Antonio ("Saint Anthony Catholic University"), also known as the Universidad Católica de Murcia (UCAM), is a private university located in Murcia in southeastern Spain. Founded in 1996 by José Luis Mendoza Pérez, a lay Catholic, with the permission of Bishop Javier Azagra Labiano of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cartagena, UCAM offers undergraduate and graduate programs in a variety of fields, as well as summer courses open to international students. The university is characterized by a firm commitment to Catholic orthodoxy and the moral and social doctrines of the Church.
History.
In 1978 Pope John Paul I promulgated the Apostolic Constitution "Ex Corde Ecclesiae", which made allowance, in Article 3.3, for the establishment of Catholic universities by laypersons. Prior to "Ex Corde Ecclesiae", only clergy and religious, along with affiliated institutions such as regional episcopal conferences and religious societies, were authorized under canon law to found institutes of higher learning under the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church. The document reflects the directives of the Second Vatican Council, which called for increased lay participation in the Church's liturgical and administrative life.
UCAM, the brainchild of founder José Luis Mendoza Pérez, was the first such university to be established under the new conditions presented in Article 3.3. A member of the Pontifical Council for the Family and father of 14 children, Mendoza serves as president of the university.
At its establishment in 1996, UCAM had a population of approximately 600 students. its population had expanded to over 10,000.
Campus.
UCAM is located in Guadalupe just outside the city of Murcia (capital of the eponymous region of Murcia). At the heart of the campus is the Monastery of Los Jerónimos, an 18th-century edifice originally built for the Hieronymite order of monks. The monastery forms the main administration building, which thus resembles a cloister in structure: four hallways forming a rectangle around a central open courtyard. The school's chapel is part of the original structure. Also present are several newly constructed buildings housing classrooms and faculty offices.
Studies offered.
Currently, UCAM offers undergraduate degrees in 18 fields of study and graduate degrees in 36 fields of study (27 Master's programs and 15 Ph.D. programs in overlapping subjects).
Relationship with the professional world.
The university maintains connections with over 150 other colleges worldwide. Preparation for working life is part of the education program at UCAM, which also has an established network of business contacts to help ensure employment for its alumni after graduation.
UCAM and the "New Evangelization" of Pope John Paul II.
Throughout his pontificate Pope John Paul II made reference to the need for a "new evangelization," a method by which the modern world could be effectively engaged with and evangelized to by the Catholic Church. The principles of this new evangelization are laid out most fully in the apostolic letter Novo Millennio Ineunte ("At the Beginning of the New Millennium"), promulgated at the close of the year 2000.
UCAM's stance toward the secular world is informed by this notion, as can be seen in the Letter from the President introducing English-speaking foreign students to UCAM. According to Mendoza, the university has
a vocation both to teach and evangelise in the academic, scientific and cultural world and provide an instrument in Faith to solve the many questions and problems of contemporary society and in this way contribute to social, cultural and human development and progress.
Fundamentally, then, UCAM is supposed to be a Christian institution in dialogue with the modern world for the purposes of evangelization and the improvement of human society as a whole.
Focus.
The academic environment at UCAM, though rigorous, is also relatively informal, and the administration encourages a collegial, debate-oriented relationship between faculty and students. Though offering courses in a wide variety of subjects, at its heart UCAM is about engaging the world from a Christian perspective; philosophical, theological, ethical and political issues are approached accordingly.

78th Attack Squadron

The 78th Attack Squadron (78 ATKS) is part of the Tenth Air Force, Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas. The 78 ATKS conducts operations from Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in conjunction with their active-duty associates in the Air Force Warfare Center.
Mission.
The mission of the 78th Attack Squadron is to maintain combat-ready reservists to train and equip the Combat Air Forces to conduct Integrated and Expeditionary Combat Operations, as well as training operations, in the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned Aerial Systems.
The squadron consists of RPA pilots, sensor operators and intelligence personnel integrated into Regular Air Force units within the 432d Air Expeditionary Wing at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada.
History.
The 78th was organized in 1917 at Rich Field, Waco, Texas as a training unit. In February 1918 moved to Hicks Field, Fort Worth, Texas before being demoilized. In 1931, the 78th Pursuit Squadron was again activated and assigned to the 20th Pursuit Group at Mather Field, California flying single-seat Boeing P-12 biplane fighters.
During World War II the unit was recognized and stationed in the Pacific theater where the unit flew P-39s, P-40s, and P-51s. With a combat record from the war of 200 enemy aircraft destroyed or damaged, versus the loss of only six aircraft assigned to the unit. The 78th received the Distinguished Unit Citation for actions at the Musashino Plant, Tokyo, Japan, on 7 April 1945.
On the 1 November 1952 the 78th Fighter Interceptor Squadron was reactivated, flying F-86 Sabre aircraft as part of the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. In 1954 the 81st became a Fighter Bomber Wing and the assigned squadrons began flying the F-84 Thunderjet. Then in 1958, the 78th received its first F-101 Voodoo aircraft.
While flying the A-10 Thunderbolt II at RAF Woodbridge the squadron deployed to Incirlik Air Base Turkey in 1991, where it took part in Operation Provide Comfort. Later after inactivation and reactivation at Shaw Air Force Base and flying the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the 78th began a regular rotation of deployments to patrol the Northern and Southern No-Fly Zones of Iraq, the last of which took place in mid to late 2002, when they deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. The squadron also performed combat operations in Kosovo from March to June 1999.
The 78th was prepared to again deploy to Turkey in preparation for Operation Iraqi Freedom, however, the Turkish government denied the use of its nation as a staging area against Iraq. Consequently, the 78th stood down and was inactivated. The personnel and F-16CJ equipment of the 78th transferred to the 55th Fighter Squadron. In April 2006 the 78th was reactivated and redesignated as the 78th Reconnaissance Squadron, with the unit flying the MQ-1 Predator. In July, 2010, with the gaining of the MQ-9 Reaper mission, the unit was redesignated the 78th Attack Squadron.

<doc id="18266777" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18266777" title="Decoupled debit card">
Decoupled debit card

A decoupled debit card is a debit card in the US that is not issued by, and not tied to, a particular retail financial institution, such as a bank or credit union. This is based on the ability in the US ACH payment system to make an electronic payment from any bank or credit union without needing to use a card issued by the bank or credit union. A third party, such as a retailer, can create a decoupled debit card which will use this system to make a payment from the customers checking account. They may do this as part of a loyalty scheme or to reduce their own debit card processing costs.
History.
In May 2007, Capital One began a one year decoupled debit card experiment. This card was novel in that prior to this launch, a debit card was always tied to a traditional financial institution. Capital One's Mastercard-branded decoupled card did not require an account be opened with a retail financial institution, and was made in partnership with the Ukrops grocery chain, based in Capital One's hometown of Richmond, Virginia. The card was also tied to a reward program offered by Ukrops. The one-year experiment ended in May 2008, and was followed by a national rollout of its own version of a decoupled debit card tied to its own reward program.
Decoupled Debit gained the attention of the financial services industry in May 2007 when Capital One announced they were going to add a decoupled debit card product. At the time Capital One did not offer checking accounts—only credit cards and this was a strategy to offer a debit card without actually owning the checking account relationship. The one year pilot ended without Capital One citing specific reasons as why, leaving the industry with only speculation as to why.
Today, decoupled debit cards are typically issued and branded by retailers without any association to a national network such as Visa, MasterCard or Amex. The retailer has complete control over the issuing of the cards to their customers and the processing of the payment. By definition, decoupled debit cards are processed via the Federal Reserve ACH System as the mechanism for reaching a consumer’s checking account as a debit to their account for their purchase. The payment side of the product operates like an electronic check, but the product is more than just a payment card.
When the Durbin Amendment became law in October 2011, there was new speculation that this was the end of decoupled debit. At the time there were only two main companies offering decoupled debit: Tempo and National Payment Card Association. Tempo did in fact close their doors shortly after the roll-out of the Durbin Amendment—National Payment Card Association (NPCA) did not and is still thriving today in 2013.
Why one survived Durbin and the other did not is a function of their differences in business models and program structures. Tempo had a product model tied to Discover and accepted signature debit which resulted in a pricing model and risk profile that would no longer be attractive to retailers under Durbin.
National Payment Card Association has a different pricing model – generally a fixed price per transaction of $.15 that retailers pay in processing fees, which is still very competitive even under Durbin regulation. The company also has a well articulated and easily understood value proposition for retailers:
Retailers reap swipe fee savings when they have a National Payment Card program when compared to what they pay in swipe fees for accepting Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc. The savings are used to fund rewards to the retailer’s customers which provides the incentive to the consumer to carry another payment card in their wallet.
The Target Red Card program is a great example of how the value proposition works. Consumers enroll with Target, provide their checking account to be debited and receive 5% discount at the register when they use the Red Card to pay. Target saves the fees they would have otherwise paid to the payment networks and banks and gives the savings back to their customers.
NPCA on the other hand has developed their niche in c-store petroleum. The programs offer consumers an instant price rollback at the pump of anywhere between 3 cents and 10 cents off per gallon of fuel purchased. 
The programs offer another benefit to retailers and that is in building a customer data base. Since the consumer enrolls (generally online) into the program, the retailer gains baseline information about their cardholders (name, address, phone number, email addresses, etc.) and they gain the ability to track spending. This is information banks typically have when a customer uses a bank-issued payment card. Now the retailer has the information and can mine the data for use in targeted marketing to their customers.
On a going forward basis, the real payoff for decoupled debit might very well end up to be mobile payments. The most noted program in this early life cycle of mobile payment using decoupled debit is Cumberland Farms SmartPay. In this program, consumers can have a mobile payment app, a traditional mag stripe card, or both. The program tracks lifetime savings within the app and coupons and promotions can be delivered to the app while the Cumberland Farms customers are fueling.
In October 2014 payments technology firm FIS announced a new private label, decoupled debit product called InterPaymentTM. InterPayment utilizes proprietary FIS technology and payment processing platforms to offer retail merchants the ability to implement a branded program quickly and easily. 
In late 2013 FIS was named to the Forbe's list of the World's Top 100 Most Innovative Companies.

The Nyali Bridge was a floating pontoon bridge linking Mombasa Island to the Kenyan mainland.
The bridge linked the Mzizima district of Mombasa to Nyali, and was built in 1931.
In 1980, the bridge was superseded by the New Nyali Bridge (located approximately to the north), leaving the steel bridge to be dismantled for scrap. The western (Mombasa) approach to the bridge is the only remaining part of the bridge but one of the pontoon mooring anchors is on nearby display at the Tamarind Restaurant.

Mechanical Bulls

Mechanical Bulls (also known as Mechanical Bulls RFC) are an Irish amateur rugby union team based in Munster, that competes in the annual Kinsale Sevens tournament. They finished runners up in the Friday competition, and reached the quarter finals in the Plate, to record their best ever finish in the Kinsale Sevens 2008. Mechanical Bulls are an invitation only team, similar to the Barbarians. Their main home ground is at the University of Limerick pitches.
The Mechanical Bulls were formed in 2006 at the University of Limerick, by a group of engineers. It began as a 15s rugby union team, and remains undefeated in that code. It constantly enters a team in the Kinsale Sevens competition, and together with their very distinctive cow pattern jerseys, remain probably the most popular team in the tournament. The Bulls are also well known for their incredible fan support and game day atmosphere (the deafening noise during play and complete silence during an attempt to kick a goal). Mechanical Bulls players play in a black and white jersey, white shorts and black and white socks. The Mechanical Bulls logo of a bulls head and two wrenchs in the form of a skull and crossbones, in reference to both the marauding spirit of the team and as a homage to the original team name, The Buckfast Buccaneers. The bulls head symbolises the pride, strength and unity in the team, while the wrenchs represent the teams history in being founded by engineers.
History.
First Games.
The first match in the history of the Bulls took place against a team of 3rd year Engineers. A close match saw the Bulls just edge it, no mean feat for a team that had only one hour of training together under their belt. The rematch a week later saw a much more efficient and confident performance by the Bulls dispatch the 3rd Year pretenders by a scoreline of 56-12. That victory provided two cases of Miller for the Bulls, which were duly dispatched with the same level of ruthlessness evident in the match. To this day, the Bulls are still unbeaten in 15s rugby.
Kinsale Sevens 2007.
Kinsale Sevens 2007 saw a tough education for the Bulls (then named Buckfast Buccaneers) as they failed to win a game in the competition. This did however prove to be a pivotal moment in the history of the team, as it was then and there that the Mechanical Bulls as we know them today were formed.
Dunbrody Sevens 2007.
Dunbrody Sevens was the next competition, and while the team continued its rapid improvement and managed to get their first victory, it will forever be remembered as the weekend they almost lost their vital prop Richard McEvoy to pneumonia and disappearance.
Kinsale Sevens 2008.
A break of almost ten months followed, before the Bulls triumphant return to form happened. They returned to Kinsale for the 2008 Sevens competition (under the new name, crest and colours of Mechanical Bulls), finishing 2nd in the Friday evening competition, before making it to the quarter finals of the Plate on Saturday. The harsh lessons learned the previous year had truly been taken to heart...
Future.
On the 8th July 2008, it was confirmed that the Mechanical Bulls would be entering the Dunbrody Sevens 2008 tournament, where they hope to continue their development and improvement by at least equalling or bettering the previous years results.
Colours and crest.
The Mechanical Bulls current kit manufacturers are OB Sport. Their playing kit consists of black and white patterned jersey, white shorts, and black socks with white trim.
The crest consists of a bulls head and two wrenchs similar in position to a skull and crossbones. The similarity to the pirate symbol is twofold - Firstly, to symbolise the marauding spirit of the Mechanical Bulls, and secondly, as a type of homage to the original name of the team - The Buckfast Buccaneers. The bulls head symbolises the pride, strength and unity which exists in the team, while the wrenchs represent the teams origins of being founded by University of Limerick engineers.
Home grounds.
While the Mechanical Bulls do not have an official home ground, they play all home matches at the UL Pitches, Castletroy. The Pitches have a capacity of 500, and is currently undergoing redevelopment work to increase that to 600. Munster Rugby also train on these pitches.

Sozusa in Palaestina

Sozusa in Palaestina was a city in the late Roman province of Palaestina Prima, and its episcopal see was a suffragan of Caesarea, the capital of the province.
It is to be distinguished from Sozusa in Libya, earlier known as Apollonia in Cyrenaica, which is now the modern city of Marsa Susa.
History.
Like the Libyan city, Sozusa in Palaestina was at first called Apollonia. It is mentioned by Pliny, "Hist. nat.", V, 14, and Ptolemy, V, xv, 2, between Cæsarea and Joppa, and by other geographers. According to Josephus, "Ant. jud.", XIII, xv, 4, it belonged at first to the Phoenicians. From Appianus, "Hist. rom. Syr.", 57, it seems to have been founded by a King Seleucus, whose name it was given, but the history of this maritime city and the date of its establishment; are entirely unknown. The Roman proconsul, Gabinius, found it ruined in 57 BC, and had it rebuilt (Josephus, "Bel. jud.", I, viii, 4).
On the arrival of the Crusaders it was called Arsuf (Arsur or Azuffium), and was protected by strong walls; Godfrey de Bouillon attempted to capture it, but failed for want of ships (William of Tyre, IX, x). King Baldwin I took it in 1102, after a siege by land and sea, allowing the inhabitants to withdraw to Ascalon. Occupied in 1191 by Saladin, the town was captured by Richard Cœur de Lion after his victory at Rochetaillée. In 1251 St. Louis re-erected its ramparts, and fourteen years later, in 1265, after a siege of forty days, it was stormed by the sultan Baibars; the inhabitants were killed or sold as slaves and the town completely razed.
It never recovered, and in the 14th century the geographer Abulfeda said it contained no inhabitants ("Tabula Syriæ", 82).
Today its ruins may be seen at Arsûf, north of Jaffa.
Bishops.
The name Apollonia was already replaced by Sozusa when in 449 at the Robber Council of Ephesus Baruchius signed with this title. Its bishops, Leontius in 518, and Damianus in 553, are also known (Le Quien, "Oriens christianus", III, 595). Under the name of Sozusa it occurs in the Byzantine geographers Hierocles and George of Cyprus.
In the Middle Ages it was confused with Antipatris, situated more inland, and it is under this name that the titular see was assigned to some of its titular bishops.

Franz John

Franz Adolf Louis John (born 28 September 1872 in Pritzwalk, died 17 November 1952 in Berlin) was a German photographer. He was one of the initiators of the founding of FC Bayern Munich and its first president from 1900 to 1903.
He was born on 28 September 1872 in Pritzwalk (Brandenburg), the son of Friedrich Wilhelm and Ida John. After moving with his parents to Pankow at the fringe of Berlin, he later joined the football club VfB Pankow. There he met Gustav Manning, who afterwards became secretary of the German Football Association. Manning later helped John to integrate the Munich football clubs into the DFB. After his apprenticeship as a photographer in Jena John moved to Munich where he became a member of MTV 1879 Munich.
When on 27 February 1900 the steering committee of MTV prohibited the football division of its club to join the association of southgerman football clubs (SFV), eleven football players left the club under the lead of Franz John. In the restaurant "Gisela" they founded the "Munich Football Club Bayern" and elected Franz John for president. John also founded the council of Bavarian referees.
Under his lead the club joined the SFV still in its first year and quickly became a force in the Munich football scene. In 1903 John left FC Bayern and was succeeded as president by the Dutch Willem Hesselink. John also left Munich in 1904, moving back to Pankow, where he opened a photo laboratory and later became president of his home club VfB Pankow. Despite having few contacts to Munich John was in the 1920s elected as honorary president of the FC Bayern Munich and in 1936 he received the needle of honour in gold from the club.
Grown lonely he died on 17 November 1952 in Pankow; he had no descendants. Journalist Joachim Rechenberg later traced his lost grave to Fürstenwalde. When in 2000 the FC Bayern celebrated its 100th anniversary, the club recreated the grave and donated a new tombstone to commemorate the merits of Franz John.

2008 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11

These are the profiles for the individual stages in the 2008 Tour de France, with Stage 1 on 5 July, and Stage 11 on 16 July.
Stages.
Stage 1.
For the first time since 1967, the tour started with a road stage rather than the traditional prologue. The stage was hilly with four fourth category climbs through the Monts d'Arrée in the department of Finistère. The finish at Plumelec is uphill on the "Côte de Cadoual", with a 1.7 km climb at 6.2%. As there were no time bonuses in the three intermediate sprints, the first rider home wore the yellow jersey at the start of stage 2.
An eight-man breakaway formed at the 3 km mark, and it got away for some time. At the first feeding station, Hervé Duclos-Lassalle crashed and sustained a broken left wrist, becoming the first rider to have to abandon the 2008 Tour. At about the 30 km to go mark, two in the break, Lilian Jegou and David de la Fuente got away from the other six after a short series of attacks and counter-attacks. The peloton, paced by Silence-Lotto, increased pace when the other six rejoined them, and Jegou and de la Fuente were caught at around the 7 km to go mark. At that point, the peloton split into several groups for the run in toward the finish, won by Alejandro Valverde. One of the pre-race favourites, Mauricio Soler, fell with 20 km remaining and lost more than three minutes.
Stage 1 Result and General Classification after Stage 1
Stage 2.
The second stage was another hilly stage, with three fourth category climbs and the third category "wall" at Mûr-de-Bretagne.
Sylvain Chavanel and Thomas Voeckler established a breakaway at the first categorized climb, reaching a maximum advantage of 6'25" before being joined by Agritubel teammates Christophe Moreau and David Lelay with 57 km remaining. The four Frenchmen were caught by the peloton in the final 2 km, and the sprint was won by Thor Hushovd.
Stage 3.
Stage 3 was flat, with no ranking climbs, which was expected to favour the sprinters at the finish alongside the River Loire in Nantes.
A four-man breakaway formed at the 9 km mark, comprising William Frischkorn, Samuel Dumoulin, Paolo Longo Borghini, and Romain Feillu. They quickly took the three intermediate sprints available on the course and had a maximum advantage of 14 minutes before the peloton began to reel them in. Several teams helped with the workload to bring the breakaway back. With the day's early rain saturating the road, Fabian Wegmann crashed around 60 km in, needing to change his bike minutes later.
For many kilometers, the time gap didn't decrease beyond about 6'30" to 6'45", leading to speculation that the four in the breakaway could survive to the line. The teams of the prominent sprinters came forward to make a faster pace at around 35 km to go. With about 23 km to go, Ángel Gómez and Nicki Sørensen were involved in a crash that split the peloton into three fragments, the second of which contained the white jersey Riccardo Riccò and Denis Menchov, finished 38 seconds behind the first, which contained the yellow jersey Alejandro Valverde. The third group contained Christophe Moreau. Gómez eventually had to abandon the Tour.
The breakaway survived to the finish, giving the Tour a new maillot jaune for the next day's individual time trial. Dumoulin won the sprint to the line.
Stage 4.
The fourth stage was an individual time trial over a flat course to the west of Cholet in the department of Maine-et-Loire.
Denis Menchov and Jens Voigt set nearly identical times about two-thirds of the way into the time trial, with Menchov one second better. It stood as best until reigning world time trial champion and stage favorite Fabian Cancellara gained a one second advantage, despite having been behind Menchov's and Voigt's pace at both intermediate time checks. The surprise of the day came when Stefan Schumacher beat Cancellara by 33 seconds, having similar leads at each time check. Cadel Evans, David Millar, and Kim Kirchen also beat Cancellara, but could not match Schumacher.
As was expected, the top three men in the GC, having been in a breakaway almost the entire previous day, fell in the overall standings after the time trial, and the Tour had its third different rider in yellow at the day's end.
Stage 5.
This was the longest stage of the 2008 tour, over flat roads in the departments of Maine-et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres, Vienne, Indre-et-Loire and Indre.
Mauricio Soler fell in the neutral zone before the start; already suffering injuries from a fall on the opening day, the Colombian who won the polka-dot jersey last year finally succumbed and retired from the race at the 11 km mark of stage five.
The stage was led almost from start to finish by three breakaway riders. The French trio of Lilian Jegou, Florent Brard and national champion Nicolas Vogondy opened up a gap of more than eight minutes, which was slowly whittled away by the chasing peloton. Vogondy broke away from his compatriots in the final 1.5 km, only to be overhauled by the sprinters around 30 metres from the line.
Mark Cavendish, who was led out by his German team-mate Gerald Ciolek, held off late attacks from Thor Hushovd, Óscar Freire and Erik Zabel, and pulled away from his rivals in the final metres to claim glory after almost five-and-a-half hours in the saddle.
Stage 6.
This was the first mountain stage of the tour through the Massif Central, with two Fourth Category climbs in the first half of the race before the riders crossed the Second Category Col de la Croix-Morand after 158 km. The finish is at the ski station of Super Besse on the slopes of Puy de Sancy with a climb of 11 km at an average gradient of 4.7%, including the final 1.5 km with a maximum gradient of 10%.
A three-man breakaway, made up of Frenchmen Sylvain Chavanel, Benoît Vaugrenard and Freddy Bichot, claimed the sprints and the two small category 4 climbs early on in the stage. The group attained a maximum lead of 5'15" after 95 km. The main field split on the climb of the Col de la Croix-Morand, with many of the sprinters and leadout men fell back into an "autobus", and many short-lived attempts to catch the two remaining riders from the breakaway, Vaugrenard having been dropped.
Chavanel and Bichot survived to the top of the Col de la Croix-Morand, giving Chavanel sufficient points on the day's climbs to gain the lead in the King of the Mountains classification, but he was caught with 20m remaining, and Bichot 7 km later. The autobus rejoined the second peloton on the descent from the Col de la Croix-Morand, before the field split into several small groups again. Riders who posed no threat to the GC attacked on the way up to Super-Besse, and the yellow jersey group, still being paced by Caisse d'Epargne, let them all go. Even when Christian Vande Velde, sixth overall and a member of the first place team Garmin-Chipotle, launched an attack, Caisse d'Epargne did not respond.
Finally, at the 1 kilometer to go mark, the peloton came forward to bring back those who had broken away. Virtually all of the GC contenders were at the front of the main group. The last of Valverde's teammates peeled off to open the sprint to the line, won by Riccardo Riccò. In seeking a position for the final sprint, the yellow jersey wearer Stefan Schumacher caught the wheel of Kim Kirchen with 300m remaining, and fell. Since the finish was on an uphill climb, the rule giving anyone who crashes in the final 3 kilometers the same time as the group they were in upon crashing was not invoked, and he lost 32" on the stage, and Kirchen took the overall lead.
Stage 7.
This is a short stage along the steep roads of the Massif Central, through the Monts du Cantal with the third category Côte de Fraisse coming after only 11 km. After a fourth category climb came a pair of Category Two climbs: the Col d'Entremont after 101 km, and the Pas de Peyrol, before descending to Aurillac via another fourth category climb.
Early crosswinds split the peloton. Damiano Cunego crashed after about 50 km and although he rejoined the leading group, he missed a later break, losing 33 seconds on the day. A breakaway made up of Josep Jufré, Luis León Sánchez, David de la Fuente and Vincenzo Nibali formed on the way up the Col d'Entremont and were caught by a group of nineteen, including most of the overall favourites, with about 9 km remaining, but Sánchez counterattacked on the descent and held on to win the stage.
De la Fuente's three leads over the tops of climbs earned him the lead in the King of the Mountains classification, while four riders, including Agritubel team leader Christophe Moreau failed to finish and Magnus Bäckstedt finished outside regulation time.
Liquigas rider Manuel Beltrán was revealed after this stage to have failed a blood doping test earlier in the tour, and was withdrawn by his team.
Stage 8.
This was a connecting stage from the Massif Central to the Pyrenees and had four categorized climbs in the first half of the race before the finish in Toulouse.
The significant break of the day saw Laurent Lefevre go clear on the second climb, and was followed by his Bouygues Télécom teammate Jérôme Pineau, Amets Txurruka, and Christophe Riblon. Eventually Lefevre allowed the other three to join him, and the group attained a maximum advantage of 5' 15" at 110 km, but pressure from sprinters' teams reduced the gap rapidly over the following 20 km, to less than three minutes. Riccardo Riccò was one of four fallers at 116 km, and after being assisted to catch up with the peloton, needed medical attention. With 13 km to go, Pineau and Txurruka moved clear of their colleagues in the break, who were absorbed into the peloton 3 km later. The pursuit of the peloton, which had eased up to avoid regrouping too soon and allow other attacks, put on pressure again in the last 20 km, finally catching the two escapees with 3.5 km left. In a bunched sprint, Mark Cavendish gained his second stage victory.
Stage 9.
This stage took the riders into the Pyrenees with a series of fourth category climbs in the early stages before the third category Col des Ares at the 100 km mark. After passing through Bagnères-de-Luchon, the riders climbed the First Category Col de Peyresourde before the final climb over the Col d'Aspin, after which came a 26 km descent to the finish at Bagnères-de-Bigorre.
Aleksandr Kuschynski, Nicolas Jalabert, and Sebastian Lang formed a breakaway after 22 km that claimed the intermediate sprint and first few small climbs. They attained a maximum advantage of 14' 20" at 55 km before the peloton, being paced by Euskaltel-Euskadi, started bringing them back. Cadel Evans crashed after about 105 km, injuring his left elbow and needing to ride with torn clothing the rest of the stage. He had to change bikes and was paced back into the peloton by the rest of his Silence-Lotto team. He, and subsequently Alejandro Valverde, needed to seek medical attention.
The leaders' advantage, after staying at around ten minutes for many kilometers, began to fall on the ascent of the Col de Peyresourde, and first Jalabert, then Kuschynski, dropped off Lang's pace. Maxime Monfort and King of the Mountains leader David de la Fuente moved ahead of the peloton before the first major mountain pass of the tour.
After consolidating on the descent from the Peyresourde, the peloton thinned and split again on the way up the Col d'Aspin. The main GC contenders came to the front of the peloton as it neared the summit, and only Lang of the early escapees remained clear. After several other riders attempted unsuccessfully to do so, Luis León Sánchez bridged the gap to Monfort and de la Fuente, only for the latter to drop away. The decisive attack of the stage came from Riccardo Riccò, who rapidly passed the four riders ahead of the peloton and crossed the top of the Col d'Aspin 1' 15" ahead of the yellow jersey group he had left 4 km earlier.
Riccò preserved that margin on the descent to win the stage, with only Vladimir Efimkin moving clear of the peloton on the descent, to claim second position on the road. 
Stage 10.
This stage was selected for the 2008 L'Étape du Tour run on Sunday 6 July when nearly 7,500 amateur and club cyclists raced over the route, with Laurent Four coming home in the fastest time of 5 hours 38 minutes.
The highlight of this short, intense stage is the Hors Categorie climb over the Col du Tourmalet at 2115 m, with the finish at the ski-station at Hautacam. The final climb is 14.4 km, with an average gradient of 7.2%, with the steepest section at 10%.
Twenty-four riders representing seventeen teams broke away from the peloton almost immediately. Included in the group were three riders each for Gerolsteiner and Bouygues Télécom as well as the green and polka-dot jersey wearers Óscar Freire and David de la Fuente. Only Milram, Lampre, and Garmin-Chipotle were unrepresented. Freire took the first intermediate sprint and with it the outright lead in the points classification.
Seven of the twenty-four came clear on the way up the Côte de Loucrup. Freire was among them and took the second sprint to cement his lead. The leaders' time gap grew to over nine minutes before the peloton thinned as chases came forward to bring them back. Rémy Di Gregorio attacked and got free of the group of seven, going it alone to be the first over the Tourmalet.
Jens Voigt and Team CSC Saxo Bank set a blistering pace up the Tourmalet in the peloton, with the intention of knocking off as many teammates of the overall contenders as they could while protecting Carlos Sastre. Several team leaders, including Alejandro Valverde, eventually dropped as well. Di Gregorio at last was caught by the yellow jersey's group of contenders at the 12 kilometers to go mark. The contenders traded attacks on the way up to Hautacam, and the yellow jersey himself Kim Kirchen was dropped along the way. Fränk Schleck, Juan José Cobo, and Leonardo Piepoli came forward and gained a maximum advantage of two minutes on the other contenders. The Saunier Duval riders went on to drop Schleck, and the time gap between Schleck and Cadel Evans was very close to see who would wear yellow at the day's end.
Stage 11.
Stage 11 was a relatively straightforward ride through the foothills of the Pyrenees, with one first category climb over the Col de Portel at the 110 km mark, and two third category climbs.
Before the stage began, Moisés Dueñas was revealed to have failed a test for evidence of blood-doping at the end of stage 4, and was withdrawn by his team. Two more Barloworld riders withdrew injured during the stage, Félix Cárdenas and Paolo Longo Borghini. After 35 km, a 13-man breakaway, initiated by Fabian Wegmann and Kurt Asle Arvesen, formed, and with no rider within 20 minutes of the lead, came under no pressure from the main peloton. Gert Steegmans was dropped from this group on the first climb, but the rest of the breakaway increased their margin over the peloton. On the ascent of the Col de Portel, Amaël Moinard moved clear of the other escapees, and reached the top of the climb almost 2 minutes ahead of the rest of the group, while Óscar Pereiro moved ahead of the peloton, prompting a response by the CSC Saxo Bank team, and a split in the main field, but not isolating any GC contenders. Pereiro was re-integrated into the peloton with about 20 km remaining, while at the front of the race, Martin Elmiger and Arvesen attacked with 4 km left, shortly before Moinard was caught by the chasing group. They were joined by Alessandro Ballan, and briefly by Koos Moerenhout, and in the final 200m Arvesen started the sprint, hanging on to win the stage in a photo-finish. The main peloton, including all the main contenders, finished over 14 minutes behind, but leading standings were unaffected by the day's events.

Coaley School

Coaley C of E Primary School is a co-educational primary school for children aged between 4 and 11 years in the village of Coaley in Gloucestershire. 
History.
Though there was a school in existence in the village as early as 1839, the buildings on the current site were not constructed until 1864, when a suitable site was donated by Lord Fitzhardinge, a member of the Berkeley Family of Berkeley Castle to serve the village of Coaley and the surrounding area. The school's original trust deed states that 
"the said premises and all buildings thereon erected...to be forever...used as...a school for the education of children...of labouring, manufacturing and other poorer classes in the Parish of Coaley."
The original school building was extended in 1873, when a classroom was built at the rear to accommodate the infants, and this was further extended in 1898.
Organisation.
The school is a "Church of England (Controlled) Primary School", and as such reflects Christian practices and values, in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Deed. Whilst overall control is in the hands of the County Council, the Church retains the privilege of appointing certain Governors.
Performance.
In its 2005 inspection, Ofsted gave the school's a "good" rating and recognised that it provides "good value for money". The school was recognised as having "above average" standards in reading, writing, speaking and listening at Year 2 level and "above average" standards in English, mathematics and science in Year 6.
In 2008 the Ofsted inspection gave the school an overall "good" rating.
Facilities.
The original school was entirely housed in the Victorian school building which faces onto The Street in Coaley, and was supplemented with the addition of a temporary teaching block during the 1970s. In September 2002, an extension was added to the original Victorian building, providing two new classrooms, a Head Teacher's office and new toilet facilities. In 2009 a new library was added.
The School has a large playground and playing field bordered by a stream and nature area.

Tinok shenishba

Tinok shenishba (Hebrew: תינוק שנשבה, literally, "captured infant") is a Talmudical term that refers to a Jewish individual who sins inadvertently as a result of having been raised without an appreciation for the thought and practices of Judaism. Its status is widely applied in contemporary Orthodox Judaism to unaffiliated Jews today.
Terminology.
Tinok shenishba is short for "Tinok shenishba bein hanachrim", which translates as, "An infant captured consequently raised among gentiles." an individual doesn't literally have to have been "captured" as an infant to fall within the definition of a "tinok shenishba".
Application of "tinok shenishba" in Jewish law.
Because a tinok shenishba was not raised with proper guidance towards appreciation of Jewish life, law, and ritual, they are not accountable for not living in accordance with the Torah.
Codification in the Talmud.
Reference to the concept of "tinok shenishba" occurs in the Talmud. In Shavuos 5a, the Gemarah states that responsibility for inadvertent transgression is only placed upon an individual who knew the correct law at two points in time and forgot the law sometime in between. If that individual knew the law and subsequently forgot the law, and never again remembered or received a reminder, they would be an unwitting transgressor. Similarly, if an individual never knew the law in the first place, and subsequently learned the law, they would also be an unwitting transgressor. This latter example could fall under the category of a "tinok shenishba".
In Shabbat 68b, there is a dispute between Rav and Shmuel on one side and Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish on the other in regards to in what type of situations would a "tinok shenishba", along with a convert who was similarly raised among gentiles, be responsible for punishment and/or repentance along with the offering of animal sacrifices in the Holy Temple upon transgression of the laws of Shabbat. The halacha follows that a "tinok shenishba" would only be required to do one act of repentance for the many, many times they were in transgression because all their sins stemmed from a single instance of not knowing the proper laws to obey.
Practical relevance of "tinok shenishba" in the modern era.
Maimonides speaks out strongly against those who deny the validity of the Oral Torah, including the Mishna and the Talmud, labeling them as heretics. This would include Karaite Jews. He claims they deserve neither witnesses, warning, nor judges to be punished according to Jewish law. Rather, anyone who removes them from existence merits great reward as one who removed an obstacle from the proper course of Jewish belief and practice. 
However, Maimonides expresses concern for the offspring of such individuals, and excludes them from those who deserve such punishment because they participated unwittingly in their denial of Torah and mitzvos. While they are indeed sinners, he declares them unintentional participants in their lack of adherence to Jewish law and belief, similar to the case of a "tinok shenishba". Rather than be pushed away, such individuals are to be drawn into the Jewish community and taught the proper way so they can become observant, pious members of community.
The notion that unaffiliated and unobservant Jews are unwitting sinners who should be taught the Jewish laws and customs and welcomed into the Torah community is the basis for the many outreach organizations (Kiruv) that exist in the modern era, including Chabad, Aish Hatorah, Ohr Somayach and Gateways.
The common Jewish folk in Hasidic mysticism.
The Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760), founder of the revivalist Hasidic movement, brought a mystical soul-dimension to the traditional Talmudic notions of the Tinuk Shenishba, and the Am ha-aretz (uneducated-boorish-rustic Jews). While the former terms derive from the pre-eminent status of Torah study in Rabbinic Jewish culture, their downside was that in the 17-18th century Eastern Europe in which Hasidism emerged, their elitist notions contributed to the physical and spiritual hardship and dissenfranchisement of the common Jewish folk from deeper Jewish affiliation.
Adjusting the former hierarchy of values, the Baal Shem Tov taught that the simple, sincere common Jewish folk could be closer to God than the scholars, for whom pride may affect their scholarly achievements, and the elite scholars could envy and learn lessons in devotion from the uneducateded community. The Baal Shem Tov and later Hasidic masters made deveikut the central principle in Jewish spirituality, teaching that the sincere Divine soul essence of the artless Jew reflects the essential Divine simplicity. In contemporary Hasidic views of outreach to unobservant Jews, this mystical emphasis implies that the value of a small deed of observance by unaffiliated Jews would be able to set aside one's own spiritual development, as the Baal Shem Tov taught, "a soul may come into the World for 70 years in order to do a single deed of kindness to another person".

U.S. Route 6 in Indiana

U.S. Route 6 (US 6) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway that runs from California to Provincetown, Massachusetts. In Indiana, it is part of the Indiana State Road system that enters the state concurrent with the Borman Expressway between Lansing, Illinois, and Munster, Indiana. The of US 6 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some sections of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four-lane divided highways. The easternmost community along the highway is Butler at the Ohio state line.
US 6 passes through farm fields and forest lands, and along the northern part of Indiana. The highway is included in the Grand Army of the Republic Highway. US 6 was first designated as a US Highway in 1932. A section of the highway originally served as part of Sauk Indian Trail. US 6 replaced the original State Road 17 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana state road system. SR 17 ran from Ligonier through Kendallville to Waterloo and ended in Butler. US 6 also replaced the second designation of the highway, State Road 6, through most of the state.
Route description.
US 6 enters Indiana concurrent with I-80/I-94 on the Borman Expressway. US 6 is concurrent with I-80/I-94 until Lake Station where US 6 leaves the expressway. US 6 heads due south towards Hobart. In Hobart US 6 turns east towards Westville. On the way to Westville the road passes through an interchange with State Road 49 and an intersection with State Road 2. In Westville the route has a concurrency with U.S. Route 421. South of Westville US 421 heads south and US 6 heads east. The route heads towards Walkerton, passing through an intersection with State Road 39, a concurrency with U.S. Route 35, and an intersection with State Road 104. In Walkerton the road has a concurrency with State Road 23. From Walkerton the route heads east towards Bremen, passing through a traffic light with U.S. Route 31.
US 6 bypasses Bremen on the north side of town. At the western terminus of the Bremen bypass US 6 has an intersection with State Road 106. Then while on the bypass, the route has an intersection with a service road at connects with State Road 331, US 6 passes over SR 331. Then at the eastern terminus of the bypass US 6 has an intersection with the eastern terminus of SR 106. From Bremen the road heads east towards Nappanee. In Nappanee the route has a traffic light at State Road 19. From Nappanee the road heads east towards Ligonier, passing through an intersection with State Road 15, a concurrency with State Road 13, and a concurrency with US 33. The concurrency with US 33 end at a traffic light with State Road 5 in Ligonier. US 33 heads south and US 6 heads east towards Kendallville. On the to Kendallville the route has a concurrency with State Road 9. In Kendallville the road has a concurrency with State Road 3. The route heads east from Kendallville towards Waterloo. On the way to Waterloo the road has a concurrency with StateRoad 327 and an interchange with Interstate 69. The route enters Waterloo and has an intersection with State Road 427. From Waterloo the road heads east towards Butler. The road enters Butler and has an intersection with State Road 1. From Butler US 6 heads east toward Ohio state line.
Only the segment of US 6 that are concurrent with Interstate 80/Interstate 94 and the segment that is concurrent with U.S. Route 33 are included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 2,620 vehicles and 930 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between US 35 and Walkerton. The peak traffic volumes were 166,160 vehicles and 42,090 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US 6 that is concurrent with the I–80 and I–94.
History.
US 6 was established in the late 1700s as the old Sauk Indian Trail also known as the Great East-West Trail. In 1843 the road between Ligonier and Kendallville became a gravel road surface. The first number was State Road 17 in 1918, from Ligonier to the Ohio state line. The rest of what is now US 6 was unsigned. The name of the road was changed to the Chicago Road in the 1920, SR 17 was still in use on this road. In 1926 signs for State Road 6 were installed from the Illinois state line to Westville and from Ligonier to Ohio state line. US 6 signs were installed and the road was paved during the summer of 1932. The rest of the road from Westville to Ligonier was under construction during this year.
Northwest Indiana.
Before the route of US 6 was changed to the Borman Expressway, US 6 entered Indiana from Illinois on Ridge Road. US 6 headed east passing through Munster, Highland, and New Chicago. This route became Bus US 6 and now this route is unnumbered from Illinois to Indiana State Road 912 and is still BUS US 6 from SR 912 to US 6 in Hobart.

Francis VI de Beauharnais

Francis, marquis of Beauharnais (VI), (1756, La Rochelle - 1823) was a French nobleman. He was the son of Francis V of Beauharnais, baron de Beauville, marquis de La Ferté-Beauharnais, and of his wife Henriette Pyvart de Chastillé. This made him the elder brother of Alexandre de Beauharnais and the uncle of Napoleon's stepchildren Eugène and Hortense.
He represented the nobility of États Généraux of 1789, but later emigrated to join Condé's army as a major general. However, he later rallied to the First French Empire, which sent him on various diplomatic missions. Francis VI of Beauharnais was one of the great-grandfathers of the family Eslandoost de Beauville.
Marriages and issue.
On 1 May 1778 François de Beauharnais married Françoise de Beauharnais (1757–1822), daughter of Claude de Beauharnais, comte des Roches-Baritaud, and of Anne-Marie Mouchard. They divorced in 1793, after having 4 children:
In 1802, François de Beauharnais married Louise von Cohausen (1775–1822), daughter of Karl Caspar Hubertus, reichsritter von Cohausen, and of Elisabeth Umbscheiden von Ehrencron. They had 2 children:

2008 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 21

These are the profiles for the individual stages in the 2008 Tour de France, with Stage 12 on 17 July, and Stage 21 on 27 July.
Stages.
Stage 12.
This stage featured one fourth category climb over the Col du Camperié east of Axat after 111 km, before a long rapid descent to Narbonne, which was expected to give the sprinters the chance to demonstrate their skills. 
The day began with news of the withdrawal from the Tour of the Saunier Duval-Scott team after their leader Riccardo Riccò, who was top of both the King of the Mountains and Young Riders' categories, had failed a blood test taken at the end of Stage 4.
At the 40 kilometer mark, Samuel Dumoulin and Arnaud Gerard broke away, and attained a maximum advantage of 4 minutes. Juan José Oroz joined them at the 113 kilometer mark. The peloton didn't let them get very much of a lead, keeping the time gap at around a minute and a half for most of the race, until the catch occurred with about 9 kilometers to go. A bunched sprint saw Mark Cavendish win his third stage this tour.
Stage 13.
A series of fourth category climbs took the riders through Languedoc, before the run into Nîmes on this transitional stage before the riders move into the Alps.
This stage was remarkably similar to the one from the day before. An early breakaway, by Niki Terpstra and Florent Brard led almost the entire day until being caught in the final 10 kilometers. Another bunched sprint saw Mark Cavendish win yet again, but beyond that, eight of the top ten placed riders were the same both days, with three (including Cavendish) in the same exact position. Cavendish became the first sprinter to win four stages at a single Tour de France since Alessandro Petacchi did so in 2003, although Lance Armstrong won five of the last eight stages in the 2004 Tour de France including two individual time trials and three mountain stages.
Stage 14.
The race approached the Alps through the Vaucluse department crossing two fourth category climbs before dropping down to Digne-les-Bains.
A break of 21 riders, with representatives from all but three of the teams, moved away after 5 km. Only four riders remained clear by the 41st kilometer; Bram Tankink, Sandy Casar, William Bonnet and Jose Ivan Gutierrez. They were eventually caught on the last climb, and on the descent there were many splits in the field. Of many attempted breaks on the descent towards the finish, Sylvain Chavanel came closest to success, but the stage again finished in a sprint. Cavendish had been dropped from the peloton on the climb, and points classification leader Óscar Freire won the sprint.
Stage 15.
The 15th stage was due to start at Digne-les-Bains but due to the risk of rock falls in the climb up the Col de Larche, the organisers decided to modify the itinerary. The stage started instead from Embrun and headed to Prato Nevoso, crossing into Italy via the climb over the Hors Categorie Col Agnel (2,744 m). The finish at Prato Nevoso is rated First Category with a 11.4 km climb at an average of 6.9%.
The road conditions at the start in Embrun were terrible, with consistent rain soaking the road. After several attempts earlier, Egoi Martínez, José Luis Arrieta, Danny Pate, and Simon Gerrans broke away from the peloton at the 12 kilometer mark, just before the first intermediate sprint. The peloton was content to let them go up the Col Agnel well ahead, as their maximum advantage was almost fourteen minutes before the summit. When the peloton's relatively lax pace finally quickened, the autobus formed in back of it on the way up the Col Agnel. Martinez was the first over the top.
The peloton consolidated on the descent, but for an unusual reason - Robert Hunter and Óscar Pereiro clipped wheels and crashed, with Pereiro dramatically tumbling through a barricade from one section of the road down to a lower section. This happened at the front of the main group, and afterwards for several kilometers the peloton slowed nearly to the pace they'd had in the rain-soaked neutral zone. The time gap to the four leaders rose from eleven and a half to over seventeen minutes in this time. Pereiro broke his arm in the crash, and had to abandon. The field similarly slowed, affording more time to the breakaway, after a crash (which involved Christian Vande Velde, Damiano Cunego, Vincenzo Nibali, Sebastian Lang, and others) on both sides of a roundabout at the 60 kilometers to go mark. At that point, it was calculated that the peloton had no chance to catch the break, so the peloton stayed together, with the contenders poising to attack on the climb up to Prato Nevoso.
Team CSC Saxo Bank set a blistering pace on the way up the Colle del Morte and again up to Prato Nevoso, splitting the field and trying to isolate Cadel Evans. The yellow jersey group thinned to ten riders, including the top six in the GC, as the CSC domestiques dropped off. On the way up to Prato Nevoso, Martinez attacked the other leaders and Arrieta was dropped. The favorites traded attacks and split as well on the way up.
Gerrans won the sprint to the line. Bernhard Kohl, Carlos Sastre, Denis Menchov and Alejandro Valverde came clear of Evans' group on the way to the finish. Fränk Schleck came clear of Evans in the last 100m to claim the yellow jersey, with Kohl narrowly failing to have taken enough time out of them both.
Stage 16.
The race returned to France on this short stage, via the Hors Categorie Col de la Lombarde and Col de la Bonette (the highest pass in Europe at over 2,800 m altitude), before a descent of more than 20 km.
Five riders, Samuel Dumoulin, Christophe Le Mével, Sebastien Rosseler, and former classification leaders Stefan Schumacher and Thomas Voeckler came clear of the peloton after 42 kilometers. Twenty-four riders also came clear as a chase shortly thereafter, splitting the field well before the climb up the Col de la Lombarde began. Riders were dropped and attacked from the various groups and the field split into numerous fragments, until Schumacher was the only leader left. He stayed well clear of the trailing groups and actually gained time to be the first over the Lombarde. The others from the breakaway, aside from Schumacher, were eventually absorbed by the chases.
The field split even more on the way up the Col de la Bonette, to the point where it was difficult to call any particular group the peloton. Christian Vande Velde was the first GC contender to be dropped from the yellow jersey group, cracked by the pacemaking being done by Andy Schleck. A chase group paced by Cyril Dessel and Yaroslav Popovych caught Schumacher some 3 kilometers before the summit of the Bonette. John-Lee Augustyn, attacked from this group shortly before the summit and was the first to reach the top. He later skidded off the road and tumbled down a steep decline on the dirt beside it, losing his bike. He had no choice but to wait for a service car with a spare machine, and thus lost the chance to rejoin the leading group.
The leading group was whittled to four on the descent - Popovych, Dessel, David Arroyo and Sandy Casar. Denis Menchov was dropped from the yellow jersey group early on in the descent, and lost time. This brought Cadel Evans forward to make the pace in the yellow jersey group, to put as much time as possible between them and Menchov, since Menchov was likely Evans' biggest threat in the individual time trial that was to come and thus in all likelihood, for the Tour title itself. Popovych tried to open the sprint at just over 1 kilometer to go, but the others got him back. Dessel eventually took down the run to the line.
Stage 17.
This was the last stage before the race left the Alps, with three Hors Categorie climbs of the Col du Galibier (2,645 m.), the Col de la Croix de Fer (2,067 m.) and the final climb up the Alpe d'Huez (1,850 m.).
At the very beginning of the day's racing a breakaway started, with Rémy Di Gregorio, Rubén Pérez and Peter Velits, joined later by Stefan Schumacher. With three major cols, the field inevitably became very fractured, but this group stayed clear of the main contenders for much of the day, with Schumacher first over the Galibier, and Velits taking the Croix de Fer. By the base of the Alpe d'Huez, only Velits and Jérôme Pineau were in front of the elite riders, whose group then numbered about 12. At the bottom of this final ascent of the day Carlos Sastre attacked twice, tagged by Menchov on the 1st go before eventually breaking clear. His fellow Team CSC Saxo Bank members in the group, Andy and Fränk Schleck worked to interrupt any counterattacks on the way up to Alpe d'Huez, and Sastre finished two minutes clear to claim yellow from the older Schleck brother, and establish a lead that he might be able to sustain in the time trial to follow.
Stage 18.
The race left the Alps and headed towards central France, with three rated climbs, including the second category Croix de Montvieux (811 m.) at 33 km from the finish.
At 30 kilometers in, Alexandre Botcharov and Damiano Cunego crashed, with Cunego falling face-first into a road obstruction. He lay on the road for seven minutes before remounting his bike, falling ten minutes behind the peloton, with four teammates remaining with him for the rest of the stage. After 68 km, Carlos Barredo made a break, prompting a reaction from Marcus Burghardt and Christophe Le Mével. After 81 km, Burghardt caught up with Barredo, meanwhile, Mikel Astarloza and Romain Feillu joined Le Mével, about four minutes behind the leaders. These time gaps held up to the start of the Croix de Montvieux, at which point the breakaway appeared uncatchable.
The four main groups on the road continued up the final climb with time gaps remaining relatively unchanged. Barredo and Burghardt traded several attacks to the top of this climb and after it but Burghardt won a late, tense dash to the line. Feillu lead the next group home for third place, while an attack by Roman Kreuziger, an attempt to gain time on young rider classification leader Andy Schleck, resulted in a group of five riders including both Schleck and Kreuziger finishing some 20 seconds in front of the peloton. Cunego and his team-mates finished last, with Cunego dropping six places to twentieth in the general classification.
Stage 19.
After two rated climbs in the first 42 km, this was an undulating route through the Allier department.
A four man group, made up of Stefan Schumacher, Egoi Martínez, Alessandro Ballan and Pierrick Fédrigo, moved away from the peloton after 16 km and led over the climbs, but never got more than 1'05" clear, and by 69 km the group had been caught. Nine km later, Sylvain Chavanel made an attack, and Jérémy Roy bridged the gap to join him. This pair stayed clear for the rest of the stage, with Chavanel thereby becoming the rider to have spent the greatest distance in this tour as part of a breakaway. The group's maximum advantage of over five minutes was reduced to a little over one by the end of the stage, in which Chavanel held off Roy's sprint to win. The bunched sprint for the minor positions was won by the tour's youngest rider, Gerald Ciolek, but green jersey leader Óscar Freire gained enough points to all but ensure victory in that competition. All the main contenders for Tour victory remained in the peloton all day.
Stage 20.
The second and final individual time trial followed rolling roads in the Allier and Cher departments.
Despite the work he had done for his team in the Alps, two-time world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara had the legs to set the first true time to beat, nearly two minutes clear of early leader Sebastian Lang at the intermediate time checks and the finish. Stefan Schumacher, winner of the first time trial in the Tour, exactly tied Cancellara at the first time check and caught Sylwester Szmyd, who started two minutes before him, after only 18 kilometers. He came 14 seconds clear of Cancellara at the third time check and finished 21 seconds better than the world champion at the line.
Roman Kreuziger took back over a minute from Andy Schleck in the race for the white jersey over the first two time checks, but missed winning the jersey at the end. Fränk Schleck seemed to be in poor form, losing considerable time as well as four places. Cadel Evans was unable to gain the time he needed on Carlos Sastre to regain yellow. Bernhard Kohl rode an unexpectedly good time trial, gaining slightly on Sastre and riding almost identically to Evans at the first two time checks, despite having fallen off the starthouse ramp before his ride began. Sastre was consistent and strong, riding one of his best ever time trials, catching Fränk Schleck and riding well enough to keep his yellow jersey for the ride to Paris.
Stage 21.
This was a hilly course to Paris winding through the Chevreuse Valley before the traditional loop on the Champs-Élysées, Place de la Concorde and the Rue de Rivoli. Once again, the strong men among the remaining sprinters fought it out for this prestigious stage win.
In keeping with tradition, the peloton took it easy on the way to the Champs-Élysées, with many riders taking time to smile for the cameras and enjoy some champagne courtesy of the team car of the victorious Team CSC Saxo Bank. Atop bicycles with new yellow handlebars, Team CSC led the field onto Champs-Élysées for the eight circuits over the famous cobblestone way. Beginning at the end of the first circuit, numerous riders tried to break away from the field, but none succeeded, and a classic bunched sprint saw Gert Steegmans win the race to the line. The field split in this final sprint, resulting in shifts of a few seconds in the final general classification.

Uhrenindustriemuseum

The Uhrenindustriemuseum (Museum of Clock Making Technology) is located in the town of Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany, and is a museum dedicated not as much to clocks and watches as to the history of the clockmaking industry of the town. Schwenningen was for much of the 19th century (and the early 20th century) one of southern Germany's most important centers of industrial scale clock manufacturing.
The museum is located at Bürkstraße 39, a building that was built to house the manufacturing plant for clocks by Wũrttenbergische Uhrenfabrik Bũrk Söhne. That company was considered to be the world leader in the specialised field of portable watchmen's control clocks and related time-recording devices. 
The core of the museum's collection is made up of working production machinery used to make precision metal parts that can be assembled into clock movements. Actually they have "all" the machinery in-house to produce all components (except for the mainspring) to manufacture a simple alarm clock movement. Staffing permitting the full museum visit will include a demonstration of the lathes, milling machines and punch presses, as well as the assembly and packaging process.
Additionally there is a comprehensive display of locally mass-produced clocks from most of the former clock factories of Schwenningen. Furthermore there are temporary exhibits.

Jinmaku

A is a curtain used in setting up a military encampment commonly seen from the pre-modern era in Japan. The jinmaku were also historically known as a , or "military curtain".
Origin.
Jinmaku literally means "camp curtain". In the Japanese the word is formed from two kanji. The first, , means "military camp" and the second, means "curtain".
Early use.
In ancient Japan jinmaku were tied to poles and stretched around an field encampments to form a defensive barrier. References to its use as early in the Nara period (710–794) are found in the Konjaku Monogatarishū, a Japanese collection of over one thousand tales written during the late Heian period (794–1185). Soldiers in the Konjaku Monogatarishū slept in an area surrounded by jinmaku to provide protection while sleeping. Jinmaku were typically constructed of hemp cloth. Illustrations on the Mongol invasion in the Zenkunen kassen emaki depict the appearance of clan "mon" emblems on jinmaku in the 13th century. The style and construction of jinmaku were standardized in the Muromachi period (1336–1573).
Edo period.
The Honchō Gunki Kō, a military manual written early in the early 17th century by Arai Hakuseki (1657–1725), lays out standard measurements for jinmaku. Arai, an advisor to the shogun Tokugawa Ienobu, recorded that a jinmaku should be tall and wide. The number of , or poles for hanging the jinmaku, was set at 10 for a "taisho" officer and 8 for other soldiers, tethers only in white, black, or blue, and "mon" clan emblems placed in between three, five, or seven places. In the Edo period military science became popular among samurai and gave religious meaning to jinmaku as a sacred item.
Modern use.
Jinmaku are used in festivals and theaters, especially for open-air performances. Traditionally the jinmaku is thought to have the power to drive evil away from the stage.

Jinmaku can be constructed for recreational or historical reenactment using modern materials. The following sites include basic directions.

Ship John Shoal Light

The Ship John Shoal Light marks the north side of the ship channel in Delaware Bay on the east coast of the United States, near the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge. Its cast iron superstructure was exhibited at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
History.
Ship John Shoal took its name from an incident in 1797 in which the "John", captained by a Robert Folger, ran aground while on the way from Hamburg, Germany to Philadelphia. Passengers and cargo were unloaded safely, but the vessel was lost. (The figurehead is on exhibit in the Gibbon House Museum in Greenwich, New Jersey, the town to which the rescued passengers were taken.)
Completion of the original Brandywine Shoal Light in 1850 led the Lighthouse Board to draw up plans to erect similar lights at Ship John Shoal and Cross Ledge. Both of these were intended to be of the then-new screw-pile design. During construction of the Cross Ledge Light in the winter of 1856, however, ice carried away the entire structure, prompting reconsideration of the suitability of this type of foundation. In the 1870s caisson foundations became available, and in 1873 Congress appropriated funds toward the construction of a caisson light on the shoal. Wooden piles were driven and the caisson placed in 1874; however, insufficient time remained in the working season to complete the light, and a temporary structure was placed to allow display of a light from November of that year.
The incomplete structure managed to withstand the winter ice, but in January the keepers abandoned their temporary refuge out of fear that it would be overturned. They were able to return in March, but by then, the permanent superstructure had been diverted to the Southwest Ledge Light in Connecticut. An identical cast iron house was fabricated, but it was diverted to Philadelphia for display at the Centennial Exhibition, where it was even occupied by a keeper tending a working light in its lantern. The house did not reach the caisson until the summer of 1877; in the meantime, a lightship was stationed alongside the unfinished structure. The base had also been surrounded with 2,000 tons of riprap to ward off ice damage.
In 1907 additional riprap was dumped around the light, and about the same time a concrete platform was built on one of the two piles of rock in order to hold tanks for which there was no room in the light itself. In 1973 the light was automated, and four years later the original Fresnel lens was removed and replaced by a solar powered beacon, whose solar panels stand on the platform where the tanks once rested.
In June 2011, the General Services Administration made the Ship John Shoal Light (along with 11 others) available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them.

Rick Blubaugh

Rick Brian Blubaugh (born December 28, 1964, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri) is an American former professional soccer player. He spent four seasons in the Western Soccer Alliance, one in the Major Indoor Soccer League and one in the Continental Indoor Soccer League.
Youth.
Blubaugh's roots are traced to Lynnwood, Washington, son of Joe and Selva Blubaugh. In 1981 and 1982, he was a starting defender for the boys U-17 ½ and U-18 ½ Washington state select soccer team. In 1981, Blubaugh, along with Washington teammates Geoff Wall and Chance Fry, was tapped to represent the West regional soccer team in a national tournament held at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The West region team, which comprised future stars Ralph Black, Dale Ervine and Paul Caligiuri, reigned supreme winning the event by vanquishing the East, South and Midwest regions. Upon conclusion of the tournament, Blubaugh was selected as an alternate for the United States Youth National Team.
High school.
Blubaugh attended Meadowdale High School in Lynnwood, Washington (1981–1983) where he started three consecutive years as a midfielder for the erstwhile named Chiefs. In 1982 and 1983, he served as Meadowdale’s team captain and garnered first team All Western Conference (WesCo) soccer honors.
College.
Blubaugh was a freshman starting defender anchoring a talent-laden and nationally ranked San Diego State University Aztecs men’s soccer team, coached by Chuck Clegg (1984–1985). He returned to Seattle, Washington the following year and capped off his collegiate career as a three year starting defender for the nationally ranked University of Washington Huskies men’s soccer team, coached by Ron Carter (1985–1987). During his tenure at Washington, he was named to the All Northwest Collegiate Conference Team in 1986 (2nd team) and in 1987 (1st team). In his sophomore and senior seasons, he was instrumental in leading the Huskies to two Northwest Collegiate Soccer Conference titles (1985,1987). In 1988, Blubaugh graduated from the University of Washington earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology.
F.C. Seattle.
In the summer of 1984, as a 19-year-old, Blubaugh assumed duties as a defender for Football Club Seattle which hosted the F.C. Seattle Challenge. This series featured F.C. Seattle squaring off against three North American Soccer League (NASL) powerhouse teams (Vancouver Whitecaps, Minnesota Strikers, New York Cosmos) as well as the men’s United States Olympic Team. F.C. Seattle’s roster boasted select high school, college and professional players. The team was coached by former Seattle Sounders luminaries Jimmy Gabriel, Tommy Jenkins, Pepe Fernandez and Jack Brand and played its games in Seattle’s Memorial Stadium. These four contests had a favorable following with the average attendance eclipsing the 6,000 barrier. Also, Blubaugh challenged, guided and encouraged the development of young minds through soccer with former F.C. Seattle Storm teammates Peter Fewing, John Hamel, Craig Beeson, Eddie Henderson and Jeff Koch spanning the state of Washington at Peter Fewing Soccer Camps (1985–1996).
Western Soccer Alliance.
Blubaugh was a starting defender for the F.C. Seattle Storm (1986–1989), again with former Seattle Sounder Tommy Jenkins at the helm, of the newly minted Western Soccer Alliance. The Storm enjoyed a successful campaign overseas in the 1987 "Great Britain Tour", locking horns with elite English clubs Middlesbrough F.C., A.F.C. Bournemouth, Portsmouth F.C. and Queen's Park Rangers F.C., not to mention perennial Scottish power, Dundee F.C.. 1988 witnessed the Storm secure the top spot in the Western Soccer Alliance regular season standings and, at once, march their way through the playoffs summarily disposing of a talent-laden San Jose Earthquakes team in the final 5-0, deservedly crowning them Western Soccer Alliance Champions.

Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)

Krzysztof Krawczyk (born September 8, 1946 in Katowice) is a Polish pop singer having a baritone voice, a guitarist and composer. He was the vocalist of a popular Polish band, Trubadurzy (English translation: Troubadours), from 1963 to 1973 when he started his solo career. He was co-founder of the Post-secondary School of Stage Art in Łódź. His creative activity in the area of music is characterized by a combination of various music genres such as rock and roll, country music and rhythm & blues. His album "To co w życiu ważne" reached number one on the Polish Music Charts.
Biography.
Krawczyk learned to play the guitar on his own, whereas his vocal abilities were practised when he attended secondary school of music in Łódź. However, he had to quit his musical studies and become an errand-boy, because his father, an actor, died and his mother suffered from depression. He was the only member of the family to earn a living.
In 1963 he founded, together with Ryszard Poznakowski, Marian Lichtman, Sławomir Kowalewski and Halina Żytkowiak, one of the best known Polish beat music bands of the 1960s, Trubadurzy, who combined elements of rock with Polish folk music.
Solo career.
Ten years after that band's establishment, Krawczyk started his solo career. In the 1970s he recorded several successful songs such as "Parostatek" ("The steamship"), "Pokochaj moje marzenia" ("Love my dreams"), "Pamiętam Ciebie z tamtych lat" ("I remember you from those years") or "Ostatni raz zatańczysz ze mną" ("You'll dance with me that last time"). He had numerous performances at festivals in Opole, Sopot and Kołobrzeg. He also toured in all the countries of the Warsaw Pact as well as in Sweden, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland. His work of the 1970s was considered to be kitsch by some critics. Nevertheless, his songs of that time have been genuinely popular to this day.
He collaborated with a famous cabaret performer, Bohdan Smoleń. They released several humoristic songs around 1985, e.g. "Mężczyzna po czterdziestce" ("The man in his forties") and "Dziewczyny, które mam na myśli" that borrowed melodies from Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias' "To all the girls I loved before" (1984). All these songs were very different from what he had performed before.
In 1981 Krawczyk moved to the U.S. to perform and to record an album in Indianapolis for TRC Records. The 1982 LP, "From a Different Place", was distributed nationally; a single, "Solidarity", received heavy airplay in several cities, especially Chicago. John Cascella, later to become John Mellencamp's keyboardist, composed many of the songs on the album, which was produced by Gary Schatzlein. For U.S. audiences, Krawczyk's name was shortened and Anglicized to "Krystof".
While in the U.S., Krawczyk's wife Ewa helped him overcome addictions to alcohol and drugs. After a return to Poland in the mid 1980s, he underwent tonsil surgery and spent one year living in Kolobrzeg to recover his voice. In 1988, he was driving his family and fell asleep behind the wheel. As a result, he suffered numerous injuries that required long months of therapy.
In the 1990s, he was in the US again. He returned to Poland in 1994. When he encountered lack of interest from esteemed music producers, he got involved in the disco polo business. He later admitted that this decision helped him to survive the "hard times", because the albums he made at that time were very successful. However, this did not protect him against constant criticism. In the late 1990s Krawczyk changed his image from a "discotheque playboy" to a mature middle-aged artist who propagated family values. In this way, he successfully came back on stage with such hits like "Jestem sobą" ("I'm myself"), "Wiarygodny" ("The credible") or "Bo jesteś Ty" ("Because you are"). He has sung with other artists, such as Andrzej Piaseczny, Edyta Bartosiewicz, Muniek Staszczyk, Goran Bregović and Rod Stewart.
In 2000, Krzysztof Krawczyk performed for Pope John Paul II in Saint Peter's Square in Vatican City.
Personal life.
He has been married three times. His first wife was Grażyna Adamus, whom he knew from school, but that marriage lasted only a short time. He has a grown-up son with his second wife, Halina Żytkowiak. At present, Krawczyk lives in a small village of Grotniki near Łódź with his third wife, Ewa, as well as their three daughters whom they adopted.

High Bridge (Coatesville, Pennsylvania)

The Coatesville High Bridge is a stone masonry arch railroad viaduct that crosses the valley of the West Branch Brandywine Creek at Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Built by the Pennsylvania Railroad between 1902 and 1904, it has ten arches (eight of and two of ) and spans a total length of , with wing walls extending it to . high, the bridge was built to accommodate four standard gauge railroad tracks, with a total length of .
The Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line passes along the north side of Coatesville on the southern slope of the North Valley Hills. The bridge carries the Main Line across the water gap cut by the Brandywine, as well as the former Wilmington and Northern Branch of the Reading Railroad and Pennsylvania Route 82.
Precursors.
The first bridge at the site was built by the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad in 1832. It was a single-track wood span on stone piers. The bridge was widened to double-track in 1854. This bridge was replaced by a cast iron bridge in 1867, and that in turn by a wrought iron Pratt truss in 1890. By around the start of the 20th century, however, the double-track bridge was proving to be a bottleneck in the quadruple-track main line on both sides, and plans were made for a bridge that would carry four tracks across the Brandywine Valley.
Construction and history.
While the PRR had been using steel bridges since the 1880s, and was constructing others nearby at the time, such as the High Bridge at Downingtown, President A. J. Cassatt decided in favor of a stone bridge at this location and elsewhere. This reflected the influence of PRR Chief Engineer William H. Brown, who rebuilt many of the railroad's bridges in masonry during his tenure. While more expensive than steel, Brown felt that stone bridges were stronger and more durable, and less expensive to maintain in the long term.
Work on the bridge began in November 1902, locating it slightly to the south of the double-track bridge. The bridge was completed on 1 September 1904 and the main line was realigned to cross it, abandoning the old bridge. The realignment reduced the curvature in the area and completed the PRR's four-track main line from Philadelphia to the Conestoga River bridge near Lancaster.
In later years, a concrete parapet was added to the bridge and the tops of some arches were reinforced with concrete. Catenary poles were added to the bridge with electrification in the 1930s. Ownership of the bridge passed, with the rest of the Main Line, to Penn Central in 1968 and Amtrak in 1976.

Blue Willow

Blue Willow is a realistic children's fiction book by Doris Gates, published in 1940. Called the "juvenile Grapes of Wrath", it was named a Newbery Honor book in 1941. Written by a librarian who worked with migrant children in Fresno, California, this story of a migrant girl who longs for a permanent home was considered groundbreaking in its portrayal of contemporary working-class life in America.
Plot.
Janey Larkin is the ten-year-old daughter of a migrant family in San Joaquin Valley, California, in the late 1930s when America is still suffering the effects of the Great Depression. Her most treasured possession is a Blue Willow plate that had once belonged to her great-great-grandmother. The picture of a bridge and a stream and a little house on the willow pattern plate represents the permanent home she dreams of.
Janey can barely remember her old home, a farm in Texas, and now that her father is an itinerant worker she has no place to call her own and no lasting friends, as the family has to move constantly. Despite the grinding poverty, the family is close and loving, and fun is had, as when Janey and her friend Lupe attend the county fair, and when the family goes fishing beside the river.
When Janey's stepmother falls sick, they have difficulty paying the rent. The rent-collector, Bounce Reyburn, is unsympathetic, and Janey is faced with having to sacrifice her one treasure.
Symbolism.
Janey's blue willow plate is her one prized possession. It belonged to her great-great-grandmother, and reminds Janey of her birth mother, who died so long ago Janey can hardly remember her. The fragile plate holds both her past and her future. To Janey the plate symbolizes the home she had before they lost their land and became migrant farmers. The plate represents Janey's hope for a better life and a real home. When Janey, somewhat nervously, shows it to Lupe and her friend understands how important and beautiful it is to Janey, the girl's friendship is solidified.
Significance.
"Blue Willow" has been called "the first social- or realistic-problem novel for children". It was well received but not without criticism for its topic. The character of Janey Larkin became a symbol for proponents of realistic fiction for children. At the time of the book's publication there was a debate about whether children's literature should be imaginative or realistic. In fact, though, "Blue Willow" combines realism and imagination. The setting is almost brutally realistic, but Janey's devotion to the plate and the home it represents depends upon her ability to look beyond her circumstances and believe in a dream. "Blue Willow" was seen to have the literary quality and positive values sought by librarians and educators as well as appealing to children. It was considered a breakthrough book for its contemporary working-class setting and for the rounded portrayal of Janey's Mexican-American friend, Lupe Romero, and her family. Because of the success of "Blue Willow" there was an "expansion of the range of subjects which could be explored in books for children."
Many writers of the realist school preferred setting their books in foreign countries or in the past, possibly to avoid any suggestion of leftist propaganda. In "Horn Book" magazine Howard Pease's essay "Without Evasion" mentions Doris Gates as one of the rare exceptions: "Only at infrequent intervals do you find a story intimately related to this modern world, a story that takes up a modern problem and thinks it through without evasion. Of our thousands of books, I can find scarcely half a dozen that merit places on this almost vacant shelf in our libraries; and of our hundreds of authors, I can name only three who are doing anything to fill this void in children's reading. These three authors - may someone present each of them with a laurel wreath - are Doris Gates, John R. Tunis, and Florence Crannell Means."
The "Blue Willow" manuscript is held in the May Massee Collection at Emporia State University.
Awards and reception.
"Blue Willow" was a Newbery Honor book, won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1961, and was named one of the Best Books of the Year by Horn Book Magazine; It also won the silver Commonwealth Club of California Book Award. It has continued to be well received. "Choosing Books for Kids" says of it, "Family life in the thirties in a poignant story that has outlasted the era it tells about." Children's literature expert May Hill Arbuthnot calls "Blue Willow" "a tender and beautifully written book". Another reviewer wrote "One sees in "Blue Willow" a perfect combination of realistic depiction of setting, careful study of character, and the structural patterns of romance, the linear journey to fulfillment. The book is Gates's major literary achievement and an important contribution to American children's literature."

Two years later, Hera released her second independently produced album "Not So Sweet" and her career started to take off after a track from it, "Itchy Palms", was chosen as the title track for the award winning Icelandic film "Hafið" ("The Sea"). The song resulted in her being nominated for two awards at the 2002 Icelandic Music Awards. She won for 'Best Female Singer', a category that had only ever been won by Björk or Emilíana Torrini in the ten year history of the awards.
Her song "Makebelieve" from her third album "Not Your Type!" was a finalist in the 2002 USA Songwriting Competition, and became the third most played song on Icelandic National Radio in 2003. Her third and subsequent studio albums have been released on Icelandic record label Sena.
The year 2003 saw the release of her fourth studio album (and first Icelandic language recording) "Hafið þennan dag". Since that time she has toured Iceland and Europe extensively and has opened for artists such as Nick Cave and Joe Cocker.
Her fifth album "Don't Play This" was released in 2005 and the same year, she played at the Glastonbury Music Festival. In 2007, she played her first gigs in the United States including a performance at SXSW in Austin, Texas.
Hera released her first live album in 2008 titled "Live at AL's", recorded on 16 May 2008 at Christchurch music venue Al's Bar.

Wilds Preston Richardson (Hunt County, Texas, 20 March 1861– 20 May 1929) was an officer of the United States Army notable for being an explorer and geographer of Alaska in the early decades of the 20th century. During World War I he was promoted to the rank brigadier general and, because of his cold weather experience, sent to lead the Polar Bear Expedition, part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Richardson retired after the war and died in Washington, D.C. in 1929.
Biography.
Richardson was born on 20 March 1861 to Oliver P. and Hester F. (Wingo) Richardson in Hunt County, Texas. After attending schools in that county, the younger Richardson received an appointment to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1880. After graduation in 1884, Richardson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 8th Cavalry Regiment, serving in California and other western posts. Richardson was promoted to first lieutenant in 1889, and joined the faculty at West Point three years later.
In 1897, Richardson was sent to Alaska to begin what would be a twenty-year stay. Initially in charge of scouting locations and supervising construction of military installations, in 1905 Richardson was appointed head of the War Department's Alaska Road Commission, which oversaw federal road construction projects in the territory. His major project was the completion of a road from Valdez to Fairbanks, later named the Richardson Highway in his honor.
After the entry of the United States into World War I, Richardson—promoted to brigadier general in August 1917—was assigned to command the 78th Infantry Brigade of the 39th Infantry Division at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, in March 1918. Arriving at Brest, France, on 3 September 1918, Richardson's unit participated in the closing stages of the war. After the Armistice, General John J. Pershing assigned Richardson—because of his Alaskan cold-weather experience—to the Polar Bear Expedition in Murmansk. Returning to the U.S. in October 1919, Richardson reverted to the rank of colonel and retired the following October.
Richardson lived the remainder of his years at the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C.; he died at Walter Reed Hospital on 20 May 1929 and was buried at West Point.
Legacy.
The U.S. Army post established near Anchorage, Alaska, in 1940 was named Fort Richardson in his honor. The Valdez-Fairbanks Trail, surveyed under his supervision in 1904, was named the Richardson Trail to honor him. In World War II, the U.S. Navy transport ship was named in his honor.

Robert Mylne (mason)

Robert Mylne (1633 – 10 December 1710) was a Scottish stonemason and architect. A descendant of the Mylne family of masons and builders, Robert was the last Master Mason to the Crown of Scotland, a post he held from 1668 until his death.
Biography.
Robert was a member of the Mylne family of masons and architects. His grandfather, John Mylne (died 1657), served as Master Mason to the Crown from 1631 to 1636, when he resigned in favour of his eldest son, also named John Mylne (1611–1667). His second son, Alexander Mylne (1613–1643), was an architectural sculptor, who carved statues for Parliament House. Robert was the son of Alexander Mylne, and served his apprenticeship with his childless uncle John.
After his apprenticeship, Mylne undertook his first known building project at John Wood's Hospital, Upper Largo, Fife, in 1665. In 1668 he was engaged to build a new mercat cross at Perth, to replace one destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's army in 1652. After his uncle's death, he completed Leslie House, for the Earl of Rothes, and extended Wemyss Castle for the Earl of Wemyss. He also worked at Drumlanrig Castle, for the Earl of Queensberry. As Royal master mason, Mylne was responsible for works to the Royal castles, and repaired Edinburgh Castle in 1662, 1677, and 1685. The Mylne Battery at the castle was named after him.
In 1671, work began on Holyrood Palace, on the orders of King Charles II. Sir William Bruce prepared the Palladian design, although Mylne drew up the plans, and was appointed master mason and contractor in charge of the works. His name appears on a pillar in the north-west corner of the internal courtyard. Simultaneously, Mylne was working under Bruce at Thirlestane Castle, home of the Duke of Lauderdale, who, as Secretary of State for Scotland, was also overseeing the work at Holyrood. Also for Lauderdale, Mylne built gate piers, to Bruce's design, for the Duke's English home, Ham House in Surrey.
Between 1674 and 1681, again working to Bruce's designs, Mylne constructed a series of cisterns in Edinburgh, as part of a new drinking water supply to the capital. 1678 saw Mylne's first speculative building project. He bought a block of land on the Shore at Leith, the port of Edinburgh, and constructed ten dwellings. In 1684–86, he built a larger development, Mylne's Square, opposite the Tron Kirk in the heart of Edinburgh. This square was the first home of the Bank of Scotland when it was founded in 1695, although the square was demolished in the 19th century to make way for the widened North Bridge. This was followed, in 1690, by Milne's Court, further up the Royal Mile, now occupied by student accommodation. Mylne also built numerous tenement blocks for others. The profits of these projects allowed him to purchase the estates of Balfargie in Fife, and Inveresk, east of Edinburgh, where he died aged 77. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, under the monument which he erected to his uncle.
Robert Mylne had eight sons and six daughters by his wife, Elizabeth Meikle, whom he had married in 1661. His eldest daughter Janet married the architect James Smith, who had worked for Mylne at Holyrood. His eldest son William (1662–1728) continued the Mylne family business of building, and his great-grandson Robert Mylne (1733–1811) became an architect and engineer in London.

Peniel Missionary Society

The Peniel Mission was an interdenominational holiness missionary organisation that was started in Los Angeles, California in 1895 by Theodore Pollock Ferguson (1853–1920) and Manie Payne Ferguson (1850–1932) as an outgrowth of their Peniel Mission. It was merged with the World Gospel Mission in 1957.
History of the Peniel Missionary Society.
In addition to the expansion of the Peniel Mission in the United States of America, and its overseas territories: Alaska and Hawaii, eventually Peniel Missions were established overseas in Africa, Bolivia (1911); China (1909)[http://ricci.rt.usfca.edu/institution/view.aspx?institutionID=567]; Egypt, Guatemala, India, Mexico, and the Philippines. A separate organisation, The Peniel Missionary Society, under the control of Manie and Theodore Ferguson, was formed in 1895. The objective of the organisation was: "Mission work, as God shall lead, and as means shall be provided." (Dennis). The Mission operated on the faith mission model, with workers unsalaried, and guaranteed no financial support. Despite this, by 1911, the Peniel Missionary Society was operating in the following fields: India, North Africa (Egypt), Mexico, Central America (Guatemala), South America (Argentine Republic, and Bolivia), West Indies (Puerto Rico), Alaska, and Hawaii. (Dennis)
Egypt (1895-1957).
In August 1894, Miss Ella Shaw, who had helped establish the Peniel Mission at 308 Grant Avenue in San Francisco, California on 11 November 1893, and while a mission worker at the San Diego, California Peniel Mission, advised Mrs Ferguson that she and Miss Anna (Annie) Vansant were burdened to start a Peniel Mission in Port Said, Egypt. They testified: "We must go to the most wicked port in the world." (Traschel "Africa" 107)
On 20 October 1895, the first anniversary of the opening of the Peniel Hall in Los Angeles, Shaw and Vansant departed for Egypt, arriving there on 24 November 1895, to commence the first foreign branch of the Peniel Mission. ("Love Slave", 232-233) Initially, they held religious services on British gunboats and coal ships waiting to go through the Suez Canal. "Prayer and persistence, aided by the Holy Spirit, brought bright converts." (Traschel, "Africa", 107) Shaw left Egypt in early 1897 due to ill health. She later started the Peniel Mission in New York city, and eventually (as Mrs Melody) became the secretary-treasurer of the Peniel Missionary Society.
Among the activities of the Peniel missionaries in Egypt was teaching at the American School in Port Said. Vansant, seeing that there was no Protestant church nor any school for girls in Port Said, opened a small school later that year in her apartment, and even took in three children to live with her. In the evenings she taught an English Bible class for young men. Five months after the departure of Shaw, Mary Lyons and Miss M. Watson, arrived in Port Said. Vansant, who soon contracted tuberculosis and departed for the U.S., but died before reaching New York. In 1901, Lyons established the Bethel Orphanage Faith Mission in Port Said, with Vansant's mother, Mrs Marian A. Vansant, of Los Angeles, serving as the American Secretary of that mission. It was established to "bring the Mohammedans to a saving knowledge of Christ, and to save the children from a life of vice and sin, training them, with God's help, to be missionaries and Bible-women among their own people, and giving them a thorough Arabic and English education."(Dennis)[http://www.archive.org/stream/MN41422ucmf_2/MN41422ucmf_2_djvu.txt]
In 1897, Mrs Mary Richardson arrived in Port Said and began the construction of "a beautiful and commodious school building" near the beach on Kitchener Road (now Sharia 23 July) for the Peniel American School. (Traschel, 108-109). Later Miss Sarah Longhurst, an American pensioner, arrived as a missionary at age 58. She mastered Arabic and translated hymns for an Arabic hymn book. She was assisted by Mrs Jennie Ussher (who served 1921-1943), a former secretary for General William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army. After their deaths, both were buried in Port Said.
About 1930 increased enrolments due to the school having "the highest scholastic reputation in the city" (Traschel 109) resulted in King Fuad I of Egypt underwriting the expense of a new wing (named The King's Wing) of six additional classrooms. In 1931, Charlotte Warren and Edna Schendel arrived to teach at the Peniel school. After a year, Schendel returned to the U.S. because of lung troubles and died a few years later. Warren opened the first kindergarten in all of lower Egypt, with 150 children enrolled. Ill health compelled her to return to the U.S. at the end of one term of service. (Traschel, 109-110)
In 1935, Edward J. Higgins (November 26, 1864 – December 14, 1947), the recently retired third General of The Salvation Army (1929–1934), held revival meetings in the courtyard behind the Peniel School. As a result there was formed the Salvation Army Sailors' Home, and the Salvation Army work in Alexandria, Egypt.
Before Longhurst died, Miss Christine Spurlin (later Christine Spurlin Schneider), an alumna of Bethany-Peniel Nazarene College (now Southern Nazarene University),an American school teacher, arrived in 1939 to begin her missionary service. She started weekly women's meetings. Converts attended the mission church (which was the first Protestant church in the city), which was located next to the Peniel School. Three smaller preaching points were established in Port Said, and another church was located in nearby Port Fouad, which was pastored by Pastor Massoud, who was educated by the Peniel Mission. At its peak in 1946, there were 600 female students at the Peniel American School. (Traschel 115) In 1949 Miss Ethyl Young began her missionary service at Peniel. Through the encouragement of Spurlin and Young, Rev. Samuel Doctorian (born 1930 in Beirut, Lebanon), became a Peniel missionary to Lebanon.
New government schools and changed legislation reduced the enrolment of the school dramatically and created severe financial stress by 1956. During the Suez Crisis of November 1956, the school was closed until 5 January 1957. By then, there were only 240 girls enrolled. (Traschel 120-121) In 1957, responsibility for the Egyptian mission was assumed by the National Holiness Missionary Society, currently known as the World Gospel Mission. By 1965, Miss Laura Spurlin had leadership of the Mission in Port Said.("Directory of U.A.R. Personages" 1965)
India (1896).
In June 1896 funds were donated to start the Peniel Mission in India. On 20 October 1896, the second anniversary of the opening of Peniel Hall, Mrs Anna M. Leach (who had helped pioneer the Mission at Grant Avenue in San Francisco in November 1893 and the one in Juneau, Alaska in June 1895) and Miss Rhodabaugh were commissioned to be the pioneer missionaries to India. They arrived in Bombay (now Mumbai)in December 1896. Leach died on 23 April 1899, the first Peniel missionary to die on a foreign mission field. By 1902 Peniel missionaries were running an orphanage for 20 girls at Jalgaon borrowing facilities from the Christian and Missionary Alliance. (CMA Report 1902, 133) [http://www.cmalliance.org/whoweare/archives/pdfs/annual_reports/1900s/rpt1902.pdf]
In 1909 Mrs Caroline P. Wallace and Miss Carrie A. Tennant of the Peniel Mission went to India to work with the Hindu Marriage Reform League (organised December 1909), an organization that opposed the practice of child brides and sought to raise the legal marriage age from 12 to 16.
Eventually the Dharangaon Mission Station was established in Dharangaon, East Khandesh, India for 30 years before being given to the Scandinavian Alliance Mission (now The Evangelical Alliance Mission (TEAM)). This included a Girls' School and Orphanage. "This big work proved to be too much for them. The Home Superintendent of the Peniel Mission, Mrs. Ferguson of Los Angeles, requested that the SAM take over."(Grauer 182)
Mexico.
By 1900 there was a Peniel Mission located in Progreso, Yucatán in Mexico.(Knight, n.52)[http://www.jstor.org/pss/157204]
Philippines.
By 1902 there were two Peniel missionaries in Zamboanga (province) on the island of Mindanao in the recently acquired American territory of the Philippine Islands. There was also a Peniel Mission in Davao also on Mindanao. A chapel was constructed and medical ministry provided.
China (1909).
In 1909 Rev. Albert Kato Reiton (born 7 February 1882 in Baldwin, Wisconsin) and his first wife, Edna Greer Reiton (married 15 November 1909; died January 1912), established the South China Peniel Holiness Mission (later incorporated in 1951 as the China Peniel Missionary Society 中華便以利會) in Hong Kong in December 1909. Initially they moved to Macau to learn Cantonese. They then assisted in an orphanage in Shiu Hing (now Zhaoqing) on the shores of the Xijiang River (West River), but Edna's deteriorating health forced them to plan to return to the USA for medical treatment. En route home, Edna died in January 1912 in Kobe, Japan of small pox.
Reiton married Rose Etta Femmer (died 25 July 1957 in Hong Kong) in Portland, Oregon on 20 January 1913 and they returned to Hong Kong on 4 March 1913. They served at the orphanage in Shiu Hing, before moving to Shatau (now Sha Tau Kok) to work as evangelists. On 22 November 1914 they opened the Yaumati Peniel Mission on Shanghai Street in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Soon this hall was too small to accommodate the crowds and the Mission was relocated to a former ginger factory. In 1928 the Reitons opened their first Bible Training School with Miss Alta Myers as head of the school. Initially twelve men and women enrolled. In 1930 another church was opened on Cheung Chau island 12 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong.[http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/hong-kong/popular-hong-kong-destinations/cheng-chau-island-hong-kong.html]
The Mission had ministries in Koonchung in Guangdong province, as well as in Kowloon, Shamshuipo, and Yaumati in the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong.
Among those baptised by Reiton was famous Chinese evangelist John Sung (29 September 1901 – 18 August 1944):John Sung, the "Billy Graham of China", was asked to baptize at Peniel Mission Church in Hong Kong. "But I have never been baptized by immersion myself." Therefore, on his request, missionary Rev. Reiton baptized him first, and he in turn baptized 21 women and 12 men! ("Encyclopedia of 15,000 Illustrations")[http://www2.wesleyan.org/.../Sermon%20Outlines%20Post-Easter/Post-Easter%20Sermon%20Outline%209%20-%20BAPTISM.doc]
From 1939, the Reiton's daughter, Helen Elizabeth Reiton (born 12 June 1916 in Hong Kong; died 14 December 2005) and her husband, Robert (Bob) Bruce Hammond (born 1 March 1914 in Hong Kong; died 2 September 2002), whom she married on 16 June 1939 in Pasadena, California, returned to Hong Kong in November 1939 to assist the Reitons as missionaries. After the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1942, the Peniel missionaries hid for 46 days, before being interned at the Stanley Internment Camp on Hong Kong island for six months before being repatriated back to the USA on 29 June 1942 - initially aboard the "Asama Maru" to Lourenço Marques, Portuguese East Africa (now Maputo, Mozambique). On 22 July 1942 they were transferred to the Swedish ship, "MS Gripsholm (1925)" for the final leg to New York.(Hammond)
After completing his education at the Pasadena College of the Church of the Nazarene in 1945, Bob Hammond started a missionary radio programme in June 1945 on KGER, a Christian radio station in Long Beach, California to raise funds for the ministry in China and throughout Asia. As many as 50,000 people listened on a regular basis. This programme continued for 46 years.[http://www.vocamissions.com/Founders.html]
V.O.C.A. and other Asian Nations (1946).
After World War 2, the missionaries returned. They organised themselves as the Voice of China (later Voice of China and Asia - V.O.C.A.) Missionary Society, an interdenominational missionary agency based in Pasadena, California.
This agency is the international coordinating agency for the Peniel missions and churches in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea (1951), and the Philippines. The mission is involved in evangelism, church planting, relief work, orphanages, leprosaria, Sunday School, the Peniel Theological College and Seminary (based in Busan, South Korea, and Peniel High School of the Arts (also located in Busan). Its mission magazine is the "Voice of China and Asia Flashlight".[http://ricci.rt.usfca.edu/institution/view.aspx?institutionID=567][http://www.vocamissions.com/Founders.html][http://www.vocamissions.com/index.html]
South America (1906-1920).
The Peniel Mission (Sociedad Peniel Hall) work in South America began as the result of the conversion of an Italian entrepreneur named Antonio Chiriotto (1830–1911), originally from Turin, Italy. After several years in Argentina and Peru, Chiriotto immigrated to Los Angeles, California, where he became wealthy, and was converted to the Christian faith. After he had been in California for about ten years, a colporteur tried to sell him a Bible. Antonio denied him repeatedly. He did not want to have anything to do with the Bible. However, the tireless colporteur persisted in visiting him, and one day after a conversation that went on for several hours, Antonio burst into tears. He bought a Bible and began to go to the meetings at a little church called "Peniel." There he found his Savior. After some years, probably about 1906, Chiriotto felt that the Lord was calling him to begin a missionary work in Argentina, where he had first gone after emigrating from Italy. 
Argentina (1906).
In 1906 Chiriotto went to Argentina. In Buenos Aires, he established an evangelical work, paying for all the expenses personally. Out of gratitude to the church where he had first met the Lord, he called the new church "Peniel Mission." However, under the Argentine laws at that time, it was impossible to develop the mission that was started there.
Bolivia (1911-1920).
Chiriotto, despite health problems, travelled to Bolivia in 1911 to establish a Peniel Mission. Upon his arrival in La Paz, he saw the Aymara indigenous people as poor, exploited, ignorant, and forgotten. He had compassion on them and proposed taking education and salvation to them." The altitude and the cold climate of La Paz were not kind to him, and he fell ill and died in November 1911. However, before his death, Antonio wrote his last will and testament, leaving the sum of $30,000 to the "Peniel Society" that was composed of three men. They made sure Antonio Chiriotto's money was used for the purchase of a farm with the objective of obtaining the conversion and the education of the Indians. 
The Huatajata (later spelled Guatajata) Farm (soon renamed Peniel Hall), located on the northeast shore of Lake Titicaca, about 105 km northwest of La Paz, was bought, With the land came 48 heads of families and 275 serfs. Here it was possible to meet the desires and wishes of Antonio Chiriotto, to give the indigenous people education and a possible Christian experience. The farm itself, a 1,000-acre former hacienda on which vegetables and grain were cultivated and sheep herding was practiced, possessed great agricultural potential. At the time in which the Huatajata farm was acquired, the Indians were the burden-bearers—the human pack-animals of priests, politicians, and property-owners—who, in Bolivia, enjoyed few rights and social privileges. It was exclusively an Aymara community. 
Initially the Bolivian government provided $2,000 annually to support the Mission in this endeavour. The directors of Peniel Hall Farm (two Methodist missionaries and a Baptist missionary) administrated the property for short periods, because it was difficult to operate the farm on Christian principles. Samuel Inman indicates that the reasons for the difficulties of this Mission included maladministration by missionaries, loss of Government support and sponsorship, inadequate financing, and leadership disagreements. This work, so auspiciously begun a few years ago, has encountered all kinds of difficulties. The trustees seem not to have managed their responsibilities very well; difficulties have come up between them and the directors ; the Government has become dissatisfied with the small amount of educational work done and has withdrawn its support. Most money was wasted in buying a motor-boat, which proved to be unusable ; the funds destined for school work are being paid out in interest for a large amount of land, much of which is not usable. The directors have been changed several times, and at present they are "looking for an other member.I have not found a sadder situation than this one in all South America. It gives point to the fact that unquestionably the best way to do a permanent work in these countries is to organize it under a strong mission Board which has a permanent constituency, and has developed a policy of management that assures permanency and a business-like expenditure of funds. (Inman 80-81)
In light of these difficulties, on October 1, 1920, the Canadian Baptist Mission assumed complete responsibility for the administration of the property, and the last Peniel Mission outpost in South America was closed. In 1927 William Abel, a Native American, converted by the Oregon Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends (Quakers), who had served as a missionary in the Philippines, was appointed to serve under the Peniel Mission in Bolivia, but died after a few months of small pox. (Williams 259-260)
Demise of the Peniel Missionary Society (1949).
In 1949 the Peniel Mission became a part of the present-day World Gospel Mission (Pounds 2).[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/ear_01/ear_01_00070.html]

<doc id="18267561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18267561" title="The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald">
The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald

The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald is a two-part television film shown on ABC-TV in September 1977. The film starred Ben Gazzara, Lorne Greene and John Pleshette in the title role. It is an example of alternate history. The hypothesis is what might have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald had not been killed by Jack Ruby and had stood trial for the murder of President John F. Kennedy.
Synopsis.
The film opens sometime in 1964 and we see Oswald in a maximum security cage as a radio announcer tells how he has been on trial for the last 43 days as the eyes of the entire world watch. A bailiff announces the jury has reached a verdict and the world press rushes to their phones. We see Oswald being handcuffed and led back into the courtroom to learn his fate.
The film then flashes back to the day before the Kennedy assassination. We see Oswald trying to reconcile with his estranged wife Marina without luck. The next day, a friend drives him to the Texas School Book Depository and he puts a wrapped package in the backseat. The assassination of Kennedy is then reenacted with chilling conviction (it was very graphic for 1977). Oswald leaves the building and we are to infer murders police officer J. D. Tippit. We see him being arrested in a theater and bound over for trial.
Oswald's prosecutor is wily, sarcastic Anson "Kip" Roberts (Gazzara). From the beginning, Roberts is skeptical about a "poor shlub who couldn't even hold a job" assassinating the President. However, a phone call from President Johnson himself makes him realize he had better stick to this hypothesis. In the meantime, bombastic defense attorney Matt Weldon (Greene) is assigned to the defense. He realizes he has a difficult client upon their first meeting when Oswald keeps talking in paranoid fashion about "them" and "they" manipulating the strings. In addition, Weldon has to deal with several cases of possible witnesses for the defense dying under suspicious circumstances.
A change of venue moves the "trial of the century" to a small Texas town. Roberts and Weldon square off before a stern judge who immediately lets them know who is in charge of the courtroom. Weldon conducts a formidable defense in the beginning casting doubt on the testimony of eyewitnesses. He and his investigators interview Oswald's wife and mother and associates to try to obtain a clearer picture of "the man of mystery". However, the picture only grows darker as we see Oswald in flashbacks defecting to the USSR, returning to the US and in the company of various shady individuals. Oswald stubbornly refuses to cooperate when Weldon urges him to open up and tell the truth, as it might help save him from the electric chair. Although Lee insists on taking the stand in his own defense, he mysteriously refuses to talk when Weldon presses him. Roberts begins his cross examination by asking Oswald why there is a picture of him with a rifle, a palmprint of his on the murder weapon and a money order buying the Mannlicher Carcano which killed Kennedy. Oswald merely says the evidence is faked. The prosecutor applies an unusual method of cross examination by mentioning an argument Oswald and Marina had the night before the assassination when Marina wanted to watch JFK on TV and Lee kept turning the set off over and over. Roberts demands "Isn't that why you decided to kill President John F. Kennedy, because Marina wanted to watch him on TV?" In his only display of emotion during the trial Oswald screams a denial. The film then ends as it began with the prisoner being led back into the courtroom. Dallas Police Detective Jim Leavelle made a brief cameo appearance playing himself in this scene. Oswald is then shot and killed by Ruby in an eerie return to reality. It flashes on the screen that the makers of the film cannot provide the role of a jury and the final verdict is ours alone.

NGC 6820 and NGC 6823

NGC 6820 is an emission nebula that surrounds open cluster NGC 6823 in Vulpecula, near M27, the Dumbbell Nebula. The nebula NGC 6820 is also called Sharpless catalog Sh 2-86.
The most striking feature is the trunk-like pillar of dust and gas protruding from the east side of the nebula towards the open cluster, NGC 6823 in the west. The center of the open cluster is about two million years old and is predominantly represented by many young, bright blue stars. Outer parts of the cluster intimately involving pillars of emission nebula NGC 6820, contain even younger stars. The huge pillars of gas and dust are probably formed when surrounding gas and dust is pushed and eroded away by radiation from nearby stars. Remarkable dark globules of gas and dust are also visible in the nebula, much as is seen in the better known Eagle Nebula in Serpens or the Lagoon Nebula in Sagittarius.
Open star cluster NGC 6823 is about 50 light years across and lies about 6000 light years away.

The Tollbooth

The Tollbooth is a coming-of-age film (2004) directed by Debra Kirschner about a young artist struggling to forge her own identity in the big city, while her Jewish parents keep watch from just over the bridge in Brooklyn.
Review.
Recently out of art school, the lead character of the film, Sarabeth (Marla Sokoloff) gets a job as a waitress and begins her struggle as a New York City artist. With her angsty and cynical personality, she doesn’t have much patience for her family—a nagging mother, a father who is always misquoting Kafka, one sister who just got pregnant with her sweet but dopey husband, and another sister who is ‘perfect’ until she announces she’s a lesbian at Rosh Hashanah dinner. And then there’s her boyfriend Simon (Rob Mcelhenney), whose choice to live in the suburbs with a great sound system instead of hip and unpredictable New York has given Sarabeth doubts about their future together. She uses her canvas as an escape, where she can make sense of it all.
"The Tollbooth" tackles serious Jewish issues as they present themselves to a politically liberal, anti-traditional, feminist post graduate. As frustrated as Sarabeth is that she grew up being constantly reminded of relatives who died in the Holocaust, and no matter how much she hates going to synagogue, the truth is that she’s Jewish and she will always be Jewish. The struggle to escape her roots is impossible, so she’s forced to integrate a 5,000-year-old religion into her modern life.
This epiphany comes to Sarabeth when she finds herself feeling out of place at a 4th of July barbecue. She is a little-black-dress-wearing, wine drinking, daughter-of-an-anti-patriot; among pastel colors, beer and fire works. And ultimately considers herself a "sore thumb". But when she overhears one of the party’s guests make an anti-Semitic comment, and realizes she doesn’t want to fit it in to this crowd, and that she is proud of her heritage.
For those not familiar with socio-economic structure of New York City this film’s dialogue may came off as funny. However to viewers that have experienced life in the city, will understand that the living situations described are real. When Sarabeth tells her waitress friend that she’s moving into a walk-in closet, they tell her she should be grateful because at least she’ll have a door. "I haven’t had a door since I moved to New York," one girl says, "I live in a studio with six other dancers."
"The Tollbooth" accurately depicts New York City’s art scene. As a waitress, Sarabeth observes that the creative types that she works with have been chasing their dreams to be professional working artists for the past 5 to 10 years—in the meantime they continue to wait tables. Sarabeth herself has a hard time with her art. Galleries couldn’t care less about her, and the professor who promised to help her make connections won’t return her calls. 
But a career isn’t the only thing that plagues a young woman setting out on her life: Sarabeth’s boyfriend can be just as stressful. He suggests that Sarabeth move to the suburbs to be with him, and while she would enjoy paying cheaper rent, she could not bear the thought of leaving the city.
At a pivotal moment, when she feels like she’s deciding the rest of her life, Sarabeth hears the famously wise words of the Jewish sage Hillel and remembers her mother’s oft-repeated advice. Armed with the combined wisdom of her Jewish heritage and her family, Sarabeth is ready to forge ahead, making her own decisions and living her life the best she can, in her own way.

Philosophy.
The School is believed to be unique among art schools although there are many theoretical programmes in western universities at graduate and postgraduate level, there are no colleges apart from the School where the practical skills of the Islamic and traditional arts are taught at this level. 
The School strives to preserve global traditional arts and traditions under threat of extinction .
Building.
Based in the fashionable and artistic area of Shoreditch, an average of 25 students work permanently on site, numbers increasing with students studying PhDs and open courses.
History.
The School was originally established as the Visual Islamic and Traditional Arts Programme (VITA) at the Royal College of Art in 1984. It was the brainchild of Dr. Keith Critchlow, the Professor Emeritus at the School, who is also the author of several books on Sacred Geometry.
The Programme transferred to The Prince of Wales’ Institute of Architecture in 1993 which subsequently became incorporated into The Prince's Foundation in 2000. The School was initiated as a separate charity of HRH Charles, Prince of Wales in April 2004.
Postgraduate degrees.
Three postgraduate degrees are offered by the school: a Master of Arts (MA), awarded by the University of Wales, a Master of Philosophy degree (MPhil), also awarded by the University of Wales and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).

John Farrar (scientist)

John Farrar (July 1, 1779 – May 8, 1853) was an American scholar. He first coined the concept of hurricanes as “a moving vortex and not the rushing forward of a great body of the atmosphere”, after the Great September Gale of 1815. Farrar remained Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard University between 1807 and 1836. During this time, he introduced modern mathematics into the curriculum. He was also a regular contributor to the scientific journals.
Life and works.
After attending Phillips Academy, Andover, and graduating from Harvard in 1803, Farrar then studied theology at Phillips Academy, and in 1805 was appointed Greek tutor at Harvard. Farrar was chosen Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in 1807. He retained the chair till 1836, when he resigned in consequence of a painful illness that finally caused his death. His second wife, Eliza Ware Farrar (née Rotch), was Flemish. She married him in 1828. She authored several children's books.
Farrar maintained weather records between 1807-1817 at Cambridge, Massachusetts. For the 23 September 1815 hurricane, he particularly noted the shape as "a moving vortex". He also observed the veering of the wind, and its different times of subsequent impacts on the cities of Boston and New York. 
In 1815, Farrar made efforts to build an observatory at Harvard. However, despite of continuing efforts, the project failed to take off due to lack of funds.

<doc id="18267750" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18267750" title="Singdarin">
Singdarin

Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, also known as Singdarin () is an interlanguage native to Singapore. In Taiwan, this language variety is known as Singnese (). It is based on Mandarin but has a large amount of English in its vocabulary. For this reason, Singdarin is sometimes known as "Anglo-Chinese". There were also words from Malay and other Chinese dialects.
In general, well-educated Chinese Singaporeans are able to code-switch between Singdarin and Standard Mandarin.
Singdarin grammar is usually identical to Mandarin. In some circumstances, there is code-switching with English. Singdarin vocabulary consists of a large number of words from English, Hokkien, and Malay, among other languages, often when speakers do not know the Mandarin equivalent of what they wish to express, and instead use English words to convey the meaning.
Native Chinese from China or native Taiwanese from Taiwan generally find it difficult to understand Singdarin due to large number of English or non-Mandarin words used. The Singaporean government currently discourages the use of Singdarin in favour of Standard Singaporean Mandarin as it believes in the need for Singaporeans to be able to communicate effectively with native Chinese from China or Taiwan.
Origins.
Like its Singlish equivalent, Singdarin evolved because many Singaporean Chinese families come from mixed language environments. For instance, children may be raised in households in which one parent speaks English while the other speaks Chinese.
Singdarin has also evolved largely because Singapore is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual society. One of the most important policies of the Singaporean government is to ensure social and multi-ethnic harmony. Therefore, instead of letting certain ethnic groups to live in an isolated community like they did in the past, the Singapore government encourages the majority of Singaporeans to live in HDB flats that have now become a melting pot of Chinese, Malays, Indians and other different ethnicity who speak different languages. This is believed to reduce differences between the diverse linguistic and ethnic groups in Singapore.
As the majority of Singaporeans live in HDB flats, which have families coming from various linguistic, racial and ethnic background, there is a tendency for different languages to be mixed in order to facilitate more effective communication between the different races. In short, it leads to the creation of a hybrid culture (known colloquially as a "rojak" culture).
This and the tendency for the Singaporean Chinese people to use the mixed language that they use at home in daily colloquial conversation has since influenced the Mandarin spoken in schools, resulting in "Singdarin" being formed. It was in this environment that Singdarin developed.
Examples of Singdarin (Anglo-Chinese) dialogue.
Below are some examples of Singdarin dialogue spoken amongst some Chinese Singaporeans.
1 Usually the word 'station' is omitted.
English loanwords.
The following are the common English loan words used in Singdarin.
Loanwords from other languages.
Just like Singlish, certain words used in Singlish are also interchangeably used in Singdarin.
Usage of English technical terms.
Since English is the main working and educational language of Singapore, many Chinese Singaporeans are more familiar with the English professional terminology (technical terms) used at work, rather than that of Mandarin. This led to many Chinese Singaporeans tending to mix large number of English professional terms into Mandarin at work, instead of using Chinese technical terms. As such, a form of Singdarin spoken at work appears, resulting in some degree of communication barrier at work between the Chinese Singaporeans and the Chinese from China or Taiwan.
Comparison between Singdarin spoken at work in Singapore and Mandarin spoken at work in China is shown below:
Other terms associated with Singdarin.
There are other terms associated with Singdarin such as "Broken Chinese", "Half-bucket" (半桶水） or "Half-past Six Chinese". These are the terms used by Singaporean Chinese-language professionals to refer to the mediocre (or low) proficiency level of Mandarin amongst certain Chinese Singaporeans. The terms describe that when measured against Standard Mandarin, certain Chinese Singaporeans are only 50-65% proficient in Mandarin.
Part of the reasons for these could be due to the widespread use of Singdarin in Singapore. Singdarin has led to the impression of "broken Chinese" or "bad Chinese", and is generally considered to be an adulterated form of Mandarin language. Speaking Singdarin is a natural linguistic habit derived from speaking a mixed language in the daily life of Singaporeans. However, the lower proficiency in Mandarin Chinese was mainly due to a lack of practice and exposure to more proper Chinese language, a lack of practice in speaking, hearing, reading and writing Chinese. This further led to a limited Chinese vocabulary or knowledge on Chinese cultural subjects, thus making it difficult for Singdarin speakers to speak pure Mandarin fluently. Singdarin speakers will generally find it difficult to communicate (at a higher level) if they were to communicate with native Chinese from China or Taiwan.

John Sugar (Suker) (born at Wombourn, Staffordshire, 1558; executed at Warwick, 16 July 1604) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987.
Life.
He matriculated at the University of Oxford from St. Mary's Hall of Oriel College, 30 October 1584, and is described as the son of a priest ("clerici filius"). He left without taking a degree, it is said because he disliked the Oath of Supremacy; but it appears that he acted as a Protestant minister at Cannock, Staffordshire, for some time.
He was ordained priest from the English College, Douai (1601), and sent on the mission the same year. He was arrested 8 July 1603, at Rowington, Warwickshire, with 'Robert Grissold', a native of Rowington (in the service of Mr. Sheldon of Broadway, Worcestershire), who was in attendance on him. After a year's imprisonment at Warwick they were condemned there 14 July, Sugar for being a priest, and Grissold for assisting him. Sugar was cut down before he was fully dead. Grissold was offered his life if he would promise to conform to the Church of England.

Prospect Hill (New Haven)

Prospect Hill is a neighborhood of the city of New Haven, Connecticut located in the north central portion of the city, directly north of Downtown New Haven. The neighborhood contains residences, institutional buildings of Albertus Magnus University and a portion of the main campus of Yale University, including the Science Hill area, the Hillhouse Avenue area and the Yale Peabody Museum. The City of New Haven defines the neighborhood to be the region bounded by the town of Hamden in the north, Winchester Avenue in the west, Munson Street/Hillside Place/Prospect Street in the southwest, Trumbull Street in the south, and Whitney Avenue in the east. Prospect Street is the main thoroughfare through the neighborhood.
Historic district.
The Prospect Hill Historic District is a historic district that is significant primarily for its architecture. It encompasses most of the residential portion of the Prospect Hill neighborhood. The historic district includes major collections of Queen Anne architecture, Shingle Style architecture, Colonial Revival architecture, and Tudor Revival architecture. Numerous other styles are also represented. Some of the more significant properties which are included in the neighborhood are:
Other historic districts.
In addition to the main Prospect Hill Historic District, the neighborhood planning zone includes the Hillhouse Avenue Historic District, an area adjoining Downtown New Haven south of Science Hill, and part of Edgerton Park. Because the neighborhood planning zone eastern boundary runs along Whitney Avenue, a row of houses on the west side of the Whitney Avenue Historic District of East Rock is technically also within the neighborhood planning zone.
Demographics.

Robert Dyer

Robert Dyer (6 March 1808 – 4 February 1887) left the village of Heytesbury, in the county of Wiltshire, England to voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to serve as a Newfoundland School Society teacher in the fishing community of Greenspond, Newfoundland. The Newfoundland School Society was established by the English merchant, Samuel Codner, who realised the need for educating the poor population of Newfoundland, and other poor colonies in British North America as well. Dyer arrived for his first time in Newfoundland, in 1839 and began his career as a teacher. Dyer stayed in Greenspond for twenty years, earning the respect and admiration of all the inhabitants and anyone who met or worked with him. Dyer was also ordained a Church of England Deacon in 1849; therefore, his work in Greenspond consisted of both teaching and ministerial duties. Dyer and his family later moved to Alberton, Prince Edward Island, where he was a minister in a Church of England Parish.
Early life.
Robert Dyer was born on 6 March 1808 to Thomas and Sarah (Smith) Dyer, who lived in the county of Wiltshire, England. In 1837, records show that Dyer was listed as a shoemaker in the village of Heytesbury, just a few miles from Chitterne, also in the county of Wiltshire. Robert Dyer's great grandfather, Simon Dyer Senior, had also been a shoemaker in Heytesbury. On 3 August 1837, Dyer sent a letter of recommendation from the Vicarage in Chitterne, signed by a Reverend J. Leach Povey to the Newfoundland School Society wishing to serve as a teacher in Newfoundland.
Training.
Dyer's application was accepted by the Newfoundland School Society (N.S.S.) and he entered into Westminster Central School for training in 1838. The Westminster Central School was set up to train teachers for England and Wales, but eventually contributed greatly to the training of teachers for other countries and colonies of Britain. The school was created for the elementary education of the 'humble poor'. The training was for masters and mistresses who wished to teach in schools that were created for children of the 'labouring classes'. Dyer encountered some difficulties during his training to become a teacher for educating the poor; however, by March 1839, after about four months, he had successfully completed his training as a N.S.S. teacher.
Greenspond.
Robert Dyer arrived in Newfoundland in 1839 to begin his twenty-year career as N.S.S. school master in Greenspond, Bonavista Bay, which he recorded almost daily in his diary. Dyer taught in a Church of England school system at a time when the Church, and not the state, played a central role in the development and delivery of the curriculum. Dyer worked in a single-room school that frequently accommodated more than 100 pupils of all ages and grade levels. Education was not free, most people had to pay subscriptions to the teacher for his salary and maintenance of the school. However, many families in Newfoundland during this period were poor and often could not pay. In these cases, the teachers salary was supplemented by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and aid also came from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Education in Newfoundland faced many obstacles, such as irregular attendance. Dyer notes a number of reasons for absenteeism in his diary – some older children worked in the fishery during the spring and summer, others moved inland with their families each winter to take part in the logging industry, and bad weather frequently kept students at home. Poverty was another major problem for families that could not afford school fees or adequate clothing for their children. The Newfoundland School Society and Robert Dyer, along with his wife Mrs. Elizabeth Dyer maintained a very successful elementary school in Greenspond for all boys and girls ranging in age from about 3 to 16. The children at Greenspond were usually advanced in their lessons and the school always had a large attendance. In 1844, for example, there was an average attendance of 103 children and by May 1847, 119 girls and 110 boys were recorded on the attendance, a total of 229 students. In 1850 Robert Dyer recorded in his diary that a visiting judge, Judge Des Barres, had claimed that the school in Greenspond was the "largest in the island". In 1852 Dyer recorded an attendance of 283, shortly after, Dyer made a request for an infant school, and in 1854 the number on the books for the infant school was 300. The Rev Vicars inspected the school on 28 August 1856 and found 109 infants under the care of a school mistress, Miss Oakley.
Family.
Robert Dyer left Greenspond briefly in 1845 to be married in England. Dyer married Elizabeth Bartlett, daughter of Josiah and Sarah Ann (Hughes) Bartlett, on 15 April 1845, at St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe, in London. Robert and Elizabeth had five children: William Bartlett Dyer (22 July 1846), Henry Thomas Dyer (31 October 1847), Joseph Lake Dyer (23 May 1849), Louise Sarah Dyer (20 April 1851, Louise died and was buried on 28 June 1852, at the age of 1 year and 2 months), and Isabella Dyer (8 August 1852). William Dyer became a teacher in Prince Edward Island, and later became a pharmacist; he moved back to England in 1909. Henry Dyer was a telegraph operator, Isabella married a John Charles Travers, and Joseph Dyer was a merchant in Prince Edward Island. Joseph's daughter, Alice Maude, was a nurse but later became the first registered woman pharmacist in Prince Edward Island when she received her diploma in this field, in 1928.
Ordination.
Robert Dyer's duties extended far beyond the classroom in Greenspond. He often visited surrounding communities either alone, or with the resident clergyman, who, during Dyer's stay, was Rev. James Gilchrist and later, Rev. Julian Moreton. During this period, there was a severe shortage of clergymen in Newfoundland; therefore, "missions" were established, so that the clergyman in a community visited surrounding settlements regularly to hold services, baptisms, funerals, etc. The Greenspond Mission, which underwent several changes, generally included such settlements as Swain's Island, Pinchard's Island, Lumsden, Flowers Island, among others. Dyer would visit these communities and inspect their schools, visit the sick, and read scriptures. Reading was extremely important during this time, as most people could not read, and if they did not have a resident clergyman, they depended on others to read and teach them the Bible. Therefore, Dyer had much experience with ministrial duties before being ordained. Finally, in 1849, the Church of England Bishop of Newfoundland, Edward Feild, agreed to ordain Dyer. Dyer went to St. John's in May, he began studying for his deacon's examinations upon his arrival, and passed all of the tests. Robert Dyer was admitted to the diaconate on 3 May 1849; and was ordained to the Diaconate by Bishop Edward Field.
Prince Edward Island.
A letter from the Rev. R. W. Dyer, dated Greenspond, Newfoundland, 2 Nov 1852, reported on the progress of his work at Greenspond but also expressed his desire to be removed to another colony in which the Bishop is friendly and where he may have more full exercise of his ministry. Therefore, in the spring of 1859 Robert Dyer and his family left Greenspond and on 7 July 1859, they sailed for Prince Edward Island where he was to serve until 1884. Rev. Dyer was responsible for establishing the second Church of England parish west of St. Eleanors. For nearly 26 years he ministered to the communities of Cascumpec (later Alberton), Tignish, Kildare Capes and the surrounding areas. In the beginning his ministry took place in the homes of communicants, school houses and temperance halls but eventually churches were built in these locations culminating in the consecration of the original St. Peter's in Cascumpec in September 1869. Rev. Dyer resigned in 1886 and died shortly after, on 4 February 1887.

Edmund Sykes

Edmund Sykes (born at Leeds; executed at York Tyburn, 23 March 1587) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987.
Life.
He was a student at the College at Reims, where he was ordained 21 February 1581. He was sent to the English Mission on 5 June following.
Working in Yorkshire, his health broke down. Arthur Webster, an apostate Catholic, took advantage of his illness to betray him, and he was committed to the York Kidcot by the Council of the North. He consented once to be present at a Protestant service; but he refused to repeat the act and remained a prisoner.
After confinement for about six months, he was again brought before the Council and sentenced to banishment. On 23 August 1585, he was transferred to Hull Castle, and within a week shipped beyond the seas. He made his way to Rome, where he was entertained at the English College, for nine days from 15 April 1586. He wanted to atone for his lapse by the pilgrimage, and he also entertained some thoughts of entering a religious order. He decided that it was God's will that he should return to the English mission, and reaching Reims on 10 June, he left again for England on 16 June.
After about six months he was betrayed by his brother, to whose house in Wath he had resorted, and was sent a close prisoner to York Castle by the Council. He was arraigned at the Lent Assizes, condemned as a traitor on the score of his priesthood, and on 23 March 1587 was drawn on the hurdle from the castle yard to York Tyburn, where he suffered the death penalty.

<doc id="18268072" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18268072" title="Winter's law">
Winter's law

Winter's law—named after Werner Winter, who postulated it in 1978—is a sound law operating on Balto-Slavic short vowels */e/, */o/, */a/ (< PIE *h₂e), */i/ and */u/, according to which they lengthen before unaspirated voiced stops, and that syllable gains rising, acute accent.
Compare;
Winter's law is important for several reasons. Most importantly, it is supposed to show the difference between the reflexes of PIE */b/, */d/, */g/, */gʷ/ in Balto-Slavic (in front of which Winter's law operates in closed syllable), and PIE */bʰ/, */dʰ/, */gʰ/, */gʷʰ/ (before which there is no effect of Winter's law). This shows that in relative chronology Winter's law operated before PIE aspirated stops */bʰ/, */dʰ/, */gʰ/ merged with PIE plain voiced stops */b/, */d/, */g/ in Balto-Slavic. 
Secondary, Winter's law is also supposed to show the difference between the reflexes of PIE *h₂e > */a/ and PIE */o/ which otherwise merged to */a/ in Balto-Slavic. When these vowels lengthen in accordance with Winter's law, one can see that old */a/ (< PIE *h₂e) has lengthened into Balto-Slavic */ā/ (which later gave Lithuanian /o/, Latvian /ā/, OCS /a/), and old */o/ has lengthened into Balto-Slavic */ō/ (which later gave Lithuanian and Latvian "uo", but OCS /a/). In later development that represented Common Slavic innovation, the reflexes of Balto-Slavic */ā/ and */ō/ were merged, as one can see that they both result in OCS /a/. This also shows that Winter's law operated prior to the common Balto-Slavic change */o/ > */a/.
The original formulation of Winter's law stated that the vowels regularly lengthened in front of PIE voiced stops in all environments. As much as there were numerous examples that supported this formulation, there were also many counterexamples, such as OCS "stogъ" "stack" < PIE *stógos, OCS "voda" "water" < PIE * (collective noun formed from PIE *). An adjustment of Winter's law, with the conclusion that it operates only on closed syllables, was proposed by Matasović in 1994. Matasović's revision of Winter's law has been used in the Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben. Other variations of the blocking mechanism for Winter's law have been proposed by Kortlandt, Shintani, Rasmussen, Dybo and Holst. 
Criticism.
Winter's law is not taken for granted by all specialists in Balto-Slavic historical linguistics. A study of counter-evidences led Patri (2006) to conclude that there is no law at all. According to him, exceptions to the law create a too heterogeneous and voluminous data-set to allow any phonological generalization.

CG634

The CG634 is the Canadian Forces' main combat helmet. It was introduced in 1997 and is based on the French Gallet TC-3 helmet.
History.
The Canadian military sought a replacement for the steel M1 Helmet in the 1980s. In 1984 it trialed the British Mk. 6, the American PASGT, and the Israeli OR402 composite helmets to determine the best characteristics of form, fit and, ballistic protection. A concept design was developed and the Barrday Co. of Cambridge Ontario received a contract to produce over 2,000 Spectra helmets between 1988 and 1990 for ballistic, engineering, and user trials. While the Barrday helmet performed well ballistically, field trials identified significant shortcomings. The Barrday contract was scrapped and the search for a new helmet resumed in late 1992. After testing a number of European off-the-shelf designs the process was completed in May 1996 and a contract to produce 60,000 helmets was issued to the French company Gallet, which produced the TC-3 helmet and its variants for the French, Danish, and Austrian armies. From 1997 to 2004 the CG634 was manufactured by Gallet Sécurité Internationale in Saint-Romuald, Quebec. Subsequent contracts have been placed with MSA, which bought Gallet in 2002.
Design.
The CG634 is made of Aramid (Kevlar) and has a minimum v50 of 634 m/s (compared to the PASGT's 610 m/s). It mates a modified French design, based on the PASGT, but adapted for comptability with Canadian equipment (head-set, respirator, vision devices, and armoured vest). The suspension system combines a thick foam trauma liner with a rubber and nylon webbing suspension based on the French Mle-78 (Gallet TC-3). The CG634 has a 4 point chinstrap with flip down adjustment pieces.
The CG634 has a somewhat similar shape and is sometimes mistaken for the later United States Army's MICH TC-2000 Combat Helmet. The MICH uses a foam padding system in its ground combat helmet instead of webbing. The only pad system approved for use in combat is manufactured by Team Wendy and supplied by National Industries for the Blind. These pads may also be used with the CG634.
When necessary, a night vision goggle mount is issued. The mount consists of a green metal bracket that hooks over the front of the helmet and the mount which is screwed into it. There is a strap that loops through the mount and connects to a large ring which is usually on the top of the helmet and two more straps secure the mount to the back of the helmet. The mount is compatible with AN/PVS-7 and AN/PVS-14 night vision systems.

Netiv HaAsara

Netiv HaAsara (, "lit." Path of the Ten) is a moshav in southern Israel. Located in the north-west Negev, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof Ashkelon Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 704.
History.
The moshav was founded in 1982 by 70 families who were residents of the former Israeli settlement of Netiv HaAsara in the Sinai Peninsula, which was evacuated as a result of the Camp David Accords. The original moshav had been named for ten soldiers that were killed in a helicopter accident south of Rafah in 1971, and was originally named "Minyan".
After Israel's disengagement from Gaza in 2005, Netiv HaAsara became the closest community in Israel to the Gaza Strip, located 400 meters away from the edge of the Palestinian town of Beit Lahiya. At the southern edge of the village, a car park was converted into an Israel Defense Forces base and tanks were deployed. An electric fence was erected to stop infiltration attempts from Gaza, and three concrete walls were built against potential Palestinian snipers.
The moshav was a target of Qassam rockets, Katyusha rockets, and mortar shellings, In 2007, the Popular Resistance Committees sent two guerrillas to infiltrate the moshav, but they were killed by the IDF. 
Dana Galkowicz, a 22-year old Israeli-Brazilian woman, was killed on July 14, 2005 at Netiv HaAsara by a Qassam rocket. On March 20, 2010, a Thai worker was killed.

Excessive Force (film)

Excessive Force is a 1993 American action film, written by Thomas Ian Griffith and co-starring Burt Young, directed by Jon Hess.
Plot.
Terry (Thomas Ian Griffith) and his two partners from the Chicago special investigation police squad are engaged in war against Chicago's mafia boss, DiMarco (Burt Young). Despite many attempts to jail him, he always manages somehow to walk free. Not discouraged by that, police prepares another action to raise some evidence against DiMarco, this time it's a controlled sale of drugs for $3 million. After the exchange of the money for the narcotics police wants to arrest gangsters involved in the business, unfortunately this won't come without a shootout, during one of them manages to escape (only to be killed later by DiMarco himself, for losing the mafia's money). The other gangster which was wounded during the shooting is making confessions in the hospital (forced by Terry), those are though worthless in the eyes of the judge, who rules that the interrogation was held with use of 'excessive force' and as that was illegal. DiMarco is once again free, furthermore now he wants vengeance on the police who, as he thinks stole his money. Terry's co-cops are being killed one by one and soon he finds himself in peril, especially after he learns that DiMarco's suspicions are not so quite abstract.
Sequel.
A sequel, "Excessive Force II: Force on Force", was released directly to VHS in 1995. It was directed by Jonathan Winfrey and produced by Lisa M. Hansen.
The sequel bears little to no relation to the first film.
Reception.
Malcolm Johnson, of "The Hartford Courant", says that "about the best that can be said for this tale…is that Griffith exhibits a mournful Irish dash to go with his high karate kicks and that Todd shows a far different side of his acting talent than he revealed in "Candyman"."

Thomas Slythurst

Thomas Slythurst (died 1560) was an English academic and Roman Catholic priest. He was the first President of Trinity College, Oxford. He lost his positions in 1559, on the accession of Elizabeth I of England, by his refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy. It has been said that he died in the Tower of London, but this is contested.

<doc id="18268322" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18268322" title="Trade Union Act 1984">
Trade Union Act 1984

The Trade Union Act 1984 was a law in the United Kingdom that required all trade unions to hold a secret ballot before calling a strike. The majority of the act did not apply to trade unions based in Northern Ireland. The act was repealed on 16 October 1992. Peter Bottomley, who is current MP for Worthing West, reportedly said that the act was "designed to ensure that trade unions are more democratic and their leaders more accountable to their members." 
The act also required unions to elect a new general secretary every five years and to validate funds every ten years.
Kenneth Clarke, who was a politician for the Conservative Party (UK) reported that, at a point approximately two years after the passing of the bill, 19 unions changed the practice to comply with the act. The act also says that those who are in high up positions in the union must "be accountable to the membership the union as a whole.
Context.
At the time the act was passed, the UK miner's strike had just started and, as a result, the government passed acts like this to limit the effect caused by strikes by this. Some people have said that the law was passed after the start of the Falkland's war due to the increase in popularity for the government brought on by the conflict.
Effect.
The act limited the amount of industrial action by strengthening the requirements for a strike to be considered lawful. It also allowed the legality of the miners' strike to be questioned, as members of the National Union of Mineworkers were not given the chance to vote on this issue.
As a result of this act, striking miners were not entitled to state benefits, thus forcing the majority of miners and their families to survive the strike on handouts, donations from the European "food mountain" and other charities. Being without benefits had more serious consequences for the miners and their families. Their children were not entitled to free school meals or social security help with school uniforms. Poverty and hunger became rife in the mining heartlands. This forced many miners into a dilemma: return to work, and be viewed as a "scab"; or maintain support and live primarily on donations, which is what the majority did.
Notes.
Part of the 'effect' section is copied from UK miners' strike (1984–1985)

After the moshav was evacuated as part of the Camp David Accords, 70 families who had previously lived in the settlement founded a new moshav, also called Netiv HaAsara in the north-western Negev desert in Israel.

<doc id="18268501" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18268501" title="European institutions in Strasbourg">
European institutions in Strasbourg

There are a range of European Institutions in Strasbourg (France), the oldest of which dates back to 1815. In all, there are more than twenty different institutions based in the Alsatian city. Due to this concentration Strasbourg is a claimant to the title of "capital of Europe".
Area.
The European Quarter is spread over an area covering the districts of Wacken, Orangerie and Robertsau in the north-west of the city and comprising the intersection of the River Ill and the Marne-Rhine Canal. The first specific European building in the area was the Council of Europe's House of Europe in 1949, with the Rhine Commission being located towards the centre of the city. The Audiovisual Observatory and the Institute for Human Rights are the only institutions in the quarter to have moved into pre-existing premises: a 1900 villa and an 18th-century former postal relay station and inn turned conventual building, respectively. The Arte headquarters, previously disseminated on several buildings across the town, were united in a single spacious building close to the Louise Weiss building in 2003.
14 November 2007 saw the extension of the Strasbourg tramway into the European Quarter, with the inauguration by European Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering, CoE Secretary general Terry Davis and Eurocorps Lieutenant General Pedro Pitarch of the "Parlement européen", "Droits de l'homme" and "Robertsau Boecklin" tram stations. While the Council of Europe has seen two new buildings being inaugurated in 2006 and 2008, the European Union has constructed no new buildings in Strasbourg since 1999.
In all, there are fourteen different buildings in the European Quarter: eight belonging to the Council of Europe, four belonging to the European Union, plus Arte and the IIHR.
History and institutions.
The first European institution to be based in the city was the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine. Set up in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, it is the oldest international organisation in the world but has only been based in Strasbourg since 1920 (headquarters located in the Palais du Rhin). Its function is to encourage European prosperity by guaranteeing a high level of security for navigation of the Rhine and environs.
However the bulk of the European presence in Strasbourg comes from the post-Second World War establishment of institutions. The move towards European integration pushed for the creation of new bodies. The first of these to be established was the International Commission on Civil Status, founded in 1948 and predating the Council of Europe by a few months. The progressive establishment of a peaceful, unified and prosperous Europe then followed through the founding of the Council of Europe, and its related bodies (such as the European Court of Human Rights), as well as the European Coal and Steel Community (later the European Union). Both the Council of Europe and the European Union increasingly work together, notably to enforce the Council of Europe's European Convention on Human Rights.
One of the main impulses of making Strasbourg into the seat of numerous European institutions came from British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin, one of whose closest advisors had a daughter who had studied in the city. While Bevin publicly acknowledged that the multi-cultural, multi-confessionnal aspect of the city as well as its geographic situation in the heart of (western) Europe were the criteria on which it was chosen, he privately gave a completely different reason: "Strasbourg? Perfect, no one will go there."
Council of Europe.
The Council of Europe has eight buildings in the district; its main building used to be shared with the European Parliament. The first building to be completed was the House of Europe, inaugurated in 1950 but torn down in 1977 when it was replaced by the current Palace of Europe.
The Palace of Europe and the Art Nouveau Villa Schutzenberger (built 1897–1900, seat of the European Audiovisual Observatory) are located in the Orangerie district, the European Youth Centre is located in the Wacken district and the European Court of Human Rights building (built 1989–1995), the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (inaugurated in 2006) and the Agora building (the General Office Building) are situated in the Robertsau district. The Agora building has been voted "best international business center real estate project of 2007" (on 13 March 2008 at MIPIM 2008) and marked the provisional end of new building by the Council of Europe (Agora was officially inaugurated on 17 April 2008 by French minister for Foreign Affairs Bernard Kouchner).
Due to persistent budgetary shortages, the Council of Europe is expected to cut down significantly the number of its activities, and thus the number of its employees, from 2011 on. This will notably affect the economy of the city of Strasbourg.
European Parliament.
The European Parliament has four buildings in the quarter. It previously used the hemicycle of the Council of Europe to hold its meetings until 1999 when it completed its main building, the Louise Weiss building, across the river from the Palace of Europe. It is connected by a bridge to its older office buildings, Pierre Pflimlin, Winston Churchill and Salvador de Madariaga, which are spread out in a broad half circle around the Palace of Europe.
The Salvador de Madariaga building also houses the other EU body of which Strasbourg is the official seat (since 1992): the European Ombudsman.
Controversy.
The location of Parliament has caused some controversy, as its work takes place not only in Strasbourg but also in Brussels and Luxembourg city. The split arrangement has caused financial, environmental and practical difficulties, with the Strasbourg location usually (though not universally) being cited as the extraneous location rather than Brussels.
European studies.
The École nationale d'administration, founded in 1945 in Paris, was moved to Strasbourg by decree in 1991 and permanently established there in 2005 (although the headquarters had been transferred from the start, the students had to spend half of their annual curricula in either city until that date). In the course of its refocusing on European governance, it merged with the Centre d'études européennes de Strasbourg (Center for European Studies, CEES) of the University of Strasbourg and subtitled itself "École européenne de gouvernance" (European Governance School).
Another related academic institution is the Institut des hautes études européennes (IHEE), located in the Art Nouveau former Villa Knopf (built 1903–1905), close to the Parliament and the CoE. This school was founded in 1953 and was then called "Centre universitaire des hautes études européennes" (University Center for higher European Studies).
European school.
The École européenne de Strasbourg has been inaugurated by French education minister Xavier Darcos on 4 September 2008. It is the first school of its kind in France.
Information relays.
Strasbourg also serves as the seat of diverse information relays of the European Union, such as the Information Centre on European Institutions (CIIE), the Euro-Info Centre (EIC), the MEDIA Antenna and the European Documentation Centre (EDC) as well as the European Job Mobility Portal, the EURES network. The city also hosted the automated computerised network Schengen Information System and currently hosts the central unit of its new version, the Schengen Information System II, a back-up unit being located in Austria.
Other bodies.
Other bodies based in the city, most of them unrelated either to the Council of Europe or the European Union but working in more or less close association with them, are: International Commission on Civil Status, Eurocorps (created in 1963), the International Institute of Human Rights (founded in 1969), the European Science Foundation (founded in 1974), the Assembly of European Regions (established in 1985) and the Human Frontier Science Program (conceived in 1986, launched in 1989). Strasbourg is also, since its inception in 1991, the main seat of the Franco-German television channel Arte. Starting from its establishing date on the 1 December 2012, also the new European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA) has his operational HQ in Strasbourg. 
Finally, Strasbourg also hosts the association Apollonia (created in 1998), which defines itself as "a platform of cooperation in the area of the visual arts between European countries and, more specifically, with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the countries along the Baltic Sea and in the South Caucasus." The association was created on the basis of work conducted since 1994 by the Council of Europe within the framework of the Program of European Artistic Exchanges.
Political status.
Twenty institutions have their sole, or one of their main, seats in Strasbourg. Due to this concentration in such a small area, Strasbourg, like Brussels, claims the title of "capital of Europe". While Brussels is the capital city of a trilingual State, Belgium, Strasbourg has had long periods of rule by both France or Germany, assimilating both of their cultures and languages (it also has the Alsatian language). Strasbourg also has the distinction of being one of only three cities to host major international institutions without being a capital (the others being New York City and Geneva).
In Brussels' case, it claims the title through referring to the European Union, while Strasbourg (with the Council of Europe) refers to the continent as a whole. In regards to the European Union, Strasbourg sometimes claims to be the 'democratic' or 'legislative' capital (due to the presence of the Parliament) while classing Brussels as the 'administrative' or 'executive' capital (due to the presence of the European Commission and Council in that city).
In 2005, the urban area of Greater Strasbourg formed a small political community (known as the Strasbourg-Ortenau Eurodistrict) consisting of some common administration with its neighbouring German Ortenau district in Baden-Württemberg on the opposite side of the Rhine. The combined population of this district was 868,000 as of 2006 and there are plans to extend the Strasbourg trams across the Rhine into these areas.
