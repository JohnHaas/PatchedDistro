Pseudoharpax virescens

Pseudoharpax virescens, common name Gambian Spotted-eye Flower Mantis, is a species of praying mantis native to Western, Central and Eastern Africa. 
It takes its name from two eye spots on the dorsal side of the abdomen of adult females. 
Description.
"Pseudoharpax virescens" mimic flowers. They are mostly white with green wings and have pointy eyes. "Pseudoharpax virescens" are small for a mantis, around 3 centimeters in length as adults. 1st instar nymphs are almost 4 millimeters in length. The color of "Pseudoharpax virescens" eyes change night to day. At night their eyes are dark red, during the day their eyes are light green. Oothecae can be 5 millimeters to 15 millimeters long.
Sexual Dimorphism.
Females are usually about 28 millimeters in length, while males are usually about 25 millimeters. Females have short antennae, while males have long and red antennae. Females are bulkier than males. Eight segments can be counted on the underside of the abdomen of a male and six on that of the female. Females have two dots on their abdomens as adults, while males, whose abdomens are thin and covered completely by their wings when looked at from above, appear to have none. 
Subspecies.
There are two subspecies in this species.
Captivity.
These praying mantises are kept and bred in the pet mantis hobby. They are relatively tolerant of different temperatures and humidity levels, a temperature of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit being suitable for these insects.
This mantis breeds rapidly, with females able to lay an ootheca every 3 to 4 days at hight temperature.
"Pseudoharpax virescens" can live together without much cannibalism or maybe none when a reliable food source is present. They are very fast and skittish when they are young nymph, but when they get older, they are rather calm. Adult males are skittish and are strong fliers. "Pseudoharpax virescens" sway sideways in the wind to imitate folliage and they move their antennae back and forth very fast while moving around. They are aggressive predators, with adult females willing to tackle prey as large as themselves. Males are more timid so they need smaller prey items than females will take.

Papillion Junior High

Papillion Junior High is a junior high school in Papillion, Nebraska, which currently holds 7th grade and 8th grade. The school building was opened in 1957 as Papillion High School, which relocated to its present site in north Papillion in August 1971.
Background.
The school is the oldest building in the Papillion-La Vista School District. The school has tornado shelters.
Academics.
The 7th grade student body is divided into teams. The core classes, yearly classes that are not electives, include: Mathematics, Social Studies, English, Science and Reading.
History.
Papillion public schools date back to September 1876. Originally housed in a single brick building at the corner of Halleck & Adams Streets, Papillion's only school served students in all 12 grades. In 1893 the school moved to a new brick building at 420 S. Washington Street (the present site of the district offices.). Papillion continued to grow, and in February 1957, Papillion High School opened in a new building across Washington Street (presently Papillion Jr. High) to students in grades 7-12. The high school moved out of the building to its present site (Papillion-La Vista) in north Papillion in August 1971.
On February 17, 1966 the original Papillion School, built in 1893, was razed to make room for the new junior high school, which was opened in 1967. Nine years later a new junior high was built in neighboring La Vista to help ease crowding at the current school. Before a new high school was open, these two junior highs both enrolled ninth grader students. Currently ninth graders attend both high schools, although more go to Papillion South High School. The school's original boundary was Papio Creek; today it is the city limits.
Athletics.
Papillion Junior High offers football, basketball, wrestling, cross country, track, and volleyball.

Bernardo Huberman

Bernardo Huberman is a Senior Fellow at HP Labs, and Director of the Social Computing Lab at HP Labs. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Pennsylvania, and is currently a Consulting Professor in the Department of Applied Physics and the Symbolic System Program at Stanford University.
Early life and work.
Originally from Argentina, Huberman received his MS at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1966. He received his PhD in Physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1971. He has worked as a visiting scientist at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France and Institute of Theoretical Physics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. He was also a Visiting Professor at the University of Paris, the École Normale Supérieure, in Paris, France, the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the European School of Business, INSEAD in France. He served as a Trustee and Secretary at the Aspen Center for Physics between 1980–1983. 
Huberman originally worked in condensed matter physics, ranging from superionic conductors to two-dimensional superfluids, and made contributions to the theory of critical phenomena in low dimensional systems. He was one of the discoverers of chaos in a number of physical systems, and also established a number of universal properties in nonlinear dynamical systems. His research into the dynamics of complex structures led to the discovery of ultradiffusion in hierarchical systems.
Huberman joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, PARC, where, in the field of information sciences, he predicted the existence of phase transitions in large scale distributed systems, and developed an economics approach to the solution of hard computational problems. He has authored or edited three books about the ecology of computation and the ecology of the web
. 
In 1989 he and colleagues designed and implemented Spawn, a market system for the allocation of resources among machines in computer networks, and a few years later a multiagent thermal market mechanism for the control of building environments. A similar subsequent work at HP Labs called Tycoon received the Horizon Award for Innovation. After working at Xerox PARC, Huberman became a Senior Fellow at HP Labs.
Recent work and recognition.
For several years, Dr. Huberman's research concentrated on the World Wide Web, with particular emphasis the dynamics of its growth and use. With members of his group he discovered a number of strong regularities, such as the dynamics that govern the growth of the web, and the laws that determine how users surf the web and create the observed congestion patterns. 
Presently, Huberman's work centers on the design of novel mechanisms for discovering and aggregating information in distributed systems as well as understanding the dynamics of information in large networks.

Red Apple Rest

The Red Apple Rest was a cafeteria-style restaurant on New York State Route 17, in the Southfields section of Tuxedo, New York. It was a noted way station for people travelling to the hotels of the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York.
Before the New York State Thruway was built, the travel time from New York City to the Catskill Mountains was often four or five hours, especially during weekends. The Red Apple Rest, located almost halfway, became a major roadside stopping place. The restaurant was opened in May 1931 by Reuben Freed.
History.
The Red Apple Rest had much business during the 1940s and 1950s. It was open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, and was patronized by so-called "Borscht Belt" comedians and professional athletes as well as families travelling to campgrounds and resorts. Although the Thruway (which was built beginning 1953) bypassed the restaurant, and vacationing in the Catskill Mountains became less popular after the 1960s, the restaurant remained very busy until the 1970s. In 1965 the Red Apple Rest served one million customers. 
In his book on Jewish comedians in America, "The Haunted Smile", author Lawrence J. Epstein said that comedians would stop at the Red Apple Rest late at night and "would go over the acts, describe the audience, and gather gossip about the other comedians and about routines ripe for buying or 'borrowing.'"
The Red Apple Hotel, which is sited on the hill to the west of the restaurant, was used by performers late into the 1970s. Several Rock and Roll musicians stayed during their bookings in New York City. The location was secluded and the staff was either 'cool about it' or uninformed. Many well known performers roamed through nearby Sterling Forest while waiting to travel to their nighttime venues. One hotel guest that can be named now is George Carlin. Carlin stayed in room 102 during his Saturday Night Live opening week. He required silence during the morning hours to allow for rest, but was very active with the staff during the night. It was common for him to trial material with the night shift desk clerk.
The Red Apple Rest went through several changes of management. It closed in September 2006 - purportedly for a "graduation and vacation," according to a sign posted on the door - and was condemned on January 23, 2007 because of roof damage.
The restaurant was featured in several movies such as Woody Allen's "Deconstructing Harry", "A Walk on the Moon", "Tenderness" and "Oliver's Story", and the November 28, 2013 installment of Bill Griffith's "Zippy".
Possible redevelopment.
On August 25, 2011 the Times Herald-Record ran an article about the town of Tuxedo and a group of British entrepreneurs looking to find a location for a new Ace Eatery. Inspired by a YouTube video, the Red Apple Rest was nominated as a potential place to open a new-eatery meant for bikers. However, Tuxedo town supervisor Peter Dolan mentioned that about 17,000 bikes go through Tuxedo during the summer. However, the building also needs major renovation work and is up against many other possible locations. If the Red Apple Rest is chosen, speculation is the new restaurant will open in 2012.

Princely Academy of Bucharest

The Princely Academy of Bucharest () was an institution of higher education, active from the end of the 17th century to the beginning of the 19th century.
History.
The Academy was founded in 1694, at the initiative of the Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu. It underwent several reorganisations, under Gheorghe Ghica, Constantine Mavrocordatos, Constantin Racoviţă and Alexandru Ipsilanti. The Academy’s language of study was Greek, the universal language of culture in the Eastern Orthodox world. For the most part, the teachers were also Greek. The students of the Academy came from all over the Orthodox world. In 1818 Gheorghe Lazăr began teaching courses in Romanian. In 1821, as a consequence of the increasing activity of the Greek patriotic organization, Filiki Eteria, the Greek-speaking Academy was disestablished, and replaced with a similar institution where teaching was done in Romanian, the Saint Sava Academy.
Organisation and curriculum.
We do not know very much about the Academy’s structure before the reforms of Ipsilanti. From 1776, however, by the decree of Ipsilanti, the studies in the Academy were organised in 5 cycles, each of them lasting 3 years. The first three-year cycle was dedicated to the study of the Greek and Latin grammar. The following was dedicated to the study of Greek, Latin, and classic literature. In the third cycle the students studied poetics, rhetoric, Aristotle’s ethics, Italian and French. In the fourth cycle the arithmetic and the geometry, as well as the history and the geometry were taught. Finally, the last cycle was dedicated to the study of philosophy and astronomy. If at the beginning the teaching was done mostly after the commentaries of Korydaleos to the works of Aristotle, later the courses took a modern orientation. The natural sciences, the philosophy, were taught after occidental handbooks, many of them translated in Greek.

Abraham Falcon

Abraham Falcón García is a Peruvian Luthier who makes classical guitars. He was born on 16 March 1924 in Cora Cora, Ayacucho. Since he was too young, his life was focused on agricultural activities to help all his family.
In 1946, Abraham Falcón made the first "Falcón's guitar", an instrument made of guarango (a piece of dry wood he had found near Palpa's river) It was the beginning of a new hope for all the country: making the best Peruvian guitars.
His company name is ‘Guitarras Falcón’ and nowadays it is located in Lima, Peru. Throughout his 66 year legacy of guitar making, he has achieved several awards including placing 3rd in the World Classical Guitar Luthier Competition in Paris, France in 1987 (XV Rencontres Internacionales de la Guitare) He is considered the most accomplished Peruvian luthier of the 20th century. Falcón's guitars have been used by many renowned Classical guitarists throughout the world as well as Andean and Criollo artists in Peru. Falcón's trademark is in the design of the guitar skeleton which has a unique fan bracing system. As a consecuence, this "research" was registered in INDECOPI as '""Structural Innovation for the Peruvian Classical of Concert Guitar" in 2009. 
On the other hand, all of his concert guitar bodies are made of Indian palisandro, the tops are mostly made of European spruce and the fretboards are made of African ebony . The unique design system combined with his careful selection of the various woods result in exquisitely sounding guitars. The sound quality of his concert guitars have been judged as comparable or better than many guitars made by world renowned Spanish luthiers. Falcón is one of the few quality luthiers in the world that stayed away from becoming a mass producer, and, kept the tradition of making all the guitars himself, by hand. It is hoped that Abraham’s legacy will be passed to his children and that quality guitars will continue to be made in his shop as he ages and is no longer able to work.

History of chromatography

The history of chromatography spans from the mid-19th century to the 21st. Chromatography, literally "color writing", was used—and named— in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant pigments such as chlorophyll (which is green) and carotenoids (which are orange and yellow). New forms of chromatography developed in the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for a wide range of separation processes and chemical analysis tasks, especially in biochemistry.
Precursors.
The earliest use of chromatography—passing a mixture through an inert material to create separation of the solution components based on differential adsorption—is sometimes attributed to German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who in 1855 described the use of paper to analyze dyes. Runge dropped spots of different inorganic chemicals onto circles of filter paper already impregnated with another chemical, and reactions between the different chemicals created unique color patterns. According to historical analysis of L. S. Ettre, however, Runge's work had "nothing to do with chromatography" (and instead should be considered a precursor of chemical spot tests such as the Schiff test).
In the 1860s, Christian Friedrich Schönbein and his student Friedrich Goppelsroeder published the first attempts to study the different rates at which different substances move through filter paper. Schönbein, who thought capillary action (rather than adsorption) was responsible for the movement, called the technique capillary analysis, and Goppelsroeder spent much of his career using capillary analysis to test the movement rates of a wide variety of substances. Unlike modern paper chromatography, capillary analysis used reservoirs of the substance being analyzed, creating overlapping zones of the solution components rather than separate points or bands.
Work on capillary analysis continued, but without much technical development, well into the 20th century. The first significant advances over Goppelsroeder's methods came with the work of Raphael E. Liesegang: in 1927, he placed filter strips in closed containers with atmospheres saturated by solvents, and in 1943 he began using discrete spots of sample adsorbed to filter paper, dipped in pure solvent to achieve separation. This method, essentially identical to modern paper chromatography, was published just before the independent—and far more influential—work of Archer Martin and his collaborators that inaugurated the widespread use of paper chromatography.
Tsvet and column chromatography.
The first true chromatography is usually attributed to the Russian-Italian botanist Mikhail Tsvet. Tsvet applied his observations with filter paper extraction to the new methods of column fractionation that had been developed in the 1890s for separating the components of petroleum. He used a liquid-adsorption column containing calcium carbonate to separate yellow, orange, and green plant pigments (what are known today as xanthophylls, carotenes, and chlorophylls, respectively). The method was described on December 30, 1901 at the 11th Congress of Naturalists and Doctors (XI съезд естествоиспытателей и врачей) in Saint Petersburg. The first printed description was in 1903, in the Proceedings of the Warsaw Society of Naturalists, section of biology. He first used the term "chromatography" in print in 1906 in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, "Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft". In 1907 he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society. Interestingly, Mikhail's surname "Цвет" means "color" in Russian, so there is the possibility that his naming the procedure chromatography (literally "color writing") was a way that he could make sure that he, a commoner in Tsarist Russia, could be immortalized.
In a 1903 lecture (published in 1905), Tsvet also described using filter paper to approximate the properties of living plant fibers in his experiments on plant pigments—a precursor to paper chromatography. He found that he could extract some pigments (such as orange carotenes and yellow xanthophylls) from leaves with non-polar solvents, but others (such as chlorophyll) required polar solvents. He reasoned that chlorophyll was held to the plant tissue by adsorption, and that stronger solvents were necessary to overcome the adsorption. To test this, he applied dissolved pigments to filter paper, allowed the solvent to evaporate, then applied different solvents to see which could extract the pigments from the filter paper. He found the same pattern as from leaf extractions: carotene could be extracted from filter paper using non-polar solvents, but chlorophyll required polar solvents.
Tsvet's work saw little use until the 1930s.
Martin and Synge and partition chromatography.
Chromatography methods changed little after Tsvet's work until the explosion of mid-20th century research in new techniques, particularly thanks to the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge. By "the marrying of two techniques, that of chromatography and that of countercurrent solvent extraction", Martin and Synge developed partition chromatography to separate chemicals with only slight differences in partition coefficients between two liquid solvents. Martin, who had previously been working in vitamin chemistry (including attempts to purify vitamin E), began collaborating with Synge in 1938, bring his experience with equipment design to Synge's project of separating amino acids. After unsuccessful experiments with complex countercurrent extraction machines and liquid-liquid chromatography methods where the liquids move in opposite directions, Martin hit on the idea of using silica gel in columns to hold water stationary while an organic solvent flows through the column. Martin and Synge demonstrated the potential of the methods by separating amino acids marked in the column by the addition of methyl red. In a series of publications beginning in 1941, they described increasingly powerful methods of separating amino acids and other organic chemicals.
In pursuit of better and easier methods of identifying the amino acid constituents of peptides, Martin and Synge turned to other chromatography media as well. A short abstract in 1943 followed by a detailed article in 1944 described the use of filter paper as the stationary phase for performing chromatography on amino acids: paper chromatography. By 1947, Martin, Synge and their collaborators had applied this method (along with Fred Sanger's reagent for identifying N-terminal residues) to determine the pentapeptide sequence of Gramicidin S. These and related paper chromatography methods were also foundational to Fred Sanger's effort to determine the amino acid sequence of insulin.
Refining the techniques.
Martin, in collaboration with Anthony T. James, went on to develop gas chromatography (the principles of which Martin and Synge had laid out in their landmark 1941 paper) beginning in 1949. In 1952, during his lecture for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with Synge, for their earlier chromatography work) Martin announced the successful separation of a wide variety of natural compounds by gas chromatography. (German chemist Fritz Prior had achieved limited success with gas chromatography, separating oxygen and carbon dioxide, in 1947 during his Ph.D. research. The method of Martin and James, however, became the basis for subsequent developments in gas chromatography.)
The ease and efficiency of gas chromatography for separating organic chemicals spurred the rapid adoption of the method, as well as the rapid development of new detection methods for analyzing the output. The thermal conductivity detector, described in 1954 by N. H. Ray, was the foundation for several other methods: the flame ionization detector was described by J. Harley, W. Nel, and V. Pretorius in 1958, and James Lovelock introduced the electron capture detector that year as well. Others introduced mass spectrometers to gas chromatography in the late 1950s.
The work of Martin and Synge also set the stage for high performance liquid chromatography, suggesting that small sorbent particles and pressure could produce fast liquid chromatography techniques. This became widely practical by the late 1960s (and the method was used to separate amino acids as early as 1960).
Thin layer chromatography.
The first developments in thin layer chromatography occurred in the 1940s, and techniques advanced rapidly in the 1950s after the introduction of relatively large plates and relatively stable materials for sorbent layers.
Later developments.
In 1987 Pedro Cuatrecasas and Meir Wilchek were awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine for the invention and development of affinity chromatography and its applications to biomedical sciences.

Monteagle Sunday School Assembly

The Monteagle Sunday School Assembly, or MSSA, is a church. Its Charter, which was granted by the State of Tennessee on October 31, 1882, states the purpose (mission) of the Assembly:
"the advancement of science, literary attainment, Sunday School
"interests, and the promotion of the broadest popular culture in the
"interest of Christianity without regard to sect or denomination. 
Monteagle Sunday School Assembly is inter-denominational and family-oriented. It is dedicated to fulfilling its original charter and mission through a variety of spiritual, educational, cultural, and health development activities for all ages during an eight week season each summer and through retreats and other activities throughout the year.
From the hundreds of such Assemblies patterned after Chautauqua Institution in New York in the late 19th century, only nine or ten remain active today. In 1982, Monteagle Sunday School Assembly celebrated its 100th year of continuous operation and was placed on the National Register of Historical Places by the United States Department of the Interior.
Assembly members represent 23 different states and the District of Columbia. Many belong to fifth-generation families who return each summer to pursue spiritual and intellectual enlightenment, to strengthen family ties, and to engage in Christian fellowship and mission.
Origin.
The MSSA was originally founded in 1882 by the Sunday School Convention of Tennessee, who at the time sought to establish a "Sunday School Congress" in Tennessee; at the time, a number of states had these congresses, often called Assemblies, all of them modelled after the Chautauqua Institution in New York, which is regarded as the first of these Assemblies. They were meant not only as a place for religious activities, such as retreats, but also as places for higher learning at a time when there were few colleges and institutes available to people. The goal of the Assembly was to "combine Sunday School training with a broader program of educational and cultural pursuits". Monteagle Sunday School Assembly was founded as a Chautauqua for the members to grow spiritually and intellectually .
History of operation.
The MSSA opened for its first summer session on July 17, 1883. Although the Assembly began small with only an amphitheater and dining hall, the summer courses offered on the grounds attracted many students and teachers, as most southern schools didn't offer summer programs. The thousands of yearly visitors soon encouraged the Assembly to begin building projects which led to the creation of many cottages, public meeting halls and boarding rooms. In the 20th century, the MSSA, as well as a number of the other Assemblies modeled after Chautauqua, formed the International Chautauqua Alliance. This coalition brought the Assembly even greater popularity, and allowed it to begin showing guest ministers, lectures and entertainers from around the country during the summer season. However, the World Wars and Great Depression severely hindered the revenues and popularity of the MSSA, forcing it to close many cottages and discontinue nearly half their programs; many other Assemblies were forced to shut down during this period. It was nearly 30 years before interest returned to the MSSA, leading to the restoration and refurbishing of many cottages, as well as the introduction of new programs and guest speakers. This reawakening of interest peaked in the 1980s, when the MSSA held its Centennial Celebration and was added to the National Register of Historic Places. To this day, the MSSA is one of only 9 surviving Assemblies in the United States, and still receives thousands of visitors a year.
Summer programs.
The 8-week period from early June to August, referred to as the Season, is when the MSSA hosts its annual summer program. This includes a number of social, spiritual and cultural activities for all ages, as well as guest speakers, entertainers and ministers.
Religious activities.
Often known as the cornerstone of the Assembly program, the number of spiritual activities appeal to Christians of all denominations, and community activities and prayer also help visitors and members get to know each other. The MSSA offers Sunday school and Sunday church, evening prayer Twilight Prayers, and a weekly guest minister and speaker, all of which take place in the Assembly's small but well-known church, Warren Chapel.
Cultural activities.
The Assembly also offers culturally and socially enriching activities during the summer, which can include cottage tours, bazaars, flea markets and guest lecturers, as well as card parties and book clubs offered by the Monteagle Woman's Association.
Youth activities.
By far, the widest range of activities are offered to 5-18 year-olds who come to the Assembly. There is no shortage of things for children and teens to do, and on any given day the Assembly could host evening movies, hiking excursions, youth groups, arts and crafts, and fun.
Guests and members.
Although the MSSA offers popular summer programs, it has many year-round residents who live in the cottages on the grounds. MSSA, located six miles from Sewanee, The University of the South, has been a haven for many writers and artists, including Andrew Lytle and John Gaddis. Only members of MSSA may purchase homes and mortgages are not allowed. Many other people rent out their cottages to people during the summer, and some only stay for a few days at a nearby bed and breakfast.

Elastic interface bus

Elastic interface buses, abbreviated as EI bus connections, can be generalized as bus connections which are high speed interfaces that send clock signals with data. 
Description.
The data bits that are sent through EI bus connections are aligned to the clock so that they latch to the data at the high speeds. EI bus connections require that the net topology and timing characteristics for each net on the bus are at least similar to each other in order to make lining up the edges of the data to the clock signals possible. In this environment, re-working connections in the connection module was not easily possible because all nets needed to have similar topology and timing characteristics. This increased the difficulty of a re-work solution or made it impossible and increased the modules that needed to be scrapped as unusable.
Repair.
Elastic Interface repair involves a spare wire that is built into the bus interface in the connection module that has the same topology and characteristics of the rest of the nets in the bus. It includes hardware that is able to switch from the bad net in the interface to the spare net (as of now, this operation must be supported by the original manufacturer of the EI bus connector). The connection module is tested at several different process corners such as low and high temperature and low and high voltages. When a net on the interface is known to be bad, the spare net is used on the bus for testing and the bad net is not tested. When the bus does not have a defect, the spare net is tested with the functional nets. In the original design specification for the EI spare, the wire was driven with a constant zero when not used.

Garfield statues

Marion, and surrounding Grant County, Indiana have erected a series of statues around the area depicting the comic strip character Garfield. The brainchild of local leader Pete Beck (a county councilman at the time), the basic idea is to place a likeness of Garfield in each community in the county. It is hoped that as the project matures Garfield fans will travel to Grant County and make a circuit to see all of the statues. The statues are made of hollow fiberglass after private fundraising provides for the construction at each location. Indiana native and creator of Garfield, Jim Davis has donated the artwork to create the statues royalty free.
Locations.
First Fairmount, "James Dean Garfield" was unveiled in July 2006. He is dressed in "cool" attire, sporting an open-button collar and denim jeans, placed outside the Fairmount Historical Museum. In tribute to Van Buren, dubbed "the Popcorn Capital of the World", "Popcorn Eating Garfield" was unveiled during the August, 2006 Popcorn Festival. Garfield is dressed in the athletic uniform of the now-defunct Van Buren High School "Aces." In Sweetser, "College-bound Garfield" was unveiled in October 2006; the statue is located along the popular Sweetser Switch Trail after money was raised by the Sweetser Lions Club. This one is in place in front of the train. The status was vandalized when its lower left arm was cut off, but was repaired by summer 2007.
Marion's first statue, "Health and Fitness Garfield" is dressed in running attire sporting the colors of Marion High School and carries a water bottle. It was placed downtown along the Mississinewa River, at the start of the popular River Walk leading to Matter Park, in July 2006. This one was vandalized when a man hugged Garfield too tightly and the head came off. The head was discovered at the Mississinewa Reservoir, and eventually restored to its body. City officials rededicated the repaired statue during Oktoberfest celebrations in 2009. Marion's second statue is Marion General Hospital's "Doctor Garfield" unveiled on May 11, 2007. He is wearing surgical scrubs, holding a stethoscope and resting one foot on a first aid kit. Hospital staff members raised the money for this statue.
The town of Swayzee erected a Garfield statue in June, 2008. "Speedkings Garfield" is dressed ready to hit the courts with the former Swayze High School basketball team. His jersey number 9 represents the number of overtime periods played in the record setting basketball game against Liberty Center in 1964. Garfield stands on Washington Street, near Alumni Park and Swayze Elementary School. The town of Matthews set up "Fisherman Garfield", paying homage to the local river and bridges. The town's statue is placed near the Cumberland Covered Bridge. Plans were to place the statue in August, 2008 and it is now installed (summer 2009).
Fundraising in the town of Jonesboro has produced "Firefighter Garfield", commemorating that Joneboro was the home of the first organized fire department in the county. Town officials hoped to place this statue in Fall, 2009 at 6 W Sixth Street, in front of the fire department. The town of Upland is erecting "Ice Cream Lover Garfield", to be placed near Ivanhoe's Restaurant, 979 S Main Street. The statue, delayed by production problems, has been built and was displayed in the 2009 63rd annual Labor Day parade. It was planned for installation in September, 2009.
Gas City installed "Gas Worker Garfield" complete with a replica of a gas derrick, reminiscent of the natural gas boom at the turn of the 19th Century which made the city . After being in its temporary location inside the Gas City library for more than a year in May 2011 the statue was placed on its permanent mounting in front of the library, at the corner of First and Main Streets.
Although not an official part of the project, in a similar vein Arbor Trace Golf Club commissioned a local chainsaw artist to carve a wooden Garfield statue which has been placed in the clubhouse. "Golfer Garfield" is dressed as a duffer leaning on his driver.

Wesley Pomeroy

Wesley A.C. Pomeroy (January 1, 1920 - May 4, 1998) was an American lawyer, Assistant US Attorney General, Federal Coordinator for the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, Assistant Director of the DEA, and founding member of various humanitarian and policy-making organizations. 
Biography.
Early years.
Pomeroy was born in Burbank, CA. He attended Pacific Union College in the Napa County where he met, and later married, Marjorie Cusick. He began his law enforcement career at the California Highway Patrol as a state trooper. In 1943, he joined the Marines and served in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, he resumed his job as a California Highway Patrol officer. He joined the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office in 1951, where he rose through the ranks to become Undersheriff in 1960. While in this position, he pioneered the department's work-furlough and honor camp facilities, which were the only such programs in the nation at the time. During this time, he also spent his evenings attending law school. He received a law degree from San Francisco Law School and subsequently passed the California bar exam. 
In 1964, he was charged with managing security for the Republican National Convention in the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California. The convention was met with great controversy as there was conflict not only within the Republican Party itself but also from anti-war protesters and civil rights activists. Before this convention, political party conventions were only given cursory security staff unless a former or active president attended, with which Secret Service would be present. Due to several violent and non-violent threats towards the convention, Pomeroy was brought in to manage 18 different police forces providing security to the venue. Due to his diplomatic efforts and management, the convention was successful and not disrupted. Pomeroy continued to serve as a consultant on security for national conventions of both political parties until 1992.
Government career.
His success managing the Republican National Convention drew national attention and in 1967 he was made Coordinator of Federal Law Enforcement. Under Warren Christopher, who was the Deputy Attorney General, he managed the Federal Command Post at the Conrad Hilton hotel overlooking Grant Park in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic Convention. Mayor Richard Daley had requested federal back-up after numerous threats by protesters. After assessing the situation, Pomeroy was frustrated with Mayor Daley's approaches, especially putting officers on 12-hour shifts, as well as being informed that he had no jurisdiction over the Chicago police force. He did have control over the Illinois National Guard and ordered them to replace the Chicago Police Department at various times, including one night in front of the Hilton hotel. Pomeroy is credited to have, despite Mayor Daley's interference, kept the situation from becoming worse than it could have been.
Pomeroy was appointed Assistant Attorney General in 1968 by Ramsey Clark, who was Attorney General in President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. Clark appointed him to help coordinate anti-crime efforts, as well as heading the Federal area of the investigation into Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. During this time he also implemented plans for protecting all of the government buildings in Washington, DC.
Lyndon B. Johnson then appointed Pomeroy as the Republican member to lead the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration along with Patrick V. Murphy and Ralph Liu. He was replaced when Richard Nixon took over as President of the United States in late 1969.
Ramsey Clark later stated after Pomeroy's death, "Wes Pomeroy was a loving and gentle person who worked hard, over the years, to heal the violence in our society. He was one of the few people in law enforcement whose interest and commitment was humanitarian and who understood that security depends finally on love not force." 
Pomeroy returned to public service in 1977 under the Carter administration. He was a consultant on the Drug Abuse Council now part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse before becoming the Assistant Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration. He also served as the Associate Director of the White House Office of Drug Abuse Policy (now the Office of National Drug Control Policy).
Woodstock Festival.
One of the most memorable aspects of Wesley Pomeroy's career was serving as Vice President and Director of Security for the Woodstock Festival of 1969. Despite high-profile bands and almost 500,000 in attendance, there were only 2 confirmed deaths, both of which were accidental. Pomeroy went on to head security for some high-profile bands' US tours, including Led Zeppelin.
He described the problems with such a large festival in an interview with the Redwood City Tribune. "I think I would discourage anyone thinking about putting on another one. When you get that many people together who want to use drugs and take off their clothes, it is impossible to enforce the laws against those things," he was quoted. The last Woodstock concert, in 1999, was shut down early due to violence, rape, fires, and other malicious civil unrest.
Career after government service.
Pomeroy briefly had a criminal justice consulting firm from 1969 to 1971 when he relocated his family from Falls Church, Virginia to Minnesota after taking a job with the University of Minnesota. The Board of Regents appointed Pomeroy as the Director of Safety and Development in 1971. He held this position until 1974 when he resigned to return to traditional law enforcement. Pomeroy moved back to California and served as the Berkeley, CA chief of police. He left this post in 1977 at the request to serve in Jimmy Carter's administration.
After Carter left office, Pomeroy became the deputy director of the Michigan Department of Mental Health. He went on to become an honorary fellow with the American Psychiatric Association, an award seldom given to non-physicians.
Pomeroy assumed the role of Executive Director of the Miami-Dade Independent Review Panel in 1983. He retains the title in emeritus to this day. His service in this capacity was so valued that mandatory ordinances for retirement were suspended twice so that he could continue in this position. After heart bypass surgery, he retired in 1995.
Organizational involvement.
Wesley Pomeroy was a key figure in the creation of prominent organizations and served important advisory roles in others. He was the founder and president of the International Association of the Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (now the National Association of the Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement), was a founder of the Police Executive Research Forum, and a founding member of the International Study of Panetics. He was also a long-time member of the American Civil Liberties Union (where he also previously served on the Board of Directors), National Drug Strategy Network, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (also serving on the advisory board in 1977), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, American Psychiatric Association, the Drug Policy Foundation (where he also served as a director until his death), and the Unrepresented People's Positive Action Council. 
Death.
Wesley Pomeroy died May 4, 1998, aged 78, at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, FL, of complications from heart failure.
He was survived by his second wife, Lonna P. Carroll, three daughters: Nancy Bucher of Palm Springs, CA, Virginia Pomeroy of Germantown, WI, and Victoria Pomeroy of Germantown, TN as well as five grandchildren, four stepchildren and six step-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by one daughter, Patricia Pomeroy.

Richard appeared in 4 total games for the Wolverines in 2004, only attempting 15 passes for 8 completions and 52 total yards.
The following spring, Richard joined the Wolverines baseball team and pitched well. In his one season in Ann Arbor, Richard pitched 21 games, mostly as a reliever and compiled a 0-1 record with a 2.43 ERA, a 1.20 WHIP, and 27 K's in 33.1 IP, good for a 7.29 K/9 innings ratio. The Wolverines were 42-19 that season and finished 4th in the Big 10 with a 17-12 conference record. They were the 3rd seed in the Atlanta Regional of the College Baseball Tournament, but were eliminated in the 2nd round of the Regionals, losing both games to South Carolina by 1 run. After starting his baseball career with moderate success, Richard dropped his football scholarship at Michigan and focused on baseball full-time.
Professional career.
Chicago White Sox.
The White Sox selected Richard in the 8th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. He was the 2nd player from Michigan drafted, the first being Chris Getz, also selected by the Sox in the 4th round.
After playing for the Rookie-level Great Falls White Sox and Class-A Kannapolis Intimidators in 2005, the Intimidators and Class-A Advanced Winston-Salem Warthogs in 2006, the Warthogs in 2007 and the Class-AA Birmingham Barons and Class-AAA Charlotte Knights in 2008, Richard made his major league debut with the White Sox on July 23, 2008.
In 2009, Richard was initially used out of the bullpen, but then moved to the starting rotation on May 12, making 14 starts for the White Sox that year. On July 31, 2009 Richard was traded along with Aaron Poreda, Adam Russell and Dexter Carter to the San Diego Padres for 2007 Cy Young Award-winner Jake Peavy.
San Diego Padres.
Richard made his first start for the Padres on August 1, 2009, recording no decision in 5 innings at home against the Milwaukee Brewers. Richard compiled a 5-2 record with a 4.08 ERA over 12 starts in his partial season with the Padres.
Richard started 33 games for the Padres in 2010, building a 14-9 record and a 3.75 ERA over 201 innings. On September 21, 2010 Richard threw his first career shutout, giving up eight hits, two walks, and recording six strikeouts in a win against the Los Angeles Dodgers along with a golden sombrero at the plate, striking out four times.
In 2011, Richard regressed slightly, posting a 5-9 record with a 3.88 ERA while his strikeout-to-walk ratio dropped to 1.39 K/BB from 1.93 K/BB in 2010. A left shoulder strain forced Richard to the disabled list in July and later required arthroscopic surgery, ending his season.
In 2012, Richard resumed his role in the Padres starting rotation. At the end of the season, he was the unanimous pick as the Padres Pitcher of the Year by writers covering the team. He had a 14-14 record with a 3.99 earned run average. His 33 starts were tied for second in the National League (NL) and he was fourth with innings pitched.
On February 16, 2013, Richard and the Padres avoided going to arbitration, both sides agreeing on a $5.24 million deal for one season.
Richard opened 2013 as the Padres number 2 starter, but had a rough beginning to the season, posting a 8.54 ERA in his first six starts. An intestinal virus forced Richard to push back a start in late April, and he was then placed on the disabled list on May 5 when the virus flared up again. Richard returned on May 27, but continued to struggle. On June 1, Richard pitched 2 innings in relief to earn his first win of the season in a 17 inning affair against the Blue Jays that the Padres won 4-3. On June 21, Richard injured his left shoulder and left the game after making only two pitches. He underwent shoulder surgery on July 15, ending his 2013 season. He finished with a 2-5 record in 11 starts with a 7.01 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 52 innings. On October 28, 2013 he refused an outright assignment and elected free agency.
Playing style.
Richard is a pitch to contact pitcher, inducing groundouts at over a 49% rate through 2012. He also has pitched well at Petco Park, posting an ERA under 3.30 each year from 2010 to 2012.
Richard's pitching repertoire consists of a four-seam and a two-seam fastball (90-92 MPH), a changeup, a slider, and an occasional curveball. Since 2011, he has relied more on his two-seam fastball than his four seam, with this he has induced more than a 50% groundball rate each year since 2011.

Glogovac monastery

Monastery Glogovac (Serbian Cyrillic: манастир Глоговац) is dedicated to Saint George. It is located near the village of Babići, municipality of Šipovo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska entity. It is the only monastery of the Serbian Orthodox Church built in this area. The first building was destroyed in 1463 when this region was occupied by Ottoman Turks.
First reconstruction.
Omer-paša Latas started reconstructing this monastery by building a church in 1867. Bishop Dionisije Milijević put this church into operation in 1869. According to one of the stories, enslaved Serbs asked the Sultan of Turkey to allow them to re-build this holy place. Permission was granted under condition that church bells were not heard. This is the reason the monastery is built between steep hills.
Second reconstruction.
Glogovac is the spiritual focal point for this area. Seventy five years after the monastery was re-built it was destroyed again. This time it was done by the Ustaše and this happened on October 14, 1944. Around 1960, the monastery was sufficiently re-built to be used as a parish church. In 1999, complete reconstruction was started and it was finished in 2005. Left of the main building, work on building St. George’s camp has started. Another project underway is the finishing of a building for pilgrims.

Knock, Knock Who's There?

"Knock, Knock Who's There?", written and composed by John Carter and Geoff Stephens, produced by Mickie Most, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970, performed by the Welsh singer Mary Hopkin.
On 7 March 1970, Mary Hopkin sang six songs at the UK National Final, "A Song for Europe", which was aired on the television series "It's Cliff Richard!". Hopkin was chosen by the BBC to be the United Kingdom's representative for that year, and the winner of a postal vote would determine which of the six songs would progress with her to the finals in Amsterdam. "Knock, Knock Who's There?", the sixth and final song performed that evening, won the postal vote with over 120,000 supporters.
At Amsterdam, the song was performed seventh on the night, after France's Guy Bonnet with "Marie-Blanche", and before Luxembourg's David Alexandre Winter with "Je suis tombé du ciel." At the end of judging that evening, "Knock, Knock Who's There?" took the second-place slot with 26 points. The UK received points from nine out of a possible eleven voting juries.
The singer expresses a long-held optimism at the prospect of love finally finding her. At the exact point that said optimism has faded, and she has resigned herself to not finding love and companionship, she hears a "knock, knock," which signifies love finally becoming attainable for her. Excited, she beckons love to "come inside" and into her life.
On 28 March 1970, Hopkin's "Knock, Knock Who's There" peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart; it would be a chart fixture for 14 weeks. It wasn't released in the United States as a single until November 1972, where it floundered for four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, only reaching a peak of #92. In the Netherlands it peaked at #3 on the Dutch Top 40 as well as on the Single Top 100.
In 1970, a sound-alike cover appeared on the album Top of the Pops, Volume 10.
Liv Maessen's Cover.
In Australia, a cover version by Liv Maessen co-charted into the top 10. Maessen's version reached #2 on the Australian charts, after her debut single "The Love Moth" only made it to #40.
Other versions.
Also in 1970 Edina Pop reached #35 in Germany with the rendering "Komm, Komm Zu Mir" while Kristina Hautala recorded the Finnish rendering "Kop Kop, Ken Lie".
In 1971, Hong Kong female singer/artist Sum Sum (森森) covered this song in Mandarin Chinese language with Chinese lyrics written by Di Yi (狄薏) and given the title name of 我情願你惱恨我, appearing on her LP album "一寸相思一寸淚 (Bitter Love In Tears)", and released by EMI Regal Records
There was also a cover in Dutch.

SB-242,084

SB-242,084 is a psychoactive drug and research chemical which acts as a selective antagonist for the 5HT2C receptor. It has anxiolytic effects, and enhances dopamine signalling in the limbic system, as well as having complex effects on the dopamine release produced by cocaine, increasing it in some brain regions but reducing it in others. It has been shown to increase the effectiveness of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressants, and may also reduce their side effects. In animal studies, SB-242,084 produced stimulant-type activity and reinforcing effects, somewhat similar to but much weaker than cocaine or amphetamines.

Princely Academy of Iași

The Princely Academy of Iași was an institution of higher learning, active in the 18th and 19th centuries.
History.
Founded in Iași (capital of the Principality of Moldavia) by the Prince Antioh Cantemir in 1707, the Academy symbolically continued the Academia Vasiliană, although no direct link exists between the two similar institutions. The main reformer of the Academy was Grigore III Ghica (1776), who modernised it as to compete with the European universities. The studies were done in Greek, and for the better part of the 18th century they were basically Aristotelian. Beginning with the 1760s a series of enlightened directors introduced into the Academy the study of mathematics, natural sciences and modern philosophy, translating and adapting European handbooks. In 1814 Gheorghe Asachi lectured for the first time in Romanian at the Academy, training a class of engineers, until 1819. In 1821 the Academy was disestablished by order of the Sultan, following the activity of the Greek patriotic organization, Filiki Eteria. Political circumstances caused that another Academy did not exist until 1835, when the Mihaileana Academy was established. The new institution had some professors from the ancient one, so that we can trace a direct lineage between the two Academies. The Princely Academy did not offer standard academic degrees, but only diplomas that certified that the possessor was worthy of “the name of learned man”. This name gave to the bearer the possibility to hold diverse administrative offices within the Ottoman Empire and Romanian Principalities.

Pierre Abraham Lorillard

Pierre Abraham Lorillard (17421776) was a tobacconist of New York City. He founded the business which developed into the Lorillard Tobacco Company, which claims to be the oldest tobacco firm in the United States and in the world. His name is also sometimes given as Peter Abraham Lorillard, Peter Lorillard and Pierre Lorillard I.
Life.
The son of Jean Lorillard (born 1707) and his wife Anne Catherine Rossel, Lorillard set out in business in about 1760 with a snuff-grinding factory in a rented house on Chatham Street, now Park Row, in Lower Manhattan. He was the first man to make snuff in North America. According to Maxwell Fox's "The Lorillard Story" (1947), Lorillard adopted the trademark of a native American smoking a pipe, standing beside a hogshead of tobacco, which "later became the best known trademark in the world".
The naturalization recorded in New York on April 21, 1762, of 'Peter Louillard', a stocking weaver and French Protestant, is probably that of Lorillard. This followed the naturalization on October 27, 1760, of John George Lorillard, described as a French Protestant yeoman of New York City. 
Lorillard died in 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, killed by Hessian mercenaries of the British during the British occupation of New York City, but after his death his business was carried on by his descendants and grew into the Lorillard Tobacco Company. In 1960, the company issued a 'Bicentennial Report' in which it was able to boast proudly that "P. Lorillard Company is older than the United States, taking its origin in the Colonial days of 1760 when British kings ruled the land... Lorillard is the oldest tobacco company in the world".
Lorillard had five brothers, Jean George, George David, Charles Christophe, Jean Abraham, and Leopold Frederick, and a sister, 
Anne Marguerite.
Wife and children.
Lorillard married Catherine Moore, and they lived at Hackensack, New Jersey. They had at least five children:
Peter Lorillard and Catherine Moore (sister of Blazius Moore) obtained a marriage license on August 19, 1763, when another marriage license was granted to John Lorillard and Hannah Moore, suggesting that Hannah and Catherine may have been sisters. 
The register of the French church of New York City gives the date of Lorillard's marriage, as well as that of Jean (John) and Anne Moore: "August 23, 1763 married by license Pierre l'Oreillard and Catherine Moore in presence of the families l'Aureillard and Moore. The same day married by license in the house of M. Parptre in the Bowery rented by Sieur Moore Jean l'Aurellard and Anne Moore in the presence of the families l'Aurellard and Moore.
After Lorillard's death, his widow married as her second husband a man named John Holsman or Daniel Holtzman. Lorillard's sons George and Peter (or Pierre) took over his business in 1792, while his son Jacob became a banker and philanthropist in New York City. According to Rex Burns, "Jacob Lorillard was justified in his wealth, first because he rose from being an obscure tobacconist's apprentice by his own integrity, industry, perseverance, and love of books, and secondly, because when he was a millionaire, his moral pursuit of wealth led him to exhibit benevolence and generosity."

<doc id="18519306" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18519306" title="Geneviève Dieudonné">
Geneviève Dieudonné

Geneviève Dieudonné is a character appearing in a number of works by Kim Newman.
Overview.
According to Newman, there are three versions of Geneviève, one for each series (Warhammer Fantasy, "Anno Dracula", and "The Diogenes Club"). Each has a different middle name but each is a "trans-continual cousin". All of them share a number of similar features, however: she is a beautiful blonde female vampire from Brittany (or its otherworldly equivalent), turned by the vampire elder Chandagnac when she was 16. Although she is around 400 years old by the time the stories with her are set, she still resembles a 16-year-old girl. According to Newman, her first name comes from a woman he once knew, while her last name comes from Albert Dieudonné.
Variants.
Warhammer Fantasy.
Genevieve Sandrine du Pointe du Lac Dieudonné originally appeared in the 1989 Warhammer Fantasy novel "Drachenfels", written under Newman's pen name Jack Yeovil. She later appeared in the novel "Beasts in Velvet", several short stories collected in "Genevieve Undead" and "Silver Nails", and the complete collection, "The Vampire Genevieve". According to Newman, "the reason she doesn't have an accent on her name in GW books is that word-processing/printing techniques were so primitive back then that putting in accents was a major pain and used only on special occasions, like when listing her last name, Dieudonné."
In the fictional setting of Warhammer Fantasy, Genèvieve was born in Bretonnia in the year 1839 of the Imperial Calendar. She was given the Dark Kiss by Chandagnac in 1855, and traveled with him for some time. Their destinations included the Empire, Cathay (where she studied magic and martial arts), and Araby (where she was a slave). After Chandagnac's death, she worked at a vampire tavern for a century, before joining a band of adventurers. During this time and afterward, she became a mercenary, spy, a convent-dweller, an actress (for a single show) playing herself, a wanderer, and an assassin. After foiling a plot to start a war between vampires and humans, she settled down and married her lover, the playwright Detlef Sierck.
Newman has stated that Genevieve is one of the most popular characters of Warhammer Fantasy and that "a lot of girls were taken with Genevieve as an unusual, non-princessy identification figure (all the Jack Yeovil books have action heroines with Marvel Comics-style 'problems' beyond beating up the next bad guy)."
Anno Dracula.
Geneviève Sandrine d'Isle Dieudonné is a major character in the first novel in Newman's "Anno Dracula" series, "Anno Dracula". The "Anno Dracula" series combines characters and situations from numerous different works of fiction and Newman credited himself as Jack Yeovil in the back of the book.
Her fictional background is gradually revealed throughout the series. She was born in 1416 Brittany. Her father was a doctor, and she learned much from his trade. Disguised as a boy, she fought for Joan of Arc; in 1432, after her death, she was given the Dark Kiss by Chandagnac. In the following years, she had a variety of occupations, including nurse, courtesan, slave, and soldier, once more disguising herself as a male to fight under both Francis Drake against the Spanish Armada and Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia. She was a good friend and implied lover of Carmilla Karnstein.
In 1888 (during the events of "Anno Dracula"), several years after Count Dracula takes over Britain, Geneviève helps Diogenes Club agent Charles Beauregard hunt down the vampire-killer known as "Silver Knife", who is eventually revealed to be Jack Seward, who she had worked with at Toynbee Hall. Shortly after, she helps Beauregard, whom she has become a lover with, assassinate Queen Victoria on orders of Mycroft Holmes, thus dissolving Dracula's claim to the British throne. In the sequel, "The Bloody Red Baron", Geneviève is absent; according to Newman, this was because she "was becoming too strong a character for her own good" and it allowed him to build up another character, Kate Reed, in her stead. She is mentioned often in the book, however, and is said to have moved to an orange farm in California (which, from later works, would make her one of the first vampires in California, much less the United States). However, she returns as a main character in the third (and so far final) book in the series, "Dracula Cha Cha Cha", where in 1959 she has to cope with the deaths of both Dracula and her lover Beauregard. According to Newman, he brought her back because he realized her story still was not finished.
However, she appears in several of the short stories set afterwards. In the 1970s, under the name "Gené Dee", she becomes a private investigator after assisting Philip Marlowe in a case, although she finally retires from the business after a 1981 investigation involving Orson Welles and a cheerleader called "Barbie the Vampire Slayer". Her further exploits are unknown, although she will presumably appear in the upcoming fourth novel, "Johnny Alucard". According to Newman, he still has plans for her as of May, 2008.
A devout Roman Catholic, she spent much of her early life wondering if she truly was damned as her priest had stated, but later learned to ignore and outgrow such self-destructive sentiments. However, she is still very conscious of her responsibilities, and refused to pass along the Dark Kiss in almost all situations. She was also a forward-thinking and imaginative person, harboring an interest in horror, science fiction, alternate history, and dystopian fiction. She read "Napoleon and the Conquest of the World", "Dracula", "Big Brother", "I Am Legend", and "On the Beach" when they came out, and for a time wished to be an astronaut after reading works of Arthur C. Clarke.
In a proposed "Anno Dracula" movie, Newman had hoped to cast first Isabelle Adjani, and then Juliette Binoche as Geneviève.
The Diogenes Club.
Genèvieve Sandrine Ysolde Dieudonné, also known as "Jennifer Dee" and "Geneva Deodati", has appeared in a number of Newman's Diogenes Club books and short stories, along with several "Anno Dracula" characters including Beauregard, Edwin Winthrop, and Catriona Kaye. Although she is reticent about her past, it presumably resembles that of her "Anno Dracula" counterpart up to the late 19th century, where Dracula's invasion of England succeeded in the "Anno Dracula" timeline and failed (if it occurred at all) in the main Diogenes Club timeline. In this timeline, she remained in England throughout the 20th century, doing occasional work with the Diogenes Club. It is mentioned by the Undertaking that she was excommunicated in 1638 by the Roman Inquisition.
This version of Genèvieve appears in the short story "The Big Fish", battling Lovecraftian menaces alongside Edwin Winthrop during World War II; four stories in the "Seven Stars" sequence ("The Trouble with Barrymore", a sequel to "The Big Fish"; "The Biafran Bank Manager"; "The Dog Story"; and "The Duel of Seven Stars"); and in the short story "Cold Snap", featuring 1970s Diogenes Club agent Richard Jeperson. She is a major character in "Sorceror Conjurer Wizard Witch", which depicts her first meeting with Beauregard in the Diogenes Club timeline.
Other.
Geneviève Dieudonné is briefly mentioned in "In the Air", the first segment of Newman and Eugene Byrne's alternate history work "Back in the USSA". In it, she is a schoolgirl around sixteen years old in a 1951 Kansas that is part of the United Socialist States of America, and has a love song written for her. She is presumably not a vampire in this universe, and it is unexplained how a girl in a poor town in Soviet Kansas had a French name.
In Newman's short story "The Mark of Kane", collected in "", Geneviève is briefly mentioned as one of the former agents of the "Angels of Music", a "Charlie's Angels"-type private detective agency run by Monsieur Erik out of the Paris Opera.

Government College of Engineering &amp; Textile Technology, Berhampore

The Government College of Engineering & Textile Technology Berhampore (previously known as the College of Textile Technology Berhampore) is a college of West Bengal University of Technology in Berhampore, West Bengal, India. It is a residential and co-educational institute. Admission for undergraduate students is through the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination. This college is selected for TEQIP (Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme), Phase II.
Location and control.
Government College of Engineering & Textile Technology, Berhampore is situated in Berhampore, in Murshidabad district of West Bengal. Recognised by the Department of Higher Education, it is under direct administrative control of the Government of West Bengal.
History.
The college was established in the central jail premises at Berhampore on 19 July 1927 as the Government Silk Weaving and Dyeing Institute to train local artisans engaged in silk production and silk weaving in Murshidabad district under the administrative control of the Directorate of Industries, Government of West Bengal.
The institute was moved to its present location at 4 Barrack Square (East) during 1932–33. The college was upgraded in 1940 and renamed Bengal Technological Institute with the introduction of a 3-year diploma course (licentiate) in Textile Technology and a 2-year artisan course. Given the general nature of the course, the college was renamed the Berhampore Textile Institute in 1950.
In 1958 the college was upgraded to the level of a degree college with modernisation of the syllabus, workshop and laboratories. A three-year B.Sc. (Tech.) degree course in Textile Technology affiliated to the University of Calcutta was introduced and the name changed again to College of Textile Technology. In 1963, a four-year B.Sc. (Tech.) degree course was started. The college was subsequently brought under the administrative control of the Directorate of Technical Education in 1972.
In 1990, the college was transferred to the University of Kalyani. The B.Sc. (Tech.) degree was changed to a B.Tech. in 1998 in line with AICTE's wish to bring parity with other engineering degrees in India.

Sahibzada Abdul Latif

Syed Abdul Latif (1853 – July 14, 1903) or Sahibzada Abdul Latif among the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was the Royal Advisor to Abdur Rahman Khan and Habibullah Khan, the father and son kings of Afghanistan between the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is believed that Abdul Latif helped King Abdur Rahman Khan during the negotiation of the Durand Line Agreement with the British India in 1893. It is also believed that in 1902 he became a follower of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, Punjab.
Background.
Abdul Latif was born in a village called "Sayed Ga" in what is now Khost Province of Afghanistan It is claimed that through his father, Sahibzada Mohammad Sharif, he is a descendant of Ali Hujwiri, a scholar during the 11th century who is buried in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan Some referred to Abdul Latif by the title "Raees-e-Kabul". He had thousands of pupils all over Afghanistan and students came to him from far regions of Central Asia
He was a learned man, fluent in Persian, Pashto, and Arabic. It is also claimed that he owned a large piece of land in Khost Province. Abdul Latif is often called the "Sayyed-ul-Shuhada" (leader of the Martyrs) within the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. He had visited Hoshiarpur, and frequented Deoband Markaz in Hyderabad, India.
Abdul Latif was an eminent member of the Ulama of Afghanistan. He had great influence on the Afghan kings and its darbar; as claimed by Zahoor Ahmad, he had the honour to place the Amir's crown on the head of Habibullah Khan himself on the eve of his coronation in 1901.
At the time when the British were attempting to set the limit of King Abdur Rahman Khan's political sphere of influence, Abdul Latif and Sardar Shireendil Khan were chosen to represent the Afghan side.
In 1889 Abdul Latif heard about Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, British India, who claimed to be the Promised Messiah and Imam Mahdi. He sent one of his pupils, Maulvi Abdur Rahman, to British India on a secret mission. Abdur Rahman returned after having accepted Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, and joining the Ahmadiyya movement, bringing with him some books written by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad for him to read. After Abdul Latif read one of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's books, he joined the Ahmadiyya movement.
Death and legacy.
In 1902, Abdul Latif asked Habibullah Khan for permission to make pilgrimage to Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The King granted him permission and even presented him with a reasonable sum for his expenses. Abdul Latif reached Lahore in October 1902 accompanied by some of his pupils. On arrival, he discovered that a plague had spread in India and the Ottoman Government had imposed restrictions on people coming from British India. Instead of going for Hajj as he told the king he would do, Abdul Latif decided to visit British India to meet Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He publicly announced his allegiance to the Ahmadiyya movement, offering Bay'ah to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in Qadian.
Afghanistan was a very conservative country, similar to that of Saudi Arabia, and doing what Abdul Latif did, according to Afghan law of the time which was strictly based on Islamic Sharia, it was considered apostasy in Islam. When the news spread that Abdul Latif is a follower of the new Ahmadiyya movement, Habibullah Khan, on the order of religious clerics, charged him with apostasy which carried the death penalty in Afghanistan. On 14 July 1903, Abdul Latif was sentenced to death after it was learned that he was mentally fit and that he willingly became a follower of the Ahmadiyya movement. It is believed that he did not surrender his beliefs for the Afghan government, although he was asked multiple times that if he denied Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he would not be executed. It is claimed that Abdul Latif replied in response "I am carrying the chains, shackles and handcuffs for the sake of the prophet Muhammad and to me they are like ornaments. I am walking briskly because I am impatient for a rendezvous with my Master. Thereafter, the Afghan government carried on with his execution. 
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community claim that he was buried half underground and stoned to death, which was the common form of execution at the time. According to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, he is the first recognized martyr for its cause. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad has written books on him and his stoning. It is reported that a total of about 3 Ahmadiyya Muslims executions were carried out in Kabul between 1901 and 1924. Since then, no more Ahmadiyya Muslims have been reported in Afghanistan, but a possibility of their existence remains.

Vagharshapat

Vagharshapat (), commonly known as Ejmiatsin or Echmiadzin (), is the fourth-largest city in Armenia, one of the historic capitals of Armenia and the spiritual center of the Armenians, as it is the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is the most populous city in Armavir province, located about west of Yerevan, east of the regional center of Armavir, only north of the Armenian-Turkish border. The official census in 1989, counted the population of Ejmiatsin as 61,000. However, the number has declined somewhat since, showing 58,388 in the 2001 census, and 57,600 in the 2011 official estimate.
Etymology and history.
Early history.
The territory of ancient Vagharshapat was inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. Many sites, such as Metsamor, Shresh hill and Mokhrablur date to the neolithic period. The first written records about Vagharshapat were found in the inscriptions left by the Araratian king Rusa II (685–645 BC), where it was mentioned as "Kuarlini"' (). The inscription found in the archaeological site of ancient Vagharshapat cites to a water canal opened by king Rusa II, between Ildaruni river (Hrazdan River) and the valley of Kuarlini.
According to Moses of Chorene, the oldest name of Vagharshapat was probably Artimed (), derived from the ancient Greek deity Artemis. It was renamed Avan Vardgesi () (Town of Vardges) or Vardgesavan () after being rebuilt near the shores of Kasagh River, by the efforts of prince "Vardges Manouk", during the reign of king Orontes I Sakavakyats of Armenia (570–560 BC).
Under the reign of king Tigranes the Great (95-45 BC), the town was partly inhabited by Jewish captives.
In the first half of the 1st century AD, under the reign of the Armenian Arsacid king Vagharsh I of Armenia (117–144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed Vagharshapat (). In his first book "Wars of Justinian", the Byzantine historian Procopius has cited to the city as Valashabad (Balashabad), named after king Valash (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial "L" into a "Gh", which is common in the Armenian language. Moses of Chorene mentioned that the Town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by king Vagharsh I to become known as Noarakaghak () (meaning the New City) or Vagharshapat.
Vagharshapat has served as the capital of the Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia between 120 AD and 330 AD. After embracing Christianity as a state religion in Armenia in 301, Vagharshapat was gradually called Ejmiatsin (), after the name of the Mother Cathedral; the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate, which is considered as one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. As a spiritual centre of the entire Armenian nation, Vagharshapat has grew up rapidly and developed as an important centre of education and culture. The city was home to one of the oldest educational institutions in Armenia founded by Mesrop Mashtots.
The political capital of the Armenian kingdom was transferred to the city of Dvin in 336. Vaghasrhapat maintained its status as the country's most important city until the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom in 428. The city has gradually lost its importance under the Persian rule, specifically when the seat of the Catholicosate was transferred to Dvin in 452. However, the first manuscripts library in Armenia was founded in 480 in Vagharshapat.
In 491, Catholicos Babken I of Armena, along with the Albanian and Iberian bishops met in Vagharshapat and issued a condemnation of the Chalcedonian Definition.
Foreign rule.
In 658 AD, Vagharshapat, along with the rest of the Ancient Armenian Highland, was conquered by the Arabs.
The city was briefly revived between the 9th and 11th centuries under the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia, before being overrun by the Byzantines in 1045 and later by the Seljuqs in 1064. In the middle of the 13th century, Vagharshapat became part of the Ilkhanate of the Mongol Empire. After the invasion of Tamerlane in 1387, the city fell under the rule of the Timurid dynasty. In 1410, Armenia came under the rule of the Kara Koyunlu Turkomans until 1468 when the Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans ruled the Armenian territories until 1502. Under the Turkic-Mongol rule, the city was known to the Turks as Uchkilisa (Üçkilise, "three churches" in Turkic).
During the long period of the foreign rules started from 1045, Vagharshapat turned into an insignificant city until 1441, when the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate was transferred from the Cilician city of Sis back to Etchmiadzin.
Between 1502 and 1828, Armenia became part of the Persian state under the rule of Safaavid, Afsharid and Qajar dynasties, with short periods of Ottoman rule between 1578 and 1603 and later between 1722 and 1736.
In 1828, after the Russo-Persian War, Vaghasrhapat — as a part of the Erivan Khanate — was handed over to the Russian Empire as a result of the Treaty of Turkmenchay signed on 21 February 1828.
Soviet rule and independence in 1991.
Armenia enjoyed a short period of independence between 1918 and 1920 before falling to the Bolshevik 11th Red Army and becoming part of the Soviet Union.
In 1925, the new plan of rebuilding the modern town was introduced by architect Alexander Tamanian. It was finally completed between 1939 and 1943. In 1945, the town of Vagharshapat was officially renamed Etchmiadzin by the Soviet government.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the town has witnessed a massive wave of construction, including residential buildings and industrial plants. By the end of the 1960s, the historical monuments of the town; including the religious complex of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, Saint Hripsime Church, Saint Gayane Church and the surrounding area of Zvartnots Cathedral, were entirely rehabilitated.
After the independence of Armenia, the town was officially renamed Vagharshapat in 1995. However, the town is still popularly known as Ejmiatsin.
Geography and Climate.
Vagharshapat is the largest satellite-city of Yerevan and the 4th largest in Armenia by population. Its is located to the east of Yerevan in the basin of Kasagh River, in the northeastern extremity of Ararat plain. It is very close to the Zvartnots International Airport.
According to Moses of Chorene's "History of Armenia" and as a result of several archaeological researches conducted in the area, the most probable location of the ancient city of Vagharshapat is the area of "Shresh Hill" near Kasagh River.
"Shresh Hill" or the "Kond of Ghugo", as it was called by the local population, is only 500 meters away to the northeast of modern-day Vaghasrhapat, on the way to Oshakan. It is an artificial hill and has a diameter of 123 meters long. It was first excavated in 1870. In 1913 and 1928, the area was excavated by archaeologist Yervand Lalayan. Large-scale excavations were conducted around the hill and the nearby sites of Metsamor and Mokhrablur between 1945 and 1950.
Historically, Vagharshapat is at the heart of the Armenian Highland, in Aragatsotn canton (Armenian: Արագածոտն գաւառ "Aragatsotn gavar", not to be confused with the current Aragatsotn Province) of Ayrarat province, within Armenia Major.
The city has an average elevation of above sea level with a dry continental climate.
Landmarks.
Etchmiadzin Cathedral.
Historically, the focal point of the town is the Mother Cathedral of Holy Etchmiadzin, ( "Mayr Tachar Surp Ejmiatsin") which is one of the oldest churches in the world. Originally known as the Holy Mother of God Church ( "Surp Astvatsatsin Yekeghetsi"), it was first built by Saint Gregory the Illuminator as a vaulted basilica in 301–303, when Armenia had just adopted Christianity as a state religion (the first such in world history). The church was enlarged in many occasions, notably in 480, 618 and 1658.
The religious complex of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin.
The Mother Cathedral is found in the complex of Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin (), the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the worldwide Armenian Apostolic Church and the Pontifical Residence of the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians.

Most buildings are of great architectural significance, such as the old and new Pontifical Residences, the Chancellery or the "Divanatoon", the Gate of King Trdat, Alex and Marie Manoogian Treasury Museum (1982), Khrimian Museum, Yeremian Monastic cells, the old Seminary building, the Clock Tower, the Bookstore, etc.
Gevorkian Seminary is a theological college of the Armenian Apostolic Church founded by Catholicos Gevork IV in 1874 within the complex of the Mother See.
Apart from the Mother Cathedral, Vagharshapat is home to many other important Armenian churches and cathedrals. The Cathedral of Etchmiadzin, the Churches of Saint Hripsimé, Saint Gayane and Saint Shoghakat, and the archaeological site of Zvartnots are listed among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Saint Hripsimé Church.
Built in 618, the Church of Saint Hripsimé has basically survived almost unchanged. It is considered one of the oldest surviving churches in Armenia, known for its fine architecture of the classical period, which influenced many other Armenian churches. It was erected in 618 by Catholicos Gomidas atop the original mausoleum, built by Catholicos Sahak the Great in 395, which contained the remains of the martyred Saint Hripsimé. According to the 17th century Armenian historian Arakel of Tabriz, the church was renovated during 1651–1653 by Catholicos Philip I. Repairs were made on the roof, top of the dome, the walls and bases. A cross was placed on top of the roof, and a small portico was added to the western side. It is one of the few churches in Armenian that remained active during the Soviet period.
Saint Gayane Church.
Built in 630 by Catholicos Ezra I, Saint Gayane Church is distinguished by its harmonious proportions. It is a three-nave domed basilica with an octagonal drum resting on four internal pillars that divide the interior of the church into three. Its design remained unchanged despite partial renovations of the dome and some ceilings in 1652.
Zvartnots Cathedral.
Zvartnots is a 7th-century ruined circular Armenian cathedral built by the order of Catholicos Nerses III the Builder between 641 and 653. It is at the eastern edge of modern-day Vagharshapat.
Zvartnots was a majestic cathedral famous for its unique design, dedicated to Saint George, built at the place where a meeting between king Tiridates III and Saint Gregory the Illuminator was supposed to have taken place.
In 930 AD, the church was ruined by an earthquake and remained buried until it was rediscovered in the early 20th century by architect Toros Toramanian. The site was excavated between 1900 and 1907, uncovering the foundations of the cathedral as well as the remains of the Pontifical palace and a winery.
Saint Shoghakat Church.
Meaning 'the drop of light', Shoghakat Church is a single-nave domed basilica, built and completed in 1694 by prince Aghamal Sorotetsi during the period of Catholicos Nahabed I. It is built with red and black tufa stones, erected on the remains of a 6th-century basilica. The remains of a 4th-century small chapel could be seen at the southwestern end of Saint Shoghakat Church.
Holy Mother of God Cathedral.
The Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God in Vagharshapat was built in 1767, during the period of Catholicos Simeon I. It is located north of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, at the centre of modern-day Vagharshapat. It was built on the remains of a 16th-century wooden church.

Nevele Grand Hotel

The Nevele Grande Hotel was a high rise resort hotel located in the Town of Wawarsing, just outside of Ellenville, New York, that closed its doors in 2009. The Nevele (NEV-uh-lee) dated back to the days of the Borscht Belt, opening in 1903. “Nevele” is “Eleven” spelled backwards — according to lore, after the eleven nineteenth-century schoolteachers who discovered a waterfall within its present-day property. Its property included a once highly regarded 18-hole golf course and a 9-hole golf course which are also closed and have fallen into disrepair.
Originally named simply Nevele, the resort was renamed the Nevele Grande when it merged with the adjacent Fallsview resort after the Nevele was sold by the original owners in 1997. President Lyndon B. Johnson once stayed at the Nevele, to dedicate a new hospital in Ellenville in 1966. By 2006 the Nevele Grande had fallen on hard times and the Fallsview property was sold off. The Fallsview has since reopened as the Honors Haven Resort and Spa. The original Nevele property, containing a distinctive high rise building, remained open for several years after the split as the Nevele Grande resort. Owners Mitchell Wolff and Joel Hoffman struggled financially and failed to pay taxes and eventually shut down the resort down without notice after the 2009 Fourth of July weekend. 
On September 1, 2009, an auction of the property was canceled the day before it was to occur because a buyer was allegedly found. However, by the time the auction was scheduled the property had fallen into a state of disrepair, including "musty staircases and rooms, big and small, with odd smells wafting out of them.". The hotel remained unsold months later, although Hoffman was still attempting to generate revenue with a deal to sell timber on of property. He also renewed an agreement to let Nextel put cell phone antennas atop one of the hotel's buildings.
On March 26, 2010, New York State Supreme Court Judge Mary Work granted Wolff ownership of the hotel in light of Hoffman's failure to pay Wolff an earlier $2m judgment. The initial dispute arose when Wolff sold Hoffman 99% control of the hotel in exchange for lifetime health benefits, a deal on which Hoffman almost immediately reneged. Judge Work described Hoffman's mismanagement of the hotel "staggering," and upbraided him in court for failure to be forthcoming.
In May 2012, Nevele Investors LLC, a subsidiary of Claremont Partners Ltd., which had purchased the resort, announced that the Nevele Grande would undergo a $500 million redevelopment to turn it into a resort and casino, subject to approval of state legislation to allow casino gaming. The 1966 tower and entrance lobby, ice skating rink, and golf course would be retained in the new complex.

Jannik Petersen Bjerrum

Jannik Petersen Bjerrum (December 26, 1851 – 1920) was a Danish ophthalmologist who was a native of Skærbæk, a town in the southernmost part of Jutland. In 1864 Skærbæk became part of Germany due to consequences of the Second Schleswig War. 
In 1876 he received his medical doctorate from the University of Copenhagen, and in 1879 became an assistant to Edmund Hansen Grut (1831-1907) at the Havnegade eye clinic. After Grut's retirement in 1896, he became director of the clinic, as well as being the second professor of ophthalmology at the University of Copenhagen, a position he would maintain until his retirement in 1910.
Bjerrum made contributions regarding pathogenetic research of glaucoma, and performed extensive investigations involving campimetry. He was interested in the correlation between visual perception of form and the resolving power in localized regions of the retina. He was particularly focused on the subtleties of the central 30° of the visual field rather than the standard perimetry tests that many of his contemporaries favored. 
As a result of his campimetric tests he discovered a small glaucomatous scotoma that was to become known as a "Bjerrum scotoma", which is a visual field defect that goes by several other names, such as "sickle scotoma", "arcuate scotoma" or "scimitar scotoma". Other eponyms named after Bjerrum include:
After Bjerrum's retirement in 1910, his work in campimetry was continued by his assistant, Henning Rønne (1878-1947).
Jannik Petersen Bjerrum was the father of the chemist Niels Bjerrum and the brother of physicist Kirstine Meyer.

Ambrosia psilostachya

Ambrosia psilostachya is a species of ragweed known by the common names Cuman ragweed, perennial ragweed, and western ragweed. 
It is native to most of North America including all of southern Canada, nearly all of the continental United States, and the northern half of Mexico. It is a common plant in many habitat types, including disturbed areas such as roadsides. 
It can be found in parts of Eurasia as an introduced species. 
Description.
"Ambrosia psilostachya" is an erect perennial herb growing a slender, branching, straw-colored stem to a maximum height near two meters, but more often remaining under one meter tall. Leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and vary in shape from lance-shaped to nearly oval, and they are divided into many narrow, pointed lobes. The stem and leaves are hairy. 
The top of the stem is occupied by an inflorescence which is usually a spike. The species is monoecious, and the inflorescence is composed of staminate (male) flower heads with the pistillate heads located below and in the axils of leaves. 
The pistillate heads yield fruits which are achenes located within oval-shaped greenish-brown burs about half a centimeter long. The burs are hairy and sometimes spiny. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting up from a creeping rhizome-like root system. 
This plant had a number of medicinal uses among several different Native American tribes, including the Cheyenne, Kumeyaay (Diegueno), and Kiowa people.

Marion Rice

Marion Burbank Stevens Rice (September 9, 1904 – April 12, 1995) was an American modern dance choreographer, dance teacher and producer.
Early life.
Rice was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, settled in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and founded the "Marion Rice Studio of the Dance" where she taught and performed Denishawn technique for over 60 years. She studied in the late 1920s and early 30's with Ted Shawn, Ruth St. Denis, Miriam Winslow and the Braggiotti sisters at the Braggiotti-Denishawn School of Dance in Boston, often performing Denishawn works in their concerts.
Other work.
She produced work by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn as well as her own choreography. Among the dancers and choreographers she trained were her daughter Carolyn Brown of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, her daughter-in-law Mona Irvine Rice, and her granddaughters Robin Rice and Rebecca Rice.
Dance company.
She also operated her own dance company, the Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers, and in 1980 staged her version of "Soaring," for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. Marion Rice Denishawn performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1972, the Marymount Manhattan Theater (New York) in 1976 and City College (New York) in 1986 at the "Roots: Foundations of American Modern Dance Festival".
Current events.
In 2000, Marion Rice Denishawn performed in the "Dance in Millennium" Festival in Washington, DC. The company presented "Boston Braggiotti and Denishawn", a lecture demonstration illuminating a select number of the early Denishawn works.
Anna Kisselgoff wrote in the "New York Times": 
"Marion Rice's stagings of Denishawn works are always fresh and beautiful – the perfect example was the St. Denis "Valse No. 14" in which Robin Rice and Rebecca Rice were also swathed in swirling fabric – but much more actively so than in theFuller solo. The amount of basic ballet taught in the Denishawn schools was evident in Robin Rice's luminous performance of Shawn's "Red Radiance."

Congregation Beth Israel (Scottsdale, Arizona)

Congregation Beth Israel () is a Jewish congregation located at 10460 North 56th Street in Scottsdale, Arizona. Formally incorporated in 1920, it affiliated with the Reform movement in 1935.
Abraham Lincoln Krohn was rabbi of Beth Israel from 1938 to 1953, and during his tenure the congregation grew from under 100 to almost 600 member families. He was succeeded by Albert Plotkin, who served for almost 40 years.
Beth Israel's original building in Downtown Phoenix, constructed in 1921–1922, is listed on both the city’s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places. After being sold in 1949, it housed churches until 2002, when the Jewish community repurchased it. In 2007 the Arizona Jewish Historical Society started a $4 million campaign to restore it and convert it into a museum.
, Beth Israel was the oldest synagogue in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The senior rabbi was Stephen Kahn, the associate rabbi was Rony Keller, and the cantor was Jaime Shpall.
Early years, first building.
Jewish settlers in Phoenix began gathering for High Holiday services as early as 1906. A formal congregation was established by Barnett E. Marks, a lawyer from Chicago, who held services in a room over Melczer's saloon, and also organized a Sunday School to provide a Jewish education for his two sons. By 1918 the congregation was calling itself "Emanuel", and holding services in English and Hebrew on the Jewish Festivals. In 1920, the congregation incorporated as "Congregation Beth Israel". Its first rabbi was David L. Liknaitz, and its first president was Charles Steinberg. Liknaitz would serve until 1924.
Services were held in a number of temporary locations. In 1915 and 1917 respectively the local chapters of the B'nai B'rith and the National Council of Jewish Women were formed. Together they purchased a church in 1921, and converted it for use as a Phoenix's first synagogue by the Phoenix Hebrew Center Association. The Association soon became defunct, and the building was taken over by the Congregation Beth Israel.
That year the congregation raised $14,000 (today $) and hired the architectural firm Lescher, Kibbey and Mahoney to design and construct a synagogue building near Central Avenue and Culver Street, in Downtown Phoenix. The building, a simple, stuccoed, gable-end-to-the-street Mission Revival Style structure, was constructed in 1921–1922, and an annex added in 1930.
At the time the building was constructed, the Phoenix area had only 120 Jewish residents. The synagogue served as a cultural center for the Jewish community, including hosting communal Passover Seders, at a time when Jews faced discrimination at hotels and other places of public gathering.
During the 1920s the synagogue had difficulty keeping rabbis. Most would only stay for a few years, and one in particular was suspected of being a charlatan; "he rabbi college where he claimed he attended had no record of him." A.I. Goldberg served from 1924 to 1925, Adolph Rosenberg from 1926 to 1929.
In 1930, the congregation became divided over the need for the Jewish community to hire a "shochet" to ritually slaughter animals for kosher meat, and over whether the synagogue should hire a Reform or Conservative rabbi. More traditional members broke away to form the Beth El Congregation, affiliated with Conservative Judaism.
That year Samuel Dodkin Hurwitz was hired as Beth Israel's rabbi. Born in Krychaw, Belarus in 1901, his family emigrated to the United States in 1903. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1926, and was ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1929. His first pulpit, from 1929 to 1930, was Temple Emanuel in Davenport, Iowa. In 1934 he was appointed to the board of the Phoenix Public Library. In 1935 he left Beth Israel to become rabbi at Temple Beth El in Benton Harbor, Michigan.
Philip W. Jaffa, ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1928, joined as rabbi in 1935. He adopted the Reform movement's "Union Prayer Book" and its religious school curriculum, and added choir music to the services. That year much of the synagogue building was destroyed by a fire, and Jaffa's whole library was lost. The congregation re-built the structure, extensively remodeling the sanctuary, and added a religious school building/classroom annex. Jaffa would serve until 1938.
Krohn era.
Abraham Lincoln Krohn became Beth Israel's rabbi in 1938, replacing Jaffa, who was not well. At the time, the congregation had 100 or fewer member families, and 64 children in the religious school. Born in 1893 and named after Abraham Lincoln, Krohn was one of eight children of Russian Jews who had immigrated to the United States. His first career was as a social worker, but during a chance meeting, Stephen Samuel Wise was "so impressed with Krohn's compassion, intellect and eloquence he strongly urged him to consider a career in the rabbinate." Krohn entered Wise's Jewish Institute of Religion in 1926, and graduated as a rabbi in 1930. He then served as assistant rabbi of Temple Sholom in Plainfield, New Jersey for a year, then as senior rabbi at Temple Albert in Albuquerque, New Mexico for almost seven years, before joining Beth Israel.
Krohn was heavily involved in the community. According to Ira Morton of the Arizona Jewish Historical Society:
The organizations he served in the capacity of president or board member include B'nai Brith, the Urban League, the Maricopa Mental Health Association and Child Guidance Clinic, Phoenix Public Library, Phoenix Elementary School District, the American Red Cross, the Roosevelt Council of Boy Scouts, the United Fund (later changed to United Way) and the Jewish Family Service (now Jewish Family & Children's Service), which Krohn founded. Krohn also served as president of the Valley of the Sun Symphony Orchestra, which later became the Phoenix Symphony, moderator of a Phoenix town hall lecture series, lecturer in biblical literature at Arizona State University and as a civilian chaplain for neighboring military bases and hospitals during World War II.
During Krohn's tenure the congregation began calling itself "Temple Beth Israel", and under his leadership the synagogue flourished.
During World War II, Beth Israel provided religious services for servicemen stationed at Luke Air Force Base, and hosted dances for the military personnel there. In 1942, the congregation started its Judaica library, which initially consisted of 60 works on one shelf.
By the late 1940s, the congregation had increased in size to approximately 300 families, and had outgrown its original facilities. The congregation moved to a more suburban location at Eleventh and Flower in 1949, and formalized its relationship with the Reform movement by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism). The Central Avenue and Culver Street building was sold to the Southern Baptist Convention, and housed the First Chinese Baptist Church until 1981, and then the Iglesia Bautista Central. By 2001 it was on the market again, and the Jewish community raised $540,000 (today $) to purchase it in 2002. The building is listed on both the city’s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places.
When Krohn stepped down as rabbi in 1953 due to poor health, the congregation had grown to 538 families. Krohn had also been active in interfaith work, and in June, 1958 was named Man of the Year by the National Conference of Christians and Jews at its annual dinner. He was, however, too ill to attend, and died five months later.
Plotkin and Segel eras.
By 1955, Phoenix's Jewish population had grown to over 3,000 families, and the city still had two Jewish congregations, Beth Israel and Beth El. That year, with the support of Krohn, Albert Plotkin joined Beth Israel as rabbi. Born in 1920 and raised in South Bend, Indiana, his parents were immigrants from Russia. After getting an undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame, he entered Hebrew Union College in 1943 – on academic probation, because he had taken no Hebrew at Notre Dame. He was ordained by Hebrew Union College in 1948, graduating with a Master of Hebrew Letters. Plotkin had started his rabbinic career as assistant rabbi of Temple De Hirsch in Seattle, his first pulpit after ordination. There he met his future wife Sylvia Pincus, whose family were long-time members of Temple De Hirsch. They married a year later, and shortly after moved to Spokane, Washington, where Plotkin became senior rabbi at Temple Emanuel.
During his tenure at Beth Israel, Plotkin was heavily involved in Phoenix's Jewish and non-Jewish communities. He was a strong Zionist at Hebrew Union College, at a time when the movement was unpopular there, and was later a staunch supporter of Israel. He was an advocate for civil rights, and a supporter of the arts. He founded the Jewish Studies program at Arizona State University and taught there, and volunteered for 25 years as a chaplain at Phoenix Veterans Hospital. In 1972, the National Conference of Christians and Jews awarded him the National Award for Brotherhood.
Beth Israel added a "cultural and educational wing" to its Flower Street building in 1967, and in it Sylvia Plotkin founded a Jewish museum. The museum had three galleries: one "houseartifacts from a Tunisian synagogue, a second [held a Judaica collection that chroniclethe history of Arizona Jewry and a third [was used for exhibitions." Sylvia Plotkin would direct the museum until her death in 1996, acquiring and mounting many exhibitions there. Renamed the "Sylvia Plotkin Judaica Museum" the day before her death, it was "one of the largest and most respected synagogue museums in the United States." After Plotkin's death, Pamela Levin became the museum's director; she had begun working with Plotkin as a volunteer in 1985, and eventually earned a degree in museum studies.
Albert Plotkin would himself go on to serve as the congregation's rabbi for almost 40 years, retiring in 1992, and becoming rabbi emeritus. He loved opera music, and two years after retiring, he sang professionally with the Arizona Opera. The Plotkins' daughter Debra would become the founding artistic director of the Toronto Jewish Film Festival, and their daughter Janis was, for 21 years, one of the main forces behind the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, and its executive director from 1994 to 2002.
Plotkin was succeeded by Kenneth Segel in 1992, and the following year Howard Tabaknek joined as cantor. In 1997, the congregation moved to its current location at 10460 North 56th Street and Shea Boulevard. The building had a main sanctuary that seated 500, and a chapel that seated 300. The Torah ark was decorated with "fused glass surrounded by colored glass".
Tabaknek left to join Temple Shalom in Succasunna, New Jersey in 2000, and was replaced by Andrew Meyer as cantor and Michael Sokol as "cantorial soloist". Meyer had previously served for five years as spiritual leader of Temple Beth Emeth in Scottsdale, Arizona. Sokol, who grew up in Phoenix and had his Bar Mitzvah at Beth Israel, was a professor of voice and opera at University of California, Santa Barbara, and sang with New York's Metropolitan Opera for three years.
Segel would serve as rabbi for until 2002, moving to Temple Beth Or in Montgomery, Alabama.
Recent events.
Stephen Kahn became Beth Israel's rabbi in July 2003. By then, membership was approximately 1,000 families, the largest Jewish congregation in Arizona. The congregational library, which was open to the public, had grown to over 20,000 volumes, making it one of the largest Judaica libraries in the Southwestern United States.
For financial reasons, Levin's job as museum director was reduced from 25 to 12 hours per week in 2004, and the position made volunteer in 2005. By then, the museum had 8,000 visitors a year, regular traveling exhibits, and the number of artifacts in it had grown to over 1,000.
In 2005, the congregation purchased a lot across the street from its building, and the house on it, to accommodate future growth. At that time the synagogue had over 900 member families.
That year the congregation also reverted to its original name of "Congregation Beth Israel". In Kahn's view, "To me, a 'congregation' represents people and community while the word "temple" represents a place or building. I would like us to be about the people."
The Arizona Jewish Historical Society undertook a $4 million campaign in 2007 to raise the funds needed to restore the original synagogue building and other related structures to create the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center. The plan was for the Center to include a museum and other public spaces that would be used to show the connection between the history of the Jewish community as part of Arizona's history. A $150,000 grant had been received in May of that year from the Arizona State Heritage Fund. By August 2008 much of the work of the first phase – the restoration of the sanctuary and annex – had been completed, and $2.1 million of the $2.6 million required for the work had been raised.
In 2007, Beth Israel opened the Phoenix metropolitan area's first "mikvah" (ritual bath). It was, according to local Modern Orthodox rabbi Darren Kleinberg, "the first time in Jewish history that a mikvah has been built and approved under the auspices of Reform, Conservative and Orthodox rabbis."
The congregation also hired Jaime Shpall as cantor that year, replacing Bruce Benson, who left in 2006. Shpall, who graduated as a cantor from the Hebrew Union College in 1997, had previously served as cantor of Congregation Beth Israel in Austin, Texas. Plotkin died in February 2010.
, Beth Israel was the oldest congregation in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The senior rabbi was Stephen Kahn, the associate rabbi was Rony Keller, and the cantor was Jaime Shpall. The congregation also owned and operated Camp Daisy and Harry Stein, a Jewish overnight camp in Prescott National Forest near Prescott, Arizona, the only Jewish camp in the area.
Kahn briefly rose to national attention in 2014, when he penned a letter to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer comparing Arizona SB 1062 to the anti-Semitic laws of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

Ira R. Schnapp (October 10, 1892 – July 1969) was a logo designer and letterer who defined the DC Comics house style for thirty years. He designed the world-famous "Action Comics" logo, as well as scores of others for the company.
Life and career.
Early life and immigration.
Schnapp was born in Sassow, Austria, in a region called Galicia. A Jew, he came to America with his family some time before 1910, when he was 18 years old. Although his exact schooling is unknown, Schnapp was apparently well-educated. According to DC colorist Jack Adler, "Ira Schnapp was a very nice guy who had a classical background. He'd talk about things a lot of people wouldn't know about."
Stonecutter, engraver, intertitle designer, and lobby card designer.
Upon his arrival in the United States, Schnapp was already a skilled stonecutter, engraver, and graphic designer. In 1911, while still only 19 years old, Schnapp was hired to hand-carve the engraving on the front of the main branch of the New York Public Library: "MDCCCXCV • THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY • MDCCCCII". He then worked designing and engraving stamps for the United States Post Office Department, and in 1914 was hired as a stone carver for the post office. Schnapp personally designed the lettering, and hand-carved, the famous slogan "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" in the facade of the James Farley General Post Office. In the later years of the 1910s, Schnapp found work as a silent movie intertitle designer and movie theater lobby card designer.
DC.
Little is known about Schnapp in the 1920s, but by 1934 he was working as a title designer for Trojan Publishing Corporation, a pulp magazine publisher. Shortly thereafter, in 1938, Schnapp was hired by comic book publisher DC Comics for his first job. It was an association that lasted for thirty years. Schnapp worked for DC from 1938 to 1968, creating scores of logos and lettering countless covers and interiors, yet ironically he only received a single in-print credit (in "Inferior Five" #6, published in 1966). Most of Schnapp's work was done on front covers, and "mere" cover letterers (or interior letterers, for that matter) were never credited in the era in which Schnapp worked.
In mid-1938, Schnapp created the iconic "Action Comics" logo for DC. He also refined and perfected the "Superman" logo in 1940. Over time, Schnapp designed scores of logos for the company's comic books, virtually defining DC's look for 30 years. In addition to the "Action" and "Superman" logos, some of the more celebrated logos Schnapp designed include:
DC house ads.
With Superman editor Mort Weisinger, Schnapp designed and hand-lettered the DC house ads "Coming... Super-Attractions!" which proliferated throughout the pages of the company's comics.
Lettering.
Among many other books, Schnapp was the original interior letterer on "Superman" and "Green Lantern". Despite his brilliance as a logo and title designer, however, in the words of comics historian Kirk Kimball, "Schnapp's word-balloon lettering was . . . surprisingly pedestrian." Most of Schnapp's interior lettering was done for DC's line of romance comics. In fact, pop artist Roy Lichtenstein used the splash page of a romance story lettered by Schnapp in "Secret Hearts" #83 (November 1962) as the basis for one of Lichtenstein's most iconic works. Lichtenstein slightly reworked the art and dialogue, and re-lettered Schnapp's original word balloon. "Drowning Girl" (1963) is now part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
Comics Code Authority seal.
In 1955, with changes brought about by Dr. Fredric Wertham and the adoption of the Comics Code, Schnapp designed the Comics Code Authority seal, which became a fixture on comic book covers for over forty years.
Retirement.
Carmine Infantino's appointment as DC's editorial director in 1966 brought about a major shake-up in the company. One of the first things Infantino did was bring in Gaspar Saladino as the new cover letterer for the company's entire line of comics. Long-time DC writer Marv Wolfman recalled that "DC kept Ira employed doing miscellaneous things around the production department because . . . management felt they owed him for all his great work." Saladino called Schnapp "'Mr. DC.'" . . . It was sad that when he left it was as though he'd never been there at all. So much of it all came down to business, though. It was to make money."
Schnapp left DC in 1968 and retired to Florida.
Personal life.
According to census documents, Schnapp married a woman named Beatrice in 1919, and the couple took up residence in the Bronx, New York. They had two children, Martin and Theresa. Schnapp died in New York in 1969.

Hardwick, California

Hardwick is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kings County, California, United States. It is part of the Hanford–Corcoran Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 138 at the 2010 Census. The village is located northwest of Hanford, at an elevation of .
Hardwick is in the San Joaquin Valley on Excelsior Avenue between 14th and 15th Avenues. The Kings River runs north of the community. Its ZIP Code is 93230 and the community is inside area code 559.
The Kings County Fire Department operates a fire station in Hardwick.
The community is located in the Kings River-Hardwick School District.
History.
Hardwick was named to commemorate an official of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
A post office was established in Hardwick in 1895, discontinued in 1904, reestablished in 1909, and finally permanently closed in 1942. Subsequently, the community has been served by the post office located in Hanford.
The first school in the community was moved from the then-fading town of Kingston. Another schoolhouse was reportedly built in 1893. Subsequently, a new school was constructed in 1914 and operated until the Hardwick and Kings River schools unified in 1962. The present fire station is located on the site of that school.
Demographics.
The 2010 United States Census reported that Hardwick had a population of 138. The population density was 994.6 people per square mile (384.0/km²).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 86 persons (62.3%).
The Census reported that 137 people (99.3% of the population) lived in households, 1 (0.7%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.
There were 34 households, out of which 20 (58.8%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 21 (61.8%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 2 (5.9%) had a female householder with no husband present, 4 (11.8%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 4 (11.8%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 1 (2.9%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 6 households (17.6%) were made up of individuals and 3 (8.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.03. There were 27 families (79.4% of all households); the average family size was 4.56.
The population was spread out with 52 people (37.7%) under the age of 18, 16 people (11.6%) aged 18 to 24, 29 people (21.0%) aged 25 to 44, 27 people (19.6%) aged 45 to 64, and 14 people (10.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 25.5 years. For every 100 females there were 112.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 115.0 males.
There were 37 housing units at an average density of 266.7 per square mile (103.0/km²), of which 18 (52.9%) were owner-occupied, and 16 (47.1%) were occupied by renters.

<doc id="18519684" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18519684" title="San Jacinto Fault Zone">
San Jacinto Fault Zone

The San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ) is a major strike-slip fault zone that runs through San Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial Counties in Southern California. The SJFZ is a component of the larger San Andreas transform system and is considered to be the most seismically active fault zone in the area. Together they relieve the majority of the stress between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates.
The SJFZ itself consists of many individual fault segments, some of which have only been individualized as recently as the 1980s, but activity along the line of faults has been documented since the 1890s. One segment of the SJFZ, the Anza seismic gap, has not experienced any major activity since instrumental records have been kept. Each segment was evaluated for its seismic risk and was assigned a probability for the occurrence of a large rupture for the thirty year period starting in 1995.
While several of the large earthquakes along the SJFZ have not resulted in significant property damage or loss of life (due to their remote location) the cities of Hemet and San Jacinto were both heavily damaged in two significant events in 1899 and 1918. The recurrence interval for a series of large earthquakes starting in 1899 (including the 5.9 1937 Terwilliger Valley earthquake) was 18, 5, 14, 5, 12, 14, and 19 years, yet there has not been a strong earthquake for years (since the 1987 Superstition Hills and Elmore Ranch sequence).
Characteristics.
The San Jacinto Fault Zone and the San Andreas Fault (SAF) accommodate up to 80% of the slip rate between the North American and Pacific plates. The extreme southern portion of the SAF has experienced two moderate events in historical times, while the SJFZ is one of California's most active fault zones and has repeatedly produced both moderate and large events. The locations of earthquakes before the 1954 Arroyo Salada earthquake are not precisely known, but the events' effects place them on the SJFZ and not on the SAF. The 1923 North San Jacinto Fault earthquake struck the Inland Empire area of southern California at a time of relatively low population, and a repeat event in modern times would result in heavy property damage and loss of life.
Segments.
A 1995 report by the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities identified seven individual segments of the SJFZ. The group consisted of more than three dozen seismologists, including Keiiti Aki and C. Allin Cornell, and was organized by the Southern California Earthquake Center for the USGS and the California Office of Emergency Services. The 1995 paper was the third in a series of reports that was set in motion following the 1992 Landers earthquake in southern California with the intention of updating the data and the approach for calculating the probabilities for large earthquakes along the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto Fault zones. Both these fault zones were grouped together as having adequate paleoseismic data to assign conditional probabilities for future damaging earthquakes.
The original Working Group in 1988 had identified five segments of the fault zone. From north to south, the segments were labeled the San Bernardino Valley, San Jacinto Valley, Anza, Borrego Mountain, and Superstition Hills. The 1995 group then added the Coyote Creek and Superstition Mountain segments, defined the Anza segment to include the Clark and Casa Loma faults, and updated the slip rates for each segment. The three northern sections (San Bernardino, San Jacinto, and Anza) were assigned 12 mm per year of slip and the four remaining sections were given 4 mm of slip, and error rates were half the total estimated slip for each segment (±6 mm and ±2 mm respectively) with the exception of the Anza segment which had slightly exaggerated rates of +7 mm and -5 mm.
Thirty year probabilities for segment-rupturing earthquakes were estimated using three separate models then a preferred weighted result was presented for each segment. While the San Bernardino (37%) and San Jacinto (43%) segments both saw large increases since the 1988 report, due in part to increased estimates for slip rates and decreased estimates for inherent displacement, the Anza segment (17%) was determined to have a decreased probability, based on an increased segment length. The Coyote Creek (18%), Superstition Mountain (9%), and Superstition Hills (2%) segments received first time estimates (none were assigned in 1988) and the Borrego Mountain segment received a more specific value of 6%.
San Bernardino Valley.
The northernmost segment of the SJFZ includes the Claremont fault (though other parallel strands exist) and spans a total of .
San Jacinto Valley.
Moving southward, this segment includes the parallel Casa Loma and Claremont faults with the southern limit at the point where both of these faults unite to form the Clark fault. The April 1918 event most likely occurred on this segment.
Anza.
While the 1988 Working Group included the Clark, Coyote Creek, and Buck Ridge faults, the 1995 Working Group limited the segment to just the Clark fault. A paleoseismic investigation on this segment at Hog Lake indicated three historical surface-rupturing events occurred around 1210, 1530, and 1750 with an average recurrence period for a magnitude 7.0–7.5 earthquake of 250 years.
Coyote Creek.
With a recurrence period of 175 (+158 / -95) years, no surface-rupturing event has occurred on this segment since 1892.
Borrego Mountain.
The extent of this segment is based on the surface rupture of the 1968 Borrego Mountain earthquake and shares a recurrence interval of 175 years.
Superstition Hills.
The 1988 Working Group defined the segment as two parallel strands, the Superstition Hills and Superstition Mountain faults, though no slip rate or recurrence interval was known. On November 23, 1987 the Working Group determined that the available information was still not adequate to assign 30-year probabilities. On November 24, 1987 the fault ruptured, along with an unknown fault (later named the Elmore Ranch fault). Kenneth W. Hudnut and Kerry Sieh examined the surface rupture (along with a trench investigation) in 1989 and estimated the slip rate for the prior 330 years to be 2 – 6 mm/yr (±1 mm). The Working Group used these new figures to assign a slip rate of 4 ±2 mm/yr with an average recurrence interval of 250 (+400 / -133) years for the segment.
Superstition Mountains.
Three surface-faulting events were found to have occurred along this newly added segment. A trench investigation by Larry Gurrola and Thomas Rockwell near the north shore of ancient Lake Cahuilla dated the events to 885–1440. The slip rate for the Borrego mountain segment (4 ± 2mm/yr) was extrapolated for use along the segment and a recurrence interval of 340 years was established.
Anza seismic gap.
With at least six and as many as ten large events since 1890, the right-lateral strike-slip SJFZ is southern California's most restless fault, with the exception of several sections which have seen less frequent activity. In a 1975 study, one of these (a stretch) was labeled the "Anza to Coyote Mountain slip gap", and was further refined in a 1984 paper by seismologists Christopher Sanders and Hiroo Kanamori to include only a smaller section near the town of Anza. By studying several moderate events (and their aftershocks) that occurred in 1967 (4.7L), 1975 (4.8L), and 1980 (5.5L), Sanders and Kanamori determined the seismogenic but locked nature of the gap. Were the entire fault segment to rupture in a single event, this newly modified length limited the potential of the segment to generate a magnitude 6.5 earthquake, similar in size to previous events along the SJFZ. However, if the slip were to extend out of the Anza area, the earthquake could be up to, but not larger than 7.0 in magnitude.
Link to San Andreas Fault.
At least six large ruptures of the San Jacinto Fault Zone are known to have followed the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake that ruptured the central segment of the San Andreas Fault. These events began with the 1899 San Jacinto earthquake and occurred at intermittent intervals culminating with the 1987 Superstition Hills and Elmore Ranch events. The 1857 rupture spanned a total of and terminated on the southeast end near the point where the San Jacinto Fault Zone branches away from the San Andreas Fault Zone at the Cajon Pass. In a paper published in the journal "Science", Christopher Sanders plotted the earthquakes of the SJFZ by time and location and found that a uniform pattern became apparent. Moving southeastward from the Cajon Pass, the large SJFZ events appear on a line with a slope of 1.7 km per year and Sanders hypothesized that the 1857 earthquake introduced a strain pulse that migrated southeast and triggered large earthquakes as it traversed the SJFZ at that rate.
Sanders, in a 1993 newspaper interview following the publication of the paper, said that "these earthquakes were given that little extra bump over the edge by this strain pulse". Other seismologists had mixed reviews of Sanders' theory. Kerry Sieh (from Caltech) acknowledged that "his hypothesis is not unreasonable." Hiroo Kanamori added that "It's certainly possible that the current seismicity in southern California is still reflecting the effect of 1857."
Earthquakes.
An early morning event measuring 6.3 occurred in northeast San Diego County that was reported with a maximum intensity of MM VI at all Southern Pacific stations between Pomona to Yuma, Arizona. The railroad line runs near both the San Andreas and San Jacinto fault traces northeast of Riverside, and through San Gorgonio Pass (near the Banning Fault). Since the event was felt equally at the railroad stations, Sanders and Kanamori submitted that the earthquake was most likely not a result of slip of any fault strand near the railroad, and that a more probable source of the event would be farther south along the SJFZ near Anza, though this contradicted the report from the 1995 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, which placed the earthquake on the northernmost San Bernardino segment of the SJFZ. ()
Another earthquake with an approximate magnitude of 6.5 occurred in the same region and delivered similar effects as the 1890 shock. Felt reports came from San Diego, Los Angeles, and Yuma, Arizona. Two shocks were reportedly felt at San Bernardino and Ontario at 3:15 and again at 3:20 am with the direction of the vibrations moving from east to west. The first shock was described as being very heavy and that it had broken dishes and stopped clocks. It is possible that it was an aftershock of the February 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake. ()
On December 25, with a maximum intensity of MM IX, this magnitude 6.6 earthquake destroyed San Jacinto and Hemet and six were killed by adobe walls that collapsed at Saboba (just east of San Jacinto). A fissure, which may have been surface rupture of the San Jacinto Fault, ran under a house that was severely damaged near Hemet. The effects of the early morning earthquake were severe. Not all the buildings in San Jacinto were completely destroyed by the thirty seconds of shaking, but most of the brick buildings' second floors were heavily damaged. ()
On April 21, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake caused major damage in the same area as the 1899 San Jacinto earthquake, with several injuries and one death occurring there. Many of the buildings in San Jacinto's business district were of poor construction and all but one frame building and one concrete building collapsed though high quality structures did not experience serious damage. Minor damage to other buildings within of San Jacinto also occurred. Roadways and irrigation canals also sustained damage and small sand blows were seen on a farm near San Jacinto. ()
The earthquake occurred on a Sunday afternoon when most of the businesses in San Jacinto were closed and void of customers. According to a 1918 report by Sidney Townley, it was there in the business district that damage was the greatest, though Hemet was also severely damaged. The area was surveyed for three days about a week following the event, and Townley acknowledged that damage to chimneys, windows, and plaster walls occurred to buildings and structures within one hundred miles of San Jacinto, but not all locations with damage were surveyed. Some of the damage that was inspected included landslides, partially collapsed buildings, and damaged irrigation canals and roads. Ground cracks were observed near the banks of the San Jacinto river and sand blows were seen on a farm northwest of San Jacinto.
On July 23, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake damaged numerous buildings in the area surrounding San Bernardino and Redlands. The San Bernardino County Courthouse and Hall of Records was damaged beyond repair and was ultimately rebuilt. The large brick building housing the Patton State Hospital (also in San Bernardino) was closed then demolished because of the severe damage. No one was killed in the quake but two were critically injured. ()
On March 25, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake occurred in San Diego County. Damage was limited as a result of the epicenter being located away from population centers, but some damage to chimneys and windows was found in Anza, Hemet, and Palm Springs. The maximum felt intensity was MM VI. ()
On October 21, a magnitude 6.0 event occurred near Borrego Valley. Landslides damaged a railroad bridge north of Jacumba. Minor damage was also reported in several towns in the area and several aftershocks were felt. ()
On March 19, an early morning magnitude 6.2 earthquake rattled much of southern California. Damage included broken water pipes, cracked walls and swimming pools, and broken windows. The earthquake was felt over a wide area including western Arizona and southwestern Nevada. Several aftershocks followed with the strongest occurring later the same day. The event occurred at 2 am local time and was described as two separate motions that took place within 10–15 seconds. Though the quake was reportedly felt in adjacent states the Kern County Sheriff stated that the rolling movements were not felt there. Kern County was the scene of the 1952 Kern County earthquake. ()
On April 9, a magnitude 6.4 ML earthquake with a maximum perceived intensity of MM VII hit the extreme eastern San Diego County area and created a surface break along the Coyote Creek Fault. California State Route 78 was damaged with cracks near Ocotillo Wells and large boulders blocked the Montezuma-Borrego Springs Highway. Other rockslides occurred at Palm Canyon and Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. One house was split apart in Ocotillo Wells with one bedroom becoming detached from the rest of the home. The mainshock was felt in Arizona and Nevada and the largest aftershock damaged a theater's walls in Calexico near the United States - Mexico border.
According to a report in the "Los Angeles Times", this was the strongest earthquake to affect southern California since the Tehachapi earthquake fifteen years earlier. Taller buildings swayed in both Los Angeles and San Diego and power outages affected numerous areas, primarily in the cities of Imperial Valley. Power failures along with disruption to telephone service caused problems in the Hemet Valley area, and smaller power outages in Los Angeles and Orange Counties also occurred. A brick wall collapsed at a laundromat in Westmorland (in the El Centro Metropolitan Area) but no one was injured, and in the seaside neighborhoods of San Diego county several hundred windows were broken. Charles Richter, a Caltech seismologist, stated that the earthquake was centered near Ocotillo Wells about southeast of Los Angeles. The mainshock occurred at 6:28 pm and aftershocks continued through the evening, but were tapering off by 10 pm. ()
Two earthquakes in late November caused property damage totaling three million in Imperial County. The two events were separated by eleven hours and were located in the western Imperial Valley on the Superstition Hills Fault and a previously unknown fault. Damage in Westmoreland, Imperial, and El Centro consisted of collapsed chimneys, broken windows, and damaged highways. The Worthington Road bridge, at the New River, failed due to liquefaction and at the Desert Test Range Control Center, water tanks toppled into the building and other equipment crashed through a window. Activities were suspended there for several days due to the damage. The Southern California Irrigation District estimated damage to be $600,000 – $750,000. The initial shock produced a small amount of deformation in the canal's liner while the second main shock caused considerable damage to thousands of feet of canal lining in the northwest section of the valley.
Several foreshocks preceded the main shocks and a series of aftershocks included two in the range of magnitude five. On the Mexican side of the border, 50 injuries and two deaths were reported, and 44 were treated for their injuries in California. According to the spokesperson for the state of Baja California, a motor vehicle accident east of Mexicali that claimed the lives of a mother and her four year old son was blamed on the earthquake. Thomas H. Heaton, a USGS seismologist, stated that the faults in the area are difficult to track down because of the sediment deposited in the valley, which had been an intermittent drainage basin of the Colorado River.
The Superstition Hills fault (SHF) lies between the Coyote Creek fault that ruptured during the 1968 event and the Imperial Fault that ruptured during the 1940 El Centro earthquake and the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake. To the northeast are several cross faults that trend northeast. One of these faults ruptured during a large aftershock of the 1979 event and another slipped as the smaller of the two shocks during the November 1987 sequence. The first shock (on what became known as the Elmore Ranch fault) measured 6.2 Ms and the shock 11.4 hours later on the SHF measured 6.6 Ms. ( & )

South Cuyama Oil Field

The South Cuyama Oil Field is a large oil and gas field in the Cuyama Valley and the adjacent northern foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains in northeastern Santa Barbara County, California. Discovered in 1949, and with a cumulative production of around of oil, it ranks 27th in size in the state, but is believed to retain only approximately two percent of its original oil (approximately ), according to the official estimates of the California Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). Of the top forty onshore oil fields in California, it is the most recent to be discovered, but by the end of 2008 only 87 wells remained in production.
Setting.
The oil field is south of the town of New Cuyama in the portion of the Cuyama Valley that slopes gently into the northern foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains. Parts of the field are on hilly terrain, and some is within the Los Padres National Forest. The field can be reached from California State Route 166 via Aliso Canyon Road on the northwest, and Perkins Road on the northeast; Perkins Road joins 166 at the town of New Cuyama. While these roads run roughly north-south, Foothill Road crosses through the field from east to west, eventually reaching Santa Barbara Canyon Road on the east and State Route 33. Elevations on the field range from approximately 2,200 to 3,000 feet (670 to 910 meters). The productive area of the field is approximately long by two across, with the long axis running northwest to southeast; the total productive area as reported by DOGGR is .
The climate is semi-arid, with occasional marine influence, as the Cuyama Valley is open to the sea, although through a narrow gap. Summers are hot with temperatures commonly exceeding ; winters are cool, with the mean freeze-free period being about 250 days. Average annual rainfall is about 12 inches, almost all of it falling in the winter in the form of rain, although occasional snowfall has occurred. All streams are dry in the summer, and even the Cuyama River dries up by the late summer in most years. The area is prone to brushfires in the summer and fall; indeed a fire in 1994 caused a loss of $76,000 to the operators, and in July 2006 an accident on the oil field involving a metal plate crossing power lines started the Perkins Fire, which burned on the north side of the Sierra Madre Mountains.
Native vegetation in the vicinity of the field ranges from grassland to chaparral to oak woodland. Drainage is to the north, towards the Cuyama River, along Bitter Creek, Branch Canyon Wash, and several ephemeral drainages.
Geology.
Oil in the South Cuyama Basin comes from two primary pools, the Miocene-age Dibblee Sand and the Colgrove Sand, porous units in the Vaqueros Formation underneath the largely impermeable Monterey Formation. The sedimentary Cuyama Basin is cut by many small faults, and the oil exists in a series of stratigraphic traps, where it is in most cases blocked in its upward motion by impermeable blocks of Monterey, often offset by faults. The average depth of oil in the field is about below ground surface, and the thickness of the oil-bearing units rarely exceeds ; in the separate southeastern area of the field, where the Colgrove sand is below ground surface, the oil bearing rock is only thick. The source rock for the South Cuyama oil is most likely the Soda Lake Shale member of the Vaqueros Formation.
Overlying the faulted and broken Miocene rocks, which include the Monterey, Branch Canyon, and Santa Margarita Formations, and separated by an unconformity, is about 2,000 to of the Pliocene Morales Formation. None of these upper rocks are oil-bearing, although gas has been produced from the Santa Margarita Formation.
Oil from the South Cuyama Field is of generally medium to high API gravity, ranging from 28 to 36 API, so it flows easily. A small pool in the Dibblee Sand in the now-abandoned Southeast Area of the field had oil of even higher gravity and lower viscosity; a well drilled there in 1975 was abandoned in 1978 after producing .
History, production and operations.
Richfield Oil Co., later part of Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), drilled the first well in the area to hit oil, on the advice of Thomas Dibblee, in May 1949. Richfield named the oil-bearing unit, the Dibblee Sand, in his honor. This single well initially produced , a large find for a region previously written off as being without petroleum potential. The discovery of oil here and in the nearby Russell Ranch Oil Field transformed the Cuyama Valley from an almost uninhabited region with a few cattle ranches into a mini-boom area; ARCO built the town of New Cuyama in the years after the oil discovery to house the oil workers and provide associated services.
ARCO was only the first of several companies to work the New Cuyama Field. In 1990, they sold off their interest in the field to Stream Energy. The next company to operate the field was Hallador Petroleum, which continued operations until 2005, at which time it sold its interest to E&B Natural Resources Management Corporation, the current operator, which also runs the Russell Ranch field four miles (6 km) to the northwest.
Peak production for the field was in 1951, shortly after discovery, during which over of oil were pumped from the Dibblee and Colgrove pools. Production has declined steadily since, with around pumped in 1977, 500,000 in 1987, 390,000 in 1997, and 270,000 in 2007. At the end of 2008, there were only 87 oil wells still in production.
Some enhanced recovery projects have been undertaken on the field. Since the oil in the South Cuyama Field is not heavy, steam injection has not been necessary to reduce viscosity and improve flow; however, both gas injection and waterflooding have been used, both in the Colgrove and Dibblee formations. The field operators used waterflooding between 1956 and 1973 in the Colgrove, with some success, and both gas injection and waterflooding have been used in the Dibblee Formation commencing in 1964 and 1955, respectively. As of 2008, E&B Resources still uses waterflooding to assist in flow of oil to pumping wells; other wells are designated for water disposal. At the end of 2008, the average water cut – the percentage of liquid pumped from oil wells that was water – was running at 98.4 percent, indicating a field very close to the end of its useful life. Wells on the field were producing an average of 7.9 barrels of oil per day, and the operators have been reinjecting the enormous quantities of water produced with the oil back into the formation through approximately 50 water disposal and water flood wells scattered throughout the field.
E&B also maintains a gas processing plant, known as Gas Plant 10, on the eastern side of the oil field; all natural gas production from the oil wells goes there. The purpose of the gas plant is to strip out hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from the gas, making it acceptable for commercial use. After processing at the plant it is sent on for sale, reinjected into the field to enhance recovery, or used as fuel for oilfield operations. NGLs are sent to a tank farm where they are mixed with the oil. Santa Barbara County gave the plant its first permit to operate in 1988.

Harras

Harras is an album of improvised music by Derek Bailey, John Zorn & William Parker. The album was released on the Japanese Avant label in 1996. Towards the end of the track "Evening Harras" there is 10 minutes of silence followed by a Bailey solo. "According to Derek Bailey, the abrupt cutoff was planned. Derek wanted to end it "on a high". The Bailey solo material appended after the silence was apparently Zorn's idea."
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Dean McFarlane awarded the album 3 stars stating "Evidently the candid session that took place on a night in New York resulted in a chaotic collision of ideas. With the performers being such strong voices individually, the abundant ideas fly in and out of the picture with no apparent regard to form; the session evolves from tepid beginnings into a no-holds-barred, rapid-fire assault on the senses. Fans of ultra-high-energy free improvisation will find it a delight to hear these three masters sparring on this one-off collaboration, making Harras a vital historical document which requires the gumption of a hardened avant-garde music fan to take the whole recording in one listen".

Pinnacle Race Course

Pinnacle Race Course was a thoroughbred horse racing track located in Huron Township, Michigan, southwest of Detroit off of Interstate 275. The track is just south of the Detroit Metro Airport.
History and information.
The track opened on July 18, 2008. The track was rushed into operation in the summer of 2008 to replace Muskegon's Great Lakes Downs on the Michigan racing schedule. Magna Entertainment Corporation closed Great Lakes Downs in November 2007 after years of financial losses.
Physical attributes.
The track has a one-mile dirt oval, with plans to build a 7/8-mile turf course by 2010.
The track opened with a 1,000-seat temporary grandstand, with a 4,000-seat permanent grandstand expected to be complete by 2010.
Racing.
The inaugural season of thoroughbred racing started July 18, 2008, ending November 2, 2008. The long-term plans call for racing annually from March through November, with the Michigan Derby for three-year-olds running in April, as a prep race for the Kentucky Derby.
In 2010 live racing was cut to Saturdays and Sundays only, 44 days in all, due to a budget reduction in the state's racing commission. The track also has reportedly not paid many of their bills in 2010 and had their utilities cut-off for a time and as of February 2011 their website was down.
On Nov. 3, 2010, Pinnacle Race Course surrendered its license back to the State of Michigan due to mounting financial problems. After doing so, the race track suspended all operations, giving no word on whether they would re-open or not. As of April 1, 2011, foreclosure proceedings are now in effect. Notices signifying such a situation are now prominently displayed on doors and windows of the building.

The Coffee Song

"The Coffee Song" (occasionally subtitled "They've Got an Awful Lot of Coffee in Brazil") is a novelty song written by Bob Hilliard and Dick Miles, first recorded by Frank Sinatra in 1946.
The song caricatures Brazil's coffee surplus, claiming (among other things) that no other beverages are available, and that a politician's daughter was fined for drinking water. Snowclones on this phrase have been used in analyses of the coffee industry, and of the Brazilian economy and culture.
Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1961 for his inaugural Reprise release, "Ring-a-Ding-Ding!"
Notable cover versions.
The song has been performed by (among others) Louis Prima, The Andrews Sisters, Sam Cooke, Rosemary Clooney,Eydie Gorme, Mike Doughty, Stan Ridgway, Soul Coughing, Osibisa and the Muppets; Bob Dorough, Cream recorded the song for inclusion on "Too Much Coffee Man", a CD of music based on the eponymous Shannon Wheeler character.

Science Realm

Science Realm is a United States Government project with the aim of creating a vertical-takeoff horizontal-landing (VTOHL) single stage to orbit (SSTO) craft, the term is also associated with the software this project uses to simulate takeoff and landing.
Science Dawn.
Science Realms predecessor Science Dawn was a classified program to build a rocket-launched supersonic horizontal-take off horizontal-landing (HOTOL) SSTO spaceplane. However, it became clear that horizontal takeoff requirement was an inappropriate application of rocket thrust-to-weight ratio; the angle and relative size of rocket and earth meant the path of least effort was almost completely vertical (completely against gravitation). Consequently, SCIENCE DAWN ended, and the focus transferred to SCIENCE REALM.
Spaceplane.
The Space Maneuver Vehicle (SMV) completed a successful autonomous approach and landing on its first flight test on 11 August 1998. The unmanned vehicle was dropped from an US Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter at an altitude of 9,000 feet, performed a controlled approach and landed on the runway. The total flight time was 90 seconds. During the initial portion of the its free fall, the maneuver vehicle was stabilized by a parachute. After it is released from the parachute, the vehicle accelerated and perform a controlled glide. This glide simulated the final approach and landing phases of such a vehicle returning from orbit.
Performance requirements.
The project is split into four Maximum Performance Missions Sets, which attempt to define the maximum conditions for four general uses of the spaceplane. Due to the high secrecy of the project, instead of giving a threshold and objective for each mission requirement, missions sets are defined.

U.S. Route 30 in Ohio

U.S. Route 30 (US 30) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs from Astoria, Oregon, to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the US state of Ohio, it is a major, , east–west highway that runs through the northern section of Ohio. Overall, the highway runs through rural areas of the state dominated by farm fields or woodlands; some segments are urban in character in the Mansfield and Canton areas.
The first transportation routes along US 30 in the state was the Lincoln Highway. In the early 1920s, two different state routes in the initial state route system. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US 30 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several cities and villages in the area. Future improvements to the route of US 30 includes a proposed easterly extension of the four-lane divided highway from Canton to SR 11, near Lisbon.
Route description.
US 30 runs for through northern Ohio. Between Indiana state line and Canton, US 30 is a divided highway. With sections of freeway between Van Wert and Delphos, Upper Sandusky and Mansfield, around Wooster and a final section in the area of Massillon and Canton. Like other state routes, it is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). All of US 30 in the state has been listed on the National Highway System.
Indiana to Upper Sandusky.
US 30 enters Ohio heading southeast, as a four-lane divided highway passing through rural farmland. The highway passes through southwestern Paulding County, before entering Van Wert County. The route has a short concurrency with State Route 49 (SR 49). US 30 has a trumpet interchange with US 224; this interchange is the western end of the US 224 concurrency. The road curves toward the east, passing near commercial properties, on the north side of Van Wert. The concurrency ends at a folded diamond interchange, with US 127. US 224 heads north concurrent with US 127. US 30 passes through farmland and curves southeasterly, becoming a limited access road. While heading southeasterly the road has an interchange with Lincoln Highway. The highway turns towards the east, crossing over the Little Auglaize River. After the river, the road has a diamond interchange with SR 66, providing access to Delphos.
US 30 curves southeasterly entering into Putnam County and crossing over SR 190, but there is no direct access between the two routes. After passing over SR 190, US 30 has an interchange with the Lincoln Highway, which also provides access to Delphos. The highway has an incomplete interchange with SR 309. After SR 309, US 30 becomes four-lane highway with cross-street traffic. The road crosses over the Auglaize River, followed by the Ottawa River. After the two rivers the highway has an interchange with SR 115, followed by an interchange with SR 65. US 30 crosses over Norfolk Southern railroad track and Interstate 75 (I–75), with no access to I–75 at this location. US 30 and I–75 parallel each other for a short distance, before I–75 curves towards the north. After I–75 curves north, US 30 has an interchange with SR 696; this interchange provides access to both I–75 and the village of Beaverdam. The road continues east and enters Hancock County, having an interchange with SR 235.

The road curves towards the northeast, having an interchange with the Lincoln Highway. US 30 has an interchange with US 23, this interchange is the western end of the concurrency with US 23. US 23 and US 30 head due east crossing over CSX railroad track and having an interchange with SR 199. The concurrency has an interchange with SR 53/SR 67, before the road curves towards the southeast. The highway crosses over the Sandusky River and has an interchange with the Lincoln Highway, before curving towards the south. The concurrency with US 23 ends at an interchange east of Upper Sandusky.
Upper Sandusky to Canton.
US 30 heads due east as a four-lane limited access freeway, passing through farmland. The road has an interchange with SR 231, before crossing into Crawford County. The highway crosses over Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad track, followed by an interchange with SR 4/SR 19/SR 100. The route crosses over a Norfolk Southern railroad track and has an interchange with SR 98.

The highway has an intersection with SR 603 and an intersection with SR 511. The route has an interchange with SR 60. The road has an intersection with SR 89. US 30 has an interchange with US 250, and the two routes continue concurrent towards the east. The highway enters Wooster and has an interchange with SR 3. After the interchange at SR 3, the route passes over Norfolk Southern railroad tracks, before having an interchange with SR 302. The road parallels a river, before having an interchange with the eastern end of the US 250 concurrency and the eastern end of the SR 3 concurrency. US 30 leaves Wooster and passes through farmland. The highway has a traffic signal at a T-intersection with SR 57. The route enters Dalton and has a T-intersection with the western terminus of US 30 Alternate.
US 30 by-passes most of Dalton to the south, having a traffic signal at SR 94. The highway has a T-intersection with the eastern terminus of US 30 Alternate. US 30 has an interchange with SR 172, and US 30 becomes a four-lane highway with limited access. The highway passes over SR 93, with no access between the two routes. US 30 has an interchange with SR 241, this interchange provides access to SR 93. East of the interchange at SR 241, US 30 crosses over the Tuscarawas River and has an interchange at US 62/SR 21, US 62 continues east concurrent with US 30. The route has an interchange with SR 627, the western terminus of SR 627, followed by an interchange with SR 297, the southern terminus of SR 297. After US 30/US 62 passes over SR 297, with interchange access, the route enters the city of Canton. US 30 has an interchange with I–77, this interchange is also the eastern end of the US 62 concurrency. East of I–77, US 30 has a short concurrency with SR 43. The four-lane divided highway with limited access ends at an interchange with Trump Avenue. US 30 heads north on Trump Avenue, as a four-lane highway with a center turn lane. US 30 has a traffic signal at SR 172, at this traffic signal US 30 turns east onto SR 172.
Canton to West Virginia.
US 30 and SR 172 head east as a two-lane highway, passing through mostly residential properties. US 30 enters East Canton, where US 30 turns south onto Cedar Street, while SR 172 continues east. The route turns onto Walnut Street and one block later has a traffic signal at SR 44; this is the west end of the concurrency with SR 44. The two routes head southeast passing through woodland and paralleling a Wheeling and Lake Erie railroad track. SR 44 turns south and US 30 continues southeasterly, passing through woodland and farmland, with houses. The road passes through Robertsville and curves towards the northeast, before curving back towards the southeast. The highway enters Minerva and passes through residential and commercial properties. In Minerva, the route curves northeasterly and has an at-grade crossing with a Ohi-Rail railroad track. The highway curves towards the east and has an at-grade crossing with a Norfolk Southern railroad crossing. After the second railroad crossing the highway passes through East Rochester. After East Rochester US 30 passes through farmland and woodland, paralleling a Norfolk Southern railroad track.
US 30 has a four-way stop at an intersection with SR 9 and SR 644, in Kensington. SR 9 and US 30 head northeast concurrent heading towards Hanoverton. In Hanoverton SR 9 turns due north and US 30 continues northeasterly, before turning easterly. US 30 enters Lisbon and passes through residential properties. As the highway enters downtown the properties become more commercial in type. In downtown, US 30 has a traffic signal at SR 45/SR 164/SR 154. This intersection is the northern terminus for SR 164 and the western terminus for SE 154. SR 45/SR 154 contumelies east concurrent with US 30. The concurrency passes through a few more blocks of commercial properties, before entering residential properties. The concurrency with SR 154 ends, when US 30 and SR 45 turn southeasterly and SR 154 continues easterly. The highway leaves Lisbon and passes through woodland as a two-lane highway. US 30 turns easterly and SR 45 continues towards the south, just before an interchange with SR 11.
US 30 enters SR 11 and the concurrency heads towards the southeast, as a four-lane divided highway with limited access, passing through woodland. The route has an interchange at SR 7, this is the northern end of the SR 7 concurrency. The highway enters East Liverpool and has an interchange with SR 7 and SR 39. This interchange is the southern terminus of the SR 7 concurrency and the western end of the SR 39 concurrency. The road curves towards the east and parallels the Ohio river and Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. The highway curves towards the northeast and has an interchange with SR 39, the eastern end of the concurrency with SR 39. US 30 and SR 11 curve towards the southeast and cross over the railroad tracks, before crossing the Ohio River on the Jennings Randolph Bridge, and into West Virginia, with SR 11 ending at the state line.
History.
The Lincoln Highway was the first route to follow the corridor of US 30 in Ohio. The Lincoln Highway was established in 1913, following the current route of SR 309 and SR 81. Improvements and realignment to the highway were planned in 1917 and was to start in the spring of 1918. The route was built to relive some of the railroad congestion. The Lincoln Highway realignment project was completed in 1939 and moved the Lincoln Highway to the modern US 30 corridor. The Lincoln Highway in Ohio became known as SR 5 between Indiana state line and Mansfield, SR 10 between Mansfield and Wooster, and SR 5 between Wooster and Pennsylvania. In 1925, the Federal Highway Association was established and one year later US 30 was established. US 30 followed the current route of SR 309. US 30 eastern terminus in Ohio was relocated to the West Virginia state line, in 1928. The route became divided in 1932, with US 30N taking the current alignment of US 30 and US 30S taking the current alignment of SR 309.
The bypass around the south side of Dalton was completed in December 1953. In 1966 and 1967 a four-lane section of US 30 opened between SR 49 and US 224. US 30 became a four-lane highway between Indiana state line and SR 49 in 1969. Between 1970 and 1971, US 30 between Delphos and Beaverdam was completed. In 1971 the section of road between current SR 172, West of East Greenville, and SR 21 was open to traffic. The divided routes were removed in 1974 with US 30S, becoming SR 309 and US 30N becoming US 30. In 1979 the section of four-lane road between Van Wert and Delphos open to traffic. Also in 1979 US 30 between Dalton and the I–77 interchange was upgraded to a four-lane divided highway and opened to traffic. Between 1983 and 1985 the section from I–77 to Trump Avenue was opened to traffic. In 1999 a four-lane section of US 30 was opened between SR 696 and SR 235. The highways between Upper Sandusky and Ontario was upgraded to a four-lane limited access highway and open in 2004 and 2005. During 2007 and 2008, the upgraded section of US 30 between SR 235 and Upper Sandusky, was opened to traffic.
Future.
The section of US 30 between Canton and SR 11 has been studied many times for upgrades since at least 1989. The route was studied several times between 1991 and 2001. The route was studied again was in 2010. In 2012, the ODOT is studying the section again, with plans to create a toll highway along the corridor.

Congregation Beth Israel (Berkeley, California)

Congregation Beth Israel () is a Modern Orthodox synagogue in Berkeley, California. Established in 1924 as the Berkeley Hebrew Center, it traces its origins to the First Hebrew Congregation of Berkeley, founded in 1909. It was Berkeley's first synagogue and remains its oldest. Lay-led for four decades, it hired its first rabbi, Saul Berman, in 1963.
Berman served until 1969, and was succeeded by Yosef Leibowitz, who served for 15 years. During the 1980s and early 1990s Beth Israel was at the vanguard of the "baal teshuva" movement in Modern Orthodox Judaism.
In 1999 the congregation began an $8 million fund-raising campaign to build a new synagogue, a replica of the Przedbórz Synagogue, destroyed in Poland by the Nazis, during the Holocaust in 1942. Difficult economic times restricted fundraising efforts, and instead the congregation completed a more modest structure in 2005. , the rabbi was Yonatan Cohen.
Early years.
Congregation Beth Israel was established as the Berkeley Hebrew Center at 1630 Bancroft Way, the first, and still-oldest synagogue in Berkeley, California. Though the cornerstone was laid in 1924, the congregation traces its roots back to 1909, when Rabbi Martin Meyer, also rabbi of San Francisco's Congregation Emanu-El, founded the First Hebrew Congregation of Berkeley. From 1913 to 1916 Meyer's disciple Louis I. Newman served as rabbi. During this period, small groups of Jews would rent space above stores in downtown Berkeley for "Shabbat" and holiday services. In 1924, under the name "Berkeley Hebrew Center", members of the First Hebrew Congregation of Berkeley built their first permanent home at the corner of Bancroft and Jefferson Streets.
Though during its first decades the synagogue was lay-led, in its early years it received significant guidance and support from Meyer and Newman, both Reform rabbis. Nevertheless, the congregation was quite traditional; the kitchen was kosher, members covered their heads, the traditional prayer book was used. While the Friday night services "resembled Reform practice... the High Holiday services were clearly closer to Orthodox practice."
Post World-War II growth.
In the 1950s and 1960s Beth Israel benefited from an influx of students and faculty from University of California, Berkeley. Many of the graduate students had grown up in Orthodox homes, and many of the faculty were becoming more observant. These new members organized "Shabbat" services, and "pressed for the hiring of a rabbi". In 1963 Beth Israel decided to hire its first rabbi, an Orthodox one, and chose Saul Berman, who had been ordained by the Modern Orthodox Yeshiva University. Berman increased levels of observance in the organization, and turned the sometimes sporadic Sunday school into a more educationally rigorous three-times-a-week Hebrew school. This in turn attracted new families to the congregation. Berman would serve until 1969, and go on to become "a leading voice of modern Orthodoxy."
Berman was succeeded by Yosef Leibowitz; Beth Israel was his first pulpit. Leibowitz would serve for fifteen years, before moving to Israel in 1984, and was succeeded first by Joseph Ozarowski, then by Manny Forman. During this period Beth Israel became one of the "flagship" synagogues of "baal teshuva" movement in Modern Orthodoxy, the adoption of Orthodox observance by "highly educated, prosperous, professional young people, mainly from non-Orthodox backgrounds, and often with meager Jewish educations".
Eliezer Finkelman served as rabbi from 1992 to 2000, before moving to the East Coast of the United States. He was succeeded by Yair Silverman, a Montreal native who had lived in Israel for five years, and served in the Israel Defense Forces for a year, before being ordained by Yeshiva University in 1999.
New building.
In 1999 the congregation began a campaign to construct new building; the old building had only one room, a very low ceiling, no air conditioning, and was "seismically unsafe". The plan was to build a replica of the Przedbórz Synagogue in Poland, considered to be among the most beautiful of the Polish-Lithuanian wooden synagogues, and burned down by the Nazis in 1942. Costs had initially been budgeted at $8 million, but fundraising was slowed by collapse of the dot-com bubble and the economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks. The project was scaled back to $3.5 million in 2002, and then abandoned in March 2003, after only $2 million was raised.
Earlier that year, in January, the congregation acquired its first new Torah scroll in its 75 year history, at a cost of $40,000. The synagogue already had three Torah scrolls, but they had been acquired used in the 1950s. Though repaired over time, "due to wear and tear" they were becoming unusable.
The following year construction began on a new building that looked similar to the previous one. During its construction, which was on the existing lot, services were held in various temporary locations. Completed in 2005, the design included a replica of the Przedbórz synagogue's "intricately carved" wooden charity box, and wooden floors and ceilings. While the facade was cement, the roof, almost 30 feet high, was constructed of western red cedar. The sanctuary had seating for 176 people, and the back wall separating the sanctuary from the social hall could be raised by a pulley system, creating one large combined room. At the time, the congregation had 165 member families.
Recent events.
Silverman returned to Israel in 2006, and was replaced by Yonatan Cohen. Cohen, a native of Israel who grew up outside Tel Aviv, had moved with his family to Montreal when he was 10. Though his parents were not observant, Cohen became more-so, aligning first with the Conservative movement, and then studying at the "Modern Open Orthodox" Yeshivat Chovevei Torah in New York, headed by Rabbi Avi Weiss. 
Rabbi Max Davis, a 2008 graduate of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, joined the congregation that year as Rabbinic Educator. He earned his Masters in Jewish Education from Yeshiva University in 2009, and in August 2010 he moved to Congregation B'nai Torah of Springfield, Massachusetts.
, the rabbi was Yonatan Cohen.

The Sunne in Splendour

The Sunne in Splendour is a historical novel written by Sharon Kay Penman. Penman became interested in the subject of Richard III while a student and wrote a manuscript that was stolen from her car. She rewrote the manuscript which was published in 1982.
Background.
As a student, Penman researched and wrote "The Sunne in Splendour" that chronicled the life of Richard III. When the 400-page manuscript was stolen from her car, Penman found herself unable to write for the next five years. She eventually rewrote the book and by the time the 936 page book was published in 1982 she had spent 12 years writing it, while practicing law at the same time.
"The Sunne in Splendour" is about the end of England's Wars of the Roses. In the book, Penman characterizes King Richard III as a good, but misunderstood, ruler. She chose to write Richard's character this way after becoming fascinated with his story and researching his life, both in the US and in the UK, which led her to believe that "his was a classic case of history being rewritten by the victor". Penman rejects the common belief that Richard killed the "Princes in the Tower," the sons of his brother King Edward IV, and attributes their deaths to the overly ambitious Duke of Buckingham.
Plot summary.
The story begins in 1459 with Richard as a young boy, and ends in 1485 with his defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field.
When their father is killed, Richard's older brother Edward leads the House of York to victory and becomes king as Edward IV.
Edward dies prematurely at age 40, and Richard becomes the Protector of the Realm for Edward's sons, Edward and Richard. Richard learns of his Edward's previous secret marriage, which makes Edward's marriage to the boys' mother, Elizabeth Woodville, illegal. Edward's children are therefore illegitimate, and Richard is the rightful heir to the throne. Elizabeth's brother, Anthony, Lord Rivers, plots to crown young Edward without Richard's knowledge. Richard has no choice but to end his protectorship and assume the throne.
Soon after Richard is crowned, both his son, Edward, and his wife, Anne, die. After two years as king, he faces his greatest challenge from an army of French mercenaries led by Henry Tudor, the future King Henry VII. At Bosworth, Richard is betrayed by two of his nobles, and left in a perilous situation. Outnumbered, Richard's small group is surrounded and gradually pressed back against the marsh. Richard's banner man—Sir Percival Thirwell—loses his legs but holds the Yorkist banner aloft until he is hacked to death. Short after this, Richard himself is killed a few feet from Henry.

Mount Cooper

Mount Cooper is located within Bundoora Park, a large (180 ha) public park, in the Melbourne suburb of Bundoora, and peaks at 137 meters above sea level. Mount Cooper is accessible by car via Mount Cooper Scenic Drive.
In at least one publication the peak is called "Mount Prospect", or "Bundoora Hill", but the height appears to have been recorded incorrectly at 102.5m. Greswell Hill, a smaller rise to the east is referred to by the same source as Mount Sugarloaf, however its given height, at 132m, strangely matches more closely that of the present Mount Cooper.
Mount Cooper was named for prominent early landowner, Horatio Cooper who was an assistant to Robert Hoddle during the first land sale of Melbourne. His property was called Norris Bank and a park still remains with this name in Bundoora.

Yankees (album)

Yankees is an album of improvised music by Derek Bailey, John Zorn & George Lewis. The album was originally released as an LP on the Celluloid label in 1983 and has been subsequently reissued on CD by Celluloid (from a vinyl source) and on the Charly label (from the original master tape). It is the first recorded meeting of John Zorn and Derek Bailey. The pair would later release the album, "Harras", with William Parker in 1993. Zorn and Lewis would collaborate further on "News for Lulu" (1988) and "More News for Lulu" (1993) with Bill Frisell.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by "Blue" Gene Tyranny awarded the album 4 stars stating "A collective improvisation by Derek Bailey on acoustic and electric guitars, George Lewis on trombone, and John Zorn on alto and soprano saxes, clarinets, and game calls. Subtle, droll, hilarious takes on the trivia of baseball sounds: Lewis speaks through the trombone "ball one, ball one..." There are snippets of a slipping and sliding version of "Take Me out to the Ball Game" and so on. Sections are titled "City City City," "The Legend of Enos Slaughter," "Who's on First," followed by "On Golden Pond," a tongue-in-cheek tone poem of the flora and fauna and mosquitoes. "The Warning Track" is about a very tiny railroad system.". "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" awarded it three and a half out of four stars, calling it "a hugely welcome reissue of an almost forgotten classic":A collaborative trio no doubt this was, but both Zom and Lewis have made clear their admiration and debt to Bailey and it is the guitarist who as often as not defines the parameters of these five excellent tracks. The two long items, 'The Legend of Enos Slaughter' and 'On Golden Pond', are both indicative of Zorn's great skills as an improviser; not just a pasticheur or ironist, he is also a first-rate saxophone player, an aspect of his artistic personality that tended to be overlooked in the period between this record and the later Masada project. Lewis is a giant, a player with a huge tone, a complex grasp of higher harmonics and, like Zorn, a dedicated deconstructor of his instrument, constantly experimenting with his component elements: mouthpiece, bell and slides. It's Bailey, though who makes things happen. His acoustic and amplified playing is tight marshalled, fierce and never less than expressive. His first entrances on the opening 'City City City' are breathtaking, and anyone who takes the plunge and samples this now mid-price disc could well find it a taste-altering experience.

Box Head Revolution

Box Head Revolution is a 2002 science fiction film directed, produced, edited and co-written by Mark Christensen. 
Plot.
On an unknown planet in an uncertain time, a two-tiered society has taken shape. The ruling class live above ground and wear masks on their faces, while the working class labors below the surface of the planet. The lowest order of the underground culture – prisoners, revolutionaries and various troublemakers – are forced to wear boxes locked around their heads. One day, an alien craft crashes on the planet. Gritt (Adom Cooper) and Brythle (Jenny Kim), a pair of rebellious young lovers from the upper tier of the planet's society, discover the wreckage. Unknown to them, the wreckage is a Voyager program space craft that was launched from the U.S. in the 1970s. Within the wreckage is a long-playing gold album featuring rock music of the 1970s. Despite the efforts of the ruling class to destroy this album, the young lovers are able to broadcast the music to the planet's oppressed masses. With this musical discovery, the planet faces a sudden and unstoppable turn of events that brings about the eponymous uprising.
Production and reception.
"Box Head Revolution" was the filmmaking debut of Mark Christensen, who was a dancer, a pilot, a skateboarder, and a musician before turning to cinema production. In the film’s press notes, he stated he turned to filmmaking because he felt "it would be easier to communicate his ideas through film rather than struggling with a song."
"Box Head Revolution" was shot on a very low budget in black-and-white digital video, and the cinematography was intentionally out of focus. Dave Kehr, reviewing the film for "The New York Times" noted, “Mr. Christensen's use of very blurry black-and-white video serves a double purpose. It disguises the complete absence of sets while lending the film the quality of decaying contraband from the indefinite past.”
"Box Head Revolution" had its theatrical premiere in New York City on August 21, 2002, and reviews were mixed. Edward Havens, writing for the online magazine FilmJerk.com, stated the film "is the most audacious directorial debut to invade American cinemas in a very long time. It's not the best film debut, nor the best looking or most intelligent. And the funny thing is, after watching the film, I don't think Mr. Christensen cares if you like it or not." David Sterritt, reviewing the film for "The Christian Science Monitor", commented that the film's "story is almost incoherent, but there's a weirded-out charm to Christensen's visual style – part German Expressionism, part 'Captain Video,' part early David Lynch – all as hazy as a half-remembered dream." But Ken Fox, writing for TV Guide Online, noted: "The onscreen text is riddled with typos, the migraine-inducing B&W photography is often over-exposed and out of focus, the post-synchronized sound is badly looped and Christensen himself can be heard directing his actors. Adventurous — and forgiving — lovers of strange celluloid could do worse. Others will no doubt find the whole experience the longest 76 minutes of their lives." And Shaun Sages, writing for the Movie Navigator online site, found the film to be "weirder than anything you’ll stumble upon watching 4 a.m. Sci Fi Channel programming."
To date, "Box Head Revolution" has not been commercially released on DVD.

Miss Conception

Miss Conception (original title "Buy Borrow Steal") is a 2008 comedy film directed by Eric Styles and starring Heather Graham. Graham plays a woman who learns she has only one month left to conceive a child. When her baby-phobic long-term boyfriend (Tom Ellis) goes to film a documentary on a remote island with a spoiled former supermodel, she is forced to find alternate ways to conceive with the help of her friend Clem (Mia Kirshner).
The film was produced by Miromar Entertainment and Blue Angel Films.
Plot.
Georgina Salt (Heather Graham) is a young English contractor living in London who longs to have a baby, which she sees as the one thing missing from her life. In the opening scene, Zach, Georgina's long-time boyfriend, is talking on the phone with his sister, who has just had a baby girl. Georgina is obviously more interested in the baby than Zach. After Zach gets off the phone, the couple goes back into their bedroom where Georgina seduces Zach. Zach, however, uses a condom, much to the dismay of Georgina.
The next day, Georgina goes shopping for a present for Zach's sister's baby with her mother. Georgina is taken away by the baby items around her and is saddened by it. When a doctor's ad for his clinic for women who want to get pregnant, but may not be able to conceive for much longer, Georgina's mother mentions her aunt. Presuming that her aunt was a lesbian, Georgina was never surprised that her aunt had no children, however her mother informs her that she was simply unable to have children; she was too late.
A frantic Georgina spends £150 on a blanket, to the surprise of her mother, before leaving the store. At Zach's sister's house, Georgina is taken by the baby and is allowed to hold her as Zach goofs off with his sister's belly sculpture. After breaking the sculpture, Zach blames it on her three-year-old son and the couple soon leave.
In the car, Georgina gets upset with Zach over the statue and she is about to ask him a question before he cuts her off saying, "I do not hate babies." Georgina jumps to the conclusion that he does hate babies and demands that he pull over and lets her out. Zach goes to a friend's house to 'crash' while Georgina heads home.
Prior to this event, Georgia had gone to the clinic to see how many eggs she had left; her best friend Clem goes with her and receives the call that the two of them are to return. The doctor informs Georgina that she only has one egg left and that she'd be ovulating for four days. The two women go out on a 'date' with a young man named Justin, who is completely taken aback when Georgina announces that she has one egg left.
Clem and Justin help Georgina form a plan to sleep with a random stranger. On day one, Georgina has an "open house" to rent out her apartment in order to lure men inside. The first few are turned away due to their looks or their gender preference. Finally, a man of great quality comes along, however just before he and Georgina kiss, Zach calls.
Georgina kicks the man out and talks to Zach, Alexandra, however says, "Zach, darling, will you zip me up?" An angry Georgina hangs up the phone and Zach isn't too pleased with Alexandra. Alexandra is the daughter of a rich man who is funding Zach's latest documentary; she is also the reason why Georgina was unable to speak to Zach before he left for a trip.
On day two, Georgina goes to a funeral to pick up a man overcome with "emotions" and isn't thinking too well. She takes him back to her apartment, leaves to get wine and as she is in the kitchen he discovers her "PLAN" sheet that has all the details about her seducing him on it. He is disgusted and leaves, as Georgina tries to explain herself.
Day three, Georgina finds herself with Clem at a night club. They see a very good looking young man, dancing very seductively and attracting all the girls' attention, and Georgina goes to seduce him. Before successfully seducing the man, she rips her dress in several places to make herself more sultry.
At the hotel, Georgina is about to go all the way with him, before she excuses herself to go to the bathroom. While she is taking out her breast pads and washing her mouth out, he steals some of her money and a card before leaving. Georgina comes out to find the lights off and him gone. After cursing her stupidity – and noticing her money and card gone – she goes home.
During this time, Zach is seen trying to hurry back to London and has to take the ferry because Alexandra had taken the last ticket going to London. Georgina and Clem purchase sperm from the Internet and go out to buy a turkey baster. At this time, Georgia reveals to Clem that she only wants Zach, before she says that she can't believe that the future father of her child is a turkey baster.
Georgina, seeming desperate at this point, turns to one of her employees who reveals that he is infertile just before the two of them can have sex. She then plans to go through with the artificial insemination, reading the directions as the sperm arrives. Her mother arrives with a birthday cake and Georgina accidentally squirts the sperm on the cake. Clem intends Justin, her so-called pet, to impregnate Georgina. A nervous Justin doesn't seem to want to go through with it. They go to a hotel room and Justin can't seem to get off, nor is he comfortable with this idea. Justin can't do it and backs out.
She begins to spank him, before she is thrown out of the hotel by the staff. She runs into a friend of Zach's and is comforted by him. While hugging him, Zach walks in and assumes that they are having an affair and slaps his friend before leaving. Georgina runs after him, but loses him. She misses her chance to get pregnant and mopes around because she lost both her chance to have a baby and Zach.
Ben, Zach's friend, comes over to check on Georgina and the two begin to talk about how awkward the situation was just as the doorbell rings. Clem gets it and turns out that it's Zach, who is outraged to find Ben and Georgina holding hands. He slaps Ben again, who, in turn, punches Zach. The two have a scuffle, during which Ben tells Zach that while Georgia is OK, she isn't Clem. Clem, hearing this, asks him to repeat that and after establishing that he likes Clem and not Georgina, he gets off Zach and goes to Clem.
Georgina asks about Alexandra, who Zach admits is beautiful, but says that isn't all he looks for in a person. She isn't impressed by his reasoning, however Zach continues on trying to explain that he loves her and had never stopped. Zach reveals that he wants children too, however an upset Georgina leaves and Ben has to explain to Zach what had been going on. At work, Georgina's worker reveals that he understands why she left and leaves before Zach comes in with a dozen roses.
Four months later, while Georgina is running her breasts and belly feel sore and goes to a clinic for a pregnancy test. She receives a call informing her that she is, in fact, pregnant. At a birthday party for Zach, it is revealed that they are engaged and Georgina tells him that she’s pregnant. Zach is overjoyed about the news.
Critical reception.
As of March 21, 2011, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 8% of critics rated the film positively based on 12 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 33 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating a generally negative response.

Chaenactis artemisiifolia

Chaenactis artemisiifolia, with the common name White pincushion, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family. It is native to the coastal Peninsular Ranges of Southern California and Baja California, in the chaparral and woodlands. 
Description.
The "Chaenactis artemisiifolia" is a robust annual herb producing an erect stem occasionally as tall as two meters-6 feet but usually under one meter-3 feet in height. There is a basal rosette of leaves and sparse leaves along the stem. The leaves are up to about 15 centimeters or more in length and they are divided into many lobes which are further subdivided into smaller, lacy lobes. The leaves and stem are lightly woolly; older plants have thinner coats of hair. 
The stem branches about midway up and bears several flower heads in a wide open inflorescence. Each head is a hairy hemispheric cup of sharp-tipped phyllaries which can be up to a centimeter long. The flower heads are discoid, containing only disc florets, but some of them are flat enough to resemble ray florets or petals. The florets are white to pink. The anthers and curly styles protrude far from each floret, making the flower head look like a pincushion. The fruit is a compressed achene about half a centimeter long with no pappus.

Little Rock, Arkansas

Little Rock is the capital and the largest city of the U.S. state of Arkansas. The Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had a population of 717,666 people in the 2012 census estimate. The MSA is included in the Little Rock-North Little Rock, AR Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 893,610 in the 2012 census estimate. As of the 2010 US Census, Little Rock had a city proper population of 193,524. It is the county seat of Pulaski County.
Located near the geographic center of Arkansas, Little Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the Arkansas River called "la Petite Roche" (French: "the little rock"). The "little rock" was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The "little rock" is across the river from "big rock," a large bluff at the edge of the river, which was once used as a rock quarry.
There have been two ships of the United States Navy named after the city, including USS Little Rock (LCS-9).
History.
Origins.
Archeological artifacts provide evidence of Native Americans inhabiting Central Arkansas for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. The early inhabitants may have included the Folsom people, Bluff Dwellers, and Mississippian culture peoples who built earthwork mounds recorded in 1541 by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Historical tribes of the area included the Caddo, Quapaw, Osage, Choctaw, and Cherokee.
Little Rock was named for a stone outcropping on the bank of the Arkansas River used by early travelers as a landmark. "La Petite Roche" (French for "the Little Rock"), named in 1721 by French explorer and trader Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe, marked the transition from the flat Mississippi Delta region to the Ouachita Mountain foothills. Travelers referred to the area as "the Little Rock," and the landmark name stuck.
Geography.
Little Rock is located at (34.736009, −92.331122).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.52%) is water.
Little Rock is located on the south bank of the Arkansas River in Central Arkansas. Fourche Creek and Rock Creek run through the city, and flow into the river. The western part of the city is located in the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains. Just northwest of the city limits are Pinnacle Mountain and Lake Maumelle, which provides Little Rock's drinking water.
The city of North Little Rock is located just across the river from Little Rock, but it is a separate city. North Little Rock was once the 8th ward of Little Rock. An Arkansas Supreme Court decision on February 6, 1904, allowed the ward to merge with the neighboring town of North Little Rock. The merged town quickly renamed itself Argenta (the local name for the former 8th Ward), but returned to its original name in October 1917.
Climate.
Little Rock lies in the humid subtropical climate zone, with hot, humid summers and mild winters, with usually little snow. It has experienced temperatures as low as , which was recorded on February 12, 1899, and as high as , which was recorded on August 3, 2011.
Neighborhoods.
Inside Little Rock's city limits, there are numerous different neighborhoods. They are Apple Gate, Birchwood, Breckenridge, Broadmoor, Brodie Creek, Candlewood, Capitol View, Capitol View/Stifft's Station, Chenal Ridge, Cloverdale, Colony West, Downtown, East End, Echo Valley, Fair Park, Geyer Springs, Gibraltar Heights, Granite Mountain, Gum Springs, Hall High, The Heights, Highland Park, Hillcrest, John Barrow, Leawood, Mabelvale, Mushroom Pass, Oak Forest, Otter Creek, Parkway Place, Pleasant Valley, Quapaw Quarter, River Mountain, River Ridge, Riverdale, Robinwood, Rock Creek, Rosedale, St. Charles, Santa Fe Heights, South End, South Little Rock, Southwest Little Rock, Stagecoach, Sturbridge, the Villages of Wellington, Wakefield, West End and Woodland Edge.
Capitol View/Stifft's Station.
Capitol View/Stifft's Station is a neighborhood in Little Rock, located in the west central portion of the city encompassing approximately 1500 homes. Roughly, its boundaries include the area south of West Markham, north of Interstate 630, east of Pine, and west of Summit, as well as south of Riverview between Park and Summit. Capitol View/Stifft's Station is just west of Downtown, north of the Central High School Historic District, Southeast of Pulaski Heights and uses the 72205 ZIP code. The Capitol View/Stifft's Station neighborhood is the result of Little Rock's early 20th century westward growth. Located west of the Arkansas State Capitol, Capitol View and Stifft's Station were the combined result of numerous additions to, what was at the time, western Little Rock.
The architecture of the neighborhood is predominantly Craftsman, Craftsman Bungalow, and Bungalow with modest Tudor or Colonial Revival detailing. One may also find Shotgun Houses, Queen Anne or American Foursquare-styled homes, as well as various period revival influences including Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture. The dominance of these styles in the neighborhood reflects its principal growth period of 1920 to 1929, with roughly 40% of building stock constructed within this decade. Combined with construction undertaken in the 1930s, this period accounts for the majority of housing stock built within the neighborhood. Although construction of Interstate 630 in the 1970s dramatically altered the southern edges of the area, the neighborhood is largely intact and much of the original housing stock remains.
There are architecturally and historically significant structures and sites which merit preservation and protection within the area. Two structures in the area are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the T.R. McGuire House and Lamar Porter Field. The neighborhood also contains two historic districts, The Capitol View Historic District and the Stifft Station Historic District. As of 1996, approximately two percent of the City of Little Rock's residents called the Capitol View/Stifft's Station area home. The racial distribution within the neighborhood is similar to that of the city: approximately 34 percent black and just under 65 percent white. However, also like the city, the neighborhood is subdivided geographically into different socio-economic zones. An example of this stratification is that almost 52 percent of the households in the area are classified as low and moderate income; however, the westernmost quarter of the neighborhood is over 61 percent low and moderate income, while 60 percent of the "Johnson – Woodrow area" households are higher income.
Over 53 percent of the Capitol View/Stifft's Station area households were at an income level, in 1990, between $10,000 and $30,000. This compares to 38.1 percent of the households in Little Rock while, at the upper end, only 9.6 percent of households in the area had incomes over $50,000. The citywide percent of households with incomes over $50,000 was 22.2 percent in 1990.
The population profile of the neighborhood, in 1996, showed an area more middle-aged than that of Little Rock (residents aged over 65 and less than 18 both represented a lesser percentage than that of the overall city population). In addition, the female population is slightly larger in the area than citywide (54.4 to 53.6 percent). Single parent households also account for a greater percentage of neighborhood households than citywide. All of the increases in single parent households come from female headed households. For the city, 11.4% of households are single parent homes.Family and household sizes are generally smaller in Capitol View/Stifft's Station than compared with the rest of the city. This is due in part to the high percentage of one person households (41.8 percent compared to 32 percent city wide). The neighborhood is overwhelmingly single family at over 63 percent.
The Central Arkansas Transit Authority provides bus service in and through the neighborhood. One Downtown to West Little Rock route travels Markham Street to Kavanaugh Boulevard providing residents access to both Downtown and the Rodney Parham Road area. Bus routes along 7th Street and Capitol Avenue provide access to the West Markham Street area and the Otter Creek Neighborhood. The bus system is radial, downtown to the outskirts and back, much like the spokes of a wheel. Therefore, to go east, north, or south, the rider must first go downtown and transfer. The Capitol View/Stifft's Station neighborhood has a service level as good as any residential area in metropolitan Little Rock.
Capitol View/Stifft's Station has no fire stations, either historic or modern, within its boundaries. One surmises that this area’s fire protection needs were served, initially, by either Fire Station #3, which was opened at 3515 12th in 1911, or Fire Station #7, in operation by 1916 at Beechwood and Prospect (now Kavanaugh).
East Little Rock.
Predominantly industrial in development, East Little Rock generally refers to most portions of Little Rock located east of Interstate 30. The low-lying easternmost end of Arkansas' capital city is marked by distribution facilities and warehouses, Clinton National Airport and its environs, the Port of Little Rock, and various manufacturers. A small amount of residential areas can also be found dispersed throughout East Little Rock, progressing towards census-designated places including College Station and Sweet Home. Industrial use of this area started as early as 1917, when the US government contracted with a chemical company to produce picric acid to sell to the French government for weapons. Labor was brought in from other states and Puerto Rico.
Physically and economically, East Little Rock often contrasts sharply with the newest, westernmost neighborhoods of Little Rock. The two parts of the city are linked via Interstate 630, which has its first west-bound access near East 15th Street.
Part of East Little Rock has received tremendous attention since the late 2004 opening of the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park near the banks of the Arkansas River. Development and subsequent opening of the facility and its adjoining Clinton School of Public Service, affiliated with the University of Arkansas, has served as a catalyst in plans to further improve its immediate area along the riverfront and downtown's River Market District. The next major addition for East Little Rock, the new headquarters of Heifer International adjacent to the Clinton library campus, opened on January 30, 2006.
Mabelvale.
Mabelvale was a small, unincorporated train station town in southwestern Pulaski County until being annexed into Little Rock in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The area today is part of Little Rock's seventh ward, while retaining a separate postal designation and ZIP code from most of the rest of the city. The neighborhood is currently represented on Little Rock's City Board of Directors by Brenda "B.J." Wyrick. The neighborhood is generally defined as the homes and businesses in the immediate area surrounding the intersection of Mabelvale Main Street and the Union Pacific railroad line. Its location on the south-central fringe of Little Rock proper — as well as proximity to unincorporated communities, neighborhoods in Southwest Little Rock and adjoining towns such as Shannon Hills which share the ZIP code — often leads to varying definitions of Mabelvale's boundaries.
The Heights and Hillcrest.
The Heights and Hillcrest are neighborhoods in the north-central portion of Little Rock. Although distinct today, they were once part of the same Little Rock suburb called Pulaski Heights. Pulaski Heights first developed in the 1890s, was incorporated in 1903, and was annexed by Little Rock in 1916.
Today, The Heights is an upper-middle-income residential neighborhood. It is marked by boutiques and restaurants along Kavanaugh Boulevard, St. John's Seminary, and the Country Club of Little Rock. Hillcrest likewise centers around a section of Kavanaugh Boulevard. It is sometimes described as the "funkier" cousin of The Heights. Its landmarks include Mount St. Mary Academy, Allsopp Park, several major churches, and restaurants and bars.
Chenal Valley.
A sizable and more recently developed section of the city, Chenal Valley is in the west-central section of Little Rock, known as West Little Rock. Its name is derived from the area's Shinall Mountain, but Deltic Timber Corporation, a major early developer of the area, opted to alter the name to mimic French language as part of a strategy (known as foreign branding) to orient the residential and commercial development toward upper-class population segments. Chenal Valley is one of the more expensive residential areas in Little Rock with typical homes in the $200,000 to $2,000,000 price range.
The main thoroughfare is Chenal Parkway, mostly a divided four-lane path chiefly connecting Highway 10 to west Little Rock's Financial Centre business district. Chenal Parkway's northwestern terminus is just north of Highway 10 at Highway 300, near the Pinnacle Valley neighborhood. The southeastern terminus lies at Autumn Road at a transition to Financial Centre Parkway, with continuation to a conversion into Interstate 630 at Shackleford Road.
Chenal Valley is known for its rapid development since 1990, when Chenal Country Club was established and some of the earliest of the area's current crop of homes were built. Those and other residences, including a limited number of apartment and condominium complexes, can be found scattered throughout a part of Little Rock that has for now retained much of its pre-development wooded areas.
Several mass-market retailers populate Chenal's eastern commercial corridor near the Financial Centre area, including industry leaders Wal-Mart, Kroger, Target, Home Depot and Barnes & Noble. Chenal is also home to the headquarters of the Nuvell unit of GMAC Financial Services, an important employer for the city overall.
Quapaw Quarter.
The Quapaw Quarter of Little Rock is a section of the city including its oldest and most historic business and residential neighborhoods. The name of the area was first given in 1961, honoring the Quapaw Indians who once lived in the area centuries ago.
As many as fifteen separate National Historic Register Districts make up the Quapaw Quarter, including more than 200 separate homes and buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. Trapnall Hall, situated along East Capitol Avenue, was among the first of the homes built in 1843 as the home of early state legislator Frederic Trapnall and his wife, Martha. Structures housing businesses on Main Street and Broadway south of Interstate 630 are among this group as well.
Throughout the Quapaw Quarter, many small and large homes from the Antebellum and Victorian eras can be found, in addition to several examples of Craftsman-style architecture. Scott, Center and Spring streets, in particular, are where many such homes stand today. The exterior of the Villa Marre, one such home, was known nationally as the outside of the home containing the office of Sugarbaker Designs, the fictional Atlanta-based interior design firm on the CBS sitcom "Designing Women." The actual home is located along Little Rock's Scott Street, and has been a former home for the office of the Quapaw Quarter Association, the chief organization that sponsors historic preservation efforts in the area.
Governor's Mansion District.
Along with the Villa Marre, the exterior of the Arkansas Governor's Mansion was also featured on "Designing Women", shown as the home of Suzanne Sugarbaker. The mansion and its grounds comprise a city block, dividing Center Street in its 1800-numbered block, and anchor the city's Governor's Mansion Historic District, encompassing many homes and businesses along and around lower Broadway. The first official residence of Arkansas's governors opened on January 10, 1950, to a week-long open house for all Arkansans. The Georgian Colonial Revival home was renovated and expanded from 2000 through 2002, reopening for the inauguration of Mike Huckabee's second full term as governor in early 2003.
The MacArthur Park Historic District, dedicated in 1981, adjoins the city's MacArthur Park along East 9th Street, including the Arkansas Arts Center and the circa-1840 Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal. This building in the district contains the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur, a foremost commander of American forces in the Pacific Theater during World War II.
South Main Residential Historic District.
The South Main Residential Historic District — nicknamed SoMa by some area locals — was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 according to the Department of Arkansas Heritage. The district which runs along South Main Street between 19th and 24th streets is notable for its assortment of quality late-nineteenth and early twentieth century residential architecture, including specifically the Queen Anne, Craftsman and Colonial Revival styles.
Riverdale.
Located adjacent to the Arkansas River, Riverdale is a neighborhood of Little Rock situated in the north-central area of the city. It lies to the northeast and at a lower elevation from Pulaski Heights, and to the northwest of downtown.
Riverdale contains a considerable amount of warehouses in the eastern part of the neighborhood, served by Union Pacific rail lines that travel through the area. The warehouse section is flanked on the east by the corporate headquarters of Dillard's Department Stores, and noted for the landmark restaurant and bar, Cajun's Wharf, one of many such businesses with a long presence in Little Rock.
The neighborhood progresses westward toward shopping areas, office complexes, and upscale residential communities. Part of the lure to Riverdale in recent years for shoppers has been an increased emphasis on design-oriented businesses, with retailers offering antiques, ceramics, fine fabrics, plants and specialty lighting fixtures. Accompanying these shops is a popular mix of restaurants skewing toward Southern and Italian cuisine.
Beyond shopping venues, soccer fields and corporate towers inch the neighborhood toward the riverfront. Regional headquarters for telecommunications providers Verizon Communications and Windstream Communications, as well as the non-profit service organization Winrock International, are among the companies whose executives broker deals here. A combination of gated communities, apartments and condominiums buffer the corporate corridor from Rebsamen Golf Course, the city's largest public golf course, and Murray Park to the far west along Riverfront Drive.
Government.
The city has operated under the city manager form of government since November 1957. In 1993, voters approved changes from seven at-large city directors (who rated the position of mayor among themselves) to a popularly elected mayor, seven ward directors and three at-large directors. The position of mayor remained a part-time position until August 2007. At that point, voters approved making the mayor's position a full-time position with veto power. The current Mayor is Mark Stodola, a former Little Rock City Attorney and prosecuting attorney. The current City Manager is Bruce T. Moore, who is the longest-serving City Manager in Little Rock history. The city employs over 2,500 individuals in 14 different departments, including the Police Department, the Fire Department, Parks and Recreation, and the Zoo.
Most Pulaski County government offices are located in the city of Little Rock, including the Quorum, Circuit, District, and Juvenile Courts; and the Assessor, County Judge, County Attorney, and Public Defenders offices.
Both the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit have judicial facilities in Little Rock. The city is served by the Little Rock Police Department.

The campuses of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences are located within Little Rock. The city also is home to a pair of smaller, historically black colleges, Philander Smith College, affiliated with the United Methodist Church, and Arkansas Baptist College.
The University of Arkansas at Little Rock was founded in 1927 as Little Rock Junior College, under the supervision of the city Board of Education. The first semester open, there were eight instructors and about 100 students. The college is currently accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, a status it has kept since 1929. Housed originally in public school buildings, the college moved in 1949 to its present location between University Ave and Fair Park Blvd, North of Asher Ave., on land donated by Raymond Rebsamen, a Little Rock businessman. The college was also the sole beneficiary of a continuing trust established by former Governor George W. Donaghey at the time. In 1957, the institution began a four-year degree program, became independent and privately supported under a separate board of trustees, and took the name Little Rock University.
In September 1969, The Little Rock University merged into the University of Arkansas System, to create the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. The University of Arkansas System merger began a period of steady growth, which saw UALR go from about 3,500 students and 75 full-time faculty members in 1969 to about 10,000 students and over 400 full-time faculty members in the 1998 academic year. The University's expanded offerings now include 54 undergraduate major programs, an extensive schedule of night, weekend, and off-campus classes, and a wide range of community educational services. UALR began offering graduate and professional work in 1975. Besides the juris doctor offered at the William H. Bowen School of Law, UALR now has three doctoral programs and 29 graduate and professional programs, as well as joint programs with other campuses of the University of Arkansas System.
The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is part of the University of Arkansas System.

Maud Franklin

Maud Franklin (9 January 1857 – ca. 1941) was an English artist and the mistress of and model for artist James McNeill Whistler. 
Franklin was born in Bicester, Oxfordshire, England, one of six children of Charles Franklin, an upholsterer and cabinetmaker, and Mary Clifton, after whom she was christened 'Mary'. She may have posed for Whistler as early as 1872, as a stand-in for his portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland, when she was fifteen. 
By the late 1870s she was serving as a model to Whistler for etchings and painted portraits, most notably the "Arrangement in White and Black". She also was the initial model for what would be the "Portrait of Miss Florence Leyland", as well as "Harmony in Grey and Peach Colour", numerous other oils, drawings, watercolors, etchings, and lithographs.
Franklin had two daughters by Whistler: Ione (born circa 1877) and Maud McNeill Whistler Franklin (born 1879). She sometimes referred to herself as 'Mrs. Whistler', and in the census of 1881 gave her name as 'Mary M. Whistler'.
She was not always well treated by Whistler; at the time of his libel trial with John Ruskin in January 1879 he left Franklin, then pregnant, in a London hotel under the pretense that he was in Paris.
Following Whistler's bankruptcy later that year she accompanied him to Venice, but was not accepted into society. In the 1880s her health suffered, and she was the subject of watercolors by Whistler depicting her in bed.
During the 1880s she exhibited her own artwork at the Grosvenor Gallery under the pseudonym Clifton Lin, and at the Society of British Artists. 
After Whistler married Beatrice Godwin in 1888, Franklin moved to Paris. She married a New York man named John A. Little; in 1904 he died, and around 1911 Franklin married another American, Richard H.S. Abbott, and lived near Cannes until her death.

Bujoreni Monastery

Bujoreni Monastery (Mănăstirea Magarului) is an Orthodox monastery in Bujoreni Village, Zorleni Commune, Vaslui County, Romania.
The monastic settlement was set up in the 16th–17th centuries (a. 1602), as a convent of the Bujoreanu family, on their property bearing the same name, in a secluded place in the forest.
The legend says that the church was built by the monetary contribution of some shepherds who arrived from the mountains to spend the winter, on the place of an old oak, where a donkey knelt various times, and into the hollow of which was found an icon representing the Virgin Mary and Child. It is said that this icon, capable of performing miracles, was hidden by the monks from the nearby Recea Monastery, which was destroyed during the Tartar incursions around 1440.
The convent’s church, patronized by the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, was reconstructed using wood at the end of the 18th century by the chancellor Gavril Conachi, owner of the property, and was rebuilt from the wall by his son, the monk Ioanichie Conachi around 1840. After the death of its founder, the convent was maintained by his niece, Ruxanda Rosnovanu, who inherited the Zorleni and Bujorenii estates. In 1911, the convent was maintained by the Royal House, by the Administration of the Zorleni estate, becoming royal property from 1883. Damaged by the earthquake in 1940, the church was restored, and was in use until 1958, when the convent was deconsecrated. In 1993, monastery status was reinstated. Between 1994–2002, the assembly was completed by new cells and other household dependencies, the precinct being surrounded by a stone fence. Placed in a natural picturesque background and well organized as a household, the monastery may provide services of ecumenical tourism.
The church was renovated in 2001–2002. It keeps the three-apse plan, with a semicircular altar apse and a belfry tower to the west. It shelters the tomb of its founder in a niche in the wall between the nave and narthex.

American carrion beetle

The American carrion beetle ("Necrophila americana", formerly "Silpha americana") is a North American beetle of the family Silphidae. It lays its eggs in, and its larvae consume, raw flesh (particularly that of dead animals) and fungi. The larvae and adults also consume fly larvae and the larvae of other carrion beetles that compete for the same food sources as its larvae.
Range.
The beetle lives in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, with its southern boundary from eastern Texas to Florida and the northern boundary from Minnesota to southeastern Canada including New Brunswick and Maine.
Appearance.
Adults are 12 to 22 mm long. The pronotum is primarily a pale yellow with a black spot in the center. In the southern portion of the range, the elytra are entirely black while in the northern portion they have a yellow rear tip. The elytra are shorter than the body of the beetle, leaving the tail end slightly exposed. The larvae are black and appear armored.
Lifecycle.
From spring through fall, during daylight, a few hours after flies begin arriving at a carcass, the adult beetles will arrive as well. They immediately begin eating the already hatching fly larvae, mating, and laying their own eggs. As long as the carcass lasts, the adults will remain eating competitors to give their own larvae a chance to eat and grow. Upon hatching from the eggs, the larvae will eat both the carcass and other larvae that are within it. Eventually the larvae will fall to the ground, dig into the dirt, and pupate. Overwintering is done by adults.
Mutualism.
The beetle is known to engage in mutualistic phoresis with mites of the genus "Poecilochirus". Upon arrival at a carcass, these mites drop from the beetle and begin eating the eggs and larvae of the flies that preceded the beetles (and continue to lay more eggs even as the beetles are active). They will eventually return to the adults and be transported to the next carcass. Some of their young will hitch a ride with the beetles' young upon their emergence from the pupal stage.
In popular culture.
In a 2006 episode of entitled "Necrophilia Americana", "Necrophila americana" is incorrectly stated to be the beetles found on a body. The beetles are also later erroneously referred to as being in the family Dermestidae.

<doc id="18520388" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18520388" title="Afro-Costa Rican">
Afro-Costa Rican

Afro-Costa Ricans are Costa Ricans of African ancestry.
Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattos, Blacks, Amerindians and Asians. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans. Most of them are English-speaking descendants of 19th-century black Jamaican immigrant workers.
History.
The first black people who arrived in Costa Rica came with the Spanish conquistadors. Slave trade was common in all the countries conquered by Spain, and in Costa Rica the first blacks seem to have come from specific sources in Africa- Equatorial and Western regions. The people from these areas were thought of as ideal slaves because they had a reputation for being more robust, affable and hard-working than other Africans. 
The slaves were from what is now the Gambia (Mandingas), Guinea (specifically Wolofe), Ghanaian (Ashanti), Benin (specifically Ije / Ararás) and Sudan (Puras). Many of the slaves were also Minas (i.e. slaves from parts of the region extending from Ivory Coast to the Slave Coast), Popo (be imported tribes as Ana and Baribas), Yorubas and Congas (perhaps from Kongasso, Ivory Coast). Slaves also came from other places, such as neighboring Panama.
During the 17th century, the elite from the then capital city of Cartago invested in cacao farms in Matina, in the Atlantic region. Black slaves worked and lived in these farms, isolated from the rest of the country; the owners only went to oversee the crops once a year. 
However, the following century witnessed a gradual lessening of the differences between blacks and their white owners. As whites took black women as their concubines, they freed the children that were born from this union. The same thing started to happen with the "zambos", born of Amerindians and blacks. During the time of slavery, the slaves worked on cattle ranches of Guanacaste and the Central Valley plantations and cacao plantations in Matina, whose situation was more difficult. Over time, many whites freed their slaves and slavery was abolished in 1823, along with the other Central American countries.
The largest Costa Rican black community is from the Caribbean, which today constitutes the majority of the Costa Rican black population. Costa Rica has the largest Jamaican diaspora after Cuba and Panama and its development as a nation is witness to his contribution.
Since 1850, fishermen of Afro-Caribbean origin began to settle in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, especially from Panama and the West Indies. They stayed in temporary camps during fishing seasons, from March to September, to plant coconuts, cassava, and yams, which were then harvested the following season. Since 1828, some of these fishermen began to settle in Costa Rica permanently with their families.
Towards the second half of the 19th century, coffee became the main export of Costa Rica. The crops were transported from the Pacific Coast, by an inaccessible jungle terrain of the Atlantic Coast. To be taken to Europe, they had to turn back to South America, which increased the cost and removed competitiveness . To remedy this situation, in 1871 a railway and a port on the Atlantic Coast were constructed. Because of the scarcity of local labor, workers were imported from Italy, China, and the Caribbean and Central America. This coincided with an employment crisis in Jamaica that caused an exodus to neighboring countries. So on December 20, 1872 the "Lizzie", the first boat from Jamaica, arrived at the port of Limón with 123 workers to work on the railroad. From this moment, the number of Jamaican workers in Limon increased rapidly and the next year already saw over 1,000 Jamaican workers in the port, mostly of Ashanti origin.
Many Jamaicans intended to return home, but most remained in the province of Limón on the Caribbean Coast. In 1890 the railways suffered a financial crisis, forcing many workers to sustain themselves by working in agriculture. This in turn saw the laborers establishing relationships and cultural exchanges with native populations of these areas. Later, the Jamaican workers began working for the banana industry, whose production grew to its peak in 1907.
Usually these workers lived on the plantations and had little knowledge of Costa Rica beyond their immediate environment. The contact was minimal because the Costa Rican banana plantations were in foreign hands. They did not speak Spanish and retained Jamaican customs. They had their own schools with teachers brought from Jamaica. Until 1949 Costa Rica had segregation laws similar to the South African Apartheid, where Blacks lived exclusively in the Caribbean Province of Puerto Limón. By 2011 Afro-Costa Ricans were spread in all 7 Costa Rican provinces: 32% of them in San José, 16% in Alajuela, 15% in Limón, 10% in Heredia and 8% in Cartago and Guanacaste. Today, Afro-Costa Ricans are part of different disciplines and fields in Costa Rica. 
Demographics.
Three per cent of the population are Afro-Costa Rican, compared to 1% who are Amerindian. In the Guanacaste Province, a significant portion of the population descend from a mix of local Amerindians, Africans and Spaniards. Most Afro-Costa Ricans are found in the Limón Province.

Battle of Lipantitlán

The Battle of Lipantitlán, also known as the Battle of Nueces Crossing, was fought along the Nueces River on November 4, 1835 between the Mexican Army and Texian insurgents, as part of the Texas Revolution. After the Texian victory at the Battle of Goliad, only two Mexican garrisons remained in Texas, Fort Lipantitlán near San Patricio and the Alamo Mission at San Antonio de Béxar (modern-day San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas). Fearing that Lipantitlán could be used as a base for the Mexican army to retake Goliad and angry that two of his men were imprisoned there, Texian commander Philip Dimmitt ordered his adjutant, Captain Ira Westover, to capture the fort.
The commander of Fort Lipantitlán, Nicolás Rodríguez, had been ordered to harass the Texian troops at Goliad. Rodríguez took the bulk of his men on an expedition; while they were gone, Westover's force arrived in San Patricio. On November 3, a local man persuaded the Mexican garrison to surrender, and the following day the Texians dismantled the fort. Rodríguez returned as the Texians were crossing the swollen Nueces River to return to Goliad. The Mexican soldiers attacked, but the longer range of the Texians rifles soon forced them to retreat. One Texian was injured, 3–5 Mexican soldiers were killed, and 14–17 were wounded.
The injured Mexican troops were allowed to seek medical treatment in San Patricio, and the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated to Matamoros. The Texians now had full control of the Texas Gulf Coast, which meant that the troops stationed at San Antonio de Béxar could only receive reinforcements and supplies overland. Historian Bill Groneman believes that this contributed to the eventual Mexican defeat at the siege of Béxar, which expelled all Mexican troops from Texas. The former site of the fort is now a Texas historic site.
Background.
Fort Lipantitlán was built on the grounds of an old campsite along the west bank of the Nueces River on the Gulf coast of Texas. The site was first occupied by a nomadic Lipan Apache tribe during their periodic visits. After the Apaches abandoned the area, the campground was often used by missionaries, military units, and traders making their way between Mexico and the Texas settlements. In 1825 or 1826, Mexican officials constructed a makeshift fort, named Lipantitlán after the Lipan Apaches, at the campsite. According to Texian John J. Linn, the fort "was a single embankment of earth, lined within by fence rails to hold the dirt in place, and would have answered tolerably well, perhaps, for a second-rate hog pen". The embankment was surrounded by a large ditch; just outside the ditch lay adobe and wooden huts for the officers and their families.
Between 80 and 125 soldiers from the 2nd Active (Cavalry) Company of Tamaulipas were garrisoned at the fort. They collected customs duties and provided protection to San Patricio, a small settlement of Irish and Mexican colonists approximately south. Smaller garrisons were located at Copano Bay and Refugio, with a larger force stationed at Presidio La Bahía in Goliad.
In 1835, federalists in several interior Mexican states revolted against the increasingly centralist reign of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna. The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June, and wary colonists soon began forming militias, ostensibly to protect themselves. Fearing that strong measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered General Martín Perfecto de Cos to lead a large force into Texas; Cos arrived in Texas on September 20.
The Texas Revolution officially began on October 2 at the Battle of Gonzales. Within days, Texian insurgents seized Presidio La Bahía, located at Goliad. Twenty Mexican soldiers escaped and briefly took refuge at Copano and Refugio; those garrisons soon abandoned their posts and joined the larger force at Fort Lipantitlán. The Mexican soldiers at Lipantitlán began improving the defenses of their small fort. As the only remaining garrison on the Texas coast, Fort Lipantitlán was a vital link between the Mexican interior and Béxar, the political center of Texas which housed Cos and the only other force of Mexican troops in Texas.
Captain Philip Dimmitt assumed command of the Texians at Presidio La Bahía. In a letter to General Stephen F. Austin dated October 15, Dimmitt proposed an attack on Fort Lipantitlán, whose capture would "secure the frontier, provide a vital station for defense, create instability among the centralists, and encourage Mexican federalists". Most of the federalists in San Patricio were afraid of retaliation if they openly defied Santa Anna's centralist policies. They were also reluctant to hold elections for delegates to the Consultation, which would decide whether Texians were fighting for reinstatement of the Constitution of 1824 or for independence from Mexico. Soldiers at Lipantitlán had also imprisoned two of Dimmitt's men, John Williams and John Toole, as they tried to deliver missives to the federalist leaders in San Patricio on October 10 and 11. Dimmitt hoped to free the men after capturing Fort Lipantitlán.
On October 20, James Power, one of the Irish empresarios who had helped to found San Patricio, learned that the Lipantitlán soldiers had been ordered to retake Presidio La Bahia. Two hundred cavalry were expected to reinforce the Lipantitlán garrison before the attack, with an additional 200–300 soldiers expected later. Although Dimmitt forwarded the intelligence to Austin, he was not given authorization to attack. The delay proved costly to Williams and Toole, who were marched to the Mexican interior, beyond the reach of the Texians. According to Dimmitt's angry letter to Austin, Toole begged his captors to kill him outright rather than send him on the march, which he believed would still result in his death. Dimmitt concluded, "this news, after the leniency shown to the prisoners taken here, could not fail to create a lively, and a strong excitement. The men under my command are clamorous for retaliation".
Prelude.
The furor over the removal of Williams and Toole likely led Dimmitt to take matters into his own hands. On October 31 he sent a member of his staff, Adjutant Ira Westover, to take 35 men to attack Fort Lipantitlán. A self-appointed advisory committee—John J. Linn, Major James Kerr and Power—rode along. The three advisors had been elected to the Consultation but delayed their departure so that they could participate in the fighting.
Rather than riding directly southwest to the fort, Westover travelled southeast to Refugio. This alternative route was likely intended to suggest that the expedition was headed for Copano Bay. An unknown number of men joined the expedition in Refugio; historian Craig Roell believes that the expedition grew by at least 20 men, and historian Bill Groneman estimated that Westover's force numbered 60–70 men when it reached San Patricio.
Meanwhile, the commander of the garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, Captain Nicolás Rodríguez, received orders to harass the Texians at Presidio La Bahía. On October 31, as Rodríguez and his men neared Goliad, they learned that a Texian force had left the fort earlier that day. The Mexican soldiers immediately retraced their route. They did not encounter any Texian soldiers during their march and arrived on November 1 to find the fort unmolested. Uncertain as to what the Texians intended to do, Rodríguez and the bulk of his garrison (almost 80 men) turned back towards Goliad to attempt to intercept the Texians. Between 21 and 27 soldiers, armed with two cannon, remained to defend the fort.
Battle.
Rodríguez expected the Texians to take a direct route. his men patrolled the northern approaches to the fort. Westover's men instead approached from the east, eluding the Mexican patrols. Five miles (8 km) from San Patricio, Westover received word that Rodríguez was searching for the Texians. He forced the men to increase their pace, and they arrived at San Patricio 30 minutes after sundown on November 3. Westover positioned two small groups of men to guard the Nueces River crossings, about from the fort. As the rest of the Texians prepared for a dawn assault, two San Patricio residents wandered into their camp. Westover arrested one of them, James O'Riley, for "aiding and assisting the enemy". In exchange for his liberty, O'Riley offered to persuade the Mexican garrison to surrender. Historians have no records of what methods O'Riley used, but by 11 pm the Mexican soldiers had surrendered, without a shot fired. They were released immediately as long as they promised not to fight again during the Texas Revolution. The Texians captured the two 4-lb (1.8-kg) cannons, 18 muskets, and 3–4 pounds (1.4–1.8 kg) of powder. They also released several Texians who had been held prisoner in the fort.
The following day, Texians burned the wooden huts adjacent to the fort and dismantled the embankments. By 3 pm they had rounded up 14 horses and were preparing to bring the cannons back to Goliad. In the meantime, Rodriguez had travelled almost all the way to Goliad. Before he reached Presidio La Bahía, one of his spies arrived with news that the Texians had taken Fort Lipantitlán. Rodriguez and his men—including 10 colonists from San Patricio—marched back toward the fort, arriving at about 4 pm.
The Texians used a small canoe to transport men across the Nueces River, and when the Mexican soldiers were sighted only half of the Texian force had crossed to the east bank of the river. As the Mexican soldiers attacked, the Texians took cover in a grove of trees. The trees prevented the cavalry from approaching, so Rodriguez's men dismounted and attempted to attack from both sides. The Texian rifles had a much longer range than the Mexican Brown Bess muskets— compared to . After 30 minutes of fighting, the Mexicans withdrew, leaving behind 8 horses and several wounded men. The only Texian injured was Lieutenant William Bracken, who lost three fingers. Texian rifleman A. J. Jones later wrote to Fannin that 3 Mexicans had died with 14 wounded, though historian Stephen Hardin believes that 5 Mexicans died with 17 wounded. Jones's letter mentioned that three of the wounded were the "alcade", judge, and sheriff of San Patricio.
Aftermath.
Without draft animals, the Texians had no easy way to transport the artillery. As night approached, a cold rain began to fall, and the men became discouraged. Westover, Kerr, Linn, and Power agreed to throw the artillery in the river rather than continue to struggle with it. The Texians also deposited their cache of captured ammunition and muskets in the river; in their opinion, the supplies were useless.
Most Texians spent the night in San Patricio, housed by sympathetic locals. The Mexican troops camped outdoors near the battle site. At dawn, Westover agreed to allow the wounded Mexican soldiers to be transported to San Patricio for treatment. The following day one of the wounded soldiers, Mexican Lieutenant Marcellino Garcia, died. Garcia was a personal friend of Linn, and the Texians gave him a full burial with honors.
Westover sent a messenger to Rodríguez to request "another pleasant meeting". Rodríguez declined the offer and retreated with his remaining men to Matamoros. Their departure left only one remaining group of Mexican soldiers in Texas, those under General Cos at Béxar. The Texians now controlled the Gulf Coast, and so all communication between Cos and the Mexican interior must be transferred overland. The long distance involved severely slowed the delivery of messages and receipt of supplies and reinforcements. According to Groneman, this likely contributed to Cos's defeat in the siege of Béxar, which expelled the remaining Mexican soldiers from Texas.
On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Agustín Viesca, the recently deposed governor of Coahuila y Tejas. Several months before, Viesca had been imprisoned by the Mexican army for defying attempts by Santa Anna to disband the state legislature. He and members of his cabinet had been liberated by sympathetic soldiers and immediately travelled to Texas to recreate the state government. Westover and his men provided a military escort to Goliad, arriving on November 12. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison; many supported the governor, while others believed that Texas should be an independent country and should therefore not recognize the Mexican governor.
Dimmitt later chastised Westover for not following orders during the expedition. Westover refused to make an official report to Dimmitt. Instead, he sent a written report to Sam Houston, the commander-in-chief of the regular army. In Westover's opinion, "The men all fought bravely and those on the opposite bank of the river were enabled to operate on the flanks of the enemy above and below the crossing which they did with fine effect." Houston lauded "the conduct and bravery of the officers and men who have so handsomely acquitted themselves in the affair and so deservedly won reputation for themselves and Glory for their Country". This was the first armed skirmish fought since the Battle of Goliad, according to historian Hobart Huson, the victory "renewed the morale of the people". News of the battle spread throughout the United States, and the Texians were widely praised in American newspapers.
The removal of Mexican army oversight encouraged federalists in San Patricio. These men soon gained control of the municipal government, formed a militia, and elected delegates to represent them at the Consultation. However, the town remained divided; many still supported the centralist Mexican government. After reaching Matamoros, Rodríguez sent a letter to the town leaders. The letter warned that the Mexican army would return and encouraged the people of San Patricio to repudiate the rebellion. One of the San Patricio federalists later wrote Dimmitt, "We have neither men nor means to withstand any force that may be sent against us." The Texians chose not to garrison men in or near San Patricio. In 1836, as part of Santa Anna's invasion of Texas, General José de Urrea led Mexican forces along the Texas coastline and retook San Patricio on February 27.
In 1937, the land comprising the former site of Fort Lipantitlán was donated to the state of Texas. The Texas State Parks Board gained control over the site in 1949. Now named the Lipantitlan State Historic Site, the park covers in Nueces County. A stone marker indicates the location of the former fort.

Ming C. Lowe

Ming C. Lowe (born October 13, 1945) is an American painter of large-scale contemporary works on canvas and a fine art photographer. She emerged from the most embryonic 1960s rock 'n' roll scenes to become a unique voice in the Southern California desert, where her home was a gathering place for like-minded, creatively driven individuals of all genres of the arts seeking a place of peace and inspiration amid the turbulence of what was called the counter-culture. 
After her work attracted and served as a source of inspiration for the likes of Eric Burdon of the Animals, Paul Butterfield, Sterling Morrison of the Velvet Underground, American Indian guitar legend Jesse Ed Davis and James Gurley of Big Brother and the Holding Company, Lowe moved from Palm Desert to the nearby Santa Rosa Mountains and began producing photographic art inspired by visits to working and abandoned Midwest steel mills; the living, breathing waterfronts of San Diego; the juke joints of the Mississippi Delta, and images of the 9/11 in catastrophes in New York and Washington, D.C..
The significance and vitality of her art is growing in national recognition as the underground she once nurtured becomes more mainstream. Today, her work can be seen in the catalogs of Fortune 500 business and national museums and art galleries.
Biography.
Lowe was born in Washington, D.C.. Her mother, Choral Lowe, named her Ming after her attraction to Ming Dynasty art. It may have seemed a strange, non-conformist act in 1945 mainstream America, but Lowe considered it her mother's greatest gift. 
Lowe's grandfather, a successful businessman, owned homes in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the beach town of La Jolla, California. Lowe grew up in both cities, excelling in swimming and tennis. But she was largely ignored by her parents. There was never a breakfast before school. No money for lunch. No toys. No movies. No hugs. No "I love yous." A different school every year. Lowe tested with an I.Q. of 143 and showed early signs of artistic talent. But she was not encouraged to pursue any of her passions. Her parents divorced when she was 12, launching Lowe on a journey of boarding schools and public schools from Arcadia, California to Las Vegas to Salt Lake as her mom remarried, divorced and remarried again. Left alone with her grandparents in Salt Lake, Lowe easily passed the University of Utah's college boards exams, but dropped out of the 11th grade when her grandparents went to Europe. Lowe then headed west to California. She wanted to be a beatnik. She had her own car and a pack of unfiltered Camel cigarettes.
Birth of a counter-culture.
Lowe returned to La Jolla in 1961 as a shy 15½-year-old red head with a passion for more cerebral jazz, folk and blues. She met a group of guys from Windansea Beach and joined them in the youth culture they created around surfing and beer bashes. With her fake ID, she rented a studio apartment in Pacific Beach and paid the rent with a $100 child support check from her father. She supplemented her income working at the first Hobie Surfboard Shop in San Diego County for Chuck Hasley, a former school teacher who would lead the Windansea team to victories in surf competitions. Lowe, who answered their fan mail, also participated in the surfer group, the Mac Meda Destruction Company. She got pregnant just before the city discovered she was a 17-year-old truant. She moved to Palm Desert, where her mother and stepfather were publishing Desert Magazine. Her mother signed her marriage license and gave them a $100 gift. They divorced in 1966 after having two daughters, Sloane and Portia Perry. Lowe retained her married name, Ming Perry, and remained a part of the La Jolla scene while raising her daughters as a single parent. Tom Wolfe spent a summer in La Jolla and skimmed the surface of its "underground society" in his 1965 book, "The Pump House Gang." Lowe was more integral to the real scene, helping her friend, Anchovie Barca, turn the Hippodrome ice skating rink into the Fillmore West of San Diego. She had a party with a blues band playing in her living room and police raided it for disturbing the peace. Twenty-one of Lowe's friends were arrested after police reported finding marijuana and peyote in the house of "Mrs. Ming Perry, a 21-year-old divorcee and mother of two children", according to the San Diego Union. Lowe recalled hearing herself called "the Dragon Lady" on radio. The counter-culture became prominent across the U.S. in 1966. Lowe was visiting a friend on the Sunset Strip when the riot broke out that inspired Stephen Stills to write "For What It's Worth." She was invited in 1967 to the Monterey Pop Festival by Cass Elliott of the Mamas and the Papas, whose boyfriend was a surfer from Windansea. She was in the front row at the Altamont Festival when the West Coast scene came to a violent end during a set by the Rolling Stones. Other prominent figures from the 1960s, including comedian Jonathan Winters, English rocker Eric Burdon, Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison, Native American guitarist Jesse Ed Davis, blues legend Taj Mahal, and actors Brad Douriff from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and Teddie Markland from "Wanda Nevada", began showing up at her back door after Ming bought a house in Palm Desert in 1967. The now posh destination was still part of the desert frontier when Ming built her own studio there. When Palm Springs had its own rock festival in 1969, about 60 friends slept on the floor and roof of Ming's house. Burdon called it "a great meeting place for artists and travelers attracted to the desert."
The art.
Lowe was a self-taught artist. An experience she had at a friend's art class at age 8 influenced her to pursue art. Perhaps because of her parents’ deprecations, Lowe did not consider herself a real artist. Then, at age 29, she had her first one woman show at a gallery in Palm Desert. People who saw her work began giving her commissions, one of which resulted in a large-scale portrait of a Maasai warrior. Her portraits, ranging from jazz and rock subjects to the Utah execution of Gary Gilmore, often revealed a punk boldness and strength. She had her first show of paintings in 1978 in Long Beach, California, followed by many Palm Springs-area exhibitions. Her international collectors included many of her famous friends. But Lowe always sought to duplicate the feel of that childhood art class. There was an energy in that large, empty room with one big painting on a large easel. She built her own gallery on her Palm Desert property in the mid-1980s and captured that energy by placing her large paintings on big canvases in open rooms. Her gallery also served the community with free screenings of surreal films by Luis Buñuel, attracting the likes of avant garde composer Ernst Krenek and underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger. Soon, Lowe was recognized as a vital artist by reviewers and a unique personality by a newspaper columnist who covered Palm Springs celebrities. When she needed more space and privacy than Palm Desert could afford, Lowe moved to the mountain community of Pinyon and used her self-taught architectural and construction skills to design and build a multi-dimensional house and furniture to give her home the energy her art demanded. With her art now properly housed, Lowe gained the confidence to travel and experiment in photography. She was in the top floor of the Hotel Washington across from the White House when a terrorist-piloted jet crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11. She was photographing the smoke from the crash when President Bush's helicopter emerged from the smoke to land on the White House lawn, giving Lowe a powerful image. Recognizing the history of the moment, Lowe got into the restricted areas of Ground Zero in New York to capture the breadth of the national disaster. She then juxtaposed the photos with images of Muslim culture taken from her international travels for a compelling show that somehow found a universalism in all the lines and angles titled "Here and there. 911."
Fascinated by the geometric spirituality of her images, Lowe began a cross-country tour of steel mills and industrial Americana after designing her own custom motor home. Many of the anthropological-yet-ballet-like images she photographed were pledged to U.S. Steel in Gary, Ind. Before Lowe could do any more with these pieces, she was commissioned in 2006 to photograph the San Diego waterfront for the Port Authority's Art in Public Places program. The year-long project resulted in a 30-photograph essay, "Shift Change: The Working Waterfront", which opened at the Balboa Photography Museum. It has been shown at museums throughout San Diego County.

Euclid's Nightmare

"Euclid's Nightmare" is an album of improvised music by Bobby Previte and John Zorn. The album was released on the Depth of Field label in 1997. The album comprises 27 untitled tracks of which several are intentionally identical - tracks (7) and (18); tracks (3) and (20); and tracks (5), (14), and (27).
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 3 stars stating "Here, Previte hears Zorn insistently and responds with short, crisp rim shots, rolling tom-toms, and scattershot cymbal runs that tend to stretch out the time, turn it loose from its constraints inside the work, and move forward into whatever frame Zorn chooses next. For his part, Zorn hears the thrumming of the cymbals and decides to speed up the piece in order to match Previte's double time. They both arrive in the pocket at the same time and kick the energy into an overdriven state of chaotic -- yet jubilant -- free improv, where there are no ties to gravity at all until Previte introduces a tom-tom and Zorn responds with a gorgeous angular legato. This is only one of dozens of surprises on Euclid's Nightmare. Zorn fans will be familiar with the level of histrionics employed here, while followers of Previte's more refined work may be put off by the constant atonality of the work.".

Máximo Jerez

Máximo Jerez Tellería (6 June 1818 León, Nicaragua - 11 August 1881 Washington, D.C., USA) was a politician, lawyer and military leader in 19th century Nicaragua.
He is considered he the greatest Liberal political thinker in Nicaraguan history. He was a leader of the movement towards Central American unity.
Together with Francisco Castellón Sanabria, he participated in bringing to Nicaragua the filibuster of William Walker and on 31 October 1855 was designated Minister of Foreign Relations in Walker's provisional government, led officially by Patricio Rivas. He ran for the presidency in 1856, but no candidate obtained an absolute majority. By Walker's decision, provisional President Rivas summoned new elections on 10 March 1856, but countermanded the decree on 14 March, and broke relations with Walker.
On 23 January 1857 Jerez formed a dual Junta government with the Conservative Tomás Martínez and they acted jointly as Presidents of Nicaragua, him being the 34th, from 24 June 1857 to 19 October or 15 November 1857. In his subsequent career as Minister Plenipotentiary of Nicaragua to Costa Rica, he signed on 15 April 1858, the Cañas–Jerez Treaty that defined the boundaries between the two countries.
In 1876 he organized from El Salvador an expedition to overthrow the provisional government of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Alfaro, but failed.
In the city of León there is a statue in his honor.

Take Me on the Floor

"Take Me on the Floor" is a song by The Veronicas from their second album "Hook Me Up". It was released to radio stations as their second single in the United States on 24 March 2009. The song was used in promotional ads for the 2008 season of Australia's "Dancing with the Stars". A remix of Take Me on the Floor has been made by Pitbull.
Writing and inspiration.
The song was written by Toby Gad, Jessica Origliasso and Lisa Origliasso. 
Several lines of "Take Me on the Floor", specifically "I wanna kiss a girl, I wanna kiss a girl, I wanna kiss a boy", caused some controversy for its portrayal of sexuality. The video also stirred up controversy, as it depicts kissing scenes between girls.
Lisa states "Yeah, I reckon there's a sexual undertone to that song, but when we were writing it we were thinking about having fun, going to a club, being on the dancefloor. You can interpret it how you like."
Music and Structure.
"Take Me on the Floor" is an uptempo electropop-dance song. The song is set in Common time with an energy filled fast tempo of 138 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of E minor. The song begins with techno synths playing followed by breathy vocal, then progresses into fast tempo techno-dance beat played by guitars, synthesizer keyboards, and synthesized Tr-808 drums. Lisa and Jess's vocal range spans from A3-E5.
Lyrically, the song is about having fun on the dancefloor.
The song is also the first song to feature screams, which are performed by Jessica.
Critical reception.
Chris Williams of "Billboard" gave the song a positive review, stating "Their second single "Take Me on the Floor" finds the girls collaborating with writer/producer Toby Gad ("Big Girls Don't Cry") for an arresting, festive slice of dance/pop. A subdued vocal and synth intro bursts into the kind of electronica groove currently in favor thanks to Lady GaGa. The Veronicas concoct a club anthem whose lyrics and video may raise an eyebrow, surely with the hope of continued teen pop momentum for their second album, "Hook Me Up"." Epinions call the song a delivery of the most radio friendly disco, new wave and rock saying it would be a great song to just let go to in the dance clubs. Sheena Lyonais of CHARTAttack calls Take Me on the Floor "admittedly pure teenage party tracks, but impossible to respect"
Chart performance.
"Take Me on the Floor" peaked at number seven in its second week of release on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. In its ninth week, it was certified Gold (35,000+ sales) on digital downloads alone. It is their fourth consecutive single from "Hook Me Up" to reach top 10 in Australia. In the U.S., the single made its debut on the "Billboard" Pop 100 chart at number ninety-seven and has also so far peaked at 22 on the iTunes Top pop 100 chart and 62 on the iTunes top 100. As of 11 July 2009, it has peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at #81.
Music video.
The official music video for "Take Me on the Floor" premiered on 13 August 2008 on the Hot 30 Countdown website. The video begins with Lisa surrounded by lights singing in a club while everyone is dancing. Then both girls start singing the chorus of the song while in front of a blue background. It then shows a man walking into the club. After the chorus, Jess starts singing in front of a red window with Mandarin Chinese writing on it. It occasionally shows scenes with Lisa singing in front of the same backdrop throughout the verse. In the third verse, Jess finds a woman to dance with, and Lisa finds a man. Throughout the last chorus, it shows them with the men and woman dancing in the same club shown at the start. The song ends with both girls standing in front of the blue background again. 
Throughout the video it cuts to scenes where everyone is dancing as well as them singing in front of the lights and a red Mandarin Chinese backdrop, as well as several people kissing. Controversy arose when sections in the music video depicted 2 women making out in a mock doggy style position.
The international version of the music video was a live version shot on 24 February 2009 at the Palais Theatre in Melbourne on the Australian leg of the Revenge Is Sweeter tour. The video was released on their website on 1 May 2009.
Release history.
It was released as the fourth single from the album in Australia as a digital download on 27 July 2008. In the U.S. Warner Bros. hosted a poll for fans to vote through texting to decide which should be the second single in the U.S. "Take Me on the Floor" was then announced as the next single on their YouTube page and was released on 24 March 2009 to radio.

Mononymous person

A mononymous person is an individual who is known and addressed by a mononym, or "single name". In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a polynym ("multiple name"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today.
History.
Europe.
The structure of persons' names has varied across time and geography. In some communities, individuals have been mononymous; that is, each person has received only a single name. Alulim, first king of Sumer, is one of the earliest names known; Narmer, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, is another. Later, Biblical names were typically mononymous, as were names in the surrounding cultures of the Fertile Crescent. Ancient Greek names also followed the pattern, with second names only used to avoid confusion, as in the case of Zeno the Stoic and Zeno of Elea.
A notable departure from this custom occurred among the Romans, who by the Republican period and throughout the Imperial period used multiple names: a male citizen's name comprised three parts, "praenomen" (given name), "nomen" (clan name) and "cognomen" (family line within the clan) — the "nomen" and "cognomen" being virtually always hereditary. Post-antiquity most of them are, however, mononymous in most contexts: examples are Cicero (also known as Tully: Marcus Tullius Cicero), Pompey (Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus), Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro), Nero (Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) or Juvenal (Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis).
In other cultures the following can be named: Euripides, Xenophon, Aristotle and, further afield, Boudica and Jugurtha.
During the early Middle Ages, mononymity slowly declined, with northern and eastern Europe keeping the tradition longer than the south; an example is Edeko, the East Germanic chieftain whose son ruled Italy as Flavius Odoacer. By the end of the period, however, surnames had become commonplace: Edmund Ironside, for example, ruled England, Brian Boru was High-king of Ireland, Kenneth MacAlpin had united Scotland, and even in Scandinavia surnames were taking hold. The Dutch Renaissance scholar and theologian Erasmus is a late example of mononymity; though sometimes referred to as "Desiderius Erasmus" or "Erasmus of Rotterdam", he was christened only as "Erasmus", after the martyr Erasmus of Formiae.
The Americas.
Between Columbus' arrival in the New World and the late 19th century, most native Americans were mononymous. Examples include Agüeybaná (Puerto Rico, died 1510), Auoindaon (Canada, flourished 1623), Pocahontas (United States, 1595–1617), Guamá (Cuba, died 1532), Anacaona (Dominican Republic, 1464–1504), Moctezuma (Mexico, 1398–1469), Lempira (Honduras, died 1537), Diriangen (Nicaragua, fl. 1520), Urracá (Panama, died 1531), Tamanaco (Venezuela, died 1573), Atahualpa (Peru, 1497–1533), Cangapol (Argentina, fl. 1735), Lautaro (Chile, 1534–1557), and Tecumseh (United States, 1768–1813). Uniquely, the Dutch-Seneca diplomat Cornplanter was given both a Seneca language mononym (Kaintwakon, which roughly translates as "corn planter") from his mother and a given name and surname (John Abeel) from his father, and he used both throughout his life; however, his later descendants, such as Jesse Cornplanter, would instead use "Cornplanter" as the family name instead of "Abeel." In the 19th century, most chiefs involved in the Apache Wars had mononymous birth names, and some replaced those with mononymous nicknames: Geronimo (born Goyaałé), Victorio (born Beduiat), Cochise, and so on.
Post-medieval uses.
Since the medieval period, mononyms in the west have almost exclusively been used to identify notable people who already had surnames. These nicknames were either adopted by the persons themselves or conferred by contemporaries.
France.
Some French authors have shown a preference for mononyms. In the 17th century, the dramatist and actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73) took the mononym stage name "Molière".
In the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet took the mononym "Voltaire", for both literary and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris's Bastille, to mark a break with his past. The new name combined several features. It was an anagram for a Latinized version of his family surname, "Arouet, lj[eune"; it reversed the syllables of the name of a family "château", "Airvault"; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity with French expressions such as ""voltige"", ""volte-face"" and ""volatile"". "Arouet", on the other hand, would not serve the same purpose, given that name's associations with "roué" and with an expression that meant "for thrashing."
The 19th-century French author Marie-Henri Beyle used many pen names, most famously the mononym "Stendhal", adapted from the name of the little Prussian town of Stendal, birthplace of the German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, whom Stendhal greatly admired.
In the 20th century, a fourth French writer, Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (author of "Gigi", 1945), used her actual surname as her mononymous pen name, "Colette". 
Some French actors and singers, e.g., Trenet and Dani, have used their given name or surname as a stage mononym.
Other European countries.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, most Italian castrato singers used mononyms as stage names (e.g. Caffarelli, Farinelli).
The German writer, mining engineer and philosopher, Georg Friedrich Philipp Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772–1801), became famous as "Novalis".
The 19th-century Dutch writer Eduard Douwes Dekker (1820–87), better known by his mononymous pen name "Multatuli" (from the Latin "multa tuli", "I have suffered "borne" many things"), became famous for the satirical novel, "Max Havelaar" (1860), in which he denounced the abuses of colonialism in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). In 2002 Multatuli was proclaimed by the Society for Dutch Literature to have been the most important Dutch writer of all time. The Dutch writer Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1882-1961) wrote under the pseudonym Nescio (Latin for "I don't know").
The 20th-century British author Hector Hugh Munro became known by his pen name, "Saki".
In 20th-century Poland, the theater-of-the-absurd playwright, novelist, painter, photographer and philosopher Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz after 1925 often used the mononymous pseudonym ""Witkacy"", a conflation of his surname ("Witkiewicz") and middle name ("Ignacy").
In the Soviet Union, Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky are assumed names, for similar reasons. Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov adopted the pen name Lenin while publishing anti-Tsarist propaganda in the 1910s, and was generally known as Lenin (or sometimes V.I. Lenin) after rising to power in the October Revolution. Ioseb Besarionis Zhugashvili assumed the pen name Stalin, from the Russian word for "steel", and was also generally known by this name after the revolution. Similarly, Lev Davidovich Bronshtein assumed the name Leon Trotsky, which then became shortened over time to, simply, Trotsky.
A number of visual artists, such as Michelangelo, Titian, Tintoretto, Caravaggio and Rembrandt, are commonly known by mononyms. The modern Russian artist Erté formed his mononymous pseudonym from the initials of his actual name, as did the Belgian comics writers Hergé and Jijé.
Italian painter Bernardo Bellotto, who is now ranked as an important and original painter in his own right, traded on the mononymous pseudonym of his uncle and teacher, Antonio Canal (Canaletto), in those countries—Poland and Germany—where his famous uncle was not active, calling himself likewise "Canaletto." Bellotto remains commonly known as "Canaletto" in those countries to this day.
Mononymity was represented in photography, from that art's infancy, by Nadar (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon).
North America.
The American writer of non-fiction and fiction, Rodney William Whitaker (1931–2005), is best known for some novels that he wrote under the mononym pen name, "Trevanian". The Armenian-Canadian portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh was commonly known as "Karsh of Ottawa".
Royalty.
Monarchs and other royalty, for example Napoleon, have traditionally availed themselves of the privilege of using a mononym, modified when necessary by an ordinal or descriptor (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II or Charles the Great). However, this is not always the case; thus, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has two names. While many European royals have formally sported long chains of names, in practice they have tended to use only one or two and not to use surname. In Japan, the emperor and his family have no surname, only a given name, such as Hirohito, which in practice is rarely used: out of respect and as a measure of politeness, Japanese prefer to say "the Emperor" or "the Crown Prince." In India, the first six Mughal emperors were known by just one name, adopted by each emperor upon his accession.
Roman Catholic popes, except for John Paul I and II, have traditionally, on their election, adopted a single name.
Mononyms in modern times.
Countries where mononyms are normal.
The western style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (Christian name or forename) is far from universal.
In Asia.
In modern times, in countries that have long been part of the Chinese cultural sphere (Japan, Korea, Vietnam and China itself), mononyms are rare. A notable exception pertains to the Emperor of Japan. Mononyms are, however, common as stage names in the Japanese entertainment industry, usually when the performer's legal name is not publicly known; e.g., Ayaka, Becky, Gackt, hide, Hyde, Mana, Miyavi, Tsunku, and Yui. Also, Japanese baseball superstar Ichiro Suzuki is widely known in both Japan and North America simply as "Ichiro".
In Hong Kong, a few musicians are also known by mononyms, e.g., Janice, Jin, and Justin Lo (who uses the Chinese mononym, "側田"). 
In Korea, singers such as BoA, Rain, Zelo, Shoo and Psy are known by their mononyms.
Mononyms continue to be used in parts of India. Mayawati, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as Pran, Sridevi, Rekha, Kajol, Dharmendra and Rajnikanth, are also known only by their mononyms.
Mononyms are also common in Indonesia, especially in Javanese names. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents Sukarno and Suharto, the mononyms are the full legal name, as often among Javanese people of common birth. Other mononyms, such as Rossa, Chrisye and Tohpati, are stage names taken from a nickname or part of the full name.
Single names still also occur in Tibet and Mongolia. Most Afghans have no surname.
In Thailand, people usually address each other in informal situations by nicknames (chue-len or Thai: ชึ่อเล่น). Given by parents or relatives in early childhood, these nicknames are typically one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). They may often be nonsense words or humorous, and usually have no relation to the person's actual name, although in some cases may be diminutive forms of their first name, like "Nok" for "Noknoi" which means respectively bird and little bird, the first used as nickname and the second being the first name. All Thais have such a name, even the royal family, and they are freely used in everyday life.
Surnames were introduced in Turkey after World War I, as part of his westernizing and modernizing program, by that country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. His own surname, Atatürk, which was bestowed by the Turkish parliament, means "Father Turk."
In the West.
In the West, mononymity, as well as its use by royals in conjunction with titles, has been primarily a privilege of famous persons such as prominent writers, artists, entertainers, musicians and sportsmen.
Some persons, such as the artist Christo, the sculptor Chryssa, and the singer-songwriter Basia, have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community in which they were currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of self-identification, and so have used only a single part of their full names.
The case of the Icelandic musician Björk is similar, but her use of a single name also has roots in her native culture. Like most Icelanders, she has no family name; the second part of her full name is a patronymic. Icelanders generally address one another solely by given names even in formal settings.
Some mononym stage names are merely the performer's given name (e.g., Eve, Madonna, Prince, Ke$ha, Cher, Donovan, Beyoncé), while others may be the performer's surname (e.g. Liberace, Mantovani, Morrissey). Some mononym stage names are invented (e.g. Cantinflas, Xzibit), adopted words (e.g. Capucine, French for "nasturtium") or nicknames (e.g. Sting, Bono, Moby).
In Lusophone countries such as Portugal, Angola and especially Brazil, football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. Pelé, Nani, Ronaldo, Eusébio, Marta). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include nicknames (Michel, Arteaga, Arzú), derivations of the player's surname (Coro, Guti), diminutives (Juanito, Pichi), or the player's first names (Xavi, Sergi, Raúl). Because there are a few very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the Venezuelan Miku and the Ivorian Gervinho. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with notable examples including Brazilian basketball players Hortência and Nenê. 
The former president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is known simply as "Lula", a nickname he officially added to his full name. Such mononyms, which take their origin in given names, surnames or nicknames, are used because Portuguese names tend to be rather long.
Professional basketball players are commonly referred to by their first names, e.g., Lebron, Shaq, Magic, and Kobe. Michael Jordan is commonly referred to by his last name. 
The comedian and illusionist Teller, the silent half of the duo Penn & Teller, has legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller, to the mononym "Teller" and possesses a United States passport issued in that single name.
The professional wrestler Warrior legally changed his name to the mononym, Warrior.
Some have selected their mononym themselves, when they have been able to do so, because of its distinctiveness. Others have come to be known by a mononym that has been applied to them by some segment of the public. The public has referred to President George W. Bush by the mononym W, in distinction to his father President George H.W. Bush. Both mechanisms contributed in the case of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been called, and has publicly called herself, simply "Hillary". Peter Funt, of "Candid Camera", wrote in a February 21, 2007 "New York Times" op-ed piece, "The Mononym Platform": "Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. Clinton will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when Ike's P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'..." In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in Salon.com, the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as "Hillary" (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband Bill Clinton.
Oprah Winfrey, famed American talk show host, is usually referred to by only her first name, Oprah. In Canada, Senator Nancy Ruth had previously dropped her family name of Jackman, using both of her remaining names together as a mononym instead of using "Ruth" as a family name. She is alphabetized under "N," not "R", on the Senate website.
Omarosa, who is a reality television star born as Omarosa Manigault and later on married and became Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, now simply goes by Omarosa. She has gone by this in the television shows The Celebrity Apprentice and All-Star Celebrity Apprentice.
Some famous computer programmers are recognized by just the use of their first name. Examples are Linus and Ken.

22.5 cm Minenwerfer M 15

The 22.5 cm Minenwerfer M 15 was a heavy mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was developed by Böhler as an alternative to the German Ehrhardt 25 cm schwere Minenwerfer which Böhler was having problems building under license. It was a muzzle-loading, smooth-bore mortar that had no recoil system whatsoever. The entire mortar had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It was not particularly accurate and bombs often fell over in flight and landed on their sides which caused a lot of duds in soft ground. It fired high-explosive and gas shells. For transport two wheels from the Gebirgsgechütz M 99 were used.
The M 17 version of this weapon had an elevation screw with a double thread and reinforced trunnion bearings. It's unclear how the M 16 differed from the earlier model.

Bealings railway station

Bealings railway station was a station in Little Bealings, Suffolk on the line between Ipswich and Lowestoft. While the station was shut on 17 September 1956, the line remains open, and both the station building and platforms survive.
It was opened by the Eastern Union Railway on 1 June 1859 when the full East Suffolk Line opened between Great Yarmouth in Norfolk and Ipswich in Suffolk. In 1862 the Eastern Union Railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway who operated the station until 1923 when grouping saw the Great Eastern Railway taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway.
The July 1922 Bradshaw's Guide showed seven up services (towards Ipswich) and seven down services calling at the station, with two services each way on Sundays. Most services were local trains which would originate or terminate at Ipswich and call at most stations on the East Suffolk Line. However the station did enjoy a main line service direct to Liverpool Street. Bradshaw's stated that the 08:17 departure conveyed first and third class Pullman carriages (there was no second class at this time), arriving in Liverpool Street at 10:30. The return working was at 15:18, arriving back in Bealings at 17:22.
From 1916 the station was the railhead for Martlesham Heath Airfield. In 1919 the goods yard was recorded as having three roads one of which served a small goods shed (the building on the left-hand side of the picture).
After World War 2 the railways were nationalised and Bealings station became part of British Railways' Eastern Region. Lack of patronage saw the station close in September 1956 and the goods yard followed in April 1965. The signal box (opened in 1884 with 18 levers for signals and points) remained in use, however, as a block post to divide up the Westerfield-Woodbridge section and to operate the level crossing gates. The box lasted until 1984, when it was closed as a result of the introduction of RETB (Radio Electronic Token Block) signalling on the East Suffolk line; at the same time, the manual level crossing gates were replaced by the current automatic half-barriers. The station building is still extant today, and is occupied by the Mallard Business Centre.

Staten Island Museum (officially the Staten Island Institute of Arts & Sciences) is Staten Island’s oldest cultural institution, and the only remaining general interest museum in New York City. 
Founded in 1881 by fourteen of New York City’s first “environmental activists”, the Staten Island Museum houses artifacts and specimens from ancient to contemporary periods. This “mini-Smithsonian” is rich with arts, natural sciences and local history.
The museum’s holdings are formally organized into three main collections: Natural Sciences, Fine Art and History Archives & Library. The natural science collections encompass over 500,000 botanical, biological, anthropological and mineral specimens including bird nests and eggs, mounted animals, fossils, shells, and a significant collection of insects, including important type of specimens. Based upon a 19th-century model, the art collection includes works spanning prehistory to the modern period, with representations of diverse world cultures from both the Western and Non-Western traditions. The historical collections include a library, maps and atlases, early films, audio recordings, photographs, historical objects, ephemera and archival documents reaching back to the 17th century.
History.
The Staten Island Museum was founded in 1881 as a private society of local naturalists and antiquarians who pooled their personal collections to create the public museum in 1908. William T. Davis, along with Nathaniel Lord Britton, Arthur Hollick, Charles W. Leng, are some of the founding fathers who also contributed significantly to the city’s nature preserve, research and education. The museum focused on environmental protection and has participated in the preservation of High Rock Park and the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. Since 1908, the staff has conducted annual bird counts together with the Audubon Society. In 1909, the Section of Art was organized, and in 1919 the Staten Island Institute of Arts & Sciences was incorporated to reflect the broader mission which also includes local history. 
The museum has been called a "Mini Smithsonian" because of the breadth of its collections, and is based on a 19th-century model of creating within one's own community the complete resources for a cultural education. As a general interest museum, it is one of the last intact examples of the first type of public museum in America, and today serves a diverse audience of 80,000 people annually, with the goal of providing cross-disciplinary exhibitions for a wide cross-section of visitors. 
As the oldest cultural organization on Staten Island, the museum has been instrumental in the founding of many other cultural organizations in the area. These include the New York Botanical Garden (the institute's co-founder Nathaniel Lord Britton became its first director), the Staten Island Zoo (originally the Staten Island Zoological Society, a Section of the Museum in 1933), the Staten Island Historical Society (running Historic Richmond Town), and the Staten Island Children's Museum. The museum also greatly impacted Staten Island's environment, contributing to the preservation of the Greenbelt and establishment of other environmental organizations.
Current mission.
It is the mission of the Staten Island Museum to document, research, preserve, collect, interpret and exhibit significant objects and themes in the areas of natural science, art and local history, with the goal of educating, celebrating and enriching the community of Staten Island in particular, and the New York metropolitan region in general.
Collections.
Art.
The Museum’s art collection ranges from ancient Egyptian sculpture, to Renaissance paintings, to 19th century Hudson River School landscapes of Staten Island and New York Harbor, to 21st century abstract art, photography and new media. It is the only museum actively collecting works by contemporary Staten Island artists. Its collections include American landscape paintings, Old Master prints, historic costume pieces and costume accessories, African sculpture and masks, Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, Japanese prints, Pre-Columbian ceramics, ancient and modern Native American artifacts, English and American silver, and both Western and Non-Western objects of vertu, for example collections of Chinese snuff bottles, carved smoking pipes, and pocket watches, the bequests of local benefactor-collectors. It has a group of Samuel H. Kress Italian Renaissance paintings, and several complementary small 19th century Renaissance-revival bronzes. There are important 19th-20th-century paintings featuring Staten Island and New York Harbor, fine 19th and 20th century portraits, and works by prominent local contemporary artists. Examples of traditional representational art in the Staten Island Museum’s permanent collection include prints by Rembrandt, Goya, Piranesi and Audubon, paintings by Cropsey, Moran, Alma-Tadema, Giovanni di Paolo and Pordenone, sculpture by Hiram Powers and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. There are Japanese prints by Hiroshige, Hokusai, Utamaro and Kunisada. The Modern Art collection includes works by John Sloane, Guy Pene du Bois, George Bellows, Chagall, Leger, Maillol, Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, Isabel Bishop, Peter Max, Donald Judd and the folk artist Clementine Hunter. Over 150 women artists are represented in the Staten Island Museum’s holdings.
History.
The museum has over half a million items in the local History Collection, including authentic land grants with the wax seals of King Charles II (1674) and King William III (1696) as well as a 1776 military document signed by William Howe, Commander in Chief of the British Armies.
Natural Science.
The Museum houses a 130-year comprehensive record of the changing biodiversity of the New York metro area, fully documented with specimens, including specimens of birds and mammals, a collection of fish, amphibians and reptiles preserved in alcohol, 500,000 mounted insects, and 25,000 plants preserved in the herbarium.
Current Exhibitions.
Beauty Rediscovered: Paintings by Adeline Albright Wigand & Otto Charles.
The Wigands studied with important artists of the 19th – early 20th century in New York and Paris, and brought the fruits of their classical training and education to Staten Island where they lived and worked from 1916 until their deaths in 1944. The exhibition contains nearly 50 works, including 4 from the Staten Island Museum’s permanent collection. The remaining pieces are made available courtesy of private collectors, many of which are Wigand family members.
Cicada Collection.
A display of the largest cicada collection (approx. 35,000 specimens) in North America, which includes numerous type specimens of species originally described by William T. Davis.
The Wall of Insects.
A display of over 150 beetles, cicadas, butterflies and moths from the permanent collection.
Hall of Natural Sciences.
Highlights from the museum’s natural sciences collection, displayed in a manner reminiscent of a late 19th-century museum, including mounted birds and mammals, bird’s eggs and nests, rocks, minerals and fossils, seashells, plants, insects, a Victorian shadowbox, and a fluorescent mineral room.
Geology Collection.
A display of a wide-ranging Staten Island geology collection, including type specimens of plant fossils first discovered on Staten Island.
The Lenape: The first Staten Islanders.
The most comprehensive Lenape exhibit in the New York City metropolitan area, drawn from over 10,000 objects found on Staten Island and dating from 10,000 B.C. to the 17th century.
Staten Island Ferry Exhibition - the only Staten Island Ferry exhibition in the nation.
The exhibit pays homage to the history of the Staten Island Ferry through photographs, artwork, ship models and artifacts from ferries' past, now including the over 50-year-old statuesque U.S. Navy Mark V Diving Suit who is affectionately referred to as the Diverman.
Expansion.
Operations at Snug Harbor.
In addition to its original building located just two blocks from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, Staten Island’s "hometown" museum is operating its Art Conservation Studio and the Staten Island History Center & Archives at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, an campus of landmark Greek Revival buildings, joining other cultural institutions at the site. The museum is transforming from the 19th century model of a museum as a "cabinet of curiosities", into a fully realized 21st century institution that is accessible, diverse, technologically advanced, and demonstrates leadership in collections management, exhibitions, education and public programming.
New museum.
The new museum, on the Snug Harbor Campus, is the first federal historic landmark on Staten Island designed to achieve LEED Gold certification, including geo-thermal heating. The mainly city-funded ($23 million) renovation of Building A (Art) will be completed in 2013, adding over , with additional space to follow in Building B (Bio-Diversity) three to four years later. 
The new museum will open with the anticipated blockbuster 'The Island Scene/Seen', an interpretation of Staten Island across three centuries, including commissioned works by contemporary artists and featuring Hudson River School landscape paintings by Jasper Cropsey and Edward Moran from the museum's collection. 
In addition, a life size replica of a mastodon skeleton will greet visitors as they enter the new museum, a creature that once roamed the hills of Staten Island as evidenced by local discoveries held in the museum's fossil collection on display in the new lobby.

Davis served on President Ronald Reagan's White House staff from 1985 until March 1987 as a Principal Associate Director in the Office of Cabinet Affairs and Special Assistant to the President. As the Associate Director, his responsibilities included the coordination and development of US domestic policy in the White House. He oversaw all policy planning and decision-making for issues related to Environment and Energy.
During his tenure at the White House, Davis served as Principle Director of the Domestic Policy Council, in the Office of the Cabinet Secretary. As such he coordinated policies and projects, which included the President's Catastrophic Illness Bill, the Omnibus Health Bill of 1986, the Privatization of Conrail, the President's Space Commercialization Policy, the Rogers Commission, and the President’s Competitiveness Package of 1987. Davis was also a member of a number of the interagency working groups including the Special Interagency Working Group on Space, the Health Policy Working Group and the Working Group on Environment.
In addition to his service in the White House, Davis held appointments in; The Department of Health and Human Services, The Commerce Department, International Trade Administration, The Department of Interior and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Domestic Political Experience.
1976 Chairman, Alabama College Republicans.
1979 Staff member, Republican National Committee.
1980 Regional Director, Commitment ’80 Reagan/Bush Campaign.
1982 Campaign Manager, Paul Trible’s successful US Senate campaign.

International Political Experience.
In addition to political campaigns in the United States, Davis has extensive experience as an international political consultant in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through his firm, Davis Manafort Inc., he has coordinated Presidential, Parliamentary, Gubernatorial and Referendum campaigns in over a dozen countries. His activities also include developing and implementing democracy building campaigns in foreign countries.
2000 Presidential campaign.
Davis served as Manafort's deputy in orchestrating the 1996 Republican National Convention; both would later join Bob Dole's presidential team. While working for Dole, Davis told a reporter that he was "blown away" by McCain's unconventional politics. He joined McCain's first election bid in 1999, as campaign manager.
Homeownership Alliance.
In 2000, Davis became the head of a group called the Homeownership Alliance, a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac advocacy group. Its website said that the organization was dedicated to "exposing and defeating trends that would harm consumer access to the lowest-cost mortgage option." He was head of the group for five years, being paid more than $30,000 per month. At the end of 2005, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decided that Homeownership Alliance had outlived its usefulness, and it was closed.
Reform Institute.
When McCain started the Reform Institute in 2001 to promote campaign finance reform, he involved Davis. In 2002, Davis was paid $120,000 as an institute consultant; in 2003, he was paid $110,000 in fees. In 2004 and 2005, when he was president of the non-profit institute, his salary totaled $165,000. Tax forms said he worked five hours a week or "as needed."
2008 Presidential campaign.
Role.
In 2006, Davis helped plan McCain's next White House run, envisioning a corporate-style campaign modeled after President Bush's 2004 bid. He began McCain's 2008 presidential election campaign as the chief executive. In July 2007, with the resignations of campaign manager Terry Nelson and chief strategist John Weaver, he took the position of Campaign Manager. In July 2008, Steve Schmidt was brought in to take charge of day to day campaign activities, although Davis retained the title of campaign manager.
Payments.
In 2006, Davis and Manafort formed the company 3eDC, an Internet firm, which the McCain campaign selected to oversee the campaign's Web site and online fund raising. The company was paid $340,000 before the contract's cancellation in April 2007; in mid-June, the campaign reported that it still owed the company $721,000. In all, the McCain campaign paid $971,860 to the company. In June 2008, Campaign Money Watch, a 527 independent political group, filed a federal complaint that the company had improperly reduced the amount the campaign owed it by $107,000.
This complaint was found to have no cause and dismissed by the FEC in June 2009.
In April 2008, after McCain became the presumptive Republican nominee, 3eDC was paid $20,000 by the Republican National Committee (RNC). In June 2008, the RNC and 3eDC were negotiating a larger contract that could be worth $2 million or $3 million. FEC expenditure reports for the RNC and the McCain campaign show that this never materialized.
Controversies.
Payments from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
On September 21, 2008, the "New York Times" reported that during the period from 2000 to 2002 (while Franklin Raines was the CEO of Fannie Mae), Davis received nearly $2 million from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for consulting services. According to Robert McCarson, a former spokesman for Fannie Mae, "the value that he Davis brought to the relationship was the closeness to Senator McCain and the possibility that Senator McCain was going to run for president again." McCarson also claims that "while he worked Fannie Mae from 2000 to 2002, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together paid Mr. Davis's firm $35,000 a month.".
Three days later, the "New York Times" reported that Rick Davis' firm, Davis Manafort, had been paid $15,000 per month by Freddie Mac, for "consulting", from the end of 2005, when Davis stopped being head of the Homeownership Alliance, until August 2008. Payments stopped when Freddie Mac was taken over by the federal government. The "Times" said that "Davis took a leave from Davis Manafort for the presidential campaign, but as an equity holder continues to benefit from its income."
The McCain campaign responded on September 24 with a statement that Davis had separated from Davis Manafort in 2006, and that "As has been previously reported, Mr. Davis has seen no income from Davis Manafort since 2006. Zero. Mr. Davis has received no salary or compensation since 2006. Mr. Davis has received no profit or partner distributions from that firm on any basis -- weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual -- since 2006. Again, zero. Neither has Mr. Davis received any equity in the firm based on profits derived since his financial separation from Davis Manafort in 2006." On September 28, "Newsweek" reported that Davis had joined the campaign in January 2007, not in 2006, and that he specified that his $20,000-a-month salary be paid directly to Davis Manafort.
The "Times" reported that "No one at Davis Manafort other than Mr. Davis was involved in efforts on Freddie Mac’s behalf, the people familiar with the arrangement said." "Newsweek" reported that during the period of the payments, Freddie Mac had no contact with Davis Manafort other than receiving monthly invoices from the firm and paying them. The only thing that Freddie Mac officials could recall Davis doing for the company, the "Times" said, was speaking at an October 2006 forum attended by midlevel and senior executives who contributed to Freddie PAC, the company’s political action committee.
Involvement with Oleg Deripaska.
In 2006, Davis helped set up the encounter between McCain and Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska in Sweden during an international economic conference. Deripaska's suspected links to anti-democratic and organized crime figures are so controversial that the U.S. government revoked his entry visa in 2006.
At the time, Davis was working for a lobbying firm and seeking to do business with the billionaire. Later that month, Deripaska wrote to Davis and his partner, political consultant Paul J. Manafort, to thank them for arranging the meeting. "Thank you so much for setting up everything in Kloster so spectacularly," he wrote. "It was very interesting to meet Senators McCain, Chambliss and Sununu in such an intimate setting."
DHL.
In 2003, Davis and his lobbying firm were hired by German logistic company DHL and Airborne Express, to lobby Congress to approve a merger between the two firms. DHL Holdings was eventually successful in acquiring Airborne Express.
McCain and Davis have come under attack by the AFL-CIO for facilitating the deal, as DHL is now planning to quit using the Wilmington, Ohio freight airport as a hub. The airport and package-sorting facility in Wilmington was previously owned by Airborne Express. The move by DHL would cost an estimated 8,000 jobs at the Wilmington air park. At the time of the merger, the deal created an estimated 1,000 jobs for the Wilmington area.
Fictional portrayals.
Davis was portrayed by Peter MacNicol in the 2012 HBO film "Game Change".

Scofield Reservoir

Scofield Reservoir is a reservoir in Carbon County, Utah, United States. Located on the Price River, a tributary of the Green River, Scofield Reservoir is adjacent to northernmost boundary of the Manti-La Sal National Forest. The reservoir sits at an elevation of , on the northern edge of the Wasatch Plateau. Utah State Route 96 runs along the western shoreline.
After initial attempts to complete a permanent dam on the Price River, the Scofield Project was initiated by the US Bureau of Reclamation. The Scofield Project eventually irrigated area lands originally to be served by Mammoth Dam, and later by the defunct Gooseberry Project. The present day dam was completed in 1946. Besides providing flood protection due to variable stream flow, the reservoir is an important source of water for municipal and industrial sources. It is also a popular fishing and outdoor recreation spot for nearby communities.
Hydrology.
The reservoir is situated on the Price River. The reservoir is also fed by ground water and many small intermittent mountain streams during spring runoff. Principal among these are Fish Creek (Utah) and Clear Creek Canyon (Utah) Annual inflow is .
History.
Irrigation development of lands served by the Scofield Project began in 1883. Ditch companies were organized, and the water was diverted from the natural flow of the Price River. From time to time, canal systems were combined and extended until it was found that natural flow of the river was inadequate to supply irrigation demands fully.
The Mammoth Reservoir Company was incorporated and made filings on the floodwaters of the Price River in 1896. In 1900, a group of farmers from Sanpete County secured the rights of the company for storing water and conveying it by transmountain diversion to their lands.
During 1902, the Sanpete group had financial difficulties and the project passed into the hands of the Irrigated Lands Co. The latter company abandoned the idea of watering Sanpete County lands and made plans to irrigate near Price, Utah. The company, in cooperation with the State of Utah, proceeded with construction of Mammoth Dam. After going through considerable financial difficulty, the Irrigated Lands Co. was reorganized in 1911 to form the Price River Irrigation Co., which developed the project as rapidly as financial conditions and demand for water would permit. The dam failed June 25, 1917, when it was only partly completed, releasing of water and causing flood damage estimated at $1 million to railroad and mining property. 
The Price River Water Conservation District, a municipal corporation, was organized in 1921 for developing storage facilities in the Price River watershed to replace the destroyed Mammoth Dam. Under the district's direction, Scofield Dam was constructed during 1925-1926. The reservoir formed behind the dam had a capacity of . In May 1928, with the reservoir practically filled for the first time, the dam partially failed.
Emergency repairs, together with rapid evacuation of storage water through the outlet tunnel, were effective in preventing complete failure and a devastating flood. Numerous attempts at placing the dam in a safe operating condition were unsuccessful. In view of the apparent weakness of the dam, storage in Scofield Reservoir was strictly limited to a maximum of .
The replacement of the original dam was expedited during World War II because a potential failure of the existing dam posed a threat to the war effort. The Bureau of Reclamation investigated the development of the Scofield Project in accordance with a cooperative contract between the United States and the State of Utah. The study resulted in the adoption of the plan to replace the unsafe Scofield Dam with a completely new and larger structure to be erected about downstream from the existing dam.
The project was authorized by the president on June 24, 1943, under the terms of the Water Conservation and Utilization Act of August 11, 1939 (53 Stat. 1418), as amended. 
Under the Utah Water Conservancy Act of 1941, the Carbon Water Conservancy District was organized in 1943 for the purpose of negotiating a contract with the United States for construction of the new dam. Contract negotiations between this district, the Price River Water Conservation District, and the United States were completed in 1943.
Construction of the new storage works by the W.W. Clyde Company of Springville, Utah was undertaken during World War II to prevent possible flood damage to the main line of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the State highway, the telephone and telegraph lines, and the coal mines, all of which were important to the war effort. The new dam was completed June 15, 1946.
Current dam.
Scofield Dam is a zoned earthfill structure with a structural height of . The dam's crest length is with a top width of thirty feet. It contains 204,000 cubic yards of material. The maximum base width is . Total capacity of Scofield Reservoir is with an active capacity of . The spillway is an uncontrolled concrete crest and concrete lined chute at the right abutment.
Uses.
Uses of Scofield Reservoir and its watershed include coal mining, agriculture, residential, fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, camping, and a variety of other types of summer and winter recreations. 
Initially, the Federal government viewed the dam as a flood control measure to prevent damage to vital defense industries and transportation. For the local population, Scofield Dam and Reservoir also supplied irrigation water for surrounding farms. In 1943, local farms grew alfalfa, barley, beans, corn, oats, wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, and pasture. Orchard crops around Helper included peaches, pears, apricots, and apples.
Crop values on the Scofield Project reached over one million dollars in the 1960s and early 1970s. From 1973 to 1974, crop values jumped from $1,552,089 to $3,672,419. Drought of 1977, caused the value plunged to $1,515,005. Gross crop value reached four million dollars in 1981.
While still providing flood protection and sustainable water supply, the reservoir now serves as a popular recreation area. It is part of Scofield State Park, part of the Utah State Parks system.
Scofield has traditionally been one of Utah's top fisheries. Besides producing desirable sizes and quantities of trout, it is unique in that it is an outstanding shore fishery. The reservoir is home to rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, redside shiner, mountain sucker. Common invertebrate species include damselfly, mayfly, and crayfish. It is also popular during the winter as an ice fishery. In recent years the fishery and its management have been impacted due to water quality impairments.
The reservoir is also home to the Scofield Triathlon, held annually since 2006.
Communities.
To the direct south of the reservoir is the town of Scofield, Utah. Approximately northwest, lies the Provo-Orem metropolitan area.

Standel

The Standel Company is an American company specialized in the manufacture of electric guitar amplifiers. It was founded in 1953 by Robert "Bob" Crooks in Temple City, California. Standel (a portmanteau of the words standard stand and electronics el) was the name of Crook's side-business of radio and hi-fi repair, located in his garage at 10661 Freer Street, Temple City, California.
History.
Origins.
In 1952, Bob Crooks was approached by inventor/musician Paul Bigsby, who advanced the engineer 75 dollars to build him a custom amplifier to go with the then famous Bigsby solid bodied electric guitars and pedal steel guitars. It was to be the first ever made under the Standel brand. 
When designing the amplifier, Crooks would play Les Paul's recording of the song, Lover, several times through the amplifier and tweak it until it sounded "right". However, the final result was inappropriate for amplifying a musical instrument. Paul Bigsby played through the amp with one of his steel guitars and it "sounded terrible". Crooks noted the difference between building a guitar amplifier and building a standard hi-fi amplifier. As a result, Bigsby loaned Crooks a guitar so he could continue improving the amplifier.
Founding.
For a time, Bigsby lost interest in the project, but Crooks nevertheless continued working on his design for several months. He eventually came up with one he was satisfied with. Its cabinet featured padded Naugahyde, aluminum guards around the cabinet, a lighted control panel, JBL D-130 speaker and independent bass and treble controls. Crooks amplifier was both visually and sonorously appealing. He used his shop's name "Standel" as the amplifier's brand. The model was dubbed the 25L15 because it had 25 watts of power and a Lansing, 15" speaker. Bigsby eventually purchased a Standel 25L15, #1018 on April, 10th, 1954.
Ascent to popularity.
Once satisfied with his design, Crooks started attending local concerts in order to spread the word about his amplifiers and get musicians to test them. The first one of these musicians was the late "Speedy" West. West, a steel guitarist, was asked by Crooks, while at Cliffie Stone's "Hometown Jamboree" show, to try out his guitar amp. He liked it and ordered the very first Standel amplifier that same night.
Bob then took his amp to the Town Hall Party dance in Compton, California, where Merle Travis and Joe Maphis would be playing. They ordered the second and fourth Standel amplifiers.
Standel amplifiers would benefit from a relative rise in popularity among professional musicians, although at a small scale. Only 64 amplifiers appear on "The Butcher List" (Bob's handwritten chart of amplifiers and clients). Due to the high cost of building these amplifiers, (the JBL alone was $90, about 2–3 months rent in those days) they were used mostly by session musicians, as their high prices made them difficult to attain for an amateur or hobbyist (price being about double that of a standard production amplifier).
By 1963, Standel introduced hybrid amplification and by 1965 developed a full line of all solid-state amplifiers. In order to protect the designs from reverse engineering, Crooks coated the amplifier's modules in color-coded epoxy resin from 1963 to 1969. With the exception of the Red Tremolo module (which usually fails), 95% of these circuits continue to function after 45–50 years of use. For those needing repair, the Standel website (www.standelamps.com) post all known epoxy module schematics to aid technicians in keeping these amplifiers in service.
Downfall.
In 1970, Standel unknowingly received a batch of output transistors that, over time, would fail with a burst of DC taking the speakers with them. The once dependable Standel brand began experiencing a high rate of warranty returns.
Eventually, in 1971, the cost to cover warranty repairs became too high for Standel to endure so CMI (Standel and Gibson distributor) covered the cost, and in doing so, acquired controlling interest in the company. By 1972, the Standel brand was replaced by SG Amplifiers (Standel Gibson) being manufactured in the Standel factory at 4918 Santa Anita Ave., El Monte, California. The SG line was a hybrid design (solid-state preamp, tube power amp), developed by Bob Crooks, which harkened back to the original Standel hybrid designs of 1963.
After just over a year of operation, the SG line of amplifiers was discontinued. and the old factory closed down. 
For the next 25 years, Bob continued design work for various amplifier companies, including BBE, and developed the Sonic Maximizer. This circuit was licensed by numerous companies and is arguably Bob's most successful design.
Reformation of Standel.
In 1997, after 25 years of abandonment, the Standel Trademark became public domain and Bob Crooks was quick to secure the brand. Wanting to produce Standels again, and after a number of remarkable coincidences, Bob came into contact with Danny "Sage" McKinney, the founder of Requisite Audio Engineering and through Franklin Garlock (Standel's west coast sales rep from the 1960s), requested a meeting with McKinney. Danny, having first met Bob when he was only 14 years old, always saw Bob as a mentor and looked forward to seeing him again. Shortly after this reuniting, Bob offered Danny the licensing to build and market Standels, with Bob acting as technical advisor to the new Standel Co. For the next 10 years ('97-'07) Standels were built at the Requisite Audio Engineering shop, in Glendale, California, just 17 miles from the original Standel factory.
Over the next two years, Bob's health began to fail and, in 1999, he died at 79 years. Bob lived to see his original design, reintroduced at the 1998 NAMM convention in Anaheim, California, 45 years after its introduction in 1953.
After Bob's death, McKinney continued to operate the Standel Company under the original licensing agreement, granted by Bob's widow, Deloris Crooks. In 2005, McKinney became the sole owner of The Standel Company and The Standel Company trademark.
Present.
In 2007, the company was moved to Ventura, California, where they continue to build, to original specification, the Standel 25L15 and variations of the 50L15 & 100L15 models and Acoustic Magnifier versions of all models. They continue to use original (50 year old) JBL D-130 speakers. Each speaker receiving a specially developed surround edge treatment and full re-magnetization before being put into another 50-years of service, in a Standel amplifier.
Technical achievements.
Standel was a pioneer in modern amplifier design, the following are some of the company's achievements.
Musical instruments.
From 1961 to 1967, Standel had a short period as a manufacturer of stringed instruments. 
and The Harptone Manufacturing Co. designed and built a product line of 10 simi hollow body and arch-top guitars,5 acoustic models in 6 and 12 string variants and 
2 basses. A simi Hollow body and the first production acoustic bass. 
Bill Lynch of Prattville, Alabama is the an owner of one of the Harptone made Standel electric 
basses. Model 400-D, serial number 1023L.

Parathyroid adenoma

A parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. It generally causes hyperparathyroidism; there are very few reports of parathyroid adenomas that were not associated with hyperparathyroidism.
A human being usually has four parathyroid glands located on the back surface of the thyroid in the neck. The parathyroids secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases the concentration of calcium in the blood by inducing the bones to release calcium into the blood and the kidneys to reabsorb it from the urine into the blood. When a parathyroid adenoma causes hyperparathyroidism, more parathyroid hormone is secreted, causing the calcium concentration of the blood to rise, resulting in hypercalcemia.
Signs and symptoms.
The first signs of a parathyroid adenoma and the resulting primary hyperparathyroidism can include bone fractures and urinary calculi such as kidney stones.
Oftentimes Parathyroid adenoma is not diagnosed until found on standard blood-tests that reveal high calcium content in the blood, it can appear in urine tests as well. Patients may not be experiencing any noticeable symptoms but could be producing excessive amounts of calcium and eventually experience problems later in life if untreated. However, patients can experience common symptoms that can range from joint, muscle, and abdominal pain to slight discomfort. Additionally patients might be experiencing feelings of depression due to the hormonal imbalance. Constipation and exhaustion can also be experienced as a result of the irregularity in the bloodstream. There is also a potential that the kidneys could be damaged with the excess of calcium in the blood.
Diagnosis.
Hyperparathyroidism is confirmed by blood tests such as calcium and PTH levels. A specific test for parathyroid adenoma is sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy, the sestamibi scan. This nuclear imaging technique reveals the presence and location of pathological parathyroid tissue.
Treatment.
Surgery is the only cure for parathyroid adenomas. It is successful about 95% of the time. Parathyroidectomy is the removal of the affected gland(s). The standard of treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism was formerly a surgical technique called bilateral neck exploration, in which the neck was opened on both sides, the parathyroids were identified, and the affected tissue was removed. By the 1980s, unilateral exploration became more common. Parathyroidectomy can now be performed in a minimally invasive fashion, mainly because imaging techniques can pinpoint the location of the tissue. Minimally invasive techniques include smaller open procedures, radio-guided and video-assisted procedures, and totally endoscopic surgery.
Before surgery is attempted, the affected glandular tissue must be located. Though the parathyroid glands are usually located on the back of the thyroid, their position is variable. Some people have one or more parathyroid glands elsewhere in the neck anatomy or in the chest. About 10% of parathyroid adenomas are ectopic, located not along the back of the thyroid but elsewhere in the body, sometimes in the mediastinum of the chest. This can make them difficult to locate, so various imaging techniques are used, such as the sestamibi scan, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ultrasound, MRI, and CT scans.
Genetics.
Parathyroid adenoma can be associated with overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene.

<doc id="18521026" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18521026" title="North American Monsoon">
North American Monsoon

The North American monsoon, variously known as the Southwest United States monsoon, the Mexican monsoon, or the Arizona monsoon, is experienced as a pronounced increase in rainfall from an extremely dry June to a rainy July over large areas of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. These summer rains typically last until mid-September when a drier regime is reestablished over the region. Geographically, the NA monsoon precipitation region is centered over the Sierra Madre Occidental in the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Durango, Sonora and Chihuahua.
Causes and effects.
The North American Monsoon is not as strong or persistent as its Indian counterpart, mainly because the Mexican Plateau is not as high or as large as the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. However, the North American Monsoon shares most of the basic characteristics of its Indian counterpart. There is a shift in wind patterns in summer which occurs as Mexico and the southwest U.S. warm under intense solar heating. As this happens, the flow reverses. The prevailing winds start to flow from moist ocean areas into dry land areas.
The North American monsoon is associated with an area of high pressure called the subtropical ridge that moves northward during the summer months and a thermal low (a trough of low pressure which develops from intense surface heating) over the Mexican Plateau and the Desert Southwest of the United States. The monsoon begins in late May to early June in southern Mexico and quickly spreads along the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental, reaching Arizona and New Mexico in early July. The monsoon extends into the southwest United States as it matures in mid-July, when an area of high pressure, called the monsoon or subtropical ridge, develops in the upper atmosphere over the Four Corners region, creating wind flow aloft from the East or South-East. 
Pulses of low level moisture are transported primarily from the Gulf of California and eastern Pacific. The Gulf of California, a narrow body of water surrounded by mountains, is particularly important for low-level moisture transport into Arizona and Sonora. Upper level moisture is also transported into the region, mainly from the Gulf of Mexico by easterly winds aloft. Once the forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental green up from the initial monsoon rains, evaporation and plant transpiration can add additional moisture to the atmosphere which will then flow into Arizona. Finally, if the southern Plains of the U.S. are unusually wet and green during the early summer months, that area can also serve as a moisture source.
As precipitable water values rise in early summer, brief but often torrential thunderstorms can occur, especially over mountainous terrain. This activity is occasionally enhanced by the passage of tropical waves and the entrainment of the remnants of tropical cyclones.
Monsoons play a vital role in managing wildfire threat by providing moisture at higher elevations and feeding desert streams. Heavy monsoon rain can lead to excess winter plant growth, in turn a summer wildfire risk. A lack of monsoon rain can hamper summer seeding, reducing excess winter plant growth but worsening drought. 
Flash flooding is a serious danger during the monsoon season. Dry washes can become raging rivers in an instant, even when no storms are visible as a storm can cause a flash flood tens of miles away (never camp in a dry wash in the desert). Lightning strikes are also a significant danger. Because it is dangerous to be caught in the open when these storms suddenly appear, many golf courses in Arizona have thunderstorm warning systems.
Patterns of rainfall.
Rainfall during the monsoon is not continuous. It varies considerably, depending on a variety of factors. There are usually distinct "burst" periods of heavy rain during the monsoon, and "break" periods with little or no rain. Monsoon precipitation, however, accounts for a substantial portion of annual precipitation in northwest Mexico and the Southwest U.S. Most of these areas receive over half their annual precipitation from the monsoon.
The North American Monsoon circulation pattern typically develops in late May or early June over southwest Mexico. By mid to late summer, thunderstorms increase over the "core" region of the southwest U.S. and northwest Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexican states of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Durango. The monsoon typically arrives in mid to late June over northwest Mexico, and early July over the southwest U.S. Once the monsoon is underway, mountain ranges, including the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Mogollon Rim provide a focusing mechanism for the daily development of thunderstorms. Thus much of the monsoon rainfall occurs in mountainous terrain. For example, monsoon rainfall in the Sierra Madre Occidental typically ranges from 10 to 15 inches. Since the southwest U.S. is at the northern fringe of the monsoon, precipitation is less and tends to be more variable. Areas further west of the core monsoon region, namely California and Baja California, typically receive only spotty monsoon-related rainfall. In those areas, the intense solar heating isn't strong enough to overcome a continual supply of cold water from the North Pacific Ocean moving down the west coast of North America. Winds do turn toward the land in these areas, but the cool moist air actually stabilizes the atmosphere. The monsoon pushes as far west as the Peninsular Ranges and Transverse Ranges of southern California, but rarely reaches the coastal strip. As shown in the panorama below, a wall of thunderstorms, only a half-hour's drive away, is a common sight from the sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon.
This monsoon ridge is almost as strong as the one which develops over Asia during the summer. However, since the lower level moisture flow is not as persistent as in the Indian monsoon, the upper level steering pattern and disturbances around the ridge are critical for influencing where thunderstorms develop on any given day. The exact strength and position of the subtropical ridge also governs how far north the tropical easterly winds aloft can spread. If the ridge is too close to a particular area, the sinking air at its center suppresses thunderstorms and can result in a significant monsoon "break." If the ridge is too far away or too weak, the east winds around the high are inadequate to bring tropical moisture into the mountains of Mexico and southwest U.S. However, if the ridge sets up in a few key locations, widespread and potentially severe thunderstorms can develop.
Variability.
Unlike the Pacific region of the United States and the west coast of Baja California, precipitation in the NA monsoon is not associated with large-scale mid-latitude cyclones, but with thunderstorms which have very different spatial/temporal distribution characteristics. The difficulty in understanding the variability of summertime convective activity in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico results from the complex interactions between atmospheric circulation features at both the synoptic (100 to 1000 km spatially, 1 day to 1 week, temporally) and mesoscale (several km to 100 km, hours to one day temporally) and the extremely varied topography. The larger-scale atmospheric motions may control the distribution of water vapor and the general stability or instability (that is, the tendency to form storms) in the atmosphere; nevertheless, local topographic effects are critical to the geographic and even temporal distribution of convective activity.

Military ranks of the Swedish Armed Forces

Military ranks of the Swedish Armed Forces shows the rank system used in the Swedish Armed Forces today, as well as changes during the 20th century due to changes in the personnel structure.
Relative Rank and Grade.
Relative rank and grade as used in the Swedish Armed Forces are shown below.
Distribution of personnel vs ranks.
Since the end of the Cold War, Sweden has gradually abolished the mass-moblization system based on national service and universal military training of all young males, through a system of selective draft of an increasingly lower proportion of available manpower, to a system based on volunteer enlistment. Concomitant a large reduction of forces and capabilities have occurred, as well as a substantial increase of participation in "hot" international operations. Reflecting these new conditions a new personnel structure was introduces in 2009 (see historical section below), emphasizing junior leadership and specialist competence through the recreation of a NCO Corps. As a result, there is a large surplus of older soldiers of officer rank that either will have to be phased out through early retirement or converted into non-commissioned officers.
Ranks and Insignias.
The table below shows ranks according to seniority, with the most senior to the right. OF denotes officers, OR other ranks (as per STANAG 2116). Those ranks were ratified by the supreme commander on October 24, 2008 and became effective as of January 1, 2009. Military ranks of (primarily) Great Britain have been used as a basis for harmonization with NATO.
Translation to English.
This table shows the official translations of the Swedish ranks and their abbreviations.
Historic Ranks.
Ranks before 1972.
Note that the rank of Fältmarskalk (Field Marshal) was a de jure rank before the reform of 1972, even though it has not been used since 1824.
Historical perspective of relative rank and grade.
When an army based on national service (conscription) was introduced in 1901 all commissioned officers had ranks that were senior of the warrant officers ("underofficerare") and non-commissioned officers ("underbefäl"). In a reform 1926 the relative rank of the then senior warrant officer, "fanjunkare", was increased to be equal with the junior officer rank "underlöjtnant" and above the most junior officer rank "fänrik". In 1960 the relative rank of the warrant officers were elevated further so that
i. The lowest warrant officer, "sergeant", had relative rank just below the lowest officer rank, "fänrik".
ii. The second warrant officer rank, "fanjunkare", had relative rank between "fänrik" and "löjtnant"
iii. The highest warrant officer rank, "förvaltare", had relative rank between first lieutenant and captain.
In 1972 the personnel structure changed, reflecting increased responsibilities of warrant and non-commissioned officers, renaming the "underofficerare" as "kompaniofficerare", giving them the same ranks as company grade officers ("fänrik", "löjtnant", "kapten"). "Underbefäl" was renamed "plutonsofficerare" and given the rank titles of "sergeant" and "fanjunkare", although their relative rank were now placed below "fänrik". The commissioned officers were renamed "regementsofficerare", beginning with "löjtnant". The three-track career system was maintained, as well as three separate messes.
A major change in the personnel structure in 1983 (NBO 1983), merged the three professional corps of platoon officers, company officers, and regimental officers into a one-track career system within a single corps called professional officers ("yrkesofficerare"). The three messes were also merged to one. 
In 2008 the Swedish parliament decided to create a two-track career system with a category called "specialistofficerare". When implementing the parliamentary resolution the Chief of Staff decided that some ranks in this category should, like the old "underofficerare" ranks in 1960-1972, have a relative rank higher than the most junior officers. The current relative ranks are shown in the table below. The one mess system is maintained.

Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz

Abraham Niclas (Clewberg) Edelcrantz (28 July 1754, Turku, – 15 March 1821, Stockholm) was a Finnish born Swedish poet and inventor. He was a member of the Swedish Academy, chair 2, from 1786 to 1821.
Edelcrantz was the librarian at The Royal Academy of Turku. In 1783 he moved to Stockholm to lead the Royal Theater and later work as the private secretary of the king Gustaf III. He is known for his experiment with the optical telegraph. He inaugurated his telegraph with a poem dedicated to the Swedish King on his birthday in 1794. The message went from the Palace in Stockholm to the King at Drottningholm.
He eventually developed his own system which was quite different from its French counterpart and almost twice as fast. His system was based on ten collapsible iron shutters. The several positions of the shutters formed combinations of numbers which were translated into letters, words or phrases via codebooks. The telegraph network was made up of telegraph stations positioned at about 10 kilometres from one another.
In 1796 he wrote "A Treatise on Telegraphs".
In 1797, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

1 vs. 100 (Xbox 360 video game)

1 vs. 100 was a massively multiplayer online Xbox Live adaptation of the trivia game show of the same name.
Summary.
There were two versions of the game, referred to as "1 vs. 100 Live" and "1 vs. 100 Extended Play". The Live version was hosted by Chris Cashman in North America and James McCourt in the UK and Ireland, and places a single contestant as "The One" against a group of 100 that make up "The Mob", with the rest of the players making up "The Crowd". The One has the opportunity to win up to 10,000 Microsoft Points, credited to their Xbox Live account, while the remaining members of The Mob divide up the winnings and each win an Xbox Live Arcade game if they are able to eliminate The One. The top three players in The Crowd win the XBLA game as well.
The hosts and players were represented by Xbox Live Avatars. The game was free to all Xbox Live gold subscribers and was supported by advertising revenue. Seasons lasting 13 weeks consisted of various 30-minute extended play sessions followed by live two-hour episodes airing Tuesday and Friday.
Season 2 of "1 vs. 100" began on November 19, 2009 in France, Germany, the United States and Canada, and on November 20, 2009 in the United Kingdom and in the Republic of Ireland. 
On July 15, 2010, Microsoft confirmed that 1 vs. 100 will not return for a third season.
Gameplay.
At the beginning of each 1 vs. 100 Live round, a player is selected as "The One" and 100 players are selected to be "The Mob". Everyone else remains in "The Crowd". Selection is based on weekly, round, and season (lifetime) score.
The game's rules are nearly identical to the game show's: a question is posed, and both The One and The Mob must select an answer from three choices. If The One gets the question wrong, the game is over and the prize money is split up amongst The Mob. If The One gets the answer right, members of The Mob who got the question wrong are eliminated. The payout goes up for every tenth member of The Mob eliminated. The One can opt to quit with their winnings at various intervals, or press their luck and continue on.
The Live version adds the notion of "The Crowd", which allows hundreds of thousands of players to compete alongside The Mob and The One. The top three members of The Crowd win an Xbox Live Arcade game. The Crowd represents one of the three "helps" available to the one, which can be used at any time to lock in their answer. If The One fails to answer the first three questions, the helps are automatically used. The helps are:
The better a member of The Crowd does, the better chance they have of being selected to be a part of The Mob or The One. Selection is based upon statistics for speed, accuracy, and the number of questions answered for that week. A player can only be chosen as The One once per season and as a member of The Mob once per Primetime episode. Each season will give players an opportunity to earn another 200 gamerscore.
Hosts and live features.
The live host is voice actor and comedian Chris Cashman in the US and Canada and James McCourt in the UK and Ireland. The UK and Ireland version, however, does not have a live host for Season 2.
Jen Taylor in the US and Canada and Olivia Lee in the UK and Ireland (both prerecorded) present the questions and count down The Mob as they are eliminated. Statistic breaks occur every few questions when the live host provides color commentary about The One and their performance. Guests are interviewed on the show and have included Major Nelson, Taking Back Sunday, Cliff Bleszinski and Felicia Day. Live telephone calls are placed to participants and broadcast during the breaks as are 30-second advertisements from sponsors.
Extended Play sessions.
The Extended Play version eliminates The One and the crowd and simply has all players compete as a member of The Mob of limitless size. It is typically a 30 minute show with 37 total questions. While there are no prizes during Extended Play, a player's participation contributes to the chance that they will be selected to join The Mob, or be The One during the next Live episode. Players are able to submit questions to be considered for inclusion in the Extended Play mode of the game via a web interface.
A selected theme were aired on a weekly basis, ranging from an hour to hour and a half long. In Season 2, 5 different Featured Episodes were introduced:
1 Family Theme:
2 Fanboy Night:
3 Lifestyle:
4 Entertainment:
5 Sports:
Development.
Manuel Bronstein, director of "1 vs. 100" for Microsoft Studios, describes the game as the realization of Microsoft's "vision for programmatic interactive experiences" delivered via Xbox Live Primetime. The game was due to be released in November 2008 with the "New Xbox Experience" update but it was delayed (as was the rest of the planned Primetime content). While fairly simple in visual appearance, Bronstein explained that the game was in development for more than a year because of technical hurdles, noting that making sure "hundreds of thousands of people see the host and answer the questions at the exact same time and handling prizes and all the things associated with cheating made for an interesting technical challenge."
Bronstein commented that Microsoft met with the producers of the popular television game shows "American Idol" and "Survivor" before partnering with Endemol and choosing "1 vs. 100" "because of its social elements." Joerg Bachmaier, senior VP of digital media for Endemol said "We see Xbox Live version as a replication of the show on another platform... Except now it's more active. Nobody is just sitting back and watching."
Microsoft has stated that the first season of the game would be a "pilot season". Future seasons were dependent upon the success of the show's ability to generate advertiser revenue. Sprint and Honda each paid around $1 million to become primary sponsors of the first season and Microsoft is trying to sell additional one-off or occasional commercial spots.
An open beta was made available to Canadian subscribers with a gold subscription from May 8 through May 24, 2009. The open beta was re-opened and extended to subscribers in the USA on June 1, 2009. Though it was still in beta, on July 10, Microsoft began awarding actual prizes in the North American beta (previously players testing the game simply earned entries into a sweepstakes). They also confirmed that the beta season that commenced June 1 would last 13 weeks. The beta season for both the US and Canada ended on August 31, 2009.
The open beta for the United Kingdom began on July 10, 2009, and both Germany and France began on July 12, 2009.
Based on input from the first season, changes were incorporated into the game for the second season. The player selected as "The One" was found to receive a plethora of messages when they were playing, and thus in the second season, "The One" had their online status set to "Busy", preventing these messages from distracting the player. "The One" also entered the virtual set in a more dramatic fashion.
Reception.
Yahoo Games reported they "found it very hard to put down the controller" in a play test offered to the press and said while it may not necessarily "revolutionise primetime entertainment ... given the right kind of publicity, Microsoft could really have a winner on its hands.". Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of the Penny Arcade gaming webcomic both commended the game for its authentic game-show atmosphere and its natural-feeling extension of social avatar-based gaming, compared with the perceived flaws in Sony's PlayStation Home service.
The game was downloaded over 2.5 million times, and its success has led Microsoft to extend its beta season for two additional weeks. Microsoft claims that the North American version of the game surpassed the Guinness world record for "most contestants in a game show" with over 114,000 simultaneous players.

Hans Maeder

Hans Karl Maeder (December 29, 1909 – September 8, 1988) was an innovative educator who founded the Stockbridge School in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and served as its director and headmaster for 23 years.
Early life and career.
Maeder was born in Hamburg, Germany on December 29, 1909, the third child in a prosperous family. He described his father as an authoritarian nationalist and anti-Semite who embraced Hitler's message. Maeder left home at 18, refusing to go into business as his father had wished, and deciding instead to become a teacher.
Maeder, a socialist, eventually joined the anti-Nazi movement, and fled Germany in 1933 to avoid arrest. He went to Denmark, where he taught at the Udlose Boys Home, an institution for boys with problems. During this time and later travels Maeder wrote for the anti-Nazi underground. But in 1937, Maeder was forced to leave Denmark and subsequently traveled to Kenya, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines. Maeder arrived in Hawaii to teach in 1941, but was interned as an enemy alien on December 8, the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
Maeder was released from an internment camp in Texas on February 23, 1943. Arriving in New York, Maeder soon obtained a position as the director of the boys' division of a YMCA in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In September 1944, Maeder took a teaching job for a year at Windsor Mountain School in Lenox, Massachusetts, several miles from the site of the future Stockbridge School.
Maeder then moved to the Walden School, a private day school in Manhattan, teaching German and the history of languages and briefly serving as the school's director in 1947 and 1948. It was at Walden that he met his wife Ruth, a widow at the time, through her son David, a Walden student whom he later adopted. Maeder left Walden in 1948 to found Stockbridge School.
Stockbridge School.
The Maeders paid $60,000 to acquire the 1,100-plus acres of the former estate of Daniel Rhodes Hanna, son of Mark Hanna. Their purchase of what became the site of Stockbridge School occurred shortly after the failure of Liberal Arts, Inc. to establish a Great Books-based college associated with St. John's College, Annapolis, Maryland, on the same site. The property had been vacant since the Great Depression and extended from the summit of West Stockbridge Mountain to the shore of a lake called the Stockbridge Bowl. Only a portion of this extensive property became the school campus, with the Maeders retaining title to the remainder.
As a progressive private boarding school for adolescents, Maeder intended that Stockbridge School's educational philosophy be interracial, nondenominational and international. The school was notable for being completely racially integrated from its inception and Maeder made successful efforts to recruit an international student body.
To help express Maeder's philosophy, and in light of his experiences as a German refugee and expatriate, the school flew the United Nations flag just below the American flag beginning in 1948, three years after the U.N. came into existence. For some years, its curriculum included a junior year abroad, and Stockbridge briefly operated a branch in Corcelles, Switzerland.
The best-known Stockbridge School alumnus is Arlo Guthrie, whose arrest for littering by Stockbridge police shortly after graduation in 1965 inspired the song "Alice's Restaurant". Alice Brock had been the school librarian before opening a lunch counter in Stockbridge. Among other notable alumni are Chevy Chase, Benjamin Barber, Dr. Kenneth Edelin and Gunter Nabel.
Final years.
Maeder retired from Stockbridge School in 1971. The school closed five years later, in 1976, as a result of declining enrollment and debt. In 1978 the school campus became the site of the DeSisto at Stockbridge School, a wholly unrelated institution.
After leaving Stockbridge, Maeder worked as an educational consultant in New York City. His wife, Ruth, died in 1976. He died in Manhattan in 1988; the cause of his death was prostate cancer.

HP Application Security Center

HP Application Security Center (ASC) was a set of technology solutions by HP Software Division. Much of the portfolio for this solution suite came from HP's acquisition of SPI Dynamics. The software solutions enabled developers, quality assurance (QA) teams and security experts to conduct web application security testing and remediation. The security products have been repackaged as enterprise security products from the HP Enterprise Security Products business in the HP Software Division.
Products.
HP Application Security Center consisted of the following products:
In May 2008, HP Software announced the availability of HP Application Security Center through HP Software as a Service [] along with the announcement of new releases of the HP Application Security Center products.
In September 2009, HP announced that it was discontinuing the HP DevInspect software products, formerly part of HP Application Security Center. HP stated that it had switched its focus to solutions for entire development groups rather than on a tool for individual developers. HP DevInspect was software for individual developers to use in creating secure web applications and services, and it integrated with specific IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). HP DevInspect for .NET operated with Microsoft Visual Studio, and HP DevInspect for Java operated with Eclipse or Rational (IBM) Application Developer. 
Benefits.
HP Application Security Center solutions helped find and fix security vulnerabilities for web applications throughout the application software development lifecycle (SDLC). By catching security vulnerabilities early in the application development lifecycle, organizations could reduce web attacks and vulnerabilities in their web applications. While some security vulnerabilities may exist in the web server or application infrastructure, at least 80 percent of those vulnerabilities existed in the web application itself. 
HP Application Security Center also creates compliance reports for more than 20 laws, regulations and best practices, including PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). PCI DSS is a worldwide information security standard defined by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.

1 vs. 100 (Nintendo DS video game)

1 vs. 100 is the Nintendo DS adaptation of the game show of the same name, in which a single contestant competes against an audience "mob" of 100. The game was released on July 3, 2008.
Gameplay.
The game's rules are identical to the game show's: A question is posed, and both the single contestant and members of the "mob" must guess at the answer. If the contestant gets the question wrong, the game is over and the prize money is split up amongst the mob. If the contestant gets the answer right, members of the mob who got the question wrong are eliminated, and the value of each question goes up for the solo player as the mob thins out. The contestant can opt to quit with their winnings at any time, or press their luck and continue on. Bob Saget, as with the televised show, is the game show host.
Reception.
Critical reception of "1 vs. 100" was generally negative. One universal complaint is the game's small question database, which results in many repeated questions. Reviewers also criticised the game for not giving the player incentives to score well, such as unlockable rewards or score records. IGN noted that "You can opt out to 'take the money' after each round but doing so just leads back to the main menu. The money just disappears: there are no unlocks of any kind or any reason to take the money." Long delays between questions were the cause of further grievances. Non-gameplay elements, such as graphics and sound received a mixed reception.
