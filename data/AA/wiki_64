KhF-1 and KhF-2 bounding gas mines

The KhF-1 and KhF-2 bounding gas mines were Russian Landmines developed during World War II, though they were not deployed during the conflict . Instead of a chemical warhead, the mines when triggered by an operator several hundred meters away, bounded into the air and shattered projecting a chemical gas over an area of between 250 to 300 square meters.

Abraxas sylvata

The Clouded Magpie ("Abraxas sylvata") is a moth of the family Geometridae that was named by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1763.
Description.
This moth is mostly white with brownish patches across all of the wings. There are small areas of pale gray on the forewings and hindwings. They resemble bird droppings while resting on the upper surface of leaves. The adults fly from late May to early August. They are attracted to light. The wingspan is 38 mm. to 48 mm. The moth is nocturnal and is easy to find during the day. They are easy to find resting during the morning. The moth starts being active at early dusk. The moths eat the plants "Betula, Corylus, Fagus, Ulmus, Prunus", and "Frangula". "Abraxas grossulariata" is similar to this species. In a group of specimens of this species, the largest one is 60 mm. while the smallest one is 31 mm. The moth is more common in Eastern Asia than in Europe. The species is listed as a priority species in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan.
Caterpillars.
Caterpillars appear from mid-July to early October. They overwinter as a pupa. The body of the caterpillar is distinctive because it is marked with longitudinal black and yellow stripes. The caterpillars feed on Wych Elm and Common Elm. The pupa hibernates underground. The caterpillars live on several deciduous trees such as "Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra, and Ulmus procera".
Habitat.
The moth was considered rare until the late 1990s in Northern Ireland. The species can be found from Europe to Japan. The moth can be found in forests, thickets, and sometimes parks on various deciduous trees.

Sister Nancy

Sister Nancy, aka Muma Nancy, real name Ophlin Russell-Myers, (born Ophlin Russell on 2 January 1962) is a dancehall DJ and singer. She is known to the world as the first female dancehall DJ and was described as being a "dominating female voice for over two decades" on the dancehall scene. One of her most famous songs is "Bam Bam", labeled as a "well-known reggae anthem" by BBC and a "classic" by "The Observer".
Career.
Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Russell-Myers was one of 15 siblings. Her elder brother, Robert, is better known as Brigadier Jerry, and by her mid-teens, she would occasionally perform on the Twelve Tribes of Israel soundsystem "Jahlovemuzik" sound system that she worked with, and worked for three years on the Stereophonic sound system with General Echo. In 1980, producer Winston Riley was the first to take her into the studio, resulting in her first single, "Papa Dean" for his Techniques label. Russell-Myers went on to perform at "Reggae Sunsplash", making her the first female deejay ever to perform there, and she is also the first female Jamaican deejay to tour internationally. She had further success with singles such as "One Two", "Money Can't Buy Me Love", "Transport Connection" and "Bam Bam". Her debut album, "One Two" was released in 1982. She went on to work with producer Henry "Junjo" Lawes, recording "A No Any Man Can Test Sister Nancy", "Bang Belly", and a collaboration with Yellowman, "Jah Mek Us Fe A Purpose". She continued to appear live, sometimes on "Jahlove Music" with her brother. The sound system toured internationally, with both Sister Nancy and Brigadier Jerry making their debut UK performances at the Brixton Town Hall, London in 1982.
In 1996, she relocated to New Jersey. In an interview with "The Jamaica Observer" in 2002, Russell-Myers said that although she was working in the banking sector, that "music is first love" and said she still performs "every now and then". She explained that her absence from the recording scene was due to her wanting to "give other female artists a chance", though she said she was still "as ready as the first day [she came into the business". "The Observer" cited Russell-Myers a role model for a successive generation of female acts, including Lady Saw, Sister Carol, Mack Diamond, Lady G, Shelly Thunder, Carla Marshall, Lorna G, Lady English, and Lady P. 
In 2007, Russell-Myers released the second of her two albums, "Sister Nancy Meets Fireproof", produced by djMush1, formerly of the Slackers (NYC Ska) on Special Potato Records. The album was distributed by Jammyland Records in New York, NY. The album features four original compositions, as well as four instrumental versions of the aforementioned songs.
Collaborations.
In 2001, Canadian/American producer Krinjah re-mixed "Bam Bam", creating one of the most-sought after 12" singles and arguably kicking off the ragga-jungle revival in North America. In 2004, she collaborated with DJ /rupture and Kid 606 on the "Little More Oil" single, and in 2006, she collaborated with Thievery Corporation on their 2006 compilation "Versions", on the track "Originality". 
In 2006, Canadian producer RCola brought Sister Nancy into Liondub's studio to re-sing her classic "Bam Bam", eventually releasing his Drum and Bass dancefloor remix on 12" vinyl with Division One remix on the AA side. In 2007, Sister Nancy voiced a dubplate of her "Bam Bam" with new lyrics for Atlanta ragga/drum and bass dj Tester.
Compton rapper Guerilla Black sampled "Bam Bam" in his "Compton" song. "Bam Bam" was also featured in Electronic Arts video game "Skate" and in the soundtrack for the movie "Belly".
"Bam Bam" was also sampled by Too Short on his 1993 single "Blowjob Betty".
Personal life.
Russell-Myers is married to her longtime sweetheart of over twenty years. They reside with the rest of her family in New Jersey, where she works as an accountant at a bank. Sister Nancy has one daughter from a previous relationship who is now 20 years old.

William Francis Hillebrand

William Francis Hillebrand (December 12, 1853 – February 7, 1925) was an American chemist.
Biography.
He was the son of the renowned botanist William Hillebrand.
He studied at Cornell University and then in Germany at the University of Heidelberg where he received his Ph.D. in 1875. He then worked with Robert Bunsen for two semesters. His research on metallic cerium, which he together with Thomas Norton obtained first in 1872, started his academic career.
He studied organic chemistry for three semesters with Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig at the University of Strasbourg, but changed to geochemistry and metallurgy by studying at the Freiberg Mining Academy. After returning home to the United States in 1878, he opened an assay office in Leadville, Colorado, in 1879, and then started working as a chemist at the United States Geological Survey in 1880. That year he was sent to Denver to establish a chemical laboratory for the Rocky Mountain Division of the Survey. For five years he remained in charge of this laboratory, and then was transferred to the chief laboratory in Washington. He changed to the National Bureau of Standards in 1909 where he was chief chemist.
He was professor of general chemistry and physics at the National College of Pharmacy, from 1892 to 1910; president of the American Chemical Society in 1906; and in 1908 he became editor of the "Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry". He was the author of several books on chemical subjects.
His son was the professor of English literature Harold Newcomb Hillebrand (1887–1953).
Studies of uranium.
During an analysis of the uranium containing mineral uranite he discovered that a gas evolved. He identified this gas by spectroscopic methods to be nitrogen. Several years later in 1895 William Ramsay did similar experiments with uranium containing minerals and discovered by similar methods that the gas was a mixture of argon and helium which until then had only been detected in the corona of stars.
A reexamination by Ramsay of Hillebrand's samples showed that the gas from uranite contained a large amount of nitrogen.

1954 European Baseball Championship

The 1954 European Championship was the first European Championship. It featured 4 of the 5 members of the new Confederation of European Baseball, as France failed to field a team. The Netherlands, which would dominate the event over the next fifty years, was not part of the organization because they did not think it would be sustainable. The Championship was held on June 26 and June 27 in  Antwerp, Belgium. A messy affair, there was an average of over 10 errors per game due to the low quality of baseball in Europe at that time. Italy took gold, beating Belgium 6-1 and Spain 7-4. Spain won silver despite 8 errors in its loss to Italy. Spain beat Germany by a score of 10-4 in its other contest. Belgium earned bronze, beating Germany 12-5. Germany placed last.

Franklin Odo

Dr. Franklin S. Odo (born 1939) is a Japanese American author, scholar, activist, and historian. Dr. Odo has served as the director of the Asian Pacific American Program at the Smithsonian Institution since the program’s inception in 1997. As the director of the APA Program, Dr. Odo has brought numerous exhibits to the Smithsonian highlighting the experiences of Chinese Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Filipino Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and Indian Americans. He is also the only Asian Pacific American curator at the National Museum of American History.
Background.
Franklin Odo was born in and grew up in Honolulu Hawaii and was the first from Kaimuki High School to attend Princeton University, where he received his B.A. in Asian Studies (China and Japan) in 1961. He then received his M.A. in East Asia regional studies at Harvard University in 1963. He returned to Princeton University, where he completed a doctorate dissertation on Japanese feudalism in 1975. 
While his academic background and training had been in traditional Asian Studies, Dr. Odo became involved in the movement that created Asian American Studies and other ethnic studies in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a result of the anti-war and anti-racism activism in the United States.
Dr. Odo has taught for over 30 years at numerous academic institutions, most recently at the University of Maryland, College Park. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dr. Odo taught at Occidental College; the University of California, Los Angeles; and California State University, Long Beach. In the 1990s, he served as a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Hunter College, Princeton University, and Columbia University. He has also served as the director of ethnic studies at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.
As Director of Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Program.
Since its formation in 1997, the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American (APA) Program has provided vision, leadership, and support for Asian Pacific American activities at the Smithsonian, while also serving as the Smithsonian's liaison to APA communities. Dr. Odo was selected in 1997 to serve as the director of the program, and throughout his tenure, he has brought attention to Asian Pacific American culture and arts to various Smithsonian exhibits. Some of his efforts include a photo exhibit entitled "Through My Father’s Eyes," which featured Filipino American photographer Ricardo Alvarado at the National Museum of American History. In 2003, Dr. Odo co-organized a traveling exhibit of Korean American contemporary artists entitled "Dreams & Reality." He has also led projects to commemorate the centennial of Filipino immigration to the United States, and is the co-curator of “Exit Saigon, Enter Little Saigon,” a project that highlights the growth of the Vietnamese American community after the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. Dr. Odo retired from his director position in January 2010.
Published work.
Along with Amy Tachiki, Eddie Wong, and Buck Wong, Dr. Odo co-edited the first breakthrough Asian American anthology "Roots: An Asian American Reader" (1971).
In 1985, he published "A Pictorial History of the Japanese in Hawai‘i 1885-1924", which opens with the experiences of the first Japanese immigrants to Hawai’i and ends with the 1924 exclusionary laws that effectively denied further Japanese entry into the United States.
In 2003, Dr. Odo authored "No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai’i During World War II", which explores the experiences of a shrinking group of Japanese American men who survived World War II as part of the Varsity Victory Volunteers (VVV).
He is also the editor of the "Columbia Documentary History of the Asian American Experience" (2003), the first book that brought together the canon of various documents pertinent to Asian Pacific American history.
Dr. Odo is currently working on "Hole Hole Bushi", a book on Hawaiian folk/plantation songs.
Awards.
Odo was awarded the President’s Award by the Japanese American Citizens League in July 2008, an award from the Organization of Chinese Americans in August 2008., and the Association for Asian American Studies Lifetime Achievement Award on April 14, 2012

Ware–Hardwick Covered Bridge is a historic bridge on Old Gilbertville Road and Bridge Street in Ware and Hardwick, Massachusetts. It was built in 1886 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The bridge is managed by a joint committee of the two towns.
The wooden structure crosses the Ware River at Bridge Street in the Gilbertville district of Hardwick and Old Gilbertville Road in Ware. Nearly across, it is one of a few 19th century covered bridges that remain in the state. The bridge incorporates a wooden single-web, double-chord lattice truss theme inspired by the 19th-century architect Ithiel Town, a Connecticut native. Unlike other bridges on the Ware River, this bridge survived a major flooding event in 1936.
The state ordered the structure closed in August 2002 after an inspection concluded the bridge could not bear any more weight, due in part to insect infestation. The limit at the time was . Now, there is no weight limit, according to the state Department of Transportation. In October 2010 the bridge reopened upon the completion of a $1.9 million reconstruction and restoration. Wood taken from the bridge was divided between the towns; the Ware Historical Commission planned to use Ware's share of the wood to recreate other historic buildings.

Harvard Shaker Village Historic District

Harvard Shaker Village Historic District is a historic former Shaker community located roughly on Shaker Road, South Shaker Road, and Maple Lane in Harvard, Massachusetts. It was the oldest Shaker settlement in Massachusetts and the second oldest in the United States.
History.
Harvard's Shaker community began with dissenters from the local state-funded church, who left the state church and founded "Square House" in 1769 and in 1781-1782 affiliated themselves with Mother Ann Lee, founder of the Shaker denomination, when she visited the community. The Harvard Shakers "split the community into four “families”, North, East, South and Church (where the elders and elderesses lived)--only the latter two remain today." By the early twentieth century membership had dwindled to a handful from a peak of 200 in the 1850s, so in 1917 the community closed and the buildings were sold. That year preservationist Clara Endicott Sears purchased the 1794 Shaker office building and moved to the nearby Fruitlands Museum, and it is currently the only Harvard Shaker building open to the public. It is the first Shaker museum ever established in the United States. The remaining Shaker buildings are now private residences and much of the surrounding land remains undeveloped through a conservation easement. The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
Music was an important part of Shaker life at Harvard. In the 1780s, several songs were attributed to their spiritual leaders, "Mother Ann's Song" and "Father James's Song." One of the best known early Shaker hymns, "The Humble Heart," came from Harvard, with words by Eunice Wyeth and music by Thomas Hammond.

Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center

The Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center was established in 1997 in order to incorporate the meaningful elements of Asian Pacific American heritages in all aspects of the Smithsonian Institution's work. Through exhibitions, programs, research, and collaboration, the APA Center seeks to improve the public's appreciation of the rols of APAs in the history of the nation and empower APA communities by increasing their sense of inclusion into the national culture. The center has provided leadership, vision, and support for APA activities at the Smithsonian and has also served as the Smithsonian's liaison to APA communities. The center's founding director, Dr. Franklin Odo, retired in January 2010. Dr. Konrad Ng currently serves as director. 
History.
In 1997, the Smithsonian Institution established an advisory group headed by the Honorable Norman Y. Mineta with a mandate to research, deliberate, and then report to Secretary I. Michael Heyman on the Institution's ability to increase and diffuse knowledge about the nation's richly diverse APA communities. 
The Asian Pacific American National Advisory Group's final report, released in June 1998, called for the creation of a program for Asian Pacific American Studies. This central program would provide vision, leadership, and support for all APA activities at the Smithsonian, while serving as a liaison to APA communities. 
The Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center has had significant impact on how the Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum complex, is evolving to better reflect the diversity of our nation of immigrants and indigenous peoples.

Within twenty years of her musical career she earned numerous hits in Poland, including "Zapomniałam", "To był świat w zupełnie starym stylu", "Są takie dni w tygodniu", "Chcę wyjechać na wieś" and "Mam cudownych rodziców". She has won many awards and performed in Poland and abroad. At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s, Sipińska ended her singing career, focusing on architecture and writing.
Biography.
Urszula Sipińska was raised in Wilda, Poznań with elder sister Elżbieta and younger brother Stanisław. She went to music school where she learned to play piano, and later studied Interior Design at University of Fine Arts in Poznań. Although musically active already in her student years, it was not until 1967 that her singing career took off, when she performed "Zapomniałam" at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole. The song, which she had co-written with her sister, became a major hit. In 1968, Sipińska won the 1st prize at the Sopot International Song Festival with the song "Po ten kwiat czerwony". She would subsequently perform at festivals in Switzerland and Tenerife to considerable success.
Sipińska's debut, self-titled album was released in 1971 by Pronit. Her song "Bright Days Will Come" was met with a positive reception at a festival in Mexico, when in Poland she enjoyed success with the song "Jaka jesteś Mario". Both songs were included on her second LP, "Bright Days Will Come", released in 1973, which also included what would become one of her biggest hits, "To był świat w zupełnie starym stylu". The singer continued to perform in Poland and abroad, including East Germany and Japan, before releasing her next album "Zabaw się w mój świat" in 1975. At the festival in Palma, Sipińska was awarded with the 2nd prize for the song "Wołaniem wołam cię".
In 1980, she released her fourth album, "Są takie dni w tygodniu/Kolorowy film", which consisted of two separate suites on both sides of the LP. The song "Są takie dni w tygodniu" became very popular and is now considered one of her biggest hits. This was followed by the country album "W podróży", which was released in 1981 and spawned another hit, "Chcę wyjechać na wieś". In 1982, the singer suffered severe injuries in a car accident in Germany, which almost left her disabled. That prompted her to take a longer break from music.
She returned to recording in 1988 with the song "Mam cudownych rodziców", which would become an evergreen and arguably her biggest hit. It was included on her next album, "Nie zapomniałam...", which was her last album of original material. Accordingly to the decision she had made at the beginning of her career, Urszula Sipińska gave up singing having turned 40. She would only release a holiday album "Białe święta" in 1994, which consisted mostly of Polish Christmas carols. Sipińska focused on architecture and have worked on many high profile projects. She also published feuilletons in magazines and released two books, "Hodowcy lalek" (2005) and "Gdybym była aniołem. Historie prawdziwe, dziwne, śmieszne" (2010).

Battle of Fredericia

The Battle of Fredericia was fought between soldiers of Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark on 6 July 1849 at Fredericia in Denmark. The battle was a part of the First Schleswig War, which was a conflict between Schleswig-Holstein, supported by several German states, and Denmark. Denmark won the battle.
Background.
In 1849, Danish southern Jutland was invaded by 61 000 Schleswig-Holsteinian and German troops, and Danish troops located there withdrew to northern Jutland. As they withdrew, Denmark left 7 000 men to garrison their fortified town of Fredericia, along with a reserve on the island of Funen. Prittwitz, a Prussian commander, ordered the Schleswig-Holsteinian army to besige the town and the siege began on 9 May under the commander of General Eduard von Bonin, whilst the Danish garrison was led by Colonel Lunding.
Prelude.
The Schleswig-Holsteins constructed 4 redoubts, which would bombard the town and cover them from a Danish sally. Trying to prevent the construction of the third redoubt, the garrison sallied on 13 May but the third redoubt was completed by 15 May. From 16 to 20 May, Fredericia was shelled. Most of the population was moved to Funen, and four of the most densely built areas of the town were destroyed by fire. Unable to see into the town, and judging by the fact that the fires were put out quickly, Bonin believed that the damage was not significant.
The Schleswig-Holsteins had not completely cut off the town, and the garrison was able to be relieved several times by troops based in Funen, so Bonin decided to cut off access between the two Danish areas. As a result, he ordered two more redoubts to be constructed, of which one was completed, near the beach between Funen and Fredericia. On 30 May, Danish troops launched another sally, damaging what had been constructed so far, and spiking 9 cannons. The Schleswig-Holsteins were not able to completely cut off the town, but the threat that that could still happen prompted Lunding to urge his superiors to launch an attack soon.
Danish commanders agreed that a major attack would be made north of the town, with General Olaf Rye's 5th Brigade tasked with taking the strongest redoubt, the Treldeskansen; whilst diversionary landings by two fleets each of 22 ships (each had 1 steamer, 4 gunboats, 5 transports and 12 sailing ships) would be launched north and south of Fredericia to draw away enemy troops. The battle was ordered to begin on 5 July but a delay in one of the brigades receiving their orders led to the battle being postponed until the next day. The Schleswig-Holsteins had expected an attack to occur on 5 July, and its army had been waiting in earthworks all of that day. As the Danish troops deployed for the attack in the first hour of 6 July, the Schleswig-Holsteinian troops were sleeping in their camps. A dense fog shrouded the Danish soldiers as they moved, and straw placed over the streets and the noise of the wind reduced the sound they were making as they traversed through Fredericia, resulting in their deployment not being detected.
Battle.
The battle began at 01:00 on 6 July, with Bonin's view of the battle obscured by darkness. The third and fourth Schleswig-Holsteinian redoubts, as well as a nearby mortar battery, were attacked by General De Meza's 'Avantgarden' formation. The fourth redoubt was taken, as well as the battery, and Danish engineers worked to destroy what had been captured. The third redoubt, defended by a part of the 4th Jaegerkorps under the command of Major Schmidt, was able to repulse the Danish attack.
Meanwhile, Olaf Rye had ordered 2 of his 5 battalions to bypass the Treldeskansen (the fifth redoubt) so that they could block Schleswig-Holsteinian reinforcements from reaching it, whilst the other 3 attacked the redoubt, supported by the batteries 'Marcussen' and 'Meincke'. Rye, wanting to move forward to observe the assault better, rode on a horse towards the redoubt. Riding unescorted, his horse was killed, and he went by foot to the 'Marcussen' battery where he got another one. Riding north of the Treldeskansen with a company from the 4th Reserve Battalion, his new horse was shot. Around 03:00, he was shot in the thigh and in the lower abdomen, and died from his wounds a short time after. 
The fighting at the Treldeskansen had turned into a stalemate, but the reinforcement of the Danish troops with the 8th Battalion from Moltke's Brigade and the half-battery 'Tillisch' led to the capture of the redoubt, along with 300 prisoners, by 04:00. Major Stuckradt, commander of the Schleswig-Holsteinian 1st Brigade, which was located on Bonin's left flank, initially decided to withdraw his forces to Egeskov via Rands Fjord, but after being informed that Danish gunboats were guarding the fjord he ordered that his formation move towards Bredstrup. 
With the 6th Battalion from the west, the 8th Battalion from the north, and a company of the 7th Battalion from the second redoubt, the Schleswig-Holsteins counter-attacked, causing the Danish 2nd Lette (Light) Battalion and 2nd Jaegerkorps to retreat, and the attempt to destroy captured Schleswig-Holsteinian equipment stopped. Bonin ordered his last reserve, the 8th Battalion, to press the attack. The Danish Schleppegrells Brigade counter-attacked against the battalion. The first Danish attack against the battalion was repulsed, and whilst they were preparing to launch another one, the sun rose and allowed Bonin to see that the Schleswig-Holsteinian 1st Brigade was retreating. This caused him to order a general retreat to Stoutrup, and the Danish troops began to pursue.
De Meza followed the retreating Schleswig-Holsteins with the Danish advance guard towards Egum and Stallerup, and blocked the withdrawal of the 1st Brigade, capturing 750 prisoners as a result. The left wing of the Schleswig-Holsteinian army was heavily battered, and the area between the town and Rands Fjord was now free from Schleswig-Holsteinian troops. Meanwhile, the Schleppegrells Brigade, supported by 2 companies from the 6th Reserve Battalion, captured the first and second redoubts. In an effort to cover the retreat, the Schleswig-Holsteinian right wing attempted to fight the Danish troops at Stoutrup with two battalions, but they were forced to withdraw from the settlement by the Danish 3rd Jaegerkorps of the 3rd Battalion. To the east of Stoutrup, the Schleswig-Holsteinian artillery park was located, with 100 wagons, a couple of guns and thousands of cannonballs and grenades captured. By 09:00, the main fighting had ended.
Aftermath.
The Danes stopped their pursuit at a ravine west of Fredericia. They had sustained 1 892 dead, wounded, and unwounded captured soldiers; whilst Schleswig-Holstein had suffered 2 995. Despite being outnumbered over 2:1 and sustaining about 500 more dead and wounded, Denmark achieved a victory over Schleswig-Holstein. As a result of the battle, a cease-fire was implemented between the combatants in the First Schleswig War, and all German troops had left Denmark by 25 August. The fighting between Danish and German troops would resume about a year later, when 27 000 Germans and 37 000 Danish troops engaged in the battle of Isted on 24 and 25 July 1850.

Thomas Bray Farm

The Thomas Bray Farm is a historic farmstead at 280 Weir Road in Yarmouth, Massachusetts. It includes a house that is one of the oldest houses in Yarmouth, as well as a number of early 20th century outbuildings, located on about of land adjoining Mill Pond in central Yarmouth. The house construction date has been estimated to be c. 1720, but it is possibly even older. It is an early example of a "half cape", a single story house with one room behind the other, and a chimney between. In a departure from typical plans, the chimney in this house is closer to the center of the roofline, rather than being in the bay behind the front door, which is in the rightmost of three bays.
In addition to the original core of the house, there are two additions off the back which date to the early 20th century. The property also has a number of outbuildings built in the 1920s: a tractor shed, tool shed, and combination well house and root cellar are all located west of the house, and there is a duck blind near Mill Pond. They all appear to have been built from the remains of an old barn that was demolished at the time.
The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

108 (artist)

108 (born 1978) is an Italian artist in the field of street art and contemporary art from Alessandria.
108 has moved from working in traditional graffiti art to painting large and mysterious figures that invade public spaces. He was the first writer to use numbers instead of letters for his name. He started to work when he was a child on the streets of Alessandria, and used different names.
His work has appeared on the streets of Milan, Paris, London, Berlin, and New York City. His first works known by people are enigmatic “blob”-like yellow shapes. It is his firm intention to make visual chaos. His new works are labyrinths, dead trees, non figurative 3D objects and installations, but especially black and gloomy shapes, becoming one of the biggest and influential artists in graffiti abstractism. In the last years, he took part in a lot of international exhibitions: Nusign 2.4 in Paris, Urban Edge Show in Milano, Segundo and Tercer Asalto in Zaragoza and, in 2007 he was invited to join the project called Walls inside the Biennale di Venezia. During March 2008 he was invited to join Nomadaz (a show curated by Pablo Aravena) in Los Angeles with Eltono, Dem, Microbo and other artists to represent Europe in the U.S.A. 108’s doomy black abstractions are engaging and challenging in equal measure. Whether it be within the confines of a small room in the abandoned monastery, where the large triangular constructions are most effective and have the effect of warping and playing with the room’s dimensions as the viewer attempts to back away and comprehend the pieces, or as a surreal floating void on a wall beside a busy road.

Trevor Harley

Trevor Harley is a psychologist specializing in the psychology of language. He is currently Head and Dean of the School of Psychology at the University of Dundee, Scotland, where he holds the Chair of Cognitive Psychology He is author of "The Psychology of Language", currently in its third edition, published by Psychology Press, and "Talking the talk", a book about the psychology of language (psycholinguistics) aimed at a more general audience.
Biography.
Career.
Trevor Harley was born in 1958 in London and grew up near Southampton. He was educated at Price's Grammar School, Fareham. His undergraduate degree was in Natural Sciences at St John's College in the University of Cambridge. He stayed at Cambridge to study for his PhD under the supervision of Brian Butterworth. His PhD was on "slips of the tongue and what they tell us about speech production".
For his PhD and later research he collected a corpus of several thousand naturally occurring speech errors, and focused on one word substitutes for another (e.g. saying "pass the pepper" instead of "pass the salt"). He concluded that speech production is an interactive, parallel process, leading him to an interest in connectionist modeling, and research on computational modeling, ageing, and metacognition.
After his PhD he took a temporary lectureship at the University of Dundee. He then moved to the University of Warwick, where he stayed until 1996, then moving to a Senior Lectureship at Dundee. He was awarded a personal chair in 2003, and became Head of Department in the same year, and later Dean in 2006.
In addition to his academic work, he is an author of a novel, "Dirty old rascal" (ISBN 9781445226224), a fantasy about a cook set in the strange Castle where no misdeed goes unpunished.Harley has published an article, "Why the earth is almost flat: Imaging and the death of cognitive psychology".
Research Interests.
Harley's current main research interest is currently in metacognition, this interest grew out of his research on ageing and his interest in consciousness. More topics about his research on metacognition is covered in his forthcoming book, "Cognition: The mindful brain - why we behave as we do".
Another of his research interest includes how we produce language, although he now studies this in the wider context of how we represent meaning, how language is affected by brain damage, and by normal and pathological ageing (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). He also works on how we control our own cognition, and how this ability changes with age. Underlying all his research is a belief that the mind is a parallel, interactive computer, best studied by experimentation and computational modeling. As well as his interest in language and computational modeling, he was also interested in the research of ageing and metacognition.
He is also interested in the weather, and maintains a site about severe weather events in Britain and the British weather in general available from trevorharley.com, calling this role as a "psychometeorologist". He also carries out psychological research about the weather, including why are people so interested in the weather? He maintains a weather station at Lundie near Dundee.
He wrote a famous article called Promises, Promises in which he argued that cognitive neuropsychologists have increasingly deviated from the original goals and methods of the subject.
The Psychology of Language.
One of Trevor Harley's infamous publications is the book "The Psychology of Language". In this book, he discusses psycholinguistics which is the study of relationships that exist between linguistic behaviour and psychological processes. Harley discusses both the low cognitive level processes, including speech and visual word recognition, and the high cognitive level processes that are involved in comprehension. The text covers recent connectionist models of language, describing complex ideas in a clear and approachable manner. Following a strong developmental theme, the text describes how children acquire language (sometimes more than one), and also how they learn to read.

H. Guy Bedwell

Harvey Guy Bedwell (June 22, 1874 – January 1, 1952) was an American Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse trainer and owner who was the first trainer to win the U.S. Triple Crown.
Born in Roseburg, Oregon he was known by his middle name. As a young man, Guy Bedwell began working as a cowboy and by the early 1900s owned and raced horses in Colorado before moving to the East Coast of the United States. He raced Thoroughbreds from a base at tracks in Maryland and at Empire City Race Track in New York as well as at Old Woodbine Race Course in Toronto, Canada where he became acquainted with the wealthy stable owner, J. K. L. Ross.
In 1909, Bedwell won more races than any trainer in the United States but after New York State legislation banded parimutuel betting and ended racing in that state, Bedwell moved to Kentucky where he conditioned horses at Covington's Latonia Race Track. When racing resumed in New York, Bedwell returned to compete there and repeated as the United States Champion Thoroughbred Trainer by wins from 1912 through 1917. In 1918, he took over as head trainer of the J. K. L. Ross stables in North America. Among his best horses that year was Cudgel who earned American Champion Older Male Horse honors. Bedwell finished 1918 as the United States Champion Thoroughbred Trainer by earnings.
First Triple Crown Champion.
In 1918, Guy Bedwell had two highly regarded two-year-olds in his care. Billy Kelly shared American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors with James W. McClelland's colt, Eternal. The second outstanding runner under Bedwell's care was Milkmaid who is regarded as the best 3-year-old filly in American racing in 1919 and who would be voted American Champion Older Female Horse honors in 1920.
Going into the 1919 season, owner J. K. L. Ross acquired another three-year-old named Sir Barton from John E. Madden. Winless in six starts at two, Sir Barton had good early speed and as such was entered in the Kentucky Derby to serve as a pace-setting "rabbit" for stablemate, Billy Kelly and his jockey, Earl Sande. The combined betting entry of Billy Kelly and Sir Barton were made the second choice among bettors in the Derby behind favorite, Eternal. As planned, jockey Johnny Loftus immediately took the lead and set the pace with Sir Barton but shocked everyone when never relinquished it and won easily by five lengths over Billy Kelly.
Just four days later, Guy Bedwell entered Sir Barton in the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The colt won the race then went on to capture the Withers Stakes in New York and shortly thereafter completed the first Triple Crown in U.S. history by easily winning the Belmont Stakes while setting a track and American record for the then mile and three-eighths race. In addition to Sir Barton, in 1919 Bedwell also trained and raced the Ross-owned filly Constancy who would earn the American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly title. For 1919, Bedwell won his second consecutive national earnings title.
In 1921, Guy Bedwell became part of a dispute involving J. K. L. Ross and the New York Jockey Club over the lifting of the ban on jockey Cal Shilling. Shilling worked for Bedwell as an exercise jockey and also helped with horse conditioning. Bedwell had testified before the Maryland State Racing Commission in support of Shilling's application for a jockey's license and as a result he too became a central figure in the controversy. The April 21, 1921 issue of the "New York Times" quoted from a letter by August Belmont, Jr. to J. K. L. Ross saying "the entries of your stable will not be acceptable to this association if ex-Jockey Carroll Shilling or H. G. Bedwell is in any way connected, directly or indirectly, with the same." The matter resulted in Bedwell's horses racing primarily in Maryland for nearly twenty years before he was allowed to compete again at racetracks in New York State.
After winning the American Triple Crown with Sir Barton, Bedwell never trained another triple crown race winner but in Canada he won the 1924 and 1926 editions of the Breeders' Stakes, a race that now forms part of the Canadian Triple Crown series. After J. K. L. Ross encountered financial problems and was forced to liquidate his stables, Bedwell trained for various owners including, late in his career, for Elizabeth Arden's Maine Chance Farm.
His son, L. G. (Buster) Bedwell, also became a trainer. Still active in racing, Guy Bedwell died of a heart attack in 1952 having won more than 2,100 races. In 1971, he was posthumously inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.
Bedwell was one of the trainers in American Thoroughbred horse racing historian Edward L. Bowen's 2007 book "Masters of the Turf: Ten Trainers Who Dominated Horse Racing's Golden Age".

Glanfeuil Abbey

Glanfeuil Abbey ("Abbaye de Glanfeuil", also known as "Abbaye de Saint-Maur-sur-Loire"), was a French Benedictine monastery in Anjou. The village of Saint-Maur is in the commune of Le Thoureil, in the diocese of Angers and the modern department of Maine-et-Loire. 
It was founded by Saint Maurus, according to the legendary account of abbot Odo of Glanfeuil, or by Benedict of Nursia himself, the teacher of Maurus. The modern common view is that the founder, one Maurus of Glanfeuil, was a distinct person. The site is thought to be that of a Roman villa, and the religious community may date back to the 6th century.
Glanfeuil claimed to be the oldest Benedictine foundation in Gaul. Rorgon I of Maine was perhaps the founder or patron, in 824. In 835 its abbot was Ebroin, future bishop of Poitiers. In 868 the monks of Glanfeuil founded a second monastery, at Saint-Maur-des-Fossés.
The abbey was destroyed by the Normans, but rebuilt. It was suppressed in 1790 in the wake of the French Revolution. Eventually it was refounded in the surviving structures, in 1890, by Louis-Charles Couturier.

James Fields Smathers

James Field Smathers (February 12, 1888 - August 7, 1967) of Kansas City invented what is considered the first practical power-operated typewriter.
Early life.
Smathers was born on a farm near Valley Spring, Texas, the son of James Jefferson and Harriet Olenzo Smathers. After attending the local one-room country school he entered Texas Christian University in 1904. He finished business school, taught shorthand and typing for a year, and in 1908 became typist, accountant, and credit manager to a company in Kansas City, Missouri.
Career.
Smathers realized during the course of his employment that there was a great need for some method of increasing the speed and decreasing the operator fatigue of typing, and it seemed obvious to him that electric power was the answer. By late 1912 he had produced a working model of his electric typewriter and applied for a patent, which was issued the following year.
He continued developing his idea until in September 1914 he produced a perfected model that performed perfectly. In 1920 he obtained an extension of his early patent because of the delay caused in his work by his military service in Europe during World War I.
In 1923 the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester, New York entered into a contract with Smathers for the production of electric typewriters. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers' design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric typewriters were produced powered by Northeast's motors.
After some 2,500 electric typewriters had been produced, Northeast asked Remington for a firm contract for the next batch. However, Remington was engaged in merger talks which would eventually result in the creation of Remington Rand and no executives were willing to commit to a firm order. Northeast instead decided to enter the typewriter business for itself, and in 1929 produced the first Electromatic Typewriter.
In 1928 General Motors' Delco division purchased Northeast Electric, and the typewriter business was spun off as the Electromatic Typewriters, Inc., and in 1933 Electromatic was acquired by IBM and the typewriter sold as the IBM Electromatic. Smathers joined IBM's Rochester staff in 1938 as a consultant and worked in development engineering at Poughkeepsie until his retirement in 1953.
Smathers died on August 7, 1967, in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was buried in Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Mildred Eloise Gill Smathers, and a son and daughter.

Wanda Hjort Heger

Wanda Maria Heger (née Wanda Maria von der Marwitz Hjort, born 9 March 1921) is a Norwegian social worker noted for her efforts to help Norwegian and other prisoners in Nazi concentration camps during World War II.
Background.
Wanda Hjort was the oldest of Johan Bernhard Hjort's six children. J. B. Hjort was a noted lawyer who co-founded the Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling with Vidkun Quisling in 1933. Hjort, however, broke with Nasjonal Samling in 1937 and became part of the Norwegian resistance movement upon the German invasion in 1940 and occupation between 1940 and 1945. He was arrested at the personal order of Josef Terboven and detained in Norway at Møllergata 19 and Grini and then sent to a prison in Berlin. Thanks to intervention by German relatives, Hjort was confined to house arrest at a family estate near Brandenburg called Groß Kreutz on the condition that his entire family join him there.
While in Oslo, Wanda had assisted her father's law practice on behalf of prisoners held by Nazi authorities, and had also taken part in smuggling documents and supplies in and out of prisons there, especially Møllergata 19 and Grini.
Activities in Germany.
Wanda reluctantly arrived in Germany where she, through contacts in the Norwegian seaman's church in Hamburg and the Danish church in Berlin, learned about a growing population of Norwegian prisoners in Sachsenhausen. She and her siblings packed backpacks with some food supplies and travelled by public transportation to the camp gate, telling the camp guards they had packages for the Norwegian prisoners. Among these supplies were two glass jars of potato salad. Since glass jars were in scarce supply, they said they would be back to pick up the empty jars in a week. This started a weekly routine that led to familiarity with the camp guards. Over time Wanda was able to gain access to the package sorting facility (Paketstelle) within the first perimeter of the camp, where she was able to pass messages with Norwegian prisoners who worked there, among them Kristian Ottosen.
These messages, sometimes written on small notes, other times passed orally, enabled the Hjort family (who by now was also joined at Gross Kreutz by the family of former Sachsenhausen prisoner and the rector of the University of Oslo, Didrik Arup Seip) to compile complete and accurate lists of Norwegians held in captivity in Germany, including the all-important prisoner numbers. These lists were sent to the Norwegian government-in-exile in London and were also essential for the success of the Swedish Red Cross and Danish Red Cross White Buses operation, in which she and other family members took an active part.
It is estimated that the White Buses operation saved 15,345 prisoners from mortal peril in concentration and prisoner camps; of these 7,795 were Scandinavian and 7,550 were non-Scandinavian. 
In particular, 423 Danish Jews were saved from the Theresienstadt concentration camp inside German occupied terrority of Czechoslovakia, contributing significantly to the fact that the casualties among Danish Jews during the Holocaust were among the lowest of the occupied countries of Europe. 
During her weekly visits to Sachsenhausen she learned that some of the Norwegian prisoners had been transported to the Natzweiler as Nacht und Nebel prisoners. Under the pretext of visiting Norwegian students in Sennheim she obtained a travel visa to the Alsace region. Aided in part by a letter she had received from Heinrich Himmler through his brother Ernst Himmler in response to her complaint about having to go to Germany, she came close enough to the camp to confirm its existence and that Norwegian prisoners were held there.
Her book "Hver fredag foran porten" (Gyldendal, 1984, later editions 1995 and 2005) about the war years won the prize for being the best documentary book in 1984, and has been translated into German ("Jeden Freitag vor dem Tor", Schneekluth, 1989) and French ("Tous les vendredis devant le portail", Gaia, 2009).
Post-war years.
Immediately after the war ended in 1945, she married Bjørn Heger, a Norwegian medical student released from a prison in Berlin, at the seaman's church in Hamburg. She earned a degree in social work and pursued a career helping female inmates in Norwegian prisons. For several years she also led the organisation "Kriminalomsorg i frihet" (outside-prison organised care for individuals sentenced for crimes). In 1985, both Wanda and Bjørn Heger were awarded the Order of St. Olav for their humanitarian war-time efforts. 
She is now retired and continues to be active in education about the war years, serving on the board of the White Buses Foundation.
She has six children; among them is Anders Heger.

Chace Mills

Chace Mills is a historic textile mill site on Lewiston and Salem Streets in Fall River, Massachusetts. In 1872 the mill was organized and built for the manufacture of cotton cloth with a capacity of 43,480 spindles. It was constructed of native Fall River Granite in the Italianate style. Augustus Chace served as the company's first president. The 6-1/2 story granite mill is the tallest in the city. 
In 1895, a two-story granite addition measuring 310 feet by 120 feet was built for weaving. The company also had a large one-story cotton storage building to the south of Mill No. 2, along the shoreline. The complex also includes two small wooden office buildings in front of the main mill. The mill was taken over by Arkwright in 1929.
The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
In 1999 a fire destroyed the adjacent weave shed and cotton storage buildings, but the main mill was saved, thanks in large part to a favorable winds.

USS Barnegat (SP-1232)

The first USS "Barnegat" (SP-1232) was a commercial tugboat acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was armed with a 3-inch gun and sent to Brest, France, to perform towing services for Allied ships. Post-war, she returned to the United States, was decommissioned, and was subsequently used on the Delaware River by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Built in Camden, New Jersey.
The first ship to be so named by the U.S. Navy, "Barnegat" (Id. No. 1232) was a steel-hulled, single-screw, ocean-going tug. Originally built for the Luckenbach Steamship Co., "Luckenbach Tug No. 1" was completed in 1891 at Camden, New Jersey, by John H. Dialogue. The Navy acquired her “for distant service” on 12 October 1917, assigned her the identification number (Id. No.) 1232, and earmarked her for duty “as a tug to tow large disabled vessels.” 
"Luckenbach Tug No. 1" was commissioned on 12 October 1917, Lt.(jg.) Paul Farley, USNRF, in command. On 30 October 1917, General Order No. 334 directed that "Luckenbach Tug No. 1" be renamed "Barnegat" “at once.”
World War I service.
Crossing the Atlantic Ocean.
"Barnegat" fitted out at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, and was detailed, on 20 November 1917, to accompany the armed yacht "Nokomis" (Id. No. 609) to the Azores, towing submarine chasers. Dispatch traffic, however, indicates difficulties in finding certain items of equipment to be installed on board, the Commander, Naval Station, New York, informing the Navy Department that "Barnegat" and "Montauk" (Id.No.1213) still needed binnacles and standard compasses as of 11 December, but prognosticated that both ships would be ready to sail on the 12th. "Barnegat" ultimately departed New York City for the Philadelphia Navy Yard, there to complete preparations “for distant service” and thence to await onward routing.
At sea mechanical problems.
"Barnegat"- -- with the French submarine chaser SC-171 in tow- -- departed the Delaware Capes on 22 December 1917, bound for Bermuda, as part of a small flotilla of armed tugs and yachts ordered to deliver six submarine chasers built in American shipyards to the French government. "Venetia" (Id.No. 431), the flagship for the convoy, towed "SC-67", "Lydonia" (Id. No. 700), "SC-173"; "Montauk", "SC-29", and "Gypsum Queen" (Id. No. 430), "SC-170" and "SC-172". 
One day out, on the afternoon of 23 December, "Lydonia" reported boiler trouble. Consequently, Comdr. Louis B. Porterfield, the group’s commanding officer, ordered "Montauk" to release "SC 29" and to take "Lydonia" and her charge, "SC-173", astern, and directed "Barnegat" to pick up "SC 29". While "Venetia" stood by, her starboard whaleboat ready to assist the tug if necessary, "Barnegat’s" sailors got the towline on board the French craft at 1600. Then, as "Montauk" and her disabled charge returned toward Norfolk, Virginia, the little flotilla again set course for Bermuda.
During the mid watch on Christmas day, however, "Barnegat" and her tows dropped so far astern of the convoy that "Venetia", with "SC-67" still riding at the end of the towline astern, began searching for them. Hailing "Gypsum Queen" close at hand on her port beam, "Venetia" signaled to “stay close…and keep in sight.” A less than a half hour into the morning watch, at 0425, "Venetia" spotted a light on her starboard bow and began steering toward it. No sooner had the convoy flagship made contact with her one prodigal, but "Gypsum Queen", that had fallen astern during the search for "Barnegat", dropped below the horizon.
"Barnegat" soon informed "Venetia" of her difficulties, promising to be ready to proceed in about two hours. Eventually, by 0945 on Christmas Day, the tug was underway and steaming slowly; by the midpoint in the morning watch, the convoy was on course and together again, with "Venetia’s" log containing the notation that she was steaming various courses and various speeds “to keep in touch with the tugs.”
Regrouping at Bermuda.
The little convoy reached Bermuda shortly before the start of the mid watch on 27 December, with "Barnegat" bringing up the rear; a strong northeasterly wind and nearly continuous rain made the reception chilly and damp, but eventually all of the ships and their tows were safely anchored in Great Sound. "Barnegat" then shifted to His Majesty’s Dockyard, Bermuda, on the afternoon of the 29th. 
"Barnegat’s" executive officer visited "Venetia" on the morning of the 31st; presumably the topic of conversation was voyage repairs, for that afternoon the “exec” returned to the ship with an officer from Prometheus (Repair Ship No. 2). On New Year’s Day, 1918, Ensign John Alexander, USNRF, was detached from "Venetia" with orders to command "Barnegat".
"Venetia" later transferred foodstuffs to "Barnegat" via "Prometheus’s" motor sailer on 5 January, the day that the tug quit the dockyard to anchor in Great Sound. More conferences between commanding officers ensued, probably dealing with the next leg of the voyage, that commenced as the flotilla took departure on 7 January 1918 for the Azores. 
Forming a line of divisions with "Venetia" in the lead, again towing "SC-67"; "Nokomis" and "Galatea" (SP-714) followed, as did "Penobscot" (Id. No. 982), "Nahant" (Id. No. 1250) and "Concord" (Id. No.773); "Barnegat" and "Gypsum Queen" brought up the rear.
Stopping in the Azores.
By the time that "Barnegat" reached Ponta Delgada, Azores, in late January, plans were being broached for her future employment. Vice Admiral William S. Sims, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters, suggested to the Chief of Naval Operations that the majority of vessels assigned to the western bases be tugs. Consequently, he contemplated sending, about 25 January, "Barnegat" (among other vessels) to the French coast to base at Brest. 
She left the dockyard on 5 January; and the flotilla sortied for the Azores two days later. The convoy reached Punta Delgada late in the month, and Barnegat operated in and around that island group into the spring. Highlights of her Azores duty were a run to Horta, Fayal, to tow French submarine chaser "SC 28" to Punta Delgada and a cruise in nearby waters to search for the troopship "Hancock". "Barnegat", with "Gypsum Queen" and two French subchasers, cleared the Azores early in the spring and proceeded to France. Upon their arrival at Brest on 23 April 1918, "Barnegat" and "Gypsum Queen" were assigned to Division 9, Patrol Force.
Homeport in Brest, France.
"Barnegat" operated with that organization through the Armistice, towing vessels that ranged from lighters to battleships and transports. Continuing to operate out of Brest after the fighting ended, she added work as a dispatch vessel and as a passenger ferry to her duties as a tug. Toward the end of her service in Europe, she embarked a party of motion picture photographers on 7 August to film the gigantic transport "Leviathan".
"Barnegat" got underway on 24 September 1919 in company with "Bella" (Id. No. 2211) and "Nahant", bound for the Azores. However, less than 24 hours out, she accidentally rammed and holed "Nahant". Then she and "Bella" stood by their damaged consort until they escorted her back to Brest.
While she waited for "Nahant" to complete repairs, "Barnegat" conducted harbor operations through the first fortnight of October.
Returning to Norfolk, Virginia.
The same trio again left French waters on 15 October. After a brief stop at Punta Delgada, they encountered heavy seas and gale-force winds. Experiencing engine difficulties in the predawn darkness of 3 November, the tug radioed her plight to "Bella" and bridled her bow for towing. "Nahant" passed a hawser to the tug and "Barnegat" remained under tow until late the next afternoon when she was again able to proceed under her own power. 
A few days later, "Nahant" suffered propulsion difficulties and "Barnegat" closely accompanied her to Bermuda. They got underway once more on 24 November and reached Norfolk four days later.
Post-war disposition.
Although no record of "Barnegat's" decommissioning has been found, she was probably inactivated on the day of her arrival at Norfolk or very soon thereafter. The last entry in her log was made on that day. The tug was moved to Philadelphia in February 1920 and lay in the navy yard there until 17 August 1920 when she was ordered transferred to the War Department. 
Thereafter, she was operated in the Delaware River by the Army Corps of Engineers. After 1923, her name disappeared from lists of vessels owned by the Federal Government.

Linda Addison (poet)

Linda D. Addison is an American poet and writer of horror, fantasy, and science fiction. Addison is the first African-American winner of the Bram Stoker Award, which she won twice for her poetry collections "Consumed, Reduced to Beautiful Grey Ashes" (2001) and "Being Full of Light, Insubstantial" (2007). Her current release "How To Recognize A Demon Has Become Your Friend" won the 2011 Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a Poetry Collection. She is a founding member of the CITH (Circles in the Hair) writing group.
Early life.
Addison was born in Philadelphia, PA, on September 8, 1952. She is the eldest of nine children born to Janet Marie Webster (née Warrick) and J. Decarsta Webster. From an early age, Addison was inspired by the power of storytelling. Janet, a homemaker who never graduated from High School; nightly entertained her children with self authored stories and tales, inserting her children as characters in her fantastical fables. The stories always ended on a note of mystery and intrigue, inspiring young Linda to further explore the mysterious and magical, light and dark, eventually she began to journal her feelings, stories and experiences laying the groundwork for her eventual career as a writer.
Addison attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA from 1970–1975, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.
Addison moved to New York City in 1975 with fiancé Ken Addison, and started working in the Foreign Royalty Accounting Department at RCA Records.
Addison married Ken Addison in 1975 and gave birth to son, Brian in 1982.
Career.
In 1996, Addison’s short story “Little Red in the Hood” was published in Tomorrow Speculative Fiction and was listed as an Honorable Mention in the annual Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror anthology (1997).
During her time at Carnegie Mellon, Addison became a fan of legendary Science-Fiction author Isaac Asimov and began regularly submitting short stories for publication to Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine. At the NEW YORK IS BOOK COUNTRY FESTIVAL, Addison met influential Science Fiction Author and Editor Frederik Pohl. As their discussion turned to publication, Pohl advised that in order to get published in Science Fiction “every one has to write a how the dinosaurs died story.” Addison took the advice and from a short story drafted a poem entitled “Why the Dinosaurs Died” it was published in Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine in 1997. Addison went on to be published a total of four times in Asimov’s Magazine between 1997 -1999.
In 1997, Addison published her first Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror collection of short stories, journal entries and poetry entitled Animated Objects. Animated Objects features an introduction by Science Fiction and Fantasy writer Barry N. Malzberg.
African American editor Sheree Thomas put the call out for African American Speculative Fiction writers to submit for a collection that became the groundbreaking anthology: Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction From the African Diaspora Addison’s work was featured along with Octavia E. Butler, Samuel Delaney, Tananarive Due and Walter Mosley. Addison went on to be included in Dark Dreams and Dark Thirst.
Inspired by transformation, a forced reevaluation of her core belief system following the breakdown of her marriage, like a phoenix Addison created the Bram Stoker Award winning poetry collection, Consumed, Reduced to Beautiful Grey Ashes. Addison was the first African American to win this prestigious award. The first book signing for this collection was held on September 11, 2001 at the Barnes & Noble at Rockefeller Center. The first poem in the collection is entitled “Fire/Fight,” although the collection came from Addison’s personal journals and reflections previous to the events of 9/11, critics and fans of the book could not help but connect certain themes to current events, like loss, devastation in conjunction with rebirth, rebuilding and the resilience of the human spirit.
In 2007, her third book of poetry and second Bram Stoker Award winning collection was released: Being Full of Light, Insubstantial. This emotional tour de force was inspired by events beyond Addison’s control. Her beloved mother, Janet was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Addison felt strangely pulled to her office on January 1, 2007. She describes the experience “as something she had never felt before, it was as if a voice came to her in meditation and gently whispered... 100 poems.” The collection that poured from her was an amalgamation of reprints and new poetry. Addison completed her “100th poem” on March 14, 2007.
Addison is a member of the Horror Writers Association (HWA) and annually attends the Northeastern Writers’ Conference (Camp Necon) and has participated in panels with Harlan Ellison, Jack Ketchum and L.A. Banks.
Addison was "Poet Guest of Honor" at The World Horror Convention in 2005.
Addison’s writing has been featured in Essence Magazine, and she is currently the poetry editor for Space and Time Magazine.
Addison has participated in Ellen Datlow’s Fantastic Fiction Reading Series at KGB Bar in NYC.
In March 2012, Addison won her third Bram Stoker Award for How To Recognize A Demon Has Become Your Friend, her latest collection of reprints, new poems and short stories.
Personal life.
Addison separated from Ken Addison in 1992, and her divorce was finalized in 1995. Addison started a relationship with noted Horror Writer, Gerard Houarner in 1995 and they were married at a Voodoo Temple in New Orleans in 2004 by Priestess Miriam.
Addison and Houarner are currently separated.
Addison is an avid practitioner of T'ai chi under the supervision of healer and teacher Rick Barrett.

The book is a compilation of reprints, currently out of print works, new poems and short stories.
The Four Elements is a collection of poetry inspired by the four elements to be released in 2012, and published by Bad Moon Books. The book was inspired by a discussion between Addison and Houarner about female Bram Stoker Award Winners. Addison contacted three Bram Stoker award winning female authors and asked them to choose their “element.” Marge Simon (Earth), Rain Graves (Water), Charlee Jacob (Fire) and Addison (Air).
DARK DUET, a collaborative book of poetry, written with Stephen M. Wilson, inspired by music. It was a finalist for the 2012 Horror Writers Association’s Bram Stoker Award®. Stephen M. Wilson is known for concrete poetry.

History of Kfarsghab

Kfarsghab in Zgharta District in the Mount Lebanon Governorate of Lebanon predates Christianity. However, like most villages in the Qadisha valley, Kfarsghab's history began with the settlement of the Maronites in Mount Lebanon during the 10th Century. According to the popular tradition, the church of Saint Awtel was built on the ruins of a pagan temple. Pagan temples existed in this region as attested in the Greek inscription mentioning the date 272 AD found in the Mar Mama church in Ehden. Other temples may have existed in the region, such as the monastery of Mar Sarkis and Bakhos in Ehden, which may have been built atop ruins. Given the exceptional location of Saint Awtel's Church built on a promontory, the popular tradition about the existence of a pagan temple in Kfarsghab is plausible.
Around 1000 AD.
A possible reference to Kfarsghab may appear in a letter of the Cairo Geniza dating between 1011 and 1037 AD.
The Mamluk period – 1252–1517.
Maronite historians mention Kfarsghab in connection with events of 1283 at the end of the crusading period. It is related to the invasion of Jebbet Bsharri by the Mamluk army and the collaboration of Ibn Al Sabha from Kfarsghab with the Mamluks. El Douaihy (1630-1704) wrote in "Tarikh Al-Azminah" about the role of Ibn Al Sabha during this invasion:
And it was related that the fort that was in Hawqa could not be taken by the Army, which was then advised by Ibn Al Şabĥa from Kfarşghab to divert the water source of Bcherray and direct it against the fort. They thus took it (the fort of Hawqa) by the force of water and brought it to the ground. For that reason, they (the armies) authorized Ibn Al Şabĥa to dress in white Bash Yanis (White clothes reserved to the only Muslims) and the rest of the slaves served him (Ibn Al Şabĥa) and he was very powerful with them. Then, he (Ibn Al Şabĥa) repented of his bad actions and returned and constructed the Monastery of Hawqa close to the fort for the housing of the monks. And the waterway to destroy the fort became reserved since those times and till our days for the usage of the Monasteries in turns, thus on Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays for the Monastery of Qannubine, on Wednesdays for the Monastery of Hawqa Blawza, and on the rest of the days (of the week) for the town of Hadshit and its Waqfs.
This 'betrayal' can be understood in a historic context. At the beginning of the 13th Century, three main powers existed more or less peacefully in the Middle East: the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Ayyubid Sultans in Cairo, Egypt. Each power had its allies in the region. The failure of the Seventh Crusade and the defeat of the Mongols announced the rise of a new power, the Mamluks of Egypt. From 1250 AD, the Mamluks entered actively into the political scene of the Middle East. After securing their rule and in need of legitimacy in the eyes of the Muslim world, the Sultan Baibars started attacking the Franks, seizing Antioch in 1268. From that date, the pre-existing divisions of the native Christians of Lebanon between Pro and Anti-Franks became more marked; especially that the anti-Frankish party finally found in the Mamluks the strong allies it was missing since the First Crusade in 1099. After a first limited Mamluk incursion in Jebbet Bsharri against the village of Hadath in 1268, the Mamluk armies came back to the region in 1283 in a more organized manner, and probably also returned in 1290 after the fall of the Frankish city of Tripoli in 1289. These campaigns were mainly directed against the allies of the Franks in Jebbet Bsharri according to the text of El Douaihy. Their success reinforced the position of the anti-Frankish party to which Ibn Al Sabha belonged.
During the following Mamluk period in Lebanon (1290–1517), few mentions of the village are found. 
In 1470 Kfarsghab is mentioned, in conjunction with the construction of Saint Awtel's Church. It is the only church in Lebanon dedicated to this Saint whose tradition is shared by the Maronite, Orthodox and Jacobite churches.
Another mention, though indirect, stems from the end of the conflict between the Jacobites and Maronites. Profiting from the troubles in Jebbet Bsharri (or maybe called upon for help by the Jacobites), the Muslim Muqaddams of the neighbouring region of Ďanniyeh attacked Ehden in 1489 hoping for a quick victory. The inhabitants of Ehden and of the neighbouring villages, including Kfarşghab, despairing of the help of the Muqaddam of Bsharri, ‘Abdel Mon‘em, pushed back the attackers.
The Ottoman period – 1517–1918.
Following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman Empire entered a long period of conquest and expansion. By defeating the Mamluks in 1517, it achieved control over the Middle East. Jebbet Bsharri entered 4 long centuries under the Ottoman rule.
The 16th century.
The first Ottoman Census of 1519 credited Kfarsghab with 14 male adults (of more than 15 years old), all Christians and married. This figure has allowed historians to estimate the total population by using an average of 6.6 inhabitants per adult male, which gave about 92 inhabitants. The tax money amounted to 1,600 Akçes and its payment reserved to the Waqf of the heirs of Saad Al Moulouk.
The second census of 1571 recorded 12 males in Kfarsghab. The tax amounted to 2,892 Akçes paid to the Waqf of the Two Holy Mosques. There was an amount of 1,068 Akçes paid as Jizya.
In spite of the tax increases due to inflation, Kfarsghab seemed to witness a decrease in its population between 1519 and 1571 of -3 per mil / year. This decrease is attributed to the economic difficulties of the 16th Century in the Middle East, but also to the struggle between Maronites and Jacobites. Kfarsghab stands in the middle of four historical centers of Jacobites in the region: Bqoufa, Bane, Hadshit and Bsharri. It is supposed that some Jacobites lived in Kfarsghab and had to flee the region after they lost the support of Bsharri's Muqaddams around 1550. Both censuses show that Kfarsghab was inhabited by Christians - but with no distinction between Jacobites and Maronites. 
Around 1600, the Kfarsghab population merged with that of the neighboring extinct village of Day’at Moussa or Qaryat Moussa. This merger occurred due to religious disputes. The inhabitants of the village of Qaryat Moussa were accused of being Jacobites since the end of the 14th Century.
The struggle between Maronites and Jacobites in the region started at the beginning of the 15th century and lasted till around the mid-16th Century. It ended with the advantage going to the Maronites. This might have economically and demographically weakened the Jacobite population of Qaryat Moussa. Moreover, the heavy snows which are advanced as the cause behind the disappearance of the neighboring Jacobite village of Bqoufa around 1600 might have given the last stroke to the existence of Qaryat Moussa as an independent agglomeration, obliging its surviving population to take refuge in Kfarsghab.
Historical references of Qaryat Moussa persist till the end of the 16th century, but the village seems to disappear from the records afterwards. The Ottoman census information cited previously credited Qaryat Moussa with 9 males in 1519, all Christians and only 7 of them married. The second census, in 1571, recorded 12 males. This demographic vitality is somewhat intriguing, especially considering the weakening of Kfarsghab's demography over the same period. 
Another reference concerns a Maronite synod that took place in 1598 in Saint Moura, the church of Qaryat Moussa. 
The priest at the time of the 1598 synod, Ibrahim of Qaryat Moussa, was an important aide of the then Patriarch Youssef AlRizzi (1596–1608). AinTourini mentions another synod in this church in 1644. 
Another point of view on the merger and the location of the synod comes from Father Youakim Moubarac when introducing his translation into French of the canons of the Synod:
We put into this translation a particular care because Day`at Moussa overlooks by some hundred meters the village where we were born. However, we cannot help to have some doubt as to the precise location of this Synod. Mart Moura's church, the generally assumed location for that synod celebration, is well known and its patronal saint's day is still celebrated every year with the fervent participation of the faithful from our village Kfarsghab, on September 24. Also, we think that there lies our village of origin, before unknown reasons to the local memory made us go down.
But my family acquired in the time of my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. Would it be rather there the place of celebration of the synod? I prefer to believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which we know that the prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led our Church in those times with three successive patriarchs.
The modern Kfarsghab results from a merge between Kfarsghab and Qaryat Moussa around 1600.
The 17th century.
At the end of the 16th century, the emergence of a first autonomous Lebanese Emirate in the southern Mount Lebanon had important impacts in Jebbet Bsharri. In political terms, it ended in 1621 the role of the Muqaddams of Bsharri as the traditional lords of the region being the official representatives of the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli. In economical terms, the southern Mount Lebanon under the stable rule of the Emir Fakhreddine attracted many families who were encouraged by the Emir to establish there. An important migration took place from Jebbet Bsharri to the south but also to Aleppo, Syria.
The bloody end of the autonomous Emirate in 1635 left Jebbet Bsharri in political confusion. The government was assigned by the Ottomans to two local village sheikhs as joint governors of Jebbet Bsharri: the Sheikh Abi Karam Yaaqoub from Hadath (1635–1640) and the Sheikh Abi Gebrayel Youssef Karam from Ehden (1635–1641). The period that opened up when those two sheikhs disappeared was full of exactions and violence. Given the instability, the people of Jebbet Bsharri insisted in 1654, on the Governor of Tripoli to appoint as governor of their region, Sheikh Ahmad Hamadeh, a member of the powerful Shiite Hamadeh family, rulers of the Jbeil District and Batroun District regions. The Hamadeh did not succeed in establishing stability before the end of the century as they were continuously challenged by the local sheikhs and by members of their own clan.
For Kfarsghab, an important event of this century will take place in 1695 when the Lebanese Maronite Order was founded by three young Maronites from Aleppo, Syria. The Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy encouraged the founders and established them in the Monastery of Mart Moura in Ehden. As the Order grew quickly, they established in Mar Lishaa, Bsharri (1696) and in Qozhaya (1708). In the coming two centuries, the Order will represent a major attraction for the young people of Kfarsghab who will join massively its ranks.
Among the first members of the new Order was Abdallah Habqouq from Kfarsghab. He joined the Lebanese Maronite Order very early in the pioneering days and became administrator (Mudabbir) of the Order in 1698. The family of Father Abdallah Habqouq established in the region in the second part of the 17th century and acquired the monastery of Qozhaya from the Gilwan family, owners of Qozhaya since 1567. The Habqouq family, and specifically Bishop Youhanna Habqouq, surrendered Qozhaya to the Lebanese Maronite Order in 1708.
The 18th century.
In the beginning of the 18th century, the Jebbet Bsharri region was in a very poor state following the conflicts that had taken place in the past 70 years. Many villages were depopulated, land was abandoned. After 1677 the Hamadeh encouraged people from their fiefdoms of Jbeil District and Batroun District to migrate to Jebbet Bsharri in order to populate the area, as requested of them by the Governor of Tripoli. But only in 1704 did the Hamadeh succeed in securing their rule of Jebbet Bsharri and in showing some results in their repopulation efforts, especially as the situation in the south Mount Lebanon was plagued by the Qaissites / Yamanites conflict and then by the succession conflicts triggered by the fall of the house of Maans in 1697. For Kfarsghab, it is supposed that the main four families that compose the today's Kfarsghab came to the region from 1677 to 1704.
The foundation of the modern Kfarsghab (1704–1761).
The Abou Mansour family.
It is between 1677 and 1704 that the family Abou Mansour Al Bahri arrived in Jebbet Bsharri from the coast of the Batroun District. They established themselves in Kfarsghab merging slowly with the few surviving natives, possibly from the Saliba family as recorded by the tradition. 
The new-comers helped the Hamadeh in the administration of the region as it is shown in the records of the Court of Tripoli. 
Those records show that, 
The Abou Youssef family.
The Abou Youssef Elias family came to the Jebbet Bsharri region in the beginning of 17th Century from Smar Jbeil, the village of the Gilwan family, ex-owners of the Monastery of Qozhaya. In another documented version, This family could have come originally from Benta‘el in the Jbeil region. This family was encouraged to settle in the region by the Gilwan's and maybe the Hamadeh sheikhs. They settled first in Tourza and Arbet Qozhaya, working as sharecroppers of the Monastery of Qozhaya. After Qozhaya was handed down to the Lebanese Maronite Order in 1708, they moved to Kfarsghab between 1710 and 1720.
In the tradition of the village of Kfarsghab, Abou Youssef Elias married a daughter of the Abou Mansour Al Bahri family : The first inhabitant ever recorded was Deeb El Bahri. Deeb came from the coast of Batroun and established himself in the district. He married Maureena El Saliba and had three Sons that are the origins of the three families - Abou Mansour, Khoury Youssef and Abou Abraham. The family of Abou Youssef was a descendant of Elias who came to Kfarsghab from the Coast and married a granddaughter of Deeb El Bahri …
In 1748, Abou Youssef Elias from Kfarsghab bought from Sheikh Assaad Hamadeh the land that will become later the village of Morh Kfarsghab. In the property deed established between the two men, Assaad Hamadeh referred to Abou Youssef Elias as "our beloved" and not with the title "Sheikh". This personal reference could imply that Abou Youssef Elias was close to Assaad Hamadeh.
In 1755, the guarantor of Assaad Hamadeh at the Court of Tripoli was the Sheikh Elias Abou Youssef son of Bahri or Al Bahri. In spite of the name Al Bahri added to the name of this last sheikh, this sheikh is Abou Youssef Elias, married to a daughter of Al Bahri family.It seems that, between 1748 and 1755, Abou Youssef Elias became powerful enough to claim the sheikhdom of Kfarsghab and take it from his relatives by his wife, the Abou Mansour Al Bahri. 
The Sheikh and his descendants will play an important role in the history of Kfarsghab and of Jebbet Bsharri.
The Habqouq family.
This family arrived in Kfarsghab in the beginning of the 18th Century. Like the Abou Youssef Elias family, the Habqouq have bought the Monastery of Qozhaya from the Gilwan family in the second half of the 17th Century. The family came from Bsheeleh in the Batroun region and before that from Bikfaya in Metn and Jeita in Keserwan District. The priests of the family settled in the Monastery of Qozhaya and their families in Arbet Qozhaya and in Bane. It is this family that gave Qozhaya to the Lebanese Maronite Order in 1708. It is probably after this event that part of the family moved from Arbet Qozhaya to Kfarsghab, the other part stayed in Bane.
This family gave the Maronite Church several illustrious sons, like Abdallah Habqouq (1670–1758). Abdallah Habqouq from Kfarsghab joined the Lebanese Maronite Order very early in the pioneering days. He was administrator (Mudabbir) of the Order between 1698 and 1732 and then between 1738 and 1742. From 1729 to 1735 and then from 1742 to 1743, he was superior of the Monastery of Our Lady of Tamish, an important Monastery that became in 1744 the siege of the Baladites Order (after the split of the Order into two Orders: Baladites and Halabites).
Father Abdallah was consecrated Bishop on 20 May 1742 by the Bishop Tubiya Al Khazin ( future Patriarch 1756–1766). This consecration was done in a context of conflict over the succession of Patriarch Yusuf Dargham Al Khazin between Tubiya Al Khazin and Ilyas Muhasib. This conflict was eventually settled by the Vatican by the election of Simaan Awwad and the confirmation of the consecration of Bishop Abdallah Habqouq. Bishop Abdallah is mentioned as a signatory of a legal document in his capaity of bishop in 1744, next to the name of the Patriarch Simaan Awwad.
Apparently Bishop Abdallah sided with the Halabites faction of the Order as no records for his death are found in the Baladites faction archives.
Bishop Abdallah died on 7 August 1758 in Kfarsghab and is buried in Saint Awtel Church.
The Khouriyyeh family.
Allied to the Abou Mansour family, the origin of this family could be traced to Aqoura, in the mountains of Jbeil. Its date of arrival in Kfarsghab is difficult to estimate. But given the fact that a Sheikh Hanna son of Rizk (from the Khourriyeh family) is cited in the records of the Court of Tripoli for the year 1761, this family had been settled in Kfarsghab for some time, most probably in the first part of the 18th Century.
The bourgeois Sheikhs rise (1761–1772).
The major event of the eighteenth century for Jebbet Bsharri happened in 1761 when Abou Youssef Elias from Kfarsghab, along with Hanna Al Daher from Bsharri, Gerges Boulos El Douaihy from Ehden and Abou Sleimane Aouad from Hasroun, took all together the direct collection of the taxes of Jebbet Bsharri from the Governor of Tripoli, Osman Pacha the Georgian. They were helped by some of the traditional Sheikhs who guaranteed at the Court of Tripoli the payment of the taxes. It was the first serious defeat of the Hamadeh in this century and the rise of a new generation of local Maronite Sheikhs, called here "Bourgeois Sheikhs". 
But the Hamadeh counter-attacked, helped most probably by local people from Bsharri and Hasroun. In their struggle against the Hamadeh that lasted from 1760 till 1772, the bourgeois Sheikhs of Jebbet Bsharri got the support of the Governors of Tripoli, Osman Pasha and his son Mohammad Pasha, of the Sunnite Sheikhs of Danniyeh and of the Sheikhs of Zawiyeh. In 1763, the ambitious Emir Youssef Al Shihabi (ruled afterwards Mount Lebanon from 1770 to 1789) installed in the Jbeil region and being himself in conflict with the Hamadeh, profited from the difficulties of the Bourgeois Sheikhs and maneuvered to take from them the collection of taxes in Jebbet Bsharri. He contracted an alliance with the Bourgeois Sheikhs and confirmed their privileges in the tax collection of their districts as well as their right to claim the abandoned properties of the Hamadeh (Baklik). The fight with the Hamadeh will continue for 12 years. It will lead to their eviction from the whole region and to their final defeat in 1772. The Emir Youssef Al Shihabi, and his Shihabis successors, will have the direct rule of Jebbet Bsharri for almost one century from 1763 till 1844, helped by the new generation of "Bourgeois Village Sheiks" of Jebbet Bsharri: El Douaihy, Estephane, Awwad and Daher, but also Khattar and Issa Al Khoury.
In 1761, the guarantor of Abou Youssef Elias was a certain Sheikh Hanna son of Rizk from Kfarsghab. This family appeared as sheikhs of Kfarsghab for the first time. Apparently, Abou Youssef Elias was representing by marriage the Abou Mansour family as witnessed by the last name Al Bahri added to his own name in the records of the Court. In taking a guarantor from the Rizk family, he ensured the loyalty and support of other families of Kfarsghab.
The development of Kfarsghab (1772–1799).
The last part of this century saw the economic development of Kfarsghab. Sheikh Abou Youssef Elias will deploy an important energy, till his death on December 12, 1785. The foundation in 1748 and then extension of Morh Kfarsghab on the "Baklik" land of the Hamadeh was necessary for the silkworm industrial development, especially during wintertime, as the European demand for Lebanese silk was important in that century. Also the extension of Mar Awtel church in 1776 must have been necessary to accommodate the increasing population.
From 1755, the Sheikhs of Kfarsghab will be from the Abou Youssef Elias family, and specifically from the Estephane branch of the family. This family ran the administration of the villages of Kfarsghab, Toula, half of Karmsaddeh and half of Raskifa. For those two last villages, they shared the administration with another Bourgeois Sheikhs family, the Aouad from Hasroun. In fact, the Estephane family ruled exactly the same domain (Oktaa) as Sheikh Assaad Hamadeh, who ruled Kfarsghab in the previous period.
This century would have witnessed the beginning of an important movement for Kfarsghab that will be at its apogee in the following century; that is to say the massive monastic vows among the natives of Kfarsghab. During the 18th century, more than 12 young men joined the ranks of the Lebanese Maronite Order. The demographic weakness of Kfarsghab in the first half of the century, the purchase of the winter village of Morh Kfarsghab and its development starting in 1748 and possibly the conflict inside the Order that started in 1748 between the Aleppine monks and the Lebanese ones and that eventually led to the splitting of the order into two in 1768, could be behind this modest number of monks from Kfarsghab. It will have a major impact on Kfarsghab.
The 19th century.
The 19th Century was a much contrasted century for Lebanon. It witnessed the evolution from a traditional peasant society tightly governed by the Sheikhs to a more modern dynamic society opened to the outside world.
The monastic orders (1840–1870).
The first major evolution for Kfarsghab was the massive attraction of the monastic orders especially that of the Lebanese Maronite Order solidly installed in the neighbouring Monastery of Qozhaya. The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed a doubling in the vocations from Kfarsghab. Between 1800 and 1850, the Order received 8 to 10 monks from Kfarsghab. Between 1850 and 1875, things changed dramatically. In this period, more than 23 monks from Kfarsghab took their vows.
It is explained by a surge in the number of births in Kfarsghab in the 1830s due to the improvement of the economic conditions favoured by the development of silk. In 1829, there were 125 houses in Kfarsghab. Considering the average size of a household to be of 10, then the number of inhabitants of Kfarsghab was of 1250. The census of 1849 made state of 374 males, that is to say roughly a total of 1,870 people (number of males multiplied by 5). 
The baby-boomers of the 1830–1840's started joining massively the Monk Orders. One major factor was the decline in the revenues derived from silk in Jebbet Bsharri region that started around 1845. In 1844–1845, silk revenues were covering 72% of the economic needs decreasing to 25% in 1851–1852 and further to 15% in 1857. Along with an increased centralization of the administration under the new regime of Qaym-maqiyamatayn (1842–1860), it contributed to the weakening of the political and economical powers of the sheikhs in the region in general leaving no economic perspectives to the young people. Also, the opening of a school in the neighbouring village of Bane in 1806 by the Lebanese Maronite Order for the basic instruction of the children of Kfarsghab and Bane served as a channel of detection and recruitment of talents and workforce for the Order. The effect was a reduction in the Kfarsghab population. According to a recent study, 344 males lived in Kfarsghab in 1862, that is to say 1,720 inhabitants.
The emigration (1870–1899).
In the 1870s, vocations among the natives of Kfarsghab started to decrease. Between 1875 and 1900, only 3 vocations were recorded for Kfarsghab. Vocations from Kfarsghab ceased on 17 December 1898 when Br Ephraim Saliba Abboud II joined. Brother Ephraim died on 9 April 1947. Overall, the Lebanese Maronite Order attracted 43 young people from Kfarsghab, making this village the 15th most important contributor to the Order, among the 382 villages that counted monks among their sons. Still in 1900, Kfarsghab counted 13 monks among its sons, representing 4% of the adult male population compared to 0.8% for the average of the region of Jebbet Bsharri.
Looking at the names and the monasteries of the monks from Kfarsghab, 75% of them were assigned to monasteries located in North Lebanon, most of them being in Qozhaya. The objective of the reform that took place after the revolt of Qozhaya in 1875 was to assign the monks in a different region from their region of origin. 4 monks of Kfarsghab participated in the 1875 revolt, one of them, brother Boutros, being among its leaders. As a result, the power of Qozhaya was broken, its lands divided between several monasteries and its monks (around 200 at its height) distributed in different Monasteries. It is possible, according to some historians, that this reform could have had a negative impact on the vocations from Jebbet Bsharri. 
The special status of Mount Lebanon during the Regime of Mutasarrifiah (1861–1914) changed the administration of Kfarsghab which was attached to the distant district of Batroun. The collapse of the prices of silk from the 1870s and onward deteriorated the economic situation. Politically and economically, the Sheikhs of Kfarsghab were weakened. Finally, the loss of interest in the monks order was replaced soon by the emigration to the USA and to Australia.
Emigration from Kfarsghab to the United States started in 1885, followed by an emigration to Australia in 1887. It resulted in a dramatic decrease in the Kfarsghab population. In 1889, the number of inhabitants was estimated to 1,100. For Year 1900,it is reported 330 male adults, 950 inhabitants and 150 emigrants for Kfarsghab. Kfarsghab lost to the emigration 20% of its population in less than 15 years. This trend will continue in the 20th Century.

<doc id="18446410" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18446410" title="Jean Thierry du Mont, comte de Gages">
Jean Thierry du Mont, comte de Gages

Jean Bonaventure Thierry du Mont, comte de Gages (Mons, now in Belgium, 27 December 1682 – Pamplona, Spain, 31 January 1753), Viceroy of Navarre, 1746–1753, a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1745, was a Walloon born Spanish General who was awarded by King Philip V of Spain in 1745 the title of "Conde", "Count", of Gages, a village near Brugelette in Hainaut.
Life.
A lieutenant in the Walloon Guards, du Mont fought for the Spanish in many battles during the War of Spanish Succession, distinguishing himself in the Battle of Villaviciosa, and he also took part in the Spanish expedition to Oran (1732). 
du Mont is best known for his role in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), a.k.a. King George's War in North America, and incorporating the War of Jenkins' Ear between Great-Britain and Spain.
The war in Italy was fought between a French-Spanish coalition, commanded by Infante Felipe, son of king Philip V of Spain, assisted between others by the French Marshal Maillebois, and du Mont as Captain General of the Spanish and Neapolitan armies on the one hand, and an Austrian-Sardinian coalition, backed by Great-Britain on the other hand.
During the War of Polish Succession (1733-1738), Spain had retrieved Naples and Sicily, but failed to retake Milan and Parma. Now King Philip V, but mostly his second wife, energetic and ambitious former Italian Princess Elizabeth of Parma, wanted to retake all former Spanish territories in Italy for her son King Charles VII of Naples and Sicily. 
On February 8, 1743, du Mont defeated the Austrians and Sardinians at the Battle of Campo Santo, followed later from September to December 1745 by the 2nd Battle of Milan, 1745 which was widely considered a victory in Madrid. 
When Marshal Saxe defeated the British Army at Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 and overran the Low Countries, the Spanish Crown granted du Mont the county of Gages, near his birthplace until then occupied by the Austrians since 1713.
Meanwhile, "Juan de Gages" as he was usually called by his Spanish-Neapolitan soldiers, fought against the Austrians in the Milanese and Piedmont, Parma and Piacenza supported by the Genoese. Towards the end of 1745 Alexandria and Milan were also conquered, but then the chances of war turned. 
The Austrians took back Milan on 18 March 1746 and the Spanish-Neapolitan army under the count of Gages was beaten by the Austrians at the Battle of Piacenza (16 June 1746), and the Battle of Tidone (10 August 1746). Enough was enough, moneywise and blood wise. The new King of Spain, Ferdinand VI of Spain, the half brother of King Charles of Naples and Sicily (later also King of Spain under the name Charles III of Spain), was probably well advised to stop all these adventurous and costly wars. 
Juan Buenaventura Thierry du Mont was after the war awarded the title of Viceroy of Navarre in 1749. Some 4 years later he died there, in Pamplona, 1753. He was much interested in paving adequately many roads used during many centuries taking particular care on any Roman remains in or around such roads. His tomb was moved several times, specially during the Napoleonic Wars to avoid desecration by the French Imperial soldiers. After two or more moves, his mausoleum was placed in the cloister of the Pamplona Cathedral, where it can be seen today.

Independent Community Bankers of America

The Independent Community Bankers of America® (ICBA), the nation’s voice for nearly 7,000 community banks of all sizes and charter types, is dedicated exclusively to representing the interests of the community banking industry and its membership through effective advocacy, best-in-class education and high-quality products and services.
With nearly 5,000 members, representing more than 24,000 locations nationwide and employing 300,000 Americans, ICBA members hold $1.2 trillion in assets, $1 trillion in deposits, and $750 billion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community. 
ICBA supports fair competition for financial institutions, maintaining the separation of banking and commerce, and a balanced financial system to prevent the concentration of economic and financial-services resources. ICBA member community banks create symbiotic relationships with the communities they serve, favor local decision-making, while adhering to the highest business practices and ethical standards, and support a democratically governed association where each member bank has a voice and a vote.
ICBA is committed to upholding the highest professional standards in community banking and providing programs tailored specifically for community bankers. Through ICBA educational courses, certification options and continuing education programs, community bankers are better able to serve their customers and stay profitable. 
ICBA History
According to its 75th Anniversary historic guide, on May 9, 1930, 28 independent community bankers met in Glenwood, Minn., to discuss the situations surrounding the banking industry in Minnesota at the time. These bankers were alarmed by what they saw as a threat of the concentration of banking resources in their state and region. A huge California bank was buying up banks throughout the country – a move that these independent bankers saw as a potential first step toward nationwide branch banking. In 1930, there were about 14,700 commercial banks, and about 73 percent of those banks, had assets of less than $50 million. 
The association was founded as the Independent Bankers Association of America in 1930, and then later changed its name nearly 70 years later to the Independent Community Bankers of America in 1999.
ICBA celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2005 and anticipates continued success and growth among community banks in the future.
ICBA President and CEO, Camden R. Fine, once said “community banks work hard to improve the quality of life for Americans and their communities,” which is a statement the founding 28 ICBA members had when they began the association. 
ICBA Locations
ICBA has dozens of regional offices and locations to better serve community banks and their customers nationwide. Until 1979, ICBA’s main location was in Sauk Centre, Minnesota.

The majority of community bank officers are generally accessible to their customers on-site. They are typically deeply involved in local community affairs and are also willing to consider character, family history and discretionary spending in making loans to customers. 
Every April, ICBA and community banks celebrate Community Banking Month.

Graham Walker (motorcycle racer)

Graham William Walker (1896 – 7 September 1962) was an English motorcycle racer, broadcaster and journalist. He also contributed greatly to the motorcycle section of the National Motor Museum.
Graham Walker was born in Wallington, Surrey and was the son of William and Jessie Walker. He had five siblings - three brothers and two sisters. Walker married Elsie Spratt and together they had one son, Graeme Murray Walker (born 10 October 1923) who went on to have a long career as a motorsport commentator.
Walker was a motorcycle despatch rider in the First World War for the Royal Engineers Signal Service, where he received a leg injury requiring him to ride a motorcycle with a modified brake pedal. Despite this he had a successful racing career with Rudge, Sunbeam and Norton. Riding a 493cc Sunbeam he was a member of the victorious British International Trophy Team at the ISDT held in Buxton 1926 and Ambleside 1927 then saw success on the Silver Vase team in 1928 at Harrogate and 1932 Merano in Italy. Road successes included winning the Ulster Grand Prix on a Rudge Ulster in 1928, the first road race win with an average of 80 mph. Walker also won the 350cc class at the 1931 North West 200, again on a Rudge. He rode many times in the Isle of Man TT, winning the lightweight (250cc) class in 1931, and became president of the TT Riders Association.
During World War II, Walker took part in a campaign to recruit new dispatch riders.
In 1935, after his motorcycle racing career had finished, Walker was employed by the BBC as a commentator for motorcycle racing events on television and radio. In 1949, Walker was partnered on the BBC's motorcycle commentaries with his son, Murray.
He was editor of "Motor Cycling magazine" from 1938 to 1954 and he then took up a directorship at the Montagu Motor Museum, of which his enthusiasm for preserving historic motorcycles partly led to the museum having opened a motorcycle section in 1956.

BioRegional

BioRegional is an entrepreneurial charity, which aims to invent and deliver practical solutions for sustainability. It was founded in 1992 on the belief that overconsumption of resources was the driving force behind environmental degradation, and set out to find new ways to meet more of their needs from local resources.
BioRegional describe their vision of ""a future in which everyone can enjoy a high quality of life, while living within their fair share of the Earth’s resources and leaving space for wildlife and wilderness."" Their approach is similar to that of Bioregionalism, more popular in North America, but from a more mainstream, commercial angle.
History.
BioRegional was founded in 1992 by Sue Riddlestone and Pooran Desai OBE, and began life in the Sutton Ecology Centre. They first worked on local environmental projects, including the promotion of closed loop recycling in London and Surrey, reviving lavender production in Mitcham and Carshalton, setting up Croydon's TreeStation to turn waste municipal wood into biomass, and establishing the BioRegional Charcoal Company Ltd who help a network of local charcoal producers sell to major retail stores. These projects reflected BioRegional's aim of setting up social enterprises that could make the use of local and waste resources mainstream.
BioRegional began to expand in the late 1990s, and with the completion of BedZED they moved into their present offices in Hackbridge, London Borough of Sutton. From BedZED they developed with One Planet Living programme with WWF, which is the framework for all sustainable communities projects and has an equal influence over their vision as the original bioregionalism focus. Currently a One Planet Living communities is being built in Brighton.
BioRegional currently have around 40 staff in London, as well as regional offices in China, Canada, South Africa, Kenya, Greece, Mexico, and Australia.
Founded in 2005, BioRegional North America is an affiliated Canadian non-profit organisation that specializes in fostering sustainable behavior change and collaborative consumption amongst occupants in new and existing buildings across the United States and Canada.

William Lester DeMars (born August 26, 1925, at Brooklyn, New York) is a retired American shortstop and coach in Major League Baseball. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed during his playing career.
Originally signed by his hometown Brooklyn Dodgers during the Second World War, DeMars was selected by the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1947 rule 5 draft after batting .328 with 88 runs batted in for the Class B Asheville Tourists of the Tri-State League – DeMars' best overall season in professional baseball. He played 80 major league games over three seasons (; –) for the A's and the St. Louis Browns, batting .237 with no home runs and 14 RBI in 211 at bats. He spent the prime of his career with the AAA Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League from 1952–1955.
On May 25, 1958, DeMars began an 11-year minor league managerial career in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system with the Class C Aberdeen Pheasants of the Northern League, who had lost 23 of their first 25 games. While the Pheasants continued to flounder under DeMars, winning only 37 of 100 games, the improved performance earned DeMars an invitation to return to the Orioles' system with the Class C Stockton Ports of the California League in 1959, where he posted a winning record. He managed in the Baltimore organization through 1968 — working alongside future Major League managers such as Earl Weaver, Joe Altobelli, Darrell Johnson, Jim Frey, Clyde King, Cal Ripken, Sr., and Billy Hunter. He succeeded Weaver as pilot of the AAA Rochester Red Wings in 1968, and led the Red Wings into the playoffs. Overall, his managing record was 711 wins, 729 losses (.493) with one championship, won with the Class A Fox Cities Foxes of the Midwest League in 1964.
DeMars began a 19-year Major League coaching career with the Philadelphia Phillies, eventually becoming one of the most respected batting coaches in the game. He was a member of the Phillies' staff for 13 seasons, including the world championship club – first in Phillies' history — and National League East Division champion teams in 1976–1977–1978. DeMars left the Phils after the season and coached six more seasons with the Montreal Expos (1982–1984) and Cincinnati Reds (1985–1987), where he was a key advisor to playing manager Pete Rose; Rose called DeMars the best hitting coach with whom he had ever worked. Although his 1987 resignation from the Cincinnati coaching staff ended his MLB career, DeMars would remain in baseball, and return to the Phillies, as a roving minor league batting instructor during the 1990s.

Mafersa coaches are railroad cars originally built for Virginia Railway Express. They have rounded roofs and manually operated entry doors. In 2004, they were sold to Shore Line East. Because of their lack of automatic doors they are prohibited from running into Grand Central Terminal. In addition, the undercarriage clearances preclude running at more than in third rail territory as found south and west of Pelham. Hence, the Connecticut Department of Transportation does not use them in the Metro North Railroad equipment pool. The cab cars numbered 1701–1717.

Çarşı's symbol refers to the symbol of anarchism and has a common fame for the left-leaning character of its supporters who may be counted as anti-racist, anti-fascist, anti-sexist, pluralist and ecologist.
In May 2008, Çarşı disbanded itself unexpectedly. However, in the 2013 Turkish protests, Çarşı was a central mobilizing force for anti-Erdogan protests.
Definition.
In Turkey; Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray are accepted as the biggest three clubs (Trabzonspor is the fourth occasionally), as they are the most successful ones in Turkish football history, and have the highest number of supporters. There are also numerous supporter groups of many teams, i.e. ultrAslan for Galatasaray, Genç FB and Kill For You for Fenerbahçe, Group Yalı for Göztepe A.Ş.. The groups' names are related to a team’s name or badge, the symbol of the city, or a specific place inside the city. The name 'Çarşı' is also an example for this situation. Çarşı literally means "Marketplace" in Turkish. In the 1980s, the young people of Beşiktaş district who were supporting Beşiktaş J.K. were usually spending their time around the bazaar, located in the center of the district. They were living, coming together and supporting the team together in that specific place. This lifestyle led them to found the group with the name of Çarşı in 1982.
Although Çarşı is basically accepted as a fan group, Çarşı may be defined better as a common way of acting, including the shared beliefs of the fans; therefore Çarşı is a dignity, or a form of common soul among Beşiktaş fans. According to a well-known fan, Alp Batu Keçeci, Çarşı is described as an abstract notion rather than a basic and solid fan group.
This definition collected positive reactions of the supporters and it was embraced over time. Many of the internet fan forums have given place for this article.
Characteristics.
Çarşı separates itself from other Beşiktaş fan groups by its members' attitude during the matches, and with their placards. The group was formed in 1981–82 season and their fame began to spread in the '90s. Çarşı does not have a homogenous structure and it does not consist of a certain group of people with a specific identity. People from different social backgrounds, cultural environments, and ethnic origins are assembled at the group even though they support opposite ways of thinking in terms of politics or ideologies. An all-around antagonist image and attitude represent the basic characteristics of the group.
The name of the group comes from the central market place of Beşiktaş district, which is located in downtown, near the Istanbul Bosphorus. "Beşiktaş Çarşı" contains many restaurants, bars, a big fish market, and also numerous cosmetics, clothing and technology shops. There the fans assemble and pass their time with various activities until the matches. It is possible to see the fans on match days, wearing black-and-white jerseys at the fish restaurants and bars. Also, the newly produced chants by Beşiktaş fans are usually sung and embraced for the first time in Beşiktaş Çarşı.
After their meetings, fans generally walk to the home ground, İnönü Stadium passing Dolmabahçe Palace. They generally prefer to arrive there about 2 or 3 hours before the matches; however, majority of people do not get in the stadium instantly. They also like to hang around the stadium just before going in, for different reasons such as meeting their friends, to have some drinks or to chant right before the matches.
In Istanbul, supporters live on both the European and Asian sides of the Bosphorus, and so do Çarşı members. The inhabitants of the Asian side travel to the stadium by both road and sea transportation, but sea transportation is used more frequently. The fans mainly get on the ferries from Kadıköy or Üsküdar districts, where they can arrive at Beşiktaş in approximately 20 minutes. 
There are both directly related members of group and just normal supporters who want to be a part of action; also it is likely to see many university students among the members. Therefore, the group stand out with its quip, witty and humorist aspect. Çarşı generally react the topics and incidents with an unexpected manner.
Çarşı utilize some symbols to express their opinions. One of them is a derivative form of letter A, as it is used in the notion of anarchy. However, Çarşı states that they re-shaped the symbol with extending the low ends of the letter to show the difference. Hence, they use the letter as a symbol of rebellious soul (). This idea was the inspiration for the name of the TV documentary "Asi Ruh" dedicated to the group, which was begun in 2007 (the group's 25th anniversary) and which came out on DVD in 2008.
The assortment of support is very wide; teenage and elderly fans alike consider themselves members and participate. The fans wear the official team products as well as the products based on Çarşı.
Defunction and reactions.
On 28 May 2008, Çarşı concluded its presence by a farewell letter written by Alen Markaryan, arguably the main cheerleader (). During the Press Gala of ‘’Asi Ruh’’ documentary, Markaryan declared that they decided to disband the group after discussions which questioned the group’s position as coming before Beşiktaş J.K. itself for the supporters. According to the newspapers, some subsequent reactions came up even in the gala. Discussions not yet finished. In internet forums, some users cite that they are proponents of the decision, but are also showing the tendency to keep the group's ideology and legacy. On the other hand, there are also users who believe that Çarşı cannot be ended like a defunct organization, as its roots are deeper and more philosophical than those of a typical fan group.
2013 Turkey protests.
Çarşı played a significant role in the 2013 protests in Turkey, resisting police attacks and even chasing a water cannon away with an excavator they acquired.

Microplasma

Microplasmas are plasmas of small dimensions, ranging from tens to thousands of micrometers. They can be generated at a variety of temperatures and pressures, existing as either thermal or non-thermal plasmas. Non-thermal microplasmas that can maintain their state at standard temperatures and pressures are readily available and accessible to scientists as they can be easily sustained and manipulated under standard conditions. Therefore they can be employed for commercial, industrial, and medical applications, giving rise to the evolving field of microplasmas.
What is a Microplasma?
There are 4 states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Plasmas make up more than 99% of the visible universe. In general, when energy is applied to a gas, internal electrons of gas molecules (atoms) are excited and move up to higher energy level. If the energy applied is high enough, outermost electron(s) can even be stripped off the molecules (atoms), forming ions. Electrons, molecules (atoms), excited species and ions form a soup of species which involves many interactions between species and demonstrate collective behavior under the influence of external electric and magnetic fields. Light always accompanies plasmas: as the excited species relax and move to lower energy levels, energy is released in the form of light. Microplasma is a subdivision of plasma in which the dimensions of the plasma can range between tens, hundreds, or even thousands of micrometers in size. The majority of microplasmas that are employed in commercial applications are cold plasmas. In a cold plasma, electrons have much higher energy than the accompanying ions and neutrals. Microplasmas are typically generated at elevated pressure to atmospheric pressure or higher.
Successful ignition of microplasmas is governed by Paschen's Law, which describes the breakdown
voltage (the voltage at which the plasma begins to arc) as a function of the product of electrode distance
and pressure,
where pd is the product of pressure and distance, and a and b are gas constants related to the gas(es) being used.
As the pressure increases, the distance between the electrodes must
decrease to achieve the same breakdown voltage. This law is proven to be valid at inter-electrode distances as small as tens of micrometers and pressures higher than atmospheric. However, its validity at even smaller scales (approaching debye length) is still currently under investigation.
Generating Microplasmas.
While microplasma devices have been studied experimentally for more than a decade, understanding has been spurred in the past few years as the result of modelling and computational investigations of microplasmas.
Confinement To Small Spaces.
When the pressure of the gas medium in which the microplasma is generated increases, the distance between the electrodes must decrease to maintain the same breakdown voltage. In such microhollow cathode discharges, the product of pressure and distance ranges from fractions of Torr cm to about 10 Torr cm. At values below 5 Torr cm, the discharges are called "pre-discharges" and are low intensity glow discharges. Above 10 Torr cm the discharge can become uncontrollable and extend from the anode to random locations within the cavity. Further research by David Staack provided a graph of ideal electrode distances, voltages, and carrier gases tested for microplasma generation.
Dielectric Materials.
Dielectrics are poor electrical conductors, but support electrostatic fields and electric
polarization. Dielectric barrier discharge microplasmas are typically created between metal plates, which are covered by a thin layer of dielectric or highly resistive material. The dielectric layer plays an important role in suppressing the current: the cathode/anode layer is charged by incoming positive ions/electrons during a positive cycle of AC is applied which reduces the electric field and hinders charge transport towards the electrode. DBD also has a large surface-to-volume ratio, which promotes diffusion losses and maintains a low gas temperature. When a negative cycle of AC is applied, the electrons are repelled off of the anode, and are ready to collide with other particles. Frequencies of 1000 Hz or more are required to move the electrons fast enough to create a microplasma, but excessive frequencies can damage the electrode (~50 kHz). Although dielectric barrier discharge comes in various shapes and dimensions, each individual discharge is in micrometer scale.
Pulsed Power.
AC and radio frequency power are often used to excite dielectrics, in place of DC. Take AC as an example, there are positive and negative cycles in each period. When the positive cycle occurs, electrons accumulate on the dielectric surface. On the other hand, the negative cycle would repel the accumulated electrons, causing collisions in the gas and creating plasma. During the switch from the negative to positive cycles, the above-mentioned frequency range of 1000 Hz-50,000 Hz is needed in order for a microplasma to be generated. Because of the small mass of the electrons, they are able to absorb the sudden switch in energy and become excited; the larger particles (atoms, molecules, and ions), however aren't able to follow the fast switching, therefore keeping the gas temperature low.
Laser Induced.
With the use of lasers, solid substrates can be converted directly into microplasmas. Solid targets are struck by high energy lasers, usually gas lasers, which are pulsed at time periods from picoseconds to femtoseconds (mode-locking). Successful experiments have used Ti:Sm, KrF, and YAG lasers, which can be applied to a variety of substrates such as lithium, germanium, plastics, and glass.
History.
In 1857, Werner von Siemens, a German scientist, originated
ozone generation using a dielectric barrier discharge apparatus for biological decontamination. His observations were explained without the knowledge of “microplasmas”, but were later recognized as the first use of microplasmas to date. The early electrical engineers, such as Edison and Tesla, were actually trying to prevent the generation of such "micro-discharges", and used dielectrics to insulate the first electrical infrastructures. Subsequent studies have observed the Paschen breakdown curve as being the prime cause of microplasma generation in an article published in 1916. Subsequent articles during the course of the 20th century have described the various conditions and specifications that lead to the generation of microplasmas. After Siemens' interactions with microplasma, Ulrich Kogelschatz was the first to identify these "micro-discharges" and define their fundamental properties. Kogelschatz also realized that microplasmas could be used for excimer formation. His experiments spurred the rapid development of the microplasma field. In February 2003, Kunihide Tachibana, a professor of Kyoto University held the first international workshop on microplasmas (IWM) in Hyogo, Japan., The workshop, titled “The New World of Microplasmas”, opened a new era of microplasma research.
Tachibana is recognized as one of the founding fathers as he coined the term “microplasma”.
The Second IWM was organized in October 2004 by Professors K.H. Becker, J.G. Eden, and K.H.
Schoenbach at Steven’s Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.
The third international workshop was coordinated by the Institute of Low Temperature
Plasma Physics alongside the Institute of Physics of Ernst-Moitz-Arndt-University in
Griefswald, Germany, May 2006. Topics discussed were inspiring scientific and
arising technological opportunities of microplasmas. The fourth IWM was held
in Taiwan in October 2007, the fifth in San Diego, California in March 2009, and the sixth in Paris, France in April 2011. The next (seventh) workshop will be held in China, in approximately May 2013.
Applications.
The rapid growth of applications of microplasmas renders it impossible to name all of them within a short space, but some selected applications are listed here.
Plasma Displays.
Artificially generated microplasmas are found on the flat panel screen of a plasma display. The technology utilizes small cells and contains electrically charged ionized gases. Across this plasma display panel, there are a millions of tiny cells called pixels that are confined to form a visual image. In the plasma display panels, X and Y grid of electrodes, separated by a MgO dielectric layer and surrounded by a mixture of inert gases - such as argon, neon or xenon, the individual picture elements are addressed. They work on the principle that passing a high voltage through a low-pressure gas generates light. Essentially, a PDP can be viewed as a matrix of tiny fluorescent tubes which are controlled in a sophisticated fashion. Each pixel comprises a small capacitor with three electrodes, one for each primary color (some newer displays include an electrode for yellow). An electrical discharge across the electrodes causes the rare gases sealed in the cell to be converted to plasma form as it ionizes. Being electrically neutral, it contains equal quantities of electrons and ions and is, by definition, a good conductor. Once energized, the plasma cells release ultraviolet (UV) light which then strikes and excites red, green and blue phosphors along the face of each pixel, causing them to glow.
Illumination.
The team of Gary Eden and Sung-Jin Park are pioneering the use of microplasmas for general illumination. Their apparatus uses many microplasma generators in a large array, which emit light through a clear, transparent window. Unlike fluorescent lamps, which
require the electrodes to be far apart in a cylindrical cavity and vacuum conditions, microplasma light sources can be put into many different shapes and configurations, and generate heat. This is opposed to the more commonly used fluorescent lamps which require a noble gas atmosphere (usually argon), where eximer formation and resulting radiative decomposition strikes a phosphor coating to create light.
Excimer light sources are also being produced and researched. The stable, non-equilibrium condition of microplasmas favors three-body collisions which can lead to excimer formation. The excimer, an unstable molecule produced by collisions of excited atoms, is very short lived due to its rapid dissociation. Upon their decomposition, excimers release different kinds of radiation when electrons fall to lower energy levels. One application, which has been pursued by the Hyundai Display Advanced Technology R&D Research Center and the University of Illinois, is to use excimer light sources in flat panel displays.
Destruction of volatile organic compounds (VOC's).
Microplasma are used to destroy volatile organic compounds. For example, capillary plasma electrode (CPE) discharge was used to effectively destroy volatile organic compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, ethylene, heptane, octane, and ammonia in the surrounding air for use in advanced life support systems designed for enclosed environments. Destruction efficiencies were determined as a function of plasma energy density, initial contaminant concentration, residence time in plasma volume, reactor volume, and the number of contaminants in the gas flow stream. Complete destruction of VOC’s can be achieved in the annular reactor for specific energies of 3 J cm−3 and above. Furthermore, specific energies approaching 10 J cm−3 are required to achieve a comparable destruction efficiency in the cross-flow reactor. This indicates that optimization of the reactor geometry is a critical aspect of achieving maximum destruction efficiencies. Koutsospyros "et al." (2004, 2005) and Yin "et al." (2003) reported results regarding studies of VOC destruction using CPE plasma reactors. All compounds studied reached maximum VOC destruction efficiencies between 95% and 100%. The VOC destruction efficiency increased initially with the specific energy, but remained at values of the specific energy that are compound-dependent. A similar observation was made for the dependence of the VOC destruction efficiency on the residence time. The destruction efficiency increased with rising initial contaminant concentration. For chemically similar compounds, the maximum destruction efficiency was found to be inversely related to the ionization energy of the compound and directly related to the degree of chemical substitution. This may suggest that chemical substitution sites offer the highest plasma-induced chemical activity.
Environmental Sensors.
The small size and modest power required for microplasma devices employ a variety of environmental sensing applications and detect trace concentrations of hazardous species. Microplasmas are sensitive enough to act as detectors, which can distinguish between excessive quantities of complex molecules. C.M. Herring and his colleagues at Caviton Inc. have simulated this system by coupling a microplasma device with a commercial gas chromatography column (GC). The microplasma device is situated at the exit of the GC column, which records the relative fluorescence intensity of specific atomic and molecular dissociation fragments. This apparatus possesses the ability to detect minute concentrations of toxic and environmentally hazardous molecules. It can also detect a wide range of wavelengths and the temporal signature of chromatograms, which identifies the species of interest. For the detection of less complex species, the temporal sorting done by the GC column is not necessary since the direct observation of fluorescence produced in the microplasma is sufficient.
Ozone generation for water purification.
Microplasmas are being used for the formation of ozone from atmospheric oxygen. Ozone (O3) has been shown to be a good disinfectant and water treatment that can cause breakdown of organic and inorganic materials. Ozone is not potable
and reverts to diatomic oxygen, with a half-life of about 3 days in air room temperature (about 20 0C). In water, however, ozone has a half-life of only 20 minutes at the same temperature of 20 (0C) . Degremont Technologies (Switzerland) produces microplasma arrays for commercial and industrial production of ozone for water treatment. By passing molecular oxygen through a series of dielectric barriers, using what Degremont calls the Intelligent Gap System (IGS), an increasing concentration of ozone is produced by altering the gap size and coatings used on the electrodes farther down the
system. The ozone is then directly bubbled into the water to be made potable (suitable for
drinking). Unlike chlorine, which is still used in many water purification systems to treat
water, ozone does not remain in the water for extended periods. Because ozone decomposes with a half-life of 20 minutes in water at room temperature, there are no lasting effects that may cause harm.
Current Research.
Fuel Cells.
Microplasmas serve as energetic sources of ions and radicals, which are desirable for activating chemical reactions. Microplasmas are used as flow reactors that allow molecular gases to flow through the microplasma inducing chemical modifications by molecular decomposition. The high energy electrons of microplasmas accommodate chemical modification and reformation of liquid hydrocarbon fuels to produce fuel for fuel cells. Becker and his co-workers used a single flow-through dc-excited microplasma reactor to generate hydrogen from an atmospheric pressure mixture of ammonia and argon for use in small, portable fuel cells. Lindner and Besser experimented with reforming model hydrocarbons such as methane, methanol, and butane into hydrogen for fuel cell feed. Their novel microplasma reactor was a microhollow cathode discharge with a microfluidic channel. Mass and energy balances on these experiments revealed conversions up to nearly 50%, but the conversion of electrical power input to chemical reaction enthalpy was only on the order of 1%. Although through modeling the reforming reaction it was found that the amount of input electrical power to chemical conversion could increase by improving the device as well as the system parameters.
Nanomaterial synthesis and deposition.
The use of microplasmas is being looked into for the synthesis of complex
macromolecules, as well as the addition of functional groups to the surfaces of other
substrates. An article by Klages "et al." describes the addition of amino groups to the
surfaces of polymers after treatment with a pulsed DC discharge apparatus using
nitrogen containing gases. It was found that ammonia gas microplasmas add on an
average of 2.4 amino groups per square nanometer of a nitrocellulose membrane, and
increase the strength at which the layers of the substrate can bind. The treatment can
also provide a reactive surface for biomedicine, as amino groups are extremely electron
rich and energetic.
Mohan Sankaran has done work on the synthesis of nanoparticles using a pulsed DC discharge. His research team has found that by applying a microplasma jet to an electrolytic solution which has either a gold or silver anode is submerged produces the relevant cations. These cations can then capture electrons supplied by the microplasma
jet and results in the formation of nanoparticles. The research shows that more nanoparticles of gold and silver are shown in the solution than there are of the resulting salts
that form from the acid conducting solution.
Cosmetics.
Microplasma uses in research are being considered. The plasma skin regeneration (PSR) device consists of an ultra–high-radiofrequency generator that excites a tuned resonator and imparts energy to a flow of inert nitrogen gas within the handpiece. The plasma generated has an optical emission spectrum with peaks in the visible range (mainly indigo and violet) and near-infrared range. Nitrogen is used as the gaseous source because it is able to purge oxygen from the surface of the skin, minimizing the risk of unpredictable hot spots, charring, and scar formation. As the plasma hits the skin, energy is rapidly transferred to the skin surface, causing instantaneous heating in a controlled uniform manner, without an explosive effect on tissue or epidermal removal.
In pretreatment samples, the zone of collagen shows a dense accumulation of elastin, but in posttreatment samples, this zone contains less dense elastin with significant, interlocking new collagen. Repeated low-energy PSR treatment is an effective modality for improving dyspigmentation, smoothness, and skin laxity associated with photoaging. Histologic analysis of posttreatment samples confirms the production of new collagen and remodeling of dermal architecture. Changes consist of erythema and superficial epidermal peeling without complete removal, generally complete by 4 to 5 days.
Plasma medicine.
Dental treatments.
Scientists found that microplasmas are capable of inactivating bacteria that causes tooth decay and periodontal diseases. By directing low temperature microplasma beams at the calcified tissue structure beneath the tooth enamel coating called dentin, it severely reduces the amount of dental bacteria and in turn reduces infection. This aspect of microplasma could allow dentists to use microplasma technology to destroy bacteria in tooth cavities instead of using mechanical means. Developers claim that microplasma devices will enable dentists to effectively treat oral-borne diseases with little pain to their patients. 
Recent studies show that microplasmas can be a very effective method of controlling oral biofilms. Biofilms (also known as slime) are highly organized, three-dimensional bacterial communities. Dental plaque is a common example of oral biofilms. It is the main cause of both tooth decay and periodontal diseases such as Gingivitis and Periodontitis. At the University of Southern California, Parish Sedghizadeh, Director of the USC Center for Biofilms and Chunqi Jiang, assistant research professor in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics, work with researchers from Viterbi School of Engineering searching for new ways to fight off these bacterial infections. Sedghizadeh explained that the biofilms’ slimy matrix acts as extra protection against traditional antibiotics. However, the centers’ study confirms that biofilms cultivated in the root canal of extracted human teeth can be easily destroyed by the application of microplasma. The plasma emission microscopy obtained during each experiment suggests that the atomic oxygen produced by the microplasma is responsible for the inactivation of bacteria. Sedghizadeh then suggested that the oxygen free radicals could disrupt the biofilms cellular membrane and cause them to break down. According to their ongoing research at USC, Sedghizadeh and Jiang have found that microplasma is not harmful to surrounding healthy tissues and they are confident that microplasma technology will soon become a groundbreaking tool in the medical industry.J.K. Lee along with other scientists in this field have found that microplasma can also be used for teeth bleaching. This reactive species can effectively bleach teeth along with saline or whitening gels that consist of hydrogen peroxide. Lee and his colleagues experimented with this method, examining how microplasma along with hydrogen peroxide effects blood stained human teeth. These scientists took forty extracted single-root, blood stained human teeth and randomly divided them into two groups of twenty. Group one received 30% hydrogen peroxide activated by microplasma for thirty minutes in a pulp chamber, while group two received 30% hydrogen peroxide alone for thirty minutes in the pulp chamber and the temperature was maintained at thirty seven degrees Celsius for both groups. After the tests had been performed, they found that microplasma treatment with 30% hydrogen peroxide had a significant effect on the whiteness of the teeth in group one. Lee and his associates concluded that the application of microplasma along with hydrogen peroxide is an efficient method in the bleaching of stained teeth due to its ability to remove proteins on the surface of teeth and the increased production of hydroxide.
Wound care.
Microplasma that is sustained near room temperature can destroy bacteria, viruses, and fungi deposited on the surfaces of surgical instruments and medical devices. Researchers discovered that bacteria cannot survive in the harsh environment created by microplasmas. They consist of chemically reactive species such as hydroxyl (OH) and atomic oxygen (O) that can kill harmful bacteria through oxidation. Oxidation of the lipids and proteins that compose a cell’s membrane can lead to the breakdown of the membrane and deactivate the bacteria.
Microplasma can contact skin without harming it, making it ideal for disinfecting wounds. “Medical plasmas are said to be in the ‘Goldilocks’ range—hot enough to produce and be an effective treatment, but cold enough to leave tissues unharmed” (Larousi, Kong 1). Researchers have found that microplasmas can be applied directly to living tissues to deactivate pathogens. Scientists have also discovered that microplasmas stop bleeding without damaging healthy tissue, disinfect wounds, accelerate wound healing, and selectively kill some types of cancer cells.
At moderate doses, microplasmas can destroy pathogens. At low doses, they can accelerate the replication of cells—an important step in the wound healing process. The ability of microplasma to kill bacteria cells and accelerate the replication of healthy tissue cells is known as the “plasma kill/plasma heal” process, this led scientists to further experiment with the use of microplasmas for wound care. Preliminary tests have also demonstrated successful treatments of some types of chronic wounds.
Cancer treatments.
Since microplasmas deactivate bacteria they may have the ability to destroy cancer cells. Jean Michel Pouvesle has been working at the University of Orléans in France, in the Group for Research and Studies on Mediators of Inflammation (GREMI), experimenting with the effects of microplasma on cancer cells. Pouvesle along with other scientists has created a dielectric barrier discharge and plasma gun for cancer treatment, in which microplasma will be applied to both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This application will reveal the role of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), DNA damage, cell cycle modification, and apoptosis induction. Studies show that microplasma treatments are able to induce programmed death (apoptosis) among cancer cells—stopping the rapid reproduction of cancerous cells, with little damage to living human tissues.
GREMI performs many experiments with microplasmas in cancerology, their first experiment applies microplasma to mice tumors growing beneath the skin's surface. During this experiment, scientists found no changes or burns on the surface of the skin. After a five day microplasma treatment, the results displayed a significant decrease in the growth of U87 giloma cancer (brain tumor), compared to the control group where microplasma was not applied. GREMI performed further in vitro studies regarding U87 gliomal cancer (brian tumors) and HCT116 (colon tumor) cell lines where microplasma was applied. This microplasma treatment was proven to be an efficient method in destroying cancer cells after being applied over periods of a few tens of seconds. Further studies are being conducted on the effects of microplasma treatment in oncology; this application of microplasma will impact the medical field significantly.

Robert M. Wilson, Jr.

Robert M. Wilson, Jr. (b. April 28, 1952) was an Arkansas lawyer.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Robert M. Wilson, Jr. (Robby Wilson) was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on April 28, 1952. His father, now deceased, Bob Wilson, a World War II veteran and Air Force pilot, spent a career in building and banking and, to this day, remains active in both careers. His grandfather, Winston P. Wilson, Sr. originally from Tennessee, had been the President of Ouachita Baptist College in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, an author, an adventurer, and once ran for governor. His company is called “The Wilson Company, Inc.” and is still run by his Winston's family. Robert's great uncle, Winston P. (Wimpy) Wilson, Jr. joined the military very early, served in World War II and was instrumental in the creation of the National Guard Bureau in America. He was inducted posthumously into the Aviation Hall of Fame in 2000. In 1960, Robert’s brother, Charles Arthur Wilson, was born in Little Rock. 
Wilson attended pre-school and elementary school at the Anthony School. He then attended Forest Heights Junior High and Hall High School, graduating in 1970 (receiving no honors). During those years he attended, intermittently, boarding and military schools. In the summer of 1970, he enlisted in the Arkansas Air National Guard and attended basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Upon its successful conclusion, he then enrolled at the University of Arkansas (spring semester 1971), where he pledged Kappa Sigma Fraternity and lived in the Fraternity House. He was initiated in the fall of 1971 and received the designation of “Model Pledge”.
In June 1972, he moved to Washington, DC to work on the staff of Arkansas Senator John McClellan, where he was employed on the “Senator’s Only” elevator in the U.S. Capitol through “patronage” employment. This was during the very exciting Watergate Hearings and he met several young and promising attorneys soon to be famous, such as Fred Thompson (later Senator from Tennessee and movie star) and Hillary Rodham. There he attended American University.
In the fall of 1973, Robert returned to the University of Arkansas and graduated with a BA, majoring in political science in 1975. His academic requirements necessary for his degree was completed in August 1974, so that he could enter law school that same month. Robert began law school in August 1974, where he remained until graduation in the spring of 1977. Robert was a member of Phi Alpha Delta fraternity and served two terms as Treasurer of the Student Bar Association. In 1976, he was honorably discharged from the Arkansas Air National Guard having dutifully completed his term of enlistment. In July 1977, he unsuccessfully sat for the bar, passing it in the spring of 1978. Wilson & Associates was founded at that time.
Career.
Mr. Wilson's career spans 4 decades. Originally organized as Robert M Wilson, Jr, PA and in partnership with other Professional Associations (PA's) he practiced law in Little Rock, Arkansas, from 1978 until 1979 as a member of "Hamilton, O'Hara and Hays". Founded by Senior Partner, Mr. William P. Hamilton,jr., (Mr. Wilson's early mentor) it included the future Mayor of North Little Rock, Patrick Henry Hayes. From 1979 until 1982, the firm was called, Hamilton, Mackey, Wilson, Johnson and Wood. Becoming an established Pulaski, County Arkansas full service law firm. The partners exhibited client and bar approval on both sides of the Arkansas River in Little Rock and North Little Rock. Former Little Rock Mayor, Frank Mackey brought political depth and influence to the young firm. In 1982, the firm transitioned once again, from a full service general practice representing numerous different kinds of diverse interests to one of a limited practice with real estate and tax related matters as its focus. The firm, then called Wilson & Wood was built upon Wilson's cornerstone relationship with Union National Bank of Little Rock and David Wood's well respected tax law practice. Joining them the following year was the experienced trial lawyer, David Hargis, the trio practiced as Wilson, Wood and Hargis for three years. Foreseeing ever increasing client conflicts arising between their growing practices, the trio amiably parted ways in the fall of 1985 and Mr. Wilson, changed the name of his practice from, Robert M Wilson Jr PA to Wilson & Associates PLLC and so it has remained through the current time.
1n 2008, Mr. Wilson left the full time daily practice of law but has remained in active temporary practice with his firms.
Wilson History & Research Center.
In January 2008, Mr. Wilson founded the Wilson History and Research Center, a non-profit lending institution dedicated to locating, acquiring, authenticating and disseminating headgear of the 20th Century. Launching this virtual museum allowed Wilson to concentrate his energy on developing the underlying core relationships which will take the Sec. 501(c)3 not for profit foundation forward as a principal center for research and study regarding the development of military headgear of all nations in the 20th century. The vision of the foundation and indeed of Wilson himself is that the Center will reach out to every person interested in these specific studies. The virtual museum acquires examples of the nearly 10 million unique pieces which were designed, approved and manufactured, by direct purchase, charitable gift or consent of the owner to publish their gallery within the structure of the web site. As of January 2013, after Robby's death, the museum is unfortunately in the process of closing its doors. Robby's goal of collecting and disseminating 10 million unique pieces was not achieved. 
Gift of Piper.
On May 24, 2009, Wilson donated a completely restored Piper L-3 Grasshopper, spotter plane to the renowned D-Day Museum, dedicated to the paratroopers of the US, Musee-Airborne in St. Marie Eglise, Normandy, France. Captivated a year earlier by the description of this venerated museum's charter, by Patrick Brunel, the Museum's Curator, Wilson, embarked upon a personal quest to locate not only an authentic Piper Cub, but one whose serial number would indicate that the plane could easily have been involved in the invasion of Europe. Luck being on his side, Wilson soon found and acquired a perfect example in Saarbruken, German and acquired it from Herr, Bernard Gross, its owner. The gift was a part of the 65th D-Day remembrance and in most part was in Wilson's words, an "attempt to honor the memory of those who gave so much so that we may have our freedom."
XRF Technology.
In addition to the many activities that WHRC is involved the organization was instrumental in the endorsement of X-Ray Fluorescence technology into the world of collecting steel helmets. The process pioneered by David May of Florida helps point to authentic versus counterfeit military helmets. it is estimated that nearly one out of every five collectable helmets sold were reproductions sold as authentic. Bringing the light of science upon this dark practice, it is hoped, will clear the false and fraudulent pieces from the archives of the world and bring relative confidence that what is being offered by enthusiasts and museums alike are real and authentic.
Children.
Robert Wilson has two children, Robert M. Wilson, III, born in 1987, and Jillian Herrick Wilson, born in 1989. Robert is in his first year of law school at the University of Arkansas.
Philanthropy.
Mr. Wilson has always felt that active participation in the development of social and professional responsibility is the concomitant obligation of the benefit of education, professional development and personal stability. His theory of giving back to any organization or institution "more than it gives to you" is the cornerstone of his philanthropy.
Jazz - Beginning as a DJ at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, in 1973, Wilson has been a life long advocate of increasing the understanding and enjoyment in this musical art form. Working with premier Jazz drummer Dave Rogers, in Little Rock, Wilson funded 16 years of developmental extemporaneous jazz performances. The Monday Night Jazz Project at the afterthought, brought hundreds of musicians together in Little Rock and became the fundamental measure for a young musician stepping up into the role of Jazzman. Wilson received the 2010 Jazzman of the Year award for his efforts from the Arkansas Jazz Heritage Foundation. The 16 year project came to an end in May 2011.
Cancer - In March 2010 Wilson was diagnosed with terminal esophageal cancer. After treatment at the Winthrop P Rockefeller Cancer Treatment Center at the University of Arkansas Medical School in Little Rock he was found in January 2010 to be cancer free. He was named as one of the Faces of Cancer for 2011 by the American Cancer Society and has participated in continuing the development of growing awareness of this illness. In April, 2011 additional cancer was found and surgically removed. Wilson devoted a large percentage of his last days to Cancer Awareness and recovery and the hope that Cancer could be cured.

Radio Skid Row

Radio Skid Row (callsign 2RSR) is a community radio station based in Marrickville, broadcasting to the Inner West suburbs of Sydney. This includes the municipalities of Leichhardt, Marrickville and the City of Sydney. 
Radio Skid Row has built a reputation for development and training projects with minority communities and has been pivotal in allowing disadvantaged communities to participate in community broadcasting. It was home to the original "Radio Redfern" and later Koori Radio which now has its own citywide licence. It was also the station where Muslim radio started in Sydney.
History.
Radio Skid Row began as a landline operation available in "Community Youth Support Scheme Centres", Long Bay Gaol and local drop-in centres. The station secured a community radio licence in 1983 to broadcast to the inner-city areas of Sydney. 
Initially the plans for the station was that it would play commercial music and would broadcast relevant information that homeless people needed, such as accommodation availability and where to obtain free meals.
Tensions emerged during the first year of operations at the station, sparked by a management style that limited volunteer involvement in the structures and operation of the station, thereby going against the principles of community broadcasting.
In June 1984 the management tried to close the station down and lock out the volunteers and community program makers. The station was off the air for three weeks and when it reopened was only on air for twelve hours a day. Station workers then took the opportunity to overturn the Board of directors at an Annual General Meeting, which happened shortly after the lockout. The station then set about reforming itself based on a cooperative model, in a style similar to that of 4ZZZ.
Current.
The station’s mission is to provide a voice for youth, community groups and in languages other than English. It is particularly active in working with marginalized members of the community.
Programming.
Radio Skid Row plays a mix of black music which includes reggae, African, indigenous, hip hop, RnB, music from the Pacific Islands and from around the world. It also specialises in talk programs presented from a radical viewpoint.

Ironwood Springs Christian Ranch

Ironwood Springs Christian Ranch (ISCR) is a Christian camp in southern Minnesota serving over 22,000 people per year. Founded by Bob Bardwell, ISCR's express purpose is to provide an atmosphere and opportunity for adults and children to get to know themselves, others and God better. Ironwood Springs has been a non-profit organization since 1976. The camp gets its name from the hundreds of Ironwood trees on the land and the boiling springs along the Root River.
History.
Since 1969, Bob Bardwell (wheelchair marathon racer and author) had a dream to start or work at a Christian camp when he worked at Horn Creek Ranch in Westcliffe, Colorado. God used Bob's experiences at this camp to show him the spiritual, social, and emotional impact a Christian camp can have on a child for lifetime. After leaving Horn Creek Ranch, it was Bardwell's goal to start a Christian camp of his own.
In 1973, Bardwell finished seminary and got married. That same year he was paralyzed from the waist down in a heavy construction accident. This event led to a series of changes that allowed Bob to see the Lord's purpose and plan for his life. By 1976, land that Bob's father, Lester Bardwell, had purchased was transformed into the start of a non-profit, non-denominational, independent Christian camp. "Bob's dream was realized."

Porodična Manufaktura Crnog Hleba

Porodična Manufaktura Crnog Hleba (Serbian Cyrillic: Породична Мануфактура Црног Хлеба; trans. "Rye Bread Family Manufacture") were a former Yugoslav acoustic rock band and a theatre group. They were one of the pioneers of the former Yugoslav acoustic rock scene.
Band history.
The band was formed in 1968 by Maja de Rado (songwriter, vocals and twelve string guitar), Jugoslav Vlahović (acoustic guitar) and Slobodan Kuzmanović (acoustic guitar). Being close relatives, they named the band Porodična Manufaktura Crnog Hleba. At the beginning of 1969, they were joined by Petar Pavišić (double bass). The band worked with several flutists: Vlada Bogosavljević, Sreten Tasić and Branko Malkoč. The band held happenings in the basement of Atelje 212 theatre, and during 1972 and 1973 performed alternative play "Porodična manufaktura crnog hleba - balada Maje de Rado" ("Rye Bread Family Manufacture - A Ballad by Maja de Rado"), during which they performed their music.
In 1974 they released their debut album "Stvaranje" ("The Creation"). Following the release of "Stvaranje" they started performing a play with the same name at Atelje 212 during which they played photographic slides and short films. The painter Dobrivoje Petrović performed with the band, playing sitar. At the time of recording of their second studio album, Porodična Manufaktura Crnog Hleba disbanded due to the male members' army obligations.
Post breakup.
After the breakup Maja de Rado dedicated herself to classical music and meditation poetry and Vlahović started working as a designer and cartoonist.
In 1994, the band's song "Nešto" ("Something") was released on Komuna compilation album "" ("We Could Have Done All: Acoustic Music"), which featured songs by Yugoslav acoustic rock acts.
Slobodan Kuzmanović died on January 26, 2014. He was 61 years old.

Synthetic CDO

A Synthetic CDO (collateralized debt obligation) is a variation of a CDO that generally uses credit default swaps and other derivatives to obtain its investment goals. As such, it is a complex derivative financial security sometimes described as a bet on the performance of other mortgage (or other) products, rather than a real mortgage security. The value and payment stream of a synthetic CDO is derived not from cash assets, like mortgages or credit card payments — as in the case of a regular or "cash" CDO — but from premiums paying for credit default swap "insurance" on the possibility that some defined set of "reference" securities — based on cash assets — will default. The insurance-buying "counterparties" may own the "reference" securities and be managing the risk of their default, or may be speculators who've calculated that the securities will default.
Synthetics thrived for a brief time because they were cheaper and easier to create than traditional CDOs, whose raw material, mortgages, was beginning to dry up.
In 2005 the synthetic CDO market in corporate bonds spread to the mortgage-backed securities market, where the counterparties providing the payment stream were primarily hedge funds or investment banks hedging, or often betting that certain debt the synthetic CDO referenced — usually "tranches" of subprime home mortgages — would default. Synthetic issuance jumped from $15 billion in 2005 to $61 billion in 2006, when synthetics became the dominant form of CDO's in the US, valued "notionally" at $5 trillion by the end of the year according to one estimate.
Synthetic CDO's have been criticized as serving as a way of hiding short position of bets against the subprime mortgages from unsuspecting triple-A seeking investors, and contributing to the 2007-2009 financial crisis by amplifying the subprime mortgage housing bubble. By 2012 the total notional value of synthetics had been reduced to a couple of billion.
History.
In 1997, the Broad Index Secured Trust Offering (BISTRO) was introduced. It has been called the predecessor to the synthetic CDO structure. From 2005 through 2007, at least $108 billion Synthetic CDOs were issued, according to the financial data firm Dealogic. The actual volume was much higher because synthetic CDO trades are unregulated and "often not reported to any financial exchange or market". Journalist Gregory Zuckerman, states that "according to some estimates", while there "were $1.2 trillion of subprime loans" in 2006, "more than $5 trillion of investments", i.e. synthetic CDOs, were created based on these loans. 
Some of the major creators of Synthetic CDOs who also took short positions in the securities were Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Tricadia Inc. In 2012 the total notional value of Synthetic CDOs was only about $2 billion.
Definition.
A synthetic CDO is typically negotiated between two or more counterparties that have different viewpoints about what will ultimately happen with respect to the underlying reference securities. In this regard, a synthetic CDO requires investors on both sides—those taking a long position and those taking a short position. Various financial intermediaries, such as investment banks and hedge funds, may be involved in selecting the reference securities to be wagered upon and finding the counterparties. Complex legal entities such as structured investment vehicles may be created to facilitate and administer the deal. One counterparty typically pays a premium to another counterparty in exchange for a large payment if certain events related to the reference securities occur, similar to an insurance arrangement. It represents a leveraged bet, meaning it may result in a potentially large payout without requiring that a large amount of funds (collateral) be set aside. These securities are not typically traded on stock exchanges.
In technical terms, the synthetic CDO is a form of collateralized debt obligation (CDO) in which the underlying credit exposures are taken on using a credit default swap rather than by having a vehicle buy assets such as bonds. Synthetic CDOs can either be single tranche CDOs or fully distributed CDOs. Synthetic CDOs are also commonly divided into balance sheet and arbitrage CDOs, although it is often impossible to distinguish in practice between the two types. They generate income selling insurance against bond defaults in the form of credit default swaps, typically on a pool of 100 or more companies. Sellers of credit default swaps receive regular payments from the buyers, which are usually banks or hedge funds.
Synthetic CDOs are highly controversial, because of their role in the subprime mortgage crisis. They enabled large wagers to be made on the value of mortgage-related securities, which critics argued may have contributed to lower lending standards and fraud.
Parties.
Investors in synthetic CDOs included 
One example is Abacus 2004-1, the first of 47 synthetic CDOs Goldman Sachs packaged and sold. The deal was worth $2 billion. About one-third of the swaps referenced residential mortgage-backed securities, another third referenced existing CDOs, and the rest, commercial mortgage–backed securities (made up of bundled commercial real estate loans) and other securities.
The short investor for the entire deal -- "betting it would fail" -- was Goldman, which purchased credit default swap protection on the reference securities and paid premiums.
The funded investors of that CDO were IKB (a German bank), the TCW Group, and Wachovia. These firms put up a total of $195 million to purchase "mezzanine" tranches of the deal (rated 'AA' to 'BB') and in return would receive scheduled principal and interest payments if the referenced assets performed. If those assets did not, Goldman would receive the $195 million. In this sense, IKB, TCW, and Wachovia were “long” investors, betting that the referenced assets would perform well. 
The unfunded investors—TCW and GSC Partners (asset management firms that managed both hedge funds and CDOs)—did not put up any money up front; they received annual premiums from Goldman via the CDO in return for the promise that they would pay the CDO if the reference securities failed and the CDO did not have enough funds to pay the short investors. (As of 2011, Goldman, the CDO creator and short investor has received about $930 million, while the long investors lost "just about all of their investments".)
Characteristics.
Synthetic CDOs were easier, and thus faster and cheaper to create than traditional CDOs, because there were no mortgage assets to collect and finance. Creating synthetic CDOs took a fraction of the time of a cash CDO.
A synthetic CDO is a portfolio of credit default swaps (CDS). Each CDS is a form of insurance on a bond or other obligation (the "reference security"). The CDS seller provides protection (insurance) in the event of a default or specified "credit event" related to the reference security. The CDS buyer pays a premium in exchange for this protection. In some cases, this represents a hedge, meaning the buyer actually owns the reference security they are insuring so losses on one or the other offset. In other cases, the bet is purely speculative, meaning a debt security not owned could be the reference security involved in the bet.
"CDS Example: Party A might own certain bonds of Company B. Concerned that Company B might default (i.e., fail to pay interest or principal) on its bonds, Party A can buy protection from Party C, paying a premium to Party C. In the event Company B defaults, Party C pays Party A whatever amount has been agreed between them. This arrangement is a credit default swap and represents a hedge. Party A does not have to own the bonds of Company B to enter into this arrangement; this would be a speculative or "naked" CDS."
The problem with buying a CDS is that it usually references only "one" security, and the credit risk to be transferred in the swap may be very, very large. In contrast, a synthetic CDO references a portfolio of securities and is itself securitized into notes in various tranches, with progressively higher levels of risk. In turn, synthetic CDOs give buyers the flexibility to take on only as much credit risk as they wish to assume.
The seller of the synthetic CDO gets premiums for the component CDS and is taking the "long" position, meaning they are betting the referenced securities (such as mortgage bonds or regular CDOs) will perform. The buyers of the component CDS are paying premiums and taking the "short" position, meaning they are betting the referenced securities will default. The buyer receives a large payout if the referenced securities default, which is paid to them by the seller. The buyers of the synthetic CDO are taking a long position in the component CDS pool, as if the referenced securities default the seller of the synthetic CDO must pay out to the buyers of the component CDS rather than the buyers of the synthetic CDO.
The term synthetic CDO arises because the cash flows from the premiums (via the component CDS in the portfolio) are analogous to the cash flows arising from mortgage or other obligations that are aggregated and paid to regular CDO buyers. In other words, taking the long position on a synthetic CDO (i.e., receiving regular premium payments) is like taking the long position on a normal CDO (i.e., receiving regular interest payments on mortgage bonds or credit card bonds contained within the CDO).
In the event of default, those in the long position on either CDO or synthetic CDO suffer large losses. With the synthetic CDO, the long investor pays the short investor, versus the normal CDO in which the interest payments decline or stop flowing to the long investor.
"Synthetic CDO Example: Party A wants to bet that at least some mortgage bonds and CDOs will default from among a specified population of such securities, taking the short position. Party B can bundle CDS related to these securities into a synthetic CDO contract. Party C agrees to take the long position, agreeing to pay Party A if certain defaults or other credit events occur within that population. Party A pays Party C premiums for this protection. Party B, typically an investment bank, would take a fee for arranging the deal."
One investment bank described a synthetic CDO as having 
"characteristics much like that of a futures contract, requiring two counterparties to take different views on the forward direction of a market or particular financial product, one short and one long. A CDO is a debt security collateralized by debt obligations, including mortgage-backed securities in many instances. These securities are packaged and held by a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which issues notes that entitle their holders to payments derived from the underlying assets. In a synthetic CDO, the SPV does not own the portfolio of actual fixed income assets that govern the investors’ rights to payment, but rather enters into CDSs that reference the performance of a portfolio. The SPV does hold some separate collateral securities which it uses to meet its payment obligations."
Another interesting characteristic of synthetic CDOs is that they are "not" usually fully funded like money market funds or other conventional investments. In other words, a synthetic CDO covering $1 billion of credit risk will "not" actually sell $1 billion in notes, but will raise some smaller amount. That is, only the highest-rated tranches are fully funded and the more risky tranches are not.
In the event of default on "all" the underlying obligations, the premiums paid by Party A to Party C in the above example would be paid back to Party A until exhausted. The next question is who actually pays for the remaining credit risk on the more risky tranches, as well as the "super-senior" risk that was never structured into tranches at all (because it was thought that no properly structured synthetic CDO would actually undergo complete default). In reality, many banks simply kept the super-senior risk on their own books or insured it through severely undercapitalized "monoline" bond insurers. In turn, the growing mountains of super-senior risk caused major problems during the subprime mortgage crisis.
Impact on the subprime mortgage crisis.
According to "New York Times" business journalist Joe Nocera, synthetic expanded the impact of non-prime mortgage defaults. Prior to the creation of CDS and synthetic CDOs, you could have only as much exposure to non-prime mortgage bonds as there were such mortgage bonds in existence. At their peak, approximately $1 trillion in subprime and Alt-A mortgages were securitized by Wall Street. However, with the introduction of the CDS and synthetic CDO, exposure could be amplified, since mortgage bonds could be "referenced" by an infinite number of synthetic CDOs, as long as investors agreed to take the other side of the bet. For example the "Financial Crisis Inquiry Report" found that more than $50 million worth of credit default swaps in Synthetic CDOs referencing only $12 million in the low rated BBB tranche of the one mortgage-backed security — "CMLTI 2006-NC2" — it followed. This was just one of many low rated tranches that was referenced by several CDW and later defaulted.
Synthetic CDO’s were both "cheaper and easier" to create, easier to customize, taking a fraction of the time and a replacement for increasingly scarce regular CDOs. In 2006-2007 — as interest rates rose and home prices became increasingly unaffordable — subprime mortgage origination starting to run out of risky borrowers to make questionable home loans to, at the same time the number of hedge funds and investment banks interested in betting with CDS (a raw material of synthetic CDOs) against repayment of the bad home loans grew.
Debate and criticism.
Synthetic CDO's have been strongly criticized for making the Subprime mortgage crisis worse than it already was — or as journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera put it — turning a "keg of dynamite" that was subprime loans "into the financial equivalent of a nuclear bomb". Zuckerman calls the growth of synthetics, "the secret to why debilitating losses resulted from a market that seemed small to most outsiders".
Economist Paul Krugman and financier George Soros have called for their banning. Krugman wrote in April 2010 that: "What we can say is that the final draft of financial reform ... should block the creation of 'synthetic CDOs,' cocktails of credit default swaps that let investors take big bets on assets without actually owning them." Financier George Soros said in June 2009: "CDS are instruments of destruction which ought to be outlawed."
Author Roger Lowenstein wrote in April 2010: "...the collateralized debt obligations ... sponsored by most every Wall Street firm ... were simply a side bet — like those in a casino — that allowed speculators to increase society’s mortgage wager without financing a single house ... even when these instruments are used by banks to hedge against potential defaults, they raise a moral hazard. Banks are less likely to scrutinize mortgages and other loans they make if they know they can reduce risk using swaps. The very ease with which derivatives allow each party to 'transfer' risk means that no one party worries as much about its own risk. But, irrespective of who is holding the hot potato when the music stops, the net result is a society with more risk overall." He argued that speculative CDS should be banned and that more capital should be set aside by institutions to support their derivative activity.
Columnist Robert Samuelson wrote in April 2010 that the culture of investment banks has shifted from a focus on the most productive allocation of savings, to a focus on maximizing profit through proprietary trading and arranging casino-like wagers for market participants: "If buyers and sellers can be found, we'll create and trade almost anything, no matter how dubious. Precisely this mind-set justified the packaging of reckless and fraudulent "subprime" mortgages into securities. Hardly anyone examined the worth of the underlying loans."
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker has argued that banks should not be allowed to trade on their own accounts, essentially separating proprietary trading and financial intermediation entirely in separate firms, as opposed to separate divisions within firms. His recommendation -- the Volcker Rule -- would apply to synthetic securitization
Specific issues.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission noted that while the credit default swaps used in synthetics were often compared to insurance, unlike insurance policies in the US they were not regulated. That meant that a party with no "insurable interest" could buy a credit default swap as a pure bet (known as “naked credit default swaps”) -- forbidden with insurance. This allowed inflation of potential losses or gains on the default of a loan or institution. Insurance regulators also 
required that 
insurers put aside reserves in case of a loss. In the housing boom, CDS were sold by firms that failed to put up any reserves or initial collateral or to hedge their exposure. In the run-up to the crisis, AIG, the largest U.S. insurance company, would accumulate a one-half trillion dollar position in credit risk through the OTC market without being required to post one dollar’s worth of initial collateral or making any other provision for loss. 
The CDOs have also been described as serving as a way of hiding short position of bets against the subprime mortgages from investors who depended on credit rating agency ratings to judge risk. In the case of the "Synthetic CDO Example" above, there were a number of "Party Cs" who bought synthetic CDOs from investment banks, not because they had examined the referenced securities and thought a long position was prudent, but because they trusted the credit agency rating the investment bank had paid for. The investors were unaware that the investment bank had created the synthetic CDO because they—or a favored client such as Paulson & Co.—wanted to bet on the default of the referenced securities, and needed the investor to pay them off if they won. The "New York Times" quoted one expert as saying: 
“The simultaneous selling of securities to customers and shorting them because they believed they were going to default is the most cynical use of credit information that I have ever seen...When you buy protection against an event that you have a hand in causing, you are buying fire insurance on someone else’s house and then committing arson.”
One bank spokesman said that synthetic CDO created by Wall Street were made to satisfy client demand for such products, which the clients thought would produce profits because they had an optimistic view of the housing market.
The crisis has renewed debate regarding the duty of financial intermediaries or market-makers such as investment banks to their clients. Intermediaries frequently take long or short positions on securities. They will often assume the opposite side of a client’s position to complete a transaction. The intermediary may hold or sell that position to increase, reduce or eliminate its own exposures. It is also typical that those clients taking the long or short positions do not know the identity of the other. The role of the intermediary is widely understood by the sophisticated investors that typically enter into complex transactions like synthetic CDO.
However, when an intermediary is trading on its own account and not merely hedging financial exposures created in its market-maker role, potential conflicts of interest arise. For example, if an investment bank has a significant bet that a particular asset class will decline in value and has taken the short position, does it have a duty to reveal the nature of these bets to clients who are considering taking the long side of the bet? To what extent does a market-maker that also trades on its own account owe a fiduciary responsibility to its customers, if any?

D. G. Hessayon

David Gerald Hessayon (born 1928) is a British author and botanist of Cypriot descent who is known for a best-selling series of gardening manuals known as the "Expert Guides" under his title Dr. D. G. Hessayon. The series started in 1958 with "Be Your Own Gardening Expert" and in 2008 the celebrated their 50th anniversary and the 50 millionth copy in print. They have become the best selling gardening books in history.
Early life.
Hessayon is the son of a Cypriot landowner and grew up in Salford, England. He gained a Bachelor of Science degree in botany from Leeds University. In 1950, he travelled to the United States where he worked as the editor of a small town newspaper. In 1953, he went to Ghana as a Research Fellow at the University College before returning to Manchester to obtain his doctorate in soil ecology. In 1955, he accepted a position as chief scientist with Pan Britannica Industries Ltd(PBI), becoming chairman in 1972. It was here Dr. Hessayon formulated the idea for his "Expert" guides to gardening.
The "Expert" guides.
A steady stream of publications followed the initial "Be Your Own Gardening Expert", each maintaining the basic formula of down-to-earth writing with pictures, charts, and photographs. On the British bestsellers list for the 1980s, two Experts were in the Top 10. There are () over 20 "Expert" titles in 22 languages and in Britain their sales continue to dominate the gardening paperback lists. "The Vegetable & Herb Expert" continues to be the best seller.
Recognition.
In 1993, he received the first-ever Lifetime Achievement award at the British Book Awards. He was also awarded The Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society for his contribution to the advancement and improvement of the science and practice of horticulture. In 1999, he was awarded a Guinness World Records certificate for being Britain’s "bestselling non-fiction author of the 1990s".
Despite a resolve to stay out of the limelight, he has received further awards- a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Garden Media Guild, three honorary doctorates and, in 2007, an OBE. In 2012 he was included in the "Daily Mail" list of "60 truly great Elizabethans" for "teaching millions of us how to garden".

Edward Northey (British Army officer)

Major-General Sir Edward Northey, GCMG, CB (May 1868 – December 1953) was a senior British Army officer of the First World War who commanded a brigade on the Western Front until wounded in 1915. Returning to service in 1916, Northey took command of a colonial force in Nyasaland in the East African Campaign, later becoming Governor of Kenya. He later served as a general of Territorial forces and retired in 1926.
Birth and early career.
Edward Northey was born in 1868 and educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, being commissioned into the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1888. He served in expeditions to Hazara and the Miranzai Valley in 1891 and one to Isazai the following year. In 1899, Northey took part in the Second Boer War, remaining in the theatre until 1902.
First World War.
When the First World War broke out in 1914, Northey was a lieutenant colonel in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and served with the regiment on the Western Front during the first year of the war. In March 1915, Northey was promoted to brigadier-general and took over the 15th Infantry Brigade but was seriously wounded during the Second Battle of Ypres. The date is unclear, but Northey was reportedly surveying the site of a new communication trench when he was struck in the thigh by shrapnel.
Returning to the army in 1916 after recovering from his wound, Northey was posted to Nyasaland in command of the Nyasa-Rhodesia Field Force, operating against Lettow-Vorbeck's indigenous and German forces in the East African Campaign.
Northey was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1917 and was knighted in the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918 for his war service, the same year he was promoted to major-general. He later advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.
Post-war career.
At the war's end Northey was appointed Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, which became known as Kenya in 1920.
On 16 October 1919 "The Times" newspaper reported that Sir Edward Northey had met with an accident, while playing polo, which required the removal of his right eye. The accident occurred in British East Africa. 
In 1922, Northey became High Commissioner of Zanzibar, returning to Britain in 1924 to return to military service.
On his return, Northey was placed in command of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army formation. This responsibility was shared with command of the South West Area of Britain, and Northey performed well at both duties until his retirement from military service in 1926. Northey died in 1953 after a peaceful retirement.

Matsudaira Harusato

Early life.
Harusato was born at the Matsudaira residence in Edo (present-day Tokyo) in 1751, the second son of Matsudaira Munenobu, who then ruled Matsue.
Headship.
Harusato succeeded his father, Munenobu, as lord of the Izumo Matsue fief when his father, the 6th-generation lord of the fief, retired in the 6th year of the Meiwa era (1769). By then, due largely to contributions ordered by the bakufu for the repair of Enryaku-ji temple, the fief had been reduced to a state of poverty. With the support of his chief retainer, Asahi Tamba, Harusato set about reversing the situation quickly by increasing production of the fief's major products and making the rice paddy area of the fief more secure by the promotion of flood control. These efforts met with success, and the Izumo Matsue fief was among the fastest to accomplish reform.
Fumai as Tea Master.
In terms of the history of chanoyu, with the advent of the Tokugawa period in 1615, the fashion of samurai personally practicing chanoyu lost its attraction; chanoyu lost its function as a focal point for political ties among the samurai. From about the middle of the 18th century, however, the old-guard samurai who had scorned chanoyu as the idle game of indolent men of leisure had died. By this time, many of the new generation of daimyō were rising as leaders in the development of urban culture. Matsudaira Harusato was outstanding among them.
As he was early into his mission of restoring the finances and government of his fief, Harusato in 1770 wrote a treatise titled "Mudagoto" words, apparently in opposition to his main retainer Asahi Tamba who criticized him for use of fief funds toward chanoyu. In the "Mudagoto", Harusato states: "Making chanoyu a luxury, exhausting beauty to make it splendid is a distressful thing. . . . rather, it can be made an adjutant to governing the country well."
His chanoyu mentor was Isa Kōtaku (1684-1745), a disciple of the Rinzai Zen monk Ikei Sōetsu (253rd abbot of Daitokuji temple, Kyoto, and later, founder of Kōgen'in temple in Edo ), who was in turn a disciple of the daimyō and chanoyu master Katagiri Sadamasa Sekishū (1605–73). He was also privy to a copy of the "Nanpōroku" (南方録)　record of the chanoyu teachings of Sen Rikyū, from Arai Itsushō (1726-1804), who was a tea devotee in Edo in the chanoyu tradition of Hosokawa Tadaoki (a.k.a. Hosokawa Sansai).

Jane Harris (writer)

Jane Harris (born 1961) is a British writer of fiction and screenplays. Her most recent work is the critically acclaimed "Gillespie and I". Her first novel, "The Observations", was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction 2007. Waterstone's, the UK bookstore chain, has chosen her as one of its 25 Authors for the Future.
Early life and career.
Harris was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and spent her early childhood there before her parents moved in 1965 to Glasgow, Scotland. On leaving school she studied English Literature and Drama at the University of Glasgow, then trained as an actress at the East 15 Acting School in London.
After a few years of trying different careers she worked abroad, variously as a dishwasher, a waitress, a chambermaid and an English language teacher. She began writing short stories during this period, while confined to bed in Portugal with a bout of flu.
On her return to Glasgow several of her short stories were published in anthologies. In the early 1990s she was a regular panellist on STV's "Scottish Books" programme.
She went on to study for the MA in Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia under Malcolm Bradbury. After gaining a distinction in her degree she completed a PhD at the same university.
After UEA came a two-year stint as the Arts Council Writer-in-Residence at HMP Durham (1992–4). Following this Harris worked as a script and novel reader for film companies and for The Literary Consultancy, and as a script editor. She also taught Creative Writing for many years, principally at the University of East Anglia.
Harris lives in East London and is married to the film and TV director Tom Shankland.
Themes in writing.
"The Observations" was acclaimed for the playful and compelling voice of its narrator, Bessy Buckley, and for its humorous treatment of dark themes.
Reviews of her second novel, "Gillespie and I", have remarked upon its themes of obsession and loneliness.
Harris's work is also notable for dealing with characters on the edge of society. Other common issues in her work centre on family, immigration, exile, national identity, (particularly Scottish and Irish), crime, prostitution, madness, poverty, sexuality, gender roles and hypocrisy.
Short stories.
Her short stories have received a number of prizes including the Penguin/Observer Newspaper Short Story Award, 1993. She was awarded an Arts Council Writer's grant in 2000.
Harris has been published in a wide variety of anthologies and literary magazines including "New Writing 3", edited by Andrew Motion and Candice Rodd, and in several volumes of "New Writing Scotland".
"Ascension 1979" was commissioned for BBC Radio 3's "The Verb". Jane read the story when it was broadcast live from Radio Theatre at BBC Broadcasting House on 6 May 2011.
Screenplays.
Harris has written a number of award-winning short films, culminating in 2000 when "Bait" (funded by Film Four) was BAFTA nominated. The film won the Kodak Award and Best Short at the Newport Film Festival in the US.
In 2001, "Going Down" (funded by Working Title) was also nominated for a BAFTA and won prizes for Best Drama at the BBC Short Film Festival, Best Short at the Angers Film Festival and was runner-up in the Turner Classic Movie Awards.
Harris was shortlisted in 1999 and 2000 for the BBC's Dennis Potter Awards.
"Gillespie and I" (2011).
Harris's second novel, "Gillespie and I", was published to critical acclaim in the UK in January 2011. It is a chilling tale, largely set in the late 19th century, and involving anonymous letters, sleazy journalism and a notorious court case.
"It would appear that I am to be the first to write a book on Gillespie. Who, if not me, was dealt that hand?"
As she sits in her Bloomsbury home, with her two birds for company, elderly Harriet Baxter sets out to relate the story of her acquaintance, over four decades previously, with Ned Gillespie, a talented artist who never achieved the fame that she maintains he deserved.
Back in 1888, the young, art-loving Harriet arrives in Glasgow at the time of the International Exhibition. After a chance encounter, she befriends the Gillespie family and soon becomes a fixture in all of their lives. But when tragedy strikes – leading to a notorious criminal trial – the promise and certainties of this world all too rapidly disintegrate into mystery and deception.
Featuring a memorable cast of characters, infused with atmosphere and period detail, and shot through with wicked humour, Gillespie and I is a powerful and haunting second novel from one of today's most striking new voices.
Text taken from the hardback edition of Gillespie and I
Daisy Goodwin in the Sunday Times has described it as, ""Like a Hitchcock film, every detail is there for a reason. . . It is rare to read a literary novel where the storytelling is as skilful as the writing is fine, but in Gillespie and I, Harris has pulled off the only too rare double whammy – a Booker-worthy novel that I want to read again.""
"The Observations" (2006).
Harris's acclaimed debut, set in Scotland in 1863, is narrated by the lively, sharp Bessy Buckley, who leaves Glasgow and happens into a job as a maid at Castle Haivers.
Arabella, her mistress, encourages Bessy to write her thoughts and experiences in a journal. She also subjects Bessy to odd experiments, but Bessy goes along with them because she is flattered by the attention and quickly grows attached to her mistress.
Things change when Bessy snoops in Arabella's locked desk and discovers the book Arabella has been writing, "The Observations", a study of the "habits and nature of the Domestic Class."
Bessy is incensed to read criticisms of herself in the account, and also learns of Arabella's affection for one of her predecessors, a girl who died under mysterious circumstances.
Bessy concocts a revenge that ends up having consequences far more lasting than she ever envisioned …
"The Observations" is published in the UK by Faber and Faber, in the US by Penguin, and in Australia/New Zealand by Allen & Unwin. Since its release in the UK and US it has been published in the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Germany, Norway, Poland, France, Portugal, Sweden and Brazil. It is due to be published in Israel, Serbia and Montenegro, Romania, Croatia, Russia, Turkey.. An audiobook version is available, narrated by the author. There is also a Danish audiobook version.
Radio.
"Ascension 1979", a specially commissioned short story, was read by Harris live on BBC Radio 3's "The Verb" in May 2011.
Jane Harris talks to Jane Garvey on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in May 2011.
"The Observations" was adapted by Chris Dolan and dramatised on BBC Radio 4 "Woman's Hour" in April 2007.

Mineshaft (magazine)

Mineshaft is an independent international art magazine launched in 1999 by Everett Rand and Gioia Palmieri in Guilford, Vermont. Initially focusing on poetry and literature, the magazine began to publish comics after Robert Crumb became a contributor in 2000. The newsblog at "The Guardian" refers to "Mineshaft"'s website as a source to find out more about Crumb's latest work.
History.
"Mineshaft" was the idea of Everett Rand who was inspired by his friendship and correspondence with Irving Stettner, who published the legendary underground magazine, "Stroker", which featured contributions from Henry Miller and Paul Bowles. The name for the magazine came from Rand's favorite bar in La Paz, Bolivia where he and co-editor, Gioia Palmieri, lived in the early 1990s. 
The first issue featured a drawing by Stettner. After issue #4, Rand wrote to Robert Crumb who responded by sending a packet of sketchbook drawings. After issue #5, Crumb designed logos for the magazine which "Mineshaft" has been using ever since. Crumb's regular contributions include ten front covers, twelve back covers and a total to date of 171 pages of artwork and letters. After living and publishing "Mineshaft" in Vermont and West Virginia, the editors, Rand and Palmieri, moved their operations to Durham, North Carolina. 
The magazine currently publishes new or previously unpublished material from some of the major artists of the underground comix movement, as well as other items which include poetry, photography and short essays. Since 2009, "Mineshaft" has been serializing "Excerpts from R. Crumb's Dream Diary" by Robert Crumb.
Awards.
In June, 2009, "Mineshaft" #23 and Jay Lynch were nominated under the category "Best Cover Artist" for a Harvey Award 2009.

Post followed Elizabeth, who retired in 1995, as director and spokesperson of the Emily Post Institute. Today Peggy is author of more than twelve books including the 17th edition of Emily Post’s Etiquette. All books are published by HarperCollins. Peggy writes columns for different magazines like Good Housekeeping, Parents and USA Weekend. She is known as expert for wedding etiquette and publishes her advice in InStyle Weddings, WeddingChannel.com and 1-800-Flowers.com. Moreover she holds lectures and seminars for businesses and community groups across the USA about appropriate behavior and etiquette.
Post is of the opinion that the intention of etiquette is to make life easier and not more formal or rigid. Her style is not as formal as Emily Post’s, but refers to her and has updated it. Peggy Post latest edition of Emily Post’s Etiquette includes not only an Attire Guide Beach Casual to White Tie but sections on appropriate e-mail manners, how to graciously discuss a potential sex partner’s past and the circumstances under which one can re-gift in good conscience. She believes in etiquette as human social behavior to show respect and dignity and emphasizes the line between etiquette and diversity or acceptance. In an interview she stated that she found out that all these discussions about people being rude and uncivil leads to a search for a sense of order.

Reginald Jones (artist)

Reginald Jones, R.B.A (1857–1920) was an English landscape painter, who predominantly worked in oil, watercolour and pastel.
Life and work.
Reginald Jones lived in Eltham, Kent and also in London. He travelled widely, particularly in France, Spain and Italy, producing many paintings of the landscapes he witnessed. Jones often travelled and worked with artist friends and contemporaries including Terrick Williams and Fred Kahl.
After viewing Jones' work at the Royal Institute exhibition of March 1889, the English artist and critic Walter Sickert commented 'I am not sorry for Reginald Jones or Raven Hill. Their accomplished "chic" can hold its own anywhere. It is not progressive art, though a course of it might be a wholesome tonic to our stippling brigade.'
During the winter months when opportunities to travel abroad were scarse, Jones gave lessons in water-colour painting at his studio near Hyde Park, London.
In 1905 Jones married Jessie Mary Hacon (1860–1951)of Hackney, in High Wycombe. She was the daughter of the late Edward Dennis Hacon(Surgeon & GP)& Clara Turner 
Jones was elected a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1915. He exhibited extensively at the principle London galleries from 1880 until his death in 1920.
Exhibitions.
Solo
Group
He exhibited "Silver Birch" at the Royal Academy in 1906 and "The Gipsy Encampment" in 1907. Additionally, "A Forest Stream" was exhibited at Institute of Painters in Oil Colours in 1884.
"The Mill Pond" was exhibited at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, California, 1915.

Key finder

Key Finders, also known as Keyfinders or Key Locators or Electronic Finders, are small electronic devices used to recover misplaced or lost key sets. Their goal is to reduce the time it takes to locate keys or other personal items, while remaining unobtrusive. Some key finders beep on-demand.
First Generation Key Finders.
The first generation key finders were sound based, they listened for a clap or a whistle (or a sequence of same) then beeped to the user to find them. Determining what was a clap or a whistle proved difficult, resulting in poor performance and false alarms. As a result of this low quality and reliability, these early key finders were soon discarded and were unpopular for serious needs.
Second Generation Key Finders.
Second Generation Key finders eliminated the problem of false alarms, and some have fairly long battery lives. As electronics became smaller and cheaper, radio became viable to locate the keys which were fitted with a small receiver. A credit card transmitter is used to activate receiver. All wireless key finders have to "listen" for a searching transmission, resulting in battery replacement at intervals ranging from 3 months to a year. Some distributors include a cost-effective key-return service and return service, that assists in returning the keys should they be lost in a taxi, bus or other public place, provided the customer registered their details. The transmitter card can also contain information to help return card to its rightful owner.
Third Generation Key Finders.
The latest third generation key finders no longer require a separate "base" - they are all functionally identical and based on a peer-to-peer system where each can find all the others individually. The user can, for example, use a wallet to find misplaced keys and vice versa, or a cell phone to find a lost TV remote control. In addition, since each has its own transmitter, it can reply by radio as well as beeping and flashing a light to attract attention. The seeking unit can then follow this beacon to find even a buried set of keys. Having a transmitter in each unit also means that, unlike second generation units,losing the single transmitter does not result in total loss of all items.
Uses for Key Finders.
Typical Key Finder user-experience.
A key finder is to have the device attached to a set of keys, and if these keys are lost, or misplaced,
an action is performed - such as clapping, pressing a button on a locator device.
The most basic function of a modern keyfinder device is it should i) beep, or ii) flash a light,
or iii) or somehow guide a user towards the lost item.
Key finders have also been found to be useful to the visually challenged as well as those with memory problems or illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease or Attention Deficit disorders, ADHD. Military Veterans suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder are finding key finders useful in combating the memory effects of the disease.
Modern life requires most urban dwellings, cars and offices, to be generally accessed via a key. The stress, cost and inconvenience of losing ones key to those environments is high.
Key finders are a practical way of alleviating these effects.

Rouse number

The Rouse number (P or Z) is a non-dimensional number in fluid dynamics which is used to define a concentration profile of suspended sediment and which also determines how sediment will be transported in a flowing fluid. It is a ratio between the sediment fall velocity formula_1 and the upwards velocity on the grain as a product of the von Kármán constant formula_2 and the shear velocity formula_3.
Occasionally the factor β is included before the von Kármán constant in the equation, which is a constant which correlates eddy viscosity to eddy diffusivity. 
This is generally taken to be equal to 1, and therefore is ignored in actual calculation. However, it should not be ignored when considering the full equation.
It is named after the American fluid dynamicist Hunter Rouse. It is a characteristic scale parameter in the Rouse Profile of suspended sediment concentration with depth in a flowing fluid. The concentration of suspended sediment with depth goes as the power of the negative Rouse number. It also is used to determine how the particles will move in the fluid. The required Rouse numbers for transport as bed load, suspended load, and wash load, are given below.

Muscle contracture

Muscle contractures can occur for many reasons, such as paralysis, muscular atrophy, and forms of muscular dystrophy. Fundamentally, the muscle and its tendons shorten, resulting in reduced flexibility. 
For example, in the case of partial paralysis (i.e. poliomyelitis) the loss of strength and muscle control tend to be greater in some muscles than in others, leading to an imbalance between the various muscle groups around specific joints. Case in point: when the muscles which flex the foot upward are less functional than the muscles which flex the foot downward a contracture occurs, giving the foot a progressively downward angle and loss of flexibility. Various interventions can slow, stop, or even reverse muscle contractures, ranging from physical therapy to surgery. A common cause for having the ankle lose its flexibility in this manner is from having sheets tucked in at the foot of the bed when sleeping. The weight of the sheets keep the feet flexed downward all night. Correcting this by not tucking the sheets in at the foot of the bed, or by sleeping with the feet hanging off the bed when in the prone position, is part of correcting this imbalance.
It occurs also due to muscle tightening for example if after fracture when immobilization is done by putting plaster of paris the muscle length shortens because the muscle is not used for a large span of time.
Cause.
Immobilization.
Joints are usually immobilized in a shortened position resulting in changes within the joint connective tissue, and the length of the muscle and associated tendon. Prolonged immobilization facilitates tissue proliferation which impinges on the joint space. Maintaining a shortened position for a prolonged period of time leads to: fibrous adhesion formation, loss of sarcomeres, and a loss of tissue extensibility.
Spasticity.
If spasticity is left untreated, contractures can occur. A loss of muscle tone inhibition causes a muscle to become hyperactive resulting in constant contraction, which reduces an individual’s control of the affected area. The joint will remain in a flexed state producing similar effects as listed in immobilization.
Muscle Weakness.
A muscle imbalance between an agonist and antagonist muscle can occur due to a neurological disorder, spinal cord injury, and our lifestyle/postural habits. A decrease in muscle tone leads to continuous disuse and eventually muscular atrophy. The constant contraction of the agonist muscle with minimal resistance can result in a contracture.
Treatment.
Passive Stretching.
Typically performed by Physical therapists, passive stretching is a more beneficial preventative measure and tool to maintain available range of motion (ROM) rather than used as a treatment. It is very important to continually move the limb throughout its full range at a specific velocity but a passive stretch can’t be maintained for the period of time required for optimal benefit.
Splinting.
A contracture corrective device (CCD) is a dynamic splint that provides a continuous stretch with a continuous force and operates based on the principles of creep. It is the most advantageous splint but more research is required. Splints are used in long term treatments and must be removed in order to stretch the antagonist muscle to maintain range of motion (passive stretching).
Electrical Stimulation.
Electrical stimulation improves passive range of motion but only temporarily. Once the treatment is withdrawn, all benefits are reduced. It can play a critical role in muscle atrophy prevention.
Surgery.
Surgery is a solution to muscle shortening but other complications may arise. Following muscle lengthening surgery, force production and ROM is usually reduced due to the shift in sarcomere locations between a muscle's maximal and minimal length. Shortening of the surgically lengthened muscle can re-occur.

Karel Šejna

Karel Šejna (1 November 1896, Zálezly – 17 December 1982, Prague) was a Czech double bassist and conductor, the principal conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in 1950.
Life and career.
Šejna's musical studies were at the Prague Conservatory under Professor Černý (double-bass, 1914–20) and later with K B Jirák (composition). As a young man he gave several concerts in Egypt, and on his return to Czechoslovakia in 1921 he was appointed the first double-bassist of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and shortly after (on 25 July 1922) also conducted the orchestra at a concert in "Žofín Palace" in Prague. Some compositions including a song-cycle and a string quartet date from this time.
He began to conduct on recommendation of the principal conductor of the Czech Philharmonic of that time, Václav Talich. Talich gradually entrusted him with more difficult tasks, and later recommended him to the post of conductor of the "Czechoslovak Railway Workers Symphony Orchestra" (1925–1936). From 1926 to 1938 Šejna worked also as choirmaster of the "Hlahol Choir" in Vinohrady, travelling with them to Yugoslavia and Vienna. In 1938 he was hired as the conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. He conducted hundreds of concerts, notably romantic repertoire, but also the music of 20th century. (He performed the Prague premiere of Janáček's Glagolitic Mass). In 1937-38 Šejna was engaged as guest conductor of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra.
After the emigration of Rafael Kubelík, the post-war chief of the orchestra, Šejna was for a short time appointed as the principal conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, touring with the orchestra to East and West Germany and to the UK. He was successful interpreter of the music of Hector Berlioz, César Franck, Richard Strauss and especially of Gustav Mahler. His last concert with the Czech Philharmonic took place on 11 February 1972, with Mahler's Symphony No. 4.
Recordings.
Šejna made more than 70 recordings, including Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony and Mahler's 4th symphony. He was the first conductor to have recorded most of the works of Bedřich Smetana. He also recorded complete symphonies of Zdeněk Fibich and part of the work of Antonín Dvořák.
Conducting the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, he made in 1949 the premiere recording of Martinů's Symphony No. 3 on Supraphon.
His 1959 recording of Dvořák's Slavonic Dances was awarded "Cithare d´argent - Grand Prix de l´Association Française" in Paris 1977.

""'The N's Student Body is an eight-episode reality television series that first aired on The N on July 11, 2008 that takes twelve students from high schools MacArthur and Eisenhower in Decatur, Illinois. 
Tagline:""' Competition is tough. Change is tougher.
Overview.
Host Laila Ali challenges twelve out-of-shape and overweight students from rival high schools to change their bodies, their nutrition, and their attitudes. The winning school takes home $25,000. Whoever loses the most weight wins $25,000 for themselves. The rules changed at the end of the competition, as the grand prize was awarded for "biggest overall transformation". The solo win went to Mike Walker for his overall change in attitude and self-esteem.
Every week, the two schools compete in some sort of challenge. The school who wins the challenge gets a reward, such as a yacht ride or being served dinner by the other team. The losing team gets "punishment", like husking corn or cleaning the bleachers after a high school football game.
Weigh-Ins & Evaluations.
After the challenge and reward/punishment, the schools go to the weigh in to find out what their current weight is, therefore evaluating how much weight has been lost that week. Later, the teams go to an evaluation where they are given 1 of 3 different rankings:
Green: the student is making good progress.
Yellow: the student is not making progress (3 yellows equal a Red)
Red: the student isn't invested in the competition and is asked to leave.

Films in the competition line-up, as well as those from established filmmakers, are generally presented in person by the film’s creators. In addition to its multifaceted film programme, the festival is also renowned for its top-class side-events programme, which includes the Zurich Master Class and the international Film Finance Forum – events that make ZFF one of the most important international film industry hubs. The main festival award is the Golden Eye, which is awarded in the four competition categories and to the festival’s guests of honour.
The ZFF is organised by Spoundation Motion Picture GmbH in cooperation with local institutes and sponsors, and collaborates with domestic and international distributors and producers. The idea to create an international film festival was the brainchild of Karl Spoerri, who founded the festival together with Nadja Schildknecht and Antoine Monot, Jr. 
Karl Spoerri (Artistic and Strategic Director) and Nadja Schildknecht (Managing Director) are the festival’s current Co-Directors.
History.
In 2004, Karl Spoerri and Tim Geser invited the renowned English digital film festival "onedotzero_adventures in moving image" to Zurich, where it was the guest of Zurich University of the Arts from October 29 – 31, 2004. This small-scale event developed into the Zürich Film Festival and brought together its core team.
In the spring of 2005, Karl Spoerri, Nadja Schildknecht and Antoine Monot, Jr. founded Spoundation Motion Picture GmbH, which has since been responsible for implementing the Zurich Film Festival and is currently managed by Karl Spoerri and Nadja Schildknecht. Karl Spoerri is the ZFF’s Artistic Director.
Theatres 1 – 6 at the cinema Plaza in Zurich’s district 4 provided the venues for the 1st Zurich Film Festival (October 5 – 9, 2005). The festival focussed on “Debuts” and screened approx. 8 premieres in one competition category. Further film line-ups included “Debut Classics” and “Züri Bellevue”. The first festival was well received by the public and attracted 8’000 visitors – the press and film industry reacted with initial scepticism towards the young event.
The 2nd Zurich Film Festival (October 2 – 6, 2006) took place in 2006 at the cinemas corso, Academy and Frosch – the Golden Eye was awarded for the first time in three competition categories (Young Feature Film, Young Documentary Film and Debut Feature Film). Additions to the programme included the ‘New World View’ line-up. The 2nd Zürich Film Festival attracted 18’000 visitors and 600 accredited film industry representatives.
The young festival took a huge leap forward in 2007 by extending its duration to 11 days – the festival’s current length. The films of the 3rd Zurich Film Festival (September 27 to October 7) were screened in the cinemas corso, Capitol, Frosch, Movie and Le Paris located along Zürich’s ‘Film Mile’. More than 50 world, European or Swiss premieres were presented at cinemas distributed along the quayside of Zürich’s river Limmat. The number of visitors rose within three years to 27’000. The Zurich Film Festival boasted a new Festival Centre located in the very heart of the city: A large marquee at Rathausplatz became the meeting point for cinema lovers and film workers. 2007 saw the festival programme expand to include the Zürich Coproduction Forum.
Zurich Film Festival continued to develop in the years between 2008 and 2012, with visitor numbers more than doubling. The cinemas ‘corso’ and ‘Le Paris’ have been the festival’s main screening venues for several years now; the cinema Arena Filmcity joined this list in 2011.
In 2009, Zurich Film Festival suffered a particularly unfortunate blow, which not only cast a shadow over the festival, but also made it known around the globe. Honorary guest Roman Polanski was arrested on arrival in Switzerland and held under house arrest for nine months. He returned to the Zurich Film Festival in 2011 to pick up his award two years later than planned.
In 2011, the Zurich Film Festival was offered guest rights by the city of Zurich to use the Sechseläutenwiese, where a new Festival Centre was erected. The Zurich Opera House became the new venue for the glamorous Award Night. The 2011 Zurich Film Festival attracted 51’000 visitors.
With the onedotzero section, Zurich Film Festival began bringing the most important and innovative festival in the field of digital film to Zürich in 2005. Even as a small independent film festival, the London-based creators were showing works by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Chris Cunningham, long before their names were made known to a wider audience. onedotzero_ch was the Swiss edition of the British festival, which took place within the framework of the Zurich Film Festival until 2011.
The ZFF added two films for children aged 6 and older, and two films for primary school children to its programme for the first time in 2012. Visitor figures reached a record 58’000.
With a total of 71'000 visitors, of these 4000 children and students, the festival has seen a more than 20% increase in viewer numbers in 2013. With 345 screenings of 122 film titles and some 450 national and international guests, Zurich Film Festival has once again experienced considerable growth.

Opportunity Knocks (game show)

Opportunity Knocks is a 2008 game show hosted by J.D. Roth, and executive produced by Ashton Kutcher and his Katalyst Productions. It premiered on September 23, 2008 on ABC and Citytv in Canada, but received low ratings, especially in the 18-34-year-old age demographic, and was canceled after three episodes. ABC subsequently scheduled the remaining six completed episodes for broadcast on Tuesdays at 8:00 pm beginning on May 26, 2009.
Gameplay.
At the beginning of the episode, a family is surprised by the ABC crew knocking on their door and telling them they have been selected to be on the show. They then have to answer questions about the other members of their family.
Each of the four family member contestants gets asked a series of four questions, worth, in order, $2,500, $5,000, $7,500, and $10,000. Getting all four correct (or, at some points in the game, buying the prize for a portion of their winnings, similar to "Let's Make A Deals Sure Thing) wins the family member a prize package (usually having to do with the family member's interests) in addition to all the money won. Incorrect answers do not deduct from the score, but unless the family member decided to buy the prize beforehand, they forfeit the additional prize if the family member answers any questions incorrectly.
Some questions may be tasks, such as finding a diary. Some questions involve identifying the real thing out of a group of fakes, such as picking out a bedspread out of 15 or identifying which picture a non-playing family member drew and throwing the fakes into a shredder. Other questions are just trivia questions about the family member, such as which of four girls a family member has a crush on, or about their interests, such as identifying Nick from the Jonas Brothers. Many other questions include choosing which cookies the players mother made and remembering what time the clock the father made in school is stopped on. 
In the final round, one member of the family, chosen by the family, tries to match the answers the other family members give to questions about themselves. The chosen contestant can try to double the family's cash winnings—without risk—by correctly matching two answers, or to risk the family's cash (but not prizes) for a chance at the grand prize of $250,000 by matching all three. The contestant must make his or her choice before hearing the questions asked. If the contestant chooses to make two matches, he or she must decide which two to match; if either of those two answers is wrong, the contestant does not get a third chance. If either of the three answers are wrong, the game is over and the contestant walked away without any money, but all prizes that are not cash are kept.

Vincent DiMartino

Vincent "Vinnie" DiMartino (born October 9, 1972) is an American motorcycle builder, best known for his work from 2002 to 2007 at Orange County Choppers (OCC), the subject of the American TV show American Chopper. In August 2007 DiMartino left Orange County Choppers and founded V-Force Customs, a custom motorcycle shop in Rock Tavern, NY. Several months later, Cody Connelly, a friend and co-worker of DiMartino at Orange County Choppers also left to join him at V-force Customs. In 2010, DiMartino returned to the show; however instead of rejoining his former employer, OCC, he joined Paul Jr. Designs.
DiMartino, known as "Vinnie," was born to John and Margaret DiMartino. He is the second child of four. DiMartino and his wife Melissa have three girls and a boy, Vanessa, twins Isabella and Ava, and Vincent.
History.
DiMartino was born in 1972 in New York's Hudson Valley. At the age of nine DiMartino started hanging around his father's auto repair shop and soon became a "gearhead". At the age of 14 he began working for a small engine repair shop. A few years later he was rebuilding cars and motorcycles and pretty much anything else he could get his hands on. In 2002 DiMartino started working for Orange County Choppers which was owned by high school friend Paul Teutul Jr.'s father. Although a pilot episode was shot just before he was hired, it was only a month after starting his new job that DiMartino learned The Discovery Channel was turning his workplace into a reality television show called "American Chopper".
Career.
DiMartino spent five years working for Orange County Choppers before leaving in August 2007.
Departure from OCC.
There has been a lot of discussion on the internet about the factors that led to Vincent leaving OCC. From the VForceCustoms website "FAQ" Vinnie responds to the question stating: "I had gone as far as I could there. I really didn’t have any chance for advancement, and I had always wanted to have my own shop, so the natural progression was to leave and start my own place. Nothing against them, but it was time to move on."
The American Chopper episode in which DiMartino leaves dedicated a little over four minutes to his departure. After he gave his notice, Paul Teutul Sr. was shown saying "everyone's replaceable" which he claims was only a fragment of what he actually said. OCC has said that they have no control over the editing of the show and what parts of the dialog are edited out.
V-Force Customs.
Soon after leaving OCC, DiMartino started V-Force Customs located in Rock Tavern, NY, V-Force Customs is located in a brand new building designed for building bikes. V-force Customs first build was "V-Force 1", unveiled in Daytona Beach, Florida. Soon after the success of "V-force 1", V-force built a custom chopper for the Tampa Bay Storm Arena League Football team. Vinnie and Cody Connelly announced the build from mid-field at a Storm game at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida. The Tampa Bay Storm chopper was unveiled at The Storms' final game of the season on June 21, 2008. The bike is touring the southeast United States with all proceeds going to the Pinellas County Humane Society and The Shriners Hospital for Children in Tampa. Also in June, V-Force Customs had its ribbon cutting and grand opening in Rock Tavern, New York.
New Series.
DiMartino appeared in the series "Throttle Junkies TV" on Resort and Residence TV, AMG TV, Untamed Sports TV, Altitude Sports and Entertainment, Bright House Sports Network, Cox Sports, CW West Palm, Time Warner Cable Sports (Buffalo/Syracuse), and LoneStar Cable Network. The series premiered on February 14, 2010. In a radio interview in June 2010, Dimartino stated that he was going to work with Paul Teutul, Jr. again at Paul Jr. Designs which will air as "" while still running V-Force. Part of the agreement of DiMartino being on the show was that he would be able to wear hats and T-shirts bearing the V-Force logo to ensure that people wouldn't think that V-Force was out of business. DiMartino made his debut appearing in the first episode of the revamped series which aired in the U.S. on The Discovery Channel on Aug. 12, 2010.

Breezin'

Breezin' is an album by jazz/soul guitarist George Benson. It is his debut on Warner Bros. Records.
Commercial performance.
The album marked the beginning of Benson's most successful period commercially. "Breezin"' topped the Pop, Jazz and R&B album charts in Billboard and spun off two hit singles, the title song (which has become a smooth jazz standard) and "This Masquerade," which was a top ten pop and R&B hit. The album itself was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA.
The album won multiple prizes at the 1977 Grammy Awards. The album won the awards Best Pop Instrumental Performance for Benson and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for Al Schmitt and was nominated as Album of the Year for Tommy LiPuma and Benson. "This Masquerade" received the award Record of the Year for LiPuma and Benson, while it was nominated as Song of the Year for Leon Russell and as Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male for Benson.
Critical reception.
In a contemporary review for "The Village Voice", music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a "C" and dismissed most of its music as "mush". In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Richard S. Ginell gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and said that, although Benson's guitar is "as assured and fluid as ever", "Breezin" is "really not so much a breakthrough as it is a transition album; the guitar is still the core of his identity." 
Original Version.
Gábor Szabó, a Hungarian jazz guitarist, recorded the original version of the title track "Breezin"', and has expressed disdain for Benson's success with his arrangement. Coincidentally, LiPuma produced both versions.
In 2004, Donny Osmond redid the song as Breeze On By, using the original arrangement and guitar licks and adding a vocal track.

Skateboarding & Leeside.
Matasi was a well-known skateboarder in the Vancouver skate scene. 
As a youth, he created his own skatespot in a tunnel the Hastings and Cassiar connector in Vancouver, BC. The spot later became known as Leeside and is well known locally and throughout Canada.

Life & Art.
Lee was interested in art from a young age. As a youth, he grew up painting graffiti under the alias 'Avers', a name apparently chosen because of art's resemblance to 'a verse' on a page. After high school, Lee was in the Fine Arts program at Langara College in Vancouver, BC, in the year 2002. After completing the program, he spent a few months painting in an abandoned castle owned by a relative in a small town in France.

MetroPlaza (), also written as Metroplaza and Metro Plaza, is a high-rise development located in the Kwai Chung district of the New Territories in Hong Kong. The complex contains two towers situated above the Metroplaza shopping centre: MetroPlaza Tower 1 and MetroPlaza Tower 2. MetroPlaza Tower 2 is the taller of the two towers, rising 47 floors and to the top of its decorative spire and logo. The building was completed in 1992. It was designed by architectural firm Wong Tung & Partners, and was developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties. MetroPlaza Tower 2, which stands as the 41st-tallest building in Hong Kong, is composed entirely of commercial office space. The building is an example of postmodern architecture.
MetroPlaza Tower 1 has the same roof height and floor count as MetroPlaza Tower 2, but is significantly shorter due to the absence of a spire; the building does not even rank among the 100 tallest structures in the city. The tower rises 47 floors and in height.

<doc id="18447441" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18447441" title="Sowa (surname)">
Sowa (surname)

Sowa is a surname of Polish origin.
Etymology.
The surname Sowa finds its origins as a literal unadulterated word in the Polish language. Polish name expert Prof. Kazimierz Rymut mentions this name in his book "Nazwiska Polaków" ("The Surnames of Poles"). Professor Rymut says the name appears in records as early as 1404 and comes from the noun 'sowa', which means 'owl'. Even today, this word may be found in any common Polish dictionary, as well as Belorussian, Russian or Ukrainian. Fred Hoffman, author of "Polish Surnames", explains that a common practice in the early days of surname adoption was its bestowal upon people as a nickname because of their connection to the meaning behind the name, which was in this case, an owl.
Ostpreussen (East Prussia) Germany.
The Sowa surname first appears on church records in the late 17th century in the small towns and hamlets of the Soldau region of Ostpreussen, Preussen, Germany. This area is located in the north-central area of modern-day Poland and is known as Działdowo. There is also another branch of the Sowa family which is known to have resided at that same time period in south-western corner of modern-day Poland. Why these distinct branches of the Sowa family are separated by such a great distances is currently unknown. Some discussion has been given to a religious rift. The Lutheran families went to the north, while the Roman Catholic families went to the south. Earlier history for the Sowa surname is currently unknown due to lack of records for that period. Due to the geopolitical history of the region, the inhabitants may have spoken either German or Polish, depending on which country ruled the region at the time. In almost all cases, the church records were kept in German, and sometimes in Latin. The majority of the names will be found in the records of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches of the time, though there were also some records in the Reformed Lutheran and Catholic Church records.
Southern Germany.
Additional information is needed.
Pronunciation.
There are several historical spellings and pronunciations for the surname Sowa, probably dependent on the linguistical influence of the particular time. In earlier dates, the surname appears as Szowa, a Polish spelling rendition, and would be pronounced in English as 'Sho-vah'. In later times, the 'z' was dropped, probably due to increasing German influence, so that it appeared as 'Sowa'. Despite the change in spelling, and according to German pronunciation practice, the name was still pronounced the same, the 'so' combination having the same sound as an 'sh' combination in English. Today, the surname continues the 'Sowa' spelling, but has lost a bit of the original pronunciation. In English it is most commonly and correctly pronounced as 'So-wah', and in Polish as 'So-vah'.
Dissemination.
The Sowa surname may be found on most continents of the world as follows:
North America.
In North America, it seems that there were three major points of settlement, all in the United States. These were Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Texas. It is presumed that these three locations were chosen due to the large populations of German immigrants, and climatic and geographical similarities to homeland Germany, thus providing comfortable environment. Today, Sowas are found throughout North America.
Pennsylvania.
Most members of the Sowa family in Pennsylvania settled in the areas surrounding the city of Reading. From here, it is also known that some members of the family migrated to Minnesota and elsewhere.
Minnesota.
The concentration point for Sowas in Minnesota were the areas surrounding the city of Popple Creek.
Texas.
The Sowa families of Texas emigrated primarily from the southwestern area of Poland mentioned previously. There has been little or no connection proven as yet between the Sowa families of Texas and those of Pennsylvania and Minnesota.
Europe.
The Sowa surname exists throughout Europe.
Australia.
The Sowa surname is found in Australia, probably due to documented migration in the late 19th century.
Africa.
The Sowa surname is also found in Ghana, some are spelled with an 'h' at the end 'Sowah'.

Azzun Atma

Archeology.
The village is ancient, with old stones reused in homes. The mosque is possibly an old church. Byzantine ceramics have also been found.
History.
The place appeared in 1596 Ottoman tax registers as 'Azzun, being in the "Nahiya" of Jabal Qubal of the "Liwa" of Nablus. It had a population of 29 households and 2 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, summercrops, olives, goats and beehives.
When the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the place in 1870 it was described it as a large Arab village, then deserted. Many small, square houses were still partly standing, and near the mosque he noticed old columns and large stone from older buildings. Old fig trees and beautiful mimosa were scattered through the ruins. In "The Survey of Western Palestine" (1882), it is also described as a "ruined village".

Werner Stark

Werner Stark (2 December 1909 – 4 October 1985) was a sociologist and economist, who made important contributions to the sociology of knowledge, the sociology of religion and the history of economic thought. 
Biography.
Werner Stark was born in Marienbad, Austrian Empire (now in the Czech Republic), to parents of Jewish origin. His father, Adolf Stark, was a physician for a miners' union and a socialist city council member. His birth was registered by the rabbi of Marienbad, but he was raised as an atheist. After completing his secondary education in Marienbad, he enrolled in the University of Hamburg to study economics and social sciences. He spent the 1930-31 session at the London School of Economics. Stark's training and scholarship encompassed history, philosophy, political science, law, economics, literature, art, music, and sociology. He held doctorates both in law and in political science. The rise of Nazism resulted in his leaving Germany for Prague in 1934, where he became a lecturer at the Prague School of Political Science.
In 1939, when the invading Nazis closed the university, Stark left for England, where he settled in Cambridge. He became interested in the economic writings of the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and submitted three essays on the subject to John Maynard Keynes, editor of the "Economic Journal": Keynes was impressed, and encouraged Stark to work further on the subject, and to produce an edition of Bentham's economic writings (eventually published under the auspices of the Royal Economic Society in three volumes in 1952-54). In 1941, influenced by the writings of John Henry Newman, Stark converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1944, he was called up to serve in the British Army, initially in the Pioneer Corps and afterwards in the Intelligence Corps. 
After the war, Stark taught at British universities, including Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Manchester, until his acceptance in 1963 of a professorship at Fordham University, New York. He stayed at Fordham until his mandatory retirement in 1975, when he returned to Europe, holding an honorary professorship at the University of Salzburg, Austria, until his death there in 1985.
Stark was internationally recognized for work in the sociology of religion, social theory, and sociology of knowledge. His scholarship was consistently multidisciplinary, his research constantly nourished by his teaching. After his conversion, his adopted religion became an important influence in his life. Stark was distressed by what he considered religion's erosion in the modern world, strongly believing that religion provides guidelines for individual action that neither custom nor law can give. As he saw it, excessive individualism lay at the root of Christianity's contemporary crisis. He believed that modern intellectuals had been strongly affected by post-Renaissance rationalism, resulting in "a super-rationalism which tends to blind them towards many non-rational values, for instance, those of tradition, of religion, and even of art" ("The Sociology of Knowledge", Routledge, 1958).
In the sociology of religion, Stark considered Weber's work a challenge of great importance, although he thought Weber lacked necessary insight into "true religiosity" ("The Sociology of Religion", 5 volumes, Fordham University Press, 1966-1972). His international reputation was both reflected and built by translations of many of his works into Japanese, Italian, German, and Spanish. "The Social Bond" (6 volumes, Fordham University Press, 1976-1987) is considered by some critics to be definitive in establishing his intellectual legacy.

The kibbutz was established in 1933 by members of the Gordonia youth movement who had previously been living in Ness Ziona. The land had been bought by the Jewish National Fund in 1930.
An important Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site in the vicinity of the kibbutz is under excavation since early 1990s by an expedition of Hebrew University of Jerusalem directed by Professor Nigel Goring-Morris. According to the excavator, the site represents a regional funerary center.The site is associated with the Neolithic transition.

Wildlife Australia Fund

Wildlife Australia Fund, Inc. is a United States based international charitable organization established for the conservation, research and restoration of the environment. It was established and founded by an American and is supported by Australian expatriates in New York. It is established to assist in the acquisition of land in Australia for the conservation of threatened species and ecosystems, conducting research into conservation and biodiversity in Australia and undertaking public education regarding Australian wildlife conservation. It encourages active participation worldwide to help restore the balance to the delicate ecosystem of Australia. Funding comes from tax-deductible donations from the public.
History.
The organisation was founded by American, John Streicker, Chairman of Sentinel Corporation. Streicker, a New Yorker, visited Australia after 11 September where he ended up buying a flower farm outside of Perth, Western Australia. Following that visit, Streicker met Atticus Fleming, Chief Executive of Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) who introduced him to the natural diversity of Australia's unique and endangered species and ecosystems. 
Upon returning to the United States, Streicker established Wildlife Australia Fund, Inc., which is a 501(c)(3) public charity. It is supported by a group of Australian expatriates living in New York City who wanted to highlight to the world the global significance of Australia’s unique wildlife and the extinction threat that they face, as well as a vehicle in which globally based Australians and their international friends could financially contribute and give back to the Australian community. The expatriate supporters will be hosting fundraising events throughout the United States in order to support various projects of Wildlife Australia Fund.
Projects.
One of Wildlife Australia Fund's first major projects is to actively support a contract to purchase Pungalina Station, a vast property covering 195,000 hectares (482,000 acres) in the outback of the Northern Territory. Pungalina is seen by Wildlife Australia Fund as one of the last great wilderness areas of northern Australia and its acquisition important for the conservation of a suite of unique and endangered Australian flora and fauna, including 500 plant species, 20 frog species, 75 reptile species, 170 bird species and 35 mammal species.

Earwig (band)

Earwig is an indie rock band from Columbus, Ohio. They release music on their own "micro-indie" LFM Records label. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Lizard McGee, bassist Costa Hondroulis, and drummer George Hondroulis. While they have drawn occasional national attention, Earwig has remained unable to break out of the underground, ultimately overshadowed by the Seattle Grunge movement of the 1990s.
History.
The beginning.
In February 1992, the band recorded a 5 song demo tape called "Dead Slow Hoot" to 1/2" 8 track in McGee's garage. The response was promising, and after sending the tape out to zine and record labels, McGee received calls back from labels such as 4AD, Warner Bros. and Capitol Records.
At this time, Earwig consisted of Lizard McGee on guitars and vocals, Chuck Palmer on drums and bassist Jeff Perkins. The group was soon joined by Terry Lo on guitar and cello. The four-piece began playing shows as they worked on their debut CD, "Mayfeeder". With the release of this CD, Terry Lo and Jeff Perkins left the band and Rich Cefalo joined on bass for the nationwide tour.
Earwig is featured with Interview and Photo in The Big Takeover Issue No. 61, 2007
Mayfeeder-Perfect Past Tense.
In 1996 drummer Chuck Palmer left the band and was briefly replaced by Brad Swinarski, who played only two shows with Earwig before leaving the band. Swinarski participated in two recording sessions with the band resulting in three released songs: A cover of "Do They Know It’s Christmas?" released on the LFM Chris-single cassette, "Anatomical Gift" and "Two Dragons." In 1996, Justin Crooks, formerly the drummer for LFM band Parsnip, joined Earwig on drums. This trio of Rich Cefalo on bass, Justin Crooks on drums, Lizard McGee on guitar and vocals recorded "Perfect Past Tense" with producers Steve Evans (who also produced the Major Label debut of Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments on American Recordings) and Jared Kotler (producer of the multi-planinum selling band Marcy Playground on Capitol Records) in Long Island, NY. The band toured the Midwest and east coast, eventually releasing a very limited, hand-pressed, early edition of "Perfect Past Tense" in late 1999 at a show in Columbus. Cefalo moved to New York City. He went on to direct the music video for the song The Horror, the first single from RjD2’s debut album Deadringer. Rich now plays in the NYC band ‘Estranged Estates’ with Chuck Palmer, who also moved to New York in 2000, on drums.
Move to California.
McGee moved to California in 2000 and released the widely available version of Perfect Past Tense on CD on LFM Records that same year. That same year he began running LFM Records, increasing their distribution and recognition. Playing live in the Bay Area as a duo with drummer Raj Kapololu, McGee also went on 2 solo tours of the West Coast, playing shows in Seattle, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. McGee and Kapololu also recorded several un-released demos at Avalon studios in San Jose, CA. McGee returned to Ohio and in 2004 teamed up with bassist Matt Wagner. Previously, when bassist Rich Cefalo moved to New York City and was unavailable, Matt Wagner (of LFM Band Preston Furman) sat in with Earwig on the bass in Athens, Ohio at Follett’s Bookstore. Wagner also played bass during 1999 with the “LFM All-Stars” which included Justin Crooks on the drums, Brad Swinarski on keyboards and Lizard McGee on guitar and vocals. Joshua Sheik joined McGee and Wagner for live shows in 2004 and 2005. Sheik left the band in 2005 and drummer Justin Crooks returned to the band.
Dream Writing.
As songwriter Lizard McGee has stated, many of his songs come from dreams. The song "Used Kids" is a literal re-telling of a fever dream about Y2K and Ron House (founding member of The Great Plains and Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments). All of the songs on Gibson Under Mountain come from dreams. McGee speculates that these series of connected dreams may have been a result of the heavy medicines he was taking at the time. McGee tells the story of the album title (Gibson Under Mountain): “The album title came in a dream… I’m sitting in the center of a huge movie theater… a white light glows through the movie screen, filling it with large block letters… name your album GIBSON UNDER MOUNTAIN.” And from there, all the songs subsequently came from dreams and dream imagery." Other songs resulted from dream visitations from a giant cockroach that spoke in a clicking language and a bloody headless woman.
Albums.
"Mayfeeder".
Earwig's debut album, "Mayfeeder", brought the band to the top of the Columbus underground scene, being the catalyst of the greatness to come. "Dinosaur Song", McGee said, was taken verbatim from a dream his girlfriend had. "She woke me up one night and she just turned to me and said, 'I had a dream that we were dinosaurs, with little arms and long tails and big big scales, and you were trying to hold my hand.' I thought it was so perfect that I went and wrote it down. The song's first two verses are essentially the same as what she said to me. A friend of mine made a kid's book from the lyrics."
Despite the bitterness and melancholy evoked by some of Earwig's songs, ("Wounded Knee" and "Mink" come to mind), songwriting isn't necessarily a form of therapy for McGee. "I don't sit down to write a song based on this specific experience, although sometimes I'll look back and say, oh yeah, this is about that time in my life. And a lot of people have mentioned that they see childhood things in my music but I don't look at writing songs like I'm trying to work out a fucked-up childhood or anything. It doesn't stem from problems even if unconsciously my songs are about certain times in my life. I think I'm a pretty well-adjusted person."
"Bored in Chicago".
Earwig's debut single, "Dinosaur Song/Wounded Knee," was released on LFM in 1993 with their first album, "Mayfeeder," in 1994. Followed by a national tour in the summer of 1994, when "Bored In Chicago" was recorded at a tour stop at the Elbow Room in Chicago. "Bored in Chicago" is taken from a cassette recording of the night’s performance at the club. It was extensively bootlegged and eventually “officially” released as Earwig’s first Live album in 1995.
In 1996 LFM Records was featured in an article for the Columbus Dispatch. Due to the media hype surrounding the search for the “Next Seattle”, the magazine Entertainment Weekly came to Columbus and featured a full page photo of LFM Records/Earwig with an article on how Columbus was a contender for the next big break-out scene in America.
"Perfect Past Tense".
Five years after the release of their debut album, Earwig resurfaced from the Columbus indie rock underground with 1999's "Perfect Past Tense." . Previously available as part of the group's 1994 live effort, "Bored In Chicago" (recently re-released on CD by McGee's own Lizard Family Music imprint), "Cinema East" reappears as a studio recorded version on this album . "Perfect Past Tense" also includes several other tracks that were previously available only on "Bored in Chicago," including "Sleep With Me", "Dress", "Nineteen", "Anything", and "Stain".
The album is number 8 on Columbus Alive list of "The Top 100 Columbus Albums of the Past 30 Years".
"Center of the Earth".
Earwig's third studio album, "Center of the Earth" contains the single which truly brought popularity to the band.
The single "Used Kids" was ranked 15th on WWCD FM's "CD101 Top 101 of 2007".
Earwig's latest album "Center of the Earth" is available for purchase from the major retail store, Meijer and available for purchase through iTunes 
The story behind the song "Used Kids".
“The first show I ever played with my first band was at Used Kids. Ron House raved about how he loved the band and thought that we were great. It had an impact on me and I’ve always loved Used Kids,” McGee says. “One night I had a dream. I was at a 7/11 and Ron was working behind the counter. It was a 7/11 but it was Used Kids too. Ron had a big baseball cap with a rebel flag patch on it and kept following me around with a copy of the Weekly World News with the picture of a mushroom cloud that has Jesus’ face in it. Ron was spewing about how he wanted to save my soul and how the world was coming to an end. I got very concerned for Ron’s well-being and eventually asked him if he needed a ride home from the store. His response was ‘Hey man, don’t worry, I got a ride. I’m going home with Jesus tonight!’ I woke up in a strange daze, grabbed a guitar and wrote the song all the way through, pretty much on the first try, in about 10 minutes. It’s a direct re-telling of the dream, blow for blow and a lot of the lyrics are taken verbatim from the dream.” 
Gibson Under Mountain.
Earwig's 4th studio album was released in June 2010.
Pause For The Jets.
As of April, 2013, Earwig is self-recording a "Science Fiction Rock Opera" in their basement on a Mac laptop Pro Tools software engine. The follow-up to Gibson Under Mountain will be the band's 5th studio album and first to feature the Brothers Hondroulis as the rhythm section. The album is due on LFM Records in February 2014. The band is said to be collaborating with mysterious third coast underground producer and beat-maker James Z. Z approached the band after hearing them on a cassette that he bought at the RCC thrift store located at 23rd and Ursuline in Galveston, Texas. The Houston, Texas hip-hop music blog Waffles & Wings has previously published suspicions that James Z is actually hip-hop mogul Jay Z.
Year of the Drag.
Earwig's only DVD released to date, Year of the Drag, was released in 2005 in between albums "Perfect Past Tense" and "Center of the Earth." Directed, compiled, and edited by Allan Foster, the DVD features eight live performances, including singles "Used Kids" and "Outro". The DVD also contains rare audio tracks, three never before seen videos, and a photo montage which portrays the development of the band.

Mizra

Mizra (, "lit." Sowing) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located between Afula and Nazareth, it falls under the jurisdiction of Jezreel Valley Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 689.
History.
The kibbutz was established on a tell named Ruba al-Natzra during Hanukkah in 1923 by the first immigrants of the Third Aliyah. The following year the founders were joined by a group which had formed in Haifa, and in the 1930s they were joined by Galician Hashomer Hatzair members from Aliyah Bet. During the British Mandate of Palestine, Mizra hosted the Palmach headquarters, until it was discovered by the Mandate authorities in Operation Agatha of 1946. The kibbutz also has a museum portraying the history of the Yishuv.
The name Mizra can be found on maps from the Middle Ages, though its exact origin is unknown. There is one theory that it is derived from nearby Nahal Mizra, though some believe that is connected to Hovat Mizra, an ancient farm in the area.
Economy.
Mizra is known in Israel for its meat processing plant and its store, Maadaney Mizra (Mizra delicatessen), which for many years was Israel's only provider of non-kosher meat, most notably pork. For the Israeli religious public, it was a symbol of impurity and a violation of the state's Jewish character. During the aftermath of "the dirty trick" affair of 1990, an Agudat Yisrael MK said of a Mizra member that he "not only sold pig, he acted like one". The Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s brought Mizra competitors, and it eventually sold 75 percent of the plant to Tiv Ta'am, an Israeli supermarket chain that sells pork. 
In 2007, Maadaney Mizra was threatened as Russian-Israeli billionaire Arcadi Gaydamak announced his plan to purchase Tiv Ta'am and turn it kosher, saying he would make Mizra supply chicken instead of pork. However, the deal fell through a few months later, when Gaydamak discovered a contract between Tiv Ta'am and Mizra, that prevented the chain from changing Mizra's character.
Today, in addition to the meat processing plant, Mizra employs a hydraulic machinery factory, and a factory for injecting metal powder. It also has a hotel and a room letting branch, for students of the nearby Max Stern Academic College of Emek Yezreel. In addition, the kibbutz also operates a center for alternative medicine, including Reiki, reflexology and Shiatsu.

Wii Speak

Wii Speak is a microphone accessory for Nintendo's Wii video game console. Connected to the console via USB, the device can be placed near the video display, allowing voice chat to be conducted with the entire room. The device features an LED to indicate when the microphone is active. Wii Speak was announced at Nintendo's 2008 E3 media briefing. It was released separately and bundled with "" on November 16, 2008, in North America, and was released on December 5, 2008, in Europe.
The Wii Speak accessory is succeeded by the embedded microphone on the Wii U's GamePad controller.
Design.
According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the microphone is designed to "clearly capture many different voices being spoken in a room at the same time and convey that over the Internet." Addressing concerns over background noise due to the placement of the microphone near a television set, "Animal Crossing: City Folk" producer Katsuya Eguchi states that the device is designed to filter out video game sound from the audio speakers. Miyamoto notes that the quality of the noise filtering functionality in the Wii Speak is "very good", which may be contributing to the cost of the device. A switch was originally planned, but the microphone now turns on only when a compatible game wants access to it.
Software.
At E3, when asked why the device would not be bundled with "City Folk", Nintendo senior managing director Shigeru Miyamoto replied that cost was the factor behind the decision, adding that some users may prefer playing the game without a microphone, and that others may want to use Wii Speak who are not interested in buying "City Folk". In contrast with previous statements, Nintendo later revealed that a bundle of Wii Speak and "City Folk" would also be released. The bundle was a limited edition, released the same day as the standalone products.
Wii Speak Channel.
On October 2, 2008, Nintendo announced that Wii Speak would have its own Wii Channel. The Wii Speak Channel can be unlocked for download by a 16-digit Wii Download Ticket, included with the Wii Speak package upon purchase. Those who enter the 16-digit code on the Wii Shop Channel are allowed to download the Wii Speak Channel, which was launched on December 5, 2008. If for any reason, the download ticket was lost or used on another Wii, users could obtain a new download ticket via email from Nintendo. Prior to the launch, customers could download the Wii Speak Channel Download Assistant, a channel which gave information about the release of the Wii Speak Channel. After the release, the Download Assistant updated itself into the actual channel. 
The channel allows users to chat in one of four rooms with Wii Friends using Wii Speak online. There is no limit to the number of people that can be in each room. Each user will be represented by their Mii, which will lip sync to their spoken words. In addition, users will also be able to leave audio messages on the Wii message board for other users, as well as make audio captions for their stored photos. Users can also share photo slideshows and comment on them.

Fort Témiscamingue

Fort Témiscamingue was a trading post from the 17th century in Duhamel-Ouest, Quebec, near Ville-Marie, Canada, located on the fur trade route on the east shore of Lake Timiskaming. The fort is a National Historic Site of Canada.
History.
Since Lake Timiskaming is at the northwest "corner" of the Ottawa River where its course turns from west to southeast, the lake is a natural site for a trading post. It was on the main canoe route from Hudson Bay to the Saint Lawrence (James Bay, Moose Factory, Abitibi River, Lake Abitibi, portage, Lake Timiskaming, Ottawa River southeast to Montreal). The lake was about the midpoint of a forty day journey. The Hudson Bay expedition (1686) was the first European group to use the route.
Circa 1679, Montreal merchants established a fort on the west side of Lake Timiskaming to compete with the English posts on the Hudson Bay, but it was destroyed by the Iroquois in 1688. In 1720, a new Fort Témiscamingue was founded by French merchants on the east side of The Narrows where the two shores of Lake Timiskaming come closer than to each other, a former Algonquin encampment site called "Obadjiwan Point" (meaning "the strait where the current flows"). After the fall of New France the post was re-occupied by independent traders, the North West Company (1788) and the Hudson's Bay Company (1821). At the insistence of George Simpson (administrator) it was supplied from Moose Factory rather than the more efficient Montreal. After 1863 it was again supplied from Montreal due to improvements in the transportation system. The arrival of lumbermen and later railroads and steamboats transformed the trading post into a general store. In 1887 the main store moved to Ville-Marie, Quebec. The fort lingered on until it was closed in 1902. Around 1980 there were only some standing chimneys, but today there is a historic site.
A Roman Catholic mission originally established at Fort Témiscamingue on the eastern shore of Lake Timiskaming in present-day Quebec was relocated to the Ontario shore of the lake in 1863. The mission comprised a presbytery for the Oblate fathers, a small hospital operated by two Grey Sisters of the Cross, and eventually a frame church.
National historic site.
Declared a national historic site in 1931, the site is notable for its cultural and natural heritage. The park's territory is mainly three distinct natural areas: the plateau, the escarpments and the lowlands. Overall, over 80% of the total area of the park is a wooded area with approximately 20 different stands and a number of plants from the climatic forest type of the Laurentian maple stand and the Upper St. Lawrence forest sub-region. Of particular interest is a forest of cedar trunks so twisted that it was nicknamed the "Enchanted Forest".
Of the fort itself not much remained, but a modern visitor's centre, exhibits, and reenactments highlight the cultural history of the place.

<doc id="18447779" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18447779" title="Monastery of São Dinis de Odivelas">
Monastery of São Dinis de Odivelas

The Monastery of Saint Denis () is located in the city of Odivelas, near Lisbon, in Portugal. The feminine Cistercian convent was founded by King Dinis I and was built during the 14th century in Gothic style. It is the burial place of the king.
History.
According to a legend, King Dinis was hunting near Beja when he was attacked by a bear, which made him fall off his horse. Fearing for his life, Dinis swore to found a monastery if he could escape alive. In the combat that ensued, the King managed to plunge his dagger into the heart of the beast and kill it. That would be the origin of the monastery of Odivelas.
What is known for certain is that King Dinis founded the feminine Cistercian monastery in 1295 on an isolated spot of the Portuguese hinterland, around which the village of Odivelas developed. The works proceeded swiftly, being mostly finished some ten years after the foundation stone had been laid. King Dinis I died in 1325 and was buried in a Gothic tomb the church of the monastery. One of the king's daughters, Princess Maria Afonso (d. 1320), is also buried here.
The existence of a royal palace in Odivelas meant that the monastery was favoured by some Portuguese monarchs during the Middle Ages. An important figure associated with the monastery is Queen Philippa of Lancaster, who lived some time in the monastery until her death in 1415. The Queen was provisionally buried in the church of the monastery until being translated to the Monastery of Batalha.
In the early 16th century there were several improvements in the monastery, including the building of a new cloister in Manueline style and a Renaissance gallery by the entrance. In the early 18th century, the monastery was frequently visited by King John V, who had a scandalous affair with Mother Paula (1701-1768), abbess of the monastery. They had an illegitimate son, José, one of the so-called Children of Palhavã.
The Odivelas monastery was greatly damaged by the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake, and had to be partially rebuilt. The nave of the church, in particular, was totally remodelled, leaving only the apse and its three chapels in the original 14th-century Gothic style.
With the dissolution of religious orders in the 19th century, the monastery was adapted by the Portuguese military to serve as an educational institution for girls.
Art & architecture.
Of the original monastery built in the early 14th century, only the apse of the church and parts of the cloisters remain. The apse is a typical example of the plain Gothic of the monasteries built by the mendicant orders in mediaeval Portugal: clear forms and little decoration. The apse is composed of a main chapel and two side chapels, all of polygonal shape and reinforced with buttresses. In the interior, all chapels are covered by rib vaulting and are illuminated by three windows. Another Gothic chapel was added to the south side of the apse in 1425. In spite of its late date, this chapel is similar to the earlier ones in architectural terms. The original nave of the church had three aisles, but after the 1755 earthquake the space was unified under a single aisle.
One of the lateral chapels of the apse keeps the tomb of King Dinis, decorated with the recumbent figure of the king. His tomb, as well as that of his daughter Maria Afonso, are remarkable examples of early 14th-century Portuguese sculpture, even though they were damaged by the 1755 earthquake and by Napoleonic troops that invaded Portugal in the 19th century.
The monastery has two cloisters. The main cloister was built in the 14th century, but nowadays only parts of the original vaulting still exist. In the early 16th century the monastery was partially remodelled in Manueline style. The main cloister gained many Manueline portals, and a second cloister, nicknamed the "Claustro da Moura" was built. Later in the century a gallery (loggia) in Mannerist style was added to the façade.
An important legacy of the early 18th century is the refectory of the monastery, decorated by painted wooden panels on the ceiling and tile ("azulejo") panels on the walls.

Avlis has a unique database-driven crafting system, a highly customized magic system, a specialized companion training system, and underwater areas. Players can also discover in-game boosts to classes such as a barbarian rage system that introduces different ways to rage, and specialized spell casting abilities that go above and beyond normal wizard powers. Spellcasters can change the elemental type of any spell they cast using special metamagic rods.

<doc id="18447843" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18447843" title="Wii Sports Resort">
Wii Sports Resort

"Wii Sports Resort" is a simple collection of twelve sports games, which includes enhanced games from "Wii Sports" along with completely new selections, designed to take advantage of the motion sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Like "Wii Sports", players mimic the actions performed in real life sports, but are controlled with greater accuracy due to the precision capabilities of the Wii MotionPlus in order to provide a more immersive experience.
The game was well received by game critics, gaining an aggregate score of 82.94% on GameRankings and 80% on Metacritic. As of March 2013, the game is the third best-selling game on the Wii, after its predecessor "Wii Sports" and "Mario Kart Wii", with 31.89 million copies sold worldwide.
Gameplay.
"Wii Sports Resort" is a sports game set in a beach resort on an archipelago called Wuhu Island. The first time a player starts the game, several instructional videos will play, then the strap usage screen and the Wii MotionPlus test, and finally, the player will skydive to Wuhu Island. Twelve different sports are available to play; like the original, the sports are each played by holding the Wii Remote (and in some cases, the Nunchuk) in a manner similar to the actual sport being replicated. For example, in archery, the player holds the Wii Remote vertically to hold the bow, and pulls back the Nunchuk to pull back the bow's string. The new feature that "Wii Sports Resort" brings is Wii MotionPlus compatibility, which enables 1:1 control and allows the games to be played with greater accuracy. For example, the game's new variation, table tennis, gives the player greater control over adding spin to the ball by twisting the Wii Remote while swinging. Also in golf, you can spin the ball by twisting the Wii Remote while swinging. Most sports with up to three or four players will allow one Wii Remote to be shared among players while taking turns. The only sports in this game returning from the original "Wii Sports "are Bowling and Golf, while Table Tennis was originally a game in "Wii Play. "The other nine sports are completely new to the series.
Development.
The idea for a sequel to "Wii Sports" was considered well before the advent of the Wii MotionPlus peripheral, but development only moved forward when the new possibilities in control were realized. The game was first revealed at Nintendo's 2008 E3 presentation.
Fishing and a water slide were considered for inclusion in the game. A prototype kendama minigame was also created, but did not fit into the resort theme.
Wuhu Island originally appeared in "Wii Fit", and was slightly modified to fit the profile of a resort island. Hotels, sport arenas (bowling alley, tennis courts, and sword play arena), a castle, ruins of an older civilization, and some new rock formations were added. The island also appears in "Wii Fit Plus" and "Pilotwings Resort" with the changes from "Wii Sports Resort". Also, two racetracks based on Wuhu Island appear in "Mario Kart 7", and a fighting stage based the aviation mode will appear in the upcoming "Super Smash Bros." game for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.
Reception.
"Wii Sports Resort" has received generally favorable reviews, with an average score on Metacritic of 80%. IGN gave it a 7.7 out of 10, citing the impressive fidelity of the controls and how the graphics, as compared to the majority of Wii games, were superb. "GameTrailers" gave an 8.6 out of 10. "GameSpot" gave it an 8.0 out of 10. "Edge" magazine gave it a 6 out of 10. On 1UP.com, the average score between the editors reviews and users was an 'A-.' GamesRelay gave the game a score of 8.2, citing it to be a fun loving game for family and friends. SPOnG.com's Tim Smith awarded the game 90%, calling "Wii Sports Resort" and the MotionPlus peripheral "simple but welcome additions to the Wii's line-up". X-Play stated that "You'll have a good time playing solo, but the real fun begins when more people join in on the action" and that it applies to all the events.
In May 2010 the American Heart Association (AHA) endorsed the Wii to encourage sedentary people to take the first step toward fitness. The AHA heart icon covers the console itself along with two of its more active games, "Wii Fit Plus" and "Wii Sports Resort". Nintendo Power listed "Wii Sports Resort" along with its predecessor "Wii Sports" as being two of the greatest multi-player experiences in Nintendo history, stating that everyone can have fun with them, ranging from young children to grandparents. They also cite the wide range of sports available.
Sales.
In Japan, "Wii Sports Resort" sold over 514,000 copies in two weeks. In North America it sold over 500,000 copies in its first week. As of August 8, 2009, the game has sold over 600,000 copies in Europe. Nintendo announced on August 25, 2009 that they had sold over one million units of the game in the United States, Japan and Europe individually. In September 2009, "Wii Sports Resort" sold 442,900 units.
In 2009, it sold 7.57 million copies, making it the world's second biggest selling game of that year. As of March 2013, "Wii Sports Resort" has sold 31.89 million copies worldwide.

Arniston House

Arniston House is a historic house in Midlothian, Scotland, near the village of Temple. This Georgian mansion was designed by William Adam in 1726 for Robert Dundas, of Arniston, the elder, the Lord President of the Court of Session. The western third of the house was added by John Adam, brother of Robert Adam, in 1753.
History.
The Arniston Estate lands were a royal hunting park in the Middle Ages, and were later owned by the Knights Templar, who gave the village of Temple its name. The estate came into the Dundas family in 1571, when they were bought by George Dundas of Dundas Castle. He left the estate to a younger son, James, who built a house and a walled garden here around 1620. The estate was expanded, and improvements were made by James' grandson Robert Dundas (d.1726) in the late 17th century. His son Robert, later the Lord President, continued the improvements, and built the present house.
Robert Dundas (1685–1753) was a lawyer and politician. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland from 1717 to 1720 and as Lord Advocate from 1720 to 1725. He was also a Member of Parliament from 1722 to 1737. In 1726, he commissioned the architect William Adam to design a new house at Arniston. Adam was then working on Sir John Clerk's nearby house at Mavisbank, but Arniston was to be a somewhat larger house. It was built over the foundations of the original 17th-century house, but Dundas ran out of money during the building works, which were only completed after 1753. By this time, William Adam was dead, and the design for the western part of the house was provided by his eldest son John Adam (1721–1792), for Robert Dundas' son Robert Dundas, of Arniston, the younger (1713–1787). 
In 1872, a new entrance hall was added to the north front by the architects Wardrop and Brown. The house is still occupied by members of the Dundas family who, in the summer months, open the house to the public and lead guided tours.
Architecture.
The house is of three storeys over a basement. The entrance front of the house faces north, and comprises nine bays. The central bays have a colossal order of Ionic columns, topped by a pediment, while the outer two bays at each end stand slightly forward. Pavilions, connected by diagonal corridors, flank a forecourt to the north, into which the 19th-century entrance hall projects. The south, garden front, is plainer, having a pediment but no columns. The Royal coat of arms of Scotland in the pediment may have come from Parliament House in Edinburgh, which was rebuilt at the beginning of the 19th century, around the same time that the porch and stair were added. Overall, the design of the house shows the influence of James Gibbs, and particularly his Down Hall, Essex.
The most significant interiors are William Adam's two-storey, galleried saloon, with decorative plasterwork by Joseph Enzer, and the Rococo dining room and drawing room, by the Adam brothers. There are family portraits by Sir Henry Raeburn and Allan Ramsay.
Park.
William Adam designed a semi-formal park around the house, building on the late-17th century formal landscape. This was gradually changed during the 18th century to a more informal layout. The landscape gardener Thomas White (1736–1811) planned a new park in 1791, in the informal style of Capability Brown, and planting continued into the 19th century. A 19th-century formal garden occupies the site of the 18th-century "wilderness garden".

Wales UFO sightings

The Wales UFO sightings were unexplained UFO sightings across South Wales, United Kingdom in June 2008.
Summary.
At 00:40 AM, June 8, 2008, a South Wales Police helicopter with three experienced crew onboard was above MOD St Athan, an RAF base, waiting to land in order to refuel. The Control Tower from the nearby Cardiff International Airport had recently given the helicopter clearance to do so as they had no reports nor radar evidence of any other craft in the vicinity.
Whilst awaiting permission to land and hovering above the air base at a height of about , the crew noticed a brightly lit object above them. The crew described it as "flying saucer shaped". Then suddenly, the object hurtled down towards them at "great speed." The pilot quickly took evasive action, banking the aircraft sharply. The object then sped away and the helicopter crew decided to give chase.
They pursued the object at close to the helicopter's maximum speed out over the Bristol Channel until, not far from the North Devon Coast, their fuel level, which was the main reason they happened to be above the RAF base in the first place, became critical and they were forced to give up the pursuit.
While the helicopter was equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance equipment, the object was not captured on film. The crew have since stated that the object could not be seen with night vision goggles but was "clearly visible" to the naked eye.
The object was also sighted by George Withrington, a retired RAF glider pilot from St Mellons, Cardiff. He reported seeing something "Peculiar with lots of flashing lights" later that same day while reading in his garden at about 16:20 on June 8.
"I was looking at an aeroplane overhead when I spotted this thing that was in the corner of my eye. It shifted direction very quickly, in the blink of an eye. I looked at it for quite a while, I was watching it for at least 10 minutes. It flew off towards the east, towards Newport."
Aftermath.
The event received wide publicity in the local and national media, including a front page column and full page spread in "The Sun" newspaper. A source for "The Sun" said:
"They crew are convinced it was a UFO. It sounds far-fetched, but they know what they saw."
A spokesman for South Wales Police said:
"We can confirm the Air Support Unit sighted an unusual aircraft. This was reported to the relevant authorities for their investigation."
and also:
"The crew are very experienced and responded in a professional manner in relation to what they saw. In today's skies, there are a wide variety of aircraft which come in a range of different shapes and sizes and in all probability, this sighting has just confirmed that one of these was in the area at the relevant time."
The Ministry of Defence has said it has "...received or heard nothing of the incident...But it is certainly not advisable for police helicopters to go chasing what they think are UFOs"
South Wales Police have officially, and vigorously, denied that the helicopter pursued the object.
At present, the incident remains unexplained.

A kshullak (or kshullaka, lit. small or junior) is a junior Digambar Jain monk. A kshullak wears two garments as opposed to a full monk who wears no clothes. Specifically a Kshullaka is a Shravaka of the highest degree at 11th Pratima.
A kshullak is sometimes referred to by the earlier title Varni, even though Varni corresponds to the seventh Pratima. 
Well known kshullakas include:
A Digambara Jain shravaka at the highest rank of 11th pratima is either a kshullaka or an ailaka. He is just one step below a full muni. His conduct is prescribed in Vasunandi Shravakachara and Lati Samhita.
A kshullaka wears a loin cloth (kaupina) and a white rectangular cloth as a wrap. An ailak uses only a loin cloth.
A kshullaka may live in a house or may be a wanderer. He may eat food placed in his palms, or from a container. He eats once a day. He may beg from a single house or from multiple ones.
A kshullaka may keep a yajnopavita and a shikha. In Jain tradition, Narada muni is assumed to be a kshullaka Jain monk.
Kolhapur in Maharashtra was also once known as Kshullakapur because of the presence of a large number of Jain monks during the Shilahara rule.

SimAnimals

SimAnimals is a life simulation video game published by Electronic Arts for the Nintendo DS and Wii console systems. It was released on January 21, 2009 in North America.  It was released on January 29, 2009 in Australia and January 30, 2009 in Europe.
Gameplay History (Wii).
Animals.
There are a variety of different animals that appear in the game. There are birds and mammals.
Code Animals.
These animals are only available with the Verasmenagerie code.
Including Code:
Plants on SimAnimals Wii.
Plants on the game all require a certain kind of care. They all need the right soil. There are six soils: dry; muddy; grassy; fresh water; polluted water; polluted muddy. No plant wants to live in polluted water, but some like fairly moss or water lilies are able to survive and grow in polluted water, although only healthy ones are in fresh water. Sometimes if the polluted water is bad enough, it makes the muddy soil next to it polluted as well, making it unhealthy for all plants needing muddy soil. In the game there are also mushrooms, which are fungi, but considered plants in the game. There are also some peculiar non-existing plants, that make ordinary animals extroadinary. Overall, there are flowers, trees, bushes, vegetables, mushrooms, weeds, water plants, those crazy plants (only found on Simanimals), and some other plants. Some plants are useful, too. Some can change the soil, like oak trees can turn soil into dry soil, and maple trees can turn soil into grassy soil. The oak tree is different from other plants, because it needs grassy soil when a sprout, and then dry soil when a sapling or mature tree. There are three stages of life for a tree in the game. First a sprout, then a sapling, and then a mature. Usually the longest living plants last a few weeks, and it takes about 15 or 20 minutes for a plant to grow mature, but that depends on the plant. Water plants usually take longer. Flowers, especially Baby's Breath, sprouts very very quickly. A tree has to be at least a sapling age to be able to knock down and turn into a log and a stump.
Extraordinary Plants.
These plants make animals that eat them extroadinary, whether in behavior or color. This list will show you the name and what they do to animals.
Areas.
There are many different areas that you unlock, as you travel deeper and deeper into the forest. In each area there are different animals you unlock, and different plants you unlock, but of course, you can have any plants or animals in an area.
Here are descriptions on each area: Snobby Manor (water, grassy soil, dry soil, muddy soil; huge lake, house, vegetable garden, paths); Grassy Glen (grassy soil, muddy soil, water; little pond, a big hill, or mountain, all grass all over except a spot, autumn trees and canyons on background); Foggy Creek (dry soil, grassy soil, water, muddy soil; little stream, foggy and misty in the air); Castle Hill (dry soil, grassy soil, water, muddy soil; has a place where beavers can build dams, which can make its river into a huge lake, there's a huge castle-like structure); Dry Gulch (dry soil, grassy soil be muddy soil and water; a desert, with a tiny little grass spot); River Ridge (grassy soil, dry soil, muddy soil, water; place where beavers can build dams, which leads to a lake instead of a river, and gives Dry Gulch water and muddy soil, there's a little waterfall); Big Rock (grassy soil, dry soil, muddy soil, water; place where beavers can make dames, where its river turns into a lake, there's a huge walk-on rock); Misty Bog (grassy soil, muddy soil, water soil and water is polluted at first; lots of little islands in a huge river-lake, there's a place where beavers can build dams, which blocks out all water, fireflies and misty fog at night); Old Orchard (grassy soil, muddy soil, water, dry soil soil and water is polluted at first; a little river, a wooden walk-on bridge); Junkyard (dry soil, grassy soil, muddy soil, water soil and water is polluted at first; huge garbage piles, with cars, cardboard, and shavings, little river, little waterfall, walk-through lined up old cardboard); Danger Woods (grassy soil, dry soil, muddy soil, water soil and water is polluted at first; has huge mountains place ends the story. There is a place where beavers can build dams, which leads to getting rid of all polluted water of the whole forest. There is also a huge train track and train tunnel, where a train part fell down, full of poisonous liquid, and fell into a little pond behind the dam place, which started all the pollution).
Medals and Unlocking.
There are many medals you earn during the game, that goes along with the environment your in. The medals you earn unlocks new plants and animals. There is also a good way to unlock animals and plants. Here is a list of medals and how you earn them, and where you earn them.
The Happy Bar.
The Happy Bar on the Wii is shown at the top of the screen. It determines whether your environment is happy, or not. When you first unlock an area, and travel to it, you will have this "face" in the middle of the bar. This "face" will give you the feeling of the area. For example if the environment is very happy, it will smile. If the environment is unhappy, it will turn on an angry face, or a frown. It will also change color. When happy, its green. When unhappy, its red. When in the middle, its yellow. When you come to an area, your job is to fill the happy bar, to make the environment happier. You can do that by simply doing what makes a happy environment, like having the animals get all their needs, and having the plants in their correct soil, and solving challenges. When you have a reward given, or have a predator eat another animal, that will give you lots of "smilies", and you will be able to fill up the happy bar to happy level. But, the way you get an unhappy environment, is to do something or have something horrible. This would include a starving animal, a plant in the wrong soil, or an unhappy animal. This way you'll get "frownies", and it will eventually level down the happy bar to unhappy. There is also a specific kind of music that goes along to happy, and one to unhappy. There will be sad music if leveled all the way down, and beautiful friendly music when leveled all the way up.
You can also zoom and zoom out the happy bar. You click on the bar, and it will turn into a little circle, which is that face that determines happiness or sadness. However, it will still collect "smilies" or "frownies", so if your environment is getting weak, the only way to stop it is to do good deeds to the animals and plants.
Forming bonds.
The animals are your main ticket to a happy environment. Forming bonds with them, however, takes time and patience. In order to form a bond with an animal, you need to be friendly to the animal. The best way to have an animal love you, and have full trust for you, is to take some steps. First, you shall start feeding the animal one of its favorite foods. Then, you can have the animal eat from your hand (hold the food in front of the animal, have it sniff it, and it will grab it from you), and then, when earned by enough trust, you can play with the animal, or pet the animal by waving your hand over it. Eventually, you will have full trust for the animal, and you can put it in your backpack. And of course, there is a way for the animal to hate you. The first step is to feed it something it does not like, constantly, then pick it up and throw it. Then if it still does not hate you, then you can probably try to rescue an animal it was trying to prey on, if it was a predator. If a herbivore, keep feeding it unpleasant foods and keep throwing it. Eventually, it will hate you, and a symbol of a broken heart will pop up on the screen. At that point, the animal will keep running away from you, and be thrightened by your presence. If you scare it enough, it will attack you. For example, little herbivores will bounce on you and hit you. Rabbits will kick you with their big hind feet. Skunks will spray you. Porcupines will poke you. Opossums might play dead to you. Hedgehogs might roll up in a ball at you. And the wolves and bears will chew you up and throw you in the air. This will make the animal angry. If the animal is angry enough, or treated to badly, it will move out. Moving in is when the animal loves you, or is just born. That means the animal will love to live in the area, but if you or itself brings it to another area, it might instead move there, rather than the previous loved place. There are several symbols which show you how much the animal likes you. Broken heart for hate, question mark for it does not know you, but does not hate you, one heart means trusts a little, two hearts mean it trusts you, and three hearts mean it loves you for life. However, you can have an animal that hates you love you again, or have an animal that loves you, and have it eventually hate you. The animal will struggle and make ugly noise when picked up if it does not know you, hate you, or has only one heart trust. Once you get to two hearts trust, it will trust you enough so it will be calm when you hold it, and will enjoy being thrown, as if it were a ride of somesort. Also, waterfowl, herons, beavers, and wolves seem to love having you to drop water on them, and you can gain their trust like that, even if it does not know you. Continuing to do that gain trust. However, other animals do not like water.
Animal behavior.
Animals are able to breed in the game, at least some of them are, to give birth to one young. The animals that cannot give birth to young, or cannot mate, are all birds, cats, dogs, and mice. All other animals are able to. The ones that mate the most are deer, rabbits, and rats. However, raccoons are usually very hard to breed, often being picky about whom to mate with. To have an animal mate, the first step is to have at least one heart trust for both the male and the female. Next, one needs to introduce them, by picking one of them up, and then take it over to the other animal, where when the other animal highlights, then drop the other animal. Then they will sniff at each other. Then do it again, and they will play together. Keep doing it until full trust. When at full trust, wait until they both feel like they want to mate, and then put them next to each other, and they will mate. Some beautiful music will form, while the two animals are sniffing and nudging each other with their noses. And then a few seconds later, a cloud opens on the underpart of the female, and outcomes a little cute baby. When first born, they will be frightened, and may fight with their parents, but then they will be calm, and the mother or father will lick them and nuzzle them. Beware, when they are born, they move in, but do not trust you. If you try to pick up a newborn and carry it away, the mother and father will follow and chase after you. If they catch up, they will force you to drop the baby, and the parents will fight with you, and might lose trust with you. If you have multiple players, while one is being attacked, another player can pick up the one hurting the other player. Then it will lose trust with that one other player.
The animals in the game also go into different homes. However, deer, boars and wolves are mainly the mammals that do not go into any shelter. A wolf pack, boar family, or deer herd will just sleep together. Burrows, logs, stumps, tree holes, mature trees, pile-o-sticks, mature bushes, and dams are all forms of homes or shelters. Burrows are home to badgers, foxes, rabbits, skunks, mice, and rats. Mice and skunks often fight other animals for burrows. Logs and stumps are home to raccoons, porcupines, and bears. Sometimes cats and dogs go in their for safety, but sometimes sleep outside on the ground. Tree holes are home to weasels, squirrels, and sometimes rats, if the rats want better protection to their families. Dams are only home to beavers, even though sometimes if dams are not available, beavers will live in logs. Pile-o-sticks (dead bushes) are homes for small rats and mice, and sometimes weasels. Mature bushes are used by mice and rats for safety. Mature trees are obviously a place where birds sleep and play, but they never build nests in the game. Animals in the game can make their own burrows or dams. If they build it, its their home. An animal can also move in a shelter to use it as a home, or take up residence in another animal's home, by sniffing it. Then it becomes its home. Also, sometimes, an animal will just go in there for safety, without the shelter being its home. But often when it is some other animal's or animals' home, an animal that just goes in their, without making it its home will just pop out, and run away, especially when a herbivore goes in a predator's home. Beavers create their dams by using sticks. One can give a building beaver a stick, by getting one from other wood, or a beaver would get them on their own, by knocking down a tree, and using the stump and the log and chew sticks out of it, unless it finds a fallen log or stump. It will also use bushes, as well. If a beaver wants to build a dam, a Simanimals symbol of stick, will appear above the animal's head, and that means it needs a stick. A beaver will only build a dam if it is moved in, and loves you. And, there are certain places that a beaver is able to build a dam in. These places are found in River Ridge, Castle Hill, Danger Woods, and Misty Bog. If an animal builds a home, or takes up residence of a home, and then mates, the mate and baby will then have the same home.
Foxes in this game are mischievous, and will sneak up and wake up any sleeping animals. Hedgehogs will roll into a ball when frightened. Porcupines will use its quills against predators. Bears will swat and growl at the porcupine after being poked. Skunks will spray if threatened. Bears will hold their paws over their noses. Wolves will do the same thing, only in a sitting position, and whining like a puppy. Skunks' spray looks pinkish and forms into like a ball of colored air in the air. Opossums will play dramatically dead when threatened by herons or other predators. Wolves will howl. Foxes will bark. Widgeons squeak. Ducks quack. Swans and geese honk. Mice and rats will squeak. Squirrels make very silly sounds. Herons make an angry noise. Skunks make high pitched and low pitched sounds. Beavers make sounds as if they were like "okay already", after dropping them. When dropping a weasel, it will sound like "thump, thump". Cats have different meows. Dogs bark. Dogs, bears, and wolves will play fetch with you, as long as it has full trust for you. A dog with wag and chase its tail, and a bear or wolf would stick out its tongue and wiggle its butt or tail, while arching down its back, with the head touching the forepaws. They will do this in front of a stick. Then you pick up the stick, and throw it. To start a game of fetch, drop the stick on a highlighted dog, wolf, or bear. Bears will pull sticks out of a beaver dam, which drives beavers crazy.
Also, sometimes animals can form bonds with each other. You can introduce them together, so they will gain their trust together. If a family member it will have full trust already, however, for a relative. If the animals fight with each other, or one of them is mean to the other, they will lose trust with each other, and may start to hate each other. If a predator attacks a prey, and you save the prey, they will lose trust with each other as well.
Cheat Codes.
The entire game has a total of 7 different cheat codes, all of which displayed here.
The following animals are unlocked by cheat code when you simply enter their name in the box.
Player abilities.
During the game, you are able to do a variety of different things. You use your hand, and can pick up just about everything. Food, plants, animals, and even water. For example, if a plant is in the wrong soil, and is getting sick, or dying, you can pick it up, even if it is a huge tree, and place it into the correct soil. You can also pick up even animal's homes. If you pick up a burrow, tree (or with a tree hole), stump, log, pile-o-sticks, or bush, the animal or animals in it will come out, but then you can set it back down, and the animal or animals can still go back in it, and have it be their home. If you place an animal in your backpack, and take it back out, the animal's home will not be its home anymore, unless it makes it its home again. Also, as soon as you unlock Big Rock, you will be able to cast a lightning bolt. On the Happy Bar, if the face is above the lightning bolt, you will be able to cast one. You will not have it on the Happy Bar until you reach the power to cast lightning. A lightning bolt can be formed by picking up water and holding it over water. The players holds the water over the water until a lightning spark appears (orange in color). Then the player moves it to a spot on the ground where the player wants a lightning bolt to hit, and releases it. Then a huge and tall white bolt will form, with it hitting the ground, making dust fly, and having it make very loud thunder. A lightning bolt will kill any plant under it, and will also scare any animals near it, and the animal or animals will lose trust with the player. When you unlock Castle Hill, which is the sprawn of beavers and their making of dams, the you will be able to knock down trees. You wave your hand over it, and then keep shaking it until it is uprooted and falls. When fallen, it will turn into a log and a stump. To get a stick, you wave your hand over a pile-o-sticks, a log, or a stump, and then you will be able to get several sticks, until the log, stump, or pile-o-sticks is gone. You can uproot and kill a plant by casting a lightning bolt, or waving your hand over it until. To collect food off of trees or bushes, you gently wave your hand over it, and then the food pops off all of it. You can also, if you wish, you can save an animal's life from being eaten. When you see a dustball with swirlies, that means an animal is being attacked to a hungry predator. If you wish to save it, quickly grab water from the area's river or lake, or take water from your backpack, and drop it over the dustball. Then both predator and prey will pop up, and either run away, or pick up the prey and put it in your backpack, or take it to another part of the area. It may not like it if you spray water on it, but that depends on the animal. Water birds, wolves, and beavers, however, seem to like it. You are also able to change soil, except water and dry soil, by watering the ground.
Your backpack.
Your backpack is found on the lower left bottom of the screen, and it carries several things. It can carry those crazy plants, food, water, polluted water, and animals. You can fit up to five animals in the backpack. The backpack is very useful and important. For example, you can carry animal food in it, so if you see a hungry or starving animal or animals, you can look in your backpack, and can give the animal or animals food, which will add up the Happy Bar. You can also carry bears and wolves in your backpack, to protect herbivores, or you can save herbivores by putting them in your backpack to keep it safe, and to bring it to a safer environment. It also saves the life of an animal, or a baby, if being eaten. If there is no water in the area, take water from your backpack, and spray it over the dustball. The water is also useful if you are in the desert, and there is a sprout that needs a certain soil, and that soil is not available, you can water the plant, and change the soil.
Gameplay on Nintendo DS version.
It is somewhat similar to the Wii version, but has been slightly modified. Unlike the Wii, the DS has seasons, and likewise, certain vegetables you grow will sprout up in between spring and summer. Some gameplay might cause fires in the DS version. You can play with or feed the animals by using your stylus and rubbing the screen over the animal. There are other ways that make it more lifelike. You can fish, make wind by blowing into the mic, wolves howl on full moon nights, insectivores eat insects, birds make nests with sticks, and it is strange for some predators to not always eat meat (in the Wii version, for example, owls will eat berries and nuts, and wolves will eat crotus flowers and noble fir pinecones).
Other Information.
The game has the player in the same role as in "The Sims" controlling a disembodied hand in which the player manipulates over 30 types of animals, and creates their habitat around them. The animals evolve personalities depending on how the user treats (or mistreats) them.The players can use the animals to solve challenges and achieve goals by discovering secrets, unlocking forest areas and uncovering one-of-a-kind objects and wild animals, some with special abilities, by having the animals successfully complete tasks. After a certain number of achievement points are earned in the DS version, the player can blow into the DS microphone, creating wind for the pickup of berries.The players can pick up anything in the forest including trees, flowers, other plants, animals, water, logs, and rocks.The game contains at 35 species of animals from the Northern Hemisphere. Electronics retailer Best Buy offered an exclusive in-game animal (panda, red panda, and ferret for Wii, electric squirrel for DS) with purchase during the initial US release of the game.
Reception.
SimAnimals has a score of 60% on Metacritic, which indicates mixed or average reviews, and 69% on Game Rankings. IGN gave the game a 5.3, writing, "The Sims franchise is insanely popular for a reason, and growing a community, whether it be man or animal, is rewarding. But no effort has been put into the presentation here. The game doesn't run smoothly, the forest is unattractive, and the controls aren't user-friendly."However, far from all of the reviews have been negative. USA Today awarded SimAnimals 5 stars out of 5.  Reviewer Jinny Gudmundsen wrote, "It (SimAnimals) is a fascinating experience that is hard to put down... There are many things that make this game compelling, including the outstanding graphics, music and artificial intelligence, but the most attractive feature is that the game lets you explore the delicate balances found in nature."
Soundtrack.
The music for SimAnimals was composed by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron.  The music from the game was released on January 13, 2009 as a digital download album by E.A.R.S. EA Recordings.  The SimAnimals soundtrack album was released to positive reviews and high scores, including a 9.5 out of 10 from Michael Pascua of The Celebrity Cafe, a 90 out of 100 from Jeremy Hill of Gamertell, and a 9 out of 10 from the music review site VGM Rush.

Surrogates (film)

Surrogates is a 2009 American science fiction action film, based on the 2005–2006 comic book series of the same name. Directed by Jonathan Mostow, it stars Bruce Willis as Tom Greer, an FBI agent who ventures out into the real world to investigate the murder of surrogates (humanoid remote control vehicles). It also stars Radha Mitchell, Rosamund Pike, Boris Kodjoe, Ving Rhames, and James Cromwell.
The film's main concept centres around the mysterious murder of a college student linked to the man who helped create a high-tech surrogate phenomenon that allows people to purchase remote controlled humanoid robots through which they interact with society. These fit, attractive, remotely controlled robots ultimately assume their life roles, enabling people to experience life vicariously from the comfort and safety of their own homes. "Surrogates" was released on September 25, 2009 in the United States and Canada. It was released by Touchstone Pictures.
Plot.
In the future, widespread use of remotely-controlled androids called "surrogates" allows everyone to live in idealized forms from the safety of their homes. A surrogate's operator is protected from harm and feels no pain when their surrogate is damaged. FBI agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) has a strained relationship with his wife Maggie (Rosamund Pike), due to their son's death several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies.
Tom and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell), investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed at a club. Jarid Canter (Shane Dzicek), one of the victims, is the son of Dr. Lionel Canter (James Cromwell), the inventor of surrogates. Tom and Jennifer determine that a human named Miles Strickland (Jack Noseworthy) used a new type of weapon to overload the surrogates' systems and kill their operators. After locating Strickland, Tom attempts to bring him into custody. Strickland uses the weapon and injures Tom during the chase; Tom inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone known as the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the United States). A mob of humans eventually destroys Tom's surrogate, forcing him to interact in the world without one. The Dread leader known as The Prophet (Ving Rhames) kills Strickland and confiscates the weapon.
Tom learns from Colonel Brendan (Michael Cudlitz) that the same company manufacturing the surrogates originally produced the weapon under a government contract. It was designed to load a virus that overloads the surrogate's systems, thus disabling it. Unexpectedly, the weapon also disabled the fail-safe protocols protecting surrogate operators. After the first test, the project was scrapped and all but one prototype were destroyed.
Jennifer is murdered and an unknown party hijacks her surrogate. Tom is informed that Andrew Stone (Boris Kodjoe), his FBI superior, supplied the weapon to Strickland and ordered Dr. Canter's assassination for his criticism of surrogate use. Jarid, using one of his father's many surrogates, was killed instead. The Prophet orders the weapon be delivered to Jennifer. During a military raid on the reservation led by Col. Brendan, the Prophet is shot, revealing his identity as a surrogate, with none other than Dr. Canter himself as the operator.
Tom heads to Dr. Canter's home and discovers that he has been controlling not only the Prophet but Jennifer as well. Using Jennifer's surrogate in FBI Headquarters, Dr. Canter uses the weapon to kill Stone and proceeds to upload the virus to all surrogates, which will destroy the surrogates and kill their operators. Believing his plan to be unstoppable, Canter disconnects from Jennifer's surrogate and swallows a cyanide pill. Tom takes control of Jennifer's surrogate and with the assistance of the network's system administrator Bobby Saunders (Devin Ratray), insulates the virus so the operators will survive. Tom can choose to either destroy all surrogates or simply cancel the virus upload. Tom ultimately decides to let the virus permanently shut down surrogates worldwide. People emerge from their homes without their surrogates, confused and afraid.
Tom returns home and shares an emotional embrace with Maggie in her real form. The film ends with an aerial view of the collapsed surrogates along with overlapping news reports of the downed surrogates all over the world and how people are now "on their own" again.
Production.
In March 2007, Disney acquired feature film rights to the 2005–2006 comic book series "The Surrogates" with the intent to distribute under Touchstone Pictures. The project was conceived by Max Handelman and Elizabeth Banks (Handelman's wife who is better known for her acting), and they enlisted producer Todd Lieberman to move it forward. Under Disney, Jonathan Mostow was attached to direct the film based on an adapted screenplay by Michael Ferris and John Brancato. The following November, Bruce Willis was cast to star in the lead role. Filming was scheduled to begin in February 2008 in Lynn, Massachusetts. It was delayed, beginning on April 29, 2008 in Woburn. Filming then took place in the Massachusetts cities Lynn, Worcester, Milford, Hopedale, Taunton, Lawrence, and Wayland. Visual effects were handled by Sandbox FX, Brickyard VFX, Industrial Light and Magic and Moving Picture Company.
Release.
"Surrogates" hosted its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on September 24, 2009. It was released the next day in North American cinemas by Touchstone Pictures to lukewarm reviews from film critics. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG-13 rating for "intense sequences of violence, disturbing images, language, sexuality and a drug-related scene."
Home media.
The DVD and Blu-ray was released on January 26, 2010. The Blu-ray version features four deleted scenes, a commentary by director Jonathan Mostow, and 2 featurettes. The movie has sold 713,851 units which gives it a total gross of $12,052,466 in DVD sales as of March 7, 2012.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Surrogates" was not pre-screened for critics. The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 39% of critics gave the film positive ratings, based on 112 reviews with a consensus that "Though it sports a slick look and feel, Surrogates fails to capitalize on a promising premise, relying instead on mindless action and a poor script". Metacritic gave the film an average score of 45, based on 21 critic reviews. IGN gave the film a 6.0/10, saying that "it provides a competently made, relatively predictable and slickly presented piece of genre entertainment, offering just the right amount of action beats and futuristic visuals to keep the viewer engaged without ever having an actual thought. It's good, escapist fun." Yahoo! Movies gave it a grade "C+" based on 10 reviews.
"Entertainment Weekly" Lisa Schwarzbaum concluded her positive review saying that "there's fun robot stuff, some good philosophical ideas, and a brief, nutty Willis–Ving Rhames reunion 15 years after "Pulp Fiction"". Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film 2½ stars out of 4. Ebert wrote that "while more ambitious than it has to be, the film descends into action scenes too quickly. … "Surrogates" is entertaining and ingenious, but it settles too soon for formula." He also says, "The concept, based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, would lead naturally to intriguing considerations." Some critics, however, were not too favorable to the film: Claudia Puig of "USA Today" called it "a poor substitute of sci-fi thriller saying that the tone of the movie is rarely satirical and that it's more concerned with political intrigue involving pockets of anti-surrogate protesters that enjoy bludgeoning the machines." Roger Moore of the "Orlando Sentinel" gave it a negative review, writing "watchable, but obvious… Surrogates never manages to be anything more than a poor substitute for the real thing."
Jordan Hoffman of UGO Entertainment gave "Surrogates" a B+ rating, saying it is intellectually stimulating enough to keep you intrigued while never forgetting its obligation as B movie fun. Todd McCarthy of "Variety" described it as an intense and eerily plausible science fiction thriller.
Box office.
"Surrogates" played at 2,992 theaters, where it generated $5,053,646 on its opening day. On its opening weekend, it grossed to $14,902,692, averaging $5,050 per theater, ranking #2 at the U.S. box office, behind "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs".

Soundtrack.
Surrogates: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated by composer Richard Marvin. "Surrogates" is the fifth film that director Jonathan Mostow and composer Richard Marvin have collaborated on. Marvin recorded his score with an 120-piece orchestra of the Hollywood Studio Symphony. Although it was not featured in the soundtrack, the song "I Will Not Bow" performed by Breaking Benjamin, was played during the film's ending credits, and the song's music video features footage from the film. The soundtrack was released on November 23, 2009.
