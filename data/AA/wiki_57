Hystericalady

Hystericalady (foaled April 2, 2003), is a multiple stakes winning American Thoroughbred race horse.
Background.
Bred in Kentucky by Abbott Properties, Hystericalady is the best daughter of the leading sire Distorted Humor, the sire of the dual Classic winning gelding Funny Cide. She is a daughter of 1991 Chilean champion older mare Sacramentada. A dual group I winner in her native country, Sacramentada also won the 1992 Hawthorne Handicap racing in the U.S. After producing six US-bred foals, Sacramentada returned to Chile in 2004. Sacramentada’s grandsire is Northern Dancer, therefore Hystericalady carries the blood of that sire on her top line (sire) "and" bottom line (dam).
Sold as a weanling at the November 2003 Keeneland Sales for $100,000, she was sold again as a yearling at the Keeneland Sales in September 2004 for $125,000, this time purchased by Jerry Hollendorfer (in partnership with Dr. George Tadaro and Tom Clark's Rancho San Miguel). Hollendorfer trained the filly at Golden Gate Fields Like Funny Cide, Hystericalady is a bright chestnut. With her win in the 2008 Delaware Handicap, she became the highest-earning horse to come from Northern California. In 2007, she lost by a neck to Ginger Punch in the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic.
2008 Season.
In the 2008 Azeri Stakes she went off as the 7-10 favorite. She won the 2008 Fleur de Lis Handicap by seven and a half lengths, giving up nine pounds to her rivals. In the 2008 Delaware Handicap she won by four lengths, tackling the distance of 10 furlongs for the first time in her career. Also in August 2008 she won the Molly Pitcher for the second time in back to back wins, taking it by nine lengths. In September 2008, running on a synthetic surface (on which her record stands at 0-for-5), she struggled the entire length of the stretch with the speed horse, Santa Teresita, as well as with the track and still finished second.
On October 24, 2008, in her second Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic, Hystericalady was in a dead heat with Carriage Trail for fourth place against a strong field of eight Grade I winners: Zenyatta (race day favorite at 1-2 choice), Cocoa Beach, Music Note, and Ginger Punch. Ginger Punch, who won the 2007 Distaff Cup, followed by Hystericalady, finished fifth in 2008.
Hystericalady won seven graded stakes and won 10 times on different tracks.
Changing hands.
Hystericalady was purchased for $3 million by Sheikh Mohammed during the 2008 Keeneland November breeding stock sale Nov. 3 at the Central Kentucky auction house.

Association football in Trinidad and Tobago

Association football is one of the popular sport in Trinidad and Tobago and is governed by the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association (TTFA). The FA organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams.
Football in Trinidad and Tobago.
The professional first-division league in Trinidad and Tobago is the TT Pro League, which consists of nine teams located on the island of Trinidad. The Pro League was formed in 1999 as part of a need for a professional league to strengthen the country's national team and improve the development of domestic players. The most successful club in the league has been Defence Force, who has won the league championship 22 times. The National Super League is the semi-professional second-division league in Trinidad and Tobago and contains 12 teams. The Super League was founded in 2003 to allow the best teams from association football to play in a semi-professional environment, as they prepare for life in the professional game. The amateur third and fourth divisions of six regional football associations which govern their own first and second divisions.
The Trinidad and Tobago Football Association sanctions regional tournaments that allow entry into the FA Trophy, which is the premier knockout tournament for teams in Trinidad and Tobago. The competition is open to all those affiliated with the FA. The FA Trophy is the oldest football competition in Trinidad and Tobago, dating back to 1927 and pits teams from the top three levels of the football pyramid against each other each year, similar to England's FA Cup.
International competitions.
Trinidad and Tobago are members of CONCACAF, which governs association football in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Trinidad and Tobago are also members of the Caribbean Football Union and compete in regional competitions staged by the governing body. At the club level, CFU organises an annual competition, called the CFU Club Championship, open to the champions of each Caribbean's football association first-division. Presently, the TT Pro League has two automatic qualification places given to the top 2 teams in the league standings following each season. The league champion is automatically seeded and enter the competition in the Second Round, whereas the league runner-up enter in the First Round.
As of the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League, Caribbean qualifying teams include the top three clubs from the 2012 CFU Club Championship. In the case any Caribbean club is precluded, it is supplanted by the fourth place finisher from the CFU Club Championship. Between 2008–09 and 2011–12, the Champions League was played as a twenty-four team tournament with a preliminary round, followed by a sixteen-team group stage (four groups of four), followed by an eight-team home-and-away single-elimination tournament. In early 2012, CONCACAF announced a new format for the 2012–13 edition of its Champions League. Under the new format, the preliminary round would be eliminated, and group play would consist of eight groups of three teams each, with each group winner advancing to the quarterfinals.
Players abroad.
Since the early 1990s, many Trinidad and Tobago men have found opportunities playing football at the highest levels of foreign leagues. Among the first players from Trinidad and Tobago to become regulars in foreign leagues were Dwight Yorke at Aston Villa and later Manchester United in England, Leonson Lewis at Académica de Coimbra in Portugal, and Brian Haynes at FC Dallas in the United States.
The following is a list of Trinidad and Tobagonian playing in foreign leagues:
National teams.
The Trinidad and Tobago men's and women's national soccer teams represent Trinidad and Tobago in international competition. The men's national team competes in the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Confederations Cup, in addition to the CFU Caribbean Cup, CONCACAF Gold Cup and other competitions by invitation. The women's national team competes in the FIFA Women's World Cup, and the Summer Olympics, in addition to the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup and other competitions by invitation. 
In recent years, the men's national team have been the most successful in the Caribbean and have won the CFU's Caribbean Cup 8 times since it was founded in 1990. By claiming the Caribbean Cup in 1989, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001, Trinidad and Tobago have qualified for the CONCACAF Gold Cup more than any other Caribbean nation. Though the national team have never claimed the Gold Cup title, their best finish came in the 1973 CONCACAF Championship when they finished runners-up to Haiti. The Trinidad and Tobago women's national team competed in their first international match in 1991 with a 3-1 victory over Mexico. The women's team have yet to qualify for the FIFA Women's World Cup with their best performance in the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup coming in the 1991 when they finished in third place.
In addition to the Trinidad and Tobago national team, the island of Tobago also has an official football team that represents the island. The team is not affiliated with FIFA, CONCACAF, nor the CFU and as a result may not enter any of the organisation's football competitions.

Karl Yoneda

Karl Gozo Yoneda (, 1906 – 1999) was a Japanese American activist, union organizer, World War II veteran and author. He played a substantial role in the founding of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.
Early life.
Born in Glendale, California in 1906 to Japanese immigrants, Hideo and Kazu. In 1913, Yoneda's father, now diagnosed with tuberculosis, took the family to Japan to live in their native village just outside Hiroshima. His father died two years later, leaving his mother to raise him and his two sisters.
After World War I, Yoneda went to high school in Hiroshima. When he was 15, he organized a strike among the delivery boys of the powerful "Chugoku Shimbun" newspaper. The company had increased the delivery routes without increasing pay. 
Such experiences led Yoneda to progressive ideas. He began reading the works of anarchists and socialists such as Karl Marx, Engels, Kropotkin, Bakunin, and the blind anarchist poet Vasili Eroshenko, whom he hitch-hiked to meet in Beijing when he was 16 years old. He stayed with Eroshenko two months and went back to Japan. There, he participated in workers strikes and began publishing a journal for poor farmers, "Tsuchi". For that, he was beaten and thrown into jail.
Activist life in the U.S..
In 1926, Yoneda returned to the U.S. rather than be drafted into the imperial army. On entering the U.S., although he was an American citizen carrying his birth certificate, he was detained at the Immigration Detention House on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay for two months. 
He changed his name to Karl to honor Karl Marx and began working as a dish and window washer in Los Angeles for $5 a day. He became involved with the Communist Party and the Los Angeles Japanese Workers Association. About that period, he wrote:
I was a young dreamer back then, you know, the utopian type. The Plaza was my very first experience with mass demonstrations. It was easy to go over there because you felt like you were with your own kind of people--no dressed-up people there, nobody was wearing neckties.
When Japan invaded China in 1929, he went back to Japan to protest against the invasion. Marching with the most militant groups, he narrowly escaped being arrested and returned to the U.S. 
At a march in Los Angeles in 1931, the police "Red Squad" beat him up severely and threw him in a cell. The chief called Elaine Black, whom the police called the "Red Angel" for her work in helping strikers, rushed over, bailed him out, and took him to a hospital, saving his life. The couple soon fell in love. They could not get married, however, because of California's Anti-miscegenation laws. They borrowed money for a ticket to Seattle, where they were married in 1935. 
They participated in the largest demonstrations in the city's history. In 1933, after he spoke out against the tactics of the Red Squad before the L.A. City Council, the squad caught him in an elevator and gave him the worst beating of his life. During his three-month recovery, Elaine went to San Francisco to work for the International Labor Defense group. He was offered the job of editing the Japanese Communist publication "Rodo Shimbun" and moved to San Francisco to take it. 
In May, 1934, they helped organize and participate in a longshoremen's strike in San Francisco. The bosses and police, determined to stop the strike, opened fire on the strikers, killing two and wounding several others. In 1938, Karl went to Washington State to help organize Alaska cannery workers.
World War II and after.
In 1942, Karl, Elaine, and son Tom were interned at Manzanar. Karl had registered for the draft and joined the army in November. He served in the United States Military Intelligence Service as a Japanese language specialist in China, Burma and India. He served valiantly and was decorated several times.
After the war, Elaine and Karl continued to work throughout their lives for the unions and anti-war efforts. His mother had survived the atom bomb. In 1960, they visited her on the occasion of attending a peace conference in Tokyo. 
After he retired in 1972, he continued to organize and work for human rights. He lectured, wrote articles and an autobiography, and kept his membership in the Communist Party. His wife died in 1988, and he died in 1999.

Trinity Episcopal Church (Melrose, Massachusetts)

The Trinity Episcopal Church is a historic church at 131 W. Emerson Street in Melrose, Massachusetts. The main church building was constructed in 1886 to a design by Boston architect Charles Brigham. It is connected to its parish house, built in 1936 with a significant addition in 1956. The main building is English Revival (Tudor) in styling. Its walls are made of multiple colors of granite, and are topped by a steeply pitched slate roof. There is a large projecting gable section on the southern facade, which, along with the tower in the southeastern corner, has the half-timber styling typical of the Tudor Revival. The eastern facade has a projecting curved section, which houses the apse on the interior; it is from this section that the church is connected to the parish house via the somewhat utilitarian 1956 addition. The parish house was designed in Shingle Style by Boston architect and parish member William H. Smith, although with sympathy to the Tudor styling of the church.
The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

<doc id="18425512" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18425512" title="Serbs of Montenegro">
Serbs of Montenegro

Montenegrin Serbs () compose the second largest ethnic group in Montenegro (28.7% of country's population), after the Montenegrins. In historiography, the Orthodox people of Montenegro were called Serbs. In the constitutions of the Principality of Montenegro and Kingdom of Montenegro, the Montenegrin people's ethnonym was "Serbs". With the formation of socialist Yugoslavia, the censuses showed a majority of people declaring as "Montenegrins".
History.
Middle Ages.
Slav raids on Eastern Roman territory are mentioned in 518, and by the 580s they had conquered large areas referred to as "Sclavinia". According to Byzantine sources, Serbs lived in a region in the Western Balkans in areas which were organized into "župa", an administrative division held by a "župan". Early polities include Paganija, Zachumlje, Travunija with Konavle, Duklja, and "Serbia" with Bosnia. Višeslav (fl. 768-814), the first known Serbian monarch by name, ruled the counties of Neretva, Tara, Piva, and Lim; he managed to unite several more tribes into what would become the Serbian Principality. According to the Royal Frankish Annals, in 822, Serbs inhabited the greater part of Dalmatia ("Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur"). Prince Vlastimir united Serbia in wake of the growing threat of the Bulgars, and his realm spanned over southwestern Serbia, much of Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia. Prince Petar Gojniković defeated Tišemir of Bosnia, annexing the valley of Bosna. He then expanded along the Neretva, annexing the Narentines, where he seems to have come into conflict with Michael Višević, a Bulgarian ally and at the time ruler of Zahumlje (with Trebinje and most of what would later be Duklja). Višević heard of the possible alliance between Serbia and the Byzantines, and warned Symeon. Symeon defeated Petar and in the following years there was a power struggle between the Bulgars and Byzantines over Serbian overlordship. Prince Časlav Klonimirović ruled over a confederacy of statelets covering an expansive area, uniting the tribes of Bosnia, Herzegovina, Old Serbia and Montenegro (incorporated Pagania, Zahumlje, Travunia, Konavle, Bosnia and "Rascia" into Serbia, ι Σερβλια). He took over regions previously held by Michael, who disappeared from sources in 925. According to some sources, Časlav's 'state' was based from the hinterland of Kotor.
With a Byzantine annexation of Serbian territories, the county of Duklja becomes the seat of the Serbian state. The Serbian diplomatic mission whose arrival in Constantinople in 992 was recorded in a charter of the Great Lavra Monastery written in 993, was most likely sent from Duklja. Jovan Vladimir had his court centered in Bar on the Adriatic coast, and had much of the Serbian "Pomorje" ('maritime') under his control, including Travunia and Zachlumia. His realm may have stretched west- and northwards to include some parts of the "Zagorje" ('hinterlands', inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Cedrenus calls his realm ""Trymalia" or "Serbia"", according to Radojicic and Ostrogorski, the Byzantines calls "Zeta" - Serbia, and its inhabitants Serbs.
Around 1034, the Serbs retaliated against the Byzantines under the leadership of Stefan Vojislav, a "Travunian Serb" and archon of "Dalmatia, Zeta, and Ston", possibly kin to Jovan Vladimir. He organized a revolt during a Byzantine succession, and was captured in 1036, though escaped jail in Constantinople in 1038 and returned to his lands, where he instigated another revolt and managed to defeat strategos Theophilos Erotikos (1039), strategos Michaelus Anastasii (1042), and Byzantine ally Ljutovid of Zahumlje (1043), and ruled independent until his death in 1043.
Principality of Montenegro / Kingdom of Montenegro (1852-1918).
According to "paragraph 92" in the code of Prince Danilo (1855), the Montenegrin people were ethnic Serbs and Eastern Orthodox by faith, and also "part of the Serb nation".
Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941).
Montenegro saw independence under the House of Petrović-Njegoš, firstly as a principality and then as a kingdom. Both Kingdoms fought together as independent states in the Balkan Wars and in the First World War. At the end of the war in 1918 tensions arose between the two states as the Montenegrin Whites with Serbian support deposed Nicholas I of Montenegro and proclaimed Montenegro's unification with Serbia as part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed into Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929), while the Montenegrin Greens opposed it. The conflict led to the Christmas Uprising, in which the Whites with support from the Serbian army defeated the Greens. During the period of the monarchic Yugoslavia, ruled by the Serbian dynasty of the House of Karađorđević, the tensions between Serbs and Croats were increasing and most of the Montenegrin politicians supported the Serbian proposed centralised state.
World War Two and Socialist Yugoslavia (1941-1992).
During the Second World War both Serbs and Montenegrins were very active in both resistance movements, the Yugoslav Partisans and the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland known as the Chetniks. At the end of the war the socialist Yugoslavia was created and the two became republics within the Yugoslav federation.
Yugoslav Partisan Milovan Djilas described himself as a Montenegrin Serb and described Montenegro as the spiritual homeland of Serbs, saying "I am not a Montenegrin because I am a Serb, but a Serb because I am a Montenegrin. We Montenegrins are the salt of the Serbs. All the strength of the Serbs is not here Montenegro but their soul is." Djilas also has said "The Montenegrins are, despite provincial and historical differences, quintessentially Serbs, and Montenegro the cradle of Serbian myths and of aspirations for the unification of Serbs.".
Serbia and Montenegro (1992-2006).
After the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia in 1991 and 1992, SR Montenegro held the Montenegrin referendum in 1992 which ended with a 95.96% of votes in favour for a state union with Serbia and with the changing of the socialist political system towards a pluri-partidarian one, the country was renamed into Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this period between 1990 and 1998 Montenegro was ruled by Momir Bulatović who had close relations with the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević and who was very supportive to keep close ties between the two republics within the state union. Montenegro was also included by the economic sanctions imposed to Serbia during the 1990s. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia both Serbia and Montenegro suffered the attacks of the NATO forces and several targets inside Montenegro were also bombarded. All this contributed to the rise in power in Montenegro of Milo Đukanović who was known to be much less sympathetic towards the Serbo-Montenegrin ties and would became an open supporter of the independence of Montenegro. In 2006, six years after the fall of Milošević in 2000, and after insisting on international diplomacy, the former Yugoslavia became known as the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. The process of becoming a single state union ironically lead to the separation of the two states - a change which was officiated by the referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate. Of them, 230,661 votes or 55.5% were in favour of independence and 185,002 votes or 44.5% were against.
Independent Montenegro (2006- ).
Since independence, the Montenegrin society has been divided among many issues. The independence supporters are advocating for the creation of a separate Montenegrin language, regarded before as a dialect of the Serbian language, including the creation of a new Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet which is basically the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet with the addition of two new letters. The Serbian population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they are opposed to the separation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church from the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Montenegrin language lacks ISO code, and the Montenegrin Orthodox church is canonically unrecognized.
The links between the two nations remains strong, and the fact that for the last two centuries a great number of Montenegrins had emigrated to Serbia further strengthens the ties. The Montenegrin littoral is still the main turistic destination for citizens of Serbia, and a large population of Serbians own property in Montenegro. Many of these properties consist of summer homes, and contribute to a seasonal influx of Serbs in Montenegro, during the summers. Despite the geopolitical separation, the economic balance and relationship shared between the two countries continues to be strong.
Demographics.
According to the 2011 census, Serbs are second larget ethnic group and constitute 28.7% of population of Montenegro. They are absolute majority in three and relative majority in another three municipalities, and constitute less than 20% of population in only four out of total 21 municipalities in the country. Percentage of Serbs in municipalities of Montenegro is as follows:
Serbs in Montenegro speak the Ijekavian accent of the Serbian language; some 42.9% of the population of the country speak Serbian as their mother tongue, including 37% of the declared Montenegrins. Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until 2007 when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, Montenegrin language was made the sole official language of the country and Serbian was given the status of a recognised minority language along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian.
Religion.
The Serbs are adherents of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the strongest religious institution of Montenegro (with a total of 460,383 followers or 74%). One of the largest places of worship is the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ in Podgorica.
The Serbian Orthodox Church has been threatened in Montenegro. The newly formed Montenegrin Orthodox Church has claimed all Serbian Orthodox churches in Montenegro and is backed by a small percentage of all Orthodox Christians in Montenegro. The government has recognized the church, however none of the Eastern Orthodox churches have. The leader is the controversial Miraš Dedeić, a former Serbian Orthodox clergyman with Serbian nationalist views that after being suspended from the Serbian Church, went to Rome and became a Greek Orthodox clergyman. He was later suspended by the Serbian Orthodox Church after committing adultery with a younger woman. In 1997 he was excommunicated by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople from the Eastern Orthodox Church. Montengrin Orthodox Church's leader is anathemized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and banished from Orthodoxy.
Culture.
Folk attire.
The Montenegrin cap is a traditional hat for ethnic Serbs in Montenegro and in later times the self identifying Montenegrins, originally in the shape of a flat cylinder, having a red upper surface (called "tepeluk") not dissimilar to the Herzegovina and Lika caps. It was wholly red until Prince-Bishop Petar II Petrović Njegoš surrounded it with a black rim (called "derevija"), and the definition given was as a sign of grief of occupied Kosovo. The Kosovo Myth was very popular in the old Montenegrin state. The enforcement of the cap upon the Montenegrin chieftains by Prince-Bishop Peter II Petrović-Njegoš was a mark of expression of then's dominating Serbian national identity. The national telling recorded the most often version of the cap as following: the black wrapper was sign of grief for the once big Empire, the red the bloody defeat at the Battle of Kosovo and the five small stripes on the top represent the remaining remains of the once greater Serbian realm, which became increasingly popular amongst the common folk during the reign of Prince Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš. Within the stripes is angled a six star, representing the last free part, Montenegro, shining upon the fallen and conquered. Worn by the rulers and chieftains, the version with the Four Ocil symbol in the star's place had become across the years with growth of nationalism excessively popular amongst the ordinary people, the symbol of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which effectively worked on maintaining and raising the national identity.

Free Newfoundland

]
Free Newfoundland also written as "Free NFLD" is a slogan coined by Newfoundland and Labrador cartoonist Wallace Ryan in 1982. This slogan appeared on posters around St. John's during the 1980s to encourage and promote Newfoundland & Labrador nationalism. In the early 1990s, an unnamed artist painted this slogan at the end of George Street in St. John's without the knowledge or permission of Mr. Ryan. Although many in the province debate the meaning of the slogan, Mr. Ryan is quite explicit when it comes to the meaning of the slogan when asked about it. "'Free Newfoundland' is without doubt, a call to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador to seek a different path than that presented to us by Confederation and that path, is independence for the province."
In the mid-1990s, Mr. Ryan licensed the slogan to Living Planet to produce a line of t-shirts with the slogan accompanied by a bright red star above appearing above it. Living Planet has gone on to produce a line of products based on this slogan from mugs to underwear. It is one of the best selling t-shirts in the history of the company.

Andy Bowen (May 3, 1867 – December 15, 1894) was an American boxer from New Orleans. His promising career was cut short due to in ring injuries suffered in a fight against Kid Lavigne in his home town of New Orleans. He was 27.
Andy Bowen was undefeated going 13-0-2 in his first 15 fights.
On April 6. 1893 Andy Bowen and Jack Burke were involved in the longest fight in history. The fight lasted 111 rounds (consisting of 3 min rounds each), it took 7 hours and 19 mins until referee John Duffy called "no contest" after both men were too dazed and tired to come out of their corners. Jack Burke broke all the bones in both of his hands and considered retiring after the fight but chose to continue competing. Andy Bowen fought a few fights afterward.
The injury that killed Andy came from when "Kid" Lavigne knocked Bowen down and he hit his head on the wooden canvas. He died the next morning having never woken up. At first Lavigne was arrested for the death of Bowen but was found to be innocent of any wrongdoing.

Robust Redhorse

The Robust Redhorse (Moxostoma robustum) is a redhorse-type fish that lives in the freshwater streams of the eastern United States. It is distinct from the Smallfin Redhorse (Ptychostomus robustus), with which it has been confused in historic records.
Taxonomy.
Using a specimen from the Yadkin River of North Carolina, naturalist Edward Drinker Cope first described the Robust Redhorse in 1870. The original specimen was lost or destroyed, and by the late 19th century, all mention of the Robust Redhorse had ceased. It was thought to be extinct until several unidentified fish specimens were collected from the Savannah River and Pee Dee River in 1980 and 1985. In August 1991, biologists with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, officially rediscovered the species when five specimens of the fish were collected in the Oconee River, and identified as Robust Redhorse.
Description.
"M. robustum" is a large, fairly long-living animal compared to other members of its family;
the fish can weigh up to and live for up to 27 years, although it averages in length and in weight. "M. robustum"'s body is thick, or "robust", its fins are rose-colored, and it has a fleshy lower lip.
Distribution and habitat.
"M. robustum" is found in the eastern United States from the Cape Fear River drainage in North Carolina and Virginia's Peedee River drainage, south to the Oconee River system, part of Georgia's Altamaha River drainage. 
They live in both rocky and silty pools or less turbulent areas of small and medium rivers, and are also found in reservoirs and other water impoundments.

Pulvinaria innumerabilis

Pulvinaria innumerabilis (cottony maple scale) is a small, flattened, brown scale insect about 1/8" long. In early summer mature females begin to secrete white, waxy, cottony-appearing egg sacs in which they lay as many as 1,500 eggs. Severely infested trees look like they are covered with strings of popcorn. 
"P. innumerabilis" can be found on all species of maples ("Acer" spp.) but have a strong preference for Silver Maple. It is also known to be able to survive on honey and black locust, white ash, "Euonymus", oak, boxelder, dogwood, hackberry, sycamore, beech, elm, willow, basswood, and poplar.
Damage symptoms.
While conspicuous, "P. innumerabilis" infestions usually have little impact on established trees. However, in large numbers they can cause premature leaf drop and twig dieback. Heavy infestations can cause leaves to turn yellow to light green and may cause stunted leaf growth.

Structured ASIC platform

Structured ASIC is an intermediate technology between ASIC and FPGA, offering high performance, a characteristic of ASIC, and low NRE cost, a characteristic of FPGA.
Using Structured ASIC allows products to be introduced quickly to market, to have lower cost and to be designed with ease.
In a FPGA, interconnects and logic blocks are programmable after fabrication, offering high flexibility of design and ease of debugging in prototyping.
However, the capability of FPGAs to implement large circuits is limited, in both size and speed, due to complexity in programmable routing, and significant space occupied by programming elements, e.g. SRAMs, MUXes.
On the other hand, ASIC design flow is expensive.
Every different design needs a complete different set of masks.
The Structured ASIC is a solution between these two.
It has basically the same structure as a FPGA, but being mask-programmable instead of field-programmable, by configuring one or several via layers between metal layers.
Every SRAM configuration bit can be replaced by a choice of putting a via or not between metal contacts. 
A number of commercial vendors have introduced structured ASIC products. They have a wide range of configurability, from a single via layer to 6 metal and 6 via layers. Altera's Hardcopy-II, eASIC's Nextreme are examples of commercial structured ASICs.

After graduating from high school, Xu became a teacher. In 1957, he was classified as a "rightist" and sent to work in a ranch in the underdeveloped northwest. In 1962, when the labor penalty was terminated, Xu stayed at the ranch as a herdsman. Due to despair, Xu even attempted to commit suicide. But his fellow ranchers, especially Grandpa and Grandma Dong and Guo Zi, give him the courage and strength to carry on. During Cultural Revolution, Guo Zi and other ranchers protect him from political persecution. In 1972, Xu marries Li Xiuzhi, a village girl who had fled the famine in Sichuan. They give birth to a son, Little Qingqing, and the family lived a carefree life. Xu was rehabilitated in 1979 and returned to his post as a teacher. In the evening when Xu meets his father at the Peking Restaurant, his heart is uneasy. He recalls his past at the ranch and his wife's trust in his returning, which consolidates his decision to stay in China. The senior Xu finally understands his son, and the two resume their kinship. After sending his father home, Xu returns to the ranch and to his friends and family.

On its completion, the building rose to , featuring 12 floors. The building serves as an office and parking garage.
This was the first office building in the Washington downtown to be fully sold as a condominium. Non-profit associations and lobbying groups like the American Educational Research Association are buying floors of the building to replace their previous brownstone town houses which are not now suitable to be modern offices.
The architect of the building was Alkridge, who designed the post modern design of the building. Alkridge was selected to design the building by NEST and Totah Venture, marketing organizations. Before 1430 K Street was built, two buildings were demolished in order for the construction of this building to take place.

Ohio State Route 135

State Route 135 (SR 135, OH 135) is a short north–south state highway in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. SR 135 travels from its southern terminus at a T-intersection with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) approximately south of the village of Lynchburg to its northern terminus in Lynchburg at a T-intersection with SR 134.
Route description.
The entirety of SR 135 is located within the western portion of Highland County. Beginning at a T-intersection with US 50 in Dodson Township, SR 135 travels to the northwest through a landscape primarily composed of farmland, with a few homes appearing along the way. After a brief westerly overlap of Anderson Road, the state route turns north, passes some patches of trees just prior to passing into Lynchburg. SR 135 bends to the north-northwest as it follows Sycamore Street through a residential neighborhood. The highway then turns west onto South Street at a four-way stop intersection, and continues through the heavily residential portion of the village through its endpoint where it meets SR 134 at a T-intersection.
SR 135 is not included as a component of the National Highway System, a network of highways deemed most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.
History.
The SR 135 designation made its debut in 1923. It has maintained the same short alignment in western Highland County throughout its history. The only change of any significance is that the route intersecting SR 135 at its southern terminus prior to the coming of US 50 was originally designated as SR 26. At its northern terminus, SR 135 has always intersected SR 134.

Joshua Hall Bates

Joshua Hall Bates (March 5, 1817 – July 26, 1908) was a lawyer, politician, and general in the Union Army during the early part of the American Civil War. He was a leading recruiter and organizer of many of the first regiments of Ohio troops who volunteered after President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms in the spring of 1861.
Birth and early years.
Bates was born on March 5, 1817 in Boston, Massachusetts. His father was physician George Bates who was a friend of Andrew Jackson, and mother was Eliza Hall.
He graduated from the United States Military Academy on July 1, 1837, and was breveted as a second lieutenant in the artillery. He subsequently served five years in the Regular army, including spending time in Florida in 1837-38 during the Seminole Wars. He was assigned to Cleveland, Ohio, during the Canada border disturbances from 1839 to 1841. After resigning his commission on July 20, 1842, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar.
On May 8, 1844 he married Elizabeth Dwight Hoadley of the New England Dwight family. Her father was Ohio politician George Hoadley (1781–1857) and brother was George Hoadly who later became Governor of Ohio. Their children were:
Civil War service.
Bates joined the Ohio state militia and became a brigadier general. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he was assigned to Department of the Sanitary Commission and served as the commander of Camp Harrison near Cincinnati. Along with two other militia generals, he helped establish Camp Dennison, a sprawling military complex north of Cincinnati. He helped organize fifteen regiments of infantry for service in the field. Believing that he was too old at age forty-four to go into combat, Bates resigned his commission as brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers on August 27, 1861, but remained active in the militia. 
As president of the Cincinnati Committee of Public Safety, Bates commanded a division when Cincinnati was threatened by Confederates forces in the summer of 1863. One of the earthwork fortifications in northern Kentucky which defended Cincinnati was named Bates Battery in his honor.
Again returning to civilian life, Bates resumed his law practice in Cincinnati. He became a member of the Ohio State Senate in 1864 and served until 1866. He was again a state senator from 1876 to 1878. He was the president of the Cincinnati Bar Association from 1881 to 1882.

Paul Baxendale-Walker

Paul Baxendale-Walker, also known under the pseudonym Paul Chaplin, is a talk show host, former lawyer and an author of legal text books. He is, together with Andrew Thornhill Q.C., the author of "The Law and Taxation of Remuneration Trusts" (Key Haven, 1997) and also the "Purpose Trusts" (1999, 2009 ed.).
Paul Baxendale-Walker was born of Anglo-Brazilian parents, but he was orphaned and grew up in a variety of Children's Homes. He got a degree in law at Hertford College of Oxford University and went on to qualify as a barrister and later a solicitor. He worked in taxation law at the Bar in Lincoln's Inn and then in various City law firms and Arthur Andersen, before establishing his "Baxendale Walker" practice in Mayfair in 1994.
In 1994, Baxendale-Walker advised the trustees on the taking of loans from a pension fund established for the benefit of employees. Unknown to him, the borrowers were fraudsters and £2,135,000 went missing. In subsequent civil proceedings, Mr. Justice Etherton found Baxendale-Walker was not guilty of dishonesty. In the course of the civil trial, it came to light that he had given a reference for an associate of the fraudsters without any proper basis for the factual assertions in the reference. As a consequence, in 2005, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal suspended him as a solicitor for three years. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision in 2007.
Baxendale-Walker was struck off the roll of solicitors by the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal on 11 January 2007, on the grounds that he had a conflict of interest in advising his clients on his own tax schemes. He subsequently claimed that the Law Society and others had conspired to put him out of business. On 18 April 2011, his claim was struck out by the High Court on the basis that it had no real prospect of success. He is currently suing the Law Society in California Federal Court for millions of dollars, arising out of what he claims to have been unlawful interference by the Law Society in his U.S. legal business.
Baxendale-Walker is the author of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) tax strategy implemented by Glasgow Rangers FC, which was (in April 2011) challenged by HMRC in a first tier tax tribunal. In November 2012, the Tribunal upheld the legality and tax effectiveness of the EBT strategy. Rangers got to keep an estimated £50 million saved by Baxendale-Walker's advice.
Paul still owns Baxendale Walker LLP, which has offices in London and Glasgow, and he regularly features on TV as an expert commentator on tax matters.
Red Zone.
He was the host of the TV discussion show Red Zone, which features political and media celebrities discussing randomly chosen subjects from "Devil Cards", without the usual time constraints of topical discussion shows.

His guests have included Boy George, Neil and Christine Hamilton, Richard Digance, Robin Bextor, Vicki Michelle, Carole Malone, Michael Cole, Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, Garry Bushell, Lawrie McMenemy, Derek Laud, Ray Santilli, and others.
Bluebird Films.
From 2005 to 2012, he owned the adult film company Bluebird Productions, and he has produced, directed and acted in a number of adult films, including the "Batman" spoof "Katwoman". He sold Bluebird in 2012, making an estimated $20 millionUSD.
Print interests.
In May 2012, he purchased "Loaded" and "SuperBike" magazines, and, in September 2012, he purchased the Paul Raymond Publications stable of magazines, including the iconic men's magazines "Mayfair", "Men Only" and "Club International".

Robert Howard (athlete)

Robert Howard (November 26, 1975 in Brooklyn, New York – August 14, 2004 in Little Rock, Arkansas) was an American world-class triple and long jumper and a nine-time NCAA collegiate champion.
High school.
Howard graduated from Shea High School in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1994. His top triple jump while competing in the high school ranks was 51-5.75 (15.69m). He received the Tom Doherty Memorial Award as the state's male athlete of the year.
Collegiate career.
In choosing a college, Howard elected to follow in the lengthy horizontal jumping tradition at the University of Arkansas, where he would follow in the footsteps of such luminary jumpers as Mike Conley, Sr., Edrick Floreal, Jérôme Romain, Brian Wellman and Erick Walder. 
Putting his own stamp on the track program, Howard won nine individual collegiate championships while jumping for Arkansas:
During this time, the Razorback team, under the guidance of legendary coach John McDonnell, itself won seven of the eight available NCAA team titles, indoors and out. 
Howard competed at the 1997 World University Games, finishing third in the triple jump. In 1997, he was named Collegiate Athlete of the Year by "Track and Field News" magazine for winning all four jumps in the two NCAA championship competitions. 
All of Howard’s personal records were set while he was a collegian:
Howard graduated from the university in 1998 with a bachelors degree in pre-medicine/microbiology.
Professional career.
In 1999, Howard missed the majority of the season with an injury. 
Howard qualified for the US Olympic team in the triple jump twice, making the finals in both Atlanta and Sydney. He finished seventh in 1996 and eighth in 2000. He won the triple jump competition at the 2000 Olympic Trials with a leap of 55-9 (16.99). His best finish in USATF competitions was a second in the triple jump in 2001.
Admitted to medical school in 1999, Howard worked in his jumping around his schooling, studying at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to be a neurosurgeon. He had deferred his medical studies for one year to train for the 2000 Olympics and again for the 2004 Olympics. He finished fifth in the 2004 Olympic Trials, falling short in his attempt to make the Olympic team for the third time.
Rankings.
During his career, Howard was ranked among the top jumpers in the US by "Track and Field News".
Death.
On August 14, 2004, shortly after his failure to make the Olympic team and in the opening hours of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Howard is believed to have murdered his wife, Robin Mitchell, a chief neurosurgery resident at UAMS, and later leapt to his death from the 10th story of a medical school dormitory. Police found Mitchell dead in the couple’s bed with multiple stab wounds.

John Freshwater

John Freshwater (born June 22, 1956) is a former science teacher at Mount Vernon Middle School in Mount Vernon, Ohio, who was dismissed by the Board of Education for teaching creationism in a public school, and using a Tesla coil to "mark the shape of the cross into the arms of eighth grade students".
Freshwater was suspended without pay and requested a public administrative hearing, which began in October 2008 and concluded in January 2011 with the hearing referee recommending the school board terminate Freshwater's teaching contract. One week later, the Board terminated Freshwater's contracts. Additionally, Freshwater was involved with two federal court cases regarding the accusations, one brought against him by the student who claimed "Mr. Freshwater burned a cross" into his arm, which was settled out of court, and in the other Freshwater sued his employers, which he later withdrew. Freshwater appealed his termination, but the appeals were denied by two different appeal courts and the Supreme Court of Ohio.
Personal life.
Freshwater taught at Mount Vernon Middle School from 1987 until he was suspended in 2008 and officially terminated in January 2011 following two years of hearings. He has a Bachelor's degree in Education from Ohio University and an Associate's degree in Recreation and Wildlife from Hocking College. He is married and has three children.
In 2011, Freshwater told "The Columbus Dispatch" he sold his home on several acres to a former student to pay his legal costs and lives with his wife and daughter in a Mount Vernon rental home.
Investigation, lawsuits, and hearing.
Investigation and school board termination hearing.
In April 2008, Freshwater publicly claimed he was told by school administration to remove a Bible off his desk, but refused. This prompted some students to hold a rally in support of Freshwater a few days later. Subsequently, the school released a statement the following week, in part, "The allegations against Mr. Freshwater are very serious. This is not about his personal Bible on his desktop. It is about the totality of his conduct." At that time, he was under investigation for preaching his religion to his students, teaching creationism, encouraging prayer and burning students with a Christian cross with an electric lab instrument. Freshwater's lawyer described the complaints as "fabrications."
In June 2008, the local school board voted unanimously to initiate termination proceedings against Freshwater after an independent investigative report concluded Freshwater preached creationism, claimed evolution is discredited and did not teach the required science curriculum. It was publicly revealed that as early as 2006, he was told to stop teaching creationism and intelligent design, but he continued to do so. In addition, the investigative report included photos of a child's arm with burn markings in the shape of a cross. The report also included the claim that several teachers complained for eleven years that Freshwater was teaching evolution incorrectly. Freshwater was also accused of shocking a special-needs student in the back after telling him to pick up a test tube, though Freshwater said he might have touched the student inadvertently as the boy walked past him. Further, it was alleged that he had used material from Answers in Genesis, Jonathan Wells' "Icons of Evolution," and Kent Hovind to cast doubt on evolution and had assigned students to see the pro-intelligent design movie "" for extra credit. According to CNN, "The report also cites evidence that Mr. Freshwater told his students that 'science is wrong because the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin and so anyone who is gay chooses to be gay and is therefore a sinner'."
In July 2008, Freshwater appealed the decision by requesting a public administrative hearing, as allowed under Ohio Revised Code 3319.16, and the school board began holding hearings in October that included testimony from students, parents, teachers, and administrators regarding the board's grounds for termination. The termination hearing, refereed by attorney R. Lee Shepherd, was sporadic with testimony being heard on nearly 40 days over the span of almost two years. At the end of the hearing, the referee would decide if the board had sufficient grounds to terminate Freshwater's contract and present the school board with a non-binding recommendation. During the entirety of the hearing procedures, Freshwater was suspended without pay.
In the hearing, both parties called medical experts to testify on the use of a Tesla coil on students. The experts only had access to the photos, but never examined the student. The board's medical expert testified that the photos of the student's arm "looked like a burn to him, specifically an electrical burn. He said if high voltage is involved, one also needs to be concerned about underlying injury." Defense witness Dr. Patrick Johnston doubted the pictures show a second-degree burn, as that would have been "excruciating" and that he would have prescribed narcotic pain relievers in a similar case. Johnston further stated that, in his opinion, if it were second-degree burns, the "parents were negligent in not taking the child to a doctor." 
The company that manufactured the device used by Freshwater has stated that it should not be used on human beings, and e-mailed written instructions to the investigators which state, “Never touch or come in contact with the high voltage output of this device, nor with any device it is energizing.” Freshwater defended his actions, stating he used an electrostatic generator to leave an "X", rather than a cross, on a student's arm as a demonstration, something he said he had done hundreds of times in the past, and that the process merely leaves a temporary red mark. Moreover, the only written instructions possessed by the schools had no such caution. Principal William White testified, "No, it does not anything about not touching people with the Tesla coil.".
The board presented a second student who testified that he was burned by Freshwater, but did not complain, and said Freshwater told a group of students that "Catholics aren't Christians." The boy said the phrase stuck with him because he is a Catholic.
The defense presented many students, however, to contradict the board's student witnesses. One student, a 15-year-old former student of Freshwater who was in the same science class in which the Tesla coil incident occurred, stated, "A student would be lying if they said John held someone's arm down on the overhead during the Tesla coil [experiment." Seven more students testified that they didn't notice a Bible on Freshwater's desk, did not recall any case in which Freshwater referred to the Bible in class and did not remember Freshwater ever talking about intelligent design or creationism in class. The students said they did not see Freshwater hold anyone's arm down as the Tesla coil was applied; they also testified that they heard no one complain or cry out in pain due to the experience."
With regard to the allegations of Freshwater's incorrect teaching of evolution, a high school teacher testified that "she had to reteach science to freshmen after they received improper instruction from eighth-grade teacher John Freshwater." She explained, "If they had been taught evolution in a scientific manner, they would not have agreed that evolution is controversial." In June 2010 the evidence that was found in Freshwater's classroom in 2008, only a few months after he was suspended, was revealed to the public. Freshwater claimed that there were "date discrepancies" and that the evidence had been tampered with.
In September 2010, while the hearing referee, R. Lee Shepherd, was deliberating, Dennis family attorney Douglas Mansfield filed an amicus brief with the referee, addressing Freshwater's claim that the Dennises are not credible witnesses. The brief states that claim is baseless, and adds, "the witnesses that testified in these proceedings confirmed that John Freshwater committed the wrongs the board alleged and did so over a lengthy period." He further noted that a federal court had determined that Freshwater is not credible.
On January 7, 2011, the referee submitted his report and non-binding recommendation to the Mount Vernon City School Board of Education. In his finding of fact regarding the Amended Resolution’s allegations of injuring students with a Tesla coil, the referee wrote, “Once sworn testimony was presented, it obvious that speculation and imagination had pushed reality aside. There was a plausible explanation for how and why the Tesla Coil had been used by John Freshwater.” He further noted that the matter had already been adjudicated by the administration in January 2008, and was not a proper subject for the Amended Resolution. He did not recommend this topic as a ground for contract termination, and this claim was not a basis for the Board’s January 2011 resolution to terminate Freshwater’s contract.
He went on, however, to recommend that Freshwater's contracts should be terminated, writing "he persisted in his attempts to make eighth grade science what he thought it should be — an examination of accepted scientific curriculum with the discerning eye of Christian doctrine." The next week, on January 10, 2011 the School Board voted 4-1 to terminate Freshwater. The process to terminate Freshwater's contract cost the School Board a total $902,765 over nearly three years. The expense caused debate about reforming the hearing process, with Republican politicians discussing the possibility of making changes.
Approximately one month after his firing, on February 8, 2011, Freshwater filed a 33 page complaint, which may also be considered an appeal, regarding the decision in the Knox County Court of Common Pleas, alleging board's actions breached the master contract, the hearing referee made errors, discrimination, creationism and intelligent design are not religions, a portion of the Ohio Revised Code provisions that deal with teacher terminations (OC 3319.16) is unconstitutional, and several other claims. In March, the School Board responded and asked United States District Court to hear the case. In April, the Court then returned the case to the Court of Common Pleas. The next week, the Rutherford Institute "announced that it will defend Freshwater in his bid to appeal the Mount Vernon City School District’s decision to fire him."
In July 2011, the Institute issued a press release that a "letter of admonishment" from Freshwater's disciplinary file was removed by Education Department because "Freshwater was not given the opportunity to defend himself before the admonishment was issued." A spokesperson for the Department said, that the letter and Freshwater's response were removed from the disciplinary file "while considering this matter."
On October 5, 2011, the Knox County court upheld the school board's decision to fire Freshwater for teaching creationism and religious doctrine in his middle-school classroom. In addition, Freshwater has to pay at least $100 in court costs. The Associated Press reported that Freshwater said in an e-mail he's reviewing his legal options.
In December 2011, Freshwater filed an appeal of the Knox County court decision in 
Ohio District Fifth District Court of Appeals with his attorney Kelly Hamilton in conjunction with the Rutherford Institute. In March 2012, the District Court of Appeals denied Freshwater's appeal, ruling "there was sufficient legal grounds for the school board to fire Freshwater" and ordered Freshwater to pay the costs of the appeal. In particular, the court ruled Freshwater "was represented by a competent attorney, he was permitted to fully explain his actions, he presented witnesses on his behalf, and he had a full opportunity to challenge the Board’s key witnesses" during the hearing.
In April 2012, Freshwater filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, seeking the court to overturn decisions by the Court of Common Pleas and the Ohio Fifth District Court of Appeals. In July 2012 the Supreme Court of Ohio agreed to hear Freshwater's appeal. The Supreme Court of Ohio heard arguments on February 27, 2013. On November 20, 2013 the Supreme Court affirmed "the judgment of the court of appeals that upheld Freshwater’s termination."
"Doe v. Mount Vernon Board of Education et al.".
On June 13, 2008, the "Doe" (pseudonym) family filed "Doe v. Mount Vernon Board of Education et al." in federal court against Freshwater and the Board of Education of the Mount Vernon City School District. The lawsuit alleged Freshwater had proselytized in class, displayed religious material (which was not for his personal use) in the classroom, and left a burn on the son's arm in the shape of a cross.
Parents of the student allegedly released a statement regarding Freshwater's claims saying, "We are religious people, but we were offended when Mr. Freshwater burned a cross onto the arm of our child." The statement continued, "We are Christians who practice our faith where it belongs, at church and in our home and, most importantly, outside the public classroom, where the law requires a separation of church and state."
In September 2008 WCMH-TV reported Freshwater filed a counterclaim saying he suffered "emotional distress, lost time from work and anxiety in his lawsuit. Plus, he wanted this case to be heard before a jury."
In August 2009, the Board of Education settled and the school board's insurance company "agreed to pay $115,000 toward the Dennises legal fees, $5,500 to Zachary Dennis and $1 each to Stephen and Jenifer Dennis." In addition, the board also agreed to provide training to administrators and teachers concerning religion and public schools.
In June 2010, Freshwater and his lawyer faced sanctions in court for not turning over documents related to the civil case. The judge also criticized Freshwater for taking a settlement offer marked "confidential" from the Dennises and reading it verbatim at a school board meeting. The judge issued a gag order due to Freshwater's actions and reprimanded Freshwater and Freshwater's attorney, R. Kelly Hamilton, for failing to turn over documents related to billing and evidence of religious items in Freshwater's class. The judge later upheld the sanctions previously issued, ordering Freshwater and Hamilton to pay plaintiff's attorney fees. In the order the judge found that “Freshwater's sworn testimony about the Tesla coil given on two separate occasions simply cannot both be true.” The Judge found "Based on Freshwater’s and Attorney Hamilton's less than forthcoming behavior, it would be a manifest injustice for Plaintiffs to be required to pay their attorneys for work necessitated only by Freshwater's and Hamilton's misconduct. Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Defendant John Freshwater and Attorney R. Kelly Hamilton."
On October 27, 2010 it was announced the case was settled and the family would receive $450,000 plus attorney fees. The settlement includes a $300,000 payment by Freshwater's insurer to Stephen and Jenifer Dennis to compensate them "for mental pain and other damages suffered" as well as a $150,000 annuity for their minor son, Zach Dennis and a $25,000 payment to Jones Day, the Dennises' attorney. As part of the settlement, "Dennis family has agreed to forego recovery of the sanctions awarded to them by the federal district judge presiding over the case." An attachment to the settlement from the family said they settled "to avoid having to put their son, Zach, and other Mount Vernon school students through the ordeal of what would likely have been a multi-week trial." John Freshwater "said he had no comment regarding the settlement."
On November 23, 2010 Licking County Probate Judge Robert Hoover approved the settlement agreement, making the case "officially settled." According to documents, settlement included "$475,000 to the Dennis family includes $25,000 for attorney fees, $150,000 each to Stephen and Jennifer, and $150,000 to be used for an annuity for Zachary."
"Freshwater v. Mount Vernon Board of Education et al.".
In June 2009, John and Nancy Freshwater filed "Freshwater v. Mount Vernon Board of Education et al." in federal court, naming school board members, the superintendent, the middle school principal, and the investigators hired by the board as defendants. The suit sought $1 million in damages for charges including violation of Freshwater's first amendment right to free speech, discrimination of Freshwater's religion, and defamation. The suit wanted Freshwater reinstated as a science teacher at the school. Freshwater's attorney explained the timing of the lawsuit - while the administrative hearing was still in progress - was compelled by the impending expiration of the statute of limitations on the defamation claim.
On August 31, 2010 the Freshwaters' lawyer, Hamilton, was ordered to pay the Mount Vernon Board of Education's lawyer fees. The judge found that, “Plaintiffs have repeatedly failed to meet their discovery obligations in this case. The fact that their attorney regards himself as over-extended does not relieve either plaintiffs or their attorney of their obligations in this litigation — which was, after all, initiated by them.”
On October 14, 2010 John and Nancy Freshwater dropped their loss of consortium claim from the lawsuit. The case was still in the discovery phase and that same week the Board's attorneys issued "a large number of subpoenas to certain individuals, various organizations and businesses."
One week later on October 21, 2010, John and Nancy Freshwater dropped the lawsuit. Sarah Moore, an attorney for the defendants, said "We are not surprised and we think it is long overdue." In a statement released on October 22, Freshwater said "he dropped a federal lawsuit over his firing so facts of his case could be aired." Freshwater said he was offered a financial settlement, but defense attorney Moore said “There was no settlement offer to accept or reject. There was no money on the table for to leave there. We were baffled when we received the e-mail from him and we can't even begin to speculate why he is saying what he is saying.”

<doc id="18426245" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18426245" title="Mitutoyo">
Mitutoyo

Mitutoyo was established on October 22, 1934. It was founded by Yehan Numata (沼田 恵範 "Numata Ehan") with one product, the micrometer. Mitutoyo's philosophy at that time was to make high-quality micrometers, but also to produce them in quantities that made them affordable and available to all of manufacturing. This philosophy was expanded in the next several decades to include a wider product offering focused on mechanical, dimensional gaging products, such as calipers, dial indicators, and other measuring tools.
As electronic technology became more widespread in the 1970s, Mitutoyo applied electronics to its line of dimensional gaging equipment to include electronic, or digital, measuring tools. During this time it also began to offer larger, more complex and more sensitive measuring instruments, including optical comparators, form measuring equipment, and coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). As statistical process control (SPC) was introduced, Mitutoyo led the world in the development of output gages, interfaces, data collectors and analysis software to take advantage of this new metrological science.
When the computer made its way into the field of metrology, Mitutoyo again shifted its focus to include this technology into its product offering and push measuring accuracies into the sub-micrometre range. Today, Mitutoyo presents its 6,000+ products as integrated, computer-based metrology systems, where they can be interconnected to form closed-loop-measuring networks.
Mitutoyo America Corporation was formed in 1963 and is headquartered in Aurora, Illinois (just outside of Chicago). Mitutoyo America offers the full product line of precision measuring tools, instruments and equipment with a distribution network, training and education classes, software development, and service support to provide a comprehensive metrology organization.
Dr. Yehan Numata is also the founder of Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK), the Society for the Promotion of Buddhism, which sponsors the Buddhist Canon Translation Project.
The company name is usually spelled in the Kunrei-shiki/Nihon-shiki manner "Mitutoyo". Because most publications for foreigners as of 2000 require the usage of Hepburn romanization, as of 2000 in the Tokyo Anglophone yellow pages the company name is rendered in the Hepburn style "Mitsutoyo".
Conviction for illegal activities.
On 14 September 2006, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted four former executives of the Mitutoyo Corporation. The company was penalized for violating the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law prohibiting the company from exporting any products for 6 months, and from exporting measuring devices for an additional 2½ years (2007-mid 2010). In addition, the Japanese court gave the former executives multi-year jail sentences (suspended) and fined Mitutoyo ¥45 million (approx. $350,000 USD). It was found that Mitutoyo created software for their products which would falsify the accuracy of the measurements taken in order to circumvent customs inspections.
There is evidence that a portion of Mitutoyo’s illegal exports helped in nuclear weapon programs in Libya, Iran, and North Korea. In particular, several Mitutoyo coordinate measuring machines were allegedly sold to Scomi Precision Engineering in Malaysia. The Scomi scandal was part of a wider arms smuggling operation masterminded by Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan.

Rotary piercing

Rotary piercing is a hot working metalworking process for forming thick-walled seamless tubing. There are two types: the Mannesmann process and Stiefel process.
Mannesmann process.
A heated cylindrical billet workpiece is fed between two convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating in the same direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are on opposite sides of the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.
Mannesmann mills can produce tubes as large as 300 mm (12 in) in diameter.
Stiefel process.
The Stiefel process is very similar to the Mannesmann process, except that the convex rollers are replaced with large conical disks. This allows for larger tubes to be formed.

Lysebotn (“bottom of the Lysefjord”) is a village of the municipality of Forsand at the end of the Lysefjord in Rogaland county in the southwest of Norway. It's a destination for over 100,000 tourists yearly, and a BASE jumping access point for Kjerag and Preikestolen (the Preacher’s Pulpit), cliff blocks precipitously high above the fjord. The village is visible at bottom center in the image below. Cruises as well as an express boat to here start at Skagenkaien in Stavanger, also from Lauvvik and Forsand, passing beneath Preikestolen.
At Lysebotn, it’s possible to take the nearby road Lysebotnvegen (county road 500, turns of which are visible at lower right in the image), to get access to the other cliff vantage point, Kjerag – but is open only in the summer, when it is ice free and safe. It continues farther on to Sirdal, first going through 27 hairpin turns up the one fjord wall, and is 29 km (18 mi.) long. The road was opened in 1984, and has its highest point 932 m. (3057 ft.) above sea level. At the top of the turns is Øygardstølen that has a parking lot, service building for trips to Kjerag, and food services.
Lyse chapel is also found at Lysebotn. This was built in 1961. Lysebotn at one time had its own school. Lysebotn today has its own campground, bed & breakfast, and tourist cabin. Guided kayak tours and other activity offerings are available during the summer. There are also trailheads near Lysebotn for access to the Lyseheiane back-country, and a huge flume for Lyse Power nearby, that generates hydroelectricity.

<doc id="18426388" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18426388" title="Public Service Association of NSW">
Public Service Association of NSW

The Public Service Association of NSW is a union which represents New South Wales Government, NSW university and related New South Wales public sector employees. The union is registered under New South Wales state legislation.
The members of the PSA are also members of the Community and Public Sector Union, which is a national union registered under Commonwealth legislation. See entry on Community and Public Sector Union.
The PSA represents members on all aspects of their working life and provides some value-added services on top of this. Members are represented collectively and individually.
History.
The first attempt to form the Association was made in April 1886 by Arthur Josling and P.H. Somerville. Their actions may have been prompted by similar moves in Victoria and by growing concerns of political patronage within the service.
The Provisional Committee set up to establish the organisation stated that the Association would not have a political character nor would it be a trade union. Thirteen years passed before the union was established in 1899.
The first edition of the Association's newspaper, The Public Service Journal, appeared on 4 January 1900 and carried the historic story of public servants meeting to consider the union's draft constitution.
The Chairman, Mr. Beauer, Clerk of the Peace, in addressing the meeting said, 
""... though we have a loyal and faithful service, we must have a fearless service. I mean a service which will not be spineless, or a cringing, craving service, which is always indicative of that which is wrong, because ultimately they would find that a service which dare not express its views in a reasonable and proper manner, and dare not ask for what was legitimately its rights, was bound, more or less, to be a menace to the State."" 
The constitution was then submitted to the Premier, G H Reid and the Public Service Board. Both parties approved of its contents. The Association's first Chairman was Mr. Cornelius Delohery with Mr. W.A. Thomson elected Secretary.
In October 1900, the first country branch was formed at Moree. Others quickly followed in Armidale, Goulburn, Hay, Newcastle, Forbes and Orange. In November of the same year, Mr. John Osbourne was appointed as the first permanent Secretary and the first Council was elected to conduct the business of the PSA.
In 1908, the Industrial Arbitration System was established in NSW. The PSA was not only excluded from that system but had its membership of approximately 3,300 fragmented by the creation of other unions such as the railways and teachers.
1910 saw the PSA's first major campaign covering equal pay, superannuation and conditions.
In 1915, it had to be decided whether to register as a trade union under the Industrial Arbitration and trade Union Acts. The proposal fired spirited debate but a referendum resulted in 670 members supporting registration with 538 votes cast in opposition. The PSA subsequently became registered as a trade Union under the trade Union Act and an Industrial Union under the Industrial Arbitration Act. Four internal divisions were established - Clerical, General, Professional and Education.
By 1920, a vocational structure was emerging - the division and representation of members by the jobs they did - and the PSA's first awards were lodged.
In 1922, new legislation again excluded the PSA from the arbitration system. In an attempt to correct this situation the PSA waged a major political campaign between 1925 and 1930 to regain access to the system. The Lang Labor Government eventually amended the legislation. Four sections then emerged - Clerical, General, Professional and Government Agencies - plus a Women's Auxiliary.
In July 1927, the Association changed the name of its newspaper from The Public Service Journal to Red Tape.
During the Great Depression years - 1930 to 1945 - the Association fought a rearguard action to protect members and conducted campaigns to maintain jobs. While job losses were minimised, the State Government slashed public servant salaries and raided the monetary resources of the State Superannuation Fund.
It was years before the Association was able to restore pre-depression salaries and was not until 1944 that the State Government repaid the money taken from the Superannuation Fund.
In 1944 the Crown Employees' Appeal Board was established. The creation of the body was one of the PSA's earliest objectives.
Somewhere between 1948 and 1953, the PSA affiliated with NSW Labor Council, now known as UnionsNSW.

Guitar Sounds from Lenny Breau

Guitar Sounds from Lenny Breau is an album by Canadian jazz guitarist Lenny Breau, first released in 1968.
History.
Breau had befriended Chet Atkins which resulted in Lenny's first two LP issues on RCA. Atkins and Breau also collaborated on "Standard Brands" in 1981. Breau was nearly ubiquitous around Atkins' office in Nashville both during and after these two RCA releases and also played clubs regularly.
Atkins was instrumental in getting Lenny his first recording contract after hearing one of his (Lenny's) studio tapes. Atkins stated in an interview for "Frets" magazine: "Paul Yandell first brought Lenny to my attention around 1966. I immediately knew that here was one of the great players of this world. He had taken some of my fragmentary ideas, and gone on and on into musical areas I had never dreamed of."
A wide range of styles are found on this release, from bluegrass to pop and jazz standards to Hank Williams and The Beatles.
The songs were recorded during two sessions under the supervision of Atkins. A technical difficulty delayed the release of the album until late winter. Breau was reportedly displeased with the track selection and sequencing, preferring the more straight ahead jazz tunes the trio had recorded versus the pop-flavored material Atkins chose to include.
Reception.
"Rolling Stone" reviewer John Burke called Breau's playing "tender" and "understated" and stated in his review: "... part of the fascination in hearing an imaginative player like Breau lies in how he reinterprets each song so that you hear it as if for the first time... Within the pop/country, rock/jazz frame he has set for himself, you feel Breau extend himself to the fullest. A handsome first effort." Music critic Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it "an impressive debut as any you're likely to find because of Breau's startling originality on the instrument."

Harvard University

Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose history, influence and wealth have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
Established in 1636 by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the "President and Fellows of Harvard College") is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.
The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Eight U.S. presidents have been graduates, and some 150 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff. Harvard is also the alma mater of 62 living billionaires and 335 Rhodes Scholars, the most in the country. The Harvard University Library is also the largest academic library in the United States.
Harvard has the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the world, standing at $32.3 billion as of June 2013. 
History.
Colonial.
Harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
It was initially called "New College" or "the college at New Towne". In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship "John of London". In 1639, the college was renamed "Harvard College" after deceased clergyman John Harvard, who was an alumnus of the University of Cambridge. He had left the school £779 pounds sterling and his library of some 400 books.
The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.
In the early years the College trained many Puritan ministers. The college offered a classic academic course based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge—but one consistent with the prevailing Puritan philosophy. The college was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches throughout New England. An early brochure, published in 1643, described the founding of the college as a response to the desire "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches".
The leading Boston divine Increase Mather served as president from 1685 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman, which marked a turning of the college toward intellectual independence from Puritanism.
19th century.
Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties. When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas).
In 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' "participation in the Divine Nature" and the possibility of understanding "intellectual existences". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to "soar with Plato" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the "official philosophy" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.
Charles W. Eliot, president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.
20th century.
During the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the undergraduate College expanded. Radcliffe College, established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.
James Bryant Conant (president, 1933–1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting "Report", published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.
In 1945–1960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool. No longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics or Asians.
Women remained segregated at Radcliffe, though more and more took Harvard classes. Nonetheless, Harvard's undergraduate population remained predominantly male, with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe. Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States. Harvard's graduate schools, which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college, also became more diverse in the post-World War II period.
In 1999, Radcliffe College, founded in 1879 as the "Harvard Annex for Women", merged formally with Harvard University, becoming the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
21st century.
Drew Gilpin Faust, the Dean at Radcliffe, became the first woman president of Harvard in 2007. Her appointment came after Lawrence Summers resigned his presidency in 2006 when his comments about the causes of gender demographics in academia—made at a closed academic conference—were leaked to the press.
Campus.
Harvard's main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, about west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university, academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall, Memorial Church, and the majority of the freshman dormitories. Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses, nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. The Harvard MBTA station provides public transportation via bus service and the Red Line subway.
The Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston. The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses. The Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately southwest of downtown Boston and south of the Cambridge campus. A private shuttle bus connects the Longwood campus to the Cambridge campus via Massachusetts Avenue making stops in the Back Bay and at MIT as well.
Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library. The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness.
Radcliffe Yard, formerly the center of the campus of Radcliffe College (and now home of the Radcliffe Institute), is adjacent to the Graduate School of Education and the Cambridge Common.
From 2009–2011, Harvard University reported on-campus crime statistics that included 69 forcible sex offenses, 12 robberies, 15 aggravated assaults, 80 burglaries, and 10 cases of motor vehicle theft.
Satellite facilities.
Apart from its major Cambridge/Allston and Longwood campuses, Harvard owns and operates
Arnold Arboretum, in the Jamaica Plain area of Boston;
the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, in Washington, D.C.; the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts; the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts and the Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy. Harvard also operates the Harvard Shanghai Center in China.
Major campus expansion.
Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Allston, a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge, with the intent of major expansion southward. The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge. Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram. Plans also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive (at Harvard's expense) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River, as well as the construction of bike paths, and buildings throughout the Allston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.
One of the foremost driving forces for Harvard's pending expansion is its goal of increasing the scope and strength of its science and technology programs. The university plans to construct two 500,000 square foot (50,000 m²) research complexes in Allston, which would be home to several interdisciplinary programs, including the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and an enlarged Engineering department.
In addition, Harvard intends to relocate the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard School of Public Health to Allston. The university also plans to construct several new undergraduate and graduate student housing centers in Allston, and it is considering large-scale museums and performing arts complexes as well. Unfortunately the large drop in endowment has halted these plans for now.
Endowment.
Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011, it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012, Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.
Academics.
Teaching and learning.
Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929. The university offers 46 undergraduate concentrations (majors), 134 graduate degrees, and 32 professional degrees. For the 2008–2009 academic year, Harvard granted 1,664 baccalaureate degrees, 400 masters degrees, 512 doctoral degrees, and 4,460 professional degrees.
The four year, full-time undergraduate program comprises a minority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction with an "arts and sciences focus". Between 1978 and 2008, entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration. Since 2008, undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and United States in the World. Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate degrees. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, "The New York Times", and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education.
Harvard's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May. Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time. In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work. Students graduating in the top 4–5% of the class are awarded degrees "summa cum laude", students in the next 15% of the class are awarded "magna cum laude", and the next 30% of the class are awarded "cum laude". Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually. Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation, although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased. Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% in 2004 to 60% in 2005. Moreover, the honors of "John Harvard Scholar" and "Harvard College Scholar" will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class.
University policy is to expel students engaging in academic dishonesty to discourage a "culture of cheating." 
In 2012, dozens of students were expelled for cheating after an investigation of more than 120 students. In 2013, there was a report that as many as 42% of incoming freshmen had cheated on homework prior to entering the university, and these incidents have prompted the university to consider adopting an honor code.
For the 201213 school year annual tuition was $38,000, with a total cost of attendance of $57,000. Beginning 2007, families with incomes below $60,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, including room and board. Families with incomes between $60,000 to $80,000 pay only few thousand dollars a year, and families earning between $120,000 and $180,000 pay no more than 10% of their annual incomes. In 2009, Harvard offered grants totaling $414 million across all eleven divisions; $340 million came from institutional funds, $35 million from federal support, and $39 million from other outside support. Grants total 88% of Harvard's aid for undergraduate students, with aid also provided by loans (8%) and work-study (4%).
Academic organization.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There is also the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Harvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University. There are 16,000 staff and faculty.
Harvard's 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students. The school color is crimson, which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, "The Harvard Crimson". The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869–1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.
Joint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.
Research.
Harvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and remains a research university with "very high" research activity and a "comprehensive" doctoral program across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine. Research and development expenditures in 2011 totaled $649.7 million, 27th among American universities.
Libraries and museums.
The Harvard University Library System is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises over 80 individual libraries holding some 15 million volumes. According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the United States, and one of the largest in the world.
Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use, with easy access and central locations. There are rare books, manuscripts and other special collections throughout Harvard's libraries; Houghton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library.
Harvard operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums. The Harvard Art Museums comprises three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum includes collections of ancient, Asian, Islamic and later Indian art, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, formerly the Germanic Museum, covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum of Art, covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art. The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum, Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Other museums include the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, designed by Le Corbusier, housing the film archive, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, specializing in the cultural history and civilizations of the Western Hemisphere, and the Semitic Museum featuring artifacts from excavations in the Middle East.
University rankings.
Harvard has been highly ranked by many international and domestic university rankings. In particular, it has consistently topped the "Academic Ranking of World Universities" ("ARWU") since 2003, and the "Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings", which is based on a survey of academics around the world and is a spin-off of the main world rankings, since 2011, when the first time such league tables were published. When the QS and Times were published in partnership as the "THE-QS World University Rankings" during 2004-2009, Harvard had been also regarded the first in every year. The University's undergraduate program has been continuously among the top two in the "U.S. News & World Report", in every case tied with or behind Princeton. In 2012, Harvard topped the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), and was ranked 8th on the 2013-2014 PayScale College Salary Report and 14th on the 2013 PayScale College Education Value Rankings.
From a poll done by "The Princeton Review", Harvard is the second most commonly named "dream college", both for students and parents in 2013, and was the first nominated by parents in 2009.
Tradition and culture.
Athletics.
The Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in "The Game", although the Harvard–Yale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.
Harvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply "The Game". While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the Father of Football, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.
Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the "MAC", serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes. It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling. The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are also in the MAC.
Weld Boathouse and Newell Boathouse house the women's and men's rowing teams, respectively. The men's crew also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, as their training camp for the annual Harvard-Yale Regatta. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the Harvard hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for Harvard's squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports.
As of 2013, there were 42 Division I intercollegiate varsity sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other NCAA Division I college in the country. As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.
Older than "The Game" by 23 years, the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing. Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team (with a strong rivalry against Cornell), squash, and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's Fencing. Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003.
Harvard's men's ice hockey team won the school's first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989. Harvard was also the first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women's sport when its women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Championship in 1990.
"Harvard Undergraduate Television" has footage from historical games and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale Game.
Song.
Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are "Ten Thousand Men of Harvard" and "Harvardiana." While "Fair Harvard" is actually the alma mater, "Ten Thousand Men" is better known outside the university. The Harvard University Band performs these fight songs, and other cheers, at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus Tom Lehrer in his song "Fight Fiercely, Harvard," which he composed while an undergraduate.
People.
Students.
In the last six years, Harvard's student population ranged between 19,000 and 21,000, across all programs. Harvard enrolled 6,655 students in undergraduate programs, 3,738 students in graduate programs, and 10,722 students in professional programs. The undergraduate population is 51% female, the graduate population is 48% female, and the professional population is 49% female.
Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as "more selective, lower transfer-in". Harvard College received 27,500 applications for admission to the Class of 2013, 2,175 were admitted (8%), and 1,658 enrolled (76%). 95% of first-year students graduated in the top tenth of their high school class. Harvard also enrolled 266 National Merit Scholars, the most in the nation. 88% of students graduate within 4 years and 98% graduate within 6 years.
Harvard College accepted 5.8% of applicants for the class of 2017, a record low. The number of acceptances has gone down since the university announced a large increase in financial aid in 2008. Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities. For the Class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced. The undergraduate admissions office's preference for children of alumni policies have been the subject of scrutiny and debate as it primarily aids whites and the wealthy and seems to conflict with the concept of meritocratic admissions.
Faculty and staff.
Harvard's faculty includes scholars such as biologist E. O. Wilson, cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, physicists Lisa Randall and Roy Glauber, chemists Elias Corey, Dudley R. Herschbach and George M. Whitesides, computer scientists Michael O. Rabin and Leslie Valiant, Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt, writer Louis Menand, critic Helen Vendler, historians Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Niall Ferguson, economists Amartya Sen, N. Gregory Mankiw, Robert Barro, Stephen A. Marglin, Don M. Wilson III and Martin Feldstein, political philosophers Harvey Mansfield, Baroness Shirley Williams and Michael Sandel, political scientists Robert Putnam, Joseph Nye, and Stanley Hoffmann, scholar/composers Robert Levin and Bernard Rands, astrophysicist Alyssa A. Goodman, and legal scholar Alan Dershowitz.
Past faculty members include Michael Walzer, Stephan Thernstrom and Robert Nozick.

Literature and popular culture.
The perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege, has made it a frequent literary backdrop.
Onscreen.
Because Harvard generally forbids filming on its property, most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.

Fort Egbert was established in 1899, during the Klondike Gold Rush, as U.S. Army headquarters in the District of Alaska. It was named by U.S. President William McKinley in honor of Colonel Harry C. Egbert, who died in battle on March 26, 1899 in Manila.
The base was constructed next to Eagle Bluff, a rocky outcropping overlooking Eagle, a Yukon River mining community near the Canadian border. Eagle, which was established on a military reservation, was placed under the jurisdiction of the new base “until such time as some form of civil government may be established.” Eagle was released from martial law on July 23, 1900.
Fort Egbert was designated as the first station in the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS), a network of telegraph lines connecting Alaska with the contiguous United States. The first link in the system was completed in October 1900, running from Dawson City in the Canadian Yukon Territory to Fort Egbert. Another link, completed August 24, 1902, connected Fort Egbert with Fort Liscum in Valdez. In 1905, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen used Fort Egbert's telegraph station to announce his successful crossing of the Northwest Passage.
Fort Egbert was abandoned in 1911 except for an Army Signal Corps contingent, which continued to operate a station until 1925, when the wireless station (which had replaced the land lines) burned to the ground.
Five buildings of the original Fort Egbert have been preserved under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management.

NASA

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the agency of the United States government that is responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.
Since that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.
NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic missions such as "New Horizons", and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs. NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.
Creation.
From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1. In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite ("Sputnik 1") on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The U.S. Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. This led to an agreement that a new federal agency mainly based on NACA was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in February 1958 to develop space technology for military application.
On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 46-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 million, three major research laboratories (Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory) and two small test facilities. A was approved by President Eisenhower in 1959. Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the Space Race with the Soviet Union was the technology from the German rocket program led by Wernher von Braun, who was now working for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), which in turn incorporated the technology of American scientist Robert Goddard's earlier works. Earlier research efforts within the U.S. Air Force and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA. In December 1958, NASA gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology.
Space flight programs.
NASA has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history. Unmanned programs launched the first American artificial satellites into Earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with Venus and Mars, and including "grand tours" of the outer planets. Manned programs sent the first Americans into low Earth orbit (LEO), won the Space Race with the Soviet Union by landing twelve men on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 in the Apollo program, developed a semi-reusable LEO Space Shuttle, and developed LEO space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet Russia.
Manned programs.
The experimental rocket-powered aircraft programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal "of landing a man on the Moon by the end of 60s, and returning him safely to the Earth." This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, .
X-15 rocket plane (1959–68).
The X-15 was an NACA experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force and Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems. Requests for proposal were issued on December 30, 1954 for the airframe, and February 4, 1955 for the rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to North American Aviation in November 1955, and the XLR30 engine contract was awared to Reaction Motors in 1956, and three planes were built. The X-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two NASA Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, NB52A tail number 52-003, and NB52B, tail number 52-008 (known as the "Balls 8"). Release took place at an altitude of about and a speed of about .
Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA (later NASA). One hundred ninety-nine flights were made between 1959 and 1968, resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft (current ), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, . The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km). Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force astronaut wings for flying above , and two flights by Joseph A. Walker exceeded , qualifying as spaceflight according to the International Aeronautical Federation. The X-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs, including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, pressurized space suits, and horizon definition for navigation. The reentry and landing data collected were valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle. 
Project Mercury (1959–63).
Shortly after the Space Race began, an early objective was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. U.S. Air Force's Man In Space Soonest program looked at many manned spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules. By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule. 
When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred to it and renamed "Project Mercury". The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard "Freedom 7", launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight. John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962 aboard "Friendship 7". Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight "Faith 7", May 15–16, 1963.
The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok. They beat the U.S. for the first man in space, by launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight. In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent Vostok 4 mission carrying Pavel Popovich.
Project Gemini (1961–66).
Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.
Under the direction of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man Voskhod. They succeeded in launching two manned flights before Gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first EVA in 1964. After this, the program was then canceled, and Gemini caught up while spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev developed the Soyuz spacecraft, their answer to Apollo.
Project Apollo (1961–72).
The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in putting the first man in space, motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.
Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It is estimated to have cost $ in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.)
It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.
The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968. Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon. On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.
The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind. The Moon landing marked the end of the space race and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.
Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.
Skylab (1965–79).
Skylab was the United States' first and only independently built space station. Conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent Saturn IB upper stage, the station was constructed on Earth and launched on May 14, 1973 atop the first two stages of a Saturn V, into a orbit inclined at 50° to the equator. Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974. It included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity, and a solar observatory. NASA planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.
To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the Skylab. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. Skylab's habitable volume was , which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the Apollo Command Module.
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1972–75).
On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other. This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.
The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments, and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US–Russian space flights, such as the Shuttle–Mir Program and the International Space Station.
Space Shuttle program (1972–2011).
The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, "Columbia", did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin.
Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.
On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the ESA. Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.
In 1995 Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle-Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as the two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle "Columbia" disaster.
The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: "Challenger" in 1986, and "Columbia" in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle "Endeavour" from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle "Atlantis" at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.
International Space Station (1993–present).
The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's "Space Station Freedom" project with the Soviet/Russian "Mir-2" station, the European "Columbus" station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop "Freedom" alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.
Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS. The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members. Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past , having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations. 
The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, , is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012 and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.
The ISS program is expected to continue until at least 2020 but may be extended until 2028 or possibly beyond that.
Commercial Resupply Services (2006-present).
The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS. The development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program, meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful completed the milestone. Private companies were also required to have some "skin in the game" which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal.
On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation. SpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. Orbital Sciences uses its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. The first Dragon resupply mission occurred in May 2012. The first Cygnus resupply mission occurred in September 2013. The CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs; with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the European ATV and the Japanese HTV.
Commercial Crew Program (2010–present).
The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth. It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.
In 2010, NASA announced the winners of the first phase of the program, a total of $50 million was divided among five American companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector. In 2011, the winners of the second phase of the program were announced, $270 million was divided among four companies. In 2012, the winners of the third phase of the program were announced, NASA provided $1.1 billion divided among three companies to further develop their crew transportation systems. This phase of the CCDev program is expected to last from June 3, 2012 to May 31, 2014. The winners of this latest round were SpaceX's Dragon planned to be launched on a Falcon 9, Boeing's CST-100 planned to be launched on an Atlas V and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser, which is also planned to be launched on an Atlas V. NASA will most likely only choose one provider for the Commercial Crew program, this vehicle is expected by NASA to become operational around 2017.
Beyond Low Earth Orbit program (2010–present).
For missions beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA has been directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed the design selection of the new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) that would replace the formerly planned Ares V should be delayed until 2015. He also proposed that the United States should send a crew to an asteroid in the 2020s and send a crew to Mars orbit in the mid-2030s. The U.S. Congress drafted the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 and President Obama signed it into law on October 11 of that year. The authorization act officially canceled the Constellation program.
The Authorization Act required a new HLV design to be chosen within 90 days of its passing and for the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft. The authorization act called this new HLV the Space Launch System. The authorization act also required a beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft to be developed, the Orion spacecraft, which was being developed as part of the Constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role. The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit. The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift 70 mt into LEO, it is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt.
Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of Orion's crew module, is planned to be launched in 2014 on a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS that would also send Orion on a circumlunar trajectory, which is planned for 2017. The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) is to launch between 2019 and 2021; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit. As of March 2012, the destination for EM-3 and the intermediate focus for this new program is still in-flux.
Unmanned programs.
More than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the solar system. Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA. The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.
The first US unmanned satellite was Explorer 1, which started as an ABMA/JPL project during the early space race. It was launched in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA the Explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind, among other aspects. A more recent Earth mission, not related to the Explorer program, was the Hubble Space Telescope, which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.
The inner Solar System has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and 70s, which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), to take the first pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.
The first successful landing on Mars was made by Viking 1 in 1976. Twenty years later a rover was landed on Mars by Mars Pathfinder.
Outside Mars, Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later "Galileo" sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet. Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.
Pioneers 10 and 11 and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. A problem with deep space travel is communication. For instance, it takes about 3 hours at present for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft at a point more than halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.
On November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission was successfully launched for Mars. "Curiosity" successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.
Recent and planned activities.
NASA's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars and Saturn and studies of the Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are MESSENGER for Mercury, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support "in situ" exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini (1997–), and Juno (2011–).
The New Horizons mission to Pluto was launched in 2006 and is currently en route for a Pluto flyby in 2015. The probe received a gravity assist from Jupiter in February 2007, examining some of Jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. On the horizon of NASA's plans is the MAVEN spacecraft as part of the Mars Scout Program to study the atmosphere of Mars.
On December 4, 2006, NASA announced it was planning a permanent moon base. The goal was to start building the moon base by 2020, and by 2024, have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in-situ resource utilization. However in 2009, the Augustine Committee found the program to be on a "unsustainable trajectory." In 2010, President Barack Obama halted existing plans, including the Moon base, and directed a generic focus on manned missions to asteroids and Mars, as well as extending support for the International Space Station.
Since 2011, NASA's strategic goals have been
In August 2011, NASA accepted the donation of two space telescopes from the National Reconnaissance Office. Despite being stored unused, the instruments are superior to the Hubble Space Telescope.
In September 2011, NASA announced the start of the Space Launch System program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle. The Space Launch System is intended to launch the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and other elements towards the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and one day Mars. The Orion MPCV is planned for an unmanned test launch on a Delta IV Heavy rocket around late 2013.
On August 6, 2012, NASA landed the rover "Curiosity" on Mars. On August 27, 2012, "Curiosity" transmitted the first pre-recorded message from the surface of Mars back to Earth, made by Administrator Charlie Bolden:
Hello. This is Charlie Bolden, NASA Administrator, speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the Curiosity Rover, which is now on the surface of Mars.
Since the beginning of time, humankind’s curiosity has led us to constantly seek new life…new possibilities just beyond the horizon. I want to congratulate the men and women of our NASA family as well as our commercial and government partners around the world, for taking us a step beyond to Mars.
This is an extraordinary achievement. Landing a rover on Mars is not easy – others have tried – only America has fully succeeded. The investment we are making…the knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of Gale Crater, will tell us much about the possibility of life on Mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet. Curiosity will bring benefits to Earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers, as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future.
Thank you.

Medicine in space.
A variety of large-scale medical studies are being conducted in space by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Study, in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders Leroy Chiao and Gennady Padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. Usually there is no physician on board the International Space Station, and diagnosis of medical conditions is challenging. Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness, barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, sleep disturbances, and radiation injury. Ultrasound offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.
Ozone depletion.
In 1975, NASA was directed by legislation to research and monitor the upper atmosphere. This led to Upper Atmosphere Research Program and later the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites in the 1990s to monitor ozone depletion. The first comprehensive worldwide measurements were obtained in 1978 with the Nimbus 7 satellite and NASA scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Salt evaporation and energy management.
In one of the nation's largest restoration projects, NASA technology helps state and federal government reclaim of salt evaporation ponds in South San Francisco Bay. Satellite sensors are used by scientists to study the effect of salt evaporation on local ecology.
NASA has started Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation Program as an agency-wide program directed to prevent pollution and reduce energy and water utilization. It helps to ensure that NASA meets its federal stewardship responsibilities for the environment.
Earth science.
Understanding of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment is the main objective of NASA's Earth science. NASA currently has more than a dozen Earth science spacecraft/instruments in orbit studying all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere), with several more planned for launch in the next few years.
NASA is working in cooperation with National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The goal is to produce worldwide solar resource maps with great local detail. NASA was also one of the main participants in the evaluation innovative technologies for the cleanup of the sources for dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). On April 6, 1999, the agency signed The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) along with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, DOE, and USAF authorizing all the above organizations to conduct necessary tests at the John F. Kennedy Space center. The main purpose was to evaluate two innovative in-situ remediation technologies, thermal removal and oxidation destruction of DNAPLs. National Space Agency made a partnership with Military Services and Defense Contract Management Agency named the “Joint Group on Pollution Prevention”. The group is working on reduction or elimination of hazardous materials or processes.
On May 8, 2003, Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities—the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.
Staff and leadership.
NASA's administrator is the agency's highest-ranking official and serves as the senior space science adviser to the President of the United States. The agency's administration is located at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC and provides overall guidance and direction. Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be citizens of the United States.
The first administrator was Dr. T. Keith Glennan, appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower; during his term he brought together the disparate projects in space development research in the US.
The third administrator was James E. Webb (served 1961–1968), appointed by President John F. Kennedy. In order to implement the Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon by 1970, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center.
In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Charles Bolden as NASA's twelfth administrator. Administrator Bolden is one of three NASA administrators that were astronauts along with Richard H. Truly (served 1989–1992) and Frederick D. Gregory (acting, 2005).
Facilities.
NASA's facilities are research, construction and communication centers to help its missions. Some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line railroad at the Kennedy Space Center and own special aircraft for instance two of the Space Shuttle orbiter.
John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is one of the best-known NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
Another major facility is Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama at which the Saturn 5 rocket and Skylab were developed. The JPL, mentioned above, was together with ABMA one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, the first American space mission.
Budget.
NASA's budget has generally been approximately 1% of the federal budget from the early 1970s on, but briefly peaked to approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the Apollo program. Recent public perception of the NASA budget has been shown to be significantly different from reality; a 1997 poll indicated that Americans responded on average that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.
The percentage of federal budget that NASA has been allocated has been steadily dropping since the Apollo program and as of 2012 the NASA budget is estimated to be 0.48% of the federal budget. In a March 2012 meeting of the United States Senate Science Committee, Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that "Right now, NASA’s annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow." Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, the Penny4NASA nonprofit was founded in 2012 to advocate the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget, or one "penny on the dollar."

Conover Beacon

The Conover Beacon is a lighthouse in Leonardo section of Middletown Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey that functioned as the front light of the now-discontinued Chapel Hill Range.
History.
The Chapel Hill Channel provides a north-south connection between the Ambrose Channel (the main channel into the Narrows) and Sandy Hook Channel, which continues west into Raritan Bay. This channel was marked, beginning in 1856, by range lights, named after the hill on which the original rear light stands. The original front beacon was a hexagonal wooden tower built at the edge of the beach in Leonardo, New Jersey. The land on which the light stood was purchased from Rulif Conover, who thus lent his name to the finished beacon.
The original tower stood until 1941, though the light was discontinued for several months in 1923, only to be restored after protests. In 1941 the front range tower from the Waackaack Range was moved to a spot adjacent to the old tower, and it served as the front light for the range until discontinuance in 1988. This skeletal tower with a central shaft remains in place, and is managed by Middletown Township, New Jersey. Both the old and the new towers used the same daymark: a red band on a white tower.

Harpers Ferry Historic District

The Harpers Ferry Historic District comprises about one hundred historic structures in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The historic district includes the portions of the central town not included in Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, including large numbers of early 19th-century houses built by the United States Government for the Harpers Ferry Armory. Significant buildings and sites include the site of the Armory, the U.S Armory Potomac Canal, the Harpers Ferry Train Station, and Shenandoah Street, Potomac Street, and High or Washington Street. The National Historic Park essentially comprises the lower, flood-prone areas of the town, while the Historic District comprises the upper town.
In the late 19th century a number of Victorian and Federalist-style houses were built on the high ground and received guests who included Mark Twain, Alexander Graham Bell and Woodrow Wilson. "Stonewall" Jackson also made the town his base of command during part of the Civil War and Thomas Jefferson said of the ferry area that: "The passage of the Patowmac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in Nature."
The historic district preserves what is essentially an intact 19th-century town that occupied a pivotal role in the American Civil War, and later as a transportation center. Thousands of tourists visit the town every year, however, parking in town is scarce. In order to better manage traffic in the small streets and enhance the feel of this historic town visitors are asked to park at the nearby Visitors Center and take the Park Service bus into the town itself. Taking the bus not only also gives visitors a view of the traditional infrastructure that made Harpers Ferry so important prior to the 20th century.
A commuter train line stops in town at a historic train station and conveniently stops at Brunswick, Point of Rocks, Dickerson, Barnesville, Boyds, Germantown, Metropolitan Grove, Gaithersburg, Washington Grove, Rockville, Garrett Park, Kensington, Silver Spring, and Union Station in D.C.
Due to repeated flooding in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town entered a decline that resulted in the inadvertent preservation of much of the original town fabric. Two National Register properties adjoin the Harpers Ferry Historic District—the B & O Railroad Potomac River Crossing and St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church.

Palpatine

Palpatine is a fictional character in the "Star Wars" space opera franchise created by George Lucas as the main antagonist of the "Original trilogy", "Prequel trilogy", and the Star Wars "Expanded Universe". He is portrayed in the live action films by Ian McDiarmid.
In the original trilogy, the character appears as the aged, pale-faced and nearly decrepit Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic Empire. In the prequel trilogy, his character is a rather elderly Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic who rises to power through deception and treachery. As the senator from Naboo and then the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, he outwardly behaves like a well-intentioned public servant and supporter of democracy. He is a double agent whose true identity is the "Dark Lord of the Sith" known as Darth Sidious. From behind the scenes, he murdered his former master Darth Plagueis, has Darth Maul reveal the Sith's existence for the first time in 1,000 years, has Darth Tyranus instigate the Clone Wars, corrupts Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force, used the Great Jedi Purge to commit xeno-genocide on a galaxy-wide scale, and transforms the Republic into a "Sith theocrat-stratocracy" authoritarian regime.
Since the initial theatrical run of "Star Wars", he has become a symbol of evil and sinister deception in popular culture.
Appearances.
Original trilogy.
In "", the Emperor is mentioned as the Galactic Empire's ruler by Grand Moff Tarkin during a meeting with the Death Star's council. There, Tarkin explains that the Emperor has dissolved the Galactic Senate due to increasing support for the Rebel Alliance and given direct control to the regional governors of the star systems controlled by the Empire.
In "", the Emperor appears for the first time as the Sith master of Darth Vader.
In "", Emperor Palpatine personally arrives to oversee the last stages of the second Death Star's construction and to set a trap for the Rebel Alliance. He assures Darth Vader that they will both turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tries to tempt the young Jedi to the dark side by appealing to his fear for his friends. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. When Luke refuses to turn to the dark side, the Emperor attacks him with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader redeems himself as Anakin Skywalker by throwing his former master into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing Palpatine.
Prequel trilogy.
In "", Senator Palpatine is the senior Galactic Senator from the planet Naboo. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious influences the corrupt Trade Federation to blockade and invade Naboo. Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo flees to the planet Coruscant to receive counsel from Palpatine. After a plea for help from the senate results in bureaucratic delays, he persuades the queen to make a motion to have Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum removed from office. Meanwhile, Sidious sends his Sith apprentice Darth Maul to Naboo to oversee the invasion and find the queen, but the invasion is thwarted by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. After the Trade Federation is defeated and Maul is presumed killed in a duel, Palpatine is elected the new Chancellor of the Republic and returns to Naboo, where he tells nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker that he "will watch [Anakin's] career with great interest".
In "" (set ten years later), Chancellor Palpatine continues to serve the Republic. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious continues to manipulate events behind the scenes by having his second Sith apprentice Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus) lead a movement of planets in seceding from the Republic to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Palpatine suggests Padawan Anakin Skywalker to bring Senator Padmé Amidala to Naboo for safety. Since the Separatists are secretly building a battle droid army, Palpatine uses the situation to have himself granted emergency powers. Palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising to return it to the Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow the usage of an army of cloned human warriors that were discovered by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi to counter the Separatist threat, resulting in a battle on Geonosis that serves as the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. After clone template Jango Fett is killed and the Separatist partners escape the battle, Tyranus meets with Sidious with plans for a Geonosian superweapon.
In "" (set three years later), Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is captured by Separatist leader General Grievous as part of Darth Sidious's plan. Palpatine is rescued by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, but not before the Jedi confront Count Dooku. A short duel ensues in which Anakin kills Dooku at Palpatine's insistence. Palpatine then escapes with his Jedi rescuers and returns to Coruscant. By this point, Palpatine has become a virtual dictator, able to take any action in the Senate. The Jedi Council is troubled by Palpatine's power and fears he will not relinquish it when the Clone Wars end. Their suspicions only grow when the Senate grants Palpatine a vote on the Jedi Council by appointing Anakin as his personal representative. The Council refuses to grant Anakin the rank of Jedi Master, and orders him to spy on Palpatine; Anakin instead reveals the Jedi's plan to him. Palpatine tells Anakin the story of a powerful Sith Lord who was able to manipulate life and death but was killed by his own apprentice. Eventually, Palpatine reveals his secret Sith identity to Anakin and tempts him with promises of the power to prevent death. Palpatine knows that Anakin has been having visions of his wife Padmé Amidala dying in childbirth, and offers to teach him the secrets to save her life.
After Anakin informs the Jedi of Palpatine's treachery, Jedi Master Mace Windu and three other Jedi Masters go to arrest Palpatine. However, Palpatine kills everyone but Windu, whom he engages in a duel. Windu deflects a burst of Force lightning back into Palpatine's face with his lightsaber, which severely disfigures him. After Anakin appears and intercedes on Palpatine's behalf by disarming Windu and, therefore, enabling Palpatine to kill the Jedi Master, Palpatine pledges Anakin to the dark side and is made into his third apprentice Darth Vader.
Palpatine commands the clone troopers to turn on their Jedi Generals while dispatching Vader to kill everyone inside the Jedi Temple and then to assassinate the Separatist leaders on the planet Mustafar. Palpatine then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire with himself as Emperor for life. Jedi Master Yoda confronts him in his Senate office and engages the Sith Lord in a duel that ends in a stalemate. Sensing that Vader is in danger, Palpatine travels to Mustafar and finds his apprentice near death following a duel with Obi-Wan. Palpatine returns to Coruscant and rebuilds his apprentice's immolated body with the black armored suit from the original trilogy. When Vader regains consciousness, Palpatine tells Vader that Padmé was killed in the heat of his anger. Palpatine is last seen watching the original Death Star's construction with Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin at his side.
Animated series.
Palpatine/Darth Sidious is a central character in Genndy Tartakovsky's "" micro-series, which is set between "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith". The character's likeness in the series is based on that in "The Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Clones".
In the first chapter, Palpatine is informed by Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Jedi have discovered that the InterGalactic Banking Clan has established battle droid factories on the planet Muunilinst. Palpatine agrees to send a strike force that includes Anakin Skywalker, and suggests that Anakin be given "special command" of Obi-Wan's fighters. Yoda and Obi-Wan initially speak against it, but reluctantly concede to the chancellor. In the seventh chapter, a holographic image of Sidious appears shortly after Dooku trains Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Sidious orders Ventress to track down and kill Anakin. He remarks to his second apprentice that her failure is certain, but the point of her mission is to test Anakin.
In the final chapters, a hologram of Sidious again appears and orders General Grievous to begin the special mission: an assault on the galactic capital. Later, the Separatist invasion of Coruscant begins and Palpatine watches from the window in his private residence. He is protected by Jedi Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb and Foul Moudama. Grievous breaks through the Chancellor's window and kidnaps him. After Grievous kills Roron and Foul then defeats Ti, Palpatine is taken to the "Invisible Hand" (Grievous's flagship), setting the stage for "Revenge of the Sith".
In the 2008 animated film "" (also set between "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith"), Darth Sidious engineers a Separatist plot where Count Dooku turns Jabba the Hutt against the Republic by kidnapping his son Rotta and framing the Jedi for it. Meanwhile, Palpatine suggests that the Republic ally itself with the Hutts. Although Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Ahsoka Tano foil the plot, the outcome suits Palpatine's ends: Jabba places Hutt hyperspace routes at the Republic's disposal.
In the , Palpatine continues to serve as Supreme Chancellor while Sidious remains behind the scenes via holograms. In the second season, Sidious hires bounty hunter Cad Bane to infiltrate the Jedi Temple and steal a holocron. He then takes a valuable Kyber memory crystal that contains the names of thousands of Force-sensitive younglings around the galaxy. The final stage of the plot: to bring four Force-sensitive children to Sidious's secret facility on Mustafar. Anakin and Ahsoka again foil the plot but Bane escapes and all evidence of Sidious's involvement is lost. In the fifth season, Sidious personally travels to the planet Mandalore to confront Darth Maul and Savage Opress (the new leaders of Death Watch). During a lightsaber duel, Sidious kills Savage with his two lightsabers and then tortures Maul with Force lightning.
Literature.
"Star Wars" Expanded Universe literature elaborates on Palpatine's role in "Star Wars" fiction outside of the films. The first appearance of Palpatine in "Star Wars" literature was in Alan Dean Foster's (writing as George Lucas) novelization of the script of "A New Hope", published as "" (1976). Foster characterizes Palpatine as a cunning senator who "caused himself" to be elected president of the Republic, and then declared himself Emperor and isolated himself from his subjects, eventually becoming a pawn of his advisers.
Palpatine made his first major appearance in the Expanded Universe in 1991 and 1992 with the "Dark Empire" series of comic books written by Tom Veitch and illustrated by Cam Kennedy. In the series (set six years after "Return of the Jedi"), Palpatine is resurrected as the Emperor Reborn or Palpatine the Undying. His spirit returns from the underworld of the Force with the aid of Sith ghosts on Korriban and possesses the body of Jeng Droga, one of Palpatine's elite spies and assassins known as the Emperor's Hands. Droga flees to a secret Imperial base on the planet Byss, where the Emperor's advisor Sate Pestage exorcises Palpatine's spirit and channels it into one of many clones created by Palpatine before his death. Palpatine attempts to resume control of the galaxy, but Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Master, sabotages his plans. Luke destroys most of Palpatine's cloning tanks, but is only able to defeat the Emperor with help from Leia Organa, now a Jedi herself. The two repel a Force storm Palpatine had created and turn it back onto him, once again destroying his physical form.
Palpatine's ultimate fate is further chronicled in the "Dark Empire II" and "Empire's End" series of comics. The "Dark Empire II" series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor is once again reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In "Empire's End" (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. Palpatine attempts to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a blaster shot fired by Han, and his spirit is captured by wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand using his remaining strength to dissipate Palpatine's spirit, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.
Novels and comics published before 1999 focus on Palpatine's role as Galactic Emperor. "" (1996) by Steve Perry and "The Mandalorian Armor" (1998) by K. W. Jeter—all set between "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi"—show how Palpatine uses crime lords such as Prince Xizor and bounty hunters like Boba Fett to fight his enemies. Barbara Hambly's novel "Children of the Jedi" (1995), set eight years after "Return of the Jedi", features a woman named Roganda Ismaren who claims that Palpatine fathered her son Irek. The "Jedi Prince" series of novels introduces an insane, three-eyed mutant named Triclops who is revealed to be Palpatine's illegitimate son. Created from DNA extracted from Palpatine and placed into a woman, he was born mutated, cast away and forgotten. Triclops had a son named Ken who became known as the "Jedi Prince".
Beginning in 1999 with Terry Brooks' , "Star Wars" writers chronicled the role of Palpatine prior to "A New Hope" as a politician and Sith Lord. The comic "Marked" by Rob Williams, printed in "Star Wars Tales 24" (2005), and Michael Reaves's novel ' (2001) explain Darth Sidious' relationship with his apprentice Darth Maul. "Cloak of Deception" (2001) by James Luceno follows Reaves's novel and details how Darth Sidious encourages the Trade Federation to build an army of battle droids in preparation for the invasion of Naboo. "Cloak of Deception" also focuses on Palpatine's early political career, revealing how he becomes a confidante of Chancellor Finis Valorum and acquainted with Padmé Amidala, newly elected queen of Naboo. Palpatine's role during the Clone Wars as Chancellor of the Republic and Darth Sidious is portrayed in novels such as Matthew Stover's "Shatterpoint" (2003), Steven Barnes' "The Cestus Deception" (2004), Sean Stewart's ' (2004), and Luceno's "Labyrinth of Evil" (2005) and "Darth Plagueis" (2012).
Following the theatrical release of "Revenge of the Sith", "Star Wars" literature focused on Palpatine's role after the creation of the Empire. John Ostrander's comic "Star Wars Republic 78: Loyalties" (2005) chronicles how, shortly after seizing power, Emperor Palpatine sends Darth Vader to assassinate Sagoro Autem, an Imperial captain who plans to defect from the Empire. In Luceno's novel "" (2005) (set shortly after "Revenge of the Sith"), the Emperor sends Darth Vader to the planet Murkhana to discover why clone troopers there refused to carry out Order 66 against their Jedi generals. Palpatine hopes these early missions will teach Vader what it means to be a Sith and crush any remnants of Anakin Skywalker.
Characteristics.
In "Star Wars" fiction, Palpatine is a cunning politician, a ruthless emperor, and an evil Sith Lord. The Star Wars Databank describes him as "the supreme ruler of the most powerful tyrannical regime the galaxy had ever witnessed" and Stephen J. Sansweet's "Star Wars Encyclopedia" calls him "evil incarnate."
As a senator, Palpatine is "unassuming yet ambitious". In "Cloak of Deception", James Luceno writes that Palpatine carefully guards his privacy and "others found his reclusiveness intriguing, as if he led a secret life". Despite this, he has many allies in the government. Luceno writes, "What Palpatine lacked in charisma, he made up for in candor, and it was that directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate. ... For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms, with a clear sense of right and wrong." In Terry Brooks' , Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles. He tells Queen Amidala, "I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected of the Republic, I will restore democracy to the Republic. I will put an end to the corruption that has plagued the Senate." A "Visual Dictionary" states that he is a self-proclaimed savior.
As Emperor, however, Palpatine abandons any semblance of democracy, as noted in "A New Hope", when he abolishes the Imperial Senate. Sansweet states, "His Empire ... is based on tyranny, hatred of nonhumans, brutal and lethal force, and, above all else, constant fear." In Matthew Stover's , Count Dooku anticipates the coming of the new government: "A government clean, pure, direct: none of the messy scramble for the favor of ignorant rabble and subhuman creatures that made up the Republic he so despised. The government he would serve would be Authority personified. "Human" authority."
"Revenge of the Sith" suggests that Palpatine was the apprentice of Darth Plagueis, while later Expanded Universe materials say explicitly that he was. Palpatine is characterized as "the most powerful practitioner of the Sith ways in modern times." Palpatine is so powerful that he is able to mask his true identity from the Jedi for decades. In the novel "Shatterpoint", Mace Windu remarks to Yoda, "A shame can't touch the Force. He might have been a fine Jedi."
The Star Wars Databank explains that the Force "granted him inhuman dexterity and speed, agility enough to quickly kill three Jedi Masters" (as depicted in "Revenge of the Sith"). Stover describes the duel between Yoda and Palpatine in his novelization of "Revenge of the Sith" thus: "From the shadow of a black wing, a small weapon ... slid into a withered hand and spat a flame-colored blade[.] When the blades met it was more than Yoda against Palpatine, more the millennia of Sith against the legions of Jedi; this was the expression of the fundamental conflict of the universe itself. Light against dark. Winner take all." During the duel, Yoda realizes that Sidious represents a small but powerful Sith Order that had changed and evolved over the years, while the Jedi had not: "He had lost before he started." George Lucas has stated that Palpatine considers himself the savior of the galaxy.
According to the Databank and "New Essential Guide to Characters", Palpatine possesses great patience and his maneuverings are as a dejarik grandmaster moves pieces on a board. He is depicted as a diabolical genius.
Character creation.
Lucas' conceptualization of Palpatine and the role the character plays in "Star Wars" changed over time. From "Return of the Jedi" onwards, Palpatine became the ultimate personification of evil in "Star Wars", replacing Darth Vader as the central villain.
When the original "Star Wars" trilogy was filmed, the Emperor was unnamed and his throne-world unidentified. Though it would not be used in film until the prequel trilogy, the first mention of the name Palpatine came from the prologue of Alan Dean Foster's 1976 novelization of "A New Hope", which detailed the Emperor's rise to power. Foster writes,
However, it is unclear whether Lucas intended Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of "The Secret History of Star Wars", claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.
During story conferences for "The Empire Strikes Back", Lucas and Leigh Brackett decided that "the Emperor and the Force had to be the two main concerns in the ["Empire Strikes Back"]; the Emperor had barely been dealt with in the first movie, and the intention in the sequel was to deal with him on a more concrete level." Lucas ultimately decided instead to feature the Emperor in "Return of the Jedi".
In that film, the initial conception of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept in the dark side of the Force. The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the "Flash Gordon" comic books. The rise of Palpatine involving an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is related to the real-world examples of Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler. Lucas said, "The whole point of the movies, the underlying element that makes the movies work, is that you, whether you go backwards or forwards, you start out in a democracy, and democracy turns into a dictatorship, and then the rebels make it back into a democracy."
Lucas wanted to establish the Emperor as the true source of evil in "Star Wars". Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted, "My sense of the relationship Darth Vader and the Emperor is that the Emperor is much more powerful ... and that Vader is very much intimidated by him. Vader has dignity, but the Emperor in "Jedi" really has all the power." He explained that the climax of the film is a confrontation between Darth Vader and his master. In the first scene that shows the Emperor, he arrives at the Death Star and is greeted by a host of stormtroopers, technicians, and other personnel. Lucas states he wanted it to look like the military parades on "May Day in Russia."
Lucas fleshed out the Emperor in the prequel films. According to Lucas, Palpatine's role in "The Phantom Menace" is to explain "how Anakin Skywalker came to be [Palpatine's] apprentice" and the events that lead to his rise to power. The true identity of Darth Sidious — the phantom menace — is left a mystery, and his relationship to Palpatine is not clear, though popular consensus agreed that Darth Sidious and Palpatine were one and the same. Film critic Jonathan L. Bowen remarks, "Debates raged on the Internet concerning the relationship between Darth Sidious and Senator Palpatine. Most fans believed the two characters are actually the same person with logic seeming to support their conclusion." Bowen notes that the debate was fueled by the fact that "suspiciously Darth Sidious does not appear in the credits."
In "Star Wars and History" published by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being alike to the Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself. Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering the powers of the head of state; both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.
Portrayal.
When the Emperor first appeared in "The Empire Strikes Back", he was portrayed by Elaine Baker, the wife of make-up designer Rick Baker. Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed into darkened eye sockets during post-production "in order to create a truly unsettling image". The character was voiced by Clive Revill.
"With Kershner," Revill said, "you had to keep the reins tight — you couldn't go overboard. It was the perfect example of the old adage 'less is more' — the Emperor doesn't say very much. But when he finally appears, it's at a point in the saga when everyone's waiting to see him. It's the Emperor, the arch villain of all time, and when he says there's a great disturbance in the Force, I mean, that's enough "oomph"!" Years later, during production of "Revenge of the Sith", Lucas decided to shoot new footage for "Empire Strikes Back" to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy. Thus, in the 2004 DVD release of "The Empire Strikes Back" Special Edition, the original version of the Emperor was replaced by McDiarmid, and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised.
Lucas and director Richard Marquand cast Scottish Shakespearean actor Ian McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine. He was in his late-30s and had never played a leading role in a feature film, though he had made minor appearances in films like "Dragonslayer" (1981). After "Return of the Jedi", he resumed stage acting in London. In an interview with "BackStage", McDiarmid revealed that he "never had his sights set on a film career and never even auditioned for the role of Palpatine." He elaborated, "I got called in for the interview after a "Return of the Jedi" casting director saw me perform in the Sam Shepard play "Seduced" at a studio theatre at the Royal Court. I was playing a dying Howard Hughes."
McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him 16 years after "Return of the Jedi" to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, "When we were doing "Return of the Jedi" there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." McDiarmid added, "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It never occurred to me in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor play Palpatine.' That would be obvious." However, "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what."
Palpatine's role in the prequel films required McDiarmid to play two dimensions of the same character. Recalling the initial days of shooting "The Phantom Menace", McDiarmid stated, "Stepping onto the set of "Episode I" for the first time was like going back in time, due to my experience in "Jedi". Palpatine's an interesting character; he's conventional on the outside, but demonic on the inside — he's on the edge, trying to go beyond what's possible." McDiarmid added another layer to the character in "Attack of the Clones". He noted, " is a supreme actor. He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a schizophrenic fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional — and for those who are looking for clues, that's almost where you can see them." McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padmé Amidala is almost assassinated:
In "Revenge of the Sith", McDiarmid played a darker interpretation of the character. He explained that "[...]when you're playing a character of solid blackness, that in itself is very interesting, in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." He admitted, "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's "Othello":
McDiarmid noticed that the script for "Revenge of the Sith" demanded more action from his character than in previous films. Lightsaber combat was a challenge to the 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.
McDiarmid's performance as Palpatine was generally well received by critics. Todd McCarthy of "Variety" commented, "Entertaining from start to finish and even enthralling at times, 'Sith' has some acting worth writing home about, specifically McDiarmid's dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire." A reviewer for "The Village Voice" wrote that "Ian McDiarmid's unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life." Still, his performance was not without detractors; David Edelstein of "Slate" critiqued, "McDiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic tempters. With his lisp and his clammy little leer, he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt-boy (Count Dooku) for fresh meat — which leaves Anakin looking more and more like a 15-watt bulb."
Make-up and costumes.
Ian McDiarmid required little make-up in "The Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Clones". He recalled, "I'm ... slightly aged "Attack of the Clones". In the last film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face." Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in "Return of the Jedi" and "Revenge of the Sith", however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked in an interview with "Star Wars Insider" magazine, "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But this was just a little bit of latex here and there, a little bit of skin-scrunching." He told the "Homing Beacon" newsletter, "When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of "The Phantom of the Opera" with Lon Chaney." Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he "looks uncannily like Death in "The Seventh Seal"" (1957) and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the witch from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Palpatine's wardrobe, tailored by costume designer Trisha Biggar, played an important part in the development of the character throughout the films. In "Attack of the Clones", explained McDiarmid, "The costumes ... have got much more edge to them, I think, than the mere senator had "The Phantom Menace". So we see the trappings of power." In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering." McDiarmid's favorite costume in "Revenge of the Sith" was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that "it just feels reptilian, which is exactly right for ." According to Trisha Biggar, Palpatine's costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, "His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking him toward the dark side."
Popular culture.
With the premiere of "Return of the Jedi" and the prequel films and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Palpatine became an icon in American popular culture. Kenner/Hasbro produced and marketed a series of action figures of the character from 1983 to 2005. According to John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett, "These action figures allow children ('4 & up') to handle the symbols of the Force."
Academics have debated the relationship of Palpatine to modern culture. Religion scholars Ross Shepard Kraemer, William Cassidy, and Susan Schwartz compare Palpatine and "Star Wars" heroes to the theological concept of dualism. They insist, "One can certainly picture the evil emperor in "Star Wars" as Satan, complete with his infernal powers, leading his faceless minions such as his red-robed Imperial Guards." Lawrence and Jewett argue that the killing of Palpatine in "Return of the Jedi" represented "the permanent subduing of evil".
Palpatine's role in popular culture extends beyond the "Star Wars" universe. Since the release of "Return of the Jedi", Palpatine has become synonymous in American mass media with evil, deception, manipulation, and power. The character is used as a literary device — either as a simile or metaphor — to emphasize these traits. In film and television, Palpatine's likeness is similarly used as a parody. Several animated television series such as "The Simpsons", "Family Guy", "South Park", "Robot Chicken", and "American Dad!", have employed Palpatine's image to satirize characters and public figures.
Since "Return of the Jedi" and the prequel films, Palpatine's name has been invoked as a caricature in politics. The liberal website BuzzFlash remarked in 2004, "When we saw ... Zell Miller [of Georgia giving his invective at the RNC, we knew it reminded us of someone. We just couldn't place it until we realized it was the hate in Zell's eyes, his skin and the way it looks like that hate is eating his soul. Then we remembered: he reminded us of the evil Emperor Palpatine from "Star Wars". ("We didn't know the Emperor had a name until this morning.")" A "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" editorial noted that anti-pork bloggers were caricaturing West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd as "the Emperor Palpatine of pork" with Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska having "clear aspirations to be his Darth Vader." The charge followed a report that linked a secret hold on the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to the two senators. Politicians have made comparisons as well. In 2005, Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey compared Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee to Palpatine in a speech on the Senate floor, complete with a visual aid.
A Fox News editorial stated "no cultural icon can exist without someone trying to stuff it into a political ideology. The "Star Wars" saga, the greatest pop culture icon of the last three decades, is no exception... Palpatine's dissolution of the Senate in favor of imperial rule has been compared to Julius Caesar's marginalization of the Roman Senate, Hitler's power-grab as chancellor, and FDR's court-packing scheme and creation of the imperial presidency."
A pig version of Palpatine appears as a playable character in "Angry Birds Star Wars II". Rovio Entertainment also created a "Join the Pork Side" promo video starring the Emperor, and features Ian McDiarmid reprising his role from the film series.

MAKNA

MAKNA (Majlis Kanser Nasional) or National Cancer Council Malaysia is a not-for-profit social enterprise mainly tasked to pool and utilise every effort, expertise and welfare from every faction of society to fight cancer and to reduce the pain, suffering and morbidity that the cancer patients often experience. It aims to provide curative care, preventive care, cancer research and support services to cancer patients and their families, high-risk groups and the general public in Malaysia and throughout the world. Together with ordinary Malaysians from all walks of life, MAKNA hope to inspire extraordinary change and give people affected by cancer renewed hope in life. 
MAKNA registered under the Register of Societies Malaysia on 10 November 1994 and officially launched on 30 March 1995. It was founded by Dato’ Mohd Farid Ariffin in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The organization is named after the Malay language word for 'meaning' ("makna") and its slogan is "A Meaning to Life".
Periwinkle Symbol.
The notable logo of MAKNA is inspired by the periwinkle flower, scientifically named "Catharanthus roseus" (Madagascar Periwinkle), a species of the "Catharanthus" native and endemic to Madagascar. Locally known as "Kemunting Cina", periwinkle is a perennial plant commonly found in the gardens, by the roadside and even on the playgrounds in Malaysia. This lovely and delicate flower is in fact revolutionizing the treatment of cancer through a number of chemotherapy drugs. Chemicals in these plants have been found to contain the unique ability to keep certain kinds of cancerous cells from reproducing. For example, these chemicals have been known to have helped increase the survival rate of childhood leukaemia from a mere 10 per cent to 95 per cent!
The most important plant source ingredient in chemotherapy is alkaloids from the Madagascar Periwinkle. Two alkaloids named vinblastine and vincristine are today commonly used individually or combined with other forms of therapy for cancer treatment. With these meaningful contribution to the cancer society, MAKNA decided to embrace this flower as the organization's emblem in the battle against cancer.
Dato’ Mohd Farid Ariffin - The Founder.
Dato' Mohd Farid Arifin has vast management, organisational and entrepreneurship experience, having served as a teacher, lecturer and lawyer and later as Deputy Finance Minister (1987 – 1989) and Deputy Health Minister (1989 – 1995).
MAKNA was set up from his own family experience, and today it is a home-grown organisation fully focused on cancer.
His teenage son Farul Rafiq was 17 when diagnosed with leukemia (blood cancer) in 1992. Farul was flown to London, England (Hammersmith Hospital) for treatment. There, he underwent a regimented treatment which included an autologous bone marrow transplant, which was not yet available in Malaysia. A few years into battling the diseases, he was finally certified cancer-free.
While recuperating at the hospital in London, Dato’ Mohd Farid’s family made a promise that on their return to Malaysia, they would set up a cancer organisation aimed to help those from lower income groups gain access to cancer treatment. 
On 4 August 2011, MAKNA sadly lost Farul, he passed away owing to lung fibrosis (not to cancer).

Eduardo Xol

Eduardo Torres Xol (born February 19, 1966) is an American television personality, designer, entertainer, social activist and businessman. He is most known to U.S. television audiences for his work as a designer on "" which formerly aired on ABC.
Childhood and education.
Xol was born on February 19, 1966. He is the oldest son of Eduardo and Mirna Torres. He grew up in East Los Angeles, California. His younger siblings are Monica Cayon and Ernesto Torres.
Before joining the cast of designers on ABC’s "", Eduardo had experienced a wide variety of accomplishments on both a national and global level. At one time, he was one of the youngest musicians to be scouted and selected to perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of ten. By age 13, at the request of the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico, he also traveled on an exchange program to give a series of piano recitals.
During his teens, Eduardo joined the Braand Theatre Company to perform at The Palm Beach Club in Cannes, France. It was during this time that Eduardo also made his feature film debut in the groundbreaking “Zoot Suit” with Edward James Olmos while dancing with the Mexican Dance Theatre of Los Angeles. His continued creative passions led him to enroll in the University of California, Los Angeles theatre program. While immersed in his studies, Eduardo began directing and producing several musical theatre comedy revues, which toured throughout the United States.
Early career.
Xol headed south to Latin America, where he fulfilled his desire of working in music and television in the Spanish-speaking market under the stage name of “Edi Xol”. He starred in several worldwide-syndicated telenovelas including “Acapulco Cuerpo y Alma”, “Sentimientos Ajenos" and "La Jaula de Oro" while producing music and videos.
His production company partnered with BMG U.S. Latin to produce his first solo album, “La Pasión”, for which he was nominated for a Premio Lo Nuestro's Artist of the Year, alongside Gloria Estefan and Ricky Martin. His representation of the United States at the International Music Festival at Viña Del Mar, Chile brought his appeal to a worldwide audience. Soon, Elle (magazine), Harper's Bazaar and Somos magazines featured the charming and down to earth Eduardo as one of Latin America's most eligible and gorgeous bachelors. 
In 1998, Xol decided to make the United States his home base once again as he transferred his experience in musical composition and entertainment production into the world of lifestyle and design. He began spending important time with his father as he learned the art of caring for bonsai trees. It was this return to plants that solidified his design aesthetic and life philosophy.
Television.
As one of the co-stars of ABC’s internationally syndicated TV show "", Eduardo’s compositions, especially in exterior design, have been on display for millions of people each week. He joined the cast in Season 2. He recently wrapped Season 8. Series reruns began airing on TV Land on Tuesday August 7, 2007. The show is also in syndication on CMT.
Partnerships.
Eduardo’s work extends into all forms of media. In addition to his monthly column that he authored in People en Español and AOL Latino, he has been featured and produced segments for Good Morning America, and was named among the “100 Most Influential Hispanics in America” by Hispanic Business Magazine. 
In 2010, Hayneedle announced the launch of the Hayneedle.com Backyard Summer, a multi-million dollar, integrated marketing campaign aimed at bringing variety to America’s homes with Eduardo as its celebrity designer offering his expertise and advice for outdoor design, outdoor living and landscaping. As part of the relationship, Eduardo executive produced and starred in a popular webisode series "Hayneedle Your Home" for the e-retailer. The relationship continued throughout the fall with a new campaign, "Countdown to Company", in which Eduardo gave decorating and entertaining tips to prepare for guests during the holidays. 
Xol has become a respected voice in both the Hispanic and English language markets, having partnered with companies such as the Ford Motor Company, Sears, Waterford Crystal, The Occasion Group/Taylor Corporation and DirecTV.
Books.
HarperCollins published Eduardo’s first book in the Spring of 2007 titled “Home Sense”, which was awarded the Best Self-Help Book at the 2008 International Latino Book Awards. His second book, “Extreme Entertaining Made Simple”, was published by the Penguin Group in the fall of 2008, and focused on entertaining for the senses and is one of the few lifestyle entertainment titles to include a CD of originally composed and licensed music.
Charity work.
Eduardo Xol brings his wealth of diverse artistic training and education to many charities, especially to his role as co-founder of the ALUMI Media Group, a non-profit organization that brings alternative learning through media arts to students in underserved communities in the Los Angeles area. 
His philanthropic work has also made an impact on a national level. Eduardo has worked with the Lupus Foundation of America to increase public awareness as part of the Band Together for Lupus Campaign. An avid supporter of the Lupus Foundation, Eduardo has been committed to this particular cause as his sister Monica has been living with lupus for the past ten years. He recently created a garden oasis for his sister as part of his web-series for Hayneedle. 
Eduardo has been an avid supporter of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) over the years and has shot public service announcements as a part of the “Be an Ally & a Friend” public education campaign in both English and Spanish (with actresses Sofía Vergara and Zoe Zaldana). Eduardo has also recorded a public service announcement for the Michigan Humane Society and has worked in conjunction with The Trevor Project, Starkey Hearing Foundation, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Carroll County Courthouse (Ohio)

The Carroll County Courthouse is located in Carrollton, Ohio, and is the second for the county. It was designed by architect Frank Weary in the Second Empire style. The courthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on 1974-10-22.
History.
Carroll County was established in 1833 and carved from Columbiana, Harrison, Jefferson, Stark and Tuscarawas counties. The first courthouse was built in Carrollton in 1834 and was a simple two-story brick building with a cupola topping off the structure. The first courthouse was designed by Peter Herold and James McMullin was contracted as the builder. When McMullin failed to meet expectations and the contract was awarded to John Lacey who also failed to honor his contract. The county wished to finish the construction and in desperation placed the contract with John Rankin. Unfortunately for the county, Rankin to failed to meet the obligations of the contract and George Hampson was selected instead. Hampson remained at this post and saw the courthouse into completion in 1837.
The courthouse was determined to be too small and a new courthouse was selected from the architect Frank Weary. The design submitted was in the Second Empire style popular for courthouses.
Exterior.
Constructed in 1884-1885, it consists of rough sandstone blocks. The main entrance is reached by stairs and a small portico, with Corinthian columns supporting the balcony above. The first and second floors once were large rectangular panel windows, but have shrunk to conserve power and energy. The third floor windows were once large arched windows but they too have been shrunk. 
A projecting cornice rises over the roof above the entrance with the name "Carroll" inscribed in white and the year "1885" above it. a large fanlight rests below the nameplate and allows more light to infiltrate the building. On the other sides a gable rises with bracing from projecting Tudor style chimneys. A mansard roof rises to a central tower supporting a dome and four cardinal point clock faces. A small spire rises from the top. A statue of Justice once adorned this point but was taken down during renovations.
Writing shortly after the courthouse was completed, Henry Howe noted : "...costing with jail in the rear about $150,000. It is built mainly from Navarre sandstone, with some from Berea. It is just to the left of the old courthouse shown in the old view. The old courthouse was sold on the 11th of June for $196 and the bell for $138."
A two-story rear wing was added in 1976 to provide more room for the county jail and an annex for the county officials.
Interior.
The interior hosts smooth mosaic tiled floors, recently lowered ceilings and ornate steel staircases. The interior hosts four levels, one of which is underground. A renovation updated many features in the courthouse, such as wiring, heating and cooling and several decorative pieces. 
The courthouse is connected to the county jail and court annex located in the back of the complex. The annex was built in 1976 and is a simple red brick structure with no adornment and large rectangular windows. A solid balustrade runs along the building and hides the flat roof.

Xiaobitan Station

The Taipei Metro Xiaobitan Station is a terminal station on the Xiaobitan Branch Line located in Xindian District, New Taipei, Taiwan.
Station overview.
This elevated station has a side platform and two exits. Its platform length allows for a three-car, high capacity train. The station location is right next to the Xindian Depot, above the maintenance workshop.
The entrance to the station and platform are situated on the fourth floor of the depot. The station covers an area of 3,000 square meters, while the platform is 70.5 meters long. Two escalators are located at the two entrances and are 14.45 meters high and 16.52 meters high; they are the second longest elevators in the system after those at Zhongxiao Fuxing.
Public Art.
Public art at the station is themed "The Way to the Very Joyance", where the station design includes many elements designed to embrace nature. Pieces include "Time Jelly", a bronze piece shaped like melting toffee over a station wall, and "The Dancing Cloud", a plastic and steel piece situated on top of platform columns. Additional pieces include those in adjacent public squares around the station.
History.
Construction began on April 2, 2001, and after four year of construction was completed on September 30, 2004. When the line first opened, some people complained about noise problems. Thus, sound-muffling walls were built along the tracks coming into the station.
Although the station platform only allows room for a three-car trainset, when the station was first opened a six-car trainset was used on the line. In this case, only the first three train cars' doors opened at this station (selective door operation). It was not until July 22, 2006 that a dedicated three-car trainset began service on the line.

<doc id="18426857" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18426857" title="Fei Long">
Fei Long

Often described as an homage to or clone of Bruce Lee, Fei Long has been well received. He has appeared in other "Street Fighter" media, including the animated films and series, comics as well as subsequent games such as "Street Fighter Alpha 3" and the home versions of "Street Fighter IV".
Character design.
Fei Long was designed as a pastiche of a real-life martial artist and movie star Bruce Lee. The English localization of the original arcade game pays tribute to Bruce Lee by having Fei Long state "there could never be another legend like the great one and his son", a reference to Bruce Lee and his son Brandon, who died shortly before the release of the game, although these references were removed in the revised localization of the Game Boy Advance version of the game. His alternate costume in "Street Fighter IV" resembles Bruce Lee's outfit in "Enter the Dragon". His ultra in "Street Fighter IV" is a series of flurry punches into an uppercut followed by a flying kick which resembles a signature technique of Bruce Lee. Fei Long has been given a new Ultra combo in "Super Street Fighter IV" which furthers the homage to Bruce Lee by performing a flurry of punches ending with the "one inch punch."
Appearances.
In video games.
In "Super Street Fighter II", Fei Long is depicted as an action film star from Hong Kong who enters the World Warrior tournament to test his skill as a martial artist. In his ending in the game, he gives up his film career and forms his own kung-fu style known as the . His stage was inspired by the Tiger Balm Garden (Hong Kong).
Fei Long reappears in the console versions of "Street Fighter Alpha 3", where his stage was inspired by Kowloon Park. The game takes place before Fei Long achieved fame as a movie star, as he makes his first hit movie in his ending in the game. He returns as a playable character in the console versions of "Street Fighter IV".
As a non-playable character, Fei Long appears as a spectator in Dan Hibiki's stage in "Street Fighter Alpha 2" and in Felicias ending in "Super Gem Fighter: Mini-Mix" (Ken hooks her up with Fei Long to jumpstart her movie career), in which he also has a cameo in one of the stages, in a ramen restaurant.
Other appearances.
In "", Fei Long appears as an opponent who challenges Ryu to a match while taking a break from filming his new movie. He loses the fight with a broken arm, but he and Ryu become friends after Fei Long realises that his opponent was the one who beat Sagat. In Japanese version he is voiced by real-life mixed martial artist Masakatsu Funaki.
In the anime series "Street Fighter II V", Fei Long is portrayed as martial artist and movie star who is a childhood acquaintance of Chun-Li, having been trained by her father, Inspector Dorai. He ends up fighting against Ken, who poses as a stunt actor during the filming of a new movie, and the two become friendly acquaintances along with Ryu. He later fights Cammy, who injured but failed to kill Dorai, in the hospital, where Cammy had been sent by Balrog to finish the job. After Cammy realises that she was fooled, she and Fei Long join forces to take Balrog down. In the series, Fei Long looks up to Dorai as a father figure, and tells Dorai's superior that Dorai meant more to him than his biological father.
In UDON's comic adaptation of the "Street Fighter" storyline, Fei Long is caught up in Shadaloo's affairs after turning down a criminal movie producer's offer. Eventually, he joins Chun-Li and Gen to bring down the heads of the Hong Kong Shadaloo operation, Xiayu and Yanyu (two of M. Bison's Doll agents). They engage the pair at their Triad compound and fight off a legion of thugs and criminals before they send the duo running.
Fei Long also appears briefly in the manga "Cammy" by Masahiko Nakahira. He challenges Cammy to a fight although he is ignored by her, and then is forced to return to a movie shooting. Nakahira depicted Fei Long wearing Bruce Lee's trademark yellow tracksuit with black sidestripes from the film "Game of Death".
The character Captain Sawada replaced Fei Long for the "Street Fighter" live-action film.
Reception.
"The Seattle Times" described Fei Long as "the deadliest" of the new characters introduced in "Super Street Fighter II". In the 2002 poll by Capcom in Japan, he was voted as 38th most popular "Street Fighter" character. UGO.com included him amongst the top 50 "Street Fighter" characters, calling him "super serious competitor is a mainstay in the series and a fan favorite." "The Guardian" ranked him as the 12th top "Street Fighter" character in 2010.
IGN ranked Fei Long at number 19 in their 2008 list of top "Street Fighter" characters, stating "If there's any martial arts star who deserves a videogame homage, though, Bruce Lee is probably the one. Fei Long helped begin a long string of characters inspired by the kung fu icon Bruce Lee". GamesRadar featured him their article "Kickass Bruce Lee clones", noting that his gameplay performance "captured the essence of Lee’s iconic fighting style in his films."

The Conquistadors were born into the world of Fantasy Drum and Bugle Corps. Much like other fantasy sports, you create a team and try to win it all. Fantasy drum corps goes beyond merely a roster and numbers. Players take ownership over their groups and give them an identity, a name, a look. The Conquistadors as a fantasy group were based out of Roselle Park, New Jersey. They competed in Drum Corps Planet's fantasy drum corps circuit.
The real Conquistadors will be based out of the town of Vestal in Upstate New York and its surrounding areas. The name 'Roselle Park Conquistadors' will remain unchanged to both pay tribute to the fantasy world from which it came, and to ensure that for IRS and New York State corporation law purposes, there are no similarly named organizations. This also prevents the corps from being restricted to the town of Vestal alone without being able to branch out to other surrounding communities.

Designing Economic Mechanisms is a 2006 book by economists Leonid Hurwicz and Stanley Reiter. Hurwicz received the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson for their work on mechanism design. In this book, Hurwicz and Reiter presented systematic methods for designing decentralized economics mechanisms whose performance attains specified goals.
Summary.
Authors of this book, Leonid Hurwicz and Stanley Reiter, helped found the field of mechanism design. This book provides a guide for those who would design mechanisms. 
A decentralized mechanism is a mathematical structure that models institutions for guiding and coordinating economic activity. Such institutions are usually created by administrators, lawmakers, and officers of private companies to achieve their desired goals. Their purpose is to achieve their desired goal in such a way that economize on the resources needed to operate the institutions, and that provide incentives that induce the required behaviors. In this book, systematic procedures for designing mechanisms that achieve specified performance, and economize on the resources required to operate the mechanism, i.e., informationally efficient mechanisms, are presented. Most of the book deals with the systematic design procedures which are algorithms for designing informationally efficient mechanisms. In the book, informationally efficient dominant strategy implementation is also studied.

The Sydney Teachers College was established in 1906 with Alexander Mackie appointed Principal in November of the same year. Mackie firmly believed that the college could aspire to a partnership with the University of Sydney.
Prior to that there was a pupil-teacher system in New South Wales, followed by two training colleges, Hurlstone Residential College for women and Fort Street High School for men. Public dissatisfaction with the pupil-teacher system led to the establishment of a non-residential, co-educational training college in part of Blackfriars primary school on Parramatta Road (now Broadway). In 1905 men moved from Fort Street to Blackfriars, and in 1906 women moved from Hurlstone College to Blackfriars.
In the first year there were 189 students (of these, 178 were serving teachers). Mackie was appointed Lecturer in Education at the University (while continuing as Principal of the Teachers College) in 1909. In 1910 he also became Professor of Education and Principal of the Teachers College (positions held also by his successor, Christopher R. McRae). In the same year the University Senate approved a Diploma in Education, taught jointly by the University and the Teachers College.
An Act was passed in 1912 for construction of a new Teachers College in the grounds of the University of Sydney. However, the First World War delayed construction, and the foundation stone was not laid until 1917. The building was officially opened in 1925 (but students moved to the partially completed building in 1920).
By 1933 course offerings had become fixed: (a) 2 year ordinary course: to prepare teachers for primary and kindergarten work, science teaching in junior technical and domestic science schools, manual training, commercial work, agricultural and general instruction; (b) 4 year course and graduation from the University or a 3 year course (2 years at the University and 1 at College) for high school specialist teachers; (c) 5th year of study for some students (mostly honours students in science).
A short course was devised in 1938 to prepare tradesmen to teach trades within the Technical Education Branch of the Department of Public Instruction in this eventually expanded into a division within the College and later into an Institute of Sydney CAE.
The 1940s also saw an expansion of in-service training and post-college refresher courses for practising teachers; special courses offered for officers of the Child Welfare Department, the Health Department and the Housing Commission; courses developed in broadcasting, visual education, counselling, librarianship and religious education. This obviously led to a dramatic increase in the size of the college. A temporary Annex established in the Enmore Public School as the total number of students in 1951 was 2339. But in 1954 the Enmore Annex closed and its functions were transferred to North Newtown Intermediate High School in Carillon Avenue.
An additional campus was established for Technical Teacher Education in the GAZAL Building, Bulwarra Road, Ultimo and a further campus for Primary Teacher Education at Salisbury Road, Newtown.
The 1970s saw the college go through many changes. In September 1971 Sydney Teachers College became a College of Advanced Education within the Department of Education. The Higher Education Act (1969) was replaced by the Colleges of Advanced Education Act (1975) which determined the operations of the Teachers College from that date. Bachelor of Education course was established in 1975 for students intending to become Industrial Arts of Home Economics teachers. A few years later the Bachelor of Education course extended to include the Humanities, Sciences and Mathematics.
The Teachers College continued to offer: (a) Diploma of Teaching; (b) Graduate Diploma in Education; (c) Graduate Diploma in Educational Studies; (d) Graduate Diploma in Adult Education; (e) Diploma Conversion courses in Technical Teacher Education. College staff worked with staff from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) to develop basic nursing and post basic nursing education programs, and participated in RPAH’s existing basing nursing training program.
By 1981, the College had established over the years, centres in specialist fields. By this year, they included: (a) Research Centre; (b) Sydney Human Performance Laboratory; (c) Audio Visual Centre; (d) Sydney Educational Museum Centre; (e) Curriculum Centre; (f) Multicultural Education Project.
But, on the 31 December 1981, Sydney Teachers College ceased to exist. It was succeeded by the Sydney Institute of Education which was part of Sydney College of Advanced Education. And, in 1990 the Sydney Institute of Education became part of the University of Sydney

Sydney College of Advanced Education

The Sydney College of Advanced Education was an educational institution in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia that existed from 1981 to 1989. The Commonwealth government announced recommendations for a consolidation of higher education provision in March 1981. This was welcomed by state governments; argued against by individual institutions, but the threatened loss of commonwealth funding dissipated much of this opposition. On 24 July 1981, Sydney College of Advanced Education (CAE) was established as a corporation under the Colleges of Advanced Education Act 1975 by the State Minister of Education. 
On the 1 January 1982 The Sydney CAE commenced operation. Participating colleges included: Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education; Guild Teachers College; Nursery School Teachers College; Sydney Kindergarten Teachers College; and, Sydney Teachers College. 
Institutes formed included: The Institute of Early Childhood Studies (Sydney Kindergarten Teachers College and Nursery School Teachers College); The Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education (aka ITATE) (formerly Sydney Teachers College Technical Education School); The City Art Institute (formerly the School of Art in the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education); The St George Institute of Education (formerly the School of Teacher Education in the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education); The Sydney Institute of Education (Sydney Teachers College); The Guild Centre (Guild Teachers College), designed for non-government education; not designated an Institute. In late 1984, the Institute of Nursing Studies became the 6th Institute of the Sydney CAE. 
The Mansfield Committee Report to the Higher Education Board (1985) following its review of the NSW Advanced Education sector’s provision for education in visual arts and design, responses to its recommendations eventually led to the CAI’s withdrawal from the Sydney CAE. In March 1987, it was announced that, from the start of 1988, the City Art Institute would join the East Sydney Art School and, with those parts of the Sydney College of the Arts not joining the University of Technology, Sydney, would become the NSW Institute of the Arts. 
In November 1988 a Council meeting decided to pursue disestablishment through a divestment model. The formal Closing Ceremony was held at the Darling Harbour Convention Centre on 3 November 1989. On 31 December 1989, Sydney CAE ceased to exist as a corporate body. The Constituent Institutes transferred to the four Sydney metropolitan universities. The individual institutes were amalgamated as follows: 
Sydney Institute of Education (University of Sydney) Institute of Nursing Studies (University of Sydney) Institute of Early Childhood Studies (Macquarie University) St George Institute of Education (University of New South Wales) Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education (University of Technology, Sydney)

La Belle Bête

La Belle Bête (known in English as Mad Shadows) is a French Canadian novel by Marie-Claire Blais, published in 1959.
This novel was written when Blais was twenty years old and was her first major literary work. The novel quickly established her as a revolutionary talent on the Quebec literary scene.
A harrowing pathology of the soul, Mad Shadows centres on a family group: Patrice, the beautiful and narcissistic son; his ugly and malicious sister, Isabelle-Marie; and Louise, their vain and uncomprehending mother. These characters inhabit an amoral universe where beauty reflects no truth and love is an empty delusion. With the closing passage of Mad Shadows, Marie-Claire Blais cleared the way for a new era in Quebec fiction.
The novel was later adapted into a ballet by the National Ballet of Canada in 1977, starring dancers Karen Kain, Veronica Tennant, and choreographed by Anne Ditchburn, with music by Andre Gagnon. It was later rerun for the company's 35th anniversary in 1987, and featured Cynthia Lucas and Tomas Schramek. 
Plot.
"La Belle Bête" starts off as the three main characters return home on a train. Immediately, the characters’ relationships with one another, as well as their physical beauty as a status, are established. As they return home, their daily activities reveal even more of their living situation with one another, as Isabelle-Marie is the Cinderella of the family, working hard and being neglected, while Louise fawns over her beloved beautiful Patrice. Patrice is so incompetent from his constant dependence on his mother, that he can do nothing but accept her attention. Eventually, Louise announces that she needs to travel to pick up farm equipment for their vast land, and leaves Patrice and Isabelle-Marie. Isabelle-Marie continues her distaste for her brother, and as her mother is no longer there to support Patrice, she takes the opportunity to let him starve to release her anger and jealously towards him As she grows to pity his incompetence and dependency on Louise, Isabelle-Marie begins to care for him ever so slightly.
When Louise returns, she brings with her Lanz, who becomes the new controlling figure over the family. Patrice rejoices and cleaves to his mother, but she can no longer respond with her attention as she is consumed by her own relationship with Lanz. As Lanz brings Louise further and further from her children, Patrice spirals into deterioration while Isabelle-Marie relishes her newfound freedom. As Isabelle-Marie becomes more upbeat, she learns to care for Patrice, as well as meets her lover Michael, who she convinces to love her by lying about her beauty .
From here the story splits into two. On one side of life, Isabelle-Marie begins her life with the blind Michael, while Patrice is continued to be neglected as Lanz demands the attention of Louise. Both children’s’ stories end in despair as Michael eventually regains his vision and comes to terms with the ugliness of Isabelle-Marie and consequently, their newborn child Anne. He abandons both of them and disappears from their lives. As the torn spirit of Isabelle-Marie returns to her unwanted home, she finds that Louise is being controlled by Lanz, and has chosen him over Patrice.
Her newfound anger towards outer beauty drives her to push Patrice’s face into a pot of boiling water, thus bringing his now beast-like face to her lowly status. Patrice cries to his mother, and she makes the ultimate choice to live her life with Lanz, abandoning Patrice entirely (pg 52). Patrice is sent to an insane asylum by Louise, who becomes fed up with his incompetence, however he escapes shortly afterwards. As their lives quickly become disillusioned, Isabelle-Marie ends up setting fire to the farm. Louise, who has slowly been cracking under the loss of her beautiful child, and the control – and eventual death - of her husband is lost in the fire. Isabelle-Marie commits suicide as she pushes her child off the train tracks that once brought her home, as Patrice drowns himself when he sees his hideous face in the reflection of a lake.

Stomp progression

In music and jazz harmony, the Stomp progression is an eight-bar chord progression named for its use in the "stomp" section of the composition "King Porter Stomp" (1923) by Jelly Roll Morton, later arranged by Fletcher Henderson. It was one of the most popular tunes of the swing era, and the Stomp progression was often used.
The progression is based on the last section of the piece, bars 57-64 in the original sheet music for piano or the "Fake Book" lead sheet, where the chords for the last 10 bars of the piece are:
In pieces where the progression is repeated, this becomes something like:
which is, ignoring the temporary tonicization of G, and treating the key as that of the trio and stomp sections, D:
The last two measures contain the ragtime progression.
Many bands and composers have used the Stomp chord progression to write new compositions, writing new head tunes or melodies, but using the chord changes to, as Morton phrased it, "make great tunes of themselves". Examples include Benny Carter's "Everybody Shuffle" (1934). See contrafact.

In addition, the company has several subsidiaries in the sugar industry. Complant Magbass Sugar Company is a subsidiary located in Sierra Leone that operates a sugar production facility, in Magbass, Tonkolili district, rehabilitated by the company in 2003. The sugar operations in Sierra Leone has enjoyed the support of the local traditional elder, Paramount Chief, Alhaji Masakama Kanamanka 111, who in a ceremony in November 2012 for the sugar facility lashed out at anybody under his domain who stole equipment or burned the crops of the company.
The company became a major investor in Jamaica in 2011 with the purchase of three sugar factories in a divestment by the government of Jamaica. The sugar factories were sold for 9 million USD with a planned investment of 156 million to follow the purchase in order to rehabilitate the factories. The company moved rapidly on the investment, investing 8 million USD in rehabilitation and buying 20 million USD in spare parts and materials before taking control of the facilities. For the Jamaican government, the goals behind the sale included improvement of efficiency in the transferred factories and, down the line, the transformation of the Jamaican sugar industry.

NuGrape is a brand of grape-flavored soda pop. The NuGrape brand was invented in 1906, first bottled in 1921, and by April 1933, The National NuGrape Company was founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1922, licensing rights were sold to the Olla Bottling Works in Olla, Louisiana where it was made and distributed for many years. NuGrape was followed up by the popular Sun Crest brand of soft drinks in 1938. In 1965, the National NuGrape Company introduced Kickapoo Joy Juice, a product based on Al Capp's Li'l Abner comic strip. All three brands were acquired in 1968 by The Moxie Company (renamed Moxie-Monarch-NuGrape Company and later Monarch Beverage Company). In 1970, Moxie-Monarch-NuGrape discontinued domestic U.S. sales of Kickapoo Joy Juice.
In 1999, NuGrape and the Nesbitt's line of carbonated drinks were acquired from Monarch Beverage Company in Atlanta by Big Red, Ltd. of Waco, Texas under its North American Beverages Products division, which also included Nesbitt's. The National NuGrape building still exists in Atlanta at 794 Ralph McGill Blvd., but is not open to the public.
Today, NuGrape is usually found in parts of the southeast United States. Specifically, it is sold in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, northwest Alabama, and the eastern half of Tennessee. NuGrape is almost impossible to find for sale west or north of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. However, NuGrape is bottled and distributed in central Kentucky by the Ale-8-1 Bottling Company of Winchester, KY.
It is most commonly available in small, novelty candy stores as well as independent grocery stores, available in bottles (glass or plastic) or cans. In recent years, Cracker Barrel restaurants have begun selling NuGrape, by the individual bottle and in six-packs. Cracker Barrel stores are some of the only places that carry NuGrape for sale outside of its usual region of sale.

Symphony No. 1 (Glazunov)

Alexander Glazunov wrote his Symphony No. 1 in E major, Op. 5, in 1881, when he was 16 years old. It was premiered the following year in St. Petersburg. It is known as his Slavonian Symphony.
Structure.
The symphony is written in four movements:
The symphony bears a strong stylistic semblance to works by Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, and especially Borodin. It was also influenced by Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony, a work which was highly regarded in the Balakirev circle.
Overview.
While the symphony itself was a resounding success, the audience was even more astonished to see a teenage boy come to the stage to take his bows in his school uniform. This was not the first time Alexander Glazunov had astounded people. He displayed his musical talent early, was discovered by Mily Balakirev (former leader of The Mighty Handful) and further encouraged by his teacher Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, who gave him a thorough grounding in counterpoint, form, harmony and orchestration between 1879 and 1881., during which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in his memoirs that it seemed Glazunov did not progress so much from day to day as from hour to hour. After two years, as Glazunov remembered, Rimsky-Korsakov told his pupil "that henceforth he regarded it as unnecessary to instruct me systematically, in return for payment, as I had already more or less become a mature musician."
Still, some remained skeptical, but not for long. When composer Sergei Taneyev told his friend Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky about the premiere of the First Symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev:
Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that this young man could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help.
Balakirev replied:
You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help."
Some months later, Tchaikovsky wrote that he had purchased and studied the score of Glazunov's First String Quartet, concluding that "Glazunov's talent is undeniable."
Truth be told, Glazunov did have a little help from Balakirev, but on just one point. The composer wrote in his memoirs, "I composed and orchestrated the slow movement of the "First Symphony" in the summer of 1881. In addition I played that passage to Balakirev, who approved of it in general but advised me to add something after the presentation of the two themes, before the repetition of the beginning. From the rhythmic figure that appears in the bars that I added, I created the contrapuntal accompaniment to the first theme, which lent the work a degree of rhythmic vitality. That autumn, the score of the symphony was ready."

Songs to Scream at the Sun

Songs to Scream at the Sun is the second and final studio album by American hardcore band Have Heart. The album debuted and peaked at No. 193 on the Billboard Top 200. The band announced their breakup the next year.
Reception.
Reviews of "Songs To Scream At The Sun" were generally favorable. AllMusic's Greg Prato said that "in a day and age when it's arguably more common than ever to start softening your sound in hopes of crossover success, there's something quite noble in Have Heart's approach... And even when Have Heart take the intensity down a notch or two -- such as on the track "Brotherly Love" -- it's still more intense than your average up-and-coming hardcore band," giving the album a 3.5/5. Casey Boland of Alternative Press had a similar review, noting that while the band's influences were obvious on 2006's "The Things We Carry", "they now stir them into a unique sound." Lambgoat had a 5/10 rating, however, and said, "It's only their sophomore album, but Boston's Have Heart are already having a pretty serious identity crisis... It's as if these guys are trying their hardest to prove that they're more than just a hardcore band but it's just not in their nature... Growth is all well and good but in this case, it feels forced in every way."

His repution grew as a renowned Canadian daredevil in 1930 with a five-hour journey in a steel barrel which began just below the falls at the Maid of the Mist boat landing and through the treacherous Niagara lower rapids ending up several miles down stream at Queenston, Ontario.

From a very early age Red was obsessed by both the Niagara River and the power of Niagara Falls and would spend most of his days tossing sticks, cans, rubber tubing and anything else that would float over the falls and along the river rather than attending school.
It was the study of how the various items floating over precipice of the falls and how they would reappear in the rapids below that would prove to be the vital source of knowledge that would bring the young Hill much notoriety and international fame later in life.
When Bobby Leach tempted fate by going over the great Horseshoe Falls in his crude steel barrel in 1910, it was Red Hill that retrieved the barrel and extracted the battered but otherwise healthy Leach from the steel conveyance. Hill would again come to the rescue of Leach following his failed attempt to swim the Niagara Gorge in 1920, just ten years after his plunge over the falls. Following Leach's rescue, Hill climbed into the barrel himself and proceeded down the Niagara Gorge rapids several miles downriver to Queenston, Ontario.
Challenging the Niagara Rapids.
Red Hill's second trip through the Niagara rapids came on May 30, 1930, this time choosing a steel barrel long and in diameter. The opening was a manhole, covered by sliding steel and sealed with rubber gaskets. There were air holes on each side, which were plugged with cork and could be removed. The contraption weighed over and was painted red with gold lettering that read “William Red Hill, Master Hero of Niagara” inscribed on both sides.
An estimated 25,000 spectators watched Hill attempt to conquer the rapids which got off to a slow start as the barrel bobbed and bucked in the raging river for an hour and forty minutes before arriving in the lower rapids. In less than 90 seconds he had entered the mighty Whirlpool with its extremely strong currents and become trapped as his barrel violently spun in circles for more than three hours. At one point he had opened the steel hatch and tried to paddle against the current to free himself, but to no avail. It was only through the efforts of his son William "Red" Hill Jr. who swam out to the floundering barrel with a rope attached to his waist the senior Hill survived.
The next day the 42 year old Hill went back to the whirlpool, retrieved his contraption and continued the final leg of his journey to Queenston, Ontario where he emerged triumphant, with only a few minor cuts and bruises.
Ice Bridge Collapse.
In the early part of the century thousands of tourists would venture out onto the ice bridge that forms in the pool at the base of the falls during extremely cold winters. On February 4, 1912 while operating a small shanty that served hot beverages and snacks on the frozen river to tourists that were visiting the "Ice bridge", he heard the ice below him tremble and he immediately sensed disaster.
He realized the ice was breaking up below and he frantically tried to wave the spectators to safety on the Canadian side. Realizing that four people were still on the ice, Red Hill Sr. returned and managed to pull one person, a young boy to safety.
Three others were not so lucky, and despite frantic efforts to drop ropes from the bridges, the three terrified people were swept to their deaths, their bodies never recovered. Had it not been for the quick actions of Red Hill Sr. that day the tragedy could have been much worse.
In the first World War Red Hill saw action in France, was awarded two more medals for bravery and returned to Canada in 1918. That was the year that saw Red Hill perform one of his most outstanding feats of bravery.
The Niagara Scow Incident.
On August 6, 1918, The Niagara Scow carrying two men broke its line, and the swift current in the upper river brought the scow within of the brink of the falls. The two quick-thinking men opened two latches on the bottom of the scow and grounded it on the jagged rocks. Darkness was approaching when the United States Coast Guard mounted their gun on the roof of the Toronto Power House and shot a rope to the scow.
A breeches buoy was then sent out but became tangled and snarled. Red Hill Sr. volunteered to try to reach the men. Using the rope, Red Hill Sr. set out at 3 a.m. with spotlights glaring to light his path. A wrong move on his part would bring almost certain death. Hand over hand Red Hill struggled against the fierce current to reach his destination, however, hindered by darkness, Hill was not able to untangle the ropes.
The rescue was called off until the light of day. By 8 a.m. Red Hill was again attempting to free the ropes, this time being successful. By 9:30 a.m. the men were being safely returned to the shore.
Today visitors to Niagara Falls can still see the old scow in place. Rusted and a haven for seagulls, few visitors ever hear about the near tragedy over the falls that day or of the heroic actions of a man that would forever hold the title as “Riverman”.
History and legacy.
He would make the journey down the Niagara River three more times before his death in 1942 at the age of 54. Hill was not only recognized for his trips down the lower rapids, but also for his love of the river. An avid “rivers man”, he allegedly pulled over 170 bodies from Niagara’s waters. He also participated in many rescue efforts of stranded individuals, saving the lives of 28 people who would have surely drowned if it had not been for his bravery.
Red Hill was the father of four sons, Red Hill Jr., Major (given name), Corky and Wesley. One of these sons would also play a role in the history of stunting at Niagara Falls.
During his later years Red Hill sold pictures of himself and displayed his barrel in a local souvenir shop. Red Hill Sr. died in a Niagara Falls, Ontario hospital from effects of the gassing that he sustained during the First World War. He was 54 years old.
Red Hill Sr. passed his love of the Niagara River onto his son William “Red” Hill Jr., who would make the trip down the lower rapids several times following in his father's footsteps. Hill Jr., however, had a bigger purpose for his feats, to raise funds for a memorial fund to honour his father. His stunts, however, would not raise sufficient funds and so he decided to increase the stakes by performing a stunt even his father would not attempt, taking a barrel over the Horseshoe Falls.
His son, Red Hill Jr.’s barrel was unlike any other, as it was constructed of 13 large inflated inner tubes that were held together by canvas webbing, encased by heavy-gauge fish netting. He had named his barrel “The Thing”, and on August 5, 1946 he set off at Chippawa, with thousands of curiosity seekers looking on. The trip started out as planned, as the barrel rode the upper rapids toward the brink of the Horseshoe Falls. The barrel made it over the cataract, however, it would not take long for onlookers to realize that the stunt had gone terribly wrong. “The Thing”, which had dropped , had shattered and broken apart from the pressure of the water and the great fall. Red Hill Jr. had not survived, and his battered body was found the next morning at the Maid of the Mist landing.
The character Tom Cole (local riverman and grandson of another famed riverman) from "The Day the Falls Stood Still", by Cathy Marie Buchanan was inspired by Red Hill Sr.

Swords and Deviltry

Swords and Deviltry is a fantasy short story collection by Fritz Leiber featuring his sword and sorcery heroes Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. It is chronologically the first volume in the complete seven volume edition of the collected stories devoted to the characters. The book was first published in paperback in 1970 by Ace Books, which reprinted the title numerous times through November 1985; later paperback editions were issued by ibooks (2003) and Dark Horse (2006). It has been published in the United Kingdom by New English Library (1971), Mayflower Books (1979) and Grafton (1986, 1988). The first hardcover edition was issued by Gregg Press in December 1977. The book has also been gathered together with others in the series into various omnibus editions; "The Three of Swords" (1989), "Ill Met in Lankhmar" (1995), "The First Book of Lankhmar" (2001), and "Lankhmar" (2008).
The book collects three short stories originally published in the magazines "Fantastic" for April 1970, "Fantastic Stories of Imagination" for October 1962, and "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" for April 1970, together with an "Induction" that originally appeared in the 1957 Fafhrd and Gray Mouser collection "Two Sought Adventure" (later expanded, minus the induction, as "Swords Against Death" (1970).
Plot.
The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories follow the lives of two larcenous but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of Nehwon. The pieces in "Swords and Deviltry" introduce the duo and their relationship ("Induction"), present incidents from their early lives in which they meet their first lady-loves (Fafhrd in "The Snow Women", the Gray Mouser in "The Unholy Grail"), and relate how afterwards in the city of Lankhmar the two met and allied themselves with each other, and lost their first loves through their defiance of the local Thieves' Guild ("Ill Met in Lankhmar").
Awards.
"Ill Met in Lankhmar" won the 1970 Nebula Award and the 1971 Hugo Award for best novella. "The Unholy Grail" was nominated for the 1963 Hugo Award for Short Fiction.
Sequel.
Robin Wayne Bailey later wrote an authorized sequel to this book, "Swords Against the Shadowland" (1998).

Facial trauma

Facial trauma, also called maxillofacial trauma, is any physical trauma to the face. Facial trauma can involve soft tissue injuries such as burns, lacerations and bruises, or fractures of the facial bones such as nasal fractures and fractures of the jaw, as well as trauma such as eye injuries. Symptoms are specific to the type of injury; for example, fractures may involve pain, swelling, loss of function, or changes in the shape of facial structures.
Facial injuries have the potential to cause disfigurement and loss of function; for example, blindness or difficulty moving the jaw can result. Although it is seldom life-threatening, facial trauma can also be deadly, because it can cause severe bleeding or interference with the airway; thus a primary concern in treatment is ensuring that the airway is open and not threatened so that the patient can breathe. Depending on the type of facial injury, treatment may include bandaging and suturing of open wounds, administration of ice, antibiotics and pain killers, moving bones back into place, and surgery. When fractures are suspected, radiography is used for diagnosis. Treatment may also be necessary for other injuries such as traumatic brain injury, which commonly accompany severe facial trauma.
In developed countries, the leading cause of facial trauma used to be motor vehicle accidents, but this mechanism has been replaced by interpersonal violence; however auto accidents still predominate as the cause in developing countries and are still a major cause elsewhere. Thus prevention efforts include awareness campaigns to educate the public about safety measures such as seat belts and motorcycle helmets, and laws to prevent drunk and unsafe driving. Other causes of facial trauma include falls, industrial accidents, and sports injuries.
Classification.
Soft tissue injuries include abrasions, lacerations, avulsions, bruises, burns and cold injuries.
Commonly injured facial bones include the nasal bone (the nose), the maxilla (the bone that forms the upper jaw), and the mandible (the lower jaw). The mandible may be fractured at its symphysis, body, angle, ramus, and condoyle. The zygoma (cheekbone) and the frontal bone (forehead) are other sites for fractures. Fractures may also occur in the bones of the palate and those that come together to form the orbit of the eye.
At the beginning of the 20th century, René Le Fort mapped typical locations for facial fractures; these are now known as Le Fort I, II, and III fractures (right). Le Fort I fractures, also called Guérin or horizontal maxillary fractures, involve the maxilla, separating it from the palate. Le Fort II fractures, also called pyramidal fractures of the maxilla, cross the nasal bones and the orbital rim. Le Fort III fractures, also called craniofacial disjunction and transverse facial fractures, cross the front of the maxilla and involve the lacrimal bone, the lamina papyracea, and the orbital floor, and often involve the ethmoid bone. are the most serious. Le Fort fractures, which account for 10–20% of facial fractures, are often associated with other serious injuries. Le Fort made his classifications based on work with cadaver skulls, and the classification system has been criticized as imprecise and simplistic since most midface fractures involve a combination of Le Fort fractures. Although most facial fractures do not follow the patterns described by Le Fort precisely, the system is still used to categorize injuries.
Causes.
Injury mechanisms such as falls, assaults, sports injuries, and vehicle crashes are common causes of facial trauma in children as well as adults. Blunt assaults, blows from fists or objects, are a common cause of facial injury. Facial trauma can also result from wartime injuries such as gunshots and blasts.
Animal attacks and work-related injuries such as industrial accidents are other causes. Vehicular trauma is one of the leading causes of facial injuries. Trauma commonly occurs when the face strikes a part of the vehicle's interior, such as the steering wheel. In addition, airbags can cause corneal abrasions and lacerations (cuts) to the face when they deploy.
Signs and symptoms.
Fractures of facial bones, like other fractures, may be associated with pain, bruising, and swelling of the surrounding tissues (such symptoms can occur in the absence of fractures as well). Fractures of the nose, base of the skull, or maxilla may be associated with profuse nosebleeds. Nasal fractures may be associated with deformity of the nose, as well as swelling and bruising. Deformity in the face, for example a sunken cheekbone or teeth which do not align properly, suggests the presence of fractures. Asymmetry can suggest facial fractures or damage to nerves. People with mandibular fractures often have pain and difficulty opening their mouths and may have numbness in the lip and chin. With Le Fort fractures, the midface may move relative to the rest of the face or skull. 
Diagnosis.
Radiography, imaging of tissues using X-rays, is used to rule out facial fractures. Angiography (X-rays taken of the inside of blood vessels) can be used to locate the source of bleeding. However the complex bones and tissues of the face can make it difficult to interpret plain radiographs; CT scanning is better for detecting fractures and examining soft tissues, and is often needed to determine whether surgery is necessary, but it is more expensive and difficult to obtain. CT scanning is usually considered to be more definitive and better at detecting facial injuries than X-ray. CT scanning is especially likely to be used in people with multiple injuries who need CT scans to assess for other injuries anyway.
Prevention.
Measures to reduce facial trauma include laws enforcing seat belt use and public education to increase awareness about the importance of seat belts and motorcycle helmets. Efforts to reduce drunk driving are other preventative measures; changes to laws and their enforcement have been proposed, as well as changes to societal attitudes toward the activity. Information obtained from biomechanics studies can be used to design automobiles with a view toward preventing facial injuries. While seat belts reduce the number and severity of facial injuries that occur in crashes, airbags alone are not very effective at preventing the injuries. In sports, safety devices including helmets have been found to reduce the risk of severe facial injury. Additional attachments such as face guards may be added to sports helmets to prevent orofacial injury (injury to the mouth or face). mouth guards also used,
Treatment.
An immediate need in treatment is to ensure that the airway is open and not threatened (for example by tissues or foreign objects), because airway compromisation can occur rapidly and insidiously, and is potentially deadly. Material in the mouth that threatens the airway can be removed manually or using a suction tool for that purpose, and supplemental oxygen can be provided. Facial fractures that threaten to interfere with the airway can be reduced by moving the bones back into place; this both reduces bleeding and moves the bone out of the way of the airway. Tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the airway to assist breathing) may be difficult or impossible due to swelling. Nasal intubation, inserting an endotracheal tube through the nose, may be contraindicated in the presence of facial trauma because if there is an undiscovered fracture at the base of the skull, the tube could be forced through it and into the brain. If facial injuries prevent oraotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, a surgical airway can be placed to provide an adequate airway. Although cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy can secure an airway when other methods fail, they are used only as a last resort because of potential complications and the difficulty of the procedures.
A dressing can be placed over wounds to keep them clean and to facilitate healing, and antibiotics may be used in cases where infection is likely. People with contaminated wounds who have not been immunized against tetanus within five years may be given a tetanus vaccination. Lacerations may require stitches to stop bleeding and facilitate wound healing with as little scarring as possible. Although it is not common for bleeding from the maxillofacial region to be profuse enough to be life threatening, it is still necessary to control such bleeding. Severe bleeding occurs as the result of facial trauma in 1–11% of patients, and the origin of this bleeding can be difficult to locate. Nasal packing can be used to control nose bleeds and hematomas that may form on the septum between the nostrils. Such hematomas need to be drained. Mild nasal fractures need nothing more than ice and pain killers, while breaks with severe deformities or associated lacerations may need further treatment, such as moving the bones back into alignment and antibiotic treatment.
Treatment aims to repair the face's natural bony architecture and to leave as little apparent trace of the injury as possible. Fractures may be repaired with metal plates and screws. They may also be wired into place. Bone grafting is another option to repair the bone's architecture, to fill out missing sections, and to provide structural support. Medical literature suggests that early repair of facial injuries, within hours or days, results in better outcomes for function and appearance.
Surgical specialists who commonly treat specific aspects of facial trauma are oral and maxillofacial surgeons. These surgeons are trained in the comprehensive management of trauma to the lower, middle and upper face and have to take written and oral board examinations covering the management of facial injuries.
Prognosis and complications.
By itself, facial trauma rarely presents a threat to life; however it is often associated with dangerous injuries, and life-threatening complications such as blockage of the airway may occur.
The airway can be blocked due to bleeding, swelling of surrounding tissues, or damage to structures. Burns to the face can cause swelling of tissues and thereby lead to airway blockage. Broken bones such as combinations of nasal, maxillary, and mandibular fractures can interfere with the airway. Blood from the face or mouth, if swallowed, can cause vomiting, which can itself present a threat to the airway because it has the potential to be aspirated. Since airway problems can occur late after the initial injury, it is necessary for healthcare providers to monitor the airway regularly.
Even when facial injuries are not life threatening, they have the potential to cause disfigurement and disability, with long-term physical and emotional results. Facial injuries can cause problems with eye, nose, or jaw function and can threaten eyesight. 
As early as 400 BC, Hippocrates is thought to have recorded a relationship between blunt facial trauma and blindness. Injuries involving the eye or eyelid, such as retrobulbar hemorrhage, can threaten eyesight; however, blindness following facial trauma is not common.
Incising wounds of the face may involve the parotid duct. This is more likely if the wound crosses a line drawn between the tragus of the ear to the upper lip. The approximate location of the course of the duct is the middle third of this line.
Nerves and muscles may be trapped by broken bones; in these cases the bones need to be put back into their proper places quickly. For example, fractures of the orbital floor or medial orbital wall of the eye can entrap the medial rectus or inferior rectus muscles. In facial wounds, tear ducts and nerves of the face may be damaged. Fractures of the frontal bone can interfere with the drainage of the frontal sinus and can cause sinusitis.
Infection is another potential complication, for example when debris is ground into an abrasion and remains there. Injuries resulting from bites carry a high infection risk.
Epidemiology.
As many as 50–70% of people who survive traffic accidents have facial trauma. In most developed countries, violence from other people has replaced vehicle collisions as the main cause of maxillofacial trauma; however in many developing countries traffic accidents remain the major cause. Increased use of seat belts and airbags has been credited with a reduction in the incidence of maxillofacial trauma, but fractures of the mandible (the jawbone) are not decreased by these protective measures. The risk of maxillofacial trauma is decreased by a factor of two with use of motorcycle helmets. A decline in facial bone fractures due to vehicle accidents is thought to be due to seat belt and drunk driving laws, strictly enforced speed limits and use of airbags. In vehicle accidents, drivers and front seat passengers are at highest risk for facial trauma.
Facial fractures are distributed in a fairly normal curve by age, with a peak incidence occurring between ages 20 and 40, and children under 12 suffering only 5–10% of all facial fractures. Most facial trauma in children involves lacerations and soft tissue injuries. There are several reasons for the lower incidence of facial fractures in children: the face is smaller in relation to the rest of the head, children are less often in some situations associated with facial fractures such as occupational and motor vehicle hazards, there is a lower proportion of cortical bone to cancellous bone in children's faces, poorly developed sinuses make the bones stronger, and fat pads provide protection for the facial bones.
Head and brain injuries are commonly associated with facial trauma, particularly that of the upper face; brain injury occurs in 15–48% of people with maxillofacial trauma. Coexisting injuries can affect treatment of facial trauma; for example they may be emergent and need to be treated before facial injuries. People with trauma above the level of the collar bones are considered to be at high risk for cervical spine injuries (spinal injuries in the neck) and special precautions must be taken to avoid movement of the spine, which could worsen a spinal injury.

Focus recovery based on the linear canonical transform

Focus recovery from a defocused image is an ill-posed problem since it loses the component of high frequency. Most of the methods for focus recovery are based on depth estimation theory. The Linear canonical transform (LCT) gives a scalable kernel to fit many famous optical effects. Using LCTs to approximate an optical system for imaging and inverting this system, theoretically permits recovery of a defocused image.
Depth of field and perceptual focus.
In photography, depth of field (DOF) means an effective focal length. It is usually used for stressing an object and deemphasizing the background (and/or the foreground). The important measure related to DOF is the lens aperture. Decreasing the diameter of aperture increases focus and lowers resolution and vice versa.
The Huygens-Fresnel principle and DOF.
The Huygens-Fresnel principle describes diffraction of wave propagation between two fields. It belongs to Fourier optics rather than geometric optics.The disturbance of diffraction depends on two circumstance parameters, the size of aperture and the interfield distance.
Consider a source field and a destination field, field 1 and field 0, respectively. P1(x1,y1) is the position in the source field, P0(x0,y0) is the position in the destination field. The Huygens-Fresnel principle gives the diffraction formula for two fields U(x0,y0), U(x1,y1) as following:
where θ denotes the angle between formula_2 and formula_3. Replace cosθ by formula_4 and formula_2 by 
formula_6
we get
The further distance "z" or the smaller aperture "(x1,y1)" causes a greater diffraction. A larger DOF can lead to a more effective focused wave distribution. This seems to be a conflict. Here are the notations:
In conclusion, diffraction explains a micro behavior whereas DOF shows a macro behavior. Both of them are related to aperture size.
Linear canonical transform.
As the meaning of “canonical”, the linear canonical transform (LCT) is a scalable transform that connects to lots of important kernels such as the Fresnel transform, Fraunhofer transform and the fractional Fourier transform. It can be easily controlled by its four parameters, "a", "b", "c", "d" (3 degrees of freedom). The definition:
where
Consider a general imaging system with object distance "z0", focal length of the thin lens "f" and an imaging distance "z1". The effect of the propagation in freespace acts as nearly a chirp convolution, that is, the formula of diffraction. Besides, the effect of the propagation in thin lens acts as a chirp multiplication. The parameters are all simplified as paraxial approximations while meeting the freespace propagation. It does not consider aperture size.
From the properties of the LCT, it is possible to obtain those 4 parameters for this optical system as:
Once the values of "z1", "z0" and "f" are known, the LCT can simulate any optical system.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Ghana

As of January 1, 2012, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported 48,578 members, 8 stakes and 5 districts, 129 congregations (72 wards, 57 branches), 2 missions, and 1 temple in Ghana.
History.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) was not officially established in Ghana until 1978. However from 1969–1978 there were congregations using this name, following the Book of Mormon and hoping to be able to receive the missionaries and ordinances of the church. One of the main leaders of this group was Billy Johnson. These groups did receive recognition by the government of Ghana in 1969.
In 1978, Spencer W. Kimball received the revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy male members of the church regardless of race or color. After this, the church decided to open missions in West Africa. Merrill J. Bateman, a Brigham Young University economics professor who had often traveled to Ghana to study the cocoa industry, and Edwin Q. "Ted" Cannon made an initial trip to Ghana and Nigeria in the summer of 1978 and contacted many members of these churches that wanted to join with the LDS Church.
In November 1978, Cannon returned to Africa as a missionary with his wife Janath Cannon and in December they went to Ghana. Here they baptized most of the pople who had been affiliated with the various groups using the church's name and from this point on congregations under the name The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located in Ghana were part of the church headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
In 1985 Ghana was made into its own mission, previously it was under the mission headquartered in Nigeria. The government of Ghana outlawed all activities of the LDS Church on 14 June 1989 claiming it was a front for the CIA. During the following period known as "the freeze" Emanuel Abu Kissi headed the Church in Ghana with Billy Johnson and his wife being the only missionaries. Members could hold sacrament meetings in their homes on a family basis, but no regular ward meetings were held and the LDS Church could not collect tithing. In November 1990 the government lifted the freeze having become convinced the Latter-day Saints were loyal citizens. On 21 April 1991 two stakes were organized in Ghana, one in Accra and the other in Cape Coast. From 1991 until 2007 the Ghana mission also covered Sierra Leone and Liberia. In 2005 Ghana was divided into two missions, with a new mission based in Cape Coast also covering Togo and Benin. 
There is one temple of the church in Ghana, the Accra Ghana Temple, which was opened in 2004.
Temple.
On January 11, 2004 the Accra Ghana Temple was dedicated by President Gordon B. Hinckley.

A Dispatch from Reuter's

"A Dispatch from Reuter's" is a 1940 biographical film about Paul Reuter, the man who built the famous news service that bears his name.
Plot.
Paul Julius Reuter (Edward G. Robinson) starts a messenger service using homing pigeons to fill a gap in the telegraph network spanning Europe, but has difficulty convincing anyone to subscribe. When poison is sent to a hospital by mistake, Reuter's message saves the day (and many lives). However, he is persuaded by Ida Magnus (Edna Best), the pretty daughter of Dr. Magnus (Otto Kruger), to keep it quiet, as a scandal would undo all the good work the doctors are doing.
Finally though, Reuter is finally able to convince bankers that he can provide them with financial information much more quickly than by any other means. He is particularly pleased and surprised by how reliable his lifelong, lackadaisical friend Max Wagner (Eddie Albert) has become at the Brussels office, until his associate Franz Geller (Albert Bassermann) informs him that Ida had, while there on a visit, taken over and run the place. Reuter sends a message by pigeon, asking her to marry him. She sends one back with her assent.
When the telegraph network finally fills the gap Reuter's business had been exploiting, he realizes that he can use the employees he has in place all over Europe to gather the news and sell it to the newspapers. Once again, he encounters resistance, particularly from John Delane (Montagu Love), influential editor of "The Times", but overcomes it by persuading Louis Napoleon III (Walter Kingsford) to allow him to disseminate the text of an extremely important speech at the same time as it is being presented.
Later, a rival company appears; Anglo Irish secretly builds a telegraph line in Ireland that gives it a two hour lead in getting news from ships coming from America. Reuter borrows money from his client and good friend, Sir Randolph Persham (Nigel Bruce), and builds his own line, one that extends further west and gets the news even quicker. Its first use is to announce the assassination of President Lincoln. As nobody knows about Reuter's new telegraph line, he is accused of making the tragedy up in order to manipulate the stock market; even Sir Randolph believes the rumors at first. The matter is brought up in the British Parliament, but Reuter is vindicated when slower services confirm his story.

Rookie of the Year (band)

Rookie of the Year is an indie rock/acoustic band from Fayetteville, North Carolina . They were signed to One Eleven Records, though the fourth release of their latest EP fulfilled their contractual obligation to 111 and allow them to sign with a new label. The band is fronted by lead singer/songwriter Ryan Dunson(8-13-86). The band has seen many recent "live band" line-up changes, with Dunson being the sole remaining member from the start of 2010.
Biography.
The band was formed in 2005 as a solo project of singer Ryan Dunson(8-13-86). Dunson signed with Vice Verse Virtue Records, a Tennessee record label, in late 2005. Soon after, Dunson signed to One Eleven Records, releasing a 1000-copy EP called "Late Night Makeout". In 2005 One Eleven Records released the band's first record, "Having to Let Go", as a 13-track LP. In 2005, OneEleven Records re-released the album as a ten-track LP. After expanding to a five-piece, their second album, "The Goodnight Moon", was released in April 2006. Following this release, they toured through North America on the Warped Tour, as well as with groups like Relient K, Mae, Secondhand Serenade, PlayRadioPlay, The Graduate, My American Heart, Monday in London, The Rocket Summer, Dave Melillo, Cute Is What We Aim For, Love Me Electric, Blackpool Lights, Four Letter Lie, As Cities Burn, We Are the Fury, Scenes from a Movie, Mutemath, Copeland, Mest, Quietdrive, Under the Influence of Giants, Upper Class Trash and label mates The Spill Canvas, This Day & Age, and Rory. 
Their last full length record so far "Sweet Attention" was released on August 5, 2008 on One Eleven Records. Over the next 12 months, the band toured non-stop promoting the release, including two headlining tours as well as a prominent tour supporting reunited boy-band LFO. Over the course of the tour, 3 of the band members who participated in the recording of Sweet Attention left the band and were replaced with new musicians.
June 7, 2010 released is an 8 track EP titled The Most Beautiful, featuring the singles "Turn the Page" and "Frustrated", was featured on the front page of purevolume.com. This record is available on iTunes.
January 11, 2012, Rookie of the Year release an Acoustic/EP called Along for the Ride featuring the song Dallas.

Mount Blakiston is a mountain in the southwestern corner of Alberta, Canada and the highest point within Waterton Lakes National Park. The mountain is situated in the Clark Range, north of Lineham Creek and south of Blakiston Creek. The Lineham Creek hiking trail passes along the foot of the southern slopes of the mountain and for capable scramblers, Blakiston's rubbly but steep southern slopes provide a suitable line of ascent.
Blakiston's closest neighbours include Mount Hawkins directly to the west along a connecting ridge and Mount Lineham to the south.
The mountain was named in 1858 for Thomas Blakiston, a member of the Palliser Expedition.

The Lake Wobegon Trails are two paved recreational rail trails in central Minnesota, named after the fictional Lake Wobegon in Garrison Keillor's "Prairie Home Companion". Each trail is marked with mileposts every , corresponding with the mile markers of the former railroad lines. Snowmobile use is allowed on the trail in winter, conditions permitting.
Main trail.
The main trail is a trail along a former Burlington Northern Railroad line, beginning near milepost 81 in St. Joseph and ending near milepost 130 in Osakis. This trail runs parallel to I-94. The trail passes through the cities of Avon, Albany, Freeport, Melrose, Sauk Centre, and West Union. Beyond Osakis, the trail continues as the Central Lakes Trail. These two trails form a continuous trail from St. Joseph to Fergus Falls. The extension trail intersects near milepost 97 of the main trail in Albany.
Extension trail.
The extension trail is a trail along a former Soo Line Railroad line, beginning near milepost 131 in Albany passing through Albany, Krain and Holding Townships and ending northeast of Holdingford at approx. milepost 143.5, passing through Holdingford. This bicycle trail continues beyond milepost 143.5 as the Soo Line Trail, crossing the Mississippi River at the Blanchard Dam, changing from asphalt to gravel at U.S. 10 south of Little Falls, and extending to Onamia. The Soo Line Trail traverses Morrison County and Mille Lacs County.

Time Passages (song)

"Time Passages" is the title of a 1978 US Top Ten hit by singer-songwriter Al Stewart which was produced by Alan Parsons and was the title track for Stewart's 1978 album release. The single reached No. 7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in December 1978, "Time Passages" also spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the "Billboard" Easy Listening chart, the longest stay at number one on this chart in the 1970s. 
A radio edit of the song was often played instead of the album version, which is over six minutes long; however, both versions were heard over the airwaves during the late 1970s. The familiar final line to the chorus is, "Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight". Less lyrically complex than a typical Al Stewart composition - the singer's previous Top Ten hit "Year of the Cat" exemplifying his usual style - "Time Passages" was one of two songs on the "Time Passages" album written by Stewart with the intent of the tracks having hit single potential, the other being "Song on the Radio" which was the follow-up single and reached No. 29.

Mathematical descriptions of opacity

When an electromagnetic wave travels through a medium in which it gets absorbed (this is called an "opaque" or "attenuating" medium), it undergoes exponential decay as described by the Beer–Lambert law. However, there are many possible ways to characterize the wave and how quickly it is absorbed. This article describes the mathematical relationships among:
Note that in many of these cases there are multiple, conflicting definitions and conventions in common use. This article is not necessarily comprehensive or universal.
Background: Unattenuated wave.
A electromagnetic wave propagating in the +"z"-direction is conventionally described by the equation:
formula_1
where
The wavelength is, by definition,
For a given frequency, the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave is affected by the material in which it is propagating. The "vacuum" wavelength (the wavelength that a wave of this frequency would have if it were propagating in vacuum) is
("c" is the speed of light in vacuum). In the absence of attenuation, the index of refraction (also called refractive index) is the ratio of these two wavelengths, i.e.,
The intensity of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude, time-averaged over many oscillations of the wave, which amounts to:
Note that this intensity is independent of the location "z", a sign that "this" wave is not attenuating with distance. We define "I"0 to equal this constant intensity:
Complex conjugate ambiguity.
Because
either expression can be used interchangeably. Generally, physicists and chemists use the convention on the left (with formula_9), while electrical engineers use the convention on the right (with formula_10, for example see electrical impedance). The distinction is irrelevant for an unattenuated wave, but becomes relevant in some cases below. For example, there are two definitions of complex refractive index, one with a positive imaginary part and one with a negative imaginary part, derived from the two different conventions. The two definitions are complex conjugates of each other.
Absorption coefficient.
One way to incorporate attenuation into the mathematical description of the wave is via an absorption coefficient:
where formula_12 is the absorption coefficient. The intensity in this case satisfies:
i.e.,
The absorption coefficient, in turn, is simply related to several other quantities:
Penetration depth, skin depth.
A very similar approach uses the penetration depth:
where formula_17 is the penetration depth.
The skin depth formula_18 is defined so that the wave satisfies:
where formula_18 is the skin depth.
Physically, the penetration depth is the distance which the wave can travel before its "intensity" reduces by a factor of formula_22. The skin depth is the distance which the wave can travel before its "amplitude" reduces by that same factor.
The absorption coefficient is related to the penetration depth and skin depth by
Complex wavenumber, propagation constant.
Another way to incorporate attenuation is to use essentially the original expression:
but with a complex wavenumber (as indicated by writing it as formula_25 instead of "k"). Then the intensity of the wave satisfies:
i.e.,
Therefore, comparing this to the absorption coefficient approach,
("k" is the standard (real) angular wavenumber, as used in any of the previous formulations.) In accordance with the ambiguity noted above, some authors use the complex conjugate definition, formula_30
A closely related approach, especially common in the theory of transmission lines, uses the propagation constant:
where formula_33 is the propagation constant.
Comparing the two equations, the propagation constant and complex wavenumber are related by:
(where the * denotes complex conjugation), or more specifically:
Unfortunately, the notation is not always consistent. For example, formula_25 is sometimes called "propagation constant" instead of formula_33, which swaps the real and imaginary parts.
Complex refractive index, extinction coefficient.
Recall that in nonattenuating media, the refractive index and wavenumber are related by:
A complex refractive index can therefore be defined in terms of the complex wavenumber defined above:
In other words, the wave is required to satisfy
Comparing to the preceding section, we have
The real part of formula_46 is often (ambiguously) called simply the "refractive index". The imaginary part is called the extinction coefficient.
In accordance with the ambiguity noted above, some authors use the complex conjugate definition, where the (still positive) extinction coefficient is "minus" the imaginary part of formula_46.
Complex permittivity.
In nonattenuating media, the permittivity and refractive index are related by:
where formula_50 is the permeability and formula_51 is the permittivity. In attenuating media, the same relation is used, but the permittivity is allowed to be a complex number, called complex permittivity:
Squaring both sides and using the results of the previous section gives:
(this is in SI; in cgs, drop the formula_56 and formula_57).
This approach is also called the complex dielectric constant; the dielectric constant is synonymous with formula_58 in SI, or simply formula_51 in cgs.
AC conductivity.
Another way to incorporate attenuation is through the conductivity, as follows.
One of the equations governing electromagnetic wave propagation is the Maxwell-Ampere law:
where D is the displacement field. Plugging in Ohm's law and the definition of (real) permittivity
where formula_64 is the (real, but frequency-dependent) conductivity, called AC conductivity. With sinusoidal time dependence on all quantities, i.e. formula_65 and formula_66, the result is
If the current J was not included explicitly (through Ohm's law), but only implicitly (through a complex permittivity), the quantity in parentheses would be simply the complex permittivity. Therefore,
Comparing to the previous section, the AC conductivity satisfies

Dan-el Padilla Peralta

Dan-el Padilla Peralta (also, Dan-el Padilla) is the 2006 Latin salutatorian of Princeton University. An undocumented immigrant from the Dominican Republic, he rose from poverty and homelessness to show promise, according to one faculty member, as "one of the best classicists to emerge in his generation".
Family and childhood.
Padilla and his family entered the United States legally in 1989, when Padilla was four years old, on a six-month temporary visa, so that his mother could obtain emergency medical care arising from diabetes-related pregnancy complications. In need of continuing care, the family applied for a further visa extension but never heard back from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Padilla's father, unable to find work, returned to the Dominican Republic while his mother overstayed her visa to raise Padilla and his infant brother in homeless shelters in New York City.
In 1994 Padilla, then living with his family in a shelter in Bushwick, Brooklyn, met photographer Jeff Cowen, who took an interest in the young boy. With Cowen's tutelage and encouragement Padilla won a scholarship to Cowen's alma mater high school, Collegiate School in Manhattan At Collegiate Padilla learned Greek, Latin, and French, participated in debate tournaments, and was described by an administrator as "one of the most powerful intellects" to ever attend the school.
Padilla applied for early admission to Princeton and was accepted in December, 2001. He admitted on his application that he did not have legal status in the United States. Princeton nevertheless awarded him a full scholarship out of its own funds (because federal aid programs are not available to non-residents). At Princeton Padilla earned a 3.9 grade point average, and was named salutatorian of his class. He majored in Classics, studying ancient Rome and Greece, despite having never been to Europe. He often took twice the normal course load. At the 2006 commencement ceremony, he delivered the traditional address in Latin. His mother, at the time, lived in Harlem and worked as a maid.
Immigration status.
Padilla's case.
In early 2006 Padilla won a two-year scholarship for a second bachelor's degree at Worcester College of Oxford University Attending Oxford would require Padilla to leave the United States, upon which he would likely be unable to return legally due to having no visa. Due to his having been in the United States illegally, if discovered, he would have been unable to apply for ten years. Further, without a work visa he would be unable to find work in the United States as a scholar and professor, his intended occupation. Padilla raised $10,000 from his friends for legal support and, in early April 2006, applied for a visa under a United States program allowing visa grants to illegal immigrants under "extraordinary circumstances". Despite personal appeals from Senator Hillary Clinton (whose husband, Bill Clinton called President George W. Bush on the subject), Charles Schumer, Charlie Rangel, Jane Harman, Mark Dayton, and other members of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, the deans of the Harvard Law School and the Woodrow Wilson School, asking Michael Chertoff and Emilio Gonzalez to personally review Padilla's file, Citizenship and Immigration Services (the agency now responsible for issuing visas) declined to consider his application.
In April 2007 Padilla was issued a one-year H-1B Visa allowing him to work as a research assistant at Princeton while attending Oxford. As of March, 2008, Padilla's longer-term visa status remained on appeal. As of March 2012 Padilla was a Ph.D. student in Classics at Stanford University.
National context.
In 2006, an estimated 65,000 illegal immigrant students, out of a total population of 2 million illegal residents under the age of 18, graduated from high school in the United States. Approximately 10-15% attended college.
There is no law prohibiting colleges from accepting illegal immigrants or requiring them to report them to authorities. However, they are ineligible for federal financial aid programs, subject to deportation if discovered, and ineligible for employment upon graduation. Princeton has no official policy on undocumented students, but has rejected otherwise qualified students for being in the United States illegally.
Along with his academic and political supporters Padilla campaigned unsuccessfully in 2006 for passage of the DREAM Act, which would have allowed highly qualified high school graduates who had been illegal immigrants since childhood, to become legal residents if they agreed to attend college or served in the United States Armed Forces. The bill had been introduced several times since 2001, but never obtained enough support to overcome filibusters.
Padilla's story attracted the attention of Hollywood, leading to interest in movie rights and a book deal. Padilla's younger brother, Yando, is a United States citizen, by virtue of his birth in the United States.

At the pinnacle of the conflict Franks resigns as head of ED with Oliver pushing for Zoe to become the new head of the ED. A short time later, Oliver discovers how closely knit the ED team are and pleads that Frank returns to hold the ED together. Zoe leaves All Saints hospital for a position at St Angela's. Mike donates his kidney
to his son. Erica disappears and is found murdered and Dan also disappears.
Mark Priestley's Death.
Actor Mark Priestley, who played Dan Goldman on the show, took his own life on 27 August 2008. As a result the show's final two episodes had to be re-filmed. It is presumed that the nature of these episodes, in which Dan's on-screen girlfriend goes missing, led Dan to suicide. The Seven Network paid tribute with a video clip in the following episode, along with actor John Howard in a plea to all those suffering from depression to get help.
As a result of Dan's death, the on-screen girlfriend, played by Jolene Anderson was killed off the show as Jolene believed she could not go on playing the role. Dan's final episode was aired on 18 November.
Controversy.
The Seven Network faced potential legal action after the airing of episode 432, "Never Tell" on 27 May 2008. The episode suggested that children with Down Syndrome are a result of incestuous relationships, provoking advocacy group Down Syndrome Australia to lodge a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Australian Communications and Media Authority, insisting that major advertisers in the show's timeslot boycott it and asking for a public apology from Seven. In the episode, a brother and sister are told that their unborn child is at risk of developing Down Syndrome as a result of their sexual relationship - according to Down Syndrome Australia, there is no evidence to support such a claim:
Seven responded with an apology through a newspaper on 2 June.
Down Syndrome Australia rejected the apology on 3 June, saying that the Seven Network's response was insufficient.:

Variav

Variav is a small village situated in Surat District, Gujarat, India. Variav is on the right bank of Tapti River. Variav was recently added to the region of Surat Municipal Corporation, and is now a suburb of Greater Surat.
History.
Variav is an ancient town of some historical importance. As early as the seventh century CE it may have been known as a place of migration of Zoroastrians fleeing the fall of the Sassanid Empire. The arrival of Zoroastrians in India is documented in Qissa-i Sanjan, and the date of first arrival is variously interpreted as being 936 AD, 765 AD and 716 AD. 
Many centuries later, after Mahmud Begada conquered the partially Parsi city of Sanjan (Gujarat) in the 1480s, Variav was one of many towns and villages that received a further influx of Parsis, along with Navsari, Surat, Wankaner, Ankleshwar, Bharuch and Khambhat to the north of Sanjan and Thane to the south.
According to P. P. Balsara s "Highlights of Parsi History", published in 1963, Variav is renowned for one other historical snippet. Towards the end of the 11th century the Parsi settlement at Variav refused to pay taxes to the Rajput prince of the area. The prince sent a force to the town that arrived while the men were away. The Parsi women fought the Rajputs. One of the women lost her helmet, and the Rajputs, seeing that they were fighting women, rallied. The Parsi women drowned themselves in the river rather than risk capture. This event is still remembered with a ceremony performed in Surat every year.
Demographics & Migration.
Variav is home to a mixed population of Sunni Muslim Vohra, Parsi, and various castes of Hindu.
Most of the Sunni Muslim Vohra population migrated to Burma (now Myanmar) where they flourished as a business community, while many maintain significant links back to Variav. In many cases, this included maintenance of houses. It was a similar story for the Parsi community, almost all of whom migrated to Mumbai and other parts of India. Both communities can now be found scattered throughout the world.
From early times Variavwala were interested in trade and commerce and travelled to foreign lands, undertaking long sea voyages. People left Variav in the early 19th century to settle in Burma, where they established many businesses and were great entrepreneurs; a number of them even became advisors to the Burmese rulers. 
Then came the migration to England from the 1950s to the 1970s, a number then left for Canada particularly during the period from the 1970s to the 1990s. Similarly for USA, a considerable number of Variavwala migrated to many other countries. They are now in UK, USA, Canada, Burma, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, UAE, France, South Africa etc. and many more. 
Despite the fact that Variav is only a small village, its people have made valuable contributions in societies around the world. Variavwala have always been great philanthropists and have set up many Waqfs or Religious Foundations to help poor, needy, disadvantaged and unfortunate members of society, particularly in Burma and in Variav itself.
The largest population of Variavwala outside India is in UK, where the community settled in the 1950s and 1960s.
Amenities.
Variav has its own drinking water tank from 1903 AD set up by Ebrahim Madha of the Sunni Vohra community. The actual machinery was imported from Belgium.
In terms of religious establishments, there are four mosques, one madrassa, and one big Jain Derashar, as well as several Hindu temples. Other public facilities include two government-run schools and a library. One reader commented that “Variav Mehfil-e-Nurl-Islam library is the second oldest Library in Gujarat”. The Library is managed by Variav Sunni Vohra Jamat. Variav Library is located on a bank of river Tapi, and has the best view on both sides.

Mercy Cherono

Mercy Cherono (born 7 May 1991 in Kericho) is a Kenyan long-distance runner. She was the silver medalist in the 5000 metres at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics.
She is a two-time world junior champion in the 3000 metres (2008, 2010) and has also won gold medals at the 2007 World Youth Championships in Athletics and 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games. She has been a success junior athlete in cross country running, taking the silver medals in the junior team and individual competitions at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and improving to the gold medals at the 2010 edition.
Career.
Cherono made her first international appearance at the 2007 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Mombasa and she finished 23rd in the junior race. She reached her first international podium at the 2007 World Youth Championships as she ran a championship record time of 8:53.94 to win the gold medal in the 3000 metres. She had a successful cross county season at the end of the year, taking 6 km junior race victories in three of the Athletics Kenya meetings. She had back-to-back wins in the junior race at the Tuskys Wareng Cross Country in 2007 and 2008.
She did not receive selection for the 2008 World Cross Country Championships, but instead focused on track running. First she added a junior title to her youth 3000 m win, beating Bizunesh Urgesa in a time of 8:58.07 to win the gold at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Bydgoszcz, and then she won the gold at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games, running largely uncontested to set a Games record time.
Her place on the Kenyan world cross country team looked uncertain in 2009 as head coach Julius Kirwa dismissed her chances, saying she had run too many races that season. Cherono replied by taking the lead immediately at the Kenyan Trials and winning the junior race by a margin of thirteen seconds. At the 2009 World Cross Country Championships in Amman, Cherono engaged in a race-long duel with Genzebe Dibaba in the junior race. Cherono took the lead in the final stages but a difficult stretch with a 40-metre climb enabled Dibaba to overtake her and Cherono ended up with the silver medal. At the 2009 African Junior Athletics Championships, Cherono eased to the 3000 m title by some 13 seconds but found herself beaten again by Genzebe Dibaba in 5000 m race, finishing with the silver medal. She competed on the senior track circuit that year and was third at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, recording a personal best of 8:44.67 for the 300 m. She took third for a second time at the Memorial van Damme in September, recording personal bests in the 1500 metres and 2000 metres and beaten only by reigning world champions Gelete Burka and Vivian Cheruiyot.
She won a junior cross country race on home turf in Kericho in late 2009, but failed to reach the top three at the 2010 Kenyan Trials. Her fourth place finish was enough to gain a place on the team for the 2010 World Cross Country Championships. Cherono rose to the occasion at the World Championships in Bydgoszcz, the same location as her 2008 World Junior win. She led with her Kenyan team-mates for much of the race and she won by a margin of seven seconds, leading home a 1-2-3-4 victory for the Kenyan team. Despite the significant winning margin, she did not need to push herself to the victory, later saying: "In the second lap, I had a lot left". She made her first outing on the IAAF Diamond League circuit in May, running a personal best of 14:47.13 for seventh in the 5000 metres at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. At the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics, Cherono became the first woman to retain the 3000 m junior title as she held off a challenge from Emebet Anteneh to become the first gold medallist of the event. She also won a silver medal in the 5000 m, finishing behind Genzebe Dibaba.
Taking to the senior circuit, she ran at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix in August and took second in the 3000 m behind Sylvia Kibet, setting a new lifetime best of 8:42.09. She turned her focus to senior cross country and won at the AK meet in Kericho in November, while her sister Caroline Chepkoech went on to win the junior race. She was chosen as the most promising sportswoman at Kenya's annual SOYA Awards. In January 2011 she ran at the Discovery Kenya Cross Country meet in Eldoret, but misjudged her run and slipped into fourth place near the end.
Cherono came thirteenth in the national senior cross country race in February 2011. Although she missed out on a place for the world team, she headed to the newly created 2011 African Cross Country Championships and won the gold in a medal sweep alongside Viola Kibiwot and Doris Changeywo. Her cross country season ended with a top three finish at the Trofeo Alasport. On the 2011 Diamond League circuit she placed in the top three of the 5000 m at the Prefontaine Classic and the Meeting Areva. She was chosen for the Kenyan senior track team for the first time and came fifth over 5000 m at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.
She began 2012 win with a sizeable win at the Campaccio cross country. She missed her chance to run at the 2012 Summer Olympics but was dominant on the track circuit that year: she won the Herculis, Athletissima and British Grand Prix 2012 IAAF Diamond League meets and was runner-up at the London Grand Prix, Weltklasse Zurich and Memorial van Damme. A 3000 m personal best of 8:38.51 minutes came at the Herculis meet. After the track season she won the Cross Internacional de Venta de Baños and the Cross de Itálica.
Cherono won the national trials for the 5000 m and went on to claim the silver medal in the event at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics behind Meseret Defar. On the 2013 IAAF Diamond League circuit she was runner-up in the 1500 m at the Memorial Van Damme, runner-up in the 3000 m at the DN Galan, and placed in the top three of the 5000&nsbp;m a both the Prefontaine Classic and the Weltklasse Zürich. She returned to the Cross de Venta de Baños and won for a consecutive season.
Personal.
Cherono is from Kipajit village, near Sotik town. She started running while at Kipajit Primary School and later moved to Chelimo Primary School near Kericho and eventually Ngariet Secondary School in Sotik. She is coached by Gabriel Kiptanui and managed by Gabriel Rosa. She is the oldest of six siblings. Her younger sister Sharon Chepkorir is also a runner. Their father John Koech runs a training camp in Kipajit village.

Locksley is a closed railway station on the North East railway that served the township of Locksley, Victoria, Australia. Opened on 18 October 1882 as "Burnt Creek Wood Siding", it was renamed "Burnt Creek" in 1883 and "Locksley" in 1904.
Initially a siding surrounded by sawmills, it was not opened to public goods traffic until 1883, with a passenger platform also added. In 1885 a signal box was provided, in 1887 a new passenger platform was erected, and a goods shed was built in 1890 located on down side. In 1898 the station building was destroyed by fire, with replacement built within a year. The station differed to others on the section of line, having the platform fronting onto the mainline, instead of being on a loop siding. In 1904 the mainline was modified to place it through number 2 road, which put the platform on a siding. The final layout was provided in 1916, with three roads and a goods siding. The station closed to passengers on 1 April 1973 and was closed to all traffic in 1977.

Many of them occupy important positions in orchestras and higher education as performers, teachers, conductors, and in allied professions. As a teacher, Andor Toth had very specific ideas about tone production, bow control, left hand finger placement and motion, vibrato, and all other facets of a well-developed artistic technique. His ability to use bow speed and weight with almost limitless variation to create phrasing and subtle tone variations was a hallmark of his own playing and his teaching. His musicianship was legendary. John Rockwell (in the New York Times review cited below) accurately described Toth as a "violinistic poet." Some of his many prominent students are listed here.
New York Times review.
On September 28, 1982, "New York Times" critic John Rockwell had this to say about Toth's last New York concert: "Mr. Toth's principal virtue is his ability to invest even the most brilliant of passages with thoughtfulness; every phrase sounded shaped and considered, with a rich, ample tone . . . And Mr. Toth is hardly one of those violinistic poets who wins one over despite an erratic technique; his intonation and articulation were secure in a way that was continually impressive yet never called undue attention to itself." [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DF1E38F93BA1575AC0A964948260]
Andor Toth died of a massive stroke in Los Angeles, California, November 28, 2006. He was 81 years old.

Teddy Tahu Rhodes

Teddy Tahu Rhodes (born 30 August 1966) is a New Zealand operatic baritone.
Early life.
Teddy Tahu Rhodes was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 30 August 1966, to a British mother and a New Zealand father. The Maori word "Tahu", which means "to set on fire", was added to the family name soon after they settled in New Zealand. His parents divorced when he was an infant, and he grew up with his mother. His aunt Margaret Rhodes, the wife of his paternal uncle, is a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.
In his final year of secondary school, Christ's College, Canterbury, Rhodes was selected for the New Zealand Youth Choir, where his musical potential was first identified. Following a relatively short period of formal lessons, he was entered into the 1986 Dame Sister Mary Leo Scholarship competition, which he won. He pursued private studies while studying at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, subsequently qualifying as an accountant. His teachers, at this time and later, included Mary Adams Taylor, Rudolf Piernay, and David Harper.
In 1991 Rhodes won the Mobil Song Quest, the major competition of its type in New Zealand, securing funding to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. He turned down an offer by the Guildhall of a scholarship for two years of further study, returning to New Zealand where he worked as an accountant for some years.
Career.
While working as an accountant in Christchurch, Rhodes maintained an association with Canterbury Opera, the local repertory opera company. In 1998 he made his international debut in an acclaimed performance of Dandini in "La Cenerentola" for Opera Australia, and was launched on an international career. Following his Australian debut, in 1999 Rhodes represented New Zealand in the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition.
He has sung in several world and Australian premiere performances such as "The End of the Affair" (Bendrix) and "Dead Man Walking" (Joe) by Jake Heggie, "The Little Prince" by Rachel Portman (The Pilot) as well as in Nigel Butterley’s "Spell of Creation" and Barry Conyngham’s "Fix". His wide variety of other opera roles have included Mozart's Count Almaviva, Guglielmo, Papageno and Don Giovanni; Demetrius in "A Midsummer Night's Dream"; Belcore in "L'elisir d'amore"; Billy in "Billy Budd"; Lescaut in "Manon Lescaut"; Stanley in "A Streetcar Named Desire"; Escamillo in "Carmen"; Al Kasim in Hans Werner Henze's "L'upupa"; Silvio in "Pagliacci", Harlequin in "Ariadne auf Naxos", Leandro in "The Love for Three Oranges" and Antony in Barber's "Antony and Cleopatra". In 2012/13, he performed opposite Lisa McCune in Opera Australia's production of the Bartlett Sher 2008 New York revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "South Pacific" at the Sydney Opera House, the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, and the Brisbane Queensland Performing Arts Centre. He will join McCune again in Opera Australia's production of "The King and I" in 2014 in Sydney and Brisbane.
Amongst the prominent opera companies and theatres in which he has performed are the Metropolitan Opera, Opera Australia, San Francisco Opera, Austin Lyric Opera, Washington National Opera, Opera Company of Philadelphia, Dallas Opera, Cincinnati Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Hamburg State Opera, Bavarian State Opera, Welsh National Opera, Scottish Opera, the Théâtre du Châtelet, the Santa Fe Opera, the New York City Opera and the Theater an der Wien.
Rhodes was again in the news in January 2010 when he substituted at three hours' notice for an indisposed Mariusz Kwiecień in the role of Escamillo in the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD telecast of "Carmen", a role he was to take over from Kwiecień later in the season.
In oratorio and choral works, he has appeared as the baritone soloist in performances of Handel's "Messiah" with the Melbourne Symphony and the Sydney Philharmonia Choirs, and in Fauré's "Requiem" with the London Philharmonic.
Awards.
Rhodes has been the recipient of several major awards. In 2004 he received an ARIA award for Best Classical Recording for his CD "The Voice", and in 2006 he was the winner of the Limelight Award for Best Performance by a Soloist with an Orchestra for his Australian tour with the Australian Chamber Orchestra. In 2008 he won a Helpmann Award for Best Male Performer in an Opera for his role in "Dead Man Walking". In 2008 he received a Laureate Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand.
Personal life.
Rhodes first married in 1989, a union that was dissolved amicably in 1996. He married mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard in December 2008. In September 2013, this marriage was reported to have ended.
Discography.
Teddy Tahu Rhodes' recordings include several recital discs on ABC Classics including "Mozart Arias" with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, "The Voice", a collection of arias and songs, and "Vagabond", a collection of songs and song cycles including Ralph Vaughan Williams' "Songs of Travel" with pianist Sharolyn Kimmorley.

Dr Sir Warrior

Christogonus Ezebuiro Obinna (1947, Imo State, Nigeria – June 2, 1999), the Ultimate Dr. Sir Warrior, was the leader of the Oriental Brothers International Band which was famous in the Nigerian highlife music scene for several decades. He performed primarily in Nigeria, as well as performing internationally in places such as London and the United States of America.
Musical career.
Dr. Sir Warrior was able to transform his performance into a successful career in the 1970s when he joined the Oriental Brothers International Band. The band later splintered, leading to Prince Ichita & the Great Oriental Brothers International Band, Oriental Brothers International, and then the original Dr. Sir Warrior & His Oriental Brothers International, simply called The Oriental Original. He had about 12 platinum and 10 gold hits in his career. His 1978 album "Nwanne Awu Enyi" went gold, selling more than 7.8 million copies.
The Oriental Brothers were composed primarily of Godwin Kabaaka Opara, Ferdinand Dansatch Emeka Opara, Nathaniel Ejiogu, Hybrilious Akwilla Alaraibe, Prince Ichita and Christogonus Ezebuiro "Warrior" Obinna. Ejiogu died shortly before the band's success. The first split within the group occurred in 1977 when founding members Dansatch Opara and Prince Ichita left to start their own bands under the Oriental Brothers moniker. The Opara brothers later joined The Oriental Original.
Though each of the groups had their distinct sound, they all shared a passion for blending Congolese guitar picking and traditional Igbo rhythms. According to the Igbo magazine Kwenu, “the Oriental Brothers played a very important spiritual role in keeping many Igbo sane. They were the pride of a people traumatized by a war so vicious.”
Musical style.
Combining Igbo vocals with deft guitar work and a solid rhythm section, Warrior created a unique style of music that for many people is the definitive sound of highlife music. Warrior was one of the most influential musicians to come out of Igboland. He started playing the guitar in the 1960s.He always had a sense of revolution, as he created a brand of highlife that is Igbo at the core, and at the same time universal in taste. He introduced the Oyorima concept, which is an Igbo word that means a refined feeling of rhythmic movement and balance.
Early life.
Dr. Sir Warrior was from Umuhu Enyiogugu in Aboh Mbaise local government area of Imo state Nigeria. His name, Obinna, means ""Father´s Heart"" (God's Mind). Dr Sir Warrior began performing at the age of 11, when joined a men's choral group specialising in a music form known as Èsè. By 16, he had achieved fame for his voice and performance of Èsè music.
Family.
Dr Sir Warrior was married and had five children (3Boys & 2girls). His first son had said of him "He did not allow us to get interested in music. He wanted us to finish our education first. He would always emphasize that education was the best legacy, other things could follow later". The younger Ajuzieogu knew that he would one day be a highlife musician like his dad. They both said, "As long as we intend to pursue music as career we will still abide with our father's wish". Quickly after Warrior's exit, fellow highlife artists knew it would be long before another person of his quality emerges. His legacy was summarized by Oliver De Coque, who in paying tribute to Dr. Sir Warrior, said, "He was a very good and amiable person. We have lost such a genius in highlife."

Treelodge@Punggol (Chinese: 绿馨苑) (previously known as Treetops@Punggol) is Singapore’s First Green Mark Platinum Award Public Housing Project. The Eco-Precinct was launched in March 2007 under the Build-To-Order (HDB) Scheme. Located in Punggol New Town, at the junction of Punggol Road, Punggol Drive and Punggol Place, Treelodge@Punggol is just a few minutes’ walk from the future Town Centre, Punggol MRT/LRT Station station and the Punggol Bus Interchange.
Building details.
Architecture.
Treelodge@Punggol consists of 712 units of Premium flats housed in seven 16-storey residential blocks. There are 98 units of 3-room flats, 600 units of 4-room flats and 14 units of 5-room loft units. Unique to this Eco-Precinct is the 5-room loft unit which features a double-volume living room and an open terrace that can be converted into a sky garden. Like the other housing projects in the BTO Scheme, Treelodge@Punggol was designed by Surbana. Kay Lim Construction & Trading Pte Ltd won the tender to build the project for $119.70 million on 24 December 2007. The estimated completion date for Treelodge@Punggol is 4th Quarter 2010.
The residential development incorporates a range of green technologies and innovations for effective energy, water and waste management. These include north-south orientation of the buildings, solar panels to generate lighting for common areas, centralised recyclable refuse chutes and a rainwater collection system. Intensified greenery at the eco-deck, vertical greening along the columns of the residential blocks, and green roofs at the roof decks helps to cool down the ambient temperature, while beautifying the precinct environment. In addition, there is a well-shaded jogging path for residents, exercise stations for the elderly and a children’s playground made from recycled materials.
FerroLite partition wall system.
Treelodge@Punggol was one of the piloted HDB projects in Singapore for the FerroLite partition wall system.
Designed to reduce noise transmission between rooms, the ﬂats come ﬁtted with the patented FerroLite partition wall system. The wall is essentially non-load bearing and made of ferrocement. As compared to other cement-based partition walls, the hollow core of the FerroLite wall cuts down on the need for raw materials like cement and sand. In addition, services can be installed and concealed within the wall with minimal wet works and without the need for hacking.

<doc id="18428215" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18428215" title="Madrigal (poetry)">
Madrigal (poetry)

Madrigal () is the name of a form of poetry, the exact nature of which has never been decided in English.
The definition given in the "New English Dictionary", "a short lyrical poem of amatory character," offers no distinctive formula; some madrigals are long, and many have nothing whatever to do with love. The most important English collection of madrigals, not set to music, was published by William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649) in his "Poems" of 1616. Perhaps the best way of ascertaining what was looked upon in the 17th century as a madrigal is to quote one of Drummond's:
The beauty and the life Of life's and beauty's fairest paragon, O tears! O grief! hung at a feeble thread, To which pale Atropos had set her knife; The soul with many a groan Had left each outward part, And now did take his last leave of the heart; Nought else did want, save death, even to be dead; When the afflicted band about her bed, Seeing so fair him come in lips, cheeks, eyes, Cried ah! and can death enter Paradise?
This may be taken as a type of Drummond's madrigals, of which he has left us about eighty. They are serious, brief, irregular lyrics, in which neither the amatory nor the complimentary tone is by any means obligatory. Some of these pieces contain as few as six lines, one as many as fourteen, but they average from nine to eleven. In the majority of examples the little poem opens with a line of six syllables, and no line extends beyond ten syllables. The madrigal appears to be a short "canzone" of the Tuscan type, but less rigidly constructed. In French the madrigal has not this Italian character. It is simply a short piece of verse, ingenious in its turn and of a gallant tendency. The idea of compliment is essential. J. F. Guichard (1730–1811) writes: ""Orgon, poke marital, A Venus compare sa femme; C'est pour la belle un madrigal, C'est pour Venus une epigramme.""
This quatrain emphasizes the fact that in French a madrigal is a trifling piece of erotic compliment, neatly turned but not seriously meant. The credit of inventing the old French verse form of madrigal belongs to Clément Marot, and one of his may be quoted in contrast to that of Drummond:
Un doux nenni avec un doux sourire Est tant honneste, it le vous faut apprendre; Quant est de oui, si veniez a le dire, D'avoir trop dit je voudrois vous reprendre; Non que je sois ennuye d'entreprendre D'avoir le fruit dont le desir me point; Mais je voudrois qu'en ne le laissant prendre, Vous me disiez: vous ne l'aurez point.
In English, when the word first occurred — it has not been traced farther back than 1588 (in the preface to Nicholas Yonge's "Musica transalpina") — it was identified with the chief form of secular vocal music in the 16th century. In 1741, John Immyns (1700–1764) founded the Madrigal Society, which met in an ale-house in Bride Lane, Fleet Street; this association still exists, and is the oldest musical society in Europe.
The word "madrigal" is frequently also used to designate a sentimental or trifling expression in a half-contemptuous sense.

<doc id="18428226" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18428226" title="Valspar">
Valspar

The Valspar Corporation is an international manufacturer of paint and coatings based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. With nearly 10,000 employees in 25 countries, it is the sixth largest paint and coating corporation in the world. The 200+ year old Valspar was founded in 1806 as a paint dealership in Boston, Massachusetts. The Valspar name emerged in 1903 as a new clear varnish, and became the company name in 1932. 
History.
19th century beginnings.
In 1806, Samuel Tuck established a paint dealership in Boston, Massachusetts, called "Paint and Color." Over the course of 50 years, the dealership changed owners and names several times, and was eventually acquired by Augustine Stimson. In 1832, Lawson Valentine had incorporated Valentine and Company as a varnish manufacturer in Boston. The two businesses eventually merged under the name Stimson & Valentine.
Later in 1855, Otis Merriam joined as a principal owner, and in 1860 Henry Valentine, Lawson Valentine's brother, joined the company. By 1866, both Stimson and Merriam were retired from the group and the company was renamed back to Valentine & Company and Lawson Valentine hired Charles Homer, brother of American artist Winslow Homer, as a chemist for the company. Homer, being one of few chemists in the United States at the time, was the first such specialist recruited into the American varnish industry.
In 1870, Valentine & Company relocated to New York City and acquired the Minnesota Linseed Oil Paint Company. Around this time, the company began to develop varnishes for use on vehicles which could compete with English-made varnishes. Henry Valentine succeeded his brother as president in 1882, taking over a company with operations in Boston, Chicago, New York City and on the West Coast of the United States. Later their operations expanded to Pennsylvania and Paris.
The Valspar name.
Valspar was the first ever clear varnish, and was developed by L. Valentine Pulsifer, Lawson Valentine's grandson. Pulsifer had joined the company in 1903 after earning a degree in chemistry from Harvard University. After three years of experimentation, he created the clear varnish, which went into production by 1905. The Valspar varnish was the company's main product for the next thirty-some years. The advertising tagline, "the varnish that won't turn white" made Valspar a household name. Famous uses of Valspar by Robert Peary in his 1909 expedition, the United States military in World War I, and Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight helped boost its fame.
In 1932, the Valspar Corporation was formed, with Valentine & Company retained as a subsidiary. In 1960, Valspar merged with Ralph Baudhuin's Rockcote, which gave them more manufacturing in the Midwestern United States and a new headquarters in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Under the leadership of Ralph and F. J. Baudhuin, Valspar averaged almost two acquisitions per year through the 1960s. In June 1970, Valspar merged with Minnesota Paints and relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and its former president, C. Angus Wurtele, became chairman of Valspar in 1973. The influx of cash from this latest acquisition boosted Valspar's acquisition power and by the end of the decade, their annual revenue had increased by $74 million.
Era of acquisitions.
Prior to the 1980s, Valspar's primary focus had been on consumer business, but in 1984 they acquired Mobil's coatings business for $100 million. This effectively doubled Valspar's business; their revenue was almost equal to Mobil's coatings division. Furthermore, as the division represented less than 0.5% of Mobil's total business at the time, they were willing to sell it off for a low price. Valspar completed integration of Mobil's operations by 1986.
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Valspar continued to acquire paint and coatings companies and continued growing. Enterprise Paint Companies in 1987, the McCloskey Corporation in 1989, and Hi-Tek Polymers and portions of Cook Paint and Varnish Company in 1991. In 1993, Valspar announced that it would acquire Cargill's resin products division, but the Federal Trade Commission tried to block it as Valspar would have too large a share of the resin market in the Midwestern United States. Valspar went ahead with the deal anyway, but divided the business between two companies McWhorter Technologies and Engineered Polymer Solutions.
Richard Rompala, formerly of PPG Industries, became president in 1994, CEO in 1995 and chairman in 1998. He pushed the then-primarily North American company into China, Hong Kong, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa and acquiring some companies. In 2000, Valspar acquired Lilly Industries, which required them to divest their mirror coatings business in order to conform with United States antitrust law. However, due to the cooling economy and restructuring charges from fourteen plant closings in 2001, Valspar's twenty-six consecutive years of earnings growth was halted.
Valspar bought Samuel Cabot Incorporated in 2005.
Brands.
The Valspar Corporation sells its products under a number of separate brand names, many of which have been acquired through a series of buyouts in the past 20 years.

Veier Head

Veier Head () is a high, snow-covered headland which marks the southernmost point of Jason Peninsula on the east coast of Graham Land. Norwegian explorer Captain C.A. Larsen discovered what he charted as an island in this vicinity on December 9, 1893. The feature was first seen by Soren Andersen First Mate of the Jason (ship), and was named "Veieroen" after his home, Veierland or Veieroen, in Norway. It is possible that Larsen mistook this high southern part of Jason Peninsula (which agrees well with his position and is conspicuous from seaward) for a separate island. In order to preserve Larsen's original name in the area, the name Veier Head has been approved for the headland described.

Boris Kovač

Boris Kovač (; born 1955) is a Serbian composer and multi-instrumentalist.
Biography.
Boris Kovač is a composer, instrumentalist and multimedia artist from the Vojvodina region, the northern part of Serbia. He composes music for chamber groups he rehearses and leads, moreover many of his projects are to some extent connected with theatre. During the period from 1991 until 1995 he lived and worked in Italy, Slovenia and Austria.
In 1996 Boris moved back to Serbia, where he led several new projects in which were involved his RITUAL NOVA ensemble, LaDaABa orchest, La Campanella orchestra, Chamber Theatre of Music OGLEDALO, Academy of Fine Skills.
He engaged himself also in the work with students, in order to re-establish the contemporary music/theatre scene in his country.
His ensembles performed more than 500 concerts in about 250 festivals of World/New/Jazz Music in around 30 countries, travelling through 4 continents.
His albums were 3 times in the Top 10 of the European Broadcast Union (World Music Charts Europe). In August 2005 the album “World after history” reached the second position; the album The Last Balkan Tango was chosen among the best "50 essential albums ever” by the popular Songlines magazine.
Boris Kovač got the biggest Serbian theatre prize -STERIJA AWARD for music in the year 2007 for the play “Nahod Simeon”.
In 2008 he received the prize for the best music from the Cinema City festival for the soundtrack of the movie “Na lepom plavom Dunavu – The Beautiful Blue Danube”.
His DVD “Before and after Apocalypse” received the prize of the German Critics Association.
In 2009 Boris composed the music for “White, white World”, a fiction film directed by Oleg Novković . This soundtrack got the award from Serbian film Centre (voted by the film critics), as the Best Soundtrack in Serbia for 2010, proving that Kovač is an excellent choice to compose music for film and theatre.
Music.
Kovač's music draws on folklore traditions – not only Serbian ones, but also Hungarian and Romanian, since they all factor in the musical culture of multi-ethnic Vojvodina. In his "Last Balkan Tango", he combines these traditions with the styles of Argentine tango. His musical output falls into three categories: the deeply spiritual cycles he writes for his ensemble Ritual Nova, the more formal contemporary chamber music for dance and theater, and the dance music of his LaDaABa Orchest.
"Our advantage is that people from 20 different nationalities live together in the Pannonian Plains. So today no one can say which folklore my music stems from exactly."

Danube Delta horse

Danube Delta horse refers to a population of feral horse found in and around Letea Forest, located in the Danube Delta, between the Sulina and Chilia branches of Danube. About 3600 feral horses live in the Danube Delta, 2000 in the Letea nature reserve, where on one hand, they are among the last remaining "wild" (feral) horses living at large on the European continent, but are also deemed to be a threat to the flora of the forest, including to some plants on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
Although feral horses have existed for hundreds of years in the region, their number greatly increased after the collective farms were closed down in 1990 and the horses belonging to them being freed. Today, the Letea population is not regulated and there are concerns that overgrazing is a looming problem. 
The horses on Letea are black or bay, without white spots. They stand between 14.1 and 14.3 hands ( ) and are of a strong build. They are of a different breed than the close by Sfântu Gheorghe breed. They are not of a riding horse build, but are built like working horses of the Nonius type.
In 2002, some of these horses were captured and transported to Italy and slaughtered. Some organizations objected to removal, holding that the horses had value in being adapted to the location and possessing natural social behavior. Another push for removal and slaughter began in 2009, but horses cannot be currently removed from the area because a number of animals carry equine infectious anemia. Therefore, according to Romanian regulation, they are not allowed to be taken out of the quarantine area. Currently, there is an ongoing project, in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature, seeking to find a way to remove these horses. While some organizations object to total removal and advocate for some animals to remain, others are attempting to find a different preserve for the horses to live.

Office of Science

The Office of Science is a component of the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The Office of Science is the lead federal agency supporting fundamental scientific research for energy and the Nation’s largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences. The Office of Science portfolio has two principal thrusts: direct support of scientific research and direct support of the development, construction, and operation of unique, open-access scientific user facilities that are made available for use by external researchers.
The Office of Science manages this research portfolio through six interdisciplinary scientific program offices: Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Basic Energy Sciences, Biological and Environmental Research, Fusion Energy Sciences, High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics. The Office of Science also has responsibility for 10 of the 17 United States Department of Energy National Laboratories.
The office is the predominant U.S. federal government sponsor for research in the physical sciences, including physics, chemistry, computer science, applied mathematics, materials science, nanoscience, and engineering, as well as systems biology and environmental sciences. The Office of Science makes extensive use of peer review and federal advisory committees to develop general directions for research investments, to identify priorities, and to determine the very best scientific proposals to support.
The 10 Office of Science national laboratories are: Ames Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.
Program offices.
The Office of Science includes six interdisciplinary science program offices:
Advanced Scientific Computing Research.
The Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) supports research and development in applied mathematics, computer science, and integrated network environments. The programs it supports represent the largest and most active computer science research effort within the U.S. federal government. Supercomputer facilities supported by ASCR include the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, and the Leadership Computing Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. The ASCR supports the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet), which interconnects more than 30 DOE sites at speeds up to 20 gigabits per second.
ESnet is a successor to a network that the Office of Science created in 1974 to connect geographically dispersed researchers through a single network. In the 1980s the Office of Science collaborated with DARPA, NSF and NASA to convert the agencies' separate networks into a single integrated communications network that became the basis for the commercial Internet.
Biological and Environmental Research.
The Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) supports research and scientific user facilities in the biological and environmental sciences to support DOE's missions in energy, environment, and basic research. BER initiated the Human Genome Project in 1986 and has continued to support activity in genomics-based systems biology and initiatives related to biotechnology applications. The Joint Genome Institute, formed in 1997, initially conducted sequencing of human DNA in support of the Human Genome Project. Its current focus is on sequencing the genomes of microbes, microbial communities, fungi, plants, and other organisms. 
Environmental efforts include research on the global carbon cycle and possible mitigation of the impacts of climate change. When it started in 1978, BER's Climate Change Research Program was the first U.S. research program to investigate the effects of greenhouse gases on climate and environment. The Office of Science climate change research program is now the third largest in the U.S.
Fusion Energy Sciences.
The Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) organization supports efforts to expand the fundamental understanding of plasma physics and the knowledge needed to develop a fusion energy source. This organization supports U.S. participation in the ITER project through the U.S. ITER Project Office, a partnership of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
Research funding.
More than 90 percent of the Office of Science budget is allocated to research and scientific facilities. The fundamental research areas in which the Office of Science has programs include physics and other basic energy sciences, biological and environmental sciences, and computational science. Support is provided for research activities in the national laboratories and universities. The office is the principal (or the single largest) source of U.S. federal government support for research in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, fusion energy, materials science, and chemical sciences. The Office of Science is estimated to provide 40 percent of the funding for basic research in the physical sciences in the United States. It is also a major source of funding for government-supported research in climate change, geophysics, genomics, life sciences, and science education.
In constant dollars, Office of Science annual budgets for Basic Energy Science and Advanced Scientific Computing nearly doubled between fiscal years 1996 and 2009. Budgets for High Energy Physics and Biological and Energy Research remained relatively constant through that 14-year period. Nuclear Physics and Fusion Energy Sciences budgets were relatively static through most of the period, but had substantial increases in fiscal 2009. The increase in the Fusion budget reinstated the U.S. contribution to ITER, which was reduced significantly in the previous year.
History.
DOE's Office of Energy Research was a predecessor to the Office of Science.
In 2006, the Office of Science was placed under the oversight of the Under Secretary of Energy for Science, a new position created by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
Accomplishments and awards.
DOE lists 76 Nobel Prize winners as having been associated with Office of Science programs or facilities under DOE and its predecessor agencies.

<doc id="18428315" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18428315" title="Amanita echinocephala">
Amanita echinocephala

Amanita echinocephala is a large, whitish or ivory-coloured mushroom with a characteristic spiny, or warty-looking cap. It lives on chalky soils with beech trees, and appears earlier than most mushrooms of similar size in southern England. It frequently occurs singly or in small groups, resulting in it being referred to as The Solitary Amanita or, more specifically, European Solitary Lepidella. It is very drought-tolerant. "Amanita solitaria" is a synonym and opinions are divided as to which name takes precedence.
Taxonomy.
It was first described as "Agaricus echinocephalus" in 1835 by the Italian mycologist Carlo Vittadini, before being placed in "Amanita" by Lucien Quélet and hence receiving its current binomial name. It derives its specific epithet "echinocephala" from the Greek "echino-" "hedgehog" and "kephale" "head". It has been placed in the "Lepidella" section of the Amanitaceae by some authors, because of its lack of a well formed volva. "Amanita solitaria" (Bull.:Fr.) Fr. is considered a synonym here but according to many modern authors (subject specialists in "Amanita", e.g., C. Bas or R.E. Tulloss) it is a valid name for this species.
Description.
The cap can be up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and is white to ivory, or silver-grey in colour. It is covered in raised pyramidal warts, that become less well defined, and less frequent towards the margin. These are remnants of the universal veil which covers the mushroom in its earliest stages. The young buttons are darker, and sometimes shaped like a two tier loaf, with a ring of raised scales around the base. The white to ivory stipe is 8–16 cm (3–6 in) high and 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) wide, with several rings of upturned scales towards the bulbous base. It is fairly deeply rooted, often laterally below the surface. The ring is thin and fragile, often adhering to the stipe. The gills are cream, but sometimes have a slight green tint. 
They are largely free of the stipe, but sometimes have a small decurrent tooth. The flesh is white, and is said to have an unpleasant smell.
Similar species.
Because the two species often share the same growing ground, "A. echinocephala", and "A. strobiliformis" have both been erroneously identified as "Amanita solitaria" in the past.
Distribution and habitat.
"Amanita echinocephala" occurs in Britain, Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. It appears in Britain during summer, and early autumn. It grows in light, dry calcareous soils with both broad leaved, (usually beech Fagus) and coniferous trees. It is quite drought-tolerant, giving rise to the suspicion that Southern England could be at the northern extent of its range. It occurs with hardwoods on calcareous soils, often associated with Limes ("Tilia") in the Czech Republic, sometimes together with "A. strobiliformis".
Edibility.
Pronounced edible by some, but probably best avoided in case of confusion with other poisonous "Amanita" species. This mushroom is rare and protected. It is on the United Kingdom Red Data List. Newly, it was reported that this species hyperaccumulates silver.

Chien Français Tricolore

The Chien français tricolore (FCI No.219) translated into English as the French Tricolour Hound, is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, originating in France. The breed is used for hunting in packs.
Appearance.
The breed is a typical large French hunting pack hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, elongated head with a noticeable occipital protuberance, long drop ears, and slightly square flews. Size is 62 cm to a maxium size of 72 cm (23.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females slightly smaller.
The coat is tricolour, with a wide black mantle, and tan parts are of a bright colour. A grizzled colour called "louvard" ("wolf-like") is also seen in the breed. Faults are listed as physical or behavioural abnormalities, and a dog with such faults should not be bred. Faults include fat feet, aggression, or any trace of crossing with English hounds.
History and use.
The Chien français tricolore are pack hunting dogs, which means that groups of dogs are hunted together, always directed by a human, not running about hunting by themselves. Dogs bred to be pack hunting dogs do not usually make good pets.

Guffy Roberts

Guffy Roberts (born Guffy David Roberts, August 23, 1965) is an American radio personality, singer, songwriter, and keytarist.
In March 1977, Roberts and fellow synth-player Trevor Science formed the band German Police Car, holding auditions for two remaining keyboardist positions in the gymnasium of Miami Killian High School. These auditions turned out to be fruitless, however, and they ultimately were forced to let Roberts' former girlfriend Olga Kraskavenovich in the band due to an upcoming performance at a Little Havana nightclub. There, the three bandmates found their fourth and final member, keyboardist Jamal Jenkins. The band was renamed "Trevor and Roberts" for a brief period in early 1978 but was ultimately renamed "German Police Car" due to wishes of the remaining band members.
After early success with 1978 radio single German Police Car from the album of the same year and name, German Police Car, the band toured across Europe for two years before being dissolved due to differences between Roberts and the rest of the band.
Guffy Roberts released five solo albums (two more than German Police Car released) before the age of 22, when he broke his contract directing instructional videos for Wendy's to become a disc jockey at Missouri State University's student radio station The Growl in Springfield, Missouri.
New Coke.
Roberts is best known for his eccentric ramblings and bipolar personality on his own radio programme New Coke from 1987 to 1989 with brief sporadic comebacks in the following years. The show's format consisted of an introduction by Roberts (during which he was prone to introduce and identify himself several times) followed by blocks of music and talking. Roberts' preferred style of music to play was new wave, what he often referred to as "underground pop music," but he would occasionally, reluctantly, take song requests from listeners who called into the show. Roberts was also known to play many songs by The Fat Boys, sometimes several in a row, as well as sporadic electronica, house, mutant disco, and new jack swing tracks.
Each show originally aired on Saturday nights and lasted roughly three hours, but after Roberts complained to a station manager about the length of his slot the show was shortened to two hours. Eventually the show was moved to weeknights after an additional complaint from Roberts about "not being able to party." This resulted in an infamous move in which Guffy Roberts physically assaulted an innocent bystander, accusing him of not knowing how to party.
Mental Instability.
Guffy Roberts' obsession with time travel was apparent to anyone who listened to his show, particularly during the 1989 season. He frequently claimed to have travelled into the 21st century to acquire "exclusive" tracks.
During several episodes, he vividly described hallucinations live on the air, possibly due to ingesting illegal drugs.
In an early episode, where Roberts was supposedly alone at the radio station, he talked to and may have even provided the voice of an imaginary gentleman named "Rupert" who spoke with a British accent.
Celebrity Interviews.
