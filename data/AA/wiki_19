Genome (novel)

Genome (, Genom) is a science fiction/detective novel by the popular Russian sci-fi writer Sergei Lukyanenko. The novel began a series also called "Genome", consisting of "Dances on the Snow" (a prequel, although written later) and "Cripples" (a sequel). The novel explores the problems of the widespread use of human genetic engineering, which alters not only human physiology but also psychology.
The Universe.
The novel takes place in the latter half of the 22nd century. Humans have left their cradle, colonized numerous extrasolar planets, and made contact with extraterrestrials, or "aliens", as most humans call them, even though such term is not considered to be politically correct. All humans are subjects of the Empire, ruled by a small child, although all decisions are made by the Imperial Council in his name. After the end of the conflicts between the Empire and the aliens several decades prior, the galaxy is, mostly, at peace, although relations are still tense between many of the species. To maintain the peace, the Empire was forced to quarantine its own colony of Ebon, which contained a large part of the Imperial military industry and provided a sizable percentage of soldiers. The ideology of the people of Ebon, formed by the ruling Church of the Angered Christ, demands the complete extermination of all alien life in the Universe to make way for the true children of God — humans. The fleet of Ebon was annihilated, and the planet itself was placed under a quarantine shield. Any Ebonite found outside the shield was forced to undergo deep psychotherapy.
Specs and clones.
Humanity continues the eugenic practice started long ago (in this regard, the novel is reminiscent of Lukyanenko's short story "The Road to Wellesberg"). Even as far back as the 21st century, methods were developed allowing the alteration of a human's genotype to adapt him or her to a particular position. Such operation (or "specification") is performed on a just-conceived fetus at the request of the parents, who, by doing this, forever decide the future of their child. Specified humans are called "specs", while non-modified humans are labeled "naturals". The cost of specification, the possibility of getting a credit for the procedure, and other conditions depend on the planet's demand in the requested profession. Specs are genetically compatible with naturals, as the former retain their non-modified genotype, and specified genes are only passed on if both parents possess them; however, the latter case still remains a choice on the parents' part. This allows the retention of specification without the help of geneticists (but only if the specs wish for their children to have the same specification) but also allows the return to the original genotype in just one generation.
Even during early childhood, a future spec develops brilliant abilities and a great interest in his or her future profession. The metamorphosis occurs around puberty, which involves the restructuring of the body and mind to match the specification. This takes place within several hours, usually under the watchful eye of a doctor. During this time, the person is completely helpless and does not perceive his or her surroundings. First, the body restructures itself, then the same thing happens to the psyche and the intellect, the latter being the most difficult and dangerous part of the metamorphosis. The spec's genetically-imprinted knowledge is activated; the visions experienced differ depending on the particular specification. For example, a master-pilot sees him- or herself flying through space, feeling completely happy. The undesirable abilities are suppressed. For example, pilots, detectives, and tax inspectors lose their ability to love, so that extraneous emotions do not interfere with their duties.
After the metamorphosis, no matter the actual age, the spec attains the full legal status of an adult and a rightful citizen of the Empire. However, not all knowledge is preprogrammed into the specs, and they are still required to attend schools and academies. Legally, a spec has a right to remove any genetic alteration, if he or she is unhappy with his or her current position. However, practically, this is unrealistic — first of all, not all changes are reversible, and second, as part of the metamorphosis, the spec is conditioned to completely love his or her job.
After completing training, a spec spends the rest of his or her life doing his or her favorite job, loving it and understanding that the job is done well. Every spec possesses immunity from most known diseases. They are highly paid and possess a higher social status than naturals, as well as higher respect among the fellow specs. It is said that "specs are happy from the cradle to the grave". A spec can only become unhappy if he or she is not allowed to perform his or her job or is incapable of performing it, although the latter is usually due to external reasons.
Most naturals do not have as high a salary as the specs and are usually forced to take on jobs that do not require special skills (valets, waiters, etc.). On the other hand, true creative jobs cannot be specified. There are no writers-spec or scientists-spec. Attempts at creating businessmen-spec and politicians-spec have also been largely unsuccessful. All of these professions belong to the naturals. Extraordinary naturals have been known to perform certain jobs on par with specs, although these cases are rare. The exceptions include jobs which a natural is physiologically unable to perform, such as an energetic-spec, who works directly with reactors and must be able to handle lethal doses of radiation. Also, almost no natural is completely unmodified, as several more general modifications are used by virtually everyone, including visual correction to fix bad eyesight and neural shunts allowing direct brain-to-computer interface.
Besides specs and naturals, there is also a third group of people: they are genetically-modified but lack any moral restrictions programmed into specs.
The need for colonization of new worlds led to underpopulation, which was partially compensated by mass cloning. Many clones currently live in the Empire, having the same legal rights as normal humans but are traditionally named after their prototype with "C-number" as a middle name (e.g. Andrey C-third Sidorov is the third clone of a man named Andrey Sidorov). All attempts to clone geniuses failed, as their clones have been unable to do any of the things their prototypes did. However, best specs are actively cloned.
Xenophobia is still present in human society: most specs see themselves as the naturals' betters, while the naturals tend not to like specs; also, many normal humans have misgivings about clones; and, of course, there is the distrust and dislike most humans feel for aliens.
Plot.
Alex Romanov is a pilot-spec, born on Earth, gets out of the hospital on the planet Mercury Bottom, where he spent six months after an accident. Alex meets Kim Ohara, a runaway fourteen-year-old girl, who is an unformed fighter-spec, escaped from her home on Eden. He invites the hungry girl to dine, but, during dinner, her metamorphosis kick in. Unfortunately, the process must take place in a hospital under the watchful eyes of qualified doctors, but Alex is out of money and does not know anyone on this planet. As a pilot-spec, Alex is psychologically incapable of not helping someone in his charge. He takes her to a cheap hotel (the Hilton) and tries to help her through the transformation. For this he needs medicine, but he has spent everything he had left on the hotel room. He uses the network terminal in the hotel to search for work. He surprisingly quickly locates a perfect and extremely attractive offer — the post of captain on a small but new ship "Mirror" with the right to choose his own crew. While Alex is skeptical that this is just too good to be true, he has no choice but to sign the contract. He gets his advance and uses the money to help Kim.
During the metamorphosis, Kim reveals that she has a secret compartment in her body, containing a fairly large gel-crystal — one that is usually used in a supercomputer. The crystal costs a fortune, and the fact that a poor, hungry girl is carrying it around makes no sense at all. With Alex's help, Kim successfully goes through the metamorphosis overnight and is completely fine in the morning. She refuses to talk about herself or of how she got to the planet. She only confirms that she does not know anyone on the planet and has no job or identification.
Taking command of his ship, Alex begins the process of hiring his new crew. He hires a Black-race doctor named Janet Ruelo from the quarantined planet Ebon, a spec with five specifications. Other crewmembers include a nineteen-year-old energetic-spec Paul Lurie and a navigator-natural Pak Generalov. Later, he hires a co-pilot, a spec named Hang Morrison. Instead of looking for a fighter-spec (the crew requirements are very specific in the contract), he decides to give Kim a try. However, this is problematic, given that she has no ID. In order to obtain one without contacting Eden, he has to bend the rules: Alex and Kim get temporarily married, Kim takes Alex's last name as her own, and gets a new ID as Kim Romanova.
With his crew ready, Alex is ordered by the owner of the ship to take on several passengers and do whatever they ask. The passengers turn out to be two Czygu tourists, Zei-so and Sei-so, as well their guide-spec Danila C-third Shustov, an employee of the Sky Company, who are also the owners of the "Mirror". Apparently, as Alex finds out, their job is to transport alien tourists to see Imperial planets. Unfortunately, the situation is not very pleasant. One of Janet Ruelo's specifications is as an executioner-spec, meaning she specialized in killing aliens and utterly hates them. Kim becomes hysterical, after finding out that one of their stops is the planet Eden, as she is afraid to return to her homeworld. Alex finds out that Pak Generalov pathologically hates clones and has a hard time accepting C-third on their ship. Alex has to convince Kim, demand Janet to give him a warrior's oath not to harm the Czygu, and reason with Generalov. There is another problem, however. After a genetic test, Alex finds out that Kim is not only a fighter-spec, but also a hetaera-spec. The latter specification demands the love of her object of desire, who turns out to be Alex. But Alex, being a pilot-spec, is physically incapable of loving Kim. And Kim physically cannot stop loving Alex until he returns her feelings.
The tour almost immediately results in a disaster. While entering the hyperchannel, another ship nearly collides with the "Mirror" which would have forced the ship to end up in Brauni space. Alex's Czygu passengers would have almost certainly been taken prisoner. Fortunately, with Janet's quick thinking, they were able to avoid the collision.
During the flight, Kim reveals to Alex the secret of her gel-crystal. Apparently, the crystal contains an encoded personality of a friend of Kim's, an adolescent boy named Edgar. Edgar explained to Kim that his personality was artificially created to become a unique spec — a genetic constructor, a spec creator. Growing up within the crystal's virtual world, Edgar managed to gain access to the public network, meeting Kim. He then programmed his lab's robot to give the crystal to Kim and destroy the lab, so that everyone thinks that Edgar's crystal perished with it. Kim have long protected Edgar's secret, carrying his crystal inside her body. Unfortunately, her mother accidentally discovered the crystal and called the police. Kim and Edgar were forced to flee. Alex, connecting the crystal to his personal computer, enters Edgar's virtual world and meets the boy. While Edgar confirms Kim's story, Alex sees certain inconsistencies in his virtual surroundings and the boy's behavior.
Alex asks Edgar for a favor — to create a substance which would temporarily disable a spec's emotional modifications. Alex wants to give this substance to Kim to "cure" her of her love for him. While no one believes that such a thing is possible, Alex finds out that Edgar is truly a genius. He gives Alex a formula to synthesize the blocker, and Alex orders it from a pharmaceutical lab on the planet New Ukraine. However, before risking giving an untested substance to Kim, Alex takes a few drops of it himself. The effect is nearly immediate — Alex loses the pleasurable feeling every pilot-spec gets during the neural connection with the ship. Also, he understands that this feeling, like the usual pleasures of sex — are simply shadows of the true feeling which he has been denied. Still not understanding what it means to love, Alex begins to feel sorrow and the feeling of enormous loss.
Before landing on the planet Zodiac, the crew finds out that a crime has taken place on board the ship — Zei-so has been brutally murdered. The ship remains in orbit and receives two visitors: a detective-spec named Peter C-forty-fourth Valk, preferring the name Sherlock Holmes, and his assistant, a natural forensics expert Jenny Watson. While the crime itself is horrendous, the consequences are even more so. Apparently, Zei-so was an heiress to the Czygu throne. As such, the Czygu are preparing for an all-out war with the Empire. Since the forces are about even, the war is bound to devastate both species, and the victor will be too weak to stand against the other races, who will not miss their chance to gain extra territory. This has already happened to the once-mighty Taii, who are now a dying race. The Empire, faced with such prospects, will be forced to lift the quarantine of Ebon. The military power of Ebon is so great, that the Czygu will have no chance, but the other races will forget their differences and united against humanity. There is only one way of preventing the war — find the murderer within two days and show the Czygu undeniable proof that justice has been served. If Sei-so personally executes the killer, the war will be averted. Unfortunately, the murder was committed by a professional — no trace has been left in Zei-so's quarters. Also, every crew member had the opportunity and the motive to perform the deed.
After further conversing with Edgar, Alex realizes who he really is. He is not an adolescent consciousness artificially grown in a gel-crystal. In fact, it is the consciousness of a long-dead legendary genetic constructor named Edward Garlitsky, who is credited with founding the science of specification. Garlitsky wanted to create a superhuman, who would unite all the enhancements from all specs. Unfortunately, his work was not only deemed unneeded, it was seen as dangerous. Garlitsky was fired and, at the Emperor's decree, his consciousness was copied onto a gel-crystal and his body destroyed, so he could continue working on specifications but under a watchful eye of the overseers. Unable to find another way out, Garlitsky saw his chance when he was requested to create a new secret agent specification. He made certain unnoticed alterations to the specification, like a hidden pouch in the stomach. This child turned out to be Kim Ohara. Garlitsky made contact with her, falsifying his identity, and convinced her to help him escape. His goal is to become a physical human again.
When Alex claims he knows the identity of the killer, the detective-spec allows him to do whatever is necessary to reveal him or her. Using Edgar's blocker, Alex reveals the killer — an undercover agent-spec, pretending to be a member of the crew. The killer is apprehended and executed, although Sei-so is critically wounded in the process. Unfortunately, further investigation turns out to be fruitless, as everything points to people too powerful to accuse. The Sky Company is bankrupted, and the crew of the "Mirror" is fired. The body of the executed person is bought out by Kim, who plans to give it Edward "Edgar" Garlitsky. Alex begins to understand that the effect of Edgar's substance is not temporary, which means that he will retain the ability to love for a long time, possibly forever.

Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis

Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) is the major instrument on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS). MIRAS employs a planar antenna composed of a central body (the so-called hub) and three telescoping, deployable arms, in total 69 receivers on the Unit. Each receiver is composed of one LICEF module, which detects radiation in the microwave L-band, both in horizontal and vertical polarizations. The aperture on the LICEF detectors, planar in arrangement on MIRAS, point directly toward the Earth's surface as the satellite orbits. The arrangement and orientation of MIRAS makes the instrument a 2-D interferometric radiometer that generates brightness temperature images, from which both geophysical variables are computed. The salinity measurement requires demanding performance of the instrument in terms of calibration and stability. The MIRAS instrument's prime contractor was EADS CASA Espacio, manufacturing the payload of SMOS under ESA's contract.
LICEF.
The LICEF detector is composed of a round patch antenna element, with 2 pairs of probes for orthogonal linear polarisations, feeding two receiver channels in a compact lightweight package behind the antenna. It picks up thermal radiation emitted by the Earth near 1.4 GHz in the microwave L-band, amplifies it 100 dB, and digitises it with 1-bit quantisation.

Mike Morrison (baseball)

Michael Morrison (February 6, 1867 – June 16, 1955) was a right-handed professional baseball pitcher who played from 1887 to 1888 and in 1890 for the Cleveland Spiders, Syracuse Stars and Baltimore Orioles. 
Not much is known about Morrison's career prior to the major leagues. He played for a team known as the Erie Jarecki Manufacturing nine in 1884 and in 1885, he played with a team known as the Erie Olympics.
Morrison was purchased from the New York Metropolitans for $500 in January, 1887, and he played in his first big league game on April 19, 1887. That season he went 12-25 with a 4.92 ERA in 316 innings. In 40 games started, he had 35 complete games, 205 walks and 158 strikeouts. He led the league in home runs allowed (13) and walks allowed, he finished second in strikeouts per nine innings (4.49), fourth in hit batsmen (22), sixth in strikeouts and losses, and eighth in earned runs allowed. His 22 hit batsmen are tied for ninth most all time among rookie pitchers.
He appeared in only four games in 1888, going 1-3 with a 5.40 ERA. 
In 1890, Morrison split time with two teams, the Stars and Orioles. He went 7-11 with a 5.53 ERA that season, making 21 appearances (18 starts) and completing 16 games. His 21 wild pitches were seventh in the league and his three games finished were ninth. His 4.82 strikeouts per nine innings were also ninth in the league. 
He played his final big league game on September 21, 1890.
Overall, Morrison went 20-39 with a 5.14 ERA in 65 career games (62 starts). He had 55 complete games, 325 walks and 254 strikeouts in 504 innings. As a hitter, he hit .213 in 287 career at-bats.
Following his death, Morrison was buried in Trinity Cemetery in Erie.

OR&amp;N 197

Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. 197 is a 4-6-2 Pacific type steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1905 for the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (OR&N). It has been owned by the City of Portland since 1958, and since mid-2012 it resides at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center, where it can be viewed by the public.
History.
OR&N 197 was built in 1905 for pulling passenger trains on E.H. Harriman's Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, a subsidiary to the Union Pacific Railroad in Oregon. It arrived from the builders just in time to celebrate the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. It continued to serve for Portland, Oregon, when in 1923, it was given heavy modifications, a new vanderbilt-type tender, and renumbered 3203; at that time it was owned by Union Pacific. The Union Pacific used the locomotive until its retirement sometime in the 1950s, when UP donated the locomotive to the City of Portland, Oregon. It was placed on display near Oaks Amusement Park, where it was soon joined by the larger and more powerful 4-8-4 type locomotives Southern Pacific 4449 and Spokane, Portland and Seattle 700.
Restoration.
In 1975, the SP 4449 was pulled out of the park to be restored to pull the American Freedom Train which would travel across the country during the United States Bicentennial. In 1990, SP&S 700 left the park to begin a restoration of its own, leaving the 197 the last engine in the park. Due to a parking lot expansion, the 197 was moved a short distance from its original 1950s resting place at Oaks Park. Otherwise, it sat almost forgotten until late 1995, when a small group of individuals banded together to consider returning the locomotive to operation. 
It took several months of negotiations and several more months of mechanical work to prepare the engine for movement, but by early February 1996 the 197 was almost ready to move for the first time in nearly 40 years. On February 10, 1996, it was finally removed from Oaks Park. It was then moved to the Brooklyn Roundhouse, where it once again joined SP 4449 and SP&S 700 to begin restoration. That day just happened to coincide with the height of severe flooding in the Portland area after a series of winter storms. The Willamette River was lapping at the embankment where the engine sat. The East Portland Traction Co. (now Oregon Pacific Railroad), owner of the nearby railroad right-of-way, had to clear several mudslides the preceding day, but the engine was moved without incident. The 197 was taken to the Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific) Brooklyn Roundhouse in southeast Portland, where it once again sat alongside the SP 4449 and SP&S 700.
As of 2008, the restoration was about half complete and was expected to be completed by 2012. It is being carried out by the all-volunteer "Friends of the OR&N 197".
Disposition.
Until 2012, OR&N 197 and Portland's other two steam locomotives were stored in the last remaining roundhouse in Portland, which was located in an active Union Pacific freight yard, the Brooklyn yard. After UP announced plans to close the Brooklyn Roundhouse, in order to expand the freight yard to facilitate increasing intermodal traffic, the non-profit Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation was formed to develop plans, and raise funds, to build a permanent home and restoration facility for Portland's three steam locomotives. Construction of the Oregon Rail Heritage Center (ORHC) began in October 2011, and the three steam locomotives moved to the new site on June 26, 2012. The ORHC opened to the public in September 2012.

Spin painting.
At the end of the 1960s she was one of the first artist to use centrifugal force to produce large-sized artworks. Inspired by children's games : spin art, spin painting, her goal was to transcend this modest use to get the most spectacular effects from it. 
Damien Hirst got the same idea in the 1990s, as her he transcends the original practice, by the use of more spectacular materials, sizes, shapes, and skill improvement.
Gallery.
After winning the ORTF prize in 1971 and the Art Society Medal for Science and Literature, Gendron opened the Annick Gendron Gallery in the 5th arrondissement of Parisin 1973. During a period of 10 years, Gendron exhibited with artists and friends such as Philippe Derome, Eugène de Kermadec, Chu-Teh-Chun, Albert Feraud, Ladislas Kijno and 1940s artists and designer as Chana Orloff, Paul Dupré-Lafon, Jean Dunand, André Arbus.

Cellach mac Fáelchair

Cellach mac Fáelchair (died 735) or Cellach Raigni was a King of Osraige in modern County Kilkenny. He was the son of Fáelchar Ua Máele Ódrain (died 693), a previous king.
The dynasty that ruled over Osraige in the early Christian period was known as the Dál Birn. His year of accession is unknown, the last king of Osraige to be mentioned in the annals prior to Cellach was Cú Cherca mac Fáeláin (died 712), however the "Book of Leinster" king lists name two other kings between Cú Cherca and Cellach.
At this time Osraige was part of the Kingdom of Munster and in the 8th century was often involved in conflicts with the men of Leinster, the Laigin. Cellach's father had been slain fighting versus Leinster. In 735 the men of Munster led by their king, Cathal mac Finguine (died 742) fought the Battle of Belach Éile with the men of Leinster. Many Munstermen were slain and among them was Cellach. The location of the battle makes it probable that Cellach of the Osraige was the aggressor and was taking advantage of the rivalry of the Uí Dúnlainge and the Uí Cheinnselaig branches of the Laigin at this time.
His son Dúngal mac Cellaig (died 772) was also King of Osraige but the kingship became dominated by a different line.

Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center

Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center is a 617-bed acute care hospital located on Woodland Street in Hartford, Connecticut. The hospital was established in 1897 by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambéry. With 617 beds and 65 bassinets, it is the largest Catholic hospital in New England.
Saint Francis has been affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital since 1990. This was the first recorded instance of collaboration between a Catholic hospital and a Jewish hospital in United States. The two institutions formalized the corporate merger in 1995. In addition, the hospital maintains affiliations with Bristol Hospital and Saint Mary's Hospital, Waterbury, which are independently licensed. Saint Francis, a regional referral center, has major clinical concentrations in cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, women's services and rehabilitation.
In 2008, they broke ground on the ten story addition, the John T. O'Connell Tower. Opened in March 2011, this addition included 19 replacement operating rooms, 72 replacement medical/surgical patient beds, and a Helipad on the roof of the building. It includes six orthopedic operating rooms and sixty-three replacement inpatient orthopedic beds for the Connecticut Joint Replacement Institute. Also featuring an enlarged emergency department, expanding the treatment area from forty-nine to sixty-eight treatment bays and increasing space for ambulances from six to ten parking spots. 
In January 2012, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center received its second PureCell System's Model 400 phosphoric acid fuel cell, which will provide power to the Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital campus. The 400 kW PureCell System will provide nearly half of the building’s electrical needs as well as providing thermal energy; the installation prevents the release of more than 383 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually – the equivalent of planting more than 88 acres of trees, the hospital claims.

The Cook County Sheriff's Office is the principal law enforcement agency that serves Cook County, Illinois. It is the second largest sheriff's department in the United States, with over 6,900 members when at full operational strength. It is headed by the Sheriff of Cook County, currently Thomas Dart. Due to its size the Cook County Sheriff's Office divides its operations by task into several departments, the most recognizable of which are the Court Services Division, Sheriff's Police Patrol Division, and the Department of Corrections.
All Cook County Sheriff's deputies have police powers regardless of their particular job function or title. Like other sheriffs' departments in Illinois, the sheriff can provide all traditional law-enforcement functions, including county-wide patrol and investigations irrespective of municipal boundaries, even in the city of Chicago, but has traditionally limited its police patrol functions to unincorporated areas of the county which are the primary jurisdiction of a sheriff's department in Illinois.
Sheriff's deputies outside of the patrol and investigations divisions provide the other services of the sheriff, such as service of process, fugitive apprehension, enforcing evictions and levies, securing courthouses, securing and operating the 9,000-plus detainee population of the Cook County Jail, transporting prisoners and overseeing offender rehabilitation programs.
Cook County has additional police departments that are not the responsibility of the sheriff. These include the Cook County Forest Preserve District Police and Cook County Hospital Police.
Sheriff's Office divisions.
The Cook County Sheriff's Office is carved into several divisions.
Rank structure and insignia.
Rank insignia for exempt positions that are above the exempt positions of commander and assistant chief include gold oak leaves and increasing numbers of gold stars worn on shirt collars and on shoulders of jackets.

Rank insignia for lieutenants are gold bars worn on the collars of the shirt and the shoulders of the jacket. 
Rank insignia for sergeants are gold chevrons worn on the collars of the shirt and embroidered chevrons worn on the upper sleeves of shirts and jackets. Tenured officers will have gold hash-marks or stars on the lower left side of their long-sleeved shirts and jackets. Each mark represents five years of service.

<doc id="18302693" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18302693" title="Zend">
Zend

The Zend or Zand (literally "interpretation"), refers to late middle Persian (see Pazend and Pahlavi) language commentaries on the individual books of the Avesta within Zoroastrianism. They date from the 3rd to 10th centuries and were not intended for use as theological texts by themselves but for religious instruction of the (by then) non-Avestan-speaking public. In contrast, the texts of the Avesta proper remained sacrosanct and continued to be recited in the Avestan language, which was considered a sacred language.
Manuscripts of the Avesta exist in two forms. One is the "Avesta-o-Zand" (or "Zand-i-Avesta"), in which the individual books are written together with their "Zand". The other is the "Vendidad Sadeh", in which the Yasna, Vispered and Vendidad are set out in alternating chapters, in the order used in the "Vendidad" ceremony, with no commentary at all.
The use of the expression "Zend-Avesta" to refer to the Avesta in general is a misunderstanding of the phrase "Zand-i-Avesta" (which literally means "interpretation "of" the Avesta").
A related mistake is the use of "Zend" as the name of a language or script. In 1759, Anquetil-Duperron reported having been told that "Zend" was the name of the language of the more ancient writings. In his third discourse, published in 1798, Sir William Jones mentions a conversation with a Hindu priest who told him that the script was called "Zend", and the language "Avesta". This mistake results from a misunderstanding of the term "pazend", which actually refers to the use of the Avestan alphabet in writing the "Zand" and other Middle Persian religious texts, as an expression meaning "in Zend".
The confusion then became too universal in Western scholarship to be easily reversed, and "Zend-Avesta", although a misnomer, is still occasionally used to denote the older texts.
Rasmus Rask's seminal work, "A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language" (Bombay, 1821), may have contributed to the confusion. N. L. Westergaard's "Zendavesta, or the religious books of the Zoroastrians" (Copenhagen, 1852–54) only propagated the error.

Turn on, tune in, drop out

"Turn on, tune in, drop out" is a counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary in 1966. In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and uttered the famous phrase, "Turn on, tune in, drop out". It was also the title of his spoken word album "Turn on, tune in, drop out" recorded in 1966 in New York by David Hancock and released that same year by ESP Disk' (156 5th Avenue, New York 10010) as ESP 1027. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice, obviously under the influence of LSD, on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, "the meaning of inner life", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues. This hypnotizing, colorful narrative suggests a form of sophrology. It should not be mistaken with another and better-known album of the same name released by Mercury Records in 1967, which included some rock music as well as more, shorter indoor speech: 
In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'". The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics and by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery. The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.
In his speech, Leary stated:
Leary later explained in his 1983 autobiography "Flashbacks":
"Turn on, tune in, drop out" is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology and psychedelic drugs.
Leary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the "Houseboat Summit") announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, "I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'"
During his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the "PC is the LSD of the 1990s" — "turn on, boot up, jack in" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture.

Château de Bouges

The Château de Bouges is an 18th-century mansion in the town of Bouges-le-Château, in the Indre "département" of France, in the Loire Valley. It is classified as a "monument historique" and the gardens are listed by the Ministry of Culture as among the Notable Gardens of France. The château and gardens are open to the public. 
History.
The château was built in 1765, probably by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, on lands acquired by Charles-François Leblanc de Manarval, the master of the royal forges and the director of the royal manufacturer of cloth in Châteauroux. The château was modeled after the Petit Trianon at the Palace of Versailles. In 1818, the château became the property of Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, the former foreign minister of Napoleon Bonaparte. Talleyrand put it at the disposition of his niece and, according to rumors, his one-time mistress, Dorothée de Courlande (1793-1862), who held successively the titles of Comtesse Edmond de Périgord (1809), Duchesse de Dino (1817), Duchesse de Talleyrand (1838) and finally Duchesse de Sagan (1845). She was also owner from 1828 à 1847 of the Château de Rochecotte at Saint-Patrice.Then chateau was purchased by Tunisian general Mahmoud Benaiad. 
In 1917, the château was purchased by Henry Viguier and his wife, Renée Normant, who restored it, decorated and refurnished it. Viguier was the président-directeur-général of the Paris department store Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville. In addition to the château, he owned a Paris town house on the avenue Foch, a manor house in Houlgate and a villa in Grasse. The Viguiers, who had no children, left the house and its furniture to the French state in 1968. 
The château and the park were location scenes in the film "Le Colonel Chabert" with Gérard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant.
The château has a park of eighty hectares, which include a landscape garden, an arboretum, a floral garden created in 1920, large greenhouses, and a formal French garden. It also includes large stables which were later used as garages by the last owners.

<doc id="18302791" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18302791" title="Eurasian Youth Union">
Eurasian Youth Union

Eurasian Youth Union (; ESM) is a Russian political organization, the youth wing of the Eurasia Party headed by Aleksandr Dugin. The organization has branches in several countries. The Government of Ukraine has branded the ESM as an extremist, anti-Ukrainian organization, convicted of a string of vandalism offenses and banned it in Ukraine.
Ideology.
According to some observers the Eurasian Youth Union was created as a reaction to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the role the younger generation played in it. It is suggested that ESM represents an opposition to a Ukrainian youth organization PORA. 
The early-20th century Eurasianism ideology of a part of the Russian emigration and modern Neo-Eurasianism developed by Aleksandr Dugin has been declared the main ideology of the organization. Its ideology also features prominently Russian nationalism and imperialism, calls for the creation of a new Eurasian empire centered around Russia. On its website the movement declared the West and in particular the United States as its main opponent and termed it as the "main evil". 
In its internal policy the ESM supports the current government of Russia and in particular its President, Vladimir Putin. Some also claim, that the movement receives taciturn support from the Russian Government eager to see a movement opposed to a possibility of an Orange Revolution happening in Russia.
Activities.
In Russia the Eurasian Youth Union has allied itself with Russian extremist organizations like the National Bolshevik Front, the DPNI and other groups of that type. It organizes and takes part in the annual Russian Marches in Russia and other countries of Eastern Europe. Very often these marches are accompanied by violence, especially in Ukraine. 
The ESM took an uncompromising approach to changes that happened in Ukraine after the Orange Revolution in 2004. In particular it set up branches in several Ukrainian cities, voiced its sharp criticism of the pro-Western Ukrainian government. The ESM has been behind a string of attacks on property and organizations they deemed pro-Western. It organised attacks on several Ukrainian Security Service branches, monuments to UPA veterans and hacker attacks on the website of the President of Ukraine. The most prominent of these attacks, that received nation-wide attention was the desecration of Ukrainian state symbols on Mount Hoverla in October 2007. The other attack on Ukrainian targets was in Moscow, where several of ESM members trashed an exhibition devoted to the Holodomor, a term referring to the Ukrainian portion of the Soviet famine of 1932-1933, which is believed in Ukraine to have been a Stalinist genocide targeting Ukrainians. Due to the relatively high profile of these attacks the Ukrainian police asked for assistance from Russia in finding people responsible for them, but no suspects have been apprehended yet.
The organization's vandalism and sharp anti-governmental stance received wide condemnation among Ukrainian media and provoked the response from different Ukrainian organizations of the opposite orientation; several threats were made against the organization and its members and an arson attack has been reciprocated on the ESM's offices in Moscow. 
By the decision of the courts the Eurasian Youth Organization has been banned in Ukraine, its leaders Dugin and Zarifullin declared personae non grata.

Fáelchar ua Máele Ódrain

Fáelchar Ua Máele Ódrain (died 693) or Fáelchar mac Forandla was a King of Osraige in modern County Kilkenny. 
He is called the grandson of Máel Ódra in the Irish annals. The genealogies state that Máel Ódra was the son of Scannlan Mór mac Colmáin (died 644), a previous king of Osraige. The father of Fáelchar is named as Forandl. The dynasty that ruled over Osraige in the early Christian period was known as the Dál Birn. He may have ruled from 678-693.
Osraige was part of the kingdom of Munster at this time and conflicts between Osraige and the men of Leinster, the Laigin, are recorded in the annals for the seventh and eight centuries. In 693, Fáelchar was slain in a battle with the Laigin.
His son Cellach mac Fáelchair (died 735) was also King of Osraige.

Piedmont Number One

Piedmont Number One is a former textile plant and former National Historic Landmark in Piedmont, Greenville County, South Carolina. It burned in 1983.
Piedmont Manufacturing Company.
The Piedmont Manufacturing Company was established by Henry Pinckney Hammett in 1873. Over the next few years, it constructed a textile mill and village at Garrison Shoals on the Saluda River at the present location of Piedmont. Piedmont Number One, which opened in 1876, was a four-story brick factory with an L-shaped floor plan. Powered by a water wheel, it had 5,000 spindles and 112 looms. Piedmont Number One was enlarged in 1880 and again in 1900. In 1888, Piedmont Number Two, was built on the west bank of the Saluda River in Anderson County. In 1892, the mills operated 47,000 spindles and 1,300 looms.
Because the mill was built where the water power was available, the Piedmont mill village was constructed for its employees. The village included houses for its employees, schools, churches, and other buildings. The village houses and stores were sold to private owners in the 1950s. By 1977, Piedmont Number One was no longer manufacturing textiles.
In recognition of its role in the Southern textile industry, Piedmont Number One was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978. Because of significant modifications to its building, Piedmont Number Two was not also designated.
A fire in October 1983 destroyed much of Piedmont Number One. The ruins were demolished. Its National Historic Landmark and National Register of Historic Places designations were deleted on March 5, 1986.

Watanabe E9W

__NOTOC__
The Watanabe E9W was a Japanese submarine-borne reconnaissance seaplane, the first aircraft designed by Watanabe Ironworks.
Development and design.
In January 1934, the Imperial Japanese Navy had a requirement for a two-seat reconnaissance seaplane to be operated from its J-3 type submarines, and placed an order with Watanabe for design and development of an aircraft to meet this requirement, the first of three prototypes flying in February 1935.
The E9W was a two-seat single-engine twin-float unequal-span seaplane designed to be easily dismantled for hangar stowage on a submarine, capable of being reassembled in two minutes 30 seconds and disassembled in one minute 30 seconds. It was armed with a 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine gun operated by the observer. Following successful testing of one of the prototypes on the submarine "I-5", an order for a production batch of 32 aircraft, designated E9W1, was placed.
Operational history.
The aircraft entered service in 1938 with the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service as the Navy Type 96 Small Reconnaissance Seaplane with the last being delivered in 1940. Although it was in the process of being replaced by the Yokosuka E14Y monoplane, it was still in front line service at the time of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, remaining in service until July 1942, being used to direct their parent submarines onto Chinese ships attempting to pass the Japanese blockade of the South China Sea. The E9W1 was given the reporting name Slim in 1942 by the Allies of World War II.

Architecture domain

An architecture domain in enterprise architecture is a broad view of an enterprise or system. It is a partial representation of a whole system that addresses several concerns of several stakeholders. It is a description that hides other views or facets of the system described. 
Overview.
Since Stephen Spewak's book called Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) in 1993, and perhaps before then, it has been normal to recognise four types of architecture domain:
Note that the applications architecture is about the application portfolio, not the internal architecture of a single application - which is often called the application architecture.
Many EA frameworks combine data and application domains into a single layer, sitting below the business (usually a human activity system) and above the technology (the platform IT infrastructure). There are many variations on this theme.
Typical architecture domains.
Typical architecture domains are listed below, and defined drawing on the definitions found in The British Computer Society's "Reference Model for Enterprise and Solution Architecture".

Leon Bates (American labor leader)

Leon E. Bates Sr. (December 3, 1899 – July 25, 1972) was an American labor union leader with the United Auto Workers union (UAW) from 1937 to 1964 when he retired as an "International Representative" of the UAW. He was one the first African-American union organizers to work for the "UAW-CIO" (Congress of Industrial Organizations).
Biography.
Leon Bates was born in Carrollton, Missouri, to Werner Bates and Matilda (White) Bates.
He attended the "Lincoln Institute" now Lincoln University of Missouri at Jefferson City, Missouri, for one year before moving to Detroit with relatives to seek work opportunities in the manufacturing plants during the boom years around the First World War. At the end of the war he remained in Detroit while his relatives returned to Carrollton. In Detroit he met and married Anna L. Perry; they had two children. In his own words he had many different jobs in the years between the World Wars, including cab driver, common laborer, and he even considered trying his hand at home-made liquor during Prohibition. However, his bootleg liquor-making thoughts were very short lived as he was convinced that every knock at the door would be the police. The Detroit Police Department had a very long and well-deserved reputation of police abuse and abusive tactics, and he had no desire to go to prison.
By 1935, Mr. Bates was working at the Briggs Manufacturing Company of Detroit, Michigan; a company founded in 1909 by Walter Briggs, Sr.. Walter Briggs, Sr. had worked his way up to Vice President of the B.F. Everitt Company (car body makers) in 1906. In 1909 he acquired the Everitt Company and incorporated it in to the newly formed Briggs Manufacturing Company. Briggs Manufacturing would later become one of the country's largest auto body manufacturers; supplying parts to Ford, Chrysler, Packard, Hudson Motors, Studebaker and many others. Briggs Manufacturing became a division of the Chrysler Corporation in 1956.
Organizing.
The 1920s and 1930s were difficult, but exciting times in America, especially for the labor movement. The coal miners, the Pullman Porters, the Teamsters were all making great strides in organizing workers, but paying a very high price for that success.
The United Mine Workers would be involved in one of the longest and bloodiest fights of their history in 1920 and 1921. The violence began on May 19, 1920 when simmering hostilities between mine workers trying to organize and the private detectives hired by the mine owners trying to keep the union out, boiled over in the tiny community of Matewan, West Virginia in what has come to be known as the Battle of Matewan. The violence culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain where 10,000 to 15,000 armed miners confronted police, militia, and private detectives in August 1921. It finally took military intervention by the Federal government to restore peace to the area.
The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was organized by the predominantly Negro Pullman Porters in 1925. The "BSCP" suffered through a lengthy fight to achieve recognition by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1935. BSCP signed its first collective bargaining agreement with the Pullman Company in 1937.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, formerly known as "International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America", had been involved in an intense struggle to organize since 1901. Between 1901 and 1935, the Teamsters engaged in countless small and large bloody and deadly confrontations over the right to organize and collectively bargain for wages and working conditions. As their early name implies, the Teamsters took in the related workers in order to strengthen its bargaining position with owners and management.
UAW years.
While at Briggs, Mr. Bates became involved in the organized labor movement, he worked passionately for the organized labor cause at Briggs. By 1937, the UAW-CIO had organized and signed a collective bargaining agreement with the Briggs Manufacturing Company. Through that effort Leon Bates became one of the most outspoken union stewards of UAW Local #212. In 1937 Briggs was the fourth largest employer of Negroes in the Detroit area with more than 1,300 or approximately 10% of its total payroll. The UAW-CIO was keenly aware of this fact; so their leadership made the decision to include the Negro workers in the organizing efforts. This decision ran contrary to the social, economic, and business norms of the day as the vast majority of labor unions were segregated at that time and simply would not accept Negro membership. The UAW-CIO was so concerned about the issue of Negro participation that the UAW-International Office sent out a letter encouraging each local to elect at least one Negro delegate to its 1937 convention. Leon Bates was one of two Negro delegates elected to represent Local #212 at the 1937 UAW convention. Even though the UAW had organized Briggs, not all of its employees were union members; in 1937 Local #212 renewed its efforts organise the remaining employees. Placing special emphasis on the Negro employees Local #212 formed a "Negro organizing committee" composed of the Negro union stewards. Each of them was tasked with recruitment in department and assigned areas without a steward. At the time Chief Steward Leon Bates, had 81 men men assigned to his department on his shift, all but two were members of Local #212.
1937 was a big year for the UAW. They had organized Chrysler and General Motors and they were having a significant amount of success with organizing the smaller parts suppliers and manufacturers, "i.e.," Midland Steel Products, Kelsey-Hayes, Bohn Aluminum, Fisher Body, and Timken Axle.
The UAW had been working on organizing the Ford Motor Company employees for some time, then came May 26, 1937 and the UAW's clash with the Ford Motor Company security guards sometimes known as the "Ford Service Department", led by Harry Bennett. This violent confrontation has come to be known as the Battle of the Overpass. Just before the afternoon shift change the UAW organizers were posing for press photographers when they were suddenly and viciously attacked by Ford security guards at gate #4 of the Ford River Rouge Complex. The violence was a publicity nightmare for Ford. Henry Ford had repeatedly stated that he would never sign an agreement with any union. Ford had gone out of his way to undermine the UAW's efforts at his plant. When token donations to Detroit charities and churches were not enough, Ford turned to Harry Bennett and the Ford Service Department with its union busting tactics. Henry Ford also quietly gave money to Negro charities and churches, occasionally showing up at Negro church functions. Henry Ford used these occasions to enlist the help of Negro ministers to influence the Negro community of Detroit against the unions.
For their part, the UAW took some time to heal their wounds and refine their tactics, then they returned to the Ford organizing efforts.
In September 1940 the UAW intensified its efforts to organize Ford with the assistance of the CIO. John L. Lewis president of the United Mine Workers and president of CIO put the full support of the CIO behind the UAW's efforts. The CIO sent Michael Widman to Detroit to head-up the overall organizing drive. The UAW had previously appealed to the Negro workers, but now their efforts were being stepped up. For their part the UAW knew that if they were going to be successful they needed to organize and recognize every man in the plant that they could. At this point the UAW brought in seven Negro organizers, Leon Bates and John Conyers Sr. were the first hired. UAW president R. J. Thomas picked Local #212 president Emil Mazey to be the director of the UAW Negro organizing effort. From the UAW's prospective, Mazey was a logical and a safe choice. Mazey had come to prominence for his organizing work at Briggs during the sit-down strikes. Mazey was respected and trusted by the many Negro workers of Briggs and the Negro stewards. In 1937 Mazey had unseated Local #212's first president Homer Martin an avowed racist. Mazey ended the exclusion of negro workers at union social events and hired a Negro secretary over the objections of the White secretaries in the Local #212 office. Local #212 and had fought to eliminate racial pay differentials for equal work. Still the Negro organizers were not happy that a white man had been put in charge of the "Negro effort" and complained bitterly first to the UAW - Interracial Department and then directly to the UAW Executive Board. In response Walter Hardin (a Negro) was quickly transferred in from a Chicago assignment to be the coordinator.
The UAW divided the Ford organizing drive in Detroit into two separate districts and Westside headed by Leon Bates and John Conyers Sr. Each office had a staff of clerks and secretaries, and latter personnel to handle transportation issues were brought in. Bates and Conyers met with Ford workers in their homes, coffee shops, and restaurants, they met with larger groups at local churches. During the Ford drive the organizers worked extremely long hours, most of them outside of the office. The UAW created a family atmosphere by organizing wives clubs, they also strengthened their relationships with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Urban League, Michigan Democratic Party and the national Democratic Party.
The Ford organizing drive ended June 20, 1941 when the Ford Motor Company signed a collective bargaining agreement with the UAW-CIO. This was six months before the United States entered World War II after Japan attacked the U.S. Navy Base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941. With the agreements settled between the UAW and the "Big Three Automakers", the UAW-CIO Negro organizers found themselves squarely in the middle of a new battle. The United States was gearing up for the largest military effort in history, a two front war, when the conflict came to head on the home front in the form of "hate strikes" and "Jim Crow" policies. At Packard Motors, White workers had refused to work with Negro workers, after the plant managers refused to reassign the newly promoted and reassigned Negro workers citing the Fair Employment Practices Committee rules and the War Labor Board policies, in protest; the White workers walked off the job. As a result the Negro organizers found themselves in the unusual position of advocating for their union at the same time fighting to reform their union. Pushed by the Negro organizers, the UAW urged the U.S. Government to sanction the companies for the labor policies and practices. The UAW also enforced its own sanctions on its members; declaring the strikes improper and against union rules and policies, the UAW international ordered the employees back to work, or they would remove the local union leadership, and the UAW would support the termination of any and every participant of the strike who refused to return to work immediately.
In the summer of 1941 the dust was far from settling on many labor issues in and around the Detroit area, and the UAW leadership was becoming better organized and business savvy. Leon Bates accepted a new assignment in Indianapolis, Indiana. Even though Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Dodge, Packard, Hudson, and many other manufacturers had signed collective bargaining agreements many areas had yet to fully form local unions, ratify the agreements, or cease Jim Crow policies and practices. Even though the UAW-CIO had an official non-discrimination policy and position; many locals had segregated divisions and some plants had altogether separate locals which were segregated. This was the situation in many Indianapolis plants when Leon Bates arrived as a staff representative of the UAW's International Office. One of his first and toughest assignments was the International Harvester Foundry, on Brookville Road, on Indianapolis's far East Side. At the time International Harvester maintained a Jim Crow system of management at its Indianapolis Foundry with two Locals (Local #226 and #998). Officially the division was because of skill and job classification "i.e.," local #998 was the local that Mold Makers, Millwrights, Electricians, Pipefitters, Machine Operators, etc. belonged to. Local #226 consisted of Laborers, Loaders, and Helpers which were considered Negro jobs. During the war, and through the civil rights era Leon Bates worked on behalf of the UAW cause, and for job equality; often these were not the same thing.
One of Mr. Bates' duties was to regularly visit the surrounding local unions; to assist with organizing efforts, "elected official" union training, grievance resolution, and discrimination investigation. He had to drive many miles through many small unfriendly towns; long before the modern interstate highway system at the height of the Jim Crow era in the United States. He had to drive for extended periods with nowhere to rest, sometimes sleeping in his car because hotels would not allow Negroes to stay in their establishments. When he arrived in a town with no accommodations for Negroes; he would then find a semi friendly Gas Station where he would be allowed to "freshen-up" in a rest room; in order to present a professional appearance to the company management and local union members. Sometimes when he would visit small communities he would be welcomed by local Negro families and Negro churches, who gratefully provide him with a home cooked meal and a place to rest.
Although he was an UAW Representative, Mr. Bates was known to give harsh verbal reprimands to UAW members who were not pulling their own weight on the job, and trying to hide behind union membership for protection. Mr Bates also served in the capacity of Director of the International Harvester Council which served as the committee that represented all the Locals whose members worked for the that company. He also served at the time of retirement, as Director of the Skilled Trades Council. This Council represented all Skilled Trades members. These Councils also had duties that included them as members of the Bargaining Committee which bargained for the National Contract for their respected members.
Retirement.
In 1964 Leon Bates retired from the UAW as an International Representative of the UAW. He and his wife Anna moved permanently from Indianapolis to their lake front vacation home in the small community of Idlewild, Michigan. His retirement was an active one, he was appointed UAW Region 3 Representative for Retirees, and immediately got himself elected Yates Township, Lake County, Michigan Supervisor and County Board Member. He was the first African American elected to the Lake County, Michigan Board of Commissioners. He continued to work in Democratic Party Politics at both the state and national levels traveling to events and functions across the region and country. At the time of his death in 1972 he was running for reelection (and favored to win his third term) as Township Supervisor, when he fell from his boat and drowned in Lake Idlewild.
His funeral was attended by both State and National Democratic Party Officials, UAW Officials, he was eulogized by then UAW President Leonard Woodcock and UAW Secretary - Treasurer Emil Mazey.
UAW Local #226's Union Hall in Indianapolis, is named "Reuther - Bates Hall" in memory of Walter Reuther and Leon Bates.
Leon Bates is buried in the Yates Township Cemetery in Idlewild, Michigan.
Leon Bates was an extraordinary man, besides having an imposing physical presence. He left a lasting impression on the people he met, so much so, that more than 35 years after his death people who knew him, out of respect and fond memories of him, still refer to him as Mr. Bates.

The Professionals (hip-hop)

The Professionals are an American hip-hop duo based out of Lakeland, Florida, a small city between Tampa and Orlando, Florida. The group's musical style is often referenced as a mixture of true East Coast hip-hop, with influences of Dirty South, Rock and Soul music. The duo consists of Florida natives Garrett "G-Wes" Wesley and Kevin "Tygerstylez" Davis. The group's music has been featured on MTV, as well as various music compilations and soundtracks.
Biography.
The Beginning (2000).
G-Wes and Tygerstylez met in 2000 at Geico in Lakeland, Florida, where they both worked. G-Wes began making music using MTV's Music Generator and his Sony PlayStation 2 to make beats which allowed them to write in lieu of professional production. Originally dubbing themselves the "Ill Emcees", the duo later changed its name to The Professionals, citing the movie "The Professional" as a major influence in their music and personal style. The group was originally a trio until the third member, Rico, removed himself from the group and moved away. The group's earliest tracks were produced by Thomas Love with a simple beat machine in his garage. Their underground single ""Just Gettin' Started"" was written and produced in just over an hour and was well received in the local underground music scene.
Tired of the culture consistent with today's hip-hop/rap music (gaudy jewelry, extra-long t-shirts, guns, materialism, etc.) the group wanted to stand out from other acts. The group is heavily inspired by The Blues Brothers and the Redman's "Whateva Man" video which also draws from The Blues Brothers. G-Wes & Tygerstylez perform in black suits and ties with white dress shirts layered underneath. G-Wes typically wears a cap while Tygerstylez often wears a bandana and/or black gloves. Keeping true to their hip-hop roots while remaining comfortable on stage, the group complete their wardrobe with classic Adidas Superstar shelltoe shoes. Their look is referenced on their song ""Black Suit"."
While continuing their full-time jobs, the duo released an EP in 2004 titled ""Dangerous"", which was led by the single of the same name. Looking to upgrade their production, the album was produced by Rafael Torres of UP2U Music with contributions by G-Wes. The album was not sold, but distributed freely to labels, record executives, A&Rs and the general public. After releasing the EP, the group began writing more music with the purpose of releasing a full album. A mixtape track titled "Chaos", which featured instrumentals produced by The Neptunes and Wu-Tang Clan has been immensely popular and die-hard fans consider the track The Professionals' best work to date. The group continued to push ""Dangerous"" and managed to get their music featured on 93.3 FLZ and Wild 98.7, and while the music was well-received, the group did not receive the notoriety they were seeking.
Hiatus (2005-2006).
In late 2007, there was speculation the group would disband and go their separate ways after keeping relatively quiet with no new music released in 2005 or 2006 and only one live performance. It was believed that G-Wes was looking to compose and perform new music whenever possible while Tygerstylez had a distinct direction on where the group should be headed. Fans of the group credit this supposed disagreement as the basis for the group's inactivity. G-Wes, always looking to expand and experiment musically, would later help form "Project Reign", a rap/rock/metal band with friends Mike Barfield and Adam Klatka while continuing work on his Internet podcast, "The Cousin Jay & Garrett Show" with childhood friend Adam "Cousin Jay" Ward. Tygerstylez returned to his original love of mixed martial arts and participated in various contests in Florida. While they both headed in different directions, G-Wes and Tygerstylez were merely pursuing their other interests with full intention to returning to the group in 2008. G-Wes, in an interview in 2007 stated "with different priorities in my life and Kevin's (Davis), "The Professionals are on hiatus until we can both devote more time to the group."
The Return (2008).
After a break of nearly two years, The Professionals returned to making music in 2008. The year has indeed proven to be one of resurgence for the group as they have contributed music for various television shows, movies, and music compilations and soundtracks. The single "Dangerous" was featured during the fourth season of MTV's Making the Band. The group is also composing tracks for the upcoming movie "Stiletto".
Frustrated by the lack of music venues and musical gatherings in Polk County, Florida, the group, along with fellow local act Hierarchy, created the Central Florida Music Showcase. According to G-Wes, the showcase was created to "not just provide a way for hip-hop and urban acts to be seen, but to also provide an outlet for performers of all genres in Central Florida." The first show was held May 24, 2008 at the Theatre Winter Haven, becoming the first urban music act to ever be held at the historic theatrical venue. The nearly four-hour show, hosted by comedian Tony B., featured fellow local acts Hierarchy, Saiah, C.B., Twan D the Student, Deshun, and Yung Kelz.
Future projects.
The group is currently writing and soliciting tracks for their release scheduled in 2009 titled ""The Definition""(unconfirmed title). The group plans to incorporate more melody and a host of different sounds into the new album by enlisting guitarist Mike Barfield and (unconfirmed) guest appearances by Twan D the Student, Deshun, Saiah and others. The rumored first single, ""Black Suit"", was previously leaked to music download sites such as Limewire and Morpheus but was later removed and has not been found for download since.

USS Nokomis (SP-609)

USS "Nokomis" (SP-609) was a yacht purchased by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was outfitted as a patrol craft with 3-inch guns, and assigned to protect commercial shipping in the North Atlantic Ocean from German submarines and Q-ships. Post-war she was returned to the U.S. and decommissioned. Subsequently, she was placed back into service as a survey vessel, a role she maintained for nearly two decades before again being decommissioned and struck from the Navy List.
Built in Delaware.
The first ship to be so named by the U.S. Navy, "Nokomis" was a yacht built as "Nokomis II" by Pusey & Jones, Wilmington, Delaware, in 1914. The Navy purchased the yacht from Horace E. Dodge of Detroit, Michigan 1 June 1917. The ship was renamed "Nokomis" 19 November 1917 and was commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 3 December 1917.
World War I service.
North Atlantic Ocean duty.
Fitted out at Philadelphia, "Nokomis" sailed for Bermuda 19 December with a French submarine chaser in tow. She departed Bermuda for Brest, France, 8 January 1918, stopping en route at the Azores and Leixões, Portugal. Operating with the U.S. Patrol Squadron for the remainder of the war, she helped protect American troop transports approaching the coast of France.
"Nokomis" spent the rest of the conflict on patrol and escort duty off western France, and remained in European waters for several months after the November 1918 Armistice brought an end to the fighting.
Reclassified as a survey ship.
Terminating this duty in 1919, "Nokomis" returned to the United States in August. Reclassified PY–6 in 1920, the yacht decommissioned at New York City 25 February 1921. 
Outfitted as a ship's tender for the Naval Governor of Santo Domingo in July 1921, she did not assume this duty, but conducted surveys in Mexican and Caribbean waters under direction of the Hydrographic Office.
Final decommissioning.

The Seorak Cultural Festival is a local cultural festival annually held every end of October in Sokcho city, Gangwon Province, South Korea. Sokco is a tourism city surrounded by Mt. Seoraksan National Park and the Sea of Japan (East Sea), so many of the cultural events there are mostly related to the environment and local specialties such as squid.
The festival has been established to promote unity among local residents and Korean traditional folk culture rooted in Sokcho. During the festival period, the local citizens and tourists participate in several events regarding the sea and mountain such as a climbing competition, visiting Seoraksan National Park, a "gaetbae" (ship)-dragging competition, a fishing competition, trundling of "heundeul bawi" (흔들바위; literally "swinging rock"), and the tasting of squid dishes.

Úrsula

Úrsula is a fictional character in the TV series Skimo. She is a main protagonist in the show, and is portrayed by actress Tatiana Martinez.
Personality.
Úrsula is the rebellious and intelligent friend of Fito and Tavo, who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. She is very handy, fixing almost any gadget. Normally, she is seen reading or listening to her iPod. She is cool and very resourceful, thinking logically in most situations. She always wants Fito and Tavo to use their brains to solve their problems.
Ursula's manner of dresses is what some would call "rebel" or "punk". She partly dyed her hair pinkish red after the first season.
Relations with other characters.
Tavo.
Úrsula at first, only liked Tavo as a friend, although he was in love with her since season 1. When Ursula kissed Tavo (to give him disgust), he starts to feel something for her, and a few episodes later he imagines kissing her. At the end of the first season Tavo tells Ursula that he wants to be her boyfriend, but she rejects this. In the second season, Ursula continues to spend time with him. In the third season, Ursula becomes jealous of Tavo's "girlfriend" since she fell in love with him. At the end of season 3, when it was assumed that a piano fell on Tavo's head, she told him she loved him. In the fourth season Ursula and Tavo decided to forget the hospital thing and keep everything personal, but Cris suspects that somethings going on between Tavo and Ursula and swears that she will find out.
In the last episode of the show, Ursula leaves high school and accepts Tavo's proposal to have a romantic relationship.
Fito.
Ursula and Fito were never on good terms; they always insulted each other, such as Fito calling Ursula a witch, but in spite of that Ursula falls in love with him since he kissed her to see how Tavo would react. At the end of the second season Ursula tells Fito about her feelings towards him, but he does not understand and Tavo had to move to Aguascalientes. Ursula's feelings for Fito disappeared early in the third season, when they went to look for Tavo in Aguascalientes.

Forbasach mac Ailella

Forbasach mac Ailella (died 740) was a King of Osraige in modern County Kilkenny. He ruled from 735 to 740. 
His genealogy is not recorded in "Rawlinson Genealogies", however the "Book of Leinster" king lists name an Ailill mac Fáeláin as king prior to Cellach mac Fáelchair (died 735). This Ailill would be the brother of Cú Cherca mac Fáeláin (died 712) and son of Fáelán mac Crundmaíl (died 660), previous kings.
The annals record only that he was slain but give no details. His son Fáelán mac Forbasaig (died 786) was a King of Osraige.

Kapitsa–Dirac effect

The Kapitsa–Dirac effect is a quantum mechanical effect consisting in the diffraction of a well-collimated particle beam (often an electron beam), by a standing wave of light. 
The effect was first predicted by Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac and Pyotr Kapitsa in 1933.
The effect is explained by the wave–particle duality, as stated by the de Broglie hypothesis in 1924. 
As a consequence of the wavelike nature of particles, a coherent beam of particles should be diffracted by the spatially periodic electromagnetic field structure set up by a standing electromagnetic wave, and should interfere with itself (the intensity of the particle beam should vary in with distance, presenting several maxima and minima, like in optical diffraction patterns).
A highly-coherent light beam is required for the realization of the experiment, and couldn't be realized before the invention of lasers. The most effective experiment that show the expected diffraction peaks was carried out in 2001.

David Greenfield (author)

Dr. David Neil Greenfield (born. June 15, 1956, in Bronx, New York) and is a practicing psychologist, author, lecturer, and professor. He is currently the director of The Center for Internet and Technology Addiction in West Hartford, Connecticut. He has been practicing since 1987 and has been an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine since 2000. Dr Greenfield is the Author of the 1999 book, entitled: “Virtual Addiction”, which was one of the earliest books on the topic on Internet and Computer Addiction. Dr. Greenfield is recognized as one of the early pioneers in the field of Internet, Digital Media, and Technology Addiction.
College Education.
Upon graduating Paramus High School in 1974, Dr. Greenfield first attended Bergen Community College in Paramus, New Jersey from 1974-1975; he then transferred to Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey where he completed his B.A. with honors in Psychology 
After receiving his B.A. he enrolled at New York University from 1978 through 1980, receiving a Masters in Counseling. The following year he enrolled in Texas Tech University’s Psychology department and eventually received his PH.D. in Counseling Psychology in 1986. While at Texas Tech, Dr. Greenfield completed additional coursework and clinical training for a doctoral minor in Marital, Family, and Child Psychotherapy. Prior to completing his degree he completed an Internship in Clinical Psychology at the McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, from 1985-1986. While at McGuire VA Medical Center he completed rotations on the Alcohol and Substance Abuse/Addictions unit, Neurology, and Inpatient Psychiatry. He then went on to begin a Residency in Clinical Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, completing it at Fairfield Hills Hospital in Newtown, Connecticut.
Early career.
After completing his education and fulfilling his requirements for Psychologist licensure in the states of New York (1988) and Connecticut (1987) he continued as a staff psychologist at Fairfield Hills Hospital until 1988; after leaving Fairfield Hills Hospital he on to a half-time psychologist position at Elmcrest Psychiatric Institute in Portland, Connecticut until 1990. In 1995 Dr. Greenfield received additional CT licensure in Marriage and Family Therapy, and Certification in Alcohol and other Psychoactive Substance Use Disorders from the APA College of Professional Psychology in 1996, and was certified by The National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology, in 1989. 
In 1990, Dr. Greenfield went into full-time private practice and shortly thereafter co-founded Psychological Health Associates, LLC (PHA) with former wife Dr. Marci Korwin and Texas Tech roommate Dr. Andrew Margin. PHA has offices West Hartford and Danbury, Connecticut. Dr Greenfield remained partner there until 2005 when went on to found The Healing Center, LLC also in West Hartford, Connecticut. In or around 1999 after conducting research in collaboration with ABCNEWS.com and Publishing his book Dr. Greenfield recognized a new a burgeoning need for specialized addictions treatment in the area of Internet Addiction and Computer use, abuse and addiction. At this time he founded, The Center for Internet Studies, which later became the Center for Internet Behavior, and more recently found its current and final identity, as The Center for Internet and Technology Addiction.
Pioneering Work on Internet and Technology Addiction.
In 1996 Greenfield developed an active professional interest in the then, unknown field of computer and Internet addiction. His initial interest was sparked by his personal experience when he went on-line in 1995 and found himself captivate by the experiences and he discovered what he later as a “loss of time and space” or dissociation as well as an uncanny feeling of disinhibition, wherein one might do and say things online that they might not ordinarily do. What seemed readily apparent to Greenfield was that the Internet medium was itself psychoactive or mood-altering. It was also around that time that he saw a small pilot study written by Dr Kimberly Young on comparing heavy Internet use to compulsive gambling. At this time he began to study and write about, along with Dr. Alvin Cooper, the issue of on-line sexual behavior and cyber affairs in an articles entitled “Crossing the line on-line" At this point Dr.Greenfield’s interest and background in electronics and technology would begin to merge with his professional a Psychologist with a background in Addictionology. He started his research on the subject later that year by conducting the world's first large-scale study on internet and computer behavior and then publishing his results in a paper entitled "Psychological Characteristics of Compulsive Internet Use: A Preliminary Analysis".[http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.1999.2.403] This paper was first presented at the 1990 American Psychological Association convention in Boston, Massachusetts and later published in journal "Cyber-Psychology and Behavior"; upon presenting this paper there was widespread media interest (which has remained high in this topic), as this was the first time there was larger-scale with any scientific or medical proof that Internet use could be addictive. Greenfield’s results demonstrated that approximately 4.9% of Internet users met the criteria for Internet addiction with notable negative life consequences, similar to other alcohol and other substance and behavioral addictions. 
Current Career and Lectures and Publications.
Dr. Greenfield, along with running his West Hartford, Connecticut treatment practice, lectures throughout the U.S. and internationally on the topic of Internet and Technology Addiction, Cyber-psychology, and Digital Media Use and abuse. He also lectures about the impact technology is having on society and human relationships. Dr. Greenfield consults with attorneys on legal matters involving Internet Use, and consults with business and industry on the impact that technology has on productivity. In his clinical practice his specialties include Internet and Technology Addiction, IMAGO marital and relationship therapy, EMDR, as well anxiety and trauma issues. Dr Greenfield is past-president and Fellow of The Connecticut Psychological Association and currently serves as Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University Of Connecticut School Of Medicine since 2000. He was won numerous awards and distinctions, including the 1995 Award for Outstand Contribution to the Practice of Psychology in CT, and the 1999 Recipient of the American Psychological Association’s “Heiser Presidential Award for Professional Psychology Advocacy.
Dr. Greenfield has appeared on CNN, Good Morning America, The Today Show, CBS Early Show, Fox News, and NBC News. His work has also been featured in U.S. News and World Report, Business Week, Newsweek, People, Time, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and numerous other popular publications. He is recognized as one of the world’s leading authorities on Internet and computer behavior and digital media technology--including it’s’ use and abuse. Dr. Greenfield’s recent work is focused why digital technologies are so addictive and on how we as a society can use technology in a more balanced and healthy manner.

16th Light Cavalry

The 16th Light Cavalry is a regiment of the Armoured Corps, a primary combat arm of the Indian Army. Prior to India gaining independence from the British in 1947, it was a regular cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1776 and is the oldest armoured regiment raised in India. The 16th Light Cavalry saw service in a number of conflicts ranging from the Second Anglo-Mysore War in 1781 to World War II. It has a number of battle honours including "Punjab 1965" earned during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.
History.
Formation.
The Regiment was raised prior to 1776 as the 3rd Regiment of Native Cavalry in the service of the Nawab of Arcot. In 1780, while under service with the British East India Company, it formed part of the force that defeated Hyder Ali during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and was awarded battle honours for the "Battle of Sholinghur", "Battle of Mysore", "Battle of Carnatic" and the "Battle of Seringapatam" for service during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. 
After the Anglo-Mysore Wars the Regiment was next in action during the Third Anglo-Burmese War and were awarded the Battle Honour of "Burma 1885-87".
Early 20th Century.
During World War I (1914–1918) the regiment remained in India for the defence of the North West Frontier but they did send drafts to other Indian cavalry regiments serving in France and the Middle East. In 1919 the regiment was involved in the brief Third Afghan War, for which they were awarded the battle honour of "Afghanistan 1919".
World War II.
During World War II the regiment was employed in the defence of India having converted from horses to armour at Quetta in 1941.
In 1945 they were selected to undertake operations in Burma. Within three weeks the Regiment covered a distance of 3,500 miles from Quetta to the banks of Irrawady River and was personally complimented by General Slim, the Fourteenth Army commander.
In Burma the regiment was attached to the 255th Indian Tank Brigade, the brigade formation was;

Bridge 19-40 Canal Society

The Bridge 19-40 Canal Society is a Scottish waterway society and registered charity operating community boats on the Union Canal, with bases at Winchburgh and Drumshoreland, West Lothian.
History.
The former B.U.C.H.A.N. Society, a canal society from Broxburn, decided at their 1999 AGM to extend the area covered by the society, and to change its name. The new "Bridge 19-40 Canal Society" was to operate between Bridge 19 (the first bridge in West Lothian) and Bridge 40 (at Philpstoun). The new name was also meant to convey its role as a bridge between several local communities along the Union Canal.
Activities.
The society's aims include: 
Along with the Seagull Trust, the Linlithgow Union Canal Society, the Edinburgh Canal Society, Forth Canoe Club and other canal-based community groups and charities, Bridge 19-40 Canal Society has campaigned for the retention, renovation and re-use of the Scottish Lowland canals.
Bridge 19-40 regularly organises Water Safety trips for primary schools in West Lothian; their aim is to raise awareness among children about the potential dangers of water, and to discourage litter on the waterway.

Neleides

Nêleidês ( Nêleiadês, Nêleiusor Nêleidai) enter Greek mythology through the great Greek Homeric epics, transmitted 850-700 BC through the "oikos" of Neleus, son of the Greek god Poseidon, from the coastal Ionian colonies of Miletos (Paus.7.2.4), Ephesos (Strabo 14.1.3, and Kolophon (Mimnermos fr.9) directly populated from Nêleiad Pylos, or from Athens, through the Kodrid Kaukônes (Hdt.1.147), immigrants from Nêleid Triphylia (Hdt.4.148) who led the colonies east. Nêleus was a son of the seagod Poesidon Melanthos by Tyro (Hom. "Od".11.235-6), daughter of Thessalian Salmôneus, possibly accretions of the Eukrainian Tyras river (Hdt.4.27) serving the port of Olbios (modern Odessa), and the great "daimôn" of the Massagetai, Zalmoxis (Hdt.4.94-6). Reaching the Minyan seaport of Iolkos where Nêleus began his career, he and a Pelasgian band of cattle raiders reached Triphylian Arênê in the north at Homeric Pylos (Hom. "Il".11.685-705), where he and his distinguished son Nestôr, built their great trading port and kingdom. At Myceneaen Pylos in the south, ca.1200BC destroyed at Koryphasion by the Herakleidai (Hom. "Il".5.395-7), Linear B tablets (Ma90) refer to Pylos as pu-ro, and to Nêleus as ne-e-re. Nêleus brought his nobility to a higher level by marrying Theban Khlôris, daughter of Amphion, whose Demeter name "Khlôê," who by inference suggests she brought fruitful grain crops and cereal wealth to pastoral Peloponessos and so earned the title Pylos "Basilê", Queen. Waxing rich in herds of horses, cattle and sheep, in wheat and barley, and international trade, Nestôr heir to the kingdom enjoyed three generations of life, commanded a fleet of ninety ships to the Trojan War (Hom. "Il".2.591-604) and served as a Chief of Staff, leaving to posterity a son Peisistratos whose family with other Nêleidai (Pausanias 2.18.7-8) lead migrations to Athens and Ionia (Hdt.4.148, 1.147 Kaukônes above). Peisistratos II (669/8BC) served as an Athenian arkhon (Paus.2.24.7), and his grandson Peisistratos III (605-528BC) became, with his sons Hippias and Hipparkhos (both Poeison epithets), a dynasty of innovative Nêleiad tyrants (Hdt.5.65) that began Homeric poetic recitations at the great Panathenaic festival after 546BC, educated and inspired rural pastorals to read moralizing verse carved on square marble busts of Hermes (Plato "Hipparkhos" 228D), and reopened Black Sea trade through Sigeion (Hdt. 5.64).

Paradieswärts Düül

Paradieswärts Düül is a 1970 psychedelic rock album by the German band Amon Düül. It was the final Amon Düül (I) album to be recorded. In contrast to the communal, free-form improvisations of the earlier Amon Düül albums (generally thought to have all been recorded in a single "jam session" with various commune members coming and going throughout), Paradieswarts Düül was recorded with a smaller, more stable lineup of musicians. The pastoral, folk-influenced sound of the record has been compared to the gentler work of American bands Love and The Velvet Underground. The first word of the title is a German construction meaning "paradise-wards", as in "towards paradise".
The album was re-released on CD in 1996 by Spalax Records. This version added two bonus tracks, from the single "Eternal Flow / Paramechanical World" released slightly before the album. This same master was also used for the 1997 edition issued by Repertoire Records in Germany.
Though the groups had split apart some years before due to differing musical aims, the album features contributions from Amon Düül II members John Weinzierl and Chris 'Shrat' Thiele on the track "Paramechanische Welt". In turn Rainer and Ulrich of Amon Düül (I) had appeared on the track "Sandoz in the Rain" on Amon Düül II's album "Yeti", recorded the same year.

Daniel Page

Daniel D. Page (March 5, 1790April 29, 1869) was the second mayor of St. Louis, Missouri, United States.
Daniel Page was born in Parsonsfield, Maine in 1790. At the age of fifteen, he moved to Portland, Maine where he learned to be a baker, later setting up his own shop in Boston, Massachusetts. In Boston, he met and married Miss Deborah Young. Shortly thereafter, he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana and became established in the tobacco trading business. Despite his success, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1818 due to his wife's failing health as she was adversely affected by the climate in New Orleans.
Page was elected the mayor of St. Louis in 1829 and went on to serve four consecutive one-year terms. He was only the second mayor of St. Louis, the first being William Carr Lane who stepped down after serving six years in office. During his administration, many of the streets in St. Louis were graded and paved, a night watch was established for the protection of the citizens, and street cleaning and refuse collection were begun. Page also strengthened the Health Department and advocated for an improvement to public waterworks system.
After his tenure as mayor had ended, Page turned his attention to his business matters. In 1833, he built the first steam-powered flour mill in St. Louis. In 1848, he partnered with his son-in-law Henry D. Bacon and created the banking house of Page & Bacon. During this time, he invested heavily in railroads and real estate. Page & Bacon closed in 1855 on account of financial difficulties from building of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad.
Daniel Page died in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 1869 and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Page Boulevard in St. Louis was named in his honor.

In 1945, Coan was honored by "The Sporting News" as the "Minor League Player of the Year" while playing for the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association. He entered the majors in 1946 with the Washington Senators, playing for them eight years before joining the Baltimore Orioles (1954-1955), Chicago White Sox (1955) and New York Giants (1955-1956]). A line-drive hitter and speedy outfielder, he averaged 12 stolen bases from 1948–52, with a career-high 23 in 1948 (second in American League).
In 1947, Coan made 21 hits in 42 at bats for a .500 batting average to collect the highest BA for any player who had 30 or more at-bats in a major league season, setting a record that was surpassed by Rudy Pemberton in 1996 with a .512 BA (21-for-41). His most productive season came in 1951, when he posted career highs in home runs (9), runs batted in (62), runs (85) and games played (135) while hitting .303 (ninth in AL), equaling a personal mark he set the year before. He also tied a major league record he shares with four other players by hitting two triples in a same inning on April 21, 1951.

Kenny Hassan

Kenny Hassan (born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1966) was the host of the World Football Daily podcast. Hassan, a native Glaswegian, supports Rangers and is a self-admitted Arsenal "admirer" as well as being supportive and respectful of the achievements of A.C. Milan.
Hassan is also known for covering many different topics in football such as racism, hooliganism, safe standing and acceptance of the gay community in the sport.
Biography.
Hassan spent several years living in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Hassan is knowledgeable about the Bundesliga and German culture as well as being fluent in German. Kenny is also known for making up his own names for certain players. For example, Hassan refers to Rangers defender Carlos Bocanegra as Carlos "Boca Juniors"; Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker as "Mertz-cracker"; FC Barcelona midfielder Sergi Busquets as "Biscuits"; either Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt or Manchester United's Ji-Sung Park as "Ji-Sung Kuyt"; and either Tottenham Hotspur's Aaron Lennon or Queens Park Rangers's Shaun Wright-Phillips as "Shaun Wright-Lennon." Kenny is also an avid golfer. Kenny is a self-styled tactical expert in football.
Career.
Hassan initially started as a guest co-host on Sirius Satellite Radio's World Soccer Daily. He would often pair up with Steven Cohen, Nick Geber or Howard Rogers. He eventually replaced Howard Rogers in November 2006 after Rogers was let go from the show. Kenny then became the Monday through Friday co-host of World Soccer Daily when he and Steven Cohen were famously known for travelling the country and doing live-remote broadcasts during Champions League matches from locations in Boston, NY, Denver and Philadelphia. Kenny was with the show until its final broadcast in September 2009. Kenny then co-founded World Football Daily with Steven Cohen under a subscriber based model which had never been done before on any platform. Hassan then went on to become the lone host after Cohen had left the show in April 2011. 
On Monday, September 26, 2011 Hassan signed off for the last time as the host of World Football Daily. In leaving World Football Daily, Hassan left a fine legacy of promoting the "beautiful game" in the United States. In his five and a half years as host/co-host of World Football Daily he proved to be an expert in promoting the English Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, Primera and Ligue 1 in the United States. Hassan made himself known for not only informative tactical analysis on every league and entertaining debate but in bringing lively interviews with some of the best coaches, players and correspondents in the game from around the world.
The sudden departure of Hassan from his own show led to much speculation based on comments he had previously made regarding the formula of the show which he apparently did not agree with after long-time friend/partner Steven Cohen had left.

Anti Tank Guitar

The A.T.G. or Anti Tank Guitar is a large multi-stringed instrument that can express tones including and beyond the chromatic scale.
History.
The most notable A.T.G. was designed by Matthew Schultz in 1989. It was based on a conceptually designed instrument by experimental musician Brad Braun. Since 1990, Schultz has created five variations, named Mark I, Mark II, Mark III, Mark IV and Mark V respectively. It was most notably used in two musical projects; Lab Report and Pigface. It has appeared on 18 albums. It was described by Pigface vocalist Chris Connelly as "a large rail-way sleeper with piano wire which was stretched over the guitar so that it could be played..." Sonic Boom Magazine stated "The Anti Tank Guitar is still ever present as the bowel movement inducing tones that have made Lab Report more of an acoustic terrorist movement than a band since their inception." The instrument creates a wide array of sounds from mimicking a guitar and bass to massive percussive blows that often shut down public address systems during live performances.
A.T.G. - Mark II.
The Mark II was an eight foot 4"X4"X8' beam that suspended 10 strings. The 6 upper register of strings consisted of single gauge wires varying in size from 24 gauge to 18 gauge. The lower register consisted of 4 woven cables used in garage doors. The instrument utilized turnbuckles for tuning. It was often played with an EBow or cello bow as well as being hammered and/or plucked. This version of the instrument was used for "The Love Serenade (I Hate You?)" on the Pigface album Welcome to Mexico... Asshole. Various versions of the A.T.G. have appeared on other albums as well.
A.T.G. - Mark V.
As models evolved so did the design. The later versions became increasingly slim-lined and made of a ridged thin metal frames.

He earned a promotion to Double-A Montgomery for the last month of the season, along with third baseman Evan Longoria, and in 28 games with the Biscuits, he hit .300 with 3 HR, 16 RBI and 18 runs. He was a Mid and Post-Season All-Star in the California League, and he was named the League's MVP and Rookie of the Year. "Baseball America" rated Brignac as the 17th best MLB prospect in 2007 and 39th best in 2008.
Brignac was Montgomery's shortstop for 2007, where in 133 games and a league-leading (with Emilio Bonifacio) 596 plate appearances, he hit .260 with 17 HR, 81 RBI, a league-leading 91 runs and 30 doubles. After the year, he played with in the Arizona Fall League with Scottsdale, where he hit .177 (20-113) with 2 HR and 6 RBI in 26 games. Brignac began 2008 with Triple-A Durham as their shortstop, where he was hitting .265 with 7 HR and 38 RBI through the first 3 months.

Manager Joe Maddon said: "There's no question Reid is a Major League caliber shortstop. And I don't like the idea of him not playing defense for us. But moving down the road we have to get better on the offensive side of the ball." He was hitting .193 with 1 HR and 10 RBI in 68 games. After an 11-game stint in Durham, he was recalled on August 10 after outfielder Justin Ruggiano was placed on the disabled list. Brignac finished the year with Tampa Bay.

Vertical boiler

A vertical boiler is a type of fire-tube or water-tube boiler where the boiler barrel is oriented vertically instead of the more common horizontal orientation. Vertical boilers were used for a variety of steam-powered vehicles and other mobile machines, including early steam locomotives.
Design considerations.
Advantages.
The main advantages of a vertical boiler are:
Disadvantages.
The main disadvantages of a vertical boiler are:
Applications.
Railway locomotives.
Several manufacturers produced a significant number of vertical boiler locomotives. Notable amongst these were:
Steam lorries.
The Sentinel Waggon Works also produced a range of road lorries (steam wagons) based on their high-pressure vertical boilers
Steam tractors.
The Best Manufacturing Company of San Leandro in California produced a range of steam tractors that used vertical boilers.
Steam rollers.
Certain designs of steam roller departed from the conventional traction engine style of a horizontal boiler with an engine mounted above. Vertical-boilered rollers were built around a substantial girder frame chassis, with the boiler being mounted low down between the front and rear rolls. Such designs were not common in the UK. 
Steam donkeys.
The traditional form of steam donkey (as a mobile winch used in the logging industry) married a vertical boiler with a steam engine on a rigid base fitted with skids for mobility. Since the ground to be traversed would be rough and rarely level, the water-level -tolerant design of the vertical boiler was an obvious choice.
Steam shovels and cranes.
Construction equipment such as steam cranes and steam shovels used vertical boilers to good effect. On a rotating base, the weight of the boiler would help to counterbalance the load suspended from the shovel bucket or crane jib, mounted on the opposite side of the pivot from the boiler. The compact boiler footprint permitted smaller designs than would have been the case for a horizontal type, thus allowing use on smaller worksites; the extra height of a vertical boiler being less critical for such a generally-tall machine.
Marine applications.
Some steam boats, particularly smaller types such as river launches, were designed around a vertical boiler. The small footprint of the boiler permitting smaller, more space-efficient designs, with less of the usable vessel being occupied by the means of propulsion rather than the payload.
Stationary Applications.
Vertical types such as the Cochran boiler provided useful, small footprint, package solutions for many stationary applications, including process and space heating.

Pharyngeal teeth

Pharyngeal teeth are teeth in the pharyngeal arch of the throat of cyprinids, suckers, and a number of other fish species lacking teeth.
Many popular aquarium fish such as goldfish and loaches have these structures. Members of the "Botia" genus such as clown loaches are known to make distinctive clicking sounds when they grind their pharyngeal teeth. Grunts (family Haemulidae) are so called because of the sound they make when they grind them. Molas are said to be able to produce sound by grinding their long, claw-like pharyngeal teeth.
The Chinese high fin banded shark ("Myxocyprinus asiaticus") (family Catostomidae) has a single row of pharyngeal teeth with comb-like arrangements. The Cape Fear shiner (family Cyprinidae) only has pharyngeal teeth, similar to the teeth of other omnivorous shiners. The redear sunfish (family Centrarchidae) has thick pharyngeal teeth composed of hard, movable plates, which it uses to crush the exoskeletons of prey. The pharyngeal jaws of the moray eel (family Muraenidae) possess their own set of teeth. The dentary of the ghost knifefish species "Sternarchogiton nattereri" (family Apteronotidae) has upper and lower pharyngeal tooth plates bearing 9-11 and 7-9 teeth, respectively.
The mouth cone ("everted pharynx") of a possible new species of "Meiopriapulus", a marine worm in the Priapulida, bears pharyngeal teeth.
Fossils of the "Yunnanozoon" and "Haikouella" possess pharyngeal teeth.
The lower pharyngeal bones of cichlids also carry specialized teeth which augment their normal mandibular teeth in the breakdown of food.

Californication Tour

The Californication Tour was a worldwide concert tour by Red Hot Chili Peppers to support their seventh studio album "Californication" which saw the return of guitarist John Frusciante who rejoined the band in 1998 after quitting six years earlier. 
A DVD documenting the tour titled "Off the Map", which was made up of footage from different shows, was released in 2001.
Overview.
The "Californication Tour" was the band's biggest to date and most successful helping breaking them through to an even wider audience and seeing their supporting album achieve their largest world-wide sales. The anticipation for the tour was very high due to the recent return of Frusciante the previous year. The tour started in May 1999, Red Hot with a promotional tour also known as the "Stop the Hate" Tour. These concerts were only for high school students that wrote an essay on how to stop violence in schools. The world tour featured a large mixture of music from the band's entire catalog including although the band's previous album, 1995's "One Hot Minute" was only represented with Flea's song, "Pea" and nothing from that album other than that song has been performed since 1997. Frusciante at the time claimed to have never heard the album and listening to it would be like seeing your girlfriend with another man. The tour featured a heavy dose of the "Californication" album and twelve years later, all of the albums songs except for "Porcelain" have been performed live. The tour saw the band headline Woodstock '99 although a lot of controversy came following their set due to the band's performance of the Jimi Hendrix classic, "Fire" (a request made by Hendrix's sister) which some in the media said helped instigate riots in the crowd and bonfires being lit although the band at the time had no knowledge of the chaos about to breakout and claimed if they did, the song would not have been performed. 
This tour marked the last time "Backwoods", "Green Heaven", "Mommy, Where's Daddy?", "Organic Anti-Beat Box Band" and "Subterranean Homesick Blues" have been performed live.

Vadalabene Center

The Sam M. Vadalabene Center--- also known as "The VC"--- is a multi-purpose sports and recreation building on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) that features an arena with a seating capacity of just over 4,000. The facility, which opened in 1984, was named in honor of Illinois State Senator Sam Vadalabene (1914–94), who was a long-time and ardent supporter of the university. The VC is home to the SIUE Cougar basketball, volleyball, and wrestling teams. In addition to the arena, the facility also houses a swimming pool, classrooms, offices, and several activity areas. The Student Fitness Center (SFC), built in 1993, is immediately adjacent to and an integral part of the VC and contains numerous additional recreational and fitness facilities. 
On February 14, 2014, the SIU Board of Trustees approved the funding to expand the SFC weight room and to renovate the south entrance to the VC. The cost of these improvements is budgeted at $2.6 million.
In addition to SIUE athletics, the Vadalabene Center hosts the university's commencement ceremonies, trade shows, concerts, and sports events sponsored by the NCAA, the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), the Prairie State Games, and the State Games of America. The VC was host to the 1986 & '87 NCAA Division II wrestling championships which were televised on ESPN. In 2000, the VC hosted the IHSA class AA sectional semifinals and finals, where future NBA player Darius Miles led East St. Louis High School past Edwardsville High School in the championship game in front of a sold-out crowd. In 2002, rapper Nelly played a concert at the venue. In May 2010, the VC was site for a Guinness World Record--- for most people clicking a pen at one time, despite attendance of only about 100 at the event. 
The Vadalabene Center finished a $6 million renovation project in 2008 to coincide with SIUE's move to the NCAA's Division I. The facility underwent a complete overhaul, adding a new floor, dressing room, seating system (increasing seating from c.2400), plus classroom and office space. After one season playing on the new floor, rain from a heavy storm flooded and ruined the hardwood because an opening in the roof had not been properly sealed; a similar flooding event had occurred in 1990.
On November 29, 2012, the $5.4 million Lukas Athletics Annex was dedicated. Facilitated by a $4.2 million donation from the Charles S. and Mary L. Lukas Estate, the 29,100-square-foot annex houses the offices of the entire SIUE Cougars athletics program in one location for the first time. 
Jason Holmes owns the arena record for most points scored in a basketball game, with 45 on Nov. 20, 1993; the women's record is 41 points, by Amanda Hyde of IP Fort Wayne on November 26, 2013 (high Cougar score was All-American Misi Clark's 40 0n January, 20, 2000). SIUE's longest home winning streak at the Vadalabene Center is 27 by the women's basketball team during the 1988-90 seasons; the men's record is 21, 1985-87.
The largest crowd at the VC was for a men's basketball game between the then-Division II SIUE Cougars and the Division I SIU Carbondale Salukis on Jan 1, 1987, won by SIUC 84-83 in overtime. The largest post-renovation crowd at the VC was 4,157 on Jan. 21, 2012 against the then-10th ranked Murray State Racers in the first nationally televised (on ESPNU) basketball game played at the VC. 
SIUE women's basketball won its first home game against a Division I opponent January 19, 2009 over the Eastern Kentucky Colonels; on December 14, 2010, the men got their first Division I win against the Kennesaw State Owls.

Ficus americana

Ficus americana, commonly known as the West Indian laurel fig, or Jamaican cherry fig is a tree in the family Moraceae which is native to the Caribbean, Mexico in the north, through Central and South America south to southern Brazil. It is an introduced species in Florida, USA. The species is variable; the five recognised subspecies were previously placed in a large number of other species.
Description.
"Ficus americana" is a shrub or tree which grows up to 30 m (100 ft) tall.
Taxonomy.
With about 750 species, "Ficus" (Moraceae) is one of the largest angiosperm genera. (David Frodin of Chelsea Physic Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus.) "Ficus americana" is classified in the subgenus "Urostigma" (the strangler figs) and the section "Americana". Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that subgenus "Urostigma" is polyphyletic, but have strongly supported the validity of section "Americana" as a discrete group (although its exact relationship to section "Galoglychia" is unclear).
Both Aublet and Linnaeus published descriptions of this species in 1775, basing them on an illustration of Charles Plumier's published posthumously in "Plantarum americanarum, quas olim Carolus Plumierus detexit"(Amsterdam, 1755–1760). There is uncertainty was to which version was published first; since the first-published description has priority, there was confusion as to which was the proper name for the species—"F. americana" Aubl. or "F. perforata" L. To resolve this, Cornelis Berg proposed in 2003 that Aublet's name be conserved over Linnaeus', since it was more widely used. This proposal was accepted "after lengthy discussion".
Five subspecies are currently recognised: "F. americana" Aubl. subsp. "americana", "F. americana" Aubl. subsp. "andicola" (Standl.) C.C. Berg, "F. americana" Aubl. subsp. "greiffiana" (Dugand) C.C. Berg, "F. americana" Aubl. subsp. "guianensis" (Desv.) C.C. Berg, and "F. americana" Aubl. subsp. "subapiculata" (Miq.) C.C. Berg.
Reproduction.
Figs have an obligate mutualism with fig wasp (Agaonidae); figs are only pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species depends on a single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species in order to reproduce. 
Figs in section "Americana" of subgenus "Urostigma" are pollinated by wasps in the genus "Pegoscapus". "Pegoscapus clusiifolidis" was described from "Ficus clusiifolia" (a synonym of "F. americana"). Another study refers to "P. insularis" as the pollinator of "F. perforata"
Distribution.
"Ficus americana" is found throughout the Caribbean, from the Bahamas south to Trinidad and Tobago. It occurs in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. It has been introduced to Florida, USA and has escaped from cultivation.
Ecology.
Figs are sometimes considered to be potential keystone species in communities of fruit-eating animals; their asynchronous fruiting patterns may cause them to be important fruit sources when other food sources are scarce. At Tinigua National Park in Colombia "Ficus americana" was an important fruit producer during periods of fruit scarcity in two of three years. This led Colombian ecologist Pablo Stevens to consider it a potential keystone species at that site.
The interaction between figs and fig wasps is especially well-known (see section on reproduction, above). In addition to their pollinators, "Ficus" species are exploited by a group of non-pollinating chalcidoid wasps whose larvae develop in its figs. Both pollinating and non-pollinating wasps serve as hosts for parasitoid wasps. In addition to "Pegoscapus" pollinators, non-pollinating wasps belonging to the genera "Heterandrium", "Aepocerus" and "Idarnes" were found in "F. americana" figs in Brazil.

<doc id="18303999" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18303999" title="Anmchad mac Con Cherca">
Anmchad mac Con Cherca

Anmchad mac Con Cherca (died 760s) was king of Osraige, a kingdom largely situated in modern County Kilkenny and forming part of the kingdom and province of Munster in south and south-west Ireland. Anmchad was an active ruler, who mounted repeated campaigns against his eastern neighbours in Leinster.
Background.
The kingdom of Osraige, later anglicised as Ossory, was one of over 100 small kingdoms which existed in 8th century Ireland. The Osraige—their name means people of the Deer—inhabited much of modern County Kilkenny and parts of neighbouring County Laois. The most important churches were at Aghaboe (County Laois), chief church of Saint Cainnech, and at Seir Kieran (County Offaly), chief church of Saint Ciarán of Saighir.
While provided by learned men with an imposing genealogy stretching back into myth and legend, the ruling dynasty of Osraige to which Anmchad belonged appears to have come to power in the later 6th century. Colmán Mór son of Feradach appears in the life of Saint Cainnech of Aghaboe as king of Osraige, and Colmán's son Scandlán, who is mentioned in Adamnán's life of Saint Columba, appears also to have been king, dying in 643.
The succession of Osraige kings in the 7th century is obscure following the death of Scandlán and the kings who preceded Anmchad are little more than names. Anmchad's father Cú Cherca, was king and died "c".713. Cellach mac Fáelchair, killed in 735 in a battle between Cathal mac Finguine and the Leinstermen, and Forbasach mac Ailella was probably killed in 740, but how and by whom is not recorded. Anmchad is presumed to have become king after Forbasach's death.
Reign.
Following the death of Cathal mac Finguine, Munster was ruled by a series of kings who left little of note to record in the Irish annals. While Donnchad Midi of Clann Cholmáin, chief king of the Uí Néill and High King of Ireland, waged a series of campaigns against the Uí Dúnlainge rulers of Leinster, there was no response from Munster and, according to the annals, Anmchad was the most militarily active Munster king in the middle of the 8th century.
The first record of Anmchad's reign is in 742, the year in which Cathal mac Finguine died. Here the "Annals of Ulster" and the "Annals of Tigernach" state the Osraige devastated the lands of Cenél Fiachach and Delbna. These lay across the valley of the River Brosna, between Durrow Abbey and the River Shannon, in modern County Offaly. Probably following this, perhaps in 745, Anmchad defeated the Déisi Mumain, of what is now the east of County Waterford, killing their king Uargus mac Fiachrae. The following year Anmchad defeated and killed the three sons of Cumascrach, but who Cumascrach and his sons were, and the reasons why Anmchad was at war with them are now lost.
The principle target of Anmchad's later wars was Leinster, and in particular the kingdoms and peoples of southern Leinster, modern County Carlow, chief among which were Uí Bairrche Tire and Uí Cheinnselaig. It may be that the battle at Inis Snaic which Anmchad won, against whom is not stated, recorded in about 750, concerned Leinster. in 754 when the Osraige ravaged a territory to their east known as Fotharta Fea, in the eastern portion of modern Carlow. In 759, and again in 761, Anmchad fought at Belach Gabraín—the pass of Gowran—the main route between south Leinster and Osraige. Both times he defeated the Leinstermen, and in the second battle Donngal mac Laidcnén, king of Uí Cheinnselaig, was killed.
No mention of Anmchad is found in the Irish annals after the death of Donngal mac Laidcnén. In 769 a war among the Osraige is recorded in which Tóim Snáma mac Flainn, apparently now ruling Osraige, defeated the sons of Anmchad's predecessor Cellach, among whom will have been his eventual successor Dúngal mac Cellaig. Accordingly, is presumed that Anmchad died at some time between his last appearance in 761 and the coming to power of Tóim Snáma in 769 or earlier. Anmchad had at least one son who survived him, Fergal mac Anmchada, who was also king of Osraige and died in 802.

2003 expansion.
The 2003-2004 school year saw the largest single expansion in conference history. Carmi-White County and Fairfield joined from the defunct North Egypt Conference and former member Trico rejoined the conference. Cairo, Eldorado, and Hamilton County became full-time members by joining the conference for all sports.
The conference was divided into two divisions, East and West. The West Division consisted of the original five members Carterville, Christopher, Elverado, Sesser-Valier, and Zeigler-Royalton and new member Trico. The East consisted of five new members Cairo, Carmi-White County, Eldorado, Fairfield, and Hamilton County and current member Johnston City.
The conference also began to crown a champion from each division in Basketball and Volleyball. All other sports have one champion. The Diamond Duels in Basketball puts the 6 teams in each division against each other for Bragging Rights. The Duels have no outcome on Conference Champions.

With Carterville leaving the conference, the Black Diamond has dropped Wrestling as a Conference sport as only 3 schools now have wrestling programs.
Goreville High School joined the BDC for the 2011-2012 school year as a member of the BDC West Division.
Sports.
Fall.
Cross Country.
Cross Country has been a BDC sport since the 2003 expansion. The conference champion is determined by the winner of the conference tournament.
Football.
The BDC was founded as a football-only conference and a title has been awarded in all but two years, 1974 and 75, since.
Currently there are 10 BDC football programs. 7 schools compete individually and 3 pairs, Christopher-Zeigler-Royalton, Elverado-Trico, and Vienna-Goreville, compete as co-op programs.
The BDC currently has a 9-game biennial rotating schedule with all programs playing each other once. Week 5, known as rivals week, however, does not rotate and has the same match-ups each year. These match-ups are as follows.
BDC schools have also had moderate success at the state level winning two state titles, Zeigler-Royalton in 1982 and Carterville in 1996.
Golf.
Golf was added after the 2003 expansion. The title is awarded to the winner of the conference tournament at season's end.
Volleyball.
The BDC began awarding a volleyball championship during the 1994 season. Since 2003 each division has had separate champion determined by regular season conference records. Between 2003 and 2005, the BDC held a conference tournament. In 2006 the tournament was replaced with the Diamond Duels format used in basketball. The Diamond Duels pitted the East Division vs the West Division. Teams would play the team in the same conference standing from the other division. The BDC Tournament and Diamond Duels had no effect on the conference championship.
Winter.
Wrestling.
Wrestling became a conference sport after the 2003 expansion and remained until after the 2009/10 season. Only four BDC schools — Carmi-White County, Carterville, Fairfield, and Johnston City — competed for the title, and Carmi-White County won all seven. All but one of the titles were awarded to the winner of the conference tournament held on the final weekend of the regular season. the 2010 title was awarded based on conference head-to-head records due to the tournament being canceled due to weather. Wrestling was removed as a conference sport after Carterville left the conference in 2010.

Otto Kühne

Otto Kühne (b. 12 May 1893 Berlin - 8 December 1955 Brandenburg an der Havel) was a German communist militant, who led a maquis group of German antifascist fighters in the French region of Lozère in 1943 and 1944 during World War II.
A railwayman by profession, Kühne had been a communist deputy during the Reichstag fire, and had subsequently fled to France.
The maquis de Lozère.
At the beginning of the war, Kühne was interned by the Vichy regime and sent to a foreign workers' camp in Chanac in the Lozère département, where he formed a resistance group with former members of the International Brigades which was first attached to the "Combat" network in spring 1942. He was in contact with the leadership of the KPD and with the Lyon-based Free Germany Committee.
In spring 1942, Kühne was one of the founders of the Maquis de Bonnecombe. At the time he used the false name "Monsieur Schumann" and attempted to develop contacts with the Parti communiste français. This was not without difficulties; his initial attempts were met with mistrust, for fear of infiltration by Gestapo moles. Nonetheless, the German anti-fascists found strong support among the Protestant-majority population of Cévennes.
Kühne quickly became the leader of this maquis, with a reputation for solidity, intransigence and inflexibility. He became the political officer for the "Montaigne" maquis which merged three German maquis at the beginning of 1944. 
Kühne fought in the battles of 7–8 April 1944 at Saint-Étienne-Vallée-Française (Lozère), where the German maquis destroyed a patrol of the Feldgendarmerie and in an ambush against the Waffen SS on 5 June 1944 at La Rivière. He was leading a small group of about 10 maquisards when the maquis dispersed to evade an attempted encirclement by the SS reacting to these maquis operations. When the various elements of the German maquis reformed at the Plan de Fontmort, a high place of resistance of the Camisards, Kühne took command. He worked with the French "Bir Hakeim", although this was not without conflict. The GMR and the milice were tracking them in the mountains. The Wehrmacht attacked the "Bir Hakeim" group at La Borie-La Parade on Pentecost Sunday. The fighting left 61 dead; those maquisards who surrendered were executed. Kühne's group lost about ten men.
He also fought in the battles for French liberation, welcoming deserters from the Wehrmacht (particularly Armenians) in the Mende region. At that time, he connected with the FTP-MOI. His resistance name became "Robert", and he was given military responsibility within FTP-MOI for the Lozère, the Gard and the Ardèche. In June 1944, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and decorated with the Croix de Guerre with a bronze star. By the next month, he had more than 2,000 FTP fighters under his command.
Kühne seems not to have participated in the liberation of Nîmes in person, or in the parade of 4 September (unlike other German anti-fascists). He quickly returned to Lyon, where he participated in the "Free Germany Committee" (CALPO).

Thomas Kimmwood Peters

Thomas Kimmwood Peters (June 27, 1879 – 1973) was a pioneer American motion picture producer, newsreel cameraman, photographer, educator, and inventor.
Association with the motion picture industry.
Peters began his photography work in the motion picture industry around 1899, with the Pathe Freres film company of France. Later, when he left them, he continued to work throughout Europe at various companies in the motion picture industry to develop his skills. He also did photography and motion picture work at Karnak and Luxor in Egypt.
Peters was associated with the Cosmos Film Company in San Francisco, California, which later became Exactus Photo Film Corporation of Palo Alto. He became its first president and general manager when it officially started operations on August 28, 1914. The company stated that its purpose was 
In the beginning, Exactus had a list of well-respected California educators to serve on its board of directors. However, a lack of good business management and closing skills in obtaining financial backing caused its failure only two years later. There were also clashes of misunderstandings between the educators and Exactus' technicians that exacerbated the situation. By the end of 1916, Peters held an auction of the physical items held by the bankrupt company to raise money to pay off its creditors. What little stock left was turned over to the Palo Alto Film Company.
Peters kept the technical and educational value of the Exactus films at a high quality in spite of these tumultuous times. At the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, his company won two gold medals and one bronze medal for films they had produced.
Association with Oglethorpe University.
Thornwell Jacobs, originator of the Crypt of Civilization (the world's first modern time capsule located at Oglethorpe University), hired Peters to serve as the project archivist and general manager of development and construction.
One of the reasons Peters was hired was for his unique skills in photography. He used his knowledge to preserve on microfilm and film footage items to be entered in the Crypt for a 6,000-year storage. Peters recorded on film such historical figures as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. He also included President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Benito Mussolini.
Peters and his staff of student assistants worked on the Crypt project from 1937 until 1940 when it was sealed permanently. They put on cellulose acetate microfilm many historical events of the 19th and 20th centuries. The microfilm reels were placed into airtight receptacles for preservation. The staff and Peters initiated backup methods in case the acetate didn't survive. One method Peters developed was duplicate "metal film." It was as thin as paper.
Peters also worked on developing Oglethorpe University's historical photographic collections. Peters was also director of the China Air Force School at Oglethorpe University, 1945-46. He was also professor of audio-visual education at the university.
According to Oglethorpe University Peters had been the only newsreel photographer to film the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the associated fire. He was also the first to film the construction of the Panama Canal.

19th King George's Own Lancers

The 19th Lancers is an armoured regiment of the Pakistan Army. Before 1956, it was known as 19th King George V's Own Lancers, which was a regular cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1922, by the amalgamation of 18th King George's Own Lancers and 19th Lancers (Fane's Horse). On Partition of India in 1947, the regiment was allotted to Pakistan.
18th King George's Own Lancers.
The regiment was raised at Gwalior during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny in 1858, as the 2nd Regiment of Mahratta Horse. In December, it was joined by a small body of independent cavalry of Punjabi Muslims called the Tiwana Horse. In 1861, it was redesignated as the 18th Regiment of Bengal Cavalry, becoming Lancers in 1886. The regiment served in the Second Afghan War during 1879-80 and took part in the 1897 Tirah Campaign on the North West Frontier of India. During World War I, the regiment was sent to France in 1914 with the Indian Cavalry Corps and participated in the Battles of the Somme and Cambrai. In 1918, it moved to Egypt joining the 13th Cavalry Brigade and took part in General Allenby's brilliant campaign in Palestine. The regiment fought in the Battle of Megiddo and the subsequent dash towards Damascus - riding 550 miles in 38 days!
19th Lancers (Fane's Horse).
The regiment was raised as the Fane's Horse by Captain Walter Fane at Cawnpore in 1860 for service in the Second Opium War. In China, the regiment fought in several sharp actions including those at Sinho, Chan-chi-wan and Pa-le-chiao. It then took part in the capture of Chinese capital of Pekin (Beijing). In 1861, the regiment was redesignated as the 19th Regiment of Bengal Cavalry, becoming Lancers in 1864. It served in the Second Afghan War and fought in the Battle of Ahmad Khel in 1880. During World War I, the regiment served in France in the 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade and participated in the Battles of the Somme and Cambrai. In 1918, it took part in the Palestinian Campaign and fought with distinction in the Battle of Megiddo. 
19th King George V's Own Lancers.
After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. The 18th King George's Own Lancers and 19th Lancers (Fane's Horse) were merged to form the 18th/19th Cavalry. In 1923, the regiment was redesignated as the 19th King George's Own Lancers, and in 1937 as 19th King George V's Own Lancers. Their uniform was scarlet with white facings and blue overalls. The badge consisted of crossed lances with the cypher of King George V at the intersection, a crown above, and the title scroll below. The new class composition of the regiment was one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Hindu Jats.
During the Second World War, the 19th KGVO Lancers was the divisional Reconnaissance Regiment of 25th Indian Infantry Division and fought in the Third Arakan Campaign in Burma. In November 1944, the 25th Indian Division cleared the Mayu Range down to Foul Point and occupied Akyab Island. These actions included the decisive Battle of Kangaw and landings at Myebon and Ru-Ywa to intercept the retreating Japanese. The regiment was actively engaged in these battles. In May, a squadron of 19th KGVO Lancers took part in the seaborne assault landing near Rangoon, which led to the capture of the Burmese capital. In April 1945 the 25th Indian Division was withdrawn to South India to prepare for the invasion of Malaya. Although Japan surrendered in August, the operation proceeded as planned and the 25th Division along with 19th KGVO Lancers was the first formation to land in Malaya. It then proceeded to occupy the capital Kuala Lumpur and accepted the surrender of the Japanese Army.
In 1947, with the partitioning of the British Indian empire and the creation of a separate state of Pakistan, the 19th King George V's Own Lancers was transferred to the Pakistan Army. The regiment exchanged its Jat squadron with the Central India Horse for its Punjabi Mussalman squadron, and gave its Sikh squadron to Skinner's Horse in return for its Mussalman squadron.
19th Lancers.
In 1956, when Pakistan became a republic, all references to the British royalty were dropped and the regiment became simply the 19th Lancers. During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, the regiment had the unique distinction of serving in four theatres of war. Its Recce Troop served with 12 Division in Operation Grand Slam, while the rest of the regiment was deployed near Kasur as part of 1 Armoured Division. From Kasur, it was later sent to Lahore Sector and then finally to Chawinda as part of 6 Armoured Division. It was here, that 19th Lancers finally got a chance to go into action. The regiment saw heavy fighting and played an important role in blunting the Indian offensive. 
In 1993-94, the regiment was deployed in Mogadishu, Somalia, as part of United Nations Peacekeeping Forces (UNOSOM II). The regiment's performance was highly commendable and it played a key role in rescuing the American Rangers, who were trapped by Somali gunmen after the disastrous American operation on 3 and 4 October 1993.

Niddry Castle

Niddry Castle is a fourteenth-century tower house near Winchburgh, West Lothian, Scotland. It is situated near the Union Canal, and between two large oil shale "bings", or waste heap.
The tower was built around 1500 by Lord Seton. Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed here 2 May 1568, after her escape from captivity in Loch Leven Castle. George Seton, 7th Lord Seton garrisoned the castle in support of Queen Mary in 1572 during the civil war in Scotland. According to the chronicle, the "Historie of James the Sext", it was twice attacked, in April and June. In April, the Captain with forewarning repelled a night attack. He suspended heavy timber beams around the tower and released them on a party climbing scaling ladders. The garrison of Edinburgh Castle supported Niddry by attacking Merchiston Castle, which was held for James VI of Scotland, as a diversion. 
In around 1680, the castle passed to the Hope family and became part of the Hopetoun estate. The Hope family, now Marquesses of Linlithgow, hold the subsidiary title Baron Niddry. In the 1990s, Niddry Castle was restored by Peter Wright as a private residence. An extensive archaeological excavation of the castle and its surrounding barmkin area was also initiated by the proprietor. Formerly a Scheduled Monument, the tower was de-scheduled in 1996 to allow restoration, at which point it was upgraded to an `A` Listing. 
The four-storey L-plan tower has a corbelled parapet, and a turret in the angle of the "L", which was added in the 17th century. The basement is vaulted, and the hall was above, on the first floor. 
The Castle features briefly in the closing pages of Sir Walter Scott's novel The Abbot which deals with the flight of Mary Queen of Scots to England.

AnnaGrace

AnnaGrace (formerly known as Ian Van Dahl) is an electronic dance music group from Belgium. They have seen success on dance and pop charts around the world. Among their hit songs are "Castles in the Sky," "Will I?," and "Inspiration." Their third album, and debut under the AnnaGrace alias, was released on June 17, 2010.
Members.
Ian Van Dahl began in 2000 as Christophe Chantzis, Erik Vanspauwen and Martine Theeuwen, who was referred to as Marsha. Marsha was later replaced by vocalist Annemie Coenen. Later, Peter Luts and David Vervoort (more famously known as Dave McCullen) joined the group. In 2008, the group changed its name to AnnaGrace, retaining only Annemie Coenen and Peter Luts as members.
As Ian Van Dahl.
2001–2003: "Ace".
In 2001 the debut single "Castles in the Sky" was released by Ian Van Dahl. The vocals were originally recorded by Marsha; however, the producers felt that Marsha wouldn't make a good frontwoman for the act and therefore cast Cindy Mertens for the role. This decision proved to be quite controversial at the time as Cindy mimed to Marsha's vocals both in the video and during live performances. Cindy was later replaced, however, by Annemie Coenen due to her poor performance at live shows. Annemie continued to mime to Marsha's vocals before a re-recorded version appeared on the debut album, "Ace". There are two different videos for the track, both of which feature Cindy Mertens. A video with Annemie Coenen was never made. The first is the regular radio edit, which shows a selection of dancers in an underground sewer. The second video uses the Peter Luts radio edit and features clips of an instrument being played amongst clips of the original video. The song achieved great success throughout Europe, charting at #3 in the UK Singles Chart.
The second single "Will I?" was the first to officially feature Annemie Coenen as the vocalist and frontwoman. The song, again, was an international success, peaking at #5 on the UK chart.
Following the release of the first two singles, Ian Van Dahl released their debut album "Ace" to global success. The album charted at #7 in the UK Albums Chart, achieving gold status after only four weeks.
The third single to be taken from "Ace" was "Reason", which charted at #8 in the UK. "Secret Love" was chosen as the third single in a number of European countries instead. The fourth single release, "Try", reached #15 in the UK chart.
2003–2005: "Lost & Found".
Then followed the debut single from the new album "Lost & Found", called "I Can't Let You Go". This single only charted at #20 in the UK. It was then followed by the second single "Believe", which charted at #27 in the UK, resulting in the eventual cancellation of the UK release of the second album, and a hiatus on the UK chart ensued for a number of years. NuLife Recordings, Ian Van Dahl's UK record label, ceased to exist a number of months later.
"Lost & Found" also featured "Where Are You Now?" and "Inspiration", the two other single releases, which became "Billboard" Hot Dance Airplay, Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Singles Sales hits in the United States. "Inspirarion" was also released in the UK a number of years after its recording, by a small dance record label, Tubulence Records.
The last singles released under the Ian Van Dahl alias were "Movin' On", which was issued in December 2005, and "Just a Girl", which was released in July 2006. Both songs charted in Belgium and the US. Neither were released in the UK. Peter Luts decided to produce new tracks with Annemie under a new name, and AnnaGrace was born. In September 2008, A&S Productions released three further Ian Van Dahl tracks on iTunes: "Time 2 Go" (previously unreleased radio edit), "Run" (previously unreleased radio edit) and "Driving In My Car" (a track from the unreleased third Ian Van Dahl album).
As AnnaGrace.
2008-2011: "Ready to Dare".
In June 2008, the debut AnnaGrace single, "You Make Me Feel", was released in Belgium, shortly followed by a release in the United States, where it reached number one on "Billboard"'s Hot Dance Airplay chart the following October. The track was remixed for the UK and given a digital only release through the Hard2Beat label in April 2009 but failed to make any impact on the charts.
The second AnnaGrace single, "Let the Feelings Go", was released in May 2009 An exclusive preview video filmed in Los Angeles for the new track was made available on April 16. The song achieved success in the Netherlands and Belgium. The track also became their second consecutive number one single on the US Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart the following July, making them the first duo on this chart to reach number one with back to back singles. "Love Keeps Calling", the third AnnaGrace single, is now available to purchase as a digital download and physical CD. The song itself achieved moderate success in Belgium and the Netherlands. Her debut album is complete, and AnnaGrace has announced its release for June after the release of the next single. The next single, titled "Celebration", was released in Belgium on May 17, 2010. In June 2010, the debut AnnaGrace album "Ready to Dare" was released and entered in Belgium charts at number 39, climbing to a peak of 15.
"Don't Let Go" was the fifth and final single to be released from 'Ready to Dare', achieving moderate success in Belgium, reaching no.26 in the charts. The video was directed by Peter Van Eyndt and was shot in New York.
2012-present: "Fourth Studio Album (Second by AnnaGrace)".
"Ready to Fall In Love" was released 27 February 2012 as the lead single from their upcoming second album. The second single "Alive" was released on July 23, 2012. The third single "Girls Like Dancing" was released on May 28, 2013. All were released domestically in Belgium.

Dr. Chapatín

Dr. Chapatín is a fictional doctor, created and performed by the Mexican comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños.
Character.
Dr. Chapatin usually appears in his office, with his secretary and his nurse, performed by Florinda Meza. He lusts for money, caring little about his actions or words. An example of this is when he is trying to operate a patient played by Ramón Valdez: "How do you do? 200 pesos please." He is always trying to practice surgery on patients, even if they don’t need it.
Dr. Chapatín always has a paper bag—no one knows what is inside. When asked about it he answers ""queles"", meaning "que les importa", or "none of your business". When people dare suggest that he is "old", he sometimes hits them with this bag. He has a peculiar sense of humor, which sometimes can be understood as an innocent obsession for gaining money. His office appears to be a typical old doctor's office in Mexico, complete with a human skeleton, a gramophone, an old desk and an old telephone. Dr. Chapatin has been seen in hospitals and scrub-ups. He once started eating while helping to perform an operation. He has an old car which is almost totally broken down, and despite this, he still wants to use it. 
First appearance.
Originally, Dr. Chapatin appeared in "Los supergenios de la mesa cuadrada", a sketch comedy show, where he was known as "Doctor Chespirito Chapatín".
Other appearances.
He had also appeared in one of the episodes of El Chavo del 8, in which Sr. Barriga (Edgar Vivar) had fallen down and broken his feet, making him a wheelchair user. Dr. Chapatín took him to his hospital and made Sr. Barriga pay for 50 X-rays. He also appeared towards the end of El Chavo's musical video "Joven Aun".

List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario

The city of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada is home to more than 100 waterfalls and cascades, most of which are on or near the Bruce Trail as it winds through the Niagara Escarpment. Hamilton is known as ""The City of Waterfalls"" and brands itself as ""The Waterfall Capital of The World."" Ontario's internationally recognized Niagara Escarpment provides perfect geological conditions for waterfalls to occur, from Tobermory to Niagara Falls.
The most scenic waterfall in Hamilton is Webster's Falls. With its crest, it is the largest waterfall within the city. Tew's Falls is a ribbon waterfall, and is the tallest waterfall found in Hamilton. Both Webster's and Tew's are located at the Spencer Gorge / Webster's Falls Conservation Area. Albion Falls was once seriously considered as a possible source of water for Hamilton. Rocks from the Albion Falls area were used in the construction of the Royal Botanical Gardens' Rock Garden.
There used to be more waterfalls in Hamilton than exist today. Many of the waterfalls in central Hamilton slowly vanished as population and construction on Hamilton Mountain increased. As well, in the early years, James Street extended south, but was interrupted by a bog at Hunter Street which eventually (1844) was drained out and graded. Many of Hamilton's main buildings and factories in the north end are built on reclaimed or infilled land, which harmed the drainage of Hamilton and the water ecology of Hamilton Harbour.
Many of the falls in west Hamilton are accessible from the Chedoke Radial Trail. It is built on what was once the route for the Brantford and "Hamilton Electric Railway" owned by the "Cataract Power Light and Traction Company" (later Dominion Power and Transmission). The "Five Johns", (John Cameron, John Dickenson (Canadian politician), John Morison Gibson, John Moodie, Sr. and John Sutherland), formed "The Cataract Power Co. Ltd." introducing electric power to Hamilton in 1898. On August 25, 1898, power was sent twenty seven miles from "DeCew Falls", St. Catharines, using water from the old Welland Canal. New industries, such as the forerunners of the Steel Co. of Canada (Stelco) and Canadian Westinghouse, were attracted here by the cheaper, more efficient power. One time this Company controlled hydro power from Brantford to St. Catharines, including the Hamilton Street Railway and the area's radial lines. Back then the city's nickname was ""The Electric City.""
There are four waterfall types and they are designated as follows:
Some of the criteria used to define a separate Hamilton waterfall include:
The waterfall has to have a vertical drop of at least 3 metres or either as a vertical drop or a cascade, the crest width has to be at least 1 metre or wide, the waterfall must have some natural component and not be entirely man-made; If a waterfall is beside another waterfall but coming from two separate creeks or streams, then they could be considered as two separate waterfalls and the waterfall has to be located within the boundaries of the new City of Hamilton.
On January 1, 2001 the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth and its six municipalities: Hamilton, Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough, Glanbrook, and Stoney Creek. Before amalgamation, the "old" City of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods. The new amalgamated city has 490,268 people in over 200 neighbourhoods.
Waterfalls list.
A listing of the 100 waterfalls found along the Bruce Trail and the Niagara Escarpment in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Most can be easily accessed, or viewed by public lands and some are on or border private property. The list below was compiled by Joe Hollick, (with some original work done by Steve Head). The list can also be found at "The Hamilton Naturalists' Club" official web site. As of July 2008, the waterfall count for Hamilton was 100. Twenty of the waterfalls are found to be currently innaccessible because they are either on private property in which the Bruce Trail does not traverse or its too dangerous to access these waterfalls.
There are 18 waterfalls from this list, (and the expanded list below), that are either 18 metres in height or 18 metres wide. They are the ones designated in bold type.
Expanded waterfall list.
There are two primary sources used for the waterfall count in Hamilton. The first is a book put out by the Hamilton Conservation Authority called "Hamilton Waterfalls and Cascades - Research & Inventory Report (Second Edition November 1, 2007)." The second source is a list compiled by the Hamilton Naturalists' Club and can be found at their web site. The book lists 96 and the web site lists 100 waterfalls. When you cross-reference the two you end up getting five extra waterfalls from the book that are not listed at the web site. This then brings the grand total of Hamilton waterfalls up to 105. These extra five waterfalls are listed below:
Note: Both Lower and Middle Quarry Cascades are based in Burlington right near the Hamilton/ Burlington city boundary line. Their watersource, Grindstone Creek and Upper Quarry Cascade are both based in Hamilton. As well, Lower and Snake Falls are based in Burlington but the property there is owned by the City of Hamilton.
<br>* Lower Quarry Cascade (P)
<br>* Lower Snake Falls
<br>* Middle Quarry Cascade (P)
<br>* Snake Falls
<br>* Vinemount East Falls (P-CN)
<br>
Thirty four of these 105 waterfalls lie on private property. 11 are owned by Canadian National Railway (CN) and 23 are by individual property owners. In some cases waterfalls found on private properties can still be accessed with permission from the owners. With some of the other waterfalls found on private properties they are off limits entirely.
Undiscovered waterfalls.
There are actually more waterfalls than is what listed here. There are a lot of areas on the escarpment that are impossible or dangerous to get to which makes the finding and recording even more of a challenge.

Utah State Route 44

State Route 44 (SR-44) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah that runs from US-191 at Greendale Junction, southwest of Dutch John, to SR-43 in Manila. The route spans as it straddles the southern and western border of the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, and, along with US-191 is part of the Flaming Gorge-Uintas Scenic Byway.
The highway was established in 1927, originally going from Manila to Greendale Junction and continuing south to Vernal. However, in 1981, the portion from Vernal to Greendale Junction was truncated in order to designate that road a part of US-191.
Route description.
The route begins at the junction of US-191 on the southern boundary of the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, southwest of Dutch John. From there, the route heads west, continuing to straddle the southern boundary of Flaming Gorge. The highway turns northwest, now fully entering the National Recreation Area. Past Sheep Creek Loop Road, the route begins a more unpredictable path with many twists and turns, though remaining in a general northwest direction. The route continues north, exits Flaming Gorge, and continues north for before terminating at SR-43 in Manila.
History.
The road from SR-6 (US-40) in Vernal north to SR-43 in Manila, where one could continue to Wyoming, was added to the state highway system in about 1918 as a forest highway project, completed in 1926, and numbered SR-44 in 1927. Two major realignments through the Ashley National Forest were made in 1966 and 1971, the first moving SR-44 to the northeast between a point south of Carter Creek and near Summit Springs, and the second moving it east between a point east of Summit Springs and Sheep Creek Gap. (The east–west road past Summit Springs was only a state highway between 1966 and 1971.) The final change was in 1981, when the part of SR-44 south of Greendale Junction was renumbered as part of US-191.

Morning Star Lake is a lake in the central part of the U.S. state of Nebraska. Off the Platte River just outside of Clarks, the lake is part of a complex of five private, manmade lakes called "Summerwood". The lakes were built as a result of the sand and gravel mining efforts of Overland Sand and Gravel. The lakes are spring fed, sand bottom lakes with clear, clean water. Summerwood is a gated community and Morning Star Lake has approximately 40 houses on it.
The lake's Fourth of July celebration includes a boat parade, sand volleyball, a scavenger hunt, sand castle contests and a community cookout, ending with a fireworks display.

<doc id="18304412" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18304412" title="Fiber optic sensor">
Fiber optic sensor

A fiber optic sensor is a sensor that uses optical fiber either as the sensing element ("intrinsic sensors"), or as a means of relaying signals from a remote sensor to the electronics that process the signals ("extrinsic sensors"). Fibers have many uses in remote sensing. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, or because no electrical power is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be multiplexed along the length of a fiber by using light wavelength shift for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain reflectometer and wavelength shift can be calculated using an instrument implementing optical frequency domain reflectometry.
Fiber optic sensors are also immune to electromagnetic interference, and do not conduct electricity so they can be used in places where there is high voltage electricity or inflammable material such as jet fuel. Fiber optic sensors can be designed to withstand high temperatures as well.
Intrinsic sensors.
Optical fibers can be used as sensors to measure strain,temperature, pressure and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the quantity to be measured modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of intrinsic fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over very large distances.
Temperature can be measured by using a fiber that has evanescent loss that varies with temperature, or by analyzing the Raman scattering of the optical fiber. Electrical voltage can be sensed by nonlinear optical effects in specially-doped fiber, which alter the polarization of light as a function of voltage or electric field. Angle measurement sensors can be based on the Sagnac effect.
Special fibers like long-period fiber grating (LPG) optical fibers can be used for direction recognition
. Photonics Research Group of Aston University in UK has some publications on vectorial bend sensor applications.
Optical fibers are used as hydrophones for seismic and sonar applications. Hydrophone systems with more than one hundred sensors per fiber cable have been developed. Hydrophone sensor systems are used by the oil industry as well as a few countries' navies. Both bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays and towed streamer systems are in use. The German company Sennheiser developed a laser microphone for use with optical fibers.
A fiber optic microphone and fiber-optic based headphone are useful in areas with strong electrical or magnetic fields, such as communication amongst the team of people working on a patient inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine during MRI-guided surgery.
Optical fiber sensors for temperature and pressure have been developed for downhole measurement in oil wells. The fiber optic sensor is well suited for this environment as it functions at temperatures too high for semiconductor sensors (distributed temperature sensing).
Optical fibers can be made into interferometric sensors such as fiber optic gyroscopes, which are used in the Boeing 767 and in some car models (for navigation purposes). They are also used to make hydrogen sensors.
Fiber-optic sensors have been developed to measure co-located temperature and strain simultaneously with very high accuracy using fiber Bragg gratings. This is particularly useful when acquiring information from small complex structures. Brillouin scattering effects can be used to detect strain and temperature over larger distances (20–30 kilometers).
Other examples.
A fiber-optic AC/DC voltage sensor in the middle and high voltage range (100–2000 V) can be created by inducing measurable amounts of Kerr nonlinearity in single mode optical fiber by exposing a calculated length of fiber to the external electric field. The measurement technique is based on polarimetric detection and high accuracy is achieved in a hostile industrial environment.
High frequency (5 MHz–1 GHz) electromagnetic fields can be detected by induced nonlinear effects in fiber with a suitable structure. The fiber used is designed such that the Faraday and Kerr effects cause considerable phase change in the presence of the external field. With appropriate sensor design, this type of fiber can be used to measure different electrical and magnetic quantities and different internal parameters of fiber material.
Electrical power can be measured in a fiber by using a structured bulk fiber ampere sensor coupled with proper signal processing in a polarimetric detection scheme. Experiments have been carried out in support of the technique.
Fiber-optic sensors are used in electrical switchgear to transmit light from an electrical arc flash to a digital protective relay to enable fast tripping of a breaker to reduce the energy in the arc blast.
Extrinsic sensors.
Extrinsic fiber optic sensors use an optical fiber cable, normally a multimode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor, or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is their ability to reach places which are otherwise inaccessible. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer located outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors can also be used in the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible.
Extrinsic fiber optic sensors provide excellent protection of measurement signals against noise corruption. Unfortunately, many conventional sensors produce electrical output which must be converted into an optical signal for use with fiber. For example, in the case of a platinum resistance thermometer, the temperature changes are translated into resistance changes. The PRT must therefore have an electrical power supply. The modulated voltage level at the output of the PRT can then be injected into the optical fiber via the usual type of transmitter. This complicates the measurement process and means that low-voltage power cables must be routed to the transducer.
Extrinsic sensors are used to measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting.

Gyula Andrássy High School ("Andrássy Gyula Gimnázium és Kollégium"), formerly Rózsa Ferenc Gimnázium or "Rózsa" for short, is a high school (grammar school) in Békéscsaba, Hungary. The school is the oldest in the city and one of the most renowned in Békés county.
History.
The school was founded by the Lutheran church in 1855, as "Algimnázium." In 1895 the school was upgraded to "Főgimnázium" and got the name "Rudolf Főgimnázium." After the Communist takeover (1948) the school has been taken into state property and took the name of Ferenc Rózsa. Rózsa was a member of the then-illegal Communist Party of Hungary between the two World Wars, criticised the political system and died in prison under unclear circumstances. During the Communist era he was regarded as a martyr.
Present days.
The school moved into its current building in 1994. Rózsa Gimnázium holds steadily its position among the best schools in the county, in 2004 its pupils received 11 awards on different high school contests. Based on school contest results Rózsa Gimnázium was always among the best 20 schools of Hungary between 1986 and 2006. The local government renamed the school in 2008 as Andrássy Gyula Gimnázium és Kollégium. Andrássy was a prime minister of Kingdom of Hungary between 1867–1871, and the foreign minister of Austria-Hungary between 1871-1879.

Yehiel Tzagai

Yehiel Tzagai (, born 27 January 1983) is an Israeli footballer of Ethiopian descent.
Biography.
Tzagai was born in the Beta Israel community in Ethiopia and his family immigrated to Israel in 1991 during the Operation Solomon.
Tzagai grew up through the ranks at Beitar Avraham Be'er Sheva but as the club has collapsed in 2002, he signed at another club in Beersheba - Hapoel Be'er Sheva where he was loaned until 2004 to F.C. Ashdod and Hakoah Ramat Gan.
In 2004 Tzagai returned to Hapoel Be'er Sheva and played there for three seasons in the second league, where we was considered one of the most talented players in the whole league. During the 2006-07 season, Tzagai and two other Be'er Sheva players admitted to receiving bribes to throw a match against Hapoel Ra'anana.

Nelaton's line

In anatomy, the Nelaton's Line (also known as the Roser-Nélaton line) is a theoretical line, in the moderately flexed hip, drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tuberosity of the ischium.
It was named for German surgeon and ophthalmologist Wilhelm Roser and French surgeon Auguste Nélaton.
Clinical significance.
Normally the greater trochanter of the femur lies in this line, but in cases of iliac joint dislocation of the hip or fracture of the neck of the femur the trochanter is felt above the line.
Though the line can be of help for diagnosis of fractures, its practical value is disputed.

<doc id="18304536" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18304536" title="South Park Lofts">
South Park Lofts

South Park Lofts, located in downtown Los Angeles, was built in 1924 as an eight-story parking garage. It was one of America's first parking structures, and is one of the few parking garages listed in the National Register of Historic Places, having received the distinction in 2004. The building has been converted to lofts and is now known as "South Park Lofts." As "Building at 816 Grand Avenue", it is one of more than ten buildings designed by Claud Beelman listed on the National Register.
One of L.A.'s first parking garages.
As the automobile took on a more prominent role in Los Angeles, traffic and parking became major problems for downtown businesses. In 1923, the Downtown Business Men's Association and Mayor George Cryer began advocating the construction of parking structures. Businessman Ken Stoakes took up the challenge and built an eight-story, parking garage on Grand Avenue. Stoakes hired one of the city's most prominent architects, Claud Beelman. Beelman and Stoakes sought to create a structure that had continuity with the office buildings, hotels and department stores that lined Grand Avenue. Accordingly, Beelman designed a Beaux Arts edifice with windows and decorative details typical of other commercial buildings of the 1920s. 
Stoakes' garage opened to much fanfare in 1924. Stoakes promoted the safety and security of his "fireproof garage." In an interview with the "Los Angeles Times" during the 1925 holiday shopping season, Stoakes said: "Parking along the curb downtown is bad enough at best. With the frantic attempt of thousands of Christmas shoppers to squeeze in the already available jammed parking space, it is almost suicidal to the appearance of any respectable-looking car."
Through the 1920s and 1930s, the garage was used by Bullock's department store, with uniformed attendants picking up and dropping off shoppers' cars. Shoppers could park two hours for free at Stoakes' structure with a $1 purchase at Bullocks.
Conversion to other uses.
The structure was purchased by Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. in 1950. Used initially for employee parking, it was later converted to use for storage and offices. The building subsequently went through several changes of ownership and was used for many years as an office building. 
The building was acquired by Martin Building Co. in 2002 and converted into 49 upscale lofts at a cost of $10 million. The key to the adaptive use of the building was in its unusually narrow lot and design. Many older parking structures were built with ramps and sloped floors. Stoakes' garage, on the other hand, was situated on a narrow lot that left no room for ramps. Accordingly, Beelman designed the garage around a huge freight elevator that could lift two cars at once. When the building became lofts, the rooftop housing for the elevator motor was converted into a small gymnasium for residents. The building also has concierge service and an elaborate roof-top garden with a hot tub and grilling area with limited hours imposed as punishment upon tenants. The new residents have complained that the converted parking garage has "too little parking." MWest / Polaris, the property management company that took over in 2013, has severely neglected the building and made written threats to tenants for asking questions. Some tenants think the company is trying to get rid of them in order to raze the building and construct a bigger property.
Historic designation.
In August 2004, the California Historic Resources Commission granted historic landmark status to the building. Eight months later, it was recognized by the United States Department of the Interior as "one of America's first parking structures to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places." It is one of more than ten buildings designed by Claud Beelman listed on the National Register.

Construction on the center began in 1980, and it opened on December 10, 1982. At , it was the fourth largest facility in the United States at the time. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, numerous larger and more modern facilities were constructed around the country, and by 1997 the Washington Convention Center had become the 30th largest facility.
After being replaced by the new Walter E. Washington Convention Center, the old convention center was imploded at approximately 7:30 a.m. on December 18, 2004. Until 2011, the site was a municipal parking lot that was also used as the intercity bus terminal for Megabus and BoltBus. The site was also used for special events such as Cirque Du Soleil and the home of the Washington Kastles Stadium. However, construction of a new $950 million complex called CityCenterDC on the site began in March 2011.

<doc id="18304700" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18304700" title="Impossiball">
Impossiball

The Impossiball is a rounded icosahedral puzzle similar to the Rubik's Cube. It has a total of 20 movable pieces to rearrange, same as the Rubik's Cube, but all of the Impossiball's pieces are corners, like the Pocket Cube.
History.
William O. Gustafson applied for a patent for the Impossiball design in 1981 and it was issued in 1984. Uwe Mèffert eventually bought the rights to some of the patents and continues to sell it in his puzzle shop under the Impossiball moniker.
Description.
The Impossiball is made in the shape of an icosahedron that has been rounded out to a sphere, and has 20 pieces, all of them corners. The puzzle has twelve circles located at the vertices of the icosahedron, and opposite circles are the same color. Because of the rounded shape of the puzzle, the pieces move up and down as they are rotated. It is also possible to remove one piece, turning the puzzle into a spherical version of the 15 puzzle.
The purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore it to its original state of having one color per circle. This puzzle is equivalent to solving just the corners of a Megaminx. The original Impossiball had the same colors as the Rubik's Cube: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and white. Meffert currently produces two versions, one with six colors and one with twelve. The six-color version (pictured) uses pink, two shades of orange, yellow, green and blue. All the pieces are still distinguishable, however, because the two pieces with the same three colors are mirror images of each other. The twelve-color version has red, pink, orange, yellow, two shades of green, three shades of blue, purple, brown and white.
Solutions.
In spite of its daunting appearance and greater number of possible positions, the Impossiball is not much more difficult than the standard 2×2×2 Pocket Cube. This is because it is not a deep-cut puzzle; it only has pentagonal face layers which are similar in structure to the square face layers of the cube. There are no pieces that do not have a counterpart on the cube. Many of the techniques employed in the solution of the Pocket Cube can also be adapted for the Impossiball.
Number of combinations.
There are 20!/2 ways to arrange the pieces, since there is no way to create odd permutations without tampering with the puzzle. There are 319 ways to orient the pieces, since the orientation of the last depends on that of the preceding ones. Since the Impossiball has no fixed face centers, this result is divided by 60. There are 60 possible positions and orientations of the first corner, but all are equivalent because of the lack of face centers.
The entire number is 23 563 902 142 421 896 679 424 000 (roughly 23.6 septillion on the short scale or 23.6 quadrillion on the long scale).

El Chanfle

El Chanfle is a movie created by Roberto Gómez Bolaños, also known as Chespirito. It was filmed in Mexico in 1978. It is classified as comedy movie.
Plot.
El Chanfle (Roberto Gomez Bolaños) is a waterboy at Club América who helps the coach, Moncho Reyes (Ramón Valdés) during soccer games, by giving the players water and helping them with shoes and everything else they need during the game. Constantly he daydreams during the games, causing him to accidentally kick the coach during penalty shots.
He is married to Tere (Florinda Meza), a typical housewife, passionate about soccer, mainly because of Chanfle's job.
Despite having been married for 10 years, they are not precisely in the best financial situation, to the point in which they could not afford fixing an old sofa, which falls to the back when someone seats on it.
One day, Tere was talking to Chanfle about saving, and she said (talking about saving money): "You saw what I bought at the supermarket?". Then Tere showed Chanfle a pair of new shoes.
So Chanfle said: "That isn't saving, that is spending!". After that Tere said: "Nope, it's saving, because I bought them in the supermarket and nobody charged me for them", making Chanfle realize that his wife took a pair of shoes without paying them, so he (as a recurring gag to show him as a straight guy) rolled up two imaginary sleevs and returned to the store with Tere.
There, he paid 299 pesos, in order to pay for the shoes, to a nice lady cashier store clerk (Angelines Fernández), who told them that already their bosses would discount that amount from her salary, therefore he did not have to pay for the shoes.
Tere and Chanfle, who had been married for 10 years, had never had children, and they wanted to, since Tere was 28 years old and Chanfle was 35.
So, Chanfle's boss and president of the club, Mr. Matute (Ruben Aguirre) knew that after Chanfle asked him a raise. Then, Mr. Matute told Dr. Nájera (Edgar Vivar), who was the physician at the soccer team, about Chan fle's and Tere's predicament. After Tere and Chanfle talked with Dr. Nájera, the Doctor told them that he knew some people at some lab, so Chanfle and his wife went there for some lab tests. Incidentally, Dr. Nájera sat on the coach and, due to his overweight figure, he brokes the floor making him fall down to Dr. Chapatin's apartment, some floors behind.
After that, Tere brought the results to Dr. Nájera, who told her she was going to have a baby. She was nervous and very happy at the same time, then she gave the news to her husband, who also was very happy, to the point of jumping and dancing at the club's patio.
But Tere and Chanfle were in the same need of money they had before. So they decided to sell an old gun, formerly belonging to Tere's father. Chanfle and Tere went down the street and tried to sell the pistol to a drunk man named Paco (Raul "Chato" Padilla), who thought that they were trying to assault him, due to Chanfle showing the gun as he was pointing him, and proceeded to give some things from his house to Chanfle (and old lamp, a guitar, etc.). Paco then shouted at a policeman that Tere and Chanfle were trying to assault him, so they began to run, hence they had no success selling the pistol.
Another day, Chanfle and his wife Tere were shopping at the store where the nice clerk was working at. So, it is later discovered that Paco, the drunk man, was the husband of this nice cashier. Paco bumps Chanfle at the parking lot of the store, and because Paco was angry because he thought Chanfle was robbing him the other time they had met, he threw Chanfle a watermelon and chased him all the way to a city park. When Chanfle got back to the parking lot, Tere wanted to drive home herself and was impatient about it, causing her to become less careful with her driving and to crash with another car.
Then, because Chanfle was highly ethical, he was willing to pay for the damage to the car's owner. So he went to the clerk and asked her who was the owner of the car with the license plates: 631-ACJ. When the clerk heard that she sadly said: "Only yesterday, I had my car at the mechanic".
Another worry for Chanfle and Tere: they didn't have money for paying to the lady's car damage, nor to repair their old sofa. This problem was solved when Tere went once again to the supermarket and gave the nice clerk 100 pesos for the car's repair. Then, the clerk confessed that her husband wanted to buy a gun. When Tere heard this, she promptly and very happily said: "I'll sell you one!!!". That evening, she sold the gun to the supermarket clerk and now Tere was debt-free.
So the months go by, and Tere was going to give birth. Club America is expected to play the championship game against Atletico Español and Tere is expecting to have her child after the game, so she went to the soccer stadium with Diana (Maria Antonieta de las Nieves), the soccer club's secretary, who was in love with one of the most popular players at the team, Valentino (Carlos Villagrán). Then Tere met again with the clerk and her husband Paco, who said, stranged: "Have we met before??", during the game, Tere began to give birth so, with the help of Tere and the nice clerk she is taken to the infirmary to be attended by Dr. Najera.
At the same time, Valentino cheated to provoke a penalty kick which helped América get a goal. In the second half, Chanfle learns that his wife was about to give birth, at the same time that an Atletico defender puts Valentino down to sentence another penalty kick. At that moment, Chanfle daydreamed about his son to be, dreaming that the boy became a famous player for America (with the looks of Chanfle) and is able to be a forward for his team scoring an irrational number of goals for America in that game. But he wakes up after kicking coach Don Moncho again when daydreaming about his son shooting a penalty kick. After this he is kicked off the game intentionally in order to see his wife.
Chanfle bumped with Paco again, who had the gun already on his hands, and was going to kill Chanfle. The wild run which ensued, caused them to enter the stadium again and both end causing the game to be suspended. While Tere is suffering with the birth pain at the same time as Valentino is suffering due to the lesion he got in game. When Valentino sees Tere he asked her what is going on, and she tell him "We'll have a baby", surprised (as long as Valentino was hit in his ribs and doing his trademark Quico face) he began to scream stronger.
Paco chased Chanfle to the medical office, where Tere was giving birth to a girl, to Chanfle's dismay. So, the clerk explained to her husband that Chanfle was that honest man who paid his wife's soes and sold her the pistol. Paco still thought that Chanfle was trying to rob him, until Tere said that her husband's real purpose was selling the gun when Paco was drunk. Tere then said that Paco couldn't kill Chanfle because the pistol was broken. Then Chanfle, hearing this, asked Paco: "How much do I owe you?".
At the end, Mr. Matute announced that Chanfle wasn't going to be in his current job, instead he'll be the Children's team coach. At the time when Chanfle was going to sign his contract, he accidentally broke all the office furniture and also a "The End" glass sign.
Reception.
El Chanfle was premiered in Mexico and Latin America in late 1978 and 1979. The movie had mixed reviews, but it was a huge hit, due to the popularity of Chespirito at that time. The movie was so successful that even rivalized in the box office with "Superman, the Movie" on the Latinamerican cinemas. The film is also highly regarded by Chespirito's fans, because it showcase the first and only time that the entire cast was together in one production. After the movie was premiered, Carlos Villagran left the group due to the constant clash with Gomez Bolaños. Ramón Valdez left the group a few months later, and did a brief comeback in 1981. Raul "El Chato" Padilla was a guest member of the group for almost a year, and became a permanent member of the cast from 1981 until his death in 1994.
A sequel of El Chanfle (El Chanfle 2 or El Chanfle Segundo) was premiered in 1982. It was successful at the box office but not at the level of the first film.

Water supply and sanitation in Iran

"This article reflects the situation as of November 2008, with minor updates after that date. Please feel free to update the article further."
Water supply and sanitation in Iran has witnessed some important improvements, especially in terms of increased access to urban water supply, while important challenges remain, particularly concerning sanitation and service provision in rural areas.
Institutionally, the Ministry of Energy is in charge of policy and provincial companies are in charge of service provision.
Access.
The sector is characterized by a wide discrepancy in coverage of water and sewerage services, as well as between urban and rural areas. The Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for water supply and sanitation of the WHO and UNICEF, which monitors access figures based on national surveys and censuses, estimated access in Iran from the 1996 census and a 1997 cluster survey. According its esimates, access to an improved source of water supply was 99% in urban areas where two thirds of Iranians live. It was 84% in rural areas (69% house connections). Access to sewerage in urban areas was estimated at 19%. There is no estimate for access to adequate sanitation (including septic tanks and improved latrines).
Water resources.
Climate Rainfall in Iran is highly seasonal, with a rainy season between October and March, leaving the land parched for the remainder of the year. Immense seasonal variations in flow characterize Iran's rivers. For example, the Karun River in Khuzestan carries water during periods of maximum flow that is ten times the amount borne in dry periods. In numerous localities, there may be no precipitation until sudden storms, accompanied by heavy rains, dump almost the entire year's rainfall in a few days. Water shortages are compounded by the unequal distribution of water. Near the Caspian Sea, rainfall averages about 1,280 mm per year, but in the Central Plateau and in the lowlands to the south it seldom exceeds 100 mm.
Water availability. Internal renewable water resources are estimated at 128.5 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year (average for 1977-2001). Surface runoff represents a total of 97.3 BCM/year, of which 5.4 BCM/year comes from drainage of the aquifers and thus needs to be subtracted from the total. Groundwater recharge is estimated at about 49.3 BCM/year, of which 12.7 BCM/year is obtained from infiltration in the river bed and also needs to be subtracted. Iran receives 6.7 BCM/year of surface water from Pakistan and some water from Afghanistan through the Helmand River. The flow of the Arax river, at the border with Azerbaijan, is estimated at 4.6 BCM/year. The surface runoff to the sea and to other countries is estimated at 55.9 BCM/year. Per capita water availability in the pre-Islamic Revolution era was about 4,500 cubic meters. But, in 2009 this figure was less than 2,000 cubic meters.
Dams. There are 42 large dams under operation in Iran with a combined storage capacity of 33 BCM/year. These dams lose about 200 million cubic meters of storage capacity every year due to sedimentation (0.5-0.75% of their storage capacity). Most dams are multi-purpose dams for hydropower, irrigation, flood control and - in some cases - drinking water supply.
Water use. The total water withdrawal was estimated at about 70 BCM in 1993, rising to 93 BCM in 2004, of which 92% was used for agricultural purposes, 6% for domestic use and 2% for industrial use. Although this is equal to 51% of the actual available renewable water resources, annual abstraction from aquifers (57 BCM in 1993, 53 BCM in 2004) is already more than the estimated safe yield (46 BCM). Of the 4.3 BCM/year in 1993 (6.2 in 2004) used for domestic purposes, 61% is supplied from surface water and 39% from groundwater. For example, Greater Tehran with its population of more than 13 million is supplied by surface water from the Lar dam on the Lar River in the Northeast of the city, the Latyan dam on the Jajrood River in the North, the Karaj River in the Northwest, as well as by groundwater in the vicinity of the city. Provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran and Isfahan have the highest efficiency of irrigation with 54, 52 and 42 percents respectively, and Khuzestan province has the lowest irrigation efficiency with 38 percent. Tap water consumption in the country is 70% over and above the global average. 16 BCM of water was used for power generation in 1999 from over 400 power plants producing 61,000 MW of electricity.
Infrastructure. Most drinking water in Iran is supplied through modern infrastructure, such as dams, reservoirs, long-distance transmission pipelines - some of which are more than 300 km long - and deep wells. An estimated 60,000 traditional Karez (کاریز) systems in the plateau regions of Iran in Yazd, Khorasan and Kerman - are still in use today for irrigation and drinking water supply in rural areas and small towns. The oldest and largest known Karez is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which after 2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers. It is estimated that there are as many as 500,000 deep and shallow wells in the country.
Water pollution is caused by industrial and municipal wastewater, as well as by agriculture. Concerning municipal wastewater, the bulk of collected sewage is discharged untreated and constitutes a major source of pollution to groundwater and a risk to public health. In a number of cities without sanitary sewerage, households discharge their sewage through open rainwater drains.
History and recent developments.
Up to 1990 the water and sanitation sector was highly decentralized. Most water and wastewater service provision was the responsibility of municipalities and provinces. This was changed through a fundamental sector reform in 1990 with the ratification of the Provincial Water and Wastewater Companies Law of September 1990.
In September 2003 the Government of Iran and the World Bank agreed on a sector strategy with the targets for improved cost recovery and collection and increased efficiency. It is not clear what were the baseline data in 2003 and to what extent progress has been made to reach these targets.
In November 2008 the government announced that it has approved the construction of 177 dams nationwide. Dams in Iran serve primarily for hydropower generation, irrigation and flood control. However, one of the projects will provide drinking water and water for industrial use to the cities of Qom, Golpaygan, Delijan, Saveh, Khomein and Nimvar in the central provinces of Qom, Isfahan and Markazi.
In April 2012, the government launched a project to transfer Caspian Sea water to the central regions of Iran, bringing about 200 million cubic meters (7,062 cubic feet) of water per year.
Achievements and challenges.
Since the 1980s access to urban water supply has increased from 75.5% to 98%. According to one Iranian observer, the water quantity supplied has increased and the quality has improved. He concludes that the reform has been “very successful” and is “an example of best practice” that should “be proposed to other countries.
However, a number of challenges remain. According to the World Bank, the sector is affected by “low water use efficiency in urban and rural uses; limited participation by stakeholders in development planning and management; large needs for rehabilitation and development of hydraulic infrastructure for sustainable water usage; problems of pollution caused by the discharge of untreated wastewater into public waterways and aquifers; and weak institutions involved in the sector and limited coordination among stakeholders.” Still according to the World Bank it is also characterized by “poor performance of water supply and on-site wastewater disposal facilities, causing increasing risk for ground and surface water pollution and health and environmental risks resulting from the discharge and re-use of untreated effluent for irrigation; limited technical, institutional and financial capacity of water and wastewater companies; a lack of clarity of institutional responsibilities of sector entities; and non transparent and inadequate tariff structures and levels.”
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation.
Policy.
The Ministry of Energy, through its Deputy Ministry for Urban and Rural Water and Wastewater Management, is in charge of setting sector policies. The Deputy Ministry of Water Affairs in the same Ministry is in charge of water resources management, together with eleven Regional Water Boards. The Environmental Protection Organization is in charge of water pollution control. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education is responsible for setting drinking water quality standards, as well as monitoring and enforcing them. 
The National Water and Wastewater Engineering Company (NWWEC) provides oversight and assistance to service providers in areas such as investment planning, human resources development, and in the establishment of standardized systems and procedures. The National Economic Council sets tariff policy for the whole country, with some differentiation across regions.
Service provision.
In 2008 sixty companies were responsible for the provision of water and wastewater services. Evenly spread over Iran’s thirty provinces, each province has one urban and one rural water and wastewater company (WWC). The 60 companies had 38,000 employees. Only Tehran has two separate companies for water and sewerage. In all other provinces, water and sanitation services are provided together. The regional water boards provide bulk raw water through transmission pipelines to the water and wastewater companies, which treat and distribute it.
The state-owned WWCs are able to manage their day-to-day operations with a measure of autonomy where Managing Directors can make most decisions on operations and staffing within the limits of the centrally authorized staffing levels and with some flexibility to provide extra compensation to well performing employees. However, the WWCs do not control their own investment programs and, therefore, have limited scope to improve investment and operating efficiency and the level and quality of service. Moreover the WWCs have to follow an organizational model developed by the NWWEC and cannot select a model that would be more appropriate for their particular situation.
Financial aspects.
Investment.
Until 2005, the national budget for the water sector stood at 1,400 billion rials while it has reached 3,500 billion rials (US$ 350 million using the official exchange rate) in 2008. This budget apparently includes multi-purpose dam and irrigation as well as water supply and sanitation. The government said in 2011 that investment needs stood at US$150 billion over the next 15 years, 20% of which should be financed by the private sector.
Cost recovery.
On average, the service providers do not recover operation and maintenance costs due to low tariffs and low bill collection. For example, the Provincial Water and Sewerage Companies for Ahwaz and Shiraz have been incurring significant net losses at least prior to 2004. The financial performance of the companies is further aggravated by high water losses of 38% in 2002/03 in Ahwaz and about 30% in Shiraz. Of the water that has been billed, only about 73% was collected in 2002/03 in Ahwaz, while it was higher in Shiraz.
Tariffs.
The current urban tariff system is based on a fixed fee that depends on the size of the connection pipe and on the type of customer (household or other types), and on a volumetric charge based on increasing block-tariffs. The fixed fee, or the subscription fee, was about 2,000 Rials in 2004 (25 US cents) for most domestic customers while the structure of variable tariffs is based on a complex formula. The formula is the same for all companies and there is no volumetric charge if consumption falls below 5 cubic meter per month. Above this minimum, the tariff increases with the level of consumption and generally varies across companies. The average volumetric tariff for the country stood at about 6 US cents in 2002. It varied from 2 cents for monthly consumption below 20 cubic meter, to about 4.5 cents and 12.5 cents respectively for 20-40 and for more than 40 cubic meter of monthly consumption.
According to the World Bank, the rate structure is needlessly complex for both volumetric rates and connection fees. Volumetric tariffs are based on complex formulas that differ across consumption brackets and water and wastewater companies. Because of this complexity the tariff structure lacks transparency. Moreover, the structure is such that rates increase by more than threefold when consumption rises from 20 cubic meter or less to slightly higher volumes. Regarding sewage bills they are currently levied and collected only in neighborhoods where a network exists and are a percentage of water bills (70%).
Average connection fees are about US$310 for the whole country and the minimum fee is
approximately equal to US$l50. With a few exceptions, the connection fee for wastewater is the same as that for water. These fees have been regularly increased between 1999 and 2003, at the rate of 10% annually with the exception of the year 2000 in which the fee was increased by 15%. In addition to connection fees, the water and wastewater companies charge the customer the full cost for house connection.
External cooperation.
The main external partner of the Iranian water and sanitation sector during the first decade of the 21st century was the World Bank. Today the main external partners are the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations and NGOs.
Islamic Development Bank.
In October 2012 the Islamic Development Bank approved a USD710 million loan for wastewater treatment in rural areas and in the watersheds upstream of dams.
United Nations.
UNESCO-IHE in Delft, The Netherlands, together with the Power and Water University of Technology (Shahid Abbaspour) in Iran, will train 2,100 Iranian professionals in water and wastewater technologies, planning and management. The training will consist of 59 courses to take place in 2008 and the first half of 2009. In addition, 20 study tours to European water and wastewater companies for senior managerial, financial and technical staff will be organised.
Foreign Non-governmental Organizations.
Unlike other lower and middle-income countries, Iran hosts few private international non-governmental organizations that pursue environmental or social aims. Despite the difficult operating environment and friction with ruling bodies, the Iranian Government has moved to encourage an increased participation by foreign NGOs. As a result some organizations that closed operations have resumed their activities, and new startup organizations, including those that work in the areas of water and sanitation, have initiated projects in Iran. One such organization, Healing For Iran, recently launched a program to improve rural access to water and investigate the causes of water contamination in disadvantaged populations.
World Bank.
The World Bank began its engagement in water and sanitation in the Islamic Republic of Iran with the approval of the Tehran Sewerage Project in 2000, followed by the approval of two other projects in 2004 and 2005. Since then the World Bank has not approved any new projects in Iran. In 2010 it had only one active project in the Iranian water and sanitation sector:The Northern Cities Water Supply and Sanitation Project, approved in 2005 and supported by a US$ 224m loan, aims to enhance the quality of life in the four northern cities of Rasht and Anzali in Gilan Province, as well as Sari and Babol in Mazandaran Province. It aims to do so by improving the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of the two Provincial Water and Wastewater Companies (WWCs). The project will finance the extension and improvement of water distribution systems including metering, sanitary sewers, and a wastewater treatment plant (in Sari). It will also provide consultant services for institutional development and an environmental management plan.
The Ahvaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project, supported by a US$ 279m loan approved in 2004 and closed in 2009, aimed to improve access to satisfactory water supply and significantly increasing coverage o f sanitation services; and improve environmental, hygiene and health conditions, as well as promoting reuse of treated effluents. It also aimed to strengthen and develop the capacity of Ahvaz and Shiraz Water and Wastewater Companies, and assist the latter in improving their efficiency, sustainability and financial autonomy. It also aimed to initiate sector reforms, particularly with respect to institutional arrangements, the regulatory framework, demand management, as well as prepare a sanitation strategy.
The Tehran Sewerage Project, supported by a US$ 145m loan, closed in 2008. Its objective was to improve the environmental conditions in the Greater Tehran area through the installation of wastewater collection and treatment facilities, to improve public health, and enable unrestricted irrigation practices in the surrounding areas. Chlorination would disinfect effluents treated at the secondary level for suitable irrigation purposes, and a further tertiary treatment was to be extended if required. Treated effluents, and sludge were to be reused for agricultural purposes. The project allowed to connect more than 1.3 million people to the sewer system and to build a wastewater treatment plant that was completed in June 2009. A World Bank completion report concluded that the project reached its objectives and performed satisfactorily.

Altona (West Virginia)

Altona, near Charles Town, West Virginia, is a historic farm with an extensive set of subsidiary buildings. The original Federal style house was built in 1793 by Revolutionary War officer Abraham Davenport on land purchased from Charles Washington. The house was expanded by Abraham's son, Colonel Braxton Davenport. During the Civil War the farm was a favored encampment. Generals Philip Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant both used the house as a headquarters and meeting place.
The farm was sold out of the Davenport family in 1906, but repurchased in 1936. In the interim, a Sears, Roebuck house was added to the property. 
History.
Major Abraham Davenport, Sr.'s 1793 house was a wood-frame structure built on land purchased from Charles Washington, adjoining several Washington family homes, including Blakeley, Claymont Court and Harewood. Davenport became a Jefferson County magistrate in 1801, and was sheriff in 1803. His son, Colonel Braxton Davenport took over the farm in 1830. Col. Davenport added the present brick front to the original house, as well as the impressive stone fence that lines the road between Charles Town and Middleway. The house was named at this time for Mrs. Davenport's family home in Germany.
Colonel Davenport, who had served in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812, followed his father as Jefferson County magistrate, and arraigned John Brown in his court in 1859. Braxton Davenport was also a Virginia state legislator, serving four terms.
During the Civil War, Altona became a favorite headquarters for Union and Confederate forces. The front drawing rooms were used for conferences, and Sheridan used the farm's horses and carriage. Altona was therefore saved from the destruction that overtook other nearby estates. Altona served as a refuge when nearby Locust Hill was the scene of fighting and destroyed.
Colonel Davenport's son, Henry Bedinger Davenport had served as a lieutenant of militia in the company that captured John Brown. He served in a similar unit in the Confederate Army. Henry continued to operate the farm after his father's death and extended the stone fence. He died in 1901 . The family sold the farm in 1906. Between 1906 and the re-purchase of the property by Henry Davenport, Jr. the barn was doubled in size and a Sears, Roebuck house was built on the property next to the mansion house. The house remains in the Davenport family.
Description.
Main house.
The main house is a two-story five-bay brick house, painted white on a local limestone foundation, with a hipped slate roof. The roof was raised in 1936 and dormers were added. Paired chimneys rise on the east and west sides. The weatherboard 1793 house remains as the rear portion of the main house, but was clad in brick in 1936. The 1936 renovation also added formal entry porches on the south and east sides. Windows are typically six-over-six double-hung sashes with brick flat arches.
The interior is oriented around a center hall leading to the kitchen at the rear. The hall is entered through the south porch door, which is topped by a leaded glass fanlight. Two symmetrical living rooms flank the hall at the front. The 1793 portion of the house contains a reception room and a dining room. The second floor is arranged in the same manner as the first, with rooms, doors and fireplaces in the same locations. The main stair continues to the attic. The basement contains a similar room arrangement to the first floor, with fireplaces in the rooms.
Bank barn.
The long bank barn is built on a cut local limestone foundation, with weatherboard forebay and upper level. Two large square cupolas are placed over old and new sections of the barn. The original brick gable of the old barn remains in the interior where the old and new sections join. Stalls are found in the old section, while the newer section is a large loafing shed.
Sears Roebuck house.
The Sears house to the west of the main house is an American Foursquare, listed in the Sears catalog as "Dream House." The two-story hipped-roof house stands on a local limestone foundation. A plaque in one of the brick piers at the front reads "Dream House 1920."
Garage/Guest house.
The 1936 garage is a two stories, with a basement. A 1967 addition added expanded guest quarters and altered the interiors."
Accessory structures.
Other structures on the property include a late 19th-century limestone outhouse, early 19th-century frame slave quarters, a late 19th-century brick smokehouse, and two mid-19th-century corncribs. Several other buildings and structures contribute to the ensemble."

Cleinias, brother of Alcibiades

Cleinias () was the son of Cleinias, and a younger brother of the famous Athenian statesman Alcibiades, and a member of the wealthy and influential Alcmaeonidae family. Pericles, who was the guardian of the youths, and who feared Alcibiades might somehow corrupt Cleinias, sent the latter away from his own house and placed him for education with his (that is, Pericles') brother Ariphron; but the latter sent him back at the end of six months, finding it impossible to make anything of him. In one of the dialogues of Plato, he is spoken of as quite a madman.

Thomas Quinlan (impresario)

Thomas Quinlan, (10 March 1881, Bury – 20 November 1951, Holborn) was a musical impresario, best known for founding the Quinlan Opera Company.
Early life and career.
Thomas Quinlan was the son of Dennis Quinlan, a railway clerk, and Ellen Quinlan, née Carroll. He was the eldest of five children.
Quinlan studied as an accountant, and in 1901 he was company secretary of the Withnell Brick company. He also trained as a baritone; he was first coached by Granville Bantock, and later studied for the operatic stage under Victor Maurel. He began music management in 1906, touring among others Enrico Caruso, Fritz Kreisler, John Philip Sousa and including a Nellie Melba tour of Ireland in 1908.
On 4 July 1907 he married Dora Collins (daughter of James Collins, a tea merchant) at St Peter and St Edward Church, 43 Palace Street, Pimlico, London SW1. The witnesses were Gertrude Browning and the pianist Angelo Fronani, who married the opera singer Zelie de Lussan in 1907.
1910.
In 1910 London heard – or had the opportunity of hearing – more opera than ever before in its history. Between mid-February and New Year's Eve, Sir Thomas Beecham either conducted or was responsible as impresario for 190 performances at Covent Garden Opera House and His Majesty's Theatre.
Beecham extended his dream into the provinces with The Beecham Opera Comique Company. As his manager, he chose Thomas Quinlan. The company would present two "tuneful lightweights" as he called them, "The Tales of Hoffman" and "Die Fledermaus". The latter was known at first as "The Bat", but soon it became "A Viennese Masquerade" and then it was dropped, Hoffman being given exclusively. Some cities experienced one or both operas for the first time. Six evening and one or two matinee performances were given weekly in thirteen cities during the autumn segment (Blackpool, Belfast, Dublin, London, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Brighton) with fourteen more after Christmas (Swansea, Fulham, Bournemouth, Dublin, Southampton, Leicester, Wolverhampton, Hull, Manchester, Sheffield, Bristol, Cardiff, Plymouth, and Portsmouth).
1911.
Thomas Quinlan then decided to set up his own company, feeling that the provinces and "the dominions beyond the seas", as he told J.D. Fitzgerald in an interview in The Lone Hand in Sydney, had never had the chance of hearing grand opera on the same scale as Covent Garden. In 1911 the Quinlan Opera Company was formed in Liverpool. Quinlan personally supervised everything, casting the operas himself, and seeing every act of every opera before it was presented to the public.
The company rehearsed in London for five months before touring the provinces, (opening in Liverpool, where the results exceeded Quinlan's expectations), making a visit to Ireland with performances at the Theatre Royal Dublin from 26 December 1911 to 9 January 1912, and then setting off for Australia for the 1912 season. In February 1912 the company performed in South Africa (Cape Town and Johannesburg) on their way to Australia.
1912.
The first week of the 1912 season presented in conjunction with the Australian impresario J.C. Williamson, at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, put up a record still unbroken and likely to remain so: four Australian premieres in eight days. The company opened on Saturday, 8 June (having only arrived in the country the previous Wednesday), with a gala premiere of "The Tales of Hoffmann", followed on the Monday by the first performance in Australia of the Paris version of "Tannhäuser", the Australian premiere of "The Girl of the Golden West" on the Tuesday, another performance of "Hoffmann" on the Wednesday, "Rigoletto" on the Thursday, the Australian premiere of "Tristan und Isolde" on the Friday, and the Australian premiere of "The Prodigal Son" by Debussy as part of a double bill with "Hänsel und Gretel" on the Saturday afternoon, with Hoffmann again that night. This quick start and rate of bringing forward new productions was only possible because this was a complete company, with its own chorus and orchestra — the only one to visit Australia — and had already performed all its repertoire in England and South Africa on its way to Australia.
The Australian tour was limited to just ten weeks (five in Melbourne and five in Sydney). The presentation of fifteen operas, four of them new, in just under five weeks, in itself provided plenty of variety. The remaining operas were "Die Walküre", "Aida", "La Bohème", "Carmen", "Lohengrin", "Madama Butterfly", "Faust" and "La traviata".
The artists were mostly British, with two returning Australian singers, Lalla Miranda and Julia Caroli. The company also included the British tenor John Coates and Britain's leading dramatic soprano, Agnes Nicholls. There was a total of 163 people in the party (plus a three-year-old child for "Butterfly"), including the permanent orchestra of 55 and a chorus of 60, and there were three conductors: Ernst Knoch for the Wagner operas, "Hoffmann", "Hansel and Gretel" and "Carmen"; Tullio Voghera, who had conducted at the Met and been Caruso's accompanist, from the Royal Opera Stockholm, for the Italian repertoire, and English composer/conductor Hubert Bath, who conducted the opening of "Faust" and took over other operas later in the run. He was also chorus-master.
Staging and presentation were of a high standard, under the direction of Louis P. Verande (assisted by George King), from Covent Garden where he had been responsible for the staging of Thomas Beecham's controversial 1910 "Salome". Verande also had extensive Continental and American experience. All the costumes were designed by Dorothy Carleton Smyth from Glasgow, an authority on historical pageant and theatrical costumes, who travelled with the company. Quinlan pointed out that she concentrated on a harmoniously blended colour scheme, eschewing extraneous spangles and similar gewgaws. The sets for all the operas were designed by Oliver Percy Bernard, from the Boston Opera, and set models for the Puccini operas were first passed by the composer; while Humperdinck, Debussy, Cosima Wagner, Ricordi and other authorities lent their assistance with others. Quinlan claimed the largest scenic studio in England and said that a great deal of research had been done on the historical accuracy of stage accessories. The cost of moving the company and all the baggage — 365 tons of scenery, props and costumes — around the world was £100,000.
Except for Lalla Miranda, who had concert engagements in Brisbane, the company sailed for England on the day after the last performance, visiting Melbourne on the way for a Town Hall concert. Quinlan promised to return the following year, and to bring back not only the complete Ring, but also "The Mastersingers" and "Louise".
1913 - 1914.
After their return to England in 1912, the company undertook a provincial tour (including a performance in Newcastle in March 1913), followed by visits to Ireland (with a performance at the Theatre Royal, Dublin on 14 May 1913) and South Africa (June to July 1913) on the way back to Australia, staging the first complete Ring Cycle in Australia.
Although The Ring was the highlight of the 1913 visit to Australia, there was another important Australian Wagner premiere, "The Mastersingers of Nuremberg", as well as the premieres of "Louise (opera)" and "Manon Lescaut". Apart from these, it was the sheer number of operas performed which was so impressive. In just under eight weeks in Melbourne, the company performed 25 operas, including two Ring cycles; while in Sydney, where the original season of seven weeks was extended to nine because a strike in New Zealand made it impossible to move on there as planned, another three operas were added. In all, nine of the major Wagner operas were staged — all except Parsifal — four of them for the first time; all the major Puccini operas written at the time: "Manon Lescaut", "La Bohème", "Tosca", "Madama Butterfly", "The Girl of the Golden West"; the four most popular Verdi operas: "Rigoletto", "II Trovatore", "La traviata" and "Aida"; other Italian works: "Cavalleria rusticana", "Pagliacci" and "The Barber of Seville"; "The Marriage of Figaro"; and an assortment of French operas, from the new "Louise" and "The Prodigal Son", to "The Tales of Hoffmann", "Samson and Delilah" and the old favourites "Carmen" and "Faust". Not surprisingly, some had only one performance in each city, though most had two or three — sometimes by popular demand. Exceeding that number were only "Bohème" and "Butterfly" (four each in Sydney), "Samson and Delilah" (five in Sydney) and, way out in front, "Hoffmann" (seven in Melbourne, eight in Sydney), its total of fifteen more than twice that of the nearest competitor ("Samson and Delilah" with seven).
It was not simply a visit to Australia, but part of a tour round the world, what Quinlan himself in an interview on arrival in Sydney, called an "All-Red Tour" (a phrase which meant something rather different in the days before the sun set on the British Empire). The intention was to return to England via New Zealand and Canada, "never", said Quinlan, "leaving the red portions of the geographical map except to hop over the border from Canada to visit some of our American cousins... We sing in English to English-speaking peoples all the time." 
The era came to an end in March 1914 with a three-week visit of the Quinlan English Opera Co at His Majesty's Theatre, Montreal; Wagner's complete Der Ring des Nibelungen was sung in Canada for the first time (and by 1990 still the only time), along with "Tannhäuser", "Lohengrin", "The Flying Dutchman", and "Tristan und Isolde". But attendance was poor, and the company decided to cut its losses and terminate its visit to Canada, even though performances had already been announced for Toronto.
Unfortunately problems in New Zealand and Canada interfered with his grand plan of performing nine Ring cycles around the world in the space of six months, a feat he had been confident would "be mentioned with bated breath in European art circles", and the enterprise proved ruinous. Quinlan estimated that it "cost £150,000 a year to run grand opera round the world", and with disruptions to the schedule, the incomings were not enough to balance this figure.
Quinlan's enterprise came unstuck and he managed no more grand opera seasons. Despite the crash in Canada some artists had definitely been re-engaged and contracts signed. But the outbreak of World War I put paid finally to the possibility of Quinlan's plan to bring another company to Australia in 1915. The Quinlan Company became the Harrison Frewin Company, which was acquired by the impresario H B Phillips in 1916 for £1,750. In October 1918 the Carl Rosa Company acquired the Phillips and Harrison Frewin companies.
1919 - 1921.
In 1919 Thomas Quinlan was reported to be in London in concert management.
The 1919–1920 season of Quinlan Subscription Concerts included performances in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh by the Halle Orchestra conducted by Hamilton Harty, with Arthur De Greef (piano) October 1919, and by the Sir Thomas Beecham Orchestra conducted by Albert Coates (musician) with various soloists February 1920. There was also a performance at the Theatre Royal, Dublin.
The 1920–1921 season of Quinlan Subscription Concerts included a series of five concerts at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh October 1920 to 19 March 1921. The second in series was performed by the Sir Thomas Beecham Orchestra conducted by Albert Coates (musician) with various soloists. There was also a series of 12 concerts at Kingsway Hall 1920 to January 1921 featuring various orchestras, including the Quinlan Orchestra and the British Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Adrian Boult.
1922 - 1951.
In 1922 Thomas Quinlan, in association with E.J. Carroll, arranged a tour of Australia by the Sistine Chapel Choir, which turned out to be a financial failure. In 1926 his wife, Dora, divorced him on the ground of desertion. He died in London in November 1951.

8 cm kanon vz. 30

The 8 cm kanon vz. 30 (Cannon model 30) was a Czech field gun used in the Second World War. Guns captured after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 were taken into Wehrmacht service as the 8 cm FK 30(t). It was used by a variety of German units during World War II, including I./SS-Artillerie-Abteilung 3 between 1939 and 1940.
Design & history.
It was modified from an earlier Skoda design, the 7.5 cm kanon vz. 28, that attempted to combine the field, mountain and anti-aircraft roles into one weapon. It proved to be fairly successful at the first two, but was a failure at the third. The Czechs decided to adopt it to replace their plethora of aged Austro-Hungarian field guns. They deleted the firing platform of the original design and modified it to use standard Czech ammunition. It shared the same carriage that could break down into three pieces for transport as the 10 cm houfnice vz. 30.

Nearly a year and a half after their debut, Arashi released their first studio album "". Like "Arashi", it also peaked at number one on the Oricon charts. Until the release of their tenth anniversary compilation album "All the Best! 1999–2009", "Arashi No.1 Ichigou: Arashi wa Arashi o Yobu!" remained the group's best-selling album with overall sales of 323,030 for nearly ten years.

1990–91 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1990-91 campaign was a very mediocre season for the Terriers, with Town finishing 11th in Eoin Hand's third season in charge. They finished only 4 places and 6 points off the play-offs.
Review.
Following the departure of Craig Maskell to Reading during the close season, many Town fans were wondering where Town's goals were going to be coming from for the 1990-91 season. The answer seemed to be their new record signing from Watford, the Welsh international Iwan Roberts, signed for £275,000. In the early part of the season however, he only managed 3 goals in the first 13 league games, which actually made him Town's top scorer at the time along with Keith Edwards. But despite this, Town kept producing wins on a regular period and many still thought that the play-offs at least were still a realistic possibility.
Between November and March, Town were on a very impressive run of only 5 losses in 26 games, including 12 wins. Many of the goals did come from the boot of Iwan Roberts, as well as Kieran O'Regan, who each scored 14 goals in all competitions. Many still believed that Eoin Hand would lead Town to the play-offs and promotion to Division 2.
However, the last seven games saw Town lose four and win only one, which saw Town miss out on the play-offs by only 6 points and 4 places. Interestingly, Town were also awarded a record 14 penalties that season, but they only scored 9 of them, so the record of 11 penalties scored in a season, set in the 1983-84 season remained.

Escape from Hell (novel)

Escape from Hell is a fantasy novel written by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. It is a sequel to "Inferno", the 1976 Hugo Award- and Nebula Award-nominated book by the same authors. It was released on February 17, 2009. 
The novel continues the story of deceased science fiction writer Allen Carpenter (who spelled his name "Carpentier" on his novels) in his quest to help other damned souls in Hell. Like the first book, “Escape from Hell” extensively references Dante's "Inferno". Jerry Pournelle, one of the book's co-authors, described the book as "Dante meets Vatican II."
Plot.
Following events in the first novel, in which Carpenter learned that it is possible to leave Hell, Carpenter wants to help others in the way his benefactor helped him. Carpenter meets and travels through all the circles of the Hell described by Dante. He is accompanied in his travels by Sylvia Plath (whom he rescues from the Wood of the Suicides by burning her tree, causing her physical body to reform itself), attempting to understand the purpose of Hell and free many of the damned. Carpenter discovers that, apparently because he returned to Hell of his own free will to help others, he now possesses powers and abilities such as his mentor, Benito, also displayed.
In his travels, Carpenter meets many well-known individuals deceased as of 2009. In addition to Plath, some of the notables encountered by Carpenter include:
In the end, and partly as the consequence of some unusual changes to Hell itself, Carpenter not so much escapes as that he is shown the door for being a troublemaker.

Loonalaid is a windswept, rocky, low-lying 1 km2 islet west of Vilsandi in the westernmost part of Estonia. The islet is exposed to the Baltic Sea’s predominantly westerly winds and weather systems. Historically, the area had many shipwrecks due to the winds, weather and numerous uncharted shoals. These were a hazard, particularly to ships accessing the Gulf of Riga, off the southern tip of Saaremaa.
During the days of serfdom, Loonalaid and adjacent areas of Saaremaa (called Oesel by the Germans) belonged to the Loona Manor, owned by Baron Hoyningen-Huene. 1830 Baron Huene sent a man by the name of Aadu All to live on Loonalaid, primarily to guard the hay that was grown there as feed for the manor’s livestock and prevent it from being stolen or burned. All, his wife and young son, who was 1 yr old at the time, became the islet’s first residents and built a farmhouse. Their son, Peeter All, grew up to become a seaman and businessman and eventually was able to purchase the family farm from the Baron.

And like all the other books, it received new, younger-appealing cover art and was rewritten to apply to today's society, economy and technology. It was written in 1980 by Gordon Korman.
Plot.
Macdonald Hall is having a severe budget problem. The Headmaster, William R. Sturgeon or by his nickname, The Fish, is taking budgetary measures like lowering dormitory temperatures and removing junk food from the menus in the cafeteria. When Bruno and Boots figure this out after being forced into Dormitory 2 with Elmer Drimsdale when he closes the third dorm building, they decide to try to gain Macdonald Hall some publicity in order to enroll more students and solve their money problems. Elmer Drimsdale comes up with a new machine that mimics a broadcasting system, with a lens and microphone pointed at a labeled diagram of a Pacific king salmon, but he informs the hopeful two that it won't broadcast further than the room. Still, Bruno uses it to channel his frustrations by pretending to be a conspirator of an evil fish organization (never appearing on camera but narrating the plans of the conspiracy). Unknown to Elmer and Bruno, the device can actually broadcast a radius of 43 kilometres around the school and overpower all commercial television broadcasts on its frequency within that range.
Meanwhile, everyone is trying to think of ideas of coming up with publicity. This leads to the idea of breaking the world record of the largest tin can pyramid. During the nights of the weekend almost the entire student body leaves the property to go and collect soda cans from nearby townships and villages. Bruno and Boots go all the way to Toronto, hitching a ride in the morning on a school bus field trip back to Ms. Scrimmage's Finishing School For Young Ladies, the girls' school across from Macdonald Hall.
Throughout the novel two undercover agents stay in separate rooms right next to each other at a hotel in the town of Chutney, one from the RCMP, the other from the OPP, investigating the fish conspiracy that people had been complaining about seeing on their televisions. They are both at first under the impression that the other is “The Fish,” the head of the evil organization, but soon trace the investigation back to Macdonald Hall.
During a night of interruption from Ms. Scrimmage who catches the boys from the hall trespassing on the property, she along with Mr. Sturgeon unwittingly come upon all the stored cans in the vacant dormitory three. The boys had been coming to get all the cans from the girls who'd also been collecting them. Mr. Sturgeon expects Bruno and Boots to be the culprits, but just before they tell him of the whole process, they are saved by Cathy Burton, one of their friends from Scrimmage's, who tells him that the cans are her collection. Thus, the cans are removed from the property to be stored at Scrimmage's and Sturgeon does not dispute this claim considering that Ms. Scrimmage, who has been annoying him, will have to deal with them herself.
In the climax, the police form a barricade around the school to attempt to arrest Sturgeon, whom they believe to be The Fish, due to his surname and the nickname "the Fish" that the students have given him. All the students, from both schools, come out in wonder. Everything is exposed as Bruno reveals it was Elmer's device that had caused it, but he hadn't known it was that powerful. Due to all the exposure from the police, the explosion due to Elmer's equipment being buried with the chemicals reacting to the shotgun blasts from Ms. Scrimmage, and most of all the press that had arrived to capture The Fish being caught, the right message gets through and the school gets its publicity. A record enrollment comes up for next year, solving all the school's money problems.
In the end, Ms. Scrimmage's Finishing School for Young Ladies wins the world record for the largest tin can pyramid, to Bruno's severe chagrin.
Macdonald Hall is stated to be located along Highway 48 and seven miles south of the fictitious town of Chutney, Ontario. (pop. 3100)

LAPD Metropolitan Division

The Los Angeles Police Department Metropolitan Division, also known as Metro, is an elite division within the LAPD. The Metro Division, which also contains LAPD's Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team, contains six platoons of specially-trained police officers. It is tasked with numerous crime-fighting duties including solving major crimes, surveillance, providing counter-terrorism details and attending high-risk barricaded situations, such as a hostage situation.
History.
Metro Division developed from a compact, mobile crime-fighting team formed by Chief James E. Davis in 1933. Named the Reserve Unit, it was formed to work throughout Los Angeles to specifically suppress criminal activity. By 1968 the unit was expanded from 70 officers to approximately 200 officers. In 1997, following the North Hollywood bank robbery, numbers were increased to approximately 350 sworn officers and 16 civilian support personnel.
The Reserve Unit was originally based out of Room 114 at Parker Center, the LAPD's headquarters. The code number 114 is used today to refer to the Metropolitan Division and its headquarters. Metro is now based at LAPD's Central Facilities Building.
Objectives.
The Metropolitan Division's primary responsibility (other than SWAT) is to provide support to the LAPD’s community-based policing efforts by deploying additional crime suppression resources throughout Los Angeles when needed.
Assignments of both SWAT and Metro Division as a whole include:
Organization.
There are five field platoons (B, C, D, E, and K-9 Platoons) and an operations platoon (A Platoon); all platoons are supervised by a Lieutenant. The Operations Platoon performs the administrative and support functions. “B” and “C” Platoons are primarily responsible for crime suppression. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), “D” Platoon personnel, respond to emergency situations involving barricaded suspects or hostages. “K-9” Platoon and “E” (Mounted Unit) Platoon makes up the remainder of the Division. The Division also maintains a doctor, crisis negotiators and other specialists in weaponry, computer science, and audio-visual technology.
B, C, E, and K-9 Platoons have gradually been issued the HK 416 rifle to be placed alongside the M4 Carbine.
A Platoon (Command, administration, and support).
"A" platoon serves as the command and administrative section and also provides the support function for the Division. In addition to the administrative duties, they coordinate Metro’s many tactical firearms training programs, ensure compliance with state-mandated (POST) training, and maintain the extensive armory of specialized weapons. Additionally, the Crime Analysis and Deployment Detail utilizes automated repressible crime information citywide to determine Metro deployment in identified high-risk areas.
B and C Platoons (Crime suppression).
"B" and "C" platoons are tasked with crowd control, riot control, tactical support elements, protection details, counter-assault teams, and crime suppression. Their most active function is maintaining selective enforcement details in high frequency crime areas and targeting repeat offenders and criminal predators. Particular efforts are directed to the suppression of burglary, robbery, auto theft, and attacking violent irrepressible crime. Both B and C Platoons often serve high risk search warrants. During most of the protection details and high profile events within the city, these platoons deploy heavily armed tactical units for added security.
D Platoon (SWAT).
D Platoon is the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team of the LAPD, provides the Department with 24-hour coverage necessary for immediate response to barricaded suspects, snipers, crisis and hostage negotiations, potential suicide-related situations, and other high-risk incidents. Rapid deployment, surprise, extensive tactics training and thorough planning are all parts of successful SWAT operations. SWAT currently operates the Lenco B.E.A.R. and two smaller Lenco BearCat and one MedCat armored rescue vehicles.
E Platoon (Mounted unit).
The "E" Platoon serves as both the LAPD's mounted police unit and the reserve unit of the Special Operations Bureau. The "E" platoon began as a volunteer/reserve officer program and was formally integrated into the Department in 1988. The platoon currently has 32 horses and is located in a state-of-the-art Ahmanson Equestrian Facility. Officers and their horses deploy on City streets or during special events and add to the Department’s professional image. Beyond that, the Mounted Platoon performs crime suppression duties and responds to crowd control incidents.
K-9 Platoon.
The K-9 Platoon deploys highly trained dog handlers and their canine partners to conduct searches and apprehend felony suspects throughout the Los Angeles area. K-9 personnel are deployed around-the-clock, seven days a week. They are available to assist any LAPD department with searches for felony suspects. Two K-9 officers have also been trained in search and rescue operations using dogs.
In 1990 the Liberty Award was created for police dogs who are killed or seriously injured in the line of duty. The medal, which is named after Liberty, a Metropolitan Division K-9 who was shot and killed in the line of duty, has only been awarded once in its history. Liberty's handler received the Medal of Valor for the same incident.
History of LAPD SWAT.
While not the first to use specially trained units, the LAPD was the first to form a specific SWAT team, and originally created the term, ""Special Weapons And Tactics"". John Nelson was the LAPD officer who came up with the idea to form a specially trained and equipped unit in the LAPD, intended to respond to and manage critical situations involving shootings while minimizing police casualties. In 1967, Nelson's CO, then-Inspector Daryl F. Gates approved this idea, and he formed a small select group of volunteer officers. This first SWAT unit initially consisted of fifteen teams of four men each, for a total staff of sixty. These officers were given special status and benefits. They were required to attend special monthly training. This unit also served as a security unit for police facilities during times of civil unrest.
In 1971, the SWAT personnel were assigned on a full-time basis to Metropolitan Division to respond to continuing action by subversive groups, the rising crime rate and the continuing difficulty of mustering a team response in a timely manner. Metropolitan Division, which had a long-established reputation as the tactical unit of the Department, was reorganized into 6 units: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "K-9" Platoons. The Special Weapons And Tactics Unit was given the designation of "D" Platoon, and at the same time formally adopted the acronym SWAT
The first significant deployment of LAPD's SWAT unit was on December 9, 1969, in a four-hour confrontation with members of the Black Panthers. The Panthers eventually surrendered, with three Panthers and three officers being injured. By 1974, there was a general acceptance of SWAT as a resource for the city and county of Los Angeles.
Famous incidents.
SLA confrontation.
On the afternoon of May 17, 1974, elements of a group which called itself the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a group of heavily armed leftists, barricaded themselves in a residence on East 54th Street at Compton Avenue in Los Angeles. Coverage of the siege was broadcast to millions via television and radio and featured in the world press for days after. Negotiations were opened with the barricaded suspects on numerous occasions, both prior to and after the introduction of tear gas. Police units did not fire until the SLA had fired several volleys of semi-automatic and fully automatic gunfire at them. In spite of the 3,772 rounds fired by the SLA, no uninvolved citizens or police officers sustained injury from gunfire.
During the gun battle, a fire erupted inside the residence. The cause of the fire is officially unknown, although police sources speculated that an errant round ignited one of the suspects' Molotov cocktails. Others suspect that the repeated use of tear gas grenades, which function by burning chemicals at high temperatures, started the structure fire. All six of the suspects suffered multiple gunshot wounds and perished in the ensuing blaze.
By the time of the SLA shoot-out, SWAT teams had reorganized into six 10-man teams, each team consisting of two five-man units, called elements. An element consisted of an element leader, two assaulters, a scout, and a rear-guard. The normal complement of weapons was a sniper rifle (apparently a .243-caliber bolt-action, judging from the ordnance expended by officers at the shootout), two .223-caliber semi-automatic rifles, and two shotguns. SWAT officers also carried their service revolvers in shoulder holsters. The normal gear issued them included a first aid kit, gloves, and a gas mask. In fact it was a change just to have police armed with semi-automatic rifles, at a time when officers were usually issued six-shot revolvers and shotguns. The encounter with the heavily armed Symbionese Liberation Army, however, sparked a trend towards SWAT teams being issued body armor and fully automatic weapons of various types.
1997 North Hollywood shootout.
The North Hollywood shootout was an armed confrontation between two heavily armed and armored bank robbers, Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr. and Emil Matasareanu, and both SWAT and patrol officers in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on February 28, 1997. It began when responding North Hollywood Division patrol officers engaged Phillips and Matasareanu leaving a bank which the two men had just robbed. Ten officers and seven civilians sustained injuries before both robbers were killed. Phillips and Matasareanu had robbed several banks prior to their attempt in North Hollywood and were notorious for their heavy armament, which included automatic rifles. LAPD patrol officers, like most at the time, were typically armed with a 9mm Beretta on their person, with a 12-gauge shotgun available in their cars (only SWAT officers were regularly equipped with automatic weapons). Phillips and Matasareanu carried fully automatic AK-47 rifles, with ammunition capable of penetrating regular police body armor, and wore full body armor of their own. Since most handgun calibers cannot penetrate body armor, patrol officers had a significant disadvantage until LAPD SWAT arrived with equivalent firepower and body armor; they also appropriated several semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer to help even the odds, though by the time this began to happen, SWAT had already arrived. The incident sparked debate on the appropriate firepower for patrol officers to have available in similar situations in the future.
First officer fatality.
Randal "Randy" David Simmons (July 22, 1956 – February 7, 2008) was the first member of the Los Angeles Police Department's SWAT team to be killed in the line of duty in its 40-year history (although an officer died in a training accident in 1998). He was shot and killed in Winnetka, California during a standoff with a barricaded suspect. He would be among five deaths including the suspect that day. Another SWAT officer James Veenstra was also injured in the same incident.
Simmon's funeral, which was attended by nearly 10,000 mourners including law-enforcement personnel from all over the world, was the largest police officer funeral in both Los Angeles and United States history. Simmons, who was a 27-year LAPD veteran, had been with SWAT for more than 20 years.
To honor his legacy, the Metropolitan Division Randal Simmons Explorer Post 114 was named and dedicated after his death to continue his youth outreach work.
Media representations of LAPD SWAT.
The SWAT police unit quickly became well known in the short-lived television series "SWAT" in the 1970s. In 2003, the film adaptation of the series starred Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell and LL Cool J, and was directed by Clark Johnson. The film was a success at the box office.
The "SWAT" series of computer games, created by Sierra Entertainment and developed by Vivendi Universal and Irrational Games, started off as an interactive movie follow up of the Police Quest series, which was narrated by retired LAPD Chief Daryl Gates, and was continued as a real-time strategy game, and then three first person shooters similar to the Rainbow Six series. All but the most recent one, "SWAT 4", have featured endorsements from the LAPD.
Controversial deployments.
The MacArthur Park rallies were two May Day rallies demanding amnesty for illegal immigrants which occurred on May 1, 2007, at MacArthur Park. Six hundred police officers, including Metropolitan Division officers from “B” and “C” Platoons, were tasked with crowd control.
When protesters began blocking city streets, the crowd was ordered to disperse; the orders were given in English to a crowd of mostly Spanish speaking demonstrators. In any event, a significant portion of the crowd ignored the orders and did not disperse, though a majority did so. Police officers formed a line and advanced slowly to clear the area. The officers proceeded about 50 feet at a time, allowing those complying with the dispersal order to retreat.
Officers were attacked with plastic bottles, rocks and other projectiles, and responded with tear gas, rubber bullets, and batons, with approximately 146 foam-rubber projectiles fired. Twenty-seven marchers and nine members of the media were injured, five people were arrested, and at least fifty civilians filed complaints with the LAPD regarding mistreatment by officers. A $13 million settlement was paid over allegations of civil rights violations. Seventeen officers and two sergeants from the Metropolitan Division would eventually be disciplined for their actions.

Wonder Woman (2009 film)

Wonder Woman is a 2009 direct-to-DVD animated superhero film focusing on the superheroine of the same name. The plot of the film is loosely based on George Pérez's reboot of the character, specifically the "Gods and Mortals" arc that started the character's second volume in 1987. It is the fourth in the line of DC Universe Animated Original Movies released by Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation.
The film is directed by Lauren Montgomery, who directed the second act of ' and did storyboard work for ', and written by Gail Simone and Michael Jelenic. As with all previous releases in this line of films, it is produced by acclaimed DC Comics animation veteran Bruce Timm.
Plot.
Centuries ago, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta (voiced by Virginia Madsen), battled Ares (voiced by Alfred Molina), the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta beheaded her son, Thrax (voiced by Jason Miller), whom Ares forcibly conceived with her, who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus (voiced by David McCallum) stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera (voiced by Marg Helgenberger) bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the aura of violence and death he could instigate, effectively rendering him mortal, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana (voiced by Keri Russell), whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood.
Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor (voiced by Nathan Fillion), is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the warlike, aggressive Artemis (voiced by Rosario Dawson). Steve and Diana meet and fight, and she defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa (voiced by Tara Strong), participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.
In the meantime, the Amazon Persephone (voiced by Vicki Lewis), who has been gradually seduced by Ares, kills Alexa and releases him. With the additional task of capturing Ares, Diana brings Trevor to New York City, where he volunteers to help Diana on her quest. An investigation uncovers a pattern of violence created by Ares presence that will lead to him given time, and the pair goes out to a bar while they wait. After some heavy drinking, Trevor makes a pass at Diana. They argue outside, but are attacked first by thugs and then the demigod Deimos (voiced by John DiMaggio). Deimos kills himself to prevent being interrogated, but Diana and Steve find a clue on his body that leads them to a concealed gateway to the underworld guarded by members of a still-extant ancient cult of Ares.
Once there, Diana attempts to subdue Ares, but he summons harpies that knock her unconscious, prompting Trevor to save her instead of stopping Ares. Meanwhile, Ares performs a sacrifice to open a gate to the Underworld where he persuades his uncle Hades (voiced by Oliver Platt) to remove the bracers, though Hades does not tell Ares that the ultimate cost of removing the bracers would be Ares' own death in combat. Later, Diana regains consciousness in a hospital and is furious that Trevor saved her rather than stop Ares. Trevor argues against her abuse with his own criticism of the Amazons' self-imposed isolation and their generalizations about men, and reveals how much he cares about her.
Ares and his army attack Washington, DC. Trevor and Diana arrive to battle Ares and are soon joined by the Amazons. While Ares manages even to summon the Amazons long dead from the Underworld to fight their own sisters, his scheme is stopped by Alexa, a member of the undead host, who reveals to Artemis a chant which nullifies Ares's control over them. The undead then turn on Ares but are destroyed by his powers. Hippolyta faces Persephone in combat and kills her, but in her dying breath, Persephone makes the queen realize that in shutting the Amazons away from the world of men, she has denied them the chance to live their lives as women.
Meanwhile, the President (voiced by Rick Overton) is influenced by Ares's power and orders a nuclear missile against Themyscira, presuming the island nation to be the source of the attack on Washington. This act of supreme aggression increases Ares's power, but Trevor takes the invisible jet and shoots down the missile just before it hits the island. Finally, after a brutal beating at Ares's hands, Diana finally outwits and kills him. Subsequently, Ares is condemned to the underworld to attend Hades as a slave alongside his son.
Later on Themyscira, in memory of Alexa, Artemis takes up the hobby of reading (with severe difficulty). Hippolyta realizes that Diana misses both the outside world and Trevor, and to make her happy again, she gives her daughter the task of being a channel for 'communication between men and women'. Diana accepts and returns to New York, where she enjoys the company of Trevor. Their relationship comes with the understanding of her larger duties, such as when Diana sees Cheetah robbing a museum and she excuses herself to stop the supervillainess as the newly christened Wonder Woman.
Production.
The film was originally advertised as having a storyline involving the Greek god Ares escaping Paradise Island in order to capture and control a mystic item called the Hand of Rage. He would then use the Hand of Rage to bring about World War III. This storyline was later dropped.
The film's casting director Andrea Romano explained that Keri Russell's casting as Wonder Woman was partly inspired by Romano seeing Russell's performance in the film "Waitress".
According to producer Bruce Timm, during post-production, many action scenes had to be edited after the first cut of the film received an R rating from the MPAA.
Promotion.
DC Comics gave out promotional light-up tiaras to those who attended the premiere of the film at WonderCon 2009.
Upon the DVD release of the film, DC Comics arranged for several promotional packaging concepts to be released through different vendors. Working together with Mattel, they created a miniature action figure of the animated Wonder Woman that was packaged together with the 2-disc DVD sets sold through Best Buy's stores. Images of the animated Wonder Woman were made into sheets of temporary tattoos and packaged with the single disc DVD of the film that were sold exclusively through Kmart's stores. FYE and Suncoast retail stores sold pre-orders of the DVD with a promotional film poster containing a printed autograph of the film's director Lauren Montgomery. The two-disc special edition DVDs sold at Target stores included bonus Wonder Woman centric episodes from the "Justice League" animated series and its spin-off "Justice League Unlimited", two shows produced by Bruce Timm. Borders Book Stores offered an exclusive "Making of "Wonder Woman"" booklet featuring storyboards and character designs. Finally, a lenticular cover was created for the DVD cover depicting Wonder Woman shifting her position, sold exclusively through Wal-Mart stores.
Reception.
From its previews at WonderCon and New York Comic Con to its DVD release "Wonder Woman" received mostly positive reviews and has an 86% freshness rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 7 reviews. Harry Knowles gave a positive review of "Wonder Woman" on his website Ain't It Cool News. Knowles enthusiastically lauded director Montgomery and the surprising brutality of the action scenes. Jim Vejvoda of IGN praised the film's humor, action, and vocal performances, singling out the "perfectly cast" Fillion. Jordan Hoffman of UGO.com gave a positive review, commenting on the film's great dialogue and the mature use of post-feminist themes in relation to perceived chauvinism. Reviewing the film for Comic Book Resources, Josh Wigler gave a positive review, but criticized the unexplained inclusion of Diana's invisible plane. An explanation was left out as Timm and Montgomery felt it was too convoluted and merely a pseudo-scientific explanation. The World's Finest cited a few inconsistencies but said overall it was "easily the best DC Universe Animated Original Movie title to date."
The level of violence in the film – both Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor are shown killing human adversaries in several sequences, and several beheadings in battle also occur – garnered some criticism. Chris Mautner, reviewing the film for Comic Book Resources, remarked, "It is just me or does it seem more than a bit...unnecessary?".
According to The-Numbers.com, "Wonder Woman" ranked No. 5 in DVD sales from its release of March 3 to 8, 2009. From the total units of 106,342, it made $2,040,703 in sales.
Novelization.
An adaptation of the film, entitled simply "Wonder Woman", was published in January 2009 by Pocket Star Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster (ISBN 978-1-4165-9873-2). Written by S.D. Perry and Britta Dennison, the book follows the film's plot faithfully, but it omits some of the incidental violence (Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor killing guards, for example) featured in the film.

Adams Avenue Parkway

The Adams Avenue Parkway is a private toll road in the U.S. state of Utah connecting U.S. Route 89 (US-89) to Interstate 84 (I-84) near Washington Terrace, Utah. The roadway opened in 2001 at a cost of $8.9 million and was created after decades of requests by locals to connect the existing Adams Avenue to I-84. This allowed commuters to bypass the rest of US-89 through Washington Terrace to I-84.
Route description.
The main access to the south end of the parkway is from I-84 at exit 85, a pre-existing diamond interchange with a local road in South Weber named 475 East. The four-lane, toll road, which has no shoulders or sidewalks, begins at Cottonwood Drive, I-84's north side frontage road. It immediately crosses a bridge over the Weber River (the Davis-Weber County line and north limit of South Weber) and the Union Pacific Railroad's Evanston Subdivision (the south limit of Washington Terrace). The parkway then curves northwest and climbs out of the Weber River's floodplain with a maximum grade of nine percent, reaching the toll plaza most of the way up the hill.
After one intersection with 5900 South, which presently serves only the toll road company's headquarters and a single commercial building, private maintenance gives way to a four-lane city street with sidewalks just shy of 5800 South. The roadway continues northeasterly to the top of the hill near 5600 South, where pre-existing Adams Avenue (500 East) heads north, passing the Ogden Regional Medical Center to an intersection with Washington Boulevard (US-89) on the Washington Terrace-South Ogden border. Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into Ogden as a minor street one block east of US-89, with a gap near 4600 South and more north of downtown Ogden. In 2006 approximately 1,400 cars traveled the parkway on an average weekday.
Tolls.
Tolls are collected in cash or via an ExpressCard account, a prepaid system that offers a discount for a $10 deposit to the account. The current toll is $1 in each direction for two-axle vehicles and $0.50 for each additional axle. Previously emergency vehicles (ambulances) were not charged a toll, however beginning July 3, 2003, they must pay the standard $1 toll. To allow quick passage through the toll barrier, these vehicles pay through a charge account. The Utah Department of Transportation worked out an agreement during local road construction for four days in 2003 to allow commuters to use the parkway free of charge.
History.
The parkway was opened in 2001after just under a year of construction and almost two decades of community requests. Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens urged the state to connect I-84 directly to Adams Avenue, bypassing the congested US-89. Then-governor Mike Leavitt suggested that a private company rather than the state would need to build the road.
The roadway cost $8.9 million (equivalent to $ in 2011) to build, of which the state provided $2 million (equivalent to $ in 2011). Additional funds came from taxes levied on property owners along the parkway. The entire stretch of road between Washington Boulevard and I-84 was built by the Adams Avenue Turnpike LLC; however, they returned most of the road to local authorities. The only portion not kept was a segment between about 5800 South and I-84.
The roadway is defined under Weber County Ordinance, Title 31, which grants a franchise to Adams Avenue Turnpike LLC for an initial term of 50 years (expiring in 2051).

List of Oldham Athletic A.F.C. seasons

This is a list of Oldham Athletic A.F.C. seasons in English football, from 1904—when the club began playing professionally—to the most recent completed season. The list details accomplishments in all competitions the club has entered. The club has never participated in any major competitions outside of the United Kingdom.
History.
The club was created in 1899 after Pine Villa Football Club folded earlier the same year. In the early years, Oldham played mostly at the junior level of competition. In 1899, Oldham Athletic played their first game in the Manchester Alliance League versus Berry's Blacking Works Second XI. The following season, the club would move to the Manchester Football League after finishing as runners-up. The club began to play professionally in 1904 as they moved into the Lancashire Combination B Division and were immediately promoted to the A Division by finishing as runners-up.
After two seasons in the Lancashire Combination, the club gained acceptance into the Football League in June 1907 when Burslem Port Vale resigned from the league. Unlike many clubs, Oldham Athletic gained early success in the league as they finished in third place in the Football League Second Division. By 1910, the club was playing in the top flight of English football after the club had finishing in the runners-up spot in the 1909–10 season. It would not be until the 1952–53 season when the club would once again win a trophy, as they finished at the top of the Football League Third Division North table. By the late 1950s, the club was in the Football League Fourth Division and twice had to apply for re-election into the Football League.
By the mid-1960s, the club's fortunes had turned as they gained promotion back into the Football League Third Division. In 1973–74, Jimmy Frizzell led Oldham back to the Second Division as the club won their first league title since 1953. Unlike the previous visit into the division, the club was not relegated quickly. In the late 1970s, the club were runners-up in the Anglo-Scottish Cup following a loss to Burnley 4–1 on aggregate. Under Joe Royle in 1989–90 season, Oldham had their best finish in a major English cup by finishing as runners-up in the 1990 Football League Cup Final. The following season, Oldham won the Second Division and were promoted to the Football League First Division for the first time in 64 years and, in 1992–93, the club was a founding member of the FA Premier League.
The club was relegated back into the First Division following the 1993–94 season with Joe Royle leaving to join Everton during the next season. In the 1996–97 season, the club was relegated for the second time in four seasons and were back in the Second Division. The 2013–14 season is Oldham's 17th consecutive season in the third tier of English football.

10 cm houfnice vz. 30 (howitzer)

The 10 cm houfnice vz. 30 (howitzer model 30) was a Czechoslovak howitzer used in the Second World War. The 158 weapons captured after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 were taken into Wehrmacht service as the 10 cm leFH 30(t). It was used by a variety of German units during World War II, including II. and III./SS-Artillerie-Abteilung 3 between 1939 and 1940 and SS-Artillerie-Abteilung 51 during 1941. 30 served with the Slovak Army.
Design and history.
It was modified from an earlier Skoda design, the 10 cm houfnice vz. 28, that attempted to combine the field and mountain gun roles into one weapon. The Czechoslovak army decided to adopt it to replace their plethora of aged Austro-Hungarian field guns. They replaced the wheels with modern rubber-tired wheels, but curiously chose to retain the crewman's seat on the gunshield. It used the same carriage that could break down into three pieces for transport as the 8 cm kanon vz. 30. It fired a shell.

Pilgrims on the Heart Road

Pilgrims on the Heart Road is an album by Peter Ostroushko, released in 1997. It is the second of the three albums Ostroushko calls his "heartland trilogy" — "Heart of the Heartland", "Pilgrims on the Heart Road", and "Sacred Heart".
Guests include Prudence Johnson, Butch Thompson and Bobby McFerrin.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, music critic William Ruhlman complimented the instrumental work, but wrote that in contrast to Ostroushko's previous albums, this album is "...a collection of songs with vocals, songs that treat a number of personal and political issues of obvious importance to the musician and which he treats at length... Ostroushko is as determined to display his instrumental dexterity on guitar and mandolin as he is to explore the lyrical subject matter... All of this makes for an ambitious, seriously intended album that sometimes comes off as preachy and self-important, sincere as it may be."

Ena Lake, Ontario

Ena Lake is the name of a lake and an adjacent unincorporated area and railway point in Unorganized Kenora District in northwestern Ontario, Canada, about north of the city of Kenora. Formerly a stop on the Canadian National Railway, it is now a small cottage community of approximately 50 seasonal residents and 11 year round residents.
Geography.
Ena Lake is a typical Canadian Shield lake: the shore is rocky with many high ridges and hills, and the water is clear and cool.
The major inflows are Octopus Creek (locally called "Ena Brook") from Octopus Lake and the MacFarlane River (locally called "Corn Creek") from Corn Lake. The major outflow is the MacFarlane River, controlled by a small dam, below which one finds a rapids and falls. The MacFarlane River flows to the Winnipeg River. Thus, the lake is in the Nelson River and Hudson Bay drainage basins.
Transportation.
Ena Lake can be accessed from Kenora via Ontario Highway 658, then Ena Lake road. It is on the Canadian National Railway transcontinental main line, between Minaki to the west and Redditt to the east, has a passing track, and is passed but not served by Via Rail transcontinental "Canadian" trains. It may also be reached by boat via the Winnipeg River and MacFarlane River, from which a short portage leads to the lake. The historical and public portage route is tightly along the north side of the rapids/falls, starting right next to the dam at the out flow of Ena Lake, it crosses the road, where a sign marks the portage route. Boat trips to Redditt via the MacFarlane River and Corn Lake are also possible.
Natural history.
In the spring great flocks of White Pelicans fish for spawning fish in the rapids below the falls at the outflow from the lake. Flocks of up to 200 have been observed. The tributary Ena Brook (called Octopus Creek on topographical maps) and Corn Creek (called McFarlane River on topographical maps) have a boreal floating bog/wetland.
Fish species included smallmouth bass, walleye, and northern pike. Whitetail deer, moose, and black bear may be seen along the shore. Beaver and active lodges are present, especially along Ena Brook and Corn Creek.
Recreation.
Ena Lake is a popular starting point for canoe trips to Vermillion Lake, Octopus Lake, and beyond.

Cleinias of Tarentum

Cleinias of Tarentum (; fl. 4th-century BCE) was a Pythagorean philosopher, and a contemporary and friend of Plato, as appears from the story (perhaps otherwise worthless) which Diogenes Laërtius gives on the authority of Aristoxenus, to the effect that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus which he could collect, but was prevented by Cleinias and Amyclus of Heraclea. In his practice, Cleinias was a true Pythagorean. Thus we hear that he used to assuage his anger by playing on his harp; and, when Prorus of Cyrene had lost all his fortune through a political revolution, Cleinias, who knew nothing of him except that he was a Pythagorean, took on himself the risk of a voyage to Cyrene, and supplied him with money to the full extent of his loss.
A text written by Cleinias exists among some other Pythagorean philosophers' at the end of Iamblichus' "Life of Pythagoras" in the referenced edition, where his name is spelled "Clinias".

Bashir Yussuf

Sheikh Bashir Yussuf (, , born c. 1905 in Taleh, northern Somalia) was a Somali religious leader.
Biography.
In 1945, Yussuf emerged as a leader in the former British Somaliland. Yussuf, who is said to have been related to Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan on his mother's side, was devoutly religious and of a philosophical nature, a conscientious practitioner of the mystical sect of Salihiyya based in Saudi Arabia.
The popular impression at the time among the British colonial officials in Burao was the nationalistic teachings of Farah Omaar. Conversely, Yussuf was collecting arms and men with a view to establish his authority over the northeast portion of the protectorate. It was also freely rumoured that it was his ultimate goal to drive out the British; he was strong enough to lead a religious expedition against British rule. He organized headquarters in the east of the Burao region of the former British Somaliland, and quickly attracted a following because of his genius and religious influence.
During May 1945, Yussuf's force raided the European officials and military areas like the District Commissioner's residence in Burao. Before being counterattacked, Yussuf managed to move his troops during the night and retreated to his domain. His force was greatly outnumbered, possibly by hundreds. These men held a number of hills, which rose steeply from the light bush beside the wide sandy riverbed, which is known as Togdheer. There were only a few men to cover a front of 900 yards, and most of them had never been in action before, but they were determined that no British troops should force their way in unchallenged. The fight they gave was a lesson in determination which the British troops signally failed to emulate. Yussuf himself was in his natural element when fighting in the bush, but here he was given a position to hold and had no opportunity to use his bush tactics.
The British campaign against Yussuf's troops proved abortive after several defeats as his forces kept moving from place to place and avoiding any permanent location. No sooner had the expedition left the area, than the news traveled fast among the Somali nomads across the plain. The war had exposed the British administration to humiliation. The government came to a conclusion that another expedition against him would be useless; that they must build a railway, make roads and effectively occupy the whole of the protectorate, or else abandon the interior completely. The latter course was decided upon, and during the first months of 1945, the advance posts were withdrawn and the British administration confined to the coast town of Berbera.
Yussuf settled many disputes among the tribes in the vicinity, which kept them from raiding each other. He was generally thought to settle disputes through the use of Islamic Sharia. He was attributed with the possession of supernatural powers, and gathered around him a strong following.
Death.
The British administration recruited Indian and South African troops to fight against Yussuf and had intelligence plans to capture him alive. When he was eventually killed, Yussuf became a martyr and was held in great reverence. His family took quick action to remove his body from the place of his death at Geela-E.g. mountain, about 20 miles from Burao.

Refugium Peccatorum

Catholic tradition.
In the Roman Catholic tradition, Eve is viewed as being responsible for the sufferings of humans since their fall and expulsion from paradise while the Virgin Mary is viewed as the source of all healing. She is the new Eve, who cannot eliminate the damage created by Eve, but limit it. Her fullness of grace, her position among the disciples of Christ and her title as Mother of God are seen as assurances that the Virgin Mary is a powerful intercessor.
Prayer.
Refugium Peccatorum is one part of four Marian advocations in the Litany of Loreto, the others being "Salus Infirmorum" (healer of the sick) "Consolatrix Afflictorum" (consoler of the sad) and "Auxilium Christianorum" (help of the Christians). Each advocation extolling Mary’s role as advocate for spiritual and corporeal mercy has a rich history, but in general, the notion of asking the Blessed Virgin Mary for help in temporal needs dates back to Saints Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Ambrose of Milan.
Community.
The Archconfraternity of the "Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners" was established at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires in the 19th century, and spread throughout the world.
Art.
The 18th century Jesuit preacher Antonio Baldinucci had a particular devotion to the Refugium Peccatorum image of Virgin Mary in the Church of the Gesu (Frascati) in Italy and commissioned a copy which he considered miraculous and carried it with him in his travels. The Jesuits spread copies of the image of the "Madonna of Refuge" in Mexico by the 19th century, and it began to be depicted in missions there, often with clouds surrounding the lower portion of the image of the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus.
In some 19th-century images, biblical scenes are included below the image of the Madonna, e.g. Peter's visions as well as the depiction of a safe harbor (Psalm 108:30).
The term "Refugium peccatorum" is also used other works of Roman Catholic Marian art. For instance, there is a marble statue representing the Virgin Mary, on the grand staircase of the old municipal palace in Venice, Italy. The name came from the fact that the convicts were allowed to stop in front of the Virgin Mary’s statue to pray for their soul on the way to the scaffold.
Apparitions.
Our Lady of Laus, which the Vatican approved in 2008, is named Refuge of Sinners because she asked for the conversion of sinners.

Scotsguard, Saskatchewan

Scotsguard is a small hamlet in Bone Creek Rural Municipality No. 108, Saskatchewan, Canada. Located on highway 13 also known as the historic Red Coat Trail, about 10 km northeast of Shaunavon, Saskatchewan.
Demographics.
Scotsguard, like so many other small communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing it to become a semi ghost town with only a population of 3 citizens. Prior to December 31, 1953, Scotsguard was incorporated under village status, but was restructured as a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Bone Creek on that date.
History.
"Taken from ghosttownpix.com by Johnnie Bachusky"
For several years after the Canadian Pacific Railway triggered the creation of Scotsguard in 1913, the village was one of the liveliest spots on the prairie; new restaurants, a dance hall, hotel, pool hall and even a theater. In fact Scotsguard's early boom years earned it the moniker "Little Chicago" - mainly because of the proliferation of gambling joints, and that action kept the law busy.
During the roaring 1920s, Scotsguard's lone policeman, Luke Willy, could be heard shouting all over town, "Stop, in the name of the law!"
For a long time, especially during the Prohibition years, there was much to investigate. Bootleggers and rumrunners eagerly worked overtime, and their stock was popular at backroom poker games. While the police pursued, novel methods were created to stay one step ahead.
"My dad told me a story that one bootlegger was rumoured to be a woman " says current resident Keith Hagen, born in 1948 near Admiral, six km away. "One night the police raided her place but found her sick in bed. It wasn't until much later they found out that that's where she hid her liquor."
But as with every new community built along the CPR line in the Red Coat Trail region of southwestern Saskatchewan, there were also countless tales of pioneer prairie grit, courage and generosity. When the first settlers came to Scotsguard, there was abundant hope for future prosperity; as the new land was in the heart of a fertile farming district. The village was originally called Notukeu after the Notukeu creek which flowed past the townsite but was changed shortly after to Scotsguard as it was discovered there was already another village named Notukeu in Saskatchewan. The town grew quickly, and from 1916 to 1935, its population reached 350. Business boomed with those early years. The town had a bank, six grain elevators, a large stockyard, three lumber yards, three hardware stores, a pair of busy garages, a drug store, two grocery stores, an insurance business and two livery barns. Scotsguard, which had a mayor from 1926 to 1941, was also the seat for the municipal office of Bone Creek No. 108.
When it was time to rest, residents had three churches for spiritual relief; the kids had an ice cream parlor; and everyone could enjoy the local golf course, baseball field, tennis court and curling rink.
The Great Depression
Scotsguard's period of prosperity was short-lived. The depression and drought years hit the town hard. Growing competition from the neighboring communities of Simmie and Shaunavon squeezed out many local merchants, especially elevator owners as grain was getting marketed to Simmie. The bank closed in 1934 and the municipal office was moved to nearby Instow. To make matters worse, a fire in 1941 destroyed 11 buildings, devastating the town's financial heart.
The decline ultimately saw the town being officially dissolved as a village on December 31, 1953. The train station closed, the elevators began disappearing, but Island's General Store and the Scotsguard Post Office (S0N 2J0) within remained for another decade.
Nearly half a century later into the 21st century, Scotsguard's elevators are all gone as are most of its residents and the once prosperous business district.
Keith Hagen is one of only three residents left. He has lived with his wife in Scotsguard since 1987, and is often seen from spring to fall grooming lawns and offering visitors a tour of the once bustling "Little Chicago." A farmer and an accountant, Hagen also collects antique cars but his true passion lies in Scotsguard's history.
He plans to erect original streets signs and owns several buildings, including the old jailhouse and the two-sheet curling rink
"In my younger years, the first sight after grain elevators at every whistle stop was a curling rink," says Hagen, a teenage 4-H club skip. "It was often very cold but we'd bring sandwiches and put a can of beans on the stove.
"We were very community-minded," adds Hagen. "Scotsguard has always been a welcoming place."
Economy.
Agriculture is the top employment field with many surrounding farms and ranches.
Infrastructure.
Saskatchewan Transportation Company provides intercity passenger service to Scotsguard.
Education.
Scotsguard no longer has a school, but those who live in Scotsguard are sent to the neighboring town of Shaunavon which has a school that covers Kindergarten to Grade 12 serving approximately na students.

Zip 'N Snort

"Zip 'n' Snort" is a 1961 Warner Bros. cartoon in the "Merrie Melodies" series featuring Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner released on January 21, 1961.
Plot.
"Introduction": The credits are shown, and the coyote's Latin name ("Evereadii Eatibus") is among them. The camera then zooms to the left to show Wile E. Coyote pointing at the words and then himself. The Road Runner then pulls up behind him and beeps, sending the Coyote into the air. The Road Runner's name is shown ("Digoutius-Hot-Rodis") before he moves off stage, leaving a dust cloud for Wile E. to land in. The chase starts, and the Coyote slowly gains on his opponent until the Road Runner dodges off the road, leaving Wile E. at the mercy of an approaching bus. The Coyote kicks up a pothole and turns the other way, successfully outrunning the bus. However, as he taunts the bus, he runs directly off a cliff. As Wile E. hurtles towards the left, he pokes his tongue back in and points worriedly at the void below him. Then, he slams into a mountainside and soon suffers gravity. The Road Runner pulls up to the top of the mountain that Wile E. ran into and beeps to get the coyote's attention. Fueled by rage, the Coyote climbs the mountain, but soon falls back down. His second climb causes the entire edge of the mountain to fall as the Coyote scrambles to the top. Wile E. climbs to the top of the precipice and prepares to chase the Road Runner, but eventually realizes he's on his way down. He can only wince in puzzlement before hitting the ground a third time.
1. A simple plan - simply loading himself into a bow - leads to a simple denouement: running into the wood instead of going towards the bird.
2. Rather than face the Road Runner directly, Wile E. uses a grenade mounted on top of a model airplane to take out the Road Runner from above. However, when he sets the propeller in motion, only the propeller flies into the air. The Coyote soon figures out the situation and throws the entire model airplane into the air, but the grenade "still" remains in the air, spinning behind the surprised Coyote before exploding.
3. Returning to simplicity, Wile E. uses a wedge to throw a large rock, but it results in self-squashing.
4. This time, Wile E. lays out iron pellets covered with bird seed for the Road Runner to eat, while lying in wait on a high cliff with a magnet on a fishing line. However, the magnet attaches itself to a power line, electrocuting the Coyote - twice - and causing his nose to flash like a light bulb. The Coyote unscrews his nose and gazes at its flashing, looking amused.
5. The Coyote then attempts to load a cannon, but as he pounds in the cannonball with a stick, the cannon fires the two items out of it, with the Coyote still hanging on to the stick. Gravity results, and Wile E. and the stick land into the ground, to be pounded down by the cannonball.
6. Wile E. now lies in wait on top of a cliff with another, but much larger cannon as the Road Runner munches on more birdseed. The Coyote turns the cannon downwards as he goes to light the fuse, but the cannon falls off its mount, taking the Coyote down with it. He runs himself off to the right and finds the cannon facing him. Wile E. gropes downwards to escape the cannon's fire, but the cannon faces him again, but is now hovering right over his head. Wile E. sighs and soon realizes the inevitable, and is then swallowed by the cannon. The Road Runner moves out of the way as the cannon (with the Coyote inside) hits the ground. Then the cannon fires, sending it back up to its mount, which also causes the precipice to break and to fall back down on the Coyote.
7. Hoping to out-corner his rival, Wile E. greases his feet with axle grease and glides across the mountaintop, but soon sees the edge of the cliff. With no alternative, he grabs onto a saguaro and gets speared by its spines and he cries out in pain. Now, he can spot the Road Runner's trajectory and leaps off down the mountain slope, but instead of stopping in the middle of the road, he continues down the mountain and drops off it, and then onto the power lines seen earlier. Wile E. surfs these with no way to stop himself, but when he reaches the ground, he moves directly onto a railroad track, complete with an approaching train! Fortunately, before it hits the Coyote, he moves onto a side track. Wile E. points happily at the receding train, but now sees he's going into a tunnel with another train coming out of it. Wile E. strokes himself against the wind, barely keeping pace, and then the camera pans up to show the train is labeled: "NEW YORK EXPRESS / "NON STOP"". The camera cuts up again to the Road Runner in the conductor's compartment, apparently enjoying the prospect of chasing his opponent 2,500 miles across the United States.

Circle criterion

In nonlinear control and stability theory, the circle criterion is a stability criterion for nonlinear time-varying systems. It can be viewed as a generalization of the Nyquist stability criterion for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.
Overview.
Consider a linear system subject to non-linear feedback, i.e. a non linear element formula_1 is present in the feedback loop. Assume that the element satisfies a sector condition formula_2, and (to keep things simple) that the open loop system is stable. Then the closed loop system is globally asymptotically stable if the Nyquist locus does not penetrate the circle having as diameter the segment formula_3 located on the "x"-axis.
General description.
Consider the nonlinear system
Suppose that
Then formula_10 such that for any solution of the system the following relation holds:
Condition 3 is also known as the "frequency condition". Condition 1 the "sector condition".

Majoka

Majoka Or Majokah (Urdu:مجوکہ) is the name of a tribe originating from the South Asia. Majoka are settled in the Rajasthan state in India also Sindh and Punjab provinces Pakistan. The 'Majoka' tribe is considered to have originated in Rajputana and then moved to the Sindh province of Pakistan, near the towns of Larkana and Ratodero. From where they traveled north along the rivers to the present locations. According to some historians, Majoka tribe migrated from Spain in 11th century CE. This model about the Majoka tribe states that the Majokas are descendents of Spinard Arabs. It has been culturally and geographically interpreted that the physical make up and agricultural lifestyle of Majokas evident in Pakistan is a strong reflection of a Spinard Arab lifestyle. Systems of land division and familial hierarchies further prove the reflection of the Arabic way of life.
History.
Origin and migration.
According to the traditions of the Majoka tribe, their roots can be followed back to a certain "Qutb Shah Awan" who is considered the ancestor of the famous Awan tribe which claims descent from the family of the Prophet Muhammad. Qutub Shah Awan is said to have married a Khokhar-Rajput princess and begot a son named "Muazam". His offspring were named "Muazam kay" (those of Muazam) accordingly. The name "Muazam" was mis-pronounced among the rajputs as "Muajam" so that his children were called "Muajam kay". Over the time this evolved to "Maujju Kay" and later to "Majoka".
Some of the descendants of Muazam left the Rajputana area for unknown reasons and moved westwards to the banks of the river Sindh. From there they turned north along the eastern banks of this river up to the area of Panjnad. Leaving Sindh, they moved further north until they reached the present area of residence on the western bank of the river Jehlum. It is said that this settlement happened around 400 years ago.
At that time, it is claimed, this area was under the sway of the Baluch tribesmen. The local Baluch chief resided at the town of 'Khawaja Aab-e-Rawaan. He is said to have had a castle and an elephant. The chief asked the Majokas to come to his town and settle there under his rule. However, the Majoka tribe chose to remain at their place. Upon this the Baluch chief decided to attack them with his army of locals.
A fight ensued in which one Baluch was killed. The place at which the Baluch fell was called "Killi paT" (کلی پٹ) and considered the southern limit of the area of the Majoka tribe. This place is still known. The Majokas were led in the fight by a "Pir" (holy person) from the tribe of "Kanju", who are also settled in this area.
Sikh period.
During the Sikh rule in Punjab, an internal fight broke out among the Majokas. Two chiefs, Fateh Muhammad and Ghazi from the Sub-division of Tajay (see below) collaborated with the governmental administrator of the area named "Mahram Bhatti" and expelled an opponent Ahmad son of Khan and his family. After some time, Ahmad was able to win some Majokas to his side. A first attempt at the life of Mahram Bhati with the help of a barber failed, but the second one was successful during which a fight took place and the Bhatti fell in a dried well. Ahmad returned to the village and gained power after the death of Fateh Muhammad and Ghazi, becoming the chief of Majokas.
British period.
After the conquest of Punjab by the British, land was demarked. For this purpose Ahmad son of Khan, then the chief of the tribe, went with the British officials. He showed them the following limits:
From Killi Pat to JahaniaN Shah in south. From JahaniaN Shah to Nihang the eastern boundary. From Nihang to Thathi Bakhsh Shah the northern and from there to Killi Pat the western limits.
It is said that Ahmad took bribe from a woman named Bhag Bhai to avoid her area to be included in Majoka territory. She is said to have presented him a jar of Milk, which was full of money and some milk at the top so the British would not see it. Ahmad felt the weight of the jar and gave in to her request. Similarly he is said to have given up another chunk of land for personal gains.
Sub-divisions.
After the successful fight against the baluch, the Majoka tribe was divided into six families, each was alloted a portion of the land for settlement. These families were also encouraged to invite other Majokas, who had not yet joined this group at that time, to increase in number and gain power. The sub-divisions and their sub-families are as follows:
From among these families the Vero (both factions), Haider, PahaRi, Rohalay are considered to have been invited to join them. The whole subdivision of Langri is said to have been originally non-Majoka which was assimilated into the Majokas with time.
Majoka in literature.
The Gazetteer of the Jhang District mentions Majoka as a village in 1883.
HA Rose says in 1919 that Majoka are an agricultural clan present in the Shahpur area.
JM Wikeley counts Majoka in tehsil Shahpur in 1968.
G Tucker mentions a Majoka in Dera Ismael Khan district of the Khaiber Pakhtunkhawa Province of Pakistan in 1879. This might be some offshoot of the same tribe.
Present.
The Majokas are now spread in many countries around the globe, including, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Middle East, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA to mention a few.

Musée d'Art Dentaire Pierre Fauchard

The Musée d'Art Dentaire Pierre Fauchard is a museum of dental history located in the 16th arrondissement at the Académie Nationale de Chirurgie Dentaire, 22 Rue Émile Ménier, Paris, France. It is open Wednesday afternoons by appointment. The nearest métro and RER stations are Porte Dauphine, Avenue Foch, and Victor Hugo.
The museum dates to 1879 when Parisian dentists began to organize a dental school; with it the Musée d'Art Dentaire was established to display old techniques and tools. By 1892 its collection contained around 300 items. In 1937 the museum was renamed the Musée Pierre Fauchard to honor Pierre Fauchard (1678-1761), sometimes called the father of modern dentistry. Since 2003 its collections have been maintained by the Musée de l'Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris.
Today the museum contains over 1,000 items relating to the history of dentistry, including instruments and dental chairs from the seventeenth century to nineteenth century, about 350 items for the cleaning and extraction of teeth, about 200 dental prosthetics, as well as etchings, paintings from the seventeenth century Dutch School, and a library of about 500 antique books including an original edition of Fauchard's "Le Chirurgien Dentiste", published 1728. One item of particular note is the magnificent Charles X case, manufactured in the United States in the middle of the 19th century, which contains a total of 130 instruments for the maintenance and extraction of teeth.

<doc id="18305369" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18305369" title="Alternative Christmas message">
Alternative Christmas message

The alternative Christmas message is a message broadcast by Channel 4 since 1993, as a sometimes humorous and sometimes serious alternative to the Royal Christmas Message of Queen Elizabeth II.
Background.
Since 1993, Channel 4 has broadcast an "alternative Christmas message" usually featuring a contemporary, often controversial celebrity, delivering a message in the manner of Her Majesty. This tradition started by accident when, running a series of programmes on 'Christmas in New York', the channel invited Quentin Crisp to give an alternative message – playing on the pejorative term 'queen' meaning a very feminine male homosexual. In contrast to the Queen's message, the alternative lasts only three to five minutes. The concept seems to date back to a sketch in a Christmas special of "The Two Ronnies", where Ronnie Barker delivered a Christmas message from "Your Local Milkman". Examples of recent variations to the Alternative Christmas message proliferate on YouTube.
List of alternative message presenters.
2004 alternative message.
Marge Simpson was chosen to give the message due to Channel 4's recent acquisition of rights to broadcast "The Simpsons".
In it she commented on David and Victoria Beckham's marriage in a negative comparison with hers and Homer's, and compared the special relationship between the UK and the US to that of Mini Me and Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers films ("Helping out in all our zany schemes to take over the world"). Lisa Simpson also held a sign supporting Cornwall's secession reading "UK OUT OF CORNWALL," while chanting ""Rydhsys rag Kernow lemmyn"" (Cornish for "freedom for Cornwall now").
2005 alternative message.
The majority of Jamie Oliver's message was in the form of a comedy sketch, where he was a school cook preparing junk food, including "Turkey Twangers", for children. This turned out to be a nightmare, and he awoke to give a message about his wish for the new year being for British children to be fed better. He was chosen to deliver the message following his successful "Jamie's School Dinners" series. The broadcast also featured actress Jessica Stevenson as a dinnerlady.
For the first time, sister channel E4 broadcast an "alternative to the alternative message", delivered by Avid Merrion, the creation of comedian Leigh Francis from the series "Bo' Selecta!".
2006 alternative message.
This message was due to be presented by Khadija Ravat (b. 1973 in Zimbabwe): a British Muslim teacher of Islamic studies who has worn a niqab for ten years. The decision of Channel 4 to have a veiled woman giving the speech was a particularly controversial one due to the media attention that the niqab has received in the UK in 2006.
With regards to the decision, Channel 4 said that it was fitting that the "alternative Christmas message should be given by a Muslim woman in a year when issues of religious and racial identity and freedom of expression have dominated the news agenda."
The address went out at 3 pm, the same time as the Queen's speech on BBC1 and ITV1. Ravat had stated that she would not be watching her own broadcast in favour of watching the one given by the Queen. Her place was taken by another veiled woman, with the first name Khadijah. She was a convert to Islam in 1996 and took up wearing the niqab two years after she converted. She stated during her speech that her great-grandmother was a suffragette.
The alternative Christmas message on E4 was "Fonejacker's Christmas Message" in which actor Kayvan Novak prank-called members of the public. This five-minute broadcast was also a preview of his new series which aired in mid-2007.
2008 alternative message.
The 2008 Christmas message was given by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of The Islamic Republic of Iran. The message was given in Persian with English subtitles. In this message Ahmedinejad said that "if Christ were on earth today, undoubtedly he would stand with the people in opposition to bullying, ill-tempered and expansionist powers". The message was considered controversial and received much criticism both before and after its broadcast. Much of the criticism was centred on Ahmadinejad's allegedly anti-semitic and homophobic views. However, the message itself was not regarded as inflammatory and did not make any reference to these two issues. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called Ahmadinejad a "criminal despot, who ranks with Robert Mugabe, Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and the Burmese military junta as one of the world's most bloody tyrants". The broadcast resulted in almost 300 complaints to the media regulator, Ofcom, but it ruled that there was no breach of the broadcast code.
2009 alternative message.
The 2009 message was delivered by Katie Piper, a former model and television presenter who had featured in an edition of Channel 4's "Cutting Edge" documentary strand in October 2009. The hour-long documentary, which traced Piper's recovery from an acid attack in March 2008, had received significant viewer attention; it had received the highest viewing figures of any entry in the "Cutting Edge" strand during 2009, and received the most viewer responses of any Channel 4 show in October 2009. The documentary has since been made available for international broadcast. 
The huge response to the "Cutting Edge" programme led Channel 4 to invite Katie Piper to give 2009's alternative Christmas Message, which focused on the theme of "appreciating the beauty in life" and also allowed Piper to reflect on the huge public support she had received following the earlier film. The message also featured new footage of Piper and her family at home. Piper's message was aired at 3 pm and repeated at 8.50 pm on Christmas Day 2009, the later showing being broadcast following on from a re-airing of "Katie: My Beautiful Face". The 3 pm screening attracted 500,000 viewers and the 8.50 pm broadcast drew 400,000.
2010 alternative message.
The 2010 message was delivered by a team of midwives as part of "One Born at Christmas", a festive special based around Channel 4's hit documentary series "One Born Every Minute". "One Born At Christmas" was broadcast live in various slots on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and will follow the work of nursing and medical staff and chronicle the experience of parents giving birth over the Christmas period. It had earlier been erroneously reported that Dino "Dappy" Contostavlos of N-Dubz would be giving the 2010 message; Channel 4 later clarified that he would be featured in a segment on T4, not giving the main message itself.
2011 alternative message.
Two Alternative Messages were delivered in 2011. The first to air was a 'Just Be Yourself' message, airing at 13.55 on Christmas Day, and fronted by four people who appeared in diversity-themed programming during 2011 on C4: Max Laird of "Seven Dwarves", Susan Campbell-Duncan of "", Karen Gale of "My Transsexual Summer" and, giving her second alternative Christmas message (a first for the series), Katie Piper of "Katie: My Beautiful Friends". The second message, airing at 16.15, featured Vic Goddard and Stephen Drew, head and deputy head of the school featured in the hit documentary series "Educating Essex".
2012 alternative message.
Comedian Adam Hills, presenter of "The Last Leg with Adam Hills", delivered the message.
He was chosen to give the message following Channel 4's successful broadcast of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The focal point of the speech reflects on the success of the games and its successful "superhuman" promotion and how it changed the perception to disability. His speech concluded with the camera panning out to the Olympic Stadium and archive footage of the athletes (some quoted in his speech) during the games to the tune of Public Enemy's "Harder Than You Think", the theme tune of its coverages.
2013 alternative message.
Ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden delivered an alternative UK Christmas message, urging an end to mass surveillance. Mr Snowden opened his two-minute message, recorded in Russia, with a reference to novelist George Orwell, author of 1984, saying the surveillance technology described in his works was "nothing compared to what we have today". He said: "A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves, an unrecorded, unanalysed thought." He added: "The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it. Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying."

Élie de Rothschild

Baron Élie de Rothschild (29 May 1917 – 6 August 2007) was the guardian of French branch of banking dynasty of the Rothschild family. He followed his father as a partner in the family bank, de Rothschild Frères, and ran the Château Lafite-Rothschild premier cru claret vineyard from 1946 to 1974.
Lineage.
Élie de Rothschild was the younger son of Baron Robert Philippe de Rothschild and Nelly Beer. His father was a partner in de Rothschild Frères with his cousin, Baron Edouard Alphonse de Rothschild. His mother was the daughter of Edmond Beer, a great-great-niece of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, and elder sister of Marie-Louise Beer, who married Lionel Nathan de Rothschild from the English branch of the Rothschild family. Élie and his siblings (Diane, Alain and Cécile) were brought up at Château de Laversine, near Chantilly, and at the family mansion at 23 avenue de Marigny near the Elysée Palace in Paris.
World War II service.
He and his brother served as officers in a cavalry regiment—the "Anciens 11èmes Cuirassiers"—when Nazi Germany invaded France in 1940. Both were captured by the Nazis close to the Belgian border during World War II. Élie was taken to the prisoner of war camp Oflag X-B at Nienberg near Hamburg. After being discovered planning to escape, he was taken to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, then to Oflag X-C at Lübeck, one of the toughest POW camps. There, he was reunited with his brother. Despite being persons of Jewish descent, both were treated by the Wehrmacht as captured officers. He was released in early 1944. Elie later recounted that, despite the harsh condition of the prison, he had been treated well and respectfully throughout.
While in Colditz, Élie had written to his childhood sweetheart Baroness Liliane Fould-Springer and asked her to marry him, which they did by proxy by 1942—Élie being allowed to take his marriage vows while imprisoned. Her mother thought her foolish to take on the Rothschild name with the Nazis in control of France. However, they were not troubled during the Nazi occupation. The Fould-Springers had extensive interests in Austria, and one branch of the family owned Château Beychevelle, a Bordeaux estate close to Château Lafite in Pauillac in the Médoc.
Post-war life.
After the war, Élie, Alain and their wives shared the family mansion at avenue de Marigny, which had been used as the Luftwaffe headquarters during the war. Élie and his family moved to 11 rue Masseran in the 1950s, where he displayed his great collection of art, including works by Rembrandt, Gainsborough, Dubuffet and Picasso. This collection was described in the book "Great private collections", by Douglas Cooper; when Alvar Gonzales Palacios discovered a Dancer of Canova, he researched its history, and found out that, for a while, it had been in the Hotel Massaran, with the ridiculous attribution to Carpeaux.
Élie and his brother assisted their cousin, Guy de Rothschild, to rebuild the de Rothschild Frères investment bank, and its Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord subsidiary. Élie took charge of Château Lafite-Rothschild, the premier cru Pauillac vineyard in the Médoc, in 1946, which he owned jointly with Alain, Guy and their English cousin Jimmy de Rothschild. Élie became president of the family's Compagnie des chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) in 1956, diversifying into hotels, motels and restaurants.
He built a web of at least 20 secrecy-cloaked trusts in the South Pacific between 1996 and 2003, some of which continued operating after his death in 1997. As documents from the Offshore leaks revealed at least 20 trusts and 10 holding companies were set up for Rothschild in the Cook Islands, with typically opaque names including, fittingly, ″Anon Trust″. The companies have a common shareholder called ″Mandalor Limited″, an equally opaque company based in the Caribbean country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Élie was a friend of Prince Aly Khan and Gianni Agnelli. In 1954, when Liliane was out of town, Élie was introduced to divorcee Pamela Churchill (later Pamela Harriman). According to Élie, "She was sweet, charming and pretty. I wanted to go to bed with her and I did." Nevertheless, Liliane quickly saw off her rival. When the Duke of Windsor asked her: "Which Rothschild is the lover of Pamela Churchill?' she replied: "My husband, Sir". This remark undermined Pamela as much as any other retributive strikes and presently the affair receded. However, Elie de Rothschild continued to have a number of mistresses.
His nephew , son of Alain, took over at Château Lafite-Rothschild in 1974.
Death.
Élie died of a heart attack when on vacation at his hunting lodge near the village of Scharnitz outside Innsbruck in Austria. His wife predeceased him in 2003. He is survived by a son, Nathaniel, and two daughters, Elisabeth and Nelly.
He is also survived by a daughter (fathered with the Parisian antiquaire Ariane Dandois), Ondine, who bears the family name.

São João National Theatre

The São João National Theatre () is a theatre in the city of Porto, in Portugal. It is located in Batalha Square, in the historical centre of the city.
The history of the theatre begins in 1794, when the main authority of Porto, Francisco de Almada e Mendonça, encharged Italian architect Vicente Mazzoneschi with the project for an opera house. The original theatre was built between 1796 and 1798 and was named "São João" (St John) in honour of Prince-regent João, later crowned king as John VI of Portugal. The interior of the theatre was similar to São Carlos Theatre of Lisbon, built a little earlier.
The first São João Theatre was destroyed by a fire in 1908. A rebuilding project started in 1911 under the direction of Porto architect José Marques da Silva. The inner concert hall is horseshoe-shaped and has a ceiling painted by artists José de Brito and Acácio Lino, while the entrance hall is decorated with sculptural work by Henrique Araújo Moreira, Diogo de Macedo and José Fernandes de Sousa Caldas. On the main façade, of sober design, there are four reliefs representing four feelings: "Kindness", "Pain", "Hatred" and "Love", created by Diogo de Macedo and Sousa Caldas.
The new theatre was finished in 1918 but was reinaugurated only in 1920, with Verdi's "Aida". Initially, the theatre was dedicated to opera and theatre, but after 1932 it was turned into a cinema. Only in 1992, when it was bought by the Portuguese government, was the theatre completely restored to its former glory and renamed São João National Theatre.

Tutte matrix

In graph theory, the Tutte matrix "A" of a graph "G" = ("V", "E") is a matrix used to determine the existence of a perfect matching: that is, a set of edges which is incident with each vertex exactly once.
If the set of vertices "V" has "n" elements then the Tutte matrix is an "n" × "n" matrix A with entries
where the "x""ij" are indeterminates. The determinant of this skew-symmetric matrix is then a polynomial (in the variables "xij", "i < j" ): this coincides with the square of the pfaffian of the matrix "A" and is non-zero (as a polynomial) if and only if a perfect matching exists. (It should be noted that this polynomial is not the Tutte polynomial of "G".)
The Tutte matrix is named after W. T. Tutte, and is a generalisation of the Edmonds matrix for a balanced bipartite graph.

St. Mary's Church, Castlemartin

"St. Mary's Church, Castlemartin", located in the broad Kilcullen area of County Kildare, Ireland, is the first medieval church in Ireland to have been restored to full working order. The small stone Roman Catholic church, with accompanying burial ground, lies within Castlemartin Estate, which belongs to media magnate Tony O'Reilly; O'Reilly paid for the restoration in 1979–1980, after which the church was reconsecrated in August 1981 by Archbishop Dermot Ryan. There has been a church on this site for over 800 years.
History.
Accounts.
Details of the church's history are limited but it is recorded in church documents and has been the subject of a number of articles – including by Major General Sir Eustace F. Tickell, Lord Walter Fitzgerald, Brewer, Meagher and a correspondent to Beauford's "Anthologia Hibernica" magazine (who also supplied drawings) – and of a booklet.
Origins.
There is mention of a chapel at Castlemartin in a 1202 entry in the Calendar of Deeds of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, when Richard, Lord of Castlemartyn granted it to the cathedral. A later entry reaffirms the grant, along with of land.
The current church was constructed in the late 15th century, as place of worship for Sir Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester and his family; Sir Rowland was appointed as Treasurer of Ireland in 1461, and Chancellor in 1472, and his daughter, Alison married into the Fitzgerald family. Tony O'Reilly, based on research he commissioned, mentioned a possible construction date around 1490. 
The chapel is mentioned in the Calendar of Christ Church Deeds for 1503, twice. The second entry notes that residents of two local areas pay two pence towards Kilcolyn (i.e. Kilcullen) Chapel, and a third penny towards Castlemartin Chapel. A further entry, in 1504, confirms to Holy Trinity Church (Christ Church Cathedral) property including "the Church of Killkolyn" "with the annexed chapel of St. Mary's, Castlemartin".
There is no information now as to the extent of the staffing of the church, its exact relationship (sometimes described as dependency) with the church at Kilcullen (or the preceding church at Old Kilcullen) or the scale of burial activity within or around it.
Decline.
There is no record of when the church was abandoned, though it is believed to have been after 1700, and it was certainly ruined by 1793. For several centuries the church was roofless, and became overgrown. In 1862, Brewer, in his book "Beauties of Ireland" notes that the tomb within the church was overgrown and that fragments of monuments were scattered in the burial ground. Arms were concealed there undetected during the Irish War of Independence.
Restoration, 1979–1980.
O'Reilly consulted with local authorities and engaged Percy Le Clerc, an experienced former senior member of the Office of Public Works as architect. Le Clerc studied the church structure, and such limited historical material as was available, including the 18th century magazine article from which the sketches on the postcard above come, and concluded that the building had probably existed in three main states during its history, notably with differences in the upper parts, where there is an external walkway. It was decided to restore it to the middle state.
Planning permission was granted, subject to reasonable public access to the restored building being made available, and the restoration began on 17 August 1979. No significant excavation or other exploratory work was demanded or conducted, and most restoration work was completed by December 1980. The church was then furnished simply and modern electrical circuits installed.
Reconsecration.
As it was unclear what the ecclesiastical status of the church had been over the years of neglect, it was arranged for it to be reconsecrated. In parallel, Tony and Susan O'Reilly arranged for an illustrated booklet to be published, summarising the history of the church, its restoration and aspects of its interior.
The Mass of Reconsecration was conducted on 16 August 1981, led by Archbishop Dr. Dermot Ryan, who emphasised the historic nature of such an event. Invitees included family, friends and locals, with Tony O'Reilly's mother as guest of honour and hymn selector, music by Caroline O'Reilly and John Grogan, prayers by Tony O'Reilly, Junior and readings by Cameron O'Reilly and Tony O'Reilly's friend, rugby player Peter Kininmonth. Holy water, incense and chrism oil were used, and a chalice from the 1932 Eucharistic Congress Mass in Dublin. A silver chalice from 1643 was presented to the owner for use in subsequent Masses.
Since 1981.
The church has hosted Mass on a number of occasions, as well as family weddings, such as those of Susan Cameron to Tarik Wildman (before an Episcopal Dean) and of Gavin O'Reilly to Alison Doody, and at least one funeral, that of Tony O'Reilly's mother, Alison. It was also intended to have chamber music and other public events there.
Tony O'Reilly's parents are buried alongside the church, his father having been moved there from Glasnevin Cemetery, and he has stated that this will be his final resting place also.
Location.
The church is located in a field at the top of the banks of the River Liffey, within Castlemartin Estate. It is some distance north east of Castlemartin House and the estate farm buildings, reachable along a tree-lined avenue, and is adjoined by a small burial ground. The building is surrounded by a narrow strip of gravel, and flat paving. The church field is bounded on several sides by trees, and with a further field between it and the river, is not readily visible, nor is there a ready path for public access.
Structure.
The building has a simple floorplan, with a basic nave overlooked by a small gallery, and a footprint (internal measurement) of x 16.5 feet. There is some complexity with the stair and roof areas, and it is in regard to these that the states of the building primarily differed.
According to Le Clerc, the three phases of building were as follows:
LeClerc further commented that the church had been poorly constructed, using low-quality limestone and little mortar, and might have collapsed in the 19th century had it not been buttressed by Major Blacker. 
Taking into account the attraction of the twin towers, and the complication of the roof walk introduced by the third phase of work, the building was restored to the second identified state.
Tomb.
An effigial tomb was located centrally in the church, badly broken, the only visible monument remaining inside. This was also restored, as far as possible, during the work of 1979–1980, and relocated to a place under the gallery at the back of the church. The tomb, which features a damaged figure of a knight, may have been made for Richard, son of Sir Roland FitzEustace, Baron Portlester and Lord of Castlemartin or for Thomas, Lord of Castlemartin. Under the tomb was a vault in which eleven skeletons were found, and this remains "in situ".
Furnishings.
There is no record as to how the building was furnished but new furniture was made based on what is known about churches of the 15th and 16th centuries in Ireland. The primary material for furnishings was unseasoned oak, fixed with oak pegs, without any metal parts used at all.
