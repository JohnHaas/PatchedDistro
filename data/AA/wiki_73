San Antonio Museum of Art

The San Antonio Museum of Art (SAMA) is an art museum in Downtown San Antonio, Texas, USA. In the early 1970s, plans were initiated to purchase the historic Lone Star Brewery complex for conversion into the San Antonio Museum of Art and following a $7.2 million renovation, the San Antonio Museum of Art opened to the public in March 1981. The museum was funded through grants from the Economic Development Administration of San Antonio, and numerous businessmen and foundations.
The museum is situated on the northern section of the San Antonio Riverwalk. Café des Artistes is SAMA's restaurant which overlooks the river. 
When the museum opened it specialized in art of the Americas including pre-Columbian, Spanish Colonial and Latin American folk art. It also included eighteenth-, nineteenth- and twentieth-century American and European paintings, photography, sculpture and decorative arts. In 1985, the Museum received collections of Latin American Folk Art formed from former Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller and Robert K. Winn.
In the 1990s the museum expanded considerably with donations from Gilbert M. Denman, Jr., the addition of the Stark-Willson Collection which established a comprehensive collection of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art and a collection of Chinese ceramics from trustees Walter F. and Lenora Brown. The Chinese collection which also included other Asian objects resulted in a wing named after them, The Lenora and Walter F. Brown Asian Art Wing which opened in 2005 is now the largest museum for Asian art in the southern United States.
In 1991, the Cowden Gallery was opened for changing exhibitions and, in 1994, the Beretta Hops House was renovated to provide a new area for schooling with three main classrooms. In 1998, the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin American Art, a wing, opened to display Latin American art.
Former streetcar service.
From 1982 through 1985, the museum also operated a heritage streetcar service, using an original San Antonio streetcar built in 1913 and nicknamed "Old 300". The all-yellow car operated on a short section of Texas Transportation Company (TXTC) tracks behind the museum. TXTC was an electric railroad, operating trains powered from overhead trolley wires, and its tracks still reached the former Lone Star Brewery complex, in which the museum was installed in 1981. Streetcar service in San Antonio ended in 1933, but car 300 was preserved at that time by the San Antonio Museums Association. In 1981, volunteers restored car 300 to operating condition as a historical attraction at the then-new museum. Public operation began in October 1982. The car ran twice a day on Tuesdays through Fridays and six times a day on weekends, but budget cuts led to the service's being discontinued at the end of 1985. The 1913 streetcar was placed in storage, being operated (without passengers) a few times a year to keep it in running condition, until 1990, when it was leased to a company in Portland, Oregon, for use on the Willamette Shore Trolley line there. SAMA continued to be car 300's owner, leasing it to entities in Oregon, but in 2005 it sold the car to the Astoria Riverfront Trolley Association, who had been operating it on a popular heritage streetcar line in Astoria, Oregon, since 1999.

Adoration of the Magi (Andrea della Robbia)

This depiction of the Adoration of the Magi is by Florentine sculptor Andrea della Robbia (1435–1525). Andrea inherited the family workshop from his famous uncle, Luca della Robbia, who had developed the technique of applying tin glazes, similar to those used by potters, to terracotta (fired clay) to produce sculptures that were colourful, durable and relatively cheap. Larger sculptures, such as this example which dates to about 1500–1510, were made in sections in order to fit into the kiln for firing.
The scene is set in a landscape, showing the Three Kings with attendants, offering their gifts to the Holy Family. Andrea's sculpture was similar in style to contemporary painting, but certain colours, such as red, could not be produced in tin-glaze. The coat-of-arms of the Albizzi, a prominent Florentine family, can be seen on the frame, and the relief was probably commissioned by them for a church not far from Florence. The shiny surface of the altarpiece would have reflected the candlelight in the chapel, bringing the image to life.

John Payton

John A. Payton (December 27, 1946 – March 22, 2012) was a well-known African-American civil rights attorney. In 2008, Payton was appointed the sixth president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund serving in that post until his death. Prior to this, he was a Partner at the law firm WilmerHale for twenty years.
Payton was tapped to be the lead counsel for the University of Michigan in defending its law and undergraduate schools' use of race in their admissions processes. For more than six years, Payton handled the two high-profile cases in the trial court and in the court of appeals, and argued "Gratz v. Bollinger" before the Supreme Court of the United States.
Early life and education.
Payton grew up in Los Angeles, California, where he graduated from high school. He attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, where he became heavily involved in civil rights and anti-war protests. Payton was one of the founders of Pomona's Black Student Association. For three years, Payton served as an admissions officer at the Claremont Colleges, a position that he helped create to recruit black students. He graduated in 1973. He left the admissions position after receiving a Watson fellowship, which allowed him to study literature in West Africa for a year and, while abroad, he applied to law school.
After being accepted at and entering Harvard Law School, Payton worked on several civil rights cases and was a member of the editorial board for the "Harvard Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law Review". He graduated from law school in 1977.
Early career.
Following law school, Payton spent a year clerking for then-U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Cecil Poole. He then moved to Washington, D.C. where he was recruited to Wilmer Hale by James Robertson.
While at the firm, Payton worked on several important civil rights cases. He successfully defended the NAACP against an anti-trust lawsuit brought by white merchants in Mississippi who had lost business in the wake of a 1966 desegregation boycott.
In "City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.", Payton unsuccessfully defended the city's set-aside affirmative action plan established to assist minority businesses in receiving city construction contracts. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States where the Court narrowly ruled against the city and determined, for the first time, that all government uses of race - including affirmative action programs - would be subject to strict scrutiny.
D.C. Corporation Counsel and South Africa election observer.
When Sharon Pratt Dixon was elected mayor of Washington, D.C. in 1991, Vernon Jordan tapped Payton to become the district's corporation counsel. As corporation counsel, he reorganized, centralized and streamlined the corporation counsel offices. Early in his term, Payton dealt with the aftermath of the Mount Pleasant riots and worked to improve Latino and police relations in the city. He also participated in balancing the city's budget in the face of a major crisis.
In 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated Payton to head the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division. Following objections from the Congressional Black Caucus and despite some prominent African-American support for Payton, Payton withdrew his name for consideration.
In 1994 Payton left the D.C. Corporation Counsel office to join his wife, Gay McDougall, in South Africa. Ms. McDougall was in South Africa working as a member of the Independent Electoral Commission, which ran South Africa's first democratic elections that year. Nelson Mandela was elected president. At the same time, Payton served on an international observer team that included lawyers from the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The couple remained in South Africa for several months before going back to D.C.
Return to private practice and the Michigan cases.
Returning to Wilmer Hale, Payton took on a civil practice that included representing corporations in employment matters, the American Legacy Foundation in its efforts to prevent youths from smoking, and Fannie Mae in a major class action challenge.
While still at the firm, Payton was tapped to be the lead counsel for the University of Michigan in defending its law and undergraduate schools' use of race in their admissions processes. For more than six years, Payton handled the two high-profile cases in the trial court and in the court of appeals, and argued "Gratz v. Bollinger" before the Supreme Court. He organized a broad coalition from higher education, the military and top businesses in support of diversity initiatives. In a narrow decision in "Grutter v. Bollinger", the Supreme Court upheld the use of race in college admissions.
Payton served as president of the District of Columbia Bar for one year in 2001. He also recently served as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, the Georgetown University Law Center and Howard University Law School. He has been repeatedly recognized by his peers and news outlets as one of the nation's top lawyers.
Director Counsel of LDF.
In 2008, Payton was appointed the sixth director-counsel and president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. following in the footsteps of such civil rights giants as Thurgood Marshall and Jack Greenberg.

Spanish destroyer Almirante Ferrándiz

Almirante Ferrándiz was a "Churruca"-class destroyer in the Spanish Republican Navy. She took part in the Spanish Civil War on the government side.
She was named in honor of José Ferrándiz y Niño, a Spanish Admiral and former Navy Minister.
History.
"Almirante Ferrándiz" took part in the Gibraltar Strait blockade. When a Republican squadron penetrated the Cantabrian Sea to relieve Republican toops isolated in the North, she remained in the strait with "Gravina" to stop any movement of Nationalist troops between Africa and the Iberian peninsula.
In response, the nationalist heavy cruiser "Canarias" (which Republicans believed had been damaged by a bomb) and light cruiser "Almirante Cervera" were sent to break the blockade.
On 29 September 1936, at the Battle of Cape Espartel, "Canarias" opened fire from 16 km (8.5 nm), and hit "Almirante Ferrándiz" with her second salvo. "Ferrándiz" continued sailing away from "Canarias", but the heavy cruiser struck her again with a third salvo, at 20 km (10.8 nm). The destroyer took a total of six hits from the "Canarias"' 200 mm (8") main armament and sank 33 km (18 nm) off Calaburras with most of her crew. "Canarias" stopped to rescue 31 sailors from "Almirante Ferrándiz" and authorized a French merchantman to pick up others.

Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan

Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447 (1993) was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the assertion that attempted monopolization may be proven merely by demonstration of unfair or predatory conduct. Instead, conduct of a single firm could be held to be unlawful attempted monopolization only when it actually monopolized or dangerously threatened to do so. Thus, the Court rejected the conclusion that injury to competition could be presumed to follow from certain conduct. The causal link "must" be demonstrated.
Background.
Defendants held the patent to a polymer used in athletic goods. Plaintiff distributor refused to sell its right to develop goods made from the material, so that it could retain its rights to manufacture equestrian products. Defendants appointed another distributor. 
Plaintiff brought suit, claiming violations of the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.S. §§ 2 and 3, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1962, and state unfair practices law.
The trial court found defendants liable for attempted monopolization and denied their motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Defendants appealed, claiming that plaintiffs failed to prove the elements of attempted monopolization. Defendants claimed reversal was required where defendants' specific intent to monopolize was not proven.
Held.
The Supreme Court reversed, holding the trial court erred in finding evidence of unfair or predatory conduct was sufficient to satisfy the specific intent and dangerous elements of the offense. Without proof of these elements or the relevant product market, liability could not attach. The judgment holding that defendants were liable for attempted monopolization under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 2, was reversed absent proof of a dangerous probability that defendants would monopolize a particular market and a specific intent to monopolize. Intent could not be inferred by evidence of unfair or predatory conduct alone.
Reasoning.
"Every other Court of Appeals has indicated that proving an attempt to monopolize requires proof of a dangerous probability of monopolization of a relevant market."
§2 of the Sherman Act addresses the actions of single firms that monopolize or attempt to monopolize, as well as conspiracies and combinations to monopolize. However, it does not define the elements of the offense of attempted monopolization. Nor is there much guidance to be had in the scant legislative history of that provision, which was added late in the legislative process. Rather, the legislative history indicates that much of the interpretation of the necessarily broad principles of the Act was to be left for the courts in particular cases.
When in 1905 the Supreme Court first addressed the meaning of attempt to monopolize under § 2, it wrote as follows:
The Court went on to explain, however, that not every act done with intent to produce an unlawful result constitutes an attempt. "It is a question of proximity and degree.". "Swift thus indicated that intent is necessary, but alone is not sufficient, to establish the dangerous probability of success that is the object of § 2's prohibition of attempts."
"The Court's decisions since" Swift" have reflected the view that the plaintiff charging attempted monopolization must prove a dangerous probability of actual monopolization, which has generally required a definition of the relevant market and examination of market power."
The Courts of Appeals other than the Ninth Circuit have followed this approach. It is generally required that to demonstrate attempted monopolization a plaintiff must prove
"In order to determine whether there is a dangerous probability of monopolization, courts have found it necessary to consider the relevant market and the defendant's ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market."
Opposition to the Lessig opinion.
The Supreme Court explained its opposition to the Lessig opinion:

Goraj, Lublin Voivodeship

Goraj is a village in Biłgoraj County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Goraj. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north of Biłgoraj and south of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 1,048. Goraj was formerly a town. It was granted town rights in the 14th century and lost them in 1869.
The name of the village probably comes from a Polish language word “gora” (mountain), and is related to the location of Goraj, among the hills of the Roztocze. In a 1377, Goray. The document was issued by King Louis I, mentions that two members of local nobility, were granted "castrum nostrum Goray alio Lada... cum villis Lada, Radziecin...". The medieval Goray Castle, which was also called Lada Castle, probably was surrounded by a village, where servants and artisans dwelled. It is not known when the village was granted Magdeburg rights, it probably happened in the early 1370s, as in a 1373 document, a person named Demetrio de Goray is mentioned, which suggests that it aleady was a town in that year. In 1389, King Wladyslaw Jagiello confirmed Goraj’s charter. Until 1508, the town belonged to the Gorajski family, and in the 16th century, it was property of several noble families - the Firlejs, the Sienienskis, the Trojanowskis, and in 1595, it pas purchased by one of the most powerful magnates in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Jan Zamoyski, who in 1596 incorporated Goraj into his landed property, Ordynacja Zamojska (Zamosc Estate). 
In 1540, a Calvinist prayer house was built at Goraj. It remained in use until ca. 1625, and in 1561, the town received permission to build butcher shops and a town hall. In the same year, Goraj burned in a large fire. In 1648, the town was ransacked and destroyed by Cossacks and Tatars in the Khmelnytsky Uprising, it also suffered during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when, among other buildings, a local parish church was destroyed. By that time, Goraj already had a Jewish community, with a stone synagogue, built probably in the late 17th century, and destroyed by the Germans in World War II. 
Following the Partitions of Poland, Goraj, which for centuries belonged to Lesser Poland’s Lublin Voivodeship, was annexed by the Habsburg Empire (1795), and in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In the 19th century, almost all buildings were made of wood, except for the parish church and the synagogue. In 1855, the population was decimated by a cholera epidemic. During the January Uprising, Polish residents of the town supported the rebels, for which in 1869 Russian authorities stripped it of the town charter, and Goraj has remained a village ever since. 
Goraj was almost completely destroyed in World War I, and in the Second Polish Republic, it belonged to Lublin Voivodeship, as a poor village without prospects and industry. World War II brought further destruction, as Goraj was burned by the Germans twice - during the Zamosc Uprising (September 26, 1942), and in July 1944, during the Operation Tempest. As a result, there are few historic building in the village, with the exception of the parish church (1779-1782), its bell tower (1782), and two 18th century wooden houses.
Notable residents.
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Morgensztern, famed as the Kotsker Rebbe, was born in Goraj.

Beaverton Valley Times

The Beaverton Valley Times, also known as the Valley Times, is a weekly newspaper covering the city of Beaverton, Oregon, United States, and adjacent unincorporated areas. Owned since 2000 by the Pamplin Media Group, the paper was established in 1921. Currently based in neighboring Portland, the "Valley Times" is printed each Thursday and as of 2013 has a paid circulation of 3,857.
History.
What is today the "Beaverton Valley Times" was established in 1951 as The Valley News, with the consolidation of four local newspapers, the "Aloha News", "Beaverton Enterprise", "Multnomah Press", and "Tigard Sentinel". However, the paper's owners have long used 1921 as the date of foundation, based on that being the year in which the owner of the four papers, H. H. Jeffries, acquired the "Multnomah Press". Jeffries launched the "Sentinel" in 1924 and the "Aloha News" and "Beaverton Enterprise" in 1927. He later sold the group of four papers to Stan Netherton. Meanwhile, another newspaper being published separately in the area was the "Beaverton Review", which was launched in 1922, but ceased publication in 1941.
The four jointly owned newspapers were consolidated into a single paper, "The Valley News", after Netherton sold them to Ivan Smith and H.D. and Dan Powell, in early 1951. Not long afterward, in late 1951, the "Valley News" was sold to Hugh McGilvra and Elbert Hawkins, with George Hoyt joining them later as co-owner. As of 1951, the paper had fewer than 2,000 paid subscribers and averaged 12–16 pages per issue.
On September 6, 1962, "The Valley News" was renamed The Valley Times (OCLC number 30759134). By that time, the "Tigard Times", which had begun publication in February 1957 (as a weekly, subscription paper), and the "Washington County News-Times" of Forest Grove were affiliated or jointly owned, and the renaming of the "Valley News" as the "Times" was intended to publicize that relationship. The publishing company's name at that time was Valley Publishing, Inc. Circulation surpassed 10,000 in 1967.
Publisher Hugh Edward McGilvra sold the newspaper in 1981 to the owners of Eugene’s "Register-Guard". In January 1989, "Beaverton" was added to the paper's name, making it The Beaverton Valley Times. As of 1989, the paper's circulation was in excess of 8,000.
The paper won a first-place prize for its size category in 1992 for general excellence from the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association. In 1996, along with five other area newspapers, the "Valley Times" was sold to Steve and Randalyn Clark. In 1997, the paper took first place in its division at the annual Better Newspaper Contest of the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association. In July 2000, the "Valley Times" was honored by the same organization for excellence. Community Newspapers Inc. sold the newspaper along with several others in the Portland metropolitan area to Pamplin Media Group in August 2000.
By 2003, the paper began printing announcements for same-sex couples' commitment ceremonies. As of 2005, it was the largest weekly newspaper in Oregon. As of 2008, the publisher is Steven J. Clark. "The Oregonian" announced plans to launch a competing paper, the "Beaverton Leader", in March 2013.

During the 1961 season, Leahy played a total of 17 matches – two with his older brother, John (Rounds 12 and 13) – and received two votes for the Brownlow Medal. He played another 17 matches in 1962, including the Semi-Final loss to Carlton and received another Brownlow Medal vote.
Leahy played a total of 18 games during the 1963 season and kicked his first VFL goal during the Round 7 loss to South Melbourne. In 1964 he kicked his second goal against South Melbourne (Round 11) before a thigh injury cost him another premiership.
A torn achilles tendon the following season ultimately ended Leahy's VFL career – he played only one game in 1965 – the Round 16 loss to Geelong.
Leahy finished his career in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) where he played briefly with both Yarraville and Northcote. He then coached South Melbourne's Under-19s football team.
Later life.
Brian Leahy died in Wodonga on 24 January 2004 and is buried at the Glenmorous Gardens Lawn Cemetery, Albury.

David Cronenberg's Wife

David Cronenberg's Wife is a London-based band. 
Described as "where genius meets idiocy" by BBC Radio 2's Mark Lamarr, the band's lyrics combine dark subject matter (anorexia, murder, rape) with an off-kilter humour. They released their first single "I Couldn't Get Off" in 2007, followed up by two singles and their first album "Bluebeard's Rooms" in 2008. The album was recorded by Simon Trought (formerly of Tompaulin and Hayman, Watkins, Trout and Lee) and Dot Allison guitarist Ian Button (formerly of the Thrashing Doves and Death in Vegas) and was described in "The Fly" as "one of the albums of the year". Other reviews, however, were more critical of the album's dark subject matter and "repugnant imagery".
In August 2009, the band released their fourth single "The Fight Song" and played a second session on Marc Riley's 6Music show. This was followed by an appearance on Cerys Matthews' show, also on 6music, in October. 
Second album "Hypnagogues" was released in November 2009, with a noticeably more personal feel to the lyrics and a less harsh sound, even approaching alt.country on some of the tracks. The NME called it "a promising work in progress" with Drowned in Sound naming opening song "Sweden" (the band's sixth single) "one of the tracks of the year", adding that "it stands so far out from the rest that it encumbers the rest of the album."
Their third album "Don't Wait to be Hunted to Hide" was released in December 2012 and features some of the band's most controversial songs, such as the album's first single "Spiked" which describes a date-rape from the attacker's point of view. The album's themes caused one reviewer to call it the "most truly controversial I’ve heard all year", adding that it may "upset and unsettle" some listeners. In December 2012, the band supported The Fall at the Islington Assembly Hall. 
Band members are currently singer & songwriter Tom Mayne, keyboard player and bassist Rhian Tucker, lead guitarist Chris Potter, drummer Stuart Saunderson, violin player and guitarist Thomas Alder and bassist Ian Button.

British Cattle Movement Service

The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) is the organisation responsible for maintaining a database of all bovine animals in the United Kingdom, except for Northern Ireland, which has a separate database maintained by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. It was established in the wake of the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis in the UK, and is part of the Rural Payments Agency. Other member states of the European Union have similar cattle tracing systems.
Every bovine animal in the United Kingdom (as elsewhere in the European Union) has a unique number, shown both on an ear tag in each ear and on a paper cattle passport which is held by the current keeper of the animal (the system covers both cattle and other bovine animals such as water buffalo and bison). The number and passport remain with the animal throughout its life, and is recorded by the slaughterhouse at its death, allowing traceability of the beef. The BCMS central database is called the Cattle Tracing System, and works alongside the physical passport to record the births, deaths and movements of all cattle.
Cattle Tracing System.
The Cattle Tracing System (CTS) is the database for all cattle in Great Britain (Northern Ireland has a separate tracing system), to which farmers must notify births, movements and deaths of cattle on their holding. The system was introduced on 28 September 1998 in order to meet EU legislation requiring all member states to have a computerised tracing system by the end of 1999. There are currently four ways to notify CTS about births/movements/deaths including via the postal service using movement cards (cheque-book style passports only) and passport applications, over the telephone using the CTS Self-Service Line, over the internet using the CTS Online service or through third party software using CTS Web Services.
Cattle passport.
The cattle passport has taken three forms.
Each change only affected new issues of passports, leaving the old passports in circulation and maintaining former reporting methods for them. Replacement passports (for example in case of loss or amendment) are in the format which is current at the time of re-issue.
When an animal dies, the date of death is entered in the passport and this is returned to BCMS. The death may also be notified electronically.
If the rules for animal registration (and thus animal traceability) are not followed correctly, a passport will not be issued (this is most commonly where the deadline for calf registration is missed, of 28 days from birth). Instead the animal will receive an A4 "Notice of Registration" document (similar to the Certificate of CTS Registration), and its details will be held on the CTS. Such an animal may be used for breeding, but it may not enter the human food chain and it may not normally move between holdings except to slaughter.
Ear tag number.
Every bovine animal in the EU must have an ear tag in each ear: a "primary tag", which must be a large yellow plastic tag, and a "secondary tag", which may be similar to the primary, or it may be a smaller yellow plastic tag or a metal clip. Each tag must have the cattle passport number printed or stamped upon it, and it may also have a RFID chip bearing the same number in electronic form.
The British ear tag and passport number is in the format "UK HHHHHH CNNNNN" – this has been in use since 2002, before which other formats were used. The current format breaks down as follows:
Numbering example: If a herd had the number "123456", its first three calves might have the numbers:
The check digit highlights most errors in reading or recording the sequential number. A single-figure error in the sequential number will not match the check digit, unless it happens to produce a figure differing by a multiple of seven (for example, "600016" would have to be misread as "600086", or "500010" as "500080"). Double errors in both the sequential number and the check digit are also unlikely to produce genuine animal numbers. An error in the herd number might generate the herd number for another herd, and thus the number of an animal in that herd. However, the check digit for the first calf varies between herds, so only if the other herd happened to share the same check digit for the first calf would a whole apparently genuine animal number be produced.
Similar numbering is used for sheep and goats, with the omission of the check digit (and there is no individual paper passport). The number assigned to a sheep and goat flock is usually (but not always) the same six-figure number as that assigned to a cattle herd on the same farm.
For tags supplied in NI: the letters “UK” followed by the unique lifetime identification number consisting of the digit “9” followed by the herd number (3 to 6 digits in length), the individual animal code (1 to 4 digits in length) and a check digit (1 digit in length), each number group separated from the previous group by a space.
Check Digit.
The check digit for a cow’s ear tag is calculated by dividing the number obtained from the herd mark and animal number by 7 and adding one to the remainder. Take UK herd number 303565 cow number 01234. We work out the check digit as follows:

Salvatore Fisichella

Salvatore Fisichella (born May 15, 1943 in Catania, Sicily) is an Italian operatic tenor known for his roles in bel canto operas, especially those of Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini. He has been recognized for the ease and vocal brilliance of his singing, and for having sung more of the leading roles in Bellini's operas than any other 20th century tenor.
Early years.
Fisichella began singing as a child at family get-togethers. He was interested in church music by the age of ten, and was schooled in music at the local seminary. He sang solos in church services and during small-scale musical productions for special occasions and festivals. 
After leaving the seminary, Fisichella began secondary education, first at the liceo scientifico to study a science-based curriculum, then moving to study as a surveyor. During this time, he gave little serious thought to singing and his performances were limited to romanze and singsongs with friends and schoolmates. After he had successfully completed his secondary studies as a qualified surveyor, Fisichella was invited to the wedding of a client for whom he had drawn up the plans of his new home, and Fisichella filled in for the tenor who had been scheduled to perform.
Vocal training.
At that time, Catania was home to a number of good singing teachers and Fisichella chose one who was considered to be both costly and demanding. Maria Gentile, the renowned Catanese soprano, set Fisichella to work for six years. During this time Fisichella listened to Mario del Monaco, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Franco Corelli, Carlo Bergonzi and Gianni Raimondi. At this time he began performing in small concerts arranged by Gentile.
After studying under Maria Gentile, Fisichella studied further in Rome under Ricci and Paoletti.
Operatic career.
1970s.
Fisichella won the XXIV Concorso Lirico Adriano Belli - the prestigious competition held in Spoleto, for his performances of the opera pieces "I puritani", "La favorite" and "Rigoletto". Prior to touring all of Italy, Spoleto was also the venue for Fisichella's debut performance in the leading role of Massenet's "Werther" conducted by Ottavio Ziino. 
In 1971 Fisichella was engaged by the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma for two performances of "Rigoletto" and no less than seven performances of "I puritani" conducted by Armando La Rosa Parodi with Mirella Freni and Cornell MacNeil. In the same year, he also performed at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo alongside Leyla Gencer in "Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra" conducted by Gianandrea Gavazzeni. A year later, he was called upon again by the Opera di Roma, this time to work with Mirella Freni and Ghiaurov in Gounoud's "Faust" conducted by George Pretre. In April 1973 he debuted at the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, working with Lidia Marimpietri in a production of "La bohème" conducted by Zoltan Pesko. 
In 1973, Fisichella took part in "Elisa e Claudio" at the Festival Mercadantiano in Altamura. In Pesaro in 1975, he sang in Rossini's "Messa di Gloria", a score avoided by many of the bel canto elite.
1980s.
In 1983, he performed in a production of "La bohème" with Katia Ricciarelli. In 1984, he sang with Buna Baglioni, Giorgio Zancanaro and Bonaldo Giaiotti at the State Theatre of Bern in Donizetti's "La favorite" conducted by Nello Santi. On this occasion, the critic of Der Bund described Fisichella as "currently the best tenor singer of the Donizetti and Bellini repertoire". It was around this time that Fisichella began to collaborate with Nello Santi, the maestro who would encourage the tenor to take up the challenging roles of "I puritani", "La Gioconda", "Guglielmo Tell", "La nuit de mai", "Rigoletto", "Il pirata", and the "Messa di Requiem". In the same year, Fisichella performed Rossini's "Stabat Mater" at the Konzerthaus in Vienna. In 1985, he once again played Arturo in "I puritani" (this time singing alongside the soprano Edita Gruberova and baritone Giorgio Zancanaro, with the conductor Masini at the Bregenz Festival. Dortmund also saw him play Arturo. Again in 1985, Fisichella performed for the Radio Berlin concert to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Vincenzo Bellini's death.
In November 1986, Fisichella performed the role of Arturo in "I puritani" at his Metropolitan Opera debut in New York, together with the soprano Joan Sutherland. The performance created a stir among the New York press.
1990s.
Fisichella's vocal range, flexibility and incisive phrasing have led the singer to branch out beyond the bel canto repertoire into verismo, as, for example, in his 1988 performance of "La Gioconda" at the inauguration of the Teatro Regio di Torino. He performed the role of Mario Cavaradossi in "Tosca" at the XXXVI Puccini Festival in the summer of 1990.
Fisichella was one of the performers at the Megaconcert held in Verona Arena (Concert of Tenors) to commemorate the centenary of Beniamino Gigli's birth, (Corriere della Sera 29/8/1990). He was seen playing the role of Edgardo in "Lucia di Lammermoor" at La Scala in Milan in May 1992.
In 1995, Fisichella performed in the production of Bellini's "La favorite" broadcast live on Italian National Radio. He performed together with Leo Nucci in "Rigoletto" at the Zurich Opera House, as conducted by Nello Santi. The production was later taken to the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. Together with Katia Ricciarelli, Fisichella was invited to the closing concert of the Homage to Pietro Mascagni celebrations organised in Vizzini to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Mascagni's death. The concert took place against the natural backdrop to "Cavalleria Rusticana".
He performed Verdi's "Requiem" in Solingen with The MGV Wupperhorf Choir 1812, of which he is an honorary member. On this occasion, Fisichella performed together with Rybarska, Baglioni, and Nesterenko and the concert was recorded on CD.
In 1996, Fisichella returned to Tokyo for a production of "La traviata" with June Anderson. The same year saw him perform in Mario Monicelli's centenary production of "La bohème" at the 42nd Puccini Festival in Torre del Lago. 
Fisichella performed three concerts of Verdi's "Requiem" conducted by Nello Santi at the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona and the Teatro Sociale in Mantua. In 1997 he returned to the Zurich Opernhaus to perform "Rigoletto", alternating with Nucci and Zancanaro.
On the occasion of the inaugural concerts for the newly restored Teatro Massimo in Palermo, he performed together with Gasdia, Casolla, and Peterson in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony conducted by Neschling. He sang again with Nucci in "La traviata" and the "Requiem Mass" at the III Festival d’Opera d’Avence. At the VII Classical Open Air Festival in Solothurn, he performed with Nucci both in "La bohème" and "Rigoletto". Another engagement followed at "Verona's Teatro Filarmonico" where he sang the challenging piece by Verdi - "Inno delle nazioni", conducted by Maurizio Arena. 
At the Cathedral of Catania he performed Geremia's unpublished "Missa Pro Defunctis 1809" and Bellini's "Messa Seconda in G minor" with Katia Ricciarelli. The concert was conducted by Douglas Bostock, and was recorded for Classico records. In 1998, Fisichella was again to sing with Katia Ricciarelli, this time performing in three large-scale New Year's concerts organised by the Sicilian Regional Authorities. He also performed in Teatro Massimo Bellini's production of "Rigoletto" in Catania (with Nucci and Pace, conducted by Nello Santi) and in the "Concerto Dei Grandi Tenori Siciliani" organised by the same theatre. This was the period in which Fisichella was presented with the Gigli D’Oro award at the second "Una vita per la Musica" event held in Recanati, the native town of the tenor himself. In 1999, Fisichella was once again invited to perform at the Puccini Festival in a production of "La bohème". The same year saw Fisichella, together with two fellow performers, in a memorable open air "Concerto Sotto Le Stelle" in Recanati, singing in the same square where Gigli had so often entertained his home public.
2000s.
In Johnstown (Pittsburgh, U.S.A.), Fisichella received a welcome in the awaited annual concerto-festival at the Pasquarilla Center. 2000 continued with performances of "Macbeth" at the Teatro Massimo in Catania, "Madame Butterfly" at the Puccini Festival, and a production of "La bohème" at the Den Norske Opera in Oslo.
Fisichella opened the new millennium with two concerts in Beijing, one on New Year's Eve, the other on New Years’ Day. On this occasion, he had the honour of being the only European singer invited to perform with the three largest choirs and orchestras of China.

Voice.
Fisichella has a full lyric tenor voice. Following a brief outline of Fisichella's career, the "Dictionary of Opera" by Harold Rosenthal and John Warrack, concludes that Fisichella's is "...a voice that has remained intact after 25 years of singing, quite simply the most lovely tone of the Italian tenors of our day."

Samuel Rush Meyrick

Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick (16 August 1783–1848) was an English collector. He lived at Goodrich Court, Goodrich, Herefordshire, England, and introduced the systematic study of arms and armour.
Life.
He was born in 1783 to John and Hannah Meyrick. His father had been an officer in the Honourable Artillery Company and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was educated at Queens College, Oxford, graduating with a BA in 1804, with a MA/Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) in 1810 and finally with a Doctor in Civil Law (DCL) in 1811. He practiced as an advocate in ecclesiastical and admiralty courts.
In 1803 Samuel eloped to Wales with Mary Parry against the wishes of his parents and was cut out of his father’s will and forced to live on a small allowance. When his father died in 1805 he left his estate to Samuel’s son Llewellyn.
Samuel did inherit from his father his passion for collecting antiquities including arms and armour and was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquities in 1810. During this same year he published "History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan".
After the death of his wife in 1818 he concentrated on building the Meyrick collection by a series of acquisitions of other collections.
In 1824 he published his great work, the 3 volume "A critical enquiry into antient armour as it existed in Europe, but particularly in England, from the Norman conquest to the reign of King Charles II, with a glossary of military terms of the middle ages". The book was illustrated in colour with Samuel’s paintings, was beautifully gilded, and solidified his reputation as an authority in the study of arms and armour. With the publication of this book Samuel hoped to rectify some historical inaccuracies that found their way to the displays of armour in the Tower of London and other collections.
In 1828 he built Goodrich Court, having failed to acquire nearby Goodrich Castle. There the Meyrick collection was housed in a huge armoury. After helping to reorganise the collections at the Tower of London and Windsor Castle he was knighted in 1832. In 1834 he was appointed High Sheriff of Herefordshire. In 1837 Llewellyn died and Samuel inherited his estate, providing the funds for yet more collection building.
Legacy.
After Meyrick's death in 1848, Goodrich Court and the Meyrick collection passed to his cousin Augustus Meyrick, who exhibited the collection in 1869 at what is now the Victoria and Albert museum. He disposed of the collection to a number of private purchasers after first offering it to the British Government, as well as donating some objects to the British Museum. Many of the important items in Meyrick's collection were purchased by the antiquarian, Augustus Wollaston Franks, who later also donated them to the British Museum. Some of the best pieces of his collection can also be found in the Wallace Collection in London.
Collection.
Meyrick's collection of arms and armour included the following pieces:

Churchill Island is a island in Western Port, Victoria, Australia. It is connected by a bridge to Phillip Island. It is the site of the first European settlement in Victoria. It contains a working farm and a homestead, dating from 1872, which is open to the public. The island adjoins the Churchill Island Marine National Park. The island is maintained by Parks Victoria.
History.
Churchill Island was first charted by Europeans in 1798 when George Bass and Matthew Flinders discovered the bay of Western Port and Phillip Island. In 1801, during the course of a survey of Western Port, Lieutenant James Grant built a cottage on the island, felled trees and planted seeds of wheat and corn there, naming the island for his friend John Churchill, who supplied the seeds.
This was the first European agricultural farm in Victoria. Samuel Amess, a former mayor of Melbourne, purchased the island in 1872 and built the substantial home that still stands today.
From an Indigenous culture perspective Aboriginal middens and the remains of stone foundations are also preserved as the area of Western Port surrounding the island is listed under the Ramsar Convention.
Churchill Island and the area around it served as the location for the 1977 Australian film "Summerfield".

<doc id="18474291" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18474291" title="Covered warrant">
Covered warrant

In finance a covered warrant (sometimes called naked warrant) is a type of warrant that has been issued without an accompanying bond or equity. Like a normal warrant it allows the holder to buy or sell a specific amount of equities, currency or other financial instruments from the issuer at a specified price at a predetermined date. 
Unlike normal warrants they are usually issued by financial institutions instead of share issuing companies and are listed as full tradeable securities on a number of stock exchanges. They can also have a wide variety of underlying instruments, not just equities and may allow the holder to both buy or sell the underlying asset. These attributes make it possible to use covered warrants as a tool to speculate on financial markets.
Structure and features.
A covered warrant gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy ('call' warrant) or to sell ('put' warrant) an underlying asset at a specified price (the 'strike' price or 'exercise' price) by a predetermined date. The price paid for this right is the 'premium' and with covered warrants you cannot lose more than this initial premium paid. They are limited liability instruments so there are no further payments or margin calls required to maintain a covered warrant position. Covered warrants offer a flexible alternative to private investors who seek to gain the leverage benefits of derivatives, but who wish to limit their risk.
When the issuer sells a warrant to an investor, they typically 'cover' (hedge) their exposure by buying the underlying instrument in the market. Covered warrants have an average life of six to 12 months, although some have maturities of several years.
In contrast to 'traditional' equity warrants, with covered warrants no new issuance of common stock occurs if the warrant is exercised. The underlying shares of common stock are usually either owned by the issuer of the covered warrants or the issuer has a mechanism, such as owning equity warrants for the underlying shares, through which they can obtain the shares. Covered warrants have proved highly popular due to their:
Comparison with options.
Covered warrants are very similar to options, much more so than 'traditional' warrants. This is because covered warrants, just like options, can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both put and call warrants. They can also be created on a wide variety of underlying instruments not just equities and there are fairly standardised and are mostly traded on exchanges. The main difference is that warrants tend to have longer maturity dates typically measured in years instead of months as with options, and are easier to access for individuals as they can be bought and sold in the same way as shares in the stock exchange.
Trading warrants.
Warrants are listed on a number of major exchanges, including the London Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and have proved popular with individual investors and traders particularly in Hong Kong, China and Europe (especially Italy) . They are seen as a flexible tool offering leveraged exposure to a wide range of underlyings such as equities, baskets, indices, currencies and commodities, while offering the benefits of transparency and liquidity.
For example, popular indices include the FTSE100 in the UK or DAX in Germany, and popular commodities include oil, gold and wheat.
Risks.
The main exposure is to Market risk as the warrant will be profitable only when the market price exceeds the strike price for a 'call warrant' or is below the strike for a 'put warrant'. The inherent leveraging effect of the warrant significantly increases the risks and traders that are using warrant to speculate can make or lose significant sums very quickly. With covered warrants the maximum loss is limited to the price paid for the warrant (ask or offer price) plus any commission or other transaction charges. Thus, although warrants are classed as high risk they are not as risky as other investment products such as contracts for differences or spread betting in which an investor would have to pay for future losses.
Another aspect of risk is that an investor could lose their entire investment if the corporation issuing the warrant becomes insolvent.

The 2009 St. George Illawarra Dragons season was 11th in the joint venture Rugby League club's history. They competed in the NRL's 2009 Telstra Premiership under new coach Wayne Bennett and finished the season as minor premiers. However a series of losses late in the season saw them become the first minor premiers to bow out of the McIntyre System with two consecutive losses in the finals.
Season Summary.
Coming off a 2008 Qualifying Final loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and with a new Coach in the office being Wayne Bennett, the Dragons signed a number of new players but lost just as many. The Dragons were hoping to improve the previous years Qualifying Final loss, by making it even further this year. Five Toyota Cup players of 2008 have been promoted to the First Grade squad with more talented juniors rising through the ranks within the club.
St. George led the competition in defence in 2009 and finished the season with the minor premiership, the club's first. Their strong performance also led to new records for home match attendances at WIN Jubilee Oval.
St George exited the finals series in the second week of the finals.

The Slave-girl from Jerusalem

The Slave-girl from Jerusalem is a children's historical novel by Caroline Lawrence. The novel, the thirteenth in the Roman Mysteries series, was published in 2007. It is set in December AD 80 in and around Ostia, and deals with death, slavery and the Roman legal system.
Plot summary.
Jonathan's sister, Miriam, is approached by Hepzibah, a girlhood friend from Jerusalem. Hepzibah is in serious trouble. Formerly a slave owned by the wealthy landowner Dives, she claims that she was manumitted (set free), but Dives has just died, and his heir, Nonius Celer, says he has no proof of her freedom and insists on keeping her as part of the estate.
Miriam asks Flavia, Jonathan, Nubia, and Lupus, to help prove Hepzibah is free. But they have barely started investigating when the town is upset by a series of murders: first, Papillio, one of the town Decurions, and then Mercutor, a freedman on Dives's (now Celer's) estate.
Before long, Celer brings charges against Hepzibah for murder. His theory is that the Decurion would have confirmed that she was never set free; and the freedman must have suspected that Dives didn't die of natural causes – Hepzibah killed him. She had a motive: Dives was a soldier (as was Celer's father) in the legions that sacked Jerusalem during the Great Revolt.
Hepzibah is tried in the basilica; the children's old friend Pliny offers to help, but withdraws quickly when Celer retains the legendary orator Quintilian to present his case. The children turn to their other friend, aspiring lawyer Gaius Valerius Flaccus (or, as Flavia calls him, "Floppy").
During the first day in court, however, things do not go well; Quintilian is polished and smooth, while Flaccus's speech comes off as rehearsed and insincere. The evidence against Hepzibah is strong: witnesses say that Dives wanted to marry her, but she ran away, screaming that she hated him. Hepzibah is forced to admit this is true. Moreover, the two murder victims were killed by someone unfamiliar with a sword, most likely a woman.
Even worse, the children's old ally, local magistrate Marcus Artorius Bato, appears as a witness for Celer, and does everything possible to slander Hepzibah and her friends, including the children and every member of their family. Elsewhere, Celer's agents have been digging up dirt against the children to discourage them from helping Hepzibah, and Nubia is forced to go into hiding when it is revealed that her own manumission was not legally completed.
Before he died, Papillio managed to whisper a clue to Nubia to "find the other six." At first, Flavia believes that this is a reference to the siege of Masada, of which there were only seven survivors, including Hepzibah. But then she realizes that, under Roman law, a will requires seven witnesses. The two murder victims must have been witnesses to Dives's real will, and they have to find the other five.
On the second day, Flaccus rallies and gives a riveting oration, while Lupus and Jonathan search the town for the real will. But in the middle of the trial, Flavia solves the case, and whispers the solution to Flaccus, who is so overjoyed that he kisses her in full view of the gallery.
What really happened was: Celer knew he had been cut out of Dives's will, so he killed Dives and forged a will, then tried to eliminate the seven witnesses to the real will. Hepzibah had to be silenced, because Celer suspected that she might be one of the seven, or even that Dives's real will left the estate to her.
The proof? Flavia realizes that the wounds on Papillio and Mercutor's bodies show that they were both killed by a left-handed man – which also explains the killer's unfamiliarity with a sword, since left-handed men are not allowed to serve in the Roman army. Flaccus demonstrates, then points out that Celer is left-handed.
For the finale, Lupus and Jonathan deliver the copy of Dives's real will, which Flaccus reads aloud to confirm that Celer had a motive: 
The will also names the seven witnesses to it, including the murdered men.
Trapped, Celer confesses, but angrily says that he had a better claim to the estate than anyone else: Dives built his fortune using a relic looted from the Temple of Jerusalem; Celer's father saved Dives's life, at the cost of his own, when they were both trapped by a fire in the Temple; in exchange, Dives promised to make the elder Celer's family his heirs, but selfishly changed his mind later.
Hepzibah is acquitted, and several citizens step forward to bring suit against Celer, thereby almost having him arrested. It is revealed that Bato received a large sum of money from Celer in exchange for his testimony. Quintilian, impressed by Flaccus's speech (and not at all abashed at having represented a murderer in court) offers Flaccus an apprenticeship with him in Rome.
But the novel ends in an anticlimax: Miriam dies in childbirth when she was only fifteen, giving birth to her twin sons.
Continuity.
The events of the novel are mentioned in the collection "Trimalcho's Feast" in the short story "Death by Vespasian", which takes the form of a letter from Bato to the Emperor.
Themes.
Death.
Death is a major theme in the novel:
Roman Law.
The book illustrates several unique aspects of the legal system in Ancient Rome:
Characters.
Both the villain, Celer, and the primary victim, Dives, are presented as somewhat ambivalent. Celer is a cold-blooded murderer, who kills out of greed, but his motive becomes somewhat understandable when he reveals Dives' own selfishness.
The deceased Dives is portrayed as genuinely regretful of his past actions, and as trying to make up for it by leaving his property to Hepzibah, to his Jewish slaves, and to the synagogue. Yet at the same time, he built his fortune by stealing a religious artifact, and at the cost of his comrade's life. Also, his guilt appears less noble when it is mixed with desire, even lust, for Hepzibah.
He is also portrayed as a hypocrite: in his will, he claims to despise his clique of fortune hunters and gives them a mocking goodbye; yet he was happy to receive their attention while he was alive, and so kept his real will a secret. Had he not done so, he might never have been murdered, which allowed Celer to produce the forgery as genuine.
TV Adaptation.
"The Slave-girl From Jerusalem" was the last novel adapted for the television series.

Roger Edward Kuntz

Roger Edward Kuntz (January 4, 1926 – August 22, 1975) was a highly accomplished Southern California landscape painter and a member of the Claremont Group of painters - professors and graduates of Pomona College, Scripps College, and the Claremont Graduate School. A figurative artist with an eye for abstract form, he won critical acclaim for striking compositions that transform an unusual array of subjects, including tennis players, domestic interiors, freeways, road signs, bathtubs and the Goodyear Blimp. A retrospective exhibition of his work, at the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, CA in 2009, was aptly titled "Roger Kuntz: The Shadow Between Representation and Abstraction". In the exhibition catalogue, curator Susan M. Anderson wrote: "Kuntz's work of the late 1950s and early 1960s quintessentially embodied the experimentation, fragmentation, and paradox in American culture of the time."
Life and work.
Roger Kuntz was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1926, the second son of Helena Grace Towle Kuntz and Clyde Antoine Kuntz, a U.S. Army pilot whose father had emigrated from the Alsace-Lorraine area of France. Soon after Roger's birth, the family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where Clyde Kuntz died in a plane crash in 1929. His widow took their two young sons to California, moving from San Francisco to Riverside to Coronado and, finally, to Lomaland, home of the Theosophical Society's community of artists, writers and philosophers.
Roger Kuntz began drawing and painting in his youth. After graduating from Pt. Loma High School, in 1943, he enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont, CA. He dropped out for two years to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps and returned in 1946 to study art and psychology. Upon graduation, in 1948, Kuntz married fellow student Margaret Durr and enrolled at the Claremont Graduate School (now Claremont Graduate University). He studied with artists Henry Lee McFee, Millard Sheets, Sueo Serisawa and Carlos Lopez and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1950. His classmates included painters Paul Darrow, Douglas McClellan and Karl Benjamin and sculptor Jack Zajac.
Kuntz and his wife spent four months traveling in Europe in 1950 so that Roger could visit museums and develop ideas for paintings of European scenes. The couple's only child, Mary Margaret, was born in 1951. The family lived in the Claremont area until 1963, when they moved to Laguna Beach. 
Exhibition success came early to Kuntz, who won an honorable mention and cash prize at his first public showing, at the Pasadena Art Institute in 1948. By about 1950 Kuntz believed that post-war abstract expressionism had run its course and that the time was ripe for the reappearance of structure in art that communicated to the viewer. His first solo exhibition was held at the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego in 1951. Kuntz's work got wider exposure in the early 1950s in national competitions at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia and the National Academy of Design in New York. His first international exhibition was the III Bienal de São Paulo, which opened in Brazil in 1955 and subsequently traveled throughout the United States. 
In 1954, upon the recommendation of Sheets, Kuntz joined the faculty at Scripps College in Claremont as a visiting professor of art. Two years later, he received a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation grant for painting. The $3,000 award allowed him to take a leave of absence from teaching and work on his art full-time. Travels in California and Mexico inspired many of his paintings during that period. As his reputation grew, Kuntz joined the stable of artists represented by Felix Landau, a leading Los Angeles art dealer who maintained a prestigious gallery on La Cienega Boulevard. The relationship continued from 1957 to 1968.
As Kuntz matured, his paintings evolved from relatively traditional landscapes, still lifes and figure studies to much more reductive and dramatic views of freeway overpasses and underpasses, cropped highway signs, and signs carved in deep shadow and light; they embodied Kuntz's search for the union of formal abstraction and mundane reality. Produced from 1960 to 1962 in a palette generally limited to black, white, grays and greens, these paintings compose his most highly acclaimed body of work.
Though devoid of people and cars, the distinctive images portray a stark, man-made environment designed to transport Southern California's growing population at high speeds. In 1962 and 1963, Kuntz also built a series of aluminum sculptural constructions based on traffic signals. His original interpretation of California car culture captured the attention of critics and curators who viewed the work in the context of Pop art and Kuntz was included in the first national survey of Pop Art organized by John Coplans, editor of "Artforum" magazine, in 1963. But Kuntz's pensive, thoughtfully naturalistic sensibility had little in common with the brashness of Pop art luminaries, including Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol.
In the last decade of his life, when he painted a series of brooding images of figures in and around bathtubs and made a group of related bronze sculptures, it was clear that Kuntz was not a Pop artist. Following his own muse, he also painted tranquil studies of a young woman seated in front of a window, fanciful images of the Goodyear Blimp tethered on a runway or landing on the moon, and scenes of beaches and tennis courts. 
In 1962 "Life" magazine did a special issue on the state of California; it focused on five artists: Stanton Macdonald-Wright, John McLaughlin, Robert Irwin, Billy Al Bengston, and Roger Kuntz.
In the early 1970s, Kuntz was diagnosed with skin cancer. In 1975, at 49 years of age, he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, ending a painful period of depression and physical deterioration that had led to paralysis. 
Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, California, organized a major retrospective on the work of Roger Kuntz, which ran from March 8 to May 24, 2009. The exhibition, titled "The Shadow Between Representation and Abstraction," was the first major showing of the artist's work since his death. It focused on Kuntz's search for what he called the "middle ground" between figurative and non-figurative painting, and explored his role in the Southern California art scene of the 1950s and 1960s. The museum also published an exhibit catalog of the same name. "Roger Kuntz was no extremist, and that hurt his career", critic Peter Plagens wrote in the introduction to the catalogue of the artist's 2009 retrospective at the Laguna Art Museum. "In the brief time he was active as an artist in Southern California, from the mid 1950s until his suicide in 1975, the high modern art world encouraged---no, practically demanded---that an artist take sides." But Kuntz "tried to create something beautiful and significant by pursuing a middle path", Plagens wrote.
In a "Los Angeles Times" review of a 2012 exhibition of the "Freeway", "Sign" and "Blimp" series, at Louis Stern Fine Arts in West Hollywood, critic David Pagel wrote that Kuntz's paintings "conjure vast landscapes beyond their edges: both the endless sprawl of L.A.'s freeways and the unfathomable vastness of our interior worlds, which are filled with their own twists and turns, dead ends and exits, intersections and underpasses."

Vincenzo Chiarugi

Vincenzo Chiarugi (1759–1820) was an Italian physician who helped introduce humanitarian reforms to the psychiatric hospital care of people with mental disorders. His early part in a movement towards moral treatment was relatively overlooked until a gradual reassessment through the 20th century left his reforms described as a landmark in the history of psychiatry. He also specialized in dermatology and wrote on other subjects.
Career.
Vincenzo Chiarugi was born in Empoli, near Florence. He graduated from the medical school of Pisa in 1780, then moved to Florence to work at the Santa Maria Nuova hospital.
From 1785 to 1788, Chiarugi was director of the Santa Dorotea hospital in Florence, where he outlawed chains as a means of restraint for psychiatric patients. A prior attempt had been made there in the 1750s, but chains softened with canvas strips had been reintroduced.
In 1788, Chiarugi was appointed physician director ("primo infermiere") of the Bonifacio Hospital. Existing since the 14th century, a wing had been rebuilt along his plans, with the internal structure adapted to the specific needs of the patients. The hospital took in the mentally ill as well as invalids (who were typically poor, homeless and unemployed) and patients with skin conditions. Chiarugi was the chief author of new humanitarian regulations for the hospital that were introduced in 1789.
In 1793-1794 Chiarugi's main published psychiatric work, his three volume "On Insanity and Its Classification" ("Della Pazzìa in Genere e in Specie"), was published in Florence. He also published works on dermatology and agriculture, and a book about his home town.
In 1802 Chiarugi became professor of dermatology and mental diseases, and later professor of physiology, pathology, and "materia medica" at the medical school of Florence. He continued his work of reform and of teaching until his death in 1820.
Enlightenment context.
In Chiarugi's early career, the Italian state of Florence was ruled by Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo. He was a young man of the Enlightenment, keen to introduce wide-ranging social and economic reforms across Florence. This included an institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents, and the abolition of torture and the death penalty. Leopoldo also directed his attention to the mistreatment and neglect of the mentally ill, which was continuing despite progress in other areas of medicine and science. In 1774, the "legge sui pazzi" (law on the insane) was introduced, the first of its kind in Europe, allowing for steps to be taken to hospitalize individuals regarded as insane. A wing of the public hospital, the Bonifacio, was rebuilt for the purpose, and the young physician Chiarugi was put in charge.
Indeed, it was Leopold's government that published the new humanitarian regulations ('Regolamento'), covering both the Santa Maria Nuova hospital and the Bonofacio Hospital. Ten pages of the work concern psychiatric patients. Although Chiarugi shaped the guidelines, there is perhaps less justification for listing the work under his name. It also appears that Chiarugi was not alone in promoting psychiatric reform in Italy. There was a hospital in Florence run by the Brothers of Charity providing custodial care for the mentally ill, which Leopold had attempted to subordinate to the Santa Maria Nuova. In Naples, Antonio Sementini (1743 - 1814) instituted some reforms at the Holy Home for Incurables.
Clinical practices.
Chiarugi employed three major diagnostic categories from a classification scheme by William Cullen that was in common use at the time: melancholia, mania, and dementia (terms used differently from today). He saw these categories as distinct but fluid.
At the Bonifacio Hospital, he helped implement the new rules (Regolamento) covering the approach to custody and care, the conduct of all staff, and procedures for admissions and record-keeping. A detailed history was required for each patient admitted to the hospital. Men were separated from women. The rules have been described as bureaucratic and paternalistic in tone but expressing a novel concern for the welfare of the mentally ill. This can be seen in parts of the Regolomanto such as (294-376):
The patient is to be treated with respect; not put to work (with the exception that those accustomed to such work may be expected to help in cleaning); no physical pain to be inflicted under any circumstance—and the director shall be vigilantly observant of this; the application of restraints, often necessary in the treatment of mania, must be applied in accord with humanitarian and hygienic practices; patients are to have access to the grounds to walk, play, or exercise; they are to be bathed regularly, even if they must be tied down while this is being done; they will be fed in their closed rooms while observed through a small grated window; visiting by friends or family is extremely unwise—when it occurs, it must be closely supervised.
Chiarugi recommended cloth and leather restraints, partly strengthened with iron, applied in a way that prevented sores or lacerations. Ties and handcuffs that permitted mobility were preferred to straitjackets. In "On Insanity", he advised that patients with mania should be confined to a secure room without furniture or anything that could be dangerous, and with nothing too stimulating such as pictures, noise, light or items reminiscent of home. Although it was severely prohibited at the Bonifacio to beat patients, he advised that whipping around the waist could sometimes work for "arrogant" manic patients thought to be rational enough to be sedated by fear of it. Brief submersion in cold water was sometimes used, but not the usual practice of submersion to the point of near-drowning. He did not employ the practice of controlling patients by withdrawal of food to the point of near-starvation, but described different diets for different conditions.
Chiarugi used a diverse mixture of remedies and drugs in his treatments, principally opium. Some were intended to be sedatives and some mild stimulants, the latter including irritants and blistering agents applied to the skin. He also employed hydrotherapy and, to a lesser extent, bloodletting. Psychological techniques were used and were also intended to be either sedative (e.g. dark rooms away from noise or heat, tender and sad music) or mildly stimulating (e.g. physical or mental exercise, cheerful companionship, joyful music). Chiarugi argued that a therapist must become: 
patron of their hearts, capture their confidence and trust. order to drive away their false impressions and cause diverse passions to be born, and even if possible contrary passions. The therapist must conduct himself in a philosophical manner, displaying sensitivity and delicacy and prudence beyond the ordinary. He should refrain from opposing the mad ideas, as the ordinary person might do, with unconcealed animosity, menace or blows. Such tactics disturb these unfortunates and enhance their stubborn adherence to their delusions. To the contrary, one must guide them to the understanding of what is true by kindness (dolcezza), by indirect means, instilling reason drop by drop. The therapist must provide them with the material most appropriate to raise the mask from erroneous beliefs, to show them the truth almost by a process of inductive logic (from Della Pazzia, II 67–68).
Chiarugi also advised: 
Keep that melancholic who is single mindedly concerned with his hatred for a particular person isolated from the sight and the memory of that person. Have him go on voyages where he will have the opportunity to converse with wise and genial companions, which will distract him from his preoccupations and allow new ideas and concerns to enter his mind. Should the preoccupation be with loss of or the unavailability of a love object, that person should be put in the most unfavorable light, by emphasizing the defects of the loved one, as Ovid advised. Or prudently find a new love for him, not precipitously, but gradually so as to not turn his melancholia into mania. Turn his constricting sadness and timidity into the livelier emotion, into the intense affect of fear. This can be done by taking him by surprise with the manforte [literally, a support; a crook or crutch-like implement and with it drag him to a seclusion room" (from Della Pazzia II, p74).
For suicidal patients, Chiarugi advised the use of religious arguments for the value of life. For delusions, he advised using the delusion against itself, for example: "Should he have the delusion that "he must vomit to rid his stomach of frogs, give him an emetic and have one of the assistants artfully place frogs in the basin into which the patient vomits. By such and similar means the melancholic's errors may be combated with their own weapons!" (from Della Pazzia II, p 68–69). For delusions of grandeur, patients "swollen with pride, with fancies of great wealth and power", Chiarugi recommended disparagement and humiliation, showing the patient evidence of their fallibility. For mania, he focused on ensuring the safety of patients and staff, and seeking to contain and calm the patient.
Restraints were used on patients at night, which Chiarugi justified on the basis of staffing shortages.
Theoretical assumptions.
The most prominent theoretical perspective in Chiarugi's published writing is neurological, merged with philosophical perspectives on brain, mind and soul that were consistent with Catholic theory. He argued that moral (i.e. psychological) or physical forces disrupted the internal workings of the nervous system. He wrote of an interplay between passions (which could be too extreme or prolonged), reasoning (which could become faulty) and the brain. He conceived of neural functioning as involving force and, in a hydrodynamic sense, fluids. Blood flow to the brain was thought to add to neural fluid pressure. He conceived of disorder as either involving over-excitement or under-excitement of the brain and nervous system. Signs of the former, such as heightened altertness, pulse and appetite, indicated the need for sedation; signs of the latter indicated the need for stimulation. He argued that the soul of a person was perfect even if the mind was led astray due to its close integration with the brain. He examined post-mortem brains of patients and claimed to observe some pathological abnormalities, arguing that others might not be visible to the naked eye.
Overall, Chiarugi's treatise on insanity and its classification has been described as learned - drawing on over 50 ancient, German, Swiss, French, British and Italian texts - but narrowly traditional in content and perspective. He did not mention at all the work of John Locke, whose associationist ideas were controversial with Catholic doctrine at the time. It is said that he did not enable a full psychological understanding of the clinical issues shown by patients.
Recognition.
Chiarugi was known in Italy for his psychiatric theories and teaching more than for his humanitarian approach. His publications on mental illness were not widely translated or disseminated elsewhere, although the first volume of "On Insanity" was translated into German. 
Chiarugi did not enjoy the renown bestowed on Philippe Pinel, a French psychiatrist who introduced similar reforms several years after Chiarugi. It has been suggested this was partly because late 18th century revolutionary France received greater attention. In addition, the support Chiarugi had enjoyed from the state of Florence faded, and he had no natural successor to continue to develop and publicise his work, by contrast to Pinel in France and William Tuke in England. It has also been noted that while Pinel expressed empathy and admiration for his patients and enlivened his work with individual case material, Chiarugi's writing, while never disdaining the mentally ill, did not highlight his humanitarian reforms and was characterized by a benign impersonality. 
Following the building of a new psychiatric hospital at the end of the 19th century, the Bonifacio was turned into a hospital for other conditions, then an education office, and since 1938 it has been the site of the police headquarters in Florence, Tuscany.[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/place/ExOspedaleBonifazio.html] 
Through the 20th century there was a slow re-evaluation of Chiarugi's contributions. Further translations were made of his psychiatric work. Original language versions were republished in Italy. He became recognised as an early contributor to a movement that became known as moral treatment and his work said to "constitute a major landmark in the history of psychiatry".
The main importance of the Regolamento may be that it helped establish the mental patient as a 'modern public person'.

Shellfish Association of Great Britain

The Shellfish Association of Great Britain (SAGB) is a historic association that was founded as the Oyster Merchants’ and Planters’ Association in 1903, it was renamed the SAGB in 1969. They cover a wide range of topics within the shellfish industry, from trading to advice on nutritional standards and also the sustainability of the industry.
History And Role.
The SAGB is the Shellfish industry’s trade body with the director and staff based at Fishmongers’ Hall which is also home to the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and can be found in the City of London. The SAGB consists of a wide range of members located within the Shellfish farming and fishing industry, within commercial companies and traders of Shellfish products, the Seafish Industry Authority and the major Sea Fisheries Committees. Gradually the range of species marketed and the number of activities covered by the SAGB have extended over its 105 years of service to the industry (updated 17 July 2008).
The association provides support on various topics of interest to the UK Shellfish industry, which is part of a valuable constituent in the UK economy. The SAGB also gives technical advice and mediates in a range of environmental issues ranging from coastal pollution, aggregate dredging and stock conservation. Furthermore they maintain a working relationship with important conservation agencies: Natural England (NE), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Northern Ireland - Environment & Heritage Service. Additional conservation organizations include: The Marine Conservation Society, RSPB and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Amongst other bodies associated with the SAGB are the Marine Stewardship Council and Coastnet. In summary the SAGB promote the sustainable development of the UK shellfish industry having always given advice on various topical issues and helped provide members with information about new technical advances in the industry or changes in legislation and the market.
Objectives.
Public Health & Shellfish.
The SAGB's first priority has been to ensure shellfish safety for human consumption. The association took a leading role in advising on standards when the European Commission(EC) drew up the Bivalve Shellfish Hygiene Directive and Fishery Products Directives. All commercially harvested shellfish are subject to strict hygiene regulations. Some people do suffer from allergies to shellfish, and this is an unfortunate fact of life. Often the allergies are very specific and caused by one type of shellfish only. Shellfish should be carefully stored keeping them cool but moist. Do not re-water shellfish, which you have bought. They will already have been cleaned to the requisite standard and re-watering only increases risk of re-contamination.
Under certain conditions, some species of marine algae form blooms with can produce natural toxins. Bivalve molluscs, like mussels and scallops, feeding on these microscopic algae may accumulate these toxins, which are a potential risk to human health. These "red tides" occur worldwide and are a natural phenomenon. Under the European Commission's Shellfish Hygiene Directive, Member States must have algal toxin monitoring programs, which cover all the commercial shellfish production areas. Target levels of toxins are set by the EC and fisheries can be closed to protect the public health if concentrations of toxins exceed these limits. In 2007 scallop beds along the west coast of Scotland were affected by a bloom which caused Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP).
Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning is caused by domic acid which is produced naturally by marine diatoms of the genus Pseudonitzschia. If molluscan shellfish filter large amounts of these algae it can lead to illness such as gastrointestinal symptoms, muscular aches, cramps and temporary loss of short-term memory.
To date, there have been no illnesses in the UK, which can be linked to ASP toxins and the strict monitoring safeguards have been effective.
All three algal toxins known to occur occasionally in British waters are routinely monitored and the fisheries closed when necessary.
Shellfish and Nutrition.
Shellfish should form an essential part of any healthy diet. Shellfish provide protein, vitamins and minerals, are low in fat and a wonderful source of the Omega-3 fatty acid. Different shellfish have different health benefits so, to make the most of these, we should vary the types we eat. There over 20 species available to eat in the UK alone.
Shellfish are excellent sources of protein; a 100 gram serving of shellfish provides about 10-25 grams of protein, roughly a third to half of the average UK recommended protein intake. The protein in shellfish is of high quality, containing many essential amino acids and, because of a lack of connective tissue, very digestible for people of all ages. Shellfish are also generally lower in fat, less than 5%, and accordingly contain fewer calories than beef, poultry or pork. For example, a 100g portion of prawns (a typical prawn cocktail amount) contains only 0.2g of saturated fat and 76 calories, whilst 100g of beef mince contains 6.9g and 225 calories.
Table below: all values = per 100g serving
Contrary to the "old wives tale" that certain shellfish (i.e. prawns) raise cholesterol we now understand that the amount of saturated fat in the diet has a greater effect in raising blood cholesterol than the amount of cholesterol in the diet. So while dietary cholesterol is present in prawns, crabs and lobsters, as well as in squid and octopus, they contain very little saturated fat and for most people do not cause a rise in the level of cholesterol in the blood. Shellfish such as cockles, mussels, oysters, scallops and clams are very low in cholesterol, about half as much as chicken, and contain much less cholesterol than red meats.
Different shellfish contain different amounts of omega 3 fatty acids. Overall shellfish contain similar amount to whitefish, but crab and oysters are particularly rich sources, a 100g portion of each providing a third of the UK recommended weekly intake of omega 3!
Shellfish are also loaded with vitamins. Half a dozen oysters provide approximately 10% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A while a cocktail amount of prawns provide around 50% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin E. There is little Vitamin C found in shellfish, but all shellfish are good sources of the B complex vitamins, particularly B12 with most species exceeding the recommended daily amount by at least 200%.
Seafood in general is an excellent source of minerals. Shellfish are especially valuable sources of copper, iodine and zinc. Other minerals in shellfish include iron (cockles, oysters and mussels), selenium (crab, octopus, squid, lobster, shrimps and mussels). Shellfish are also high in potassium, with most species providing 10% of the recommended daily amount per 100g serving.
Shellfish Industry Development Strategy (SIDS).
The SAGB's most recent focus is under the SIDS framework, which requires the company to formulate a strategy detailing ways to achieve the sustainable development of the shellfish industry, that fully recognises the need for environmental and social sustainability as well as commercial development. The relative timeframes for initiatives to be achieved ultimately is targeted within the Defra “2027 Fisheries Vision” (and other national strategies).
About the Shellfish Industry.
The shellfish industry in the UK is often perceived as the poor relation when compared to the fin-fisheries such as cod and haddock. The industry is generally viewed and depicted as a quaint, cottage industry that sells its wares on the quayside for enough of a profit for a few beers that night. But what of reality?
Wild Stock.
It may be surprising to learn that the UK shellfish industry is vast. Wild-caught shellfish landings have now overtaken cod and haddock, the traditional mainstays of the fleet. Of the 417,000 tonnes of seafood landed into the UK in 2006, shellfish contributed just over 133,000 tonnes or 32% of the volume. Demersal finfish (such as flatfish, cod, haddock etc.) and pelagic finfish (such as herring and mackerel) each contributed around 141,000 tonnes, approximately 34% of the total volume each.
Landings of shellfish increased by 7% from 2005 and look to continue rising as fin-fish landings continue to decrease. Over the same time pelagic landings decreased by 31% and demersal landings decreased by 6%. Indeed since 1999 the volume of fish landed into Scotland (Scottish Government Fisheries Statistics 2006) shows that demersal fish are down by approx 51%, pelagic fish down by approx 36% while shellfish are up by approx 19%. So it certainly appears that shellfish is THE dominant growth sector.
In terms of value, in 2006 shellfish landings were worth nearly £241 million, which is almost a 30% increase compared with 2005. Of total seafood landed into the UK by UK vessels in 2006, demersal species represented 37 per cent of total landings in terms of value while pelagic species accounted for only 15 per cent by value. Overall shellfish accounted for 48% per cent of all seafood landings by value.
Cultivated Stock.
The total value of the shellfish cultivated in the UK in 2006 was estimated to be £23 million, from just over 29,000 tonnes. Pacific oyster production in England increased by 56% compared with the amount farmed in 2005. About 64% of this production takes place in the South West of England, with a further 30% from farm sites in East Anglia.
Trade.
In 2006 UK vessels landed 133,000 tonnes of shellfish into the UK:
41,000 tonnes Nephrops (31%)
26,000 tonnes crab (20%)
19,000 tonnes scallops (14%)
11,000 tonnes cockles (10%)
10,000 tonnes mussels (9%)
26,000 tonnes all other species
In 2006 the UK exported 105,000 tonnes of various species of shellfish in similar proportions to percentage landed. We export approximately 79% of what we land, 25,000 tonnes go to Spain (24%), 20,000 tonnes to France (19%) which is where Brits typically eat shellfish on holiday.
In 2006 the UK imported 117,000 tonnes of shellfish, 47,000 tonnes of prepared prawns & shrimps (40%), 43,000 tonnes of fresh/frozen/chilled unprepared prawns & shrimps (37%) so in total 77% of all imports were cold or warm water prawns & shrimps.

Deepa Kumar

Deepa Kumar (;) is an Associate Professor of Media Studies and Middle Eastern Studies at the Rutgers University (New Jersey). She is the author of "Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire" and "Outside the Box: Corporate Media, Globalization, and the UPS Strike".
Writings.
Media Representations of Labor.
"Outside the Box: Corporate Media, Globalization, and the UPS Strike".
"Outside the Box" (ISBN 0-252-03172-5, University of Illinois Press) looks at the need for a critical analysis of how labor struggles are presented and packaged by the corporate media—and how this bias can be counteracted—by examining the most successful national strike in recent years by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters against the United Parcel Service. Ron Carey the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has praised the book calling it ""A brilliant analysis of the UPS strike, its treatment in the media, and how the Teamsters were able to win public support. It offers valuable lessons, and is a must read for everyone in the labor movement"" while the Journal of Communication has been quoted as saying ""Not only a significant contribution to the field but also a practical guide to how organized labor can intervene and enact social change in a still severely compromised public arena.""
Writings on Islamophobia, Political Islam, and Empire.
"Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire".
In August 2012 "Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire" (ISBN 9781608462117, Haymarket Press) Kumar makes the case that the Bush administration's “war on terror” ushered in an era of anti-Muslim racism, or Islamophobia, after the events of 9/11. She argues that that tragedy did not create the image of the "Muslim enemy," and instead examines the 900-year historic relationship between anti-Muslim racism and the agenda of empire building. Beginning in the eleventh century and the context of the Crusades, Deepa Kumar offers a sweeping historical analysis of the changing views of Islam and Muslims in the West, examining the ways that ruling elites throughout history have used the specter of a “Muslim enemy” to justify their imperial projects.
Danish cartoons.
Following the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy which depicted the Islamic Prophet Muhammed in a negative light, Kumar wrote an article against the publication of the cartoons titled 'Danish Cartoons: Racism Has No Place on the Left', where she argues that the left's criticism of Muslim outrage is actually a form of anti-Muslim racism. Her article was read by tens of thousands and posted on websites around the world. It also attracted criticism, and in response Kumar wrote another article in the Monthly Review, titled ""Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics"".
Green Scare.
Kumar coined the term “Green Scare” (where green refers to the color of Islam rather than environment activists) to talk about the process of fear mongering analogous to the “Red Scare” of the McCarthyite period. This was in response to the media portrayal of the "homegrown threat" of Muslim Americans after a 2009 small increase in the number of Muslim Americans expressing support for extremist Islamists or carrying out attacks while she note that "there has been a steady and dramatic decline since 2004, with only a slight increase in this overall trend in 2009.”
Political Islam.
Kumar takes a historical approach to her analysis of the parties of Political Islam. She states that Islamist parties have risen to prominence over the last three decades of the 20th century for various reasons: “the active role played by the U.S. in posing Islam and political Islam as an alternative to secular nationalism and the left; persistent imperial intervention and domination; internal weakness that led to the decline of secular nationalist and various left parties, creating an ideological vacuum that Islamists were able to occupy; economic crises and its exacerbation under the neoliberal era, which present an economic opening for Islamists and their charitable networks.” 
Kumar argues that Muslim majority societies don’t automatically produce religious political parties but that they are the outgrowth of particular historical factors.
She argues that progressives should view these parties, when they oppose imperialist, as potentially deserving support of the left. She gives the example of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which with the popular support from Lebanese people fought back against Israel’s invasion in 2006. But she says that this support should be limited and context-based stating that “we often find that Islamist groups are self-serving entities that are not principled anti-imperialists,” and are not absolved of criticisms on reactionary, anti-feminist, or anti-gay political positions they may hold.
Kumar has criticized the automatic designation of Islamist groups like Hamas as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) noting that it is a political party that has the support of Palestinians because it has taken up "the mantle of national resistance against Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands." While she critiques its "reactionary" politics and attitudes towards women as well as its policing of "immorality," she points out that it came to power through generally-recognized free and fair elections in 2006. She argues that it is for the people of Palestine to decide who should govern them, not Israel or the US.

Radicals for Capitalism

Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement is a 2007 book by American journalist and "Reason" senior editor Brian Doherty. It is about the history of libertarianism in the 20th century. It traces the evolution of the movement, as well as the life stories of Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises, F. A. Hayek, and Murray Rothbard, and details how they intertwined.
The book does not proceed strictly in chronological order, preferring instead to break up the action into short stories around central themes. Doherty said he was inspired to write the book because "libertarian ideas and the people who advocated them in the 20th century deserve attention and credit." It was reviewed in "The New York Times", the "City Journal", "The San Diego Union-Tribune" and "The Washington Times". "The Guardian" proclaimed it to be "the standard history of the libertarian movement for years to come".

Pushkin House

The Pushkin House (, "Pushkinsky Dom") is the familiar name of the Institute of Russian Literature in St. Petersburg. It is part of a network of institutions affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Establishment.
The Russian Literature Institute began its life in December 1905 as the main centre for Alexander Pushkin studies in Imperial Russia. A commission in charge of erecting a Pushkin monument in St. Petersburg, led by Sergei Oldenburg and Aleksey Shakhmatov, suggested a permanent institution be set up to preserve original Pushkin manuscripts:
The idea won support from all sides and was welcomed by Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich. It was understood that the Pushkin House would be housed in a purpose-built Neoclassical edifice, or Odeon, but the idea failed to materialize owing to lack of funds. 
In 1907 Vladimir Kokovtsov, Minister of Finance, came up with the proposal to acquire a huge collection of Pushkin manuscripts and memorabilia amassed in Paris by Alexander Onegin from 1879 onwards. The negotiations dragged on until Onegin's death in 1925, but the bulk of his collection eventually ended up in Russia. The most precious items had been presented to Onegin by Vasily Zhukovsky's son. The personal libraries and manuscripts of Ivan Krylov, Pyotr Pletnev, and Andrei Bolotov were acquired from their heirs soon afterward.
Soviet era.
The Pushkin House was originally a non-governmental organization specializing in Pushkin studies, which have been recognized by Russian authorities as a separate branch of scholarly inquiry. The Russian Revolution led to the shutdown of all non-governmental institutions, but the Pushkin House was spared and put under the umbrella of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in 1918). Such "honorary" directors as Anatoly Lunacharsky, Lev Kamenev and Maksim Gorky ensured its safe passage through the hardships of the Revolution.
This entailed the extension of its scope to encompass all Russian classical writers of the 19th century. In 1920 the Pushkin House was renamed the Institute of New Russian Literature to reflect its new purpose. Its main object was to prepare highly authoritative "academic" editions of works by Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Vissarion Belinsky, Ivan Turgenev, Nikolai Nekrasov, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and other luminaries of the previous century.
In 1927 Pushkin House moved from the crammed rooms in the Academy of Sciences building to the magnificent neo-Palladian Customs House, built after Giovanni Francesco Lucchini's designs in 1829-32 and situated just around the Strelka. It was to the original Kunstkamera rooms that Alexander Blok referred in his last poem "To Pushkin House", celebrating Pushkin's heritage as a gleam of hope during the chaos and confusion of the post-revolutionary years:
The Pushkin House remained open during the gruesome Siege of Leningrad, although most of the staff and manuscripts were evacuated to other cities. Following the war the institute continued as a prominent academic centre for Russian literature, employing such leading scholars as Boris Eikhenbaum and Dmitry Likhachov.
Nowadays.
The collections of the Pushkin House, partly housed in a modern block hidden behind the Neoclassical facade, include numerous manuscripts from the 13th century onward, portraits and personal documents of leading Russian authors, as well as a galaxy of rare music recordings. The institution has a complex structure and is subdivided into several departments: 
The Pushkin memorial houses in Mikhailovskoye, Trigorskoye, Tsarskoe Selo, and on the Moyka River are also affiliated with the Pushkin House.

History of Bowral

Bowral is a town in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia. It has a history spanning nearly 200 years.
Pre-colonial times.
The Bowral area during pre-colonial times was a part of land that belonged to the Tharawal Aboriginal Tribe. However, no permanent aboriginal settlement occurred because of the area's cool climate. The name Bowral is believed to be derived from the Aboriginal word "Bowrel" which loosely translates into the word "High".
European discovery and early settlement: 1780 - 1830s.
The area of Bowral was first traversed in 1789 by ex-convict John Wilson and his search party. Wilson's search party had been commissioned by Governor Hunter to explore south of the new colony of Sydney.
After Wilson's expedition a series of expeditions followed decades later by John Warby and Botanist George Caley (an associate of Joseph Banks), the Hume brothers and later famous pioneer explorers John Oxley and Charles Throsby.
In 1817, Charles Throsby was given land by Governor Lachlan Macquarie of the New South Wales colony. Throsby established a small township named Bong Bong which today is located 7 km north of Bowral. Throsby built Old South Road, a road that lead from Stonequarry (Picton) and Sydney to Goulburn and the southern plains of New South Wales.
Governor Macquarie had also given 2,400 acres (9.7 km2) to John Oxley in a land grant. This land would one day be present-day Bowral. John Oxley never lived in the area but he sent his sons to live in the area as sheep and cattle pastoralists. Oxley's sons named the area around Bowral "Wingecarribee"; the current name of the local government area of the Southern Highlands.
In 1831, 3,000 acres (12 km2) had been granted to what is known today as East Bowral to a Sydney business man, 
Edward Riley whose son, George took residence on the land.
Village: 1840 - 1850s.
During 1857- 1858, John Oxley's sons, John Norton Oxley and Henry Molesworth Oxley had built the locally renowned "Wingecarribbee" homestead that remains until this day. The homestead held the Wingecarribee (modern-day Bowral) village's Church of England services. The homestead is currently privately owned. 
It is during this period in time that Henry conveyed his share of the 4,200 acre grant to his older brother John. John subdivided 200 acres (0.81 km2) as it was known that the railway would be constructed through the district. The arrival of the railway in 1867 was the catalyst for the development of Bowral from a private village into a township. Henry also subdivided the land for farms which in the future lead to growth in Bowral.
Township and railway: 1860 - 1890s.
During the mid to late 19th Century (1860 - 1890s), Bowral rapidly grew as a town and by the end of the 1890s it had was a small town that had a bakery, blacksmith, newsagency, general store, hotels and post office. It was during this time that Bowral had a substantial growth of residency due mainly to the building of the railway line from Sydney to Melbourne.
Churches and schools.
In 1860, a church which doubled as a school on a glebe was built on land that covered . This land was set aside by John Oxley Jnr. It was located near the present day Bradman Museum. It had 100 enrollments upon its opening. The students were mostly children of railway workers.
In 1863, a permanent stone building was built for the church. However, the building would be replaced by the first Anglican church of St. Simon and St. Jude. The church and chapel had been designed by Edmund Blackett and was built on the glebe in 1874. The churches would once again be subject to rebuilding in 1887 because the churches had been deemed to small for the growing town. Today, only Blackett's belltower remains on the current St. Simon and St. Jude. 
During the 1880s, a school and hall had been built and extended on the church's ground. However, due to Henry Parkes' Public Education Act, the school went under state education. The school remains today as the local primary school across the road from the church.
The new Bowral Public School in 1898 had constructed on a few buildings including a 2 storey building to cater for secondary education. Bowral's school had been used as a combined primary and secondary educational institution until the construction of Bowral High School (in 1928) leaving the original buildings as a primary school.
In 1864, Wesleyans or Methodists had built a chapel on Bendooley St. However, in 1881, they demolished 
the original chapel and built a church. Nearly 40 years later, in 1926 with the formation of the Uniting Church of Australia, the church was demolished and rebuilt.
Notably, in 1883, a religious event occurred in Bowral when the Salvation Army famously preached, performed and paraded in Bong Bong St.
The first Catholic Church of Bowral was built in 1891 on Banyette St. This was the first movement of the Catholic Church into Bowral. Bowral had long been considered a "Protestant" town unlike its neighbouring towns Moss Vale and Mittagong which had a Catholic presence. This original church on Banyette St. was sold to the Evangelical Church in 1986 and rebuilt next to St. Thomas Aquinas School and presbytery on the same year.
Hotels.
The first hotel of Bowral was built in 1862 named the "Wingecarribee Inn". The building was built on the corner of modern day Boolwey and Bong Bong St (where the current Royal Hotel is). The second hotel was built in 1887 named "The Grand Hotel & Motel". The building had 35 rooms. The original Hotel building remains but only a quarter of the building is used as hotel. The building is now known as "The Grand Bar and Brasserie".
Town development and railway.
After and during the construction of the railway line from Mittagong to Moss Vale in the late 1860s and 1870s, petitions brought forth by recent settlers to open a station at Bowral. These petitions as well as the increased commerce, agriculture and industry in Bowral lead to Bowral Station opening in 1886. The present Bowral station is where the original station was built. The station was originally called "Burradoo", however the name was changed to "Bowrall" and then at the turn of the century its modern spelling "Bowral". ("For more information, see Bowral Railway Station")
In 1876, milk was shipped from Bowral Station and during the 1880s due to the railway shipping to Sydney and Goulburn, a tannery was also built. The tannery had operated where the current Commonwealth Bank stands today.
Before the construction of the Grand Hotel, the site was where the first School of Arts was built. The building was rebuilt to its current position in Bendooley St in 1884. The current Police station was built 3 years later next to the School of Arts on Wingecarribee St and 1896, the Bowral Court house was built next to the police station.
In 1886, Bowral established itself as its own municipality. The "Bowral Municipality" was 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) with a population of 1,000. The Victorian Imperial-style town hall 
of the municipality was built in 1890 next to the police station.
The town of Bowral had to rely on the Berrima District Hospital in Berrima for the towns health needs until 1863 with Jacob Ward becoming Bowral's first doctor.
Gardens and European plants flourished from 1887 when citizens started planting European and English deciduous trees to make the area look more British.This legacy still lives on throughout Bowral. Notably, the Oaks at the start of Bong Bong St are a characteristic which makes Bowral distinctive from other rural towns.
A signal of Bowral's significant growth into a town was established when in 1889 Bowral's lamps were lit by gas. The demand of gas paved way for Bowral's first private gas-works in 1890.
Country town 1900-1950s.
Bowral, once an independent municipality during the early 20th century, became part of Nattai Shire based in Mittagong in 1906. It was also during this time where the Bowral population boomed evident in the opening of schools such as Bowral High, Chevalier College and St. Thomas Aquinas.
In the 1920s-30s, Bowral developed a reticulated water supply, the construction of Bowral Hospital and the installation of electricity into Bowral from Port Kembla in 1925, as well as the installation of a town sewerage system in 1935.
It was in 1923 when Robert Loseby gave away some land behind Bowral Hospital for a local park and Bowral High School. The local park had become a major sportsground with 2 ovals and later a greyhound track. Currently, the park is divided into a skatepark, tennis court, youth centre and sporting field known as "Loseby Oval".
Bowral's quick development and population during this time was evident when in 1909, the glebe where the Anglican Churches stood was subdivided into residential land. This land includes the land where the current Bradman Museum is located. However, a large portion of the land was reserved as a large park known as "Glebe Park" which remains until this day across the road from Bowral Hospital.
Development of schools.
Bowral, once considered a "Protestant Town", has had a Catholic church since the 1890s. This church, St. Thomas Aquinas, led to an influx of Catholics into the area and in 1904, the nuns of Our Lady of Sacred Heart bought land known as "Belmore Park" on Centennial Road and established a convent school. In 1924, Belmore Park became a boys college still under the nuns of Our Lady of Sacred Heart. Belmore Park today serves as a park and function centre.
During World War II, a stronger Catholic presence was felt when St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School and a new presbytery was built. Just three years later, in 1946, Missionaries of the Sacred Heart bought a large property in Burradoo and established it as Chevalier College which eventually became the largest secondary school in the Southern Highlands and Wollondilly Regions. The college is established as a day and boarding school for boys. However, in the 1970s, Chevalier had ceased to become a boarding school and became co-education upon the closure of the girls convent school in Moss Vale.
In 1928-30, Bowral High School was built. It served as a tribute building to the ANZACs of the Great War. Its original building remains until this day. The school served as the prime high school for the area from Picton to Moss Vale until Moss Vale's Primary School was upgraded into a High School.
The Springett family.
The Springett Family had established themselves in Bowral when they opened a general store in 1926. Two decades later the Springett Family expanded this general store into a bakery and soft-drinks plant. These buildings were the first to distribute soft drinks and sliced bread in the Highlands. The soft drinks plant was the first plant to make the soft drink Passiona in Australia.
Industry.
In 1920, Bowral's Brickworks were built to supply the booming residential and commercial growth in the Southern Highlands region. Bowral Brickworks remain until this day.
Milk had been shipped from Bowral since the 1870s and this paved way in the 1930s for the construction of Bowral's Old Milk Factory. This milk factory dominated the dairy industry around Bowral. The Old Milk Factory remains until this day.
Garden and reserves.
Since the late 19th century, the residents of Bowral had been gardeners, planting many decorate European trees and plants. This legacy paved the way for the construction of "Corbett Gardens" in 1911. The gardens are named after Ada Corbett. The gardens were established as a public garden with a large band rotunda. The rotunda was dismantled in the 1950s and rebuilt in the 1990s by donation from the Springett family.
In 1958, Corbett Gardens put Bowral on the map with its planting thousands of tulips that would flower during September. This annual tradition became known as "Tulip Time".
In 1919, of Mount Gibraltar was decreed as a nature reserve.
Hospital and ambulance service.
During the 19th century, Bowral relied on Berrima District Hospital for its hospital needs. However, in the late 1920s and 1930s, Bowral established its own health-care system with the construction of Bowral Hospital in 1935, which was expanded in 1959. The hospital's construction paved the way for ambulance station in 1935 in Bong Bong St. The station was later sold and is currently used as a commercial space.

Sonatina in G major (Anh.5, no.2) is a piece of music attributed to Ludwig van Beethoven.
Since the work was published in Hamburg, Germany after Beethoven's death, its authenticity is doubted, as it uses styles never seen by Beethoven before. It is split into 2 sections. The first is titled "Moderato" and is in 4/4 time; the second section is titled "Romance" and is in 6/8 time. The two sections are actually called 'The Two Sonatinas' and referred to as the First & Second Movements.

<doc id="18474905" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18474905" title="Finspång witch trial">
Finspång witch trial

The Finspång witch trial was a witch trial which took place in Finspång Östergötland in Sweden in 1617. Between seven and nine women died as a result. It has a special place in its country's history as one of the very few larger witch trials in Sweden outside of the period of 1668–1676, which was otherwise the time of the real witch hunt in this country, and also because it seems that the condemned was executed by burning, which was not the common way of execution for witch craft in Sweden. It was the biggest witch trial in Sweden before 1668, and resulted in the biggest execution for sorcery in Sweden outside of the 1668–76 witch hunt.
Background.
The Finspång witch trial was long treated as a legend, but it now confirmed to have occurred. The witch trial does not seem to have occurred from public hysteria, but rather, it was ordered from above. Ostrogothia was during the 1610s ruled as an independent Duchy by the king's cousin John, Duke of Ostrogothia, and his consort, Princess Maria Elizabeth of Sweden. The royal couple, especially the Princess, is considered to have been directly responsible as the instigators of the witch trial, together with their private chaplain, Claudius Prytz. Prytz had, as soon as he was installed, inspired the couple to the witch ideology by accusing a woman of having enchanted the Duke and Duchess, and as a result, the woman was burned at the stake; the legend says, that when she stood at the stake, she had grabbed the clothes of the Vicar Prytz and tried to drag him into the flames, but the executioner had pulled him loose. The case seems to have affected the duke and Duchess to a stern belief in witches; until then, witch trials had been uncommon in Ostrogothia, as they had been in all Sweden, and the laws made it hard to give a death sentence on the charges of sorcery and witch craft, but the Duke, who was allowed to issue laws in the duchy, changed this and issued new laws about sorcery which made it much easier to punish alleged sorcery by death.
Trial.
The documents of the trial are not clear. In 1616, there is a mention that the executioner of Finspång was occupied with the task of "lowering witches in the water and torture them to a confession". The ordeal of water seems to have been frequently used as well as torture, which was not otherwise common in Sweden; torture devices were specially made to be used in this trial, which was conducted in a similar manner to witch trials in other countries where they were more common. A commission of priests was gathered to judge. 
In 1617, the trial was finished and resulted in the execution of at least seven named women: 
Elin i Näs and Kerstin i Näs, Ingrid i Rippestorp, Margareta i Eketorp, Kirstin i Tråbrunna, Ingrid from Gållbo i Regna and Ingrid Orres from Vånga. Elin had been the first to be arrested. Lusse from Mullsäter died in prison before the execution. Lussi i Svartorp had been exposed to the ordeal of water and confessed to have been in Blockula and had sex with Satan with the women who had pointed her out, but her execution was delayed until 1620. At the same time, there is a mention of "two evil and reputed sorceresses, which their noble Graces Duke John and his noble consort Her Highness Maria Elizabeth condemned upon the order of God, burned on a village called Skoby vad." 
The seven condemned of the Finspång witch trial were taken out to the woods, to a cliff above a great bonfire, and pushed to their death in the fire below. If this is true, the method of execution would have been quite unique in the Swedish witch trials, where the condemned were usually decapitated before they were burned; though there are cases where the method of execution is unclear, there is only one case, that of Malin Matsdotter in 1676, where the condemned witch is confirmed to have been burned alive. 
The witch trial of Finspång has been a legend in folklore. A part of the woods has been called the Blockula-hills. A tarn is called the Sorceress Tarn. A cave is reputed to have been the hiding place for accused women from the trial. Out in the wood, the legend says that one can hear female vices crying out: "I am innocent!", and the one who dared mocked them will fall dead before the sun set, as a farm hand once did.
Aftermath.
The witch hunt of Östergötland in the 1610s can be seen as the first Swedish witch hysteria, but it was clearly ordered from above and not the result of a public belief. Next time a witch hysteria broke out in Sweden, in the great witch hunt of 1668–76, the 1610s witch hunts were taken as a bad example of those critical to the witch trials, such as the prime minister, Per Brahe: "To take to strong messures against those affected, as they believe in too much which is not real, will only increase the sorcery, as it happened in the reign of Duke John." And later: "The Prime Minister was reminded of the Princess of Duke John. She begun to burn some, and in the end, they were not a single wife who was not accused." It is notable, that the witch hysteria of 1668–76 only reach the parts of the country which had no previous experience of witch trials, and never touched Götaland.

Velhartice

Velhartice () is a village in the Czech Republic dating to the 13th century, dominated by the Gothic castle Hrad Velhartice. The castle was built 1290-1310 by a nobleman who later became courtier and close friend of the Emperor Charles IV (1316-1378). During the Thirty Years' War, Emperor Ferdinand II gave the castle to one of his generals, Don Balthazar de Marradas who, in 1628, sold it to Don Martin de Hoeff Huerta who bought it for his beautiful adopted daughter Anne-Marie of Moldavia.
In 1790s, the Desfours family, who at the time also owned the castle, built a paper-making factory in Velhartice which, during the World War II, made sleeping bags for the German Army. A leather-tanning factory opened in 1882 and during the Second World War provided leather for military boots made in the neighbouring town. In 1945, several armoured units of George S. Patton's Third Army were stationed in Velhartice. The last owner of the Velhartice castle, Prince Windisch-Graetz, was expelled to Austria in 1946. Presently the castle is claimed by the Czech Republic.

Shankar was the third son of Puttalingappa and Gangamma. His father ran a handloom textile industry. Shankar had his primary and secondary education in Dalvoy School and higher secondary education in Banumaiah's High School. His family got into financial crisis due to losses at textile industry. He could not even appear for SSLC exams because of financial problems. He worked as a daily wager in the then Mysore Electricity Board.
Career.
Shankar started his career as a Foundry man in the Railway workshop at Mysore in 1955 on a monthly wage of Rs. 80. This iron grinding work had an impact on his body. Shankar, who practised wrestling, participated in the Dasara wrestling competition in 1956 and received title from the then Chief Minister B. D. Jatti. He dreamt of winning the “Sri Mysore” wrestling title. But the wrestling competition was suspended for three years from 1957, following the violence which broke out during the competition that year, and as such his dream of winning the “Sri Mysore” title remained unfulfilled. His acting talent came to light when he played the role of Kadu Kuruba in the diamond jubilee celebration of Banumaiah's Institutions and received a prize from Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. 
He formed a drama troupe under the banner Bharani Kalavidaru and enacted plays such as Gadayuddha, Yechchama Nayaka, Yelahanka Bhoopala and Raja Gopichand throughout the State. 
M. P. Shankar made his entry into films in 1962 as a villain in the film Ratnamanjari, directed by Hunsur Krishnamurthy and made a name for himself in the cine industry. He earned the distinction of acting in 108 films. Shankar acted as a villain in films such as Veera Sankalpa, Kadina Rahasya, Naari Munidare Maari, Gandhada Gudi, Rama Lakshmana and Bhootayyana Maga Ayyu and with his flawless dialogues, clear voice and acting talent, made an indelible mark in the minds of the audience. Some of the roles he had played are only typical of Shankar. 
Shankar started his own production unit in 1968 under the banner “Bharani Chitra”. He began creating awareness about environment and wildlife through his films, beginning with the film Kaadina Rahasya. He incurred huge losses from the Shivarajkumar starer Gandhadha Gudi-2, and later lived a problematic life.
Death.
He died on 17 July 2008 after a prolonged illness at his residence Manjunatha Nilaya in Vijayanagar in Mysore city. He is survived by his wife Manjula, son Tilak and daughter Shobha. The last rites were held with full state honours in Mysore on 18 July.

Stephen Lushington (judge)

Stephen Lushington (14 January 1782-19 January 1873) was a Doctor of Civil Law, a judge, a Member of Parliament and a radical for the abolition of slavery and capital punishment.

He joined the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1806. In the same year, he entered Parliament as Whig member for Great Yarmouth, and he spoke in the Commons in favour of the bill to abolish the slave trade in February 1807, and remained a lifelong advocate of the anti-slavery cause. He was re-elected in 1808, but a few months later, after the defeat of a motion he had proposed to castigate the behaviour of Sir Home Popham, he resigned his seat and devoted his energies to his legal practice.
He returned to Parliament as the MP for Ilchester in 1820, and subsequently also represented Tregony, Winchelsea and Tower Hamlets. He continued to support all measures attempting to suppress slavery or the slave trade, and also proposed or attempted to propose motions to recognise the independence of South America from Spain (1820) and to abolish capital punishment (1840). He supported Catholic Emancipation and spoke in favour of repealing the civil disabilities which applied to Jews; he was also a strong supporter of Parliamentary reform, and advocated triennial parliaments and the secret ballot. He retired from Parliament in 1841.
His legal career continued parallel to his political one. In 1820 he was one of the counsel retained by Queen Caroline, and spoke in her defence during her trial before the House of Lords. In 1828 he was appointed judge of the Consistory Court of London. In 1838 he was made a Privy Counsellor and became judge of the High Court of Admiralty, in which post he continued until 1867. He was also Dean of Arches from 1858 to 1867, when he retired from all his posts due to ill health.

The equivalent raga in Carnatic music is Shubhapantuvarali. The Carnatic raga Todi is the equivalent of Bhairavi and does not have any similarity to the Hindustani Todi.

in ascent re, ga and dha are intoned slightly low, and tivra ma is very sharp. In descent the intonaltion of all these notes is normal

The distinctive phrase is r/g-\r\S, where r may be subtly oscillated.
Pa is omitted in ascent, but present and often sustained. 
Kaufmann mentions that some musicians would call Todi with Pa Miyan Ki Todi, but others would see no difference between Todi and Miyan Ki Todi.
Sometimes the ascent is performed without Sa, starting from Ni.
Organization and relationships.
Miyan Ki Todi is similar to Gujari Todi and many movements are common, but in Gujari Todi Pa is omitted and there is more emphasis on Re and Dha. 
Like Miyan Ki Malhar Miyan Ki Todi is said to be composed by Tansen, but this seems unlikely as the Todi scale in Tansen's time was the scale of today's Bhairavi and the name Miyan Ki Todi appears first in the 19th century literature.
Samay (Time).
Todi should be performed in the late morning
Rasa.
Todi is nearly always shown as a gentle, beautiful woman, holding a veena and standing in a lovely green forest, surrounded by deers.
Kaufman cites the Sangita-Darpana "With a fair erect body like the white lotus, and delicate like the gleaming dew drop, Todi holds the vina and provides fun and frolic to the deer deep in the forest. Her body is anointed with saffron and camphor"

Giovanna Bonanno

Giovanna Bonanno (c. 1713 – 30 July 1789) was an alleged Italian witch and professional poisoner.
Little is known of Giovanna Bonanno's early life, though she is believed to have been the same woman as Anna Panto, mentioned in 1744 as the wife of one Vincenzo Bonanno. She was a beggar in Palermo, Sicily in the reign of Domenico Caracciolo, Viceroy of Sicily (term 1781–1786). During her trial, she confessed to being a poisoner, and that she sold poison to women who wanted to murder their husbands. The typical client was a woman with a lover; she bought the first dose to give her husband stomach pains, the second to get him to hospital, and the third to kill him. The doctor was, in these cases, unable to ascertain the cause of the deaths. In the Ziza quarter in Palermo, several suspicious cases had occurred. The wife of a baker, a nobleman who had wasted his family's fortune, and another baker's wife (who was thought to have had an affair with a gardener) had all become ill.
One day, a friend of Bonanno, Maria Pitarra, was delivering a poison when she realized that the victim was to be the son of a friend, and decided to warn the mother. The mother made an order for the poison herself, and when Bonanno arrived, she was arrested. The trial opened in October 1788. Bonanno was accused of sorcery. Some of the apothecaries who were selling her potions were called to testify. She was executed by hanging on 30 July 1789.

GRB 070125 is a gamma-ray burst that occurred on 2007 January 25. It is unique in that it did not occur in a galaxy, but in intergalactic space. This is unusual, since GRBs are caused by hypernovae of young massive stars, which usually means having to reside in a galaxy, as almost all stars are formed in galaxies, particularly high mass ones. 
It is theorized that the star formed in the tidal tail resulting from the interaction of two nearby galaxies, deep in intergalactic space. 
A month after it was detected, the Large Binocular Telescope observed a 26th magnitude optical afterglow from the gamma ray burst

Bavarian C V

The Class C V (pronounced "C 5") of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") was one of the first European express train locomotives with a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. 
In 1896 Maffei built a steam locomotive for the Bavarian state exhibition at their own expense. It had coupled wheels with a 1,640 mm diameter and was therefore regarded as a multi-purpose locomotive. After the exhibition the Bavarian State Railway purchased this locomotive and, after thorough testing, ordered more engines of this type, albeit in a stronger version and with a 1,870 mm coupled wheel diameter, i.e. as genuine express train locomotives. Between 1899 and 1901 Maffei supplied 42 examples.
The C V had a four-cylinder de Glehn compound engine. Its low-pressure cylinders were external, operating on the second coupled axle, and were located between the bogie and the first coupled axle. The high-pressure cylinders were internal and worked the first coupled axle. The engines still lacked a superheater. In terms of its power (160 tons at top speed), the C V could only be used for a few years in heavy express train services. As early as 1903 the locomotives were relegated to secondary duties, but even there they did not stay long.
17 machines had to be given to France after World War I. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the remaining 22 examples as the DRG Class 17.3 with numbers 17 301 to 17 322. They were retired by 1930.
The vehicles were equipped with Bavarian 2'2' T 21,5 tenders.

Carl Johan Cronstedt

Carl Johan Cronstedt was a Swedish architect, inventor, Earl, noble, civil servant, scientist and bibliophile.
Biography.
Cronstedt was the son of Jakob Cronstedt (Olderman) and Margareta Beata Grundel. He was born in 1709 in Stockholm, Sweden. He married Countess Eva Margareta Lagerberg in 1744.
Cronstedt became a pupil of Christopher Polhem in 1729 and in 1733 was his apprentice. He studied civil engineering under Carl Hårleman and in 1743 became his successor as superintendent. He had this post to 1767 and carried out work at the following,
Inventor.
In the mid-eighteenth century Cronstedt, working together with Fabian Wrede, increased the efficiency of the wood-burning stove roughly eightfold with a new technology and invention. Their 1767 redesign of the traditional wood-burning stove directed the smoke and heated gases through long flues that wound up and down inside the stove. The stove and its flues were built of special masonry bricks that captured, and then radiated, more heat from the burning process. The new technology changed the pattern designs of large interior building space for residences and other public buildings. It allowed more rooms to be heated with the same amount of firewood. It had significant social and economical consequences throughout Sweden and later throughout Europe and America up into the twentieth century. Cronstedt's invention had significant environmental significance as well because it saved forests from excess usage.
Cronstedt showed how in a ceramic designed wood burning stove that much more additional heat could be captured in a heavily tiled system of five long internal flues. The innovation of his masonry stove system captured the heat from only periodic burning of wood. It would then spread out that heat over a longer period for a fairly constant temperature. Because of this it only needed to be lit in the mornings and in the evenings. This type of residential (or interior space) heating system is sometimes referred to as a "kakelugn" in a Swedish stove. In England and America it is called a "tile stove" or masonry stove. It is a type of "contra-flow stove" which the Chinese have made into a Kang bed-stove.

Cronstedt wrote and had published several books. Among these were,

C. W. Bergstrom

C.W. Bergstrom (born February 24, 1957) is a semi-retired American professional wrestler who was active in North American regional promotions during the early 1990s including a memorable stint in the United States Wrestling Association as Principal Bergstrom. He was one of the last major stars in Don Owen's Pacific Northwest Wrestling during its final years and was the last to hold the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship.
Career.
Pacific Northwest Wrestling.
Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, C.W. Bergstrom made his debut in Jim Crockett Promotions losing to Mike Golden at the Kaiser Convention Center in Oakland, California on January 14, 1989. Within three months, he began wrestling for promoter Don Owen in Pacific Northwest Wrestling teaming with Len Denton to defeat Scott Peterson and Billy Two Eagles on March 12. He and Denton lost to The Southern Rockers (Steve Doll and Scott Peterson) the next month.
On April 21, he and Scotty the Body entered the championship tournament for the then vacant NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship but were eliminated by The Southern Rockers (Steve Doll & Scott Peterson) who also defeated Al Madril and Joey Jackson and Col. DeBeers and Nord the Barbarian to win the tournament. He also acted as a special guest referee in a televised match between Al Madril and Jeff Warner on January 27, 1990. Warner was disqualified when he attempted to use a foreign object that Madril had brought to the ring.
Bergstrom lost to Denton twice later that year, including a disqualification loss in Salem, Oregon on October 19, and lost to him in a tag team match with Bill Francis against Denton and Brian Adams in Portland on December 23, 1989. During the next year, he would lose to Denton on June 23 and, in a tag team match with Craig Valeri, lost to Denton and The Equalizer on December 29, 1990. Throughout 1991, he faced Denton and the Equalizer with several tag team partners including Larry Oliver and Bart Sawyer and also defeated Denton in Estacada, Oregon on May 22.
On June 22, Bergstrom fought "Pretty Boy" Doug Masters to a time-limit draw. During the match, Bergstrom suffered a serious knee injury attempting a leapfrog. When color commentator Jimmy Jack Funk attempted to help Bergstrom leave the ring, he was attacked by Masters as well causing Funk to enter the match on Bergstrom's behalf until medical personnel were able to take Bergstrom back to the dressing room. Bergstrom was Master's second opponent of the night, the first being Mike Winner. Later that year, he and Mike Winner lost to Len Denton & Don Harris and, in Vancouver, Washington on December 29, 1991.
The following year, Bergstrom captured the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship from Ron Harris on April 21, 1992. Bergstrom would remain champion until the promotion's close three months later.
United States Wrestling Association.
After PNW's close, Bergstrom arrived in the Memphis-based United States Wrestling Association where he had a brief but memorable run as Principal Bergstrom. In one of his earliest matches in the promotion, he lost to Jeff Gaylord via disqualification in a "strap on a pole" match at the Mid-South Coliseum on May 24, 1993. Losing to Jerry Lawler on May 31, he continued to feud with Jeff Gaylord beating him on June 14 and Danny Davis on June 21. Defeating Jeff Gaylord on July 5, he and Melvin Penrod, Jr. defeated USWA Tag Team Champions New Jack and Homeboy for the titles later that night.
They successfully defended the titles for several weeks, including a title defense against Well Dunn (Rex King and Steve Doll) on July 12, and defeated Jeff Jarrett and The Moondogs (Moondog Spike & Moondog Cujo) in a 6-man tag team match with USWA Southern Heavyweight Champion The Vampire Warrior on July 26. They eventually lost the tag team titles to The Moondogs at the Mid-South Coliseum on August 2. Splitting up immediately after losing the titles, Bergstrom defeated Melvin Penrod in a "Loser Leaves Town" match a week later. After another loss to Jeff Jarrett, Bergstrom left the promotion wrestling his last match against Colin Scotts on September 13, 1993. He was later involved in talks with the World Wrestling Federation to bring in his character to feud with The 1-2-3 Kid as The Principal, however nothing ever came of it. The WWF would later use Shane Douglas in a similar in-ring persona during his second stint with the company.
On June 22, 1994, he appeared at a wrestling show for Art Barr teaming with Billy Jack Haynes and Rey Misterio, Jr. in a 6-man tag team match against Psicosis, Ryuma Go and Col. DeBeers. This card was organized as a sort of reunion show featuring former PNW stars as well as Mexican luchadores of Asistencia Asesoría y Administración.
Semi-retirement and the independent circuit.
Bergstrom would remain inactive during much of the 1990s, but returned to action in local independent promotions in the old Pacific Northwest territory. In July 1999, he headlined a wrestling event for promoter John Skinner at the Medford Armory losing to Steve "The Gigolo" Rizzano. This was the first wrestling event held in Medford, Oregon in nearly a decade. Returning to Eugene four months later, he teamed with Lou Andrews and Big Daddy Thunder in a 6-man tag team match fighting to a double-disqualification against Len Denton, Bruiser Brian and Billy Two Eagles on November 13, 1999.
On October 23, 2005, Bergstrem defeated Governor Wilson Kaine to win the CPW Heavyweight Championship. He also defeated Critter at an event for Sandy Barr's IGA Wrestling in Prineville, Oregon on December 10. He spent the next two years with Championship Pro Wrestling and NWA Oregon winning the NWA Oregon Heavyweight title three times. He won the NWA Oregon Heavyweight Championship from Colossus at the Benton County Fairgrounds in Corvallis on January 6, 2007. On January 31, Bergstrom defeated Heavyweight Champion Dr. Kliever at the Chehalem Armory Center in Newberg. This was a fundraising event for the Newberg High School water polo teams and, according to the Chehalem Park and Recreation District's Jim McMaster, this was the first wrestling event to be held in the city in over twenty years.
That same year, he competed for BAW Championship Wrestling. Although losing to "Big Ugly" JD Bishop on April 20, he beat Drake Frost and Alexis Smirnoff, Jr. during the summer. While in New Revolution Wrestling, he and Ritchie Magnett feuded with the NRW Tag Team Champions the Pacific Coast Blondes (Cameron Starr & Hearthrob Hanson) facing them in a series of matches during the summer, including a Canadian Lumberjack match in June 2007. Bergstrom defeated Tod Ruhl who submitted to a cross arm breaker at the "Final Friday" supercard in Gresham, Oregon on July 27, 2007. When Ruhl's valet Megan Nicole Desire attempted to distract the referee, Bergstrom pulled her into the ring. Bergstrom was immediately attacked by the Pacific Coast Blondes and Tod Ruhl, but was saved by Pete Storm who helped Bergstrom clear the ring.
Doctor Pains Clinic Wrestling.
On April 6, 2009, CW Bergstrom experienced the highlight of his long career when was presented the honorary Heavyweight Championship Belt by none other than Dr Pain himself in a fitting ceremony.

Lanny Neal Kean, Jr. (March 19, 1960 – January 13, 2009) was an American professional wrestler. He competed under several ring names, including Moondog Cujo and Cousin Junior. He died of a heart attack on January 13, 2009.
Professional wrestling career.
In 1983, Kean made his professional wrestling debut in Kentucky, where he competed as "Luscious" Lanny Kean. Two years later, he was brought into the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Cousin Junior, a member of the Hillbilly family. The kayfabe (storyline) family used the gimmick of unintelligent rural Southerners and performed square dances in the ring. They feuded with some of the WWF's top wrestlers, including Jesse Ventura, Bob Orton, Jr., and Roddy Piper. Kean's character was based upon Jethro Bodine from The Beverly Hillbillies, who Jimmy Hart, a manager in the company, suggested he emulate.
Kean was later replaced by Gene Petit, who competed as Cousin Luke. The reason for Kean's departure from the WWF is unclear. Hillbilly Jim, the leader of the Hillbilly family, has stated that Kean "went crazy". According to George 'The Animal' Steele, Lanny Kean had stated he had made enough money for life during his short run as Cousin Junior and retired. The true reason behind his dismissal is often thought to be drug abuse. Kean later competed in the Continental Wrestling Association, an affiliate of the American Wrestling Association (AWA), under the name Hillbilly Junior. He formed a tag team with Stan Frazier, who had been a member of the WWF's Hillbilly family as Uncle Elmer but used the name Giant Hillbilly in the AWA. They won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on August 30, 1986 by defeating the MOD Squad.
He next joined the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), where he was a member of the Moondogs under the name Moondog Cujo. Later, he was renamed Big Daddy Cyrus and feuded with Jerry Lawler, who held the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship. He formed a tag team with Crusher Bones in 1995. In 1997, Dutch Mantel gave Kean the ring name "Bloody" Ox Brody, which was a tribute to Ox Baker and Bruiser Brody.
Kean took several years off of wrestling but decided to return to competition as Moondog Cujo. In one match on April 27, 2007 after his comeback, Moondog Cujo Managed by Sal Corrente defeated The Barbarian in a Hardcore match in Memphis Wrestling. He also resumed his feud with Lawler.
Personal life.
Kean lived in Jamestown, Kentucky with his fiancee Sandra Deel. He had a daughter named Krystal. On January 13, 2009, Kean died of a heart attack in Franklin, Indiana at age 48.

Independence Memorial Hall

Independence Memorial Hall (also "Independence Commemoration Hall") is a national monument in Sri Lanka built for commemoration of the independence of Sri Lanka from the British rule with the establishment of Dominion of Ceylon on February 4, 1948. It is located at the Independence Square (formally "Torrington Square") in the Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo. It also houses the Independence Memorial Museum. 
The monument was built at the location where the formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament by the HRH Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester occurred at a special podium February 4, 1948. 
Located at the head of the monument is the statue of the first prime minister of the country Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake "The Father of the Nation". Most of the annual National Independence Day celebrations have been held here. Apart from a monument it served as the ceremonial assembly hall for the Senate of Ceylon and the House of Representatives of Ceylon until the parliament was moved to the new parliament complex. Currently it is the venue for religious events and annual national day celebrations.
Design.
Built based on the "Magul Maduwa" (Celebration Hall), the Royal audience hall of the Kingdom of Kandy the last native kingdom of the island, where on March 5, 1815 the Kandyan Convention was signed between the British and the Kandyian Chieftains (Radalas) ending the Kingdom of Kandy.
In popular culture.
The Memorial Hall was featured as a pitstop on both 4th season of "The Amazing Race Asia", and 1st season of The Amazing Race Australia.

Bavarian S 2/5 (Vauclain)

The Class S 2/5 locomotives operated by the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen") included two express train, steam locomotives of American origin which were fitted with Vauclain compound engines.
In order to understand the design fundamentals of American locomotives, which were not well known in Germany at the time, the Bavarian State Railway imported, in 1899 and 1900, four locomotives manufactured by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in the USA. Following the two Class E I, "Consolidation", goods train locomotives delivered in 1899 with a 2-8-0 wheel arrangement, were two Atlantic 4-4-2 express train locomotives. These were typical American locomotives, with a boiler and running gear identical with those of the Class A-1 locomotives on the Milwaukee Road. Even the wheelbase on the two classes of locomotive was almost identical, albeit the driving wheels of the Bavarian locomotives, at 1,829 mm diameter, were smaller than those of the A2 (1,981 mm), so that they were about a ton lighter overall (at that time the usual axle loads in the USA were not significantly higher than in Europe). 
The locomotives had a four-cylinder, Vauclain compound engine, whereby the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders were located one directly above the other and worked on a common "Pleuel" connecting rod. The advantage of this design was that no internal gear was needed that would have been difficult to access and which would have needed expensive cranked axles.
Whilst this type of running gear did not catch on with the state railway or more generally within Europe, several advantages to the American sectional frame were identified, including better accessibility to an internally arranged running gear. As a result this type of frame was also made use of on the batch of ten S 2/5 locomotives built by Maffei in 1904 as well as all later Bavarian four-cylinder compound locomotives. However they differed from their American counterparts in that they were given inside cylinders and a cranked axle. 
The two Baldwin locomotives remained in service until after World War I under running numbers 2398 and 2399. In the Deutsche Reichsbahn's provisional renumbering plan at the beginning of the 1920s, the two locomotives were still included, as numbers 14 131 und 14 132, but a little while later they were retired. Of note in this connexion is that their American prototypes were still in service until the end of the 1930s, following their rebuild into a two-cylinder superheated configuration.

Giulia Tofana

Giulia Tofana (also spelled Toffana, Tophana) (died in Rome, July 1659) was an Italian professional poisoner. She was famous for selling poison to women who wanted to murder their husbands. She was the inventor of the famous poison Aqua Tofana, which is named after her.
Biography.
The information about her background is sparse. She was possibly the daughter of Thofania d'Adamo, who was executed in Palermo on 12 July 1633, accused of having murdered her husband Francis. Tofana was described as beautiful, and she spent a lot of time with apothecaries, was present when they made their potions, and eventually developed her own poison, Aqua Tofana. It is, however, also possible that it was her mother, Thofania d'Adamo, who made the poison and passed the recipe on to her daughter. She began to sell this poison to women who wanted to become widows. Her daughter, Girolama Spera, was also active in this. She eventually moved her business to Naples and Rome.
Giulia was sympathetic to the low status of women and most often sold her poison to women trapped in difficult marriages. She became known as a friend to the troubled wife and received many referrals.
Toffana's business was finally revealed to the Papal authorities by a customer; however she was so popular that the locals protected her from apprehension. She escaped to a church, where she was granted sanctuary. When a rapid rumour, claiming that she had poisoned the water, tore through Rome, the police forced their way into the church and dragged Toffana in for questioning.
Death.
Under torture, she confessed to killing 600 men with her poisons in Rome alone between 1633 and 1651, but this cannot be confirmed owing to the torture and the widespread distribution of the poison. She was ultimately executed in Rome (in the Campo de' Fiori), together with her daughter (Girolama Spera, known as "Astrologa della Lungara") and three helpers, in July 1659. After her death, her body was thrown over the wall of the church that had provided her with sanctuary. Some of the users and purveyors were also arrested and executed, while other accomplices were bricked into the dungeons of the Palazzo Pucci.
There are incorrect references to her purported execution in Naples in 1719. The legend that Mozart might have been poisoned using Aqua Tofana is completely unsubstantiated.
La Spara.
Tofana is in many sources confused with Hieronyma Spara, "La Spara", a woman with a similar profession in Italy about the same time. Probably this is another name of the 'astroliga della Lungara'.

Richard Blackie

Richard Blackie was a colourful but tragic Sydney character best known for his uncanny resemblance to Michael Jackson and for gathering one of Australia's largest collections of antique and vintage toys, comics and television & movie memorabilia for his lifelong ambition to create a toy museum.
Early life.
It is assumed that Richard was born in Queensland. Richard was taken away from his parents as a child due to abuse. His childhood was spent as a ward of the State, living in many foster homes. He attended Virginia orphanage and Virginia State Primary School on Brisbane's northside from 1971–1977, then went to Banyo State High school. Richard attended Sandgate District State High as well, finishing his schooling there. A quiet and reserved child, he spent time with his first girlfriend helping out her grandfather's homing pigeons until she felt he "started getting too protective and demanding".
Michael Jackson Impersonator.
Richard has stated to some sources that he has never had surgery. However, in a 1994 interview with "Woman's Day", Richard explained that he had paid $3000 and spent five hours undergoing surgery to match his face with that of Michael Jackson's and that he had also had eight operations to inject permanent dark skin pigment to line his eyes and eyebrows. Richard often worked as an impersonator at various venues, including shopping malls and on television. He said he had once appeared on a television talk show as Michael Jackson, when Jackson himself had cancelled at the last minute for security reasons. He appeared on the Ray Martin Midday Show in the 90's. 
Richard certainly had surgery, as he was quite dark in primary and high school, and later mirrored Michael Jacksons own change in skin tone. He was a lovely kid in primary school, though we could all see he wasn't well cared for.
Unfortunately, Richard's life in Brisbane was overshadowed by Michael Jackson's public antics and legal allegations and the public lashed out at Richard because of his resemblance. In 1994 after Michael Jackson had been accused of molesting a child, Richard's impersonation life took a turn for the worse because members of the public took out their anger with Michael Jackson on Richard. "Woman's Day" reports that Richard was called names such as "child molester" and "faggot" in the street and he had even been punched by a nightclub DJ who accused him of being a paedophile and smashed seven of his teeth, leaving Richard hospitalised for the night. It was in 1994 that Richard's anxiety set in permanently as venues stopped booking him, the threats increased and he was prescribed anti-depressants to the point where he overdosed on them. Richard stated that the Jackson scandal "wrecked my life. I walk down the street carrying the face of a wanted man. It's like being Jack the Ripper..." The fragility of his nose after the operation (doctors had told him that one punch could shatter his nose through his brain) was an added factor in inducing anxiety and causing Richard to become a recluse. It was this that ultimately led to him collecting his toys because staying inside left him feeling safe.
Richard's Dream - a Toy Museum.
The massive collection of toys and memorabilia that Richard collected over a 20 year period was impressive. "I've been called upon to round up all the old toys in the world," Richard declared in an interview with the SMH. His lifelong obsession was to open a toy museum. His friends have suggested that his obsession grew out of a childhood deprived of love and toys.
Documentary titled "Richard: "The Most Interestingest Person I’ve Ever Met".
In 2006, film student Maya Newell produced a 51 minute documentary titled "Richard : The Most Interestingest Person I’ve Ever Met" which premiered at Cannes Market Du Film in 2007. 
Seventeen year-old filmmaker, Maya Newell, enters the inner sanctum of Richard Blackie’s extraordinary, utterly bizarre toyshop. Striking up a curious relationship with the 41-year-old toy dealer, collector and ex-Michael Jackson impersonator, Maya is given permission to document the life of this most private of private characters, and the obsessions that drive him.
Death.
On 27 May 2006, Richard was found dead in his Petersham shop, his death attributed to suicide. Police were unable to trace any relatives, even though Richard often talked about his mother and a sister. He also spoke of a girlfriend who no one ever saw. Richard's body lay unclaimed in the City Morgue in Glebe for 3 months until a group of friends and a benefactor saved Richard the indignity of a pauper's burial in an unmarked grave. Richard was cremated on 8 September 2006 in a small ceremony attended by approximately 25 people at the Rookwood Gardens Crematorium.

<doc id="18475546" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18475546" title="Multivariate adaptive regression splines">
Multivariate adaptive regression splines

Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a form of regression analysis introduced by Jerome H. Friedman in 1991. It is a non-parametric regression technique
and can be seen as an extension of linear models that
automatically models non-linearities and interactions between variables.
The term "MARS" is trademarked and licensed to Salford Systems. In order to avoid trademark infringements, many open source implementations of MARS are called "Earth".
The basics.
This section introduces MARS using a few examples. We start with a set of data: a matrix of input variables "x", and a vector of the observed responses "y", with a response for each row in "x". For example, the data could be:
Here there is only one independent variable, so the "x" matrix is just a single column. Given these measurements, we would like to build a model which predicts the expected "y" for a given "x".
A linear model for the above data is 
The hat on the formula_2 indicates that formula_2 is estimated from the data. The figure on the right shows a plot of this function: 
a line giving the predicted formula_2 versus "x", with the original values of "y" shown as red dots.
The data at the extremes of "x" indicates that the relationship between "y" and "x" may be non-linear (look at the red dots relative to the regression line at low and high values of "x"). We thus turn to MARS to automatically build a model taking into account non-linearities. MARS software constructs a model from the given "x" and "y" as follows
The figure on the right shows a plot of this function: the predicted formula_2 versus "x", with the original values of y once again shown as red dots. The predicted response is now a better fit to the original "y" values.
MARS has automatically produced a kink
in the predicted "y" to take into account non-linearity.
The kink is produced by "hinge functions".
The hinge functions are the expressions starting with formula_7
(where formula_8 
is formula_9 if formula_10, else formula_11).
Hinge functions are described in more detail below.
In this simple example, we can easily see from the plot that
"y" has a non-linear relationship with "x"
(and might perhaps guess that y varies with the square of "x").
However, in general there will be multiple 
independent variables,
and the relationship between "y" and these variables will be unclear
and not easily visible by plotting.
We can use MARS to discover that non-linear relationship.
An example MARS expression with multiple variables is
This expression models air pollution (the ozone level)
as a function of the temperature and a few other variables.
Note that the last term in the formula (on the last line)
incorporates an interaction between formula_13
and formula_14.
The figure on the right plots the predicted 
formula_15 as formula_13 and 
formula_14 vary,
with the other variables fixed at their median values.
The figure shows that wind does not affect the ozone
level unless visibility is low.
We see that MARS can build quite flexible regression surfaces
by combining hinge functions.
To obtain the above expression, the MARS model building procedure
automatically selects which variables to use (some variables are
important, others not), the positions of the kinks in the hinge
functions, and how the hinge functions are combined.
The MARS model.
MARS builds models of the form
The model is a weighted sum of basis functions
formula_19.
Each formula_20 is a constant coefficient.
For example, each line in the formula for ozone above is one basis function
multiplied by its coefficient.
Each basis function
formula_19
takes one of the following three forms:
1) a constant 1. There is just one such term, the intercept.
In the ozone formula above, the intercept term is 5.2.
2) a "hinge" function.
A hinge function has the form 
formula_22
or 
formula_23.
MARS automatically selects variables
and values of those variables for knots of the hinge functions.
Examples of such basis functions can be seen
in the middle three lines of the ozone formula.
3) a product of two or more hinge functions.
These basis function can model interaction between two or more variables.
An example is the last line of the ozone formula.
Hinge functions.
Hinge functions are a key part of MARS models.
A hinge function takes the form
or 
where formula_26 is a constant, called the "knot".
The figure on the right shows a mirrored pair of hinge functions with a knot at 3.1.
A hinge function is zero for part of its range, so 
can be used to partition the data into disjoint regions,
each of which can be treated independently.
Thus for example 
a mirrored pair of hinge functions in the expression
creates the piecewise linear graph shown for the 
simple MARS model in the previous section.
One might assume that only piecewise
linear functions can be formed from hinge functions, but 
hinge functions can be multiplied together to form non-linear functions.
Hinge functions are also called hockey stick functions.
Instead of the formula_7 notation used in this article,
hinge functions are often represented by
formula_29
where formula_30 means take the positive part.
The model building process.
MARS builds a model in two phases:
the forward and the backward pass.
This two stage approach is the same as that used by 
recursive partitioning trees.
The forward pass.
MARS starts with a model which consists of just the intercept term
(which is the mean of the response values).
MARS then repeatedly adds basis function in pairs to the model.
At each step it finds the pair of basis functions that 
gives the maximum reduction in sum-of-squares
residual error
(it is a greedy algorithm).
The two basis functions in the pair
are identical except that a different
side of a mirrored hinge function is used for each function.
Each new basis function consists of 
a term already in the model 
multiplied by a new hinge function.
A hinge function is defined by a variable and a knot,
so to add a new basis function, MARS must search over
all combinations of the following:
1) existing terms (called "parent terms" in this context)
2) all variables (to select one for the new basis function)
3) all values of each variable (for the knot of the new hinge function).
This process of adding terms continues until
the change in residual error is too small to continue
or until the maximum number of terms is reached.
The maximum number of terms
is specified by the user before model building starts.
The search at each step is done in a brute force fashion,
but a key aspect of MARS is that
because of the nature of hinge functions
the search can be done relatively
quickly using a fast least-squares update technique.
Actually, the search is not quite brute force.
The search can be sped up with a heuristic 
that reduces the number
of parent terms to consider at each step
("Fast MARS"
The backward pass.
The forward pass usually builds an overfit model.
(An overfit model has a good fit to the data used to build
the model but will not generalize well to new data.)
To build a model with better generalization ability,
the backward pass prunes the model.
It removes terms one by one, 
deleting the least effective term at each step
until it finds the best submodel.
Model subsets are compared using the GCV criterion described below.
The backward pass has an advantage over the forward pass:
at any step it can choose any term to delete,
whereas the forward pass 
at each step can only see the next pair of terms.
The forward pass adds terms in pairs,
but the backward pass typically discards one side of the pair
and so terms are often not seen in pairs in the final model.
A paired hinge can be seen in 
the equation for formula_2 in the
first MARS example above;
there are no complete pairs retained in the ozone example.
Generalized cross validation (GCV).
The backward pass uses GCV to compare the performance of model subsets in order to choose the best subset: lower values of GCV are better. 
The GCV is a form of
regularization:
it trades off goodness-of-fit against model complexity.
The formula for the GCV is 
GCV = RSS / (N * (1 - EffectiveNumberOfParameters / N)^2)
where RSS is the residual sum-of-squares
measured on the training data and N is the
number of observations (the number of rows in the x matrix).
The EffectiveNumberOfParameters is defined in
the MARS context as
EffectiveNumberOfParameters = NumberOfMarsTerms + Penalty * (NumberOfMarsTerms - 1 ) / 2
where Penalty is about 2 or 3 (the
MARS software allows the user to preset Penalty).
Note that 
(NumberOfMarsTerms - 1 ) / 2
is the number of hinge-function knots, 
so the formula penalizes the addition of knots.
Thus the GCV formula adjusts (i.e. increases) the training RSS to take into
account the flexibility of the model.
We penalize flexibility because models that are too flexible will model the specific realization of noise in the data instead of just the systematic structure of the data.
Generalized Cross Validation is so named because
it uses a formula to approximate the error
that would be determined by leave-one-out validation.
It is just an approximation but works well in practice.
GCVs were introduced by Craven and
Wahba and extended by Friedman for MARS.
Constraints.
One constraint has already been mentioned: the user
can specify the maximum number of terms in the forward pass.
A further constraint can be placed on the forward pass
by specifying a maximum allowable degree of interaction.
Typically only one or two degrees of interaction are allowed,
but higher degrees can be used when the data warrants it.
The maximum degree of interaction in the first MARS example
above is one (i.e. no interactions or an "additive model"); 
in the ozone example it is two.
Other constraints on the forward pass are possible.
For example, the user can specify that interactions are allowed 
only for certain input variables.
Such constraints could make sense because of knowledge
of the process that generated the data.
Pros and cons.
No regression modeling technique is best for all situations.
The guidelines below are intended to give an idea of the pros and cons of MARS, 
but there will be exceptions to the guidelines.
It is useful to compare MARS to recursive partitioning and this is done below.
(Recursive partitioning is also commonly called "regression trees",
"decision trees", or CART;
see the recursive partitioning article for details).

Song of Ocarina

"Song of Ocarina" is a 1991 song recorded by the musicians Jean Philippe Audin and Diego Modena. It is entirely instrumental and is played on ocarina by Modena and cello by Audin. Released as the first single from the album "Ocarina", it achieved a huge success in France, topping the chart, and became the country's first instrumental number-one hit.
Song information.
This song was composed by Paul de Senneville who was best known for composing "Ballade pour Adeline" for Richard Clayderman and had already written several pop songs in the 1980s for the band Pop Concerto Orchestra.
In this instrumental duet, "the cello and the ocarina compete in expressiveness on a swinging rhythmic". The ocarina "gives to the song a thin and air tone which makes us travel in the Andean heights", while the cello "adds to the music a melancholic touch and the depth of the notes of archer".
In France, the single debuted at #37 on October 5, 1991, on the singles chart, and climbed until reaching the top ten five weeks later. It hit the chart for two not consecutive weeks and remained for 21 weeks in the top ten and 32 weeks in the top 50. It was certified Gold disc by the SNEP and remains to date the 883rd best-selling single of all time in France. In Switzerland, "Song of Ocarina" achieved a minor success: it stayed for three weeks on the chart (top 30), peaking at #14 on January 26, 1992.

Blacks Outdoor Retail

Blacks Outdoor Retail Ltd. is a British retailer, headquartered in Bury, Greater Manchester, England which owns the British outdoor retailers Blacks and Millets. Blacks is the largest outdoor retailer in the UK with stores nationwide. 
It entered administration in 2012 and was purchased by JD Sports. Since the acquisition by JD Sports, Blacks head offices have been relocated to JD's head offices in Bury.
History.
In 1931, Blacks published the first "Good Companions" catalogue. In the Second World War, Blacks made tents for the Army and Navy and made fenders for boats on D-Day. During the early part of the war, the workshops in Greenock were destroyed by a parachute mine on 8 May 1941.
A Canadian subsidiary opened in 1958. Throughout the 1960s, it bought smaller companies. Then in 1967, it bought Benjamin Edginton Ltd, a tent maker. In 1984, it joined with Greenfields plc, then became the Black Leisure Group plc in 1985. In 1994, Blacks Camping became Blacks Outdoors.
The Blacks Leisure Group was formed in 1985, which is now defunct as a company. It has doggedly survived financial difficulties in 1986 and 2009. In September 1986 the company and its 280 employees and 44 stores, almost went into receivership. A £3.3 million offer came from the Sears Group who owned Millets, but this transaction was not completed. It received a cash injection from investors to keep it afloat the following month. It bought Miss Sam Holdings, a childrenswear company, in July 1987 for £45 million. At this time it was headed by Bernard Garbacz. In 1989 it moved its operations to Washington.
It bought the Outdoor Group, which included Millets and Free Spirit, in November 1999 for £51 million, having first offered £55 million. At the time Blacks had 42 stores and a 40% share in the Fila UK Ltd sportswear firm; it sold this share to the parent company in July 2000 for £12 million. In May 2002 it sold its sports division, 187 First Sport outlets, to JD Sports for £53.2 million and bought 47 outlets of Famous Army Stores in February 2002. In July 2003 it bought the Just Add Water chain of 10 shops for £4.3 million. On November 2004 it bought 27 Outdoor outlets for £2.6 million from The Scout Association. Until 2006, it engaged in an expansion of its business by opening many new stores, especially on retail parks. This expansion was short-lived.
Financial troubles.
In 2008/9 it made a loss of £6.8 million, which was a pre-tax loss of £14.4 million. Freespirit and O'Neill were not selling well, but the more well known stores were better. In early 2009 it had 12 O'Neill surf shops but later that year Blacks is thought to have entered talks with Ronald De Waal (owner of the O'Neill brand name) to try to arrange a deal with between O'Neill and Logo Group International based in the Netherlands to offload the stores. Sadly, a deal never materialised and the stores faced closure when Sandcity, the company who held the licence to sell and distribute O'Neill in the UK was put into administration. Sandcity had been based in Washington, Tyne and Wear, which itself closed in May 2008, moving to the Northampton headquarters. The first UK based O'Neill store opened in December 1997 in Covent Garden Sandcity went into administration on 23 September 2009. This had to happen when the bank (Lloyds) refused Blacks' offer to convert them into Blacks and Millets stores. The wholesale licence of O'Neill in the UK was handed back to Logo Group International, based in the Netherlands at the same time.
In October 2009 89 stores where shut down as part of a restructuring, after the company went through a CVA which was supported by a huge majority of creditors. Before the closure it had 256 Millets, 116 Blacks and 32 Freespirit. By February 2010 it had 208 Millets, 92 Blacks and 13 Freespirit. The CVA was executed and Blacks exited a number of loss-making stores but not before a number of the stores classed as "loss making" underwent an extensive refurbishment program using around £6m of capital. The mostly costly of these stores was the Air Land and Sea store operating out of Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. After a costing an estimated £3m and branded "the first of many to open in the UK", the store was in operation for less than 12 months and closed as part of a CVA. Of all the stores refurbished, they were originally reported to be trading ahead of the rest of the estate. Several of the newly refurbished stores remained loss-making and were closed when a CVA was agreed. Of the refurbished stores, the newly refurbished blacks store at the ex freespirit site in Northampton was also closed.
On 23 November 2009, it reached an agreement with its creditors — landlords of its stores — which needed 75% backing. This saved the company from liquidation, with a period of great uncertainty from September to November. In the summer of 2009, camping was a popular option for many families who could no longer afford a more expensive holiday abroad though Blacks failed to capitalise on the estimated £1.2billion share of the UK market.
In early 2010, the company received a £26 million takeover offer from Sports Direct, which it fought off. Sports Direct owned around 30% of Blacks' shares. It was at this time that Blacks sold off its Mambo boardwear arm for an estimated £800,000 to New Zealand born Andrew Gerrie (CEO of Lush cosmetics).
Private equity funds, including the owner of rival Cotswold Outdoor, circled Blacks after it confirmed early talks on a possible offer in late October 2010
On 7 December 2011, the group was put up for sale. On 23 December 2011 the directors stated that the company was likely to enter receivership. The company was effectively insolvent and the shares likely to be worthless. Potential buyers would only be interested after an administration process.
As a business formality Blacks entered a 'pre-pack' administration for only four hours to allow the new owner JD Sports to take the business forward debt free.
Operations.
Blacks.
Blacks has 90 UK stores, originally specialising in the serious walking and hiking kit. Recently they have diversified to including running clothing and more fashion based lines.
In the 1850s, Thomas Black went to Australia, prospecting for gold. He then went to Spanish Guinea in West Africa, where he worked for the London company Laughland and Brown as an agent, where he traded calico cotton fabric for ivory. The conditions were not good for his health so he returned to Scotland, setting up a sailmaking business in Greenock in 1861. Many ships were made on the Clyde, but by the 1900s, fewer ships were powered by sail so his son Thomas (Junior) changed the business priorities to making tents instead. His father died in 1905 and he took over the company, making many tents for the Army in the First World War. He died in May 1930, and his son, D Crawford Black took over.
Millets.
Millets, with 77 stores. Own-brands that are sold within the Millets fascia are traditionally "Eurohike" + "Peter Storm" 
Millets was founded in 1893 by Mr J.M. Millet and had two stores in Southampton and Bristol. In 1978, the company moved to Northampton. In 1986, it formed Millets Leisure plc. This became the Outdoor Group in 1996 with 158 stores, which was bought by Blacks Leisure plc in 1999.
Sponsorship.
On 30 April 2013, Blacks Outdoor were announced as the new shirt sponsor for professional football team Oldham Athletic for the 2013/14 season On 25 June 2013, Blacks Outdoor were announced as the new shirt sponsor for Morecambe Football Club for the 2013/14 season 
Products.
The company manufactures the following brands for sale in its Blacks and Millets stores:
Although Millets stores predominantly sell own brand, both fascias do stock main brand products, including:
Former operations.
The Outdoor Group launched "Technicals" in 2005, initially as a fashionable and practical outdoor clothing range. It subsequently introduced a waterproof and breathable range of clothing branded "eVent", mainly featuring jackets and overtrousers. The "eVent" brand was gradually phased out, and the "Technicals" brand continued in Blacks stores until 2012, becoming a range of budget own-brand lines before eventually being withdrawn around the time JD Sports bought the company. Peter Storm branded products now fill the void left by the range.
The majority of Just Add Water stores were transformed into Freespirit stores after the company's acquisition. Just Add Water sold Surfing equipment such as surfboards and wetsuits.

Frank Mount Pleasant

Franklin P. Mount Pleasant (1884 – April 12, 1937) was an American football player, track and field athlete, and college athletics coach. He played college football at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School and at Dickinson College and competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics. Mount Pleasant served as the head football coach at Franklin & Marshall College (1910), Indiana Normal School, now Indiana University of Pennsylvania, (1911–1913), West Virginia Wesleyan College (1914), and the University at Buffalo (1915).
Early life and athletic career.
Separated from his parents, Chief John (aka Frank Senior) and Rachael, Mount Pleasant was sent to attend Indian Boarding Schools at a young age. He eventually attended the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1905 to 1909, where he competed as both a long jumper on the track team and as a quarterback and halfback on the football team. The 1907 Carlisle Indian team, coached by Glenn Scobey Warner, went 10–1 with a 26–6 victory over perennial powerhouse, Harvard. The team's only loss of the season came against Princeton in a game in which Mount Pleasant did not play. Mount Pleasant's teammates included future Pro Football Hall of Famer, Jim Thorpe, and future College Football Hall of Fame inductee, Albert Exendine. Despite being a second-team All-American, Mount Pleasant never played professional football. It is said that Mount Pleasant invented the spiral pass.
During college, Mount Pleasant tried out for the Olympics and became the first Carlisle student to qualify making both the 1904 and 1908 U.S. Olympic track teams. At the 1908 Olympics in London, Mount Pleasant finished sixth in both the triple jump and the long jump competitions. This ended his track and field career, leaving him with career bests of for the long jump and for the triple jump.
Coaching career.
Upon his return home, Mount Pleasant became the first Native American to graduate from Dickinson College. For three years thereafter, he coached football at the Indiana Normal School. His last two teams won state championships. 
Mt. Pleasant was the head coach for the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats football team located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He held that position for the 1910 season. His coaching record at Franklin & Marshall was 4 wins, 3 losses and 2 ties. As of the conclusion of the 2010 season, this ranks him #25 at Franklin & Marshall in total wins and #16 at the school in winning percentage (). In 1915, he coached the University of Buffalo football team to a 3 wins, 4 loss season. Mount Pleasant's coaching career was cut short by World War I, where he served his country as a first lieutenant.
Later life, death, and honors.
After the war, Mount Pleasant settled in Buffalo, New York, near his ancestral home and worked odd jobs throughout the remainder of his life. He enjoyed playing the piano. His death is a mystery. In 1937, policemen found him unconscious on a Buffalo sidewalk. He died three days later at Emergency Hospital. Initial reports indicated that Mount Pleasant sustained a fractured skull, "possibly by violence." But Francis M. Kujawa, the Buffalo medical examiner, ultimately ruled the death the effects of an accidental fall.
Several Hall of Fames have inducted Mount Pleasant, including the Indiana Normal School, Dickinson College, and the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame (1973). Chapman University in Southern California named a library after Mount Pleasant.

Michael Ferreira (born October 1, 1938 in Bombay [now Mumbai]), nicknamed "the Bombay Tiger", is notable amateur player of English billiards from India, and a three-time Amateur World Champion. He participated in the Indian National Billiards Championship in 1960 for the first time, and in 1964 represented India in the World Amateur Billiards Championship (WABC) held in New Zealand, where he progressed to the semi-finals. In 1977, he won his first World Amateur Billiards Champion title and followed it up with the World Open Billiards Champion title in the same year. He has two more WABC titles under his belt. In 1978 he became the first amateur to break the barrier of 1,000 points, in the billiards national championships, and created a new amateur world record by scoring 1,149 points.
Early life.
Ferreira studied in St. Joseph's School, Darjeeling, where he became interested in playing billiards. He was able to sustain his interest in the game during his college days in St. Xavier's College and the Government Law College in Mumbai.
Current life.
Currently Ferreira is associated with Qnet, a multi-level marketing company. In January 2014, the Mumbai Police issued a lookout Circular against Ferreira, for his alleged shareholding in the Indian franchise of QNet Ltd. The Indian franchise Vihaan Direct Selling (India) Private Limited is believed to have duped its investors using the banned binary pyramid business model. 
Awards.
Ferreira was awarded the Padma Shri award in 1981, after he had won his second world amateur title. But he refused to accept this and contended that as cricketer Sunil Gavaskar was offered the more prestigious Padma Bhushan award, he too should be awarded the same. He is the first billiards player to be awarded with the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award in India, which was conferred on him after he won his third world amateur billiards title in 1983. He is also the recipient of the Maharashtra state government's Shiv Chhatrapati Award (1971), the Arjuna Award (1973) and the International Fair Play Committee's Letter of Congratulations (1983). He received the Dronacharya Award in 2001 for his coaching achievements in billiards and snooker.

International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition

International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, August 23 of each year, the day designated by UNESCO to memorialize the transatlantic slave trade. That date was chosen by the adoption of resolution 29 C/40 by the Organization's General Conference at its 29th session. Circular CL/3494 of July 29, 1998 from the Director-General invited Ministers of Culture to promote the day. The date is significant because, during the night of August 22 to August 23, 1791 on the island of Saint Domingue (now known as Haiti), an uprising began which set forth events which were a major factor in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. 
UNESCO Member States organize events every year on that date, inviting participation from young people, educators, artists and intellectuals. As part of the goals of the intercultural UNESCO project, "The Slave Route", it is an opportunity for collective recognition and focus on the "historic causes, the methods and the consequences" of slavery. Additionally, it sets the stage for analysis and dialogue of the interactions which gave rise to the transatlantic trade in human beings between Africa, Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean.
The International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition was first celebrated in a number of countries, in particular in Haiti (23 August 1998) and Senegal (23 August 1999). A number of cultural events and debates were organized. In 2001 the Mulhouse Textile Museum in France conducted a fabric workshop entitled "Indiennes de Traite" (a type of calico) used as currency in trade for Africans. The International Slavery Museum opened its doors on August 23, 2007 in Liverpool where Slavery Remembrance Day events have been conducted since 2004.

Gellért Hill Calvary

Gellért Hill Calvary () was a Late Baroque calvary on Gellért Hill, Budapest which was demolished around 1950.
History.
The first calvary on Gellért Hill was built in 1715 by a citizen of Buda on the initiative of the Jesuit Order. The simple structure was made up of two stone sculptures and a wood crucifix. In 1795 Füll (or Fühl) Mihály started a public fundraising to build a new group instead of the old one which was already decaying. The magistrate of Buda supported the effort but it took decades to realize. In 1822 the calvary was described as ""recentius a Cive Michaele Fühl exstructa"" (recently built by Fühl Mihály). The road to the new group was lined by stations whose paintings depicted the sufferings of Christ. On Easter Mondays a procession climbed the steep road leading to the calvary to celebrate the resurrection. Tents and vendors were erected on a nearby meadow. The "emmausjárás" (Emmaus-walk) or "tojásbúcsú" (egg feast) was one of the most popular Catholic holidays of the year during the 18-19th centuries. In 1873 the citizens of the Tabán district repaired a few stations and decorated them with new paintings, painted on wood by „C. Sauer”. Many stations were demolished in the 1920s. Only three of them were still standing in the 1930s. The last photo about the building was made in 1943. The calvary was demolished around 1950.
Description.
The calvary stood in a very small, rectangular courtyard surrounded by brick walls. The front side was closed with a wooden gate between two brick pillars. The pillars were crowned with iron crosses standing on stone balls. The back wall was arched. The stone crucifix of the calvary was 3.5 m high and it was surrounded by three painted stone sculptures: Mary Magdalene kneeling, the Virgin Mary and John the Apostle standing. There was wooden niche behind the calvary symbolizing the Holy Sepulchre with two wooden angels.

Linagliptin

Linagliptin (BI-1356, trade names Tradjenta and Trajenta) is a DPP-4 inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for treatment of type II diabetes.
Linagliptin (once-daily) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 2 May 2011 for treatment of type II diabetes. It is being marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly.
Mechanism of action.
Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Both GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Thus, linagliptin stimulates the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreases the levels of glucagon in the circulation.
Clinical trials.
Results in 2010 from a Phase III clinical trial of linagliptin showed that the drug can effectively reduce blood sugar.
Chemical Synthesis.
Starting from commercially available 8-bromo-3-methylxanthine 1 linagliptin was prepared in four steps. As part of a sequential alkylation sequence, xanthine derivative 1 was first "N"-alkylated with butyn-2-yl bromide in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine followed by a second "N"-alkylation with (chloromethyl)-4-methylquinazoline 3 in the presence of potassium carbonate to furnish xanthine derivative 4. Subsequent nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the bromide in 4 with ("R")-3-Boc-aminopiperidine followed by the Boc deprotection of the primary amine in 6 yielded linagliptin.

Mao Wenlong

Mao Wenlong (; style name Zhennan 振南); (1579–1629) was a marine corps commander of the Ming Dynasty, famous for battling the Manchus in the Yellow Sea. He was known for excelling in artillery warfare and for successfully incorporating Western-style tactics into a Far Eastern military.
Early life.
Mao was born in Hangzhou and worked as a fortuneteller in his youth. He joined the Ming military in northern Shanhaiguan around 1600.
Career.
Mao is sometimes blamed for the Manchu invasion of Korea. He was known for operating against the Manchu from bases within Korea, a Ming ally at that time. When the Manchus mounted a punitive expedition into Korea, Mao ordered a general retreat of all Chinese forces. This angered many Beijing merchants who had previously traded with the Korean peninsula.
Mao never dared to drag major Manchu cities into war even when there was a strategic advantage in doing so. In addition, Mao bribed a number of eunuchs and other public officials. In this way Mao was able to bring to bear the influence of many powerful Chinese officials against Yuan Chonghuan, a fellow Ming military commander.
Mao engaged in widespread smuggling using the Ming marine corps, contributing heavily to the booming economy of northern China. He was eventually caught and executed by Yuan Chonghuan, a fellow military commander who had been conferred the imperial sword of absolute authority by the last Ming emperor for smuggling. It is believed that Mao's death lead in part to an economic downturn in Ming China.

John Joe Doyle

John Joe "Goggles" Doyle (1906–2000) was an Irish hurler who played as a left corner-back for the Clare senior team.
Doyle made his first appearance for the team during the 1926 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1938 championship. During that time he won one Munster medal. Doyle was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion.
At club level Doyle is a six-time county club championship medalist with Newmarket-on-Fergus.
In retirement from playing Doyle came to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time. In 1984 he was chosen on a special hurling team of the century made up of players never to have won an All-Ireland medal. In 1990 Doyle was presented with the GAA All-Time All-Star Award.
Playing career.
Club.
‘Goggles’ Doyle played his club hurling with his local club in Newmarket and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1925, the first of a famous three-in-a-row for Newmarket. Doyle captured another set of back-to-back county medals in 1930 and 1931. He won his sixth and final county championship title in 1936.
Inter-county.
Doyle first came to prominence for the Clare senior inter-county team in 1926 when he made championship debut. Clare’s campaign finished early that season; however, in 1927 Doyle’s side reached the Munster final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to win the game by 5-3 to 3-4.
1928 saw Clare take on Cork for the second consecutive year in the Munster final. That year Doyle’s side nearly pulled off a shock result, however, both sides finished level after recording 2-2. The replay was not a happy game for Clare as Cork trounced them by 6-4 to 2-2.
Two years later in 1930 Doyle was back in the provincial decider. Tipperary were the opponents on that occasion, however, Clare failed to make the breakthrough once again. A score line of 6-4 to 2-8 gave victory to Tipp.
In 1932 Doyle was appointed captain of the Clare senior hurling team. For the fourth time in six years Clare reached the Munster final. Once again, Cork, a team that had defeated Doyle’s side on many occasions, provided the opposition. The game itself saw Clare triumph for the first time since 1914. A score line of 5-2 to 4-1 gave Doyle his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final was an exciting affair with Clare emerging victorious over Galway by 9-4 to 4-14. This victory allowed Clare to advance to the All-Ireland final where Kilkenny provided the opposition. In a low-scoring but tense game Clare’s Tull Considine scored two goals and was foiled for what would almost certainly have been a third. These goals were negated by Kilkenny’s three goal-scoring heroes Matty Power, Martin White and Lory Meagher. The final score of 3-3 to 2-3 gave victory to Kilkenny.
Clare went into decline following this game as Limerick emerged as the dominant force in Munster. In 1938 Doyle was back and played in his final provincial final. Waterford provided the opposition on that occasion and, once again, Clare almost escaped with the victory. Waterford, however, went on to win the game by 3-5 to 2-5. Doyle retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat.
Provincial.
Doyle also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1929 as Munster defeated Leinster to win the Railway Cup. It was the first of three successive Railway Cup medals for Doyle. He won a fourth and final medal in 1934.
Post-playing career.
In retirement from playing ‘Goggles’ Doyle maintained a keen interest in the game as he came to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time. Long after his playing days were over the Gaelic Athletic Association celebrated its centenary year in 1984. Throughout the year a series of special events were held while special team selections were also named. While a special GAA Hurling Team of the Century was named, a special team of players who never won an All-Ireland medal was also selected. Doyle’s brilliance as a player was recognised when he was picked in the left corner-back position on that team. Six years later in 1990 Doyle’s reputation was further cemented when he was the recipient of the prestigious GAA All-Time All-Star award. Past winners of the award included Mick Mackey, Jack Lynch and Jim Langton.
1995 was a special year for 89-year-old Doyle and for Clare hurling. That year’s Munster final saw Clare captain Anthony Daly bridge a sixty-three-year gap since Doyle captained Clare to the provincial crown. Doyle was also present in Croke Park as Clare later defeated Offaly to win their first All-Ireland title since 1914.

BAE Systems Mantis

The BAE Systems Mantis Unmanned Autonomous System Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator is a British demonstrator programme for Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) technology. The Mantis is a twin-engine, turboprop-powered UCAV with a wingspan of approximately 22 m, broadly comparable to the MQ-9 Reaper. Other partners involved in Phase 1 of the Mantis programme include the UK Ministry of Defence, Rolls-Royce, QinetiQ, GE Aviation, L-3 Wescam, Meggitt and Lola.
Design and development.
Development of the Mantis started in late 2007, a mock-up being revealed at the 2008 Farnborough International Air Show. The Phase 1 Mantis vehicle is powered by two Rolls-Royce Model 250 turboprop engines, although this is likely to change in later variants. The Mantis is intended to have at least 24-hour endurance and is an autonomous vehicle, able to pilot itself and to plot its own course, communicating with personnel on the ground regarding its observations.
Phase 1 is intended to demonstrate BAE Systems' rapid prototyping capabilities and will focus on the evaluation of autonomous control systems. Later phases may evaluate civilian applications, armed variants and sensor packages. 
The large dome on the front, reminiscent of a pilot's canopy, actually contains an upward facing satellite communications system.
The prototype first flew on 21 October 2009 at Woomera Test Range in South Australia.
In 2013 the Mantis will be flight tested in the United Kingdom. It is being used as the basis for the new BAE/Dassault Telemos UAV.

Maryland Route 132

Maryland Route 132 (MD 132) is a collection of state highways in the U.S. state of Maryland. These four highways are sections of old alignment of and connecting roads with MD 22 in Aberdeen. MD 132 connects Aberdeen neighborhoods east and west of U.S. Route 40 (US 40) with MD 22 and Interstate 95 (I-95). MD 132B serves the area east of US 40 and north of MD 22 between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace. MD 132A and MD 132C are connectors between MD 132 and MD 22. The highways that are now part of MD 132 were originally built in the early 1910s and marked as part of MD 22 and US 40 in 1927. MD 22 was extended east and north along the US 40 portion when the U.S. highway was relocated in the 1930s. MD 132 was assigned to the highway when MD 22 was relocated in the late 1960s. MD 132 became a split route following the construction of a railroad grade separation in the 1980s.
Route description.
MD 132 runs between the west and east sides of Aberdeen. MD 132B runs from MD 22 in Aberdeen east to US 40 near Havre de Grace.
Aberdeen.
MD 132 begins at a cul-de-sac adjacent to I-95's interchange with MD 22 just west of the city limits of Aberdeen. The highway immediately receives a ramp from northbound I-95. MD 132 heads east as two-lane Bel Air Avenue through a commercial area and intersects Northeast Road; the north leg of the intersection is a one-lane ramp from eastbound MD 22 that is unsigned MD 132C. MD 132's next intersection is with Bush Chapel Road and Beards Hill Road. Beards Hill Road, which is unsigned MD 132A, provides access to MD 22 (Aberdeen Thruway) and that highway's interchange with I-95 a short distance to the west. MD 132 continues east through residential neighborhoods of Aberdeen, where the highway meets the southern end of MD 462 (Paradise Road) and passes the historic James B. Baker House.
MD 132 crosses CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision at grade and enters downtown Aberdeen, where the highway intersects US 40 (Philadelphia Boulevard). Adjacent to the intersection is the Aberdeen Amtrak station, which is also a stop on MARC's Penn Line. Immediately east of US 40, MD 132 makes a right angle turn south and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor on an S-curve. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus just south of the end of the bridge at its intersection with Norman Avenue and federal government-maintained APG Road in a residential neighborhood. Both streets connect with Post Road, which heads north as a municipal street toward MD 132B.
Aberdeen–Havre de Grace.
MD 132B begins at an intersection with MD 22 (Aberdeen Thruway) on the east side of Aberdeen. The state highway heads northeast as Post Road, a two-lane highway that passes between residential subdivisions and distribution centers. MD 132 leaves the city of Aberdeen and crosses Swan Creek before curving northwest and meeting Oakington Road on a tangent. Oakington Road leads to the Oakington community, which contained the farm of former U.S. Senator Millard E. Tydings. MD 132B's name changes to Oakington Road for the highway's final stretch, a crossing of the Amtrak Northeast Corridor immediately to the south of the highway's terminus at US 40 (Pulaski Highway).
History.
MD 132 and MD 132B are the old alignment of MD 22 in the Aberdeen area. MD 132 west of Paradise Road and MD 132B north of its southern terminus were constructed as macadam roads around 1911. Bel Air Avenue east of Paradise Road and Post Road south to Bel Air Avenue east of downtown Aberdeen were constructed as a concrete road in 1917. When the Maryland State Roads Commission first assigned route numbers in 1927, Bel Air Avenue was designated MD 22 and Post Road became part of US 40. US 40 was moved to its present alignment between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace between 1930 and 1933; Post Road was renumbered as an extension of MD 22 by 1939.
In 1969, MD 22 was transferred to the newly completed Aberdeen Thruway. MD 132 was assigned to MD 22's old alignment east of the I-95 interchange at that time. Beards Hill Road was reconstructed as a divided highway between MD 132 and MD 22 and the ramps from northbound I-95 to MD 132 and from eastbound MD 22 to MD 132 were constructed by 1972. MD 132's S-curve bridge over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor was completed in 1983, replacing Bel Air Avenue's at-grade crossing of the railroad. Bel Air Avenue east of the Amtrak line and Post Road south of MD 22 were removed from the state highway system around 1989.

Samson Slaying a Philistine

The sculpture of Samson Slaying a Philistine is the earliest of the great marble groups by Giambologna (1529-1608), sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany, and the only substantial work by the artist to have left Italy. It was commissioned in about 1562, by Francesco de Medici for a fountain in Florence, but was later sent as a gift to Spain. The group was presented to the Prince of Wales, later King Charles I, in 1623 while he was in Spain negotiating a marriage contract, and it soon became the most famous Italian sculpture in England. On its arrival in England it was given to the king's favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, and subsequently changed hands three times before coming to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1954.
The sculpture shows Samson wielding the jawbone of an ass in order to slay one of the Philistines who have taunted him. It is a good example of the multiple viewpoints seen in Giambologna's work; the spiralling movement of the bodies means that there is no main view. The dramatic pose is based on a composition by Michelangelo, who was in his late seventies when Giambologna met him in Rome. The group was carved from just one block of marble, supported by only five narrow points. Although the marble is weathered from three centuries outdoors, it still shows Giambologna's sensitive carving.

Jean-Baptiste Schacre (1808–1876) was a French architect.
Life.
Born in Delle in 1808, Jean-Baptiste Schacre began his career in 1826 as a draftsman in the Ponts et Chaussées services. During that period he drew many sketches and watercolours depicting Alsatian landscapes and monuments.

RTÉ Radio

RTÉ Radio is a department of Irish national broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann. RTÉ Radio broadcasts four analogue channels and five digital channels.
The first voice broadcast of 2RN, the original radio callsign for RTÉ Radio 1, took place on 14 November 1925 when Seamus Clandillon, the 2RN station director said, 'Seo Raidió 2RN, Baile Átha Cliath ag tástáil', Irish for 'This is Radio 2RN, Dublin calling'. Regular Irish radio-broadcasting began on 1 January 1926. Unfortunately, most Irish people could not receive 2RN's (1.5 kilowatt) signal. When faced with numerous complaints from Cork regarding the writers' inability to tune to the signal, Clandillon remarked in "The Irish Radio Review", a magazine dedicated to the service, that they did not know how to operate their sets. 6CK was established in Cork in 1927; however 6CK was mostly a relay of 2RN.
History.
A high power (initially 60 kW) station was established in Athlone, in 1932, to coincide with the staging of the Eucharistic Congress. 2RN, 6CK and Athlone became known as "Radio Athlone" or, in Irish, "Raidio Áth Luain" and were receivable across virtually the entire country. Radio Athlone became known as "Radio Éireann" in 1938.
Radio Éireann tried to satisfy all tastes on a single channel (with very limited programming hours). However, this resulted in a rather conservative programming policy. It was barely tolerated by most Irish listeners, and usually trounced (particularly on the east coast and along the Northern Ireland border) by the BBC and later Radio Luxembourg. This did not really change until Radio Éireann became free of direct government control in the 1960s.
In June 1969, work had begun on the new Radio Centre at Donnybrook. Construction of the building was finished in April 1971 and after a period of fitting-out and transition, live broadcasts began on 24 September 1973. By May 1974 the move from the GPO in O'Connell Street, (which had been the home of Irish radio since 1928), was complete.
Now, RTÉ has a nation-wide communications network with an increasing emphasis on regional news-gathering and input. Broadcasting on Radio 1 provides comprehensive coverage of news, current affairs, music, drama and variety features, agriculture, education, religion and sport, mostly in English but also some Irish. RTÉ 2fm is a popular music and chat channel which commenced broadcasting as RTÉ Radio 2 on 31 May 1979, Brendan Balfe being the first voice to be heard on the station at midday, when he introduced the first presenter, Larry Gogan. RTÉ lyric fm serves the interests of classical music and the arts, coming on air in May 1999, and replacing FM3 Classical Music, which had catered for the same target audience and time-shared with RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, an exclusively Irish language service, which first began broadcasting on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1972. Formerly RTÉ operated RTÉ Radio Cork (previously 'Cork 89FM' and 'RTÉ Cork Local Radio'), a local radio service in Cork, but this closed down in the early 2000s.
Future.
RTÉ operates multiplex 1 (block 12C) on the Irish digital radio platform (DAB), having launched nine digital-only channels from May 2007 as part of a trial to see what demand existed for new radio services. Most of the channels were an extension of the main Radio 1 and 2fm stations, focusing on particular genres. On 30 November 2008 the trial was brought to an end with the commercial multiplex (mux 2/block 12A) being suspended pending regulatory guidance, while RTÉ also changed the line up of its stations. The day after the end if the trial, two of the stations were turned off, with six being officially launched, namely RTÉ 2XM, RTÉ Chill/RTÉ Junior (timeshare), RTÉ Choice, RTÉ Gold, and RTÉ Pulse.
The two stations that were ended were RTÉ Digital Radio News, which played the most recent Radio 1 news bulletin on loop and RTÉ Playback, a listen again service with content from Radio 1 and 2fm. Despite not officially being launched, the RTÉ Radio 1 Extra service also continues to be broadcast, however the AM Radio 1 service has traditionally been used for opt-out programmes, although it was not called Radio 1 Extra until the trial.
At the moment, only 44% of the country is able to pick up the RTÉ DAB service, mainly in greater Dublin, Limerick and Cork areas. Despite this limited output from DAB, RTÉ's radio stations are broadcast on digital and cable television, and will also be included in the new digital terrestrial television (DTT) service to be launched in 2009.
A survey carried out by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs showed that demand for an Irish-language radio station aimed at a younger audience than RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta was high. This means that RTÉ might have plans to launch such a radio station.
Shortwave.
RTE from time to broadcasts on the Shortwave bands aimed at the Irish Diaspora, for example the RTE Radio One coverage of GAA All-Ireland Finals in recent years.
RTE Broadcasts one hour a day
Special Frequencies for GAA All Ireland Finals.
The Meyerton transmitter site in South Africa was used to relay this 17540kHz in 2012.

University of La Verne College of Law

The University of La Verne College of Law is a private, ABA-approved law school in Ontario, California. Founded in 1970, it is part of the University of La Verne and is the only ABA-approved law school in the Inland Empire.
History.
In 2001, the law school established a new campus in downtown Ontario. It is near the Ontario Civic Center and the city library.
It is not a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), but has paid a fee to receive AALS services.
Academic profile.
Degrees offered.
The school offers the Juris Doctor (JD) law degree. This requires 88 credits which can be done on a full-time basis over 3 years or on a part-time basis over 4 years.
The school also offers two dual degree programs in conjunction with the University of La Verne College of Business and Public Management, the Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration (JD/MBA) and Juris Doctor/Master of Public Administration (JD/MPA).
Accreditation and ABA approval.
On August 29, 2011, the school announced it received accreditation from the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California.
The College of Law first received provisional approval by the American Bar Association in 2006. Full approval was denied by the ABA in June 2011, as the first-time bar pass rate had not improved sufficiently. In March 2012, the ABA again granted provisional approval through 2017 following an extensive review of the law school’s program of legal education, faculty, admissions and student services, facilities and bar pass rate.
Post-Graduation Employment & Rankings.
Employment Outcomes: According to the law professor blog, "The Faculty Lounge", based on 2012 ABA data, only 35.6% of graduates obtained full-time, long term positions requiring bar admission (i.e., jobs as lawyers), 9 months after graduation, ranking 185th out of 197 law schools.
The school is "unranked" in the "U.S. News & World Report", "Best Law Schools" report. 
In "The National Jurist: The Magazine for Law Students", La Verne Law was listed with a "B+" in the March 2011 "Diversity Honor Roll".
Legal clinics and student programs.
The college of law opened a disability rights legal clinic in the Summer of 2007; it then opened a justice and immigration legal clinic. Additional programs for students include clinical externships and practicums in Family Law and Lawyering Skills.
Student loans.
The average Class of 2009 graduate had $101,237 of student loan debt.

Eleazer A. Paine

Eleazer Arthur Paine (September 10, 1815 – December 16, 1882) was an American soldier, author, and lawyer from Ohio who provoked controversy as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was formally reprimanded for brutality toward civilians and violating their civil rights while commanding troops in western Kentucky. He was replaced in April 1864 from his post, based in Gallatin, Tennessee, where he had directed the occupation's protection of railroads and policing civilians.
Early life and career.
Paine was born in Geauga County, Ohio. He was a first cousin to Halbert E. Paine, also born in that county and a fellow future Civil War general. 
After being educated in local schools, Paine received an appointment to the United States Military Academy and graduated in the Class of 1839. He served in the Seminole Wars before resigning his commission in 1840. In 1843, he wrote and published a training manual entitled "Military Instructions; Designed for the Militia and Volunteers".
Law career.
After resigning from the army, he returned to Ohio. There he "read the law" with an established firm. He passed the bar exam in 1843, and established his practice in Painesville, Ohio. 
In 1848 he moved further west to Monmouth, Illinois. There he married Charlotte Phelps and raised a family. One of Paine's close friends was fellow Illinois attorney Abraham Lincoln. Among Paine's children was a son Phelps.
Civil War.
Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Paine was elected as the colonel of the 9th Illinois Infantry. In September of that year, he was appointed as a brigadier general of volunteers. He commanded a brigade at Paducah, Kentucky, a critical supply depot for the Federal army. There, Paine developed a reputation for harshness and cruelty toward the civilian populace. He ordered all guerrilla fighters caught within his territory to be executed.
Paine commanded the 4th Division of the Army of the Mississippi at the Battle of New Madrid and Island Number Ten in Missouri leading the 1st Division. He also served in the Siege of Corinth under William S. Rosecrans. 
He subsequently headed the District of West Kentucky, where his men were deployed guarding railroads from Confederate raiders from November 1862 until April 1864. His headquarters were in Gallatin, Tennessee in the middle part of the state, and a center of regional railroads. Tennessee was occupied by Union troops from 1862 on. His son Phelps Paine was a captain in the Union Army and assigned to Gallatin. 
Paine's reputation grew for repressing and stealing from the civilians. In addition to executing suspected spies in the Gallatin town square, he was known for what was called "chasing the fox with fresh horses" - having his men chase down and kill prisoners who were set free on old horses. Gallatin civilians referred to him as "our King" and "Tempest". Executions of commonplace, typically without benefit of a trial or legal counsel. 
On April 29, 1864, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman reassigned Paine and a regiment of his infantry to a post in Tullahoma, Tennessee, to guard bridges crossing the Duck and Elk rivers. He later commanded the military District of Illinois, but resigned in November 1864 and was replaced by John Cook.
A Congressional inquiry into Paine's actions in Kentucky and Tennessee found him guilty on several counts. He was punished by reprimand at Paducah, Kentucky. He resigned from the Army in April 1865.
Postwar years.
Paine returned to his family in Illinois and resumed his law practice. 
Paine died in Jersey City, New Jersey. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery in St. Paul, Minnesota.
In some accounts, his first name is spelled as "Eleazar." It is also recorded as "Eleazor." Spelling was variable in the 19th century.

Bord na gCon

Bord na gCon (; in English, the Irish Greyhounds Board), abbreviated as BnaC, is an Irish semi-state body charged with regulating and promoting greyhound racing in Ireland. The board has been active in developing the sport in Ireland since its founding in 1958, but has also drawn criticism for acting independently of the government.
History.
Bord na gCon was established under the Greyhound Industry Act of 1958 with a number of aims. The body was formed to regulate the industry, operate a tote betting system, licence and authorise each stadium, its officials, and its on-course bookmakers, and promote the sport through advertising and prize grants. Bord na gCon received €14.5 million in state funding during 2007, but has been criticised for lacking government oversight. Bord na gCon has been active in improving Ireland's greyhound stadia in recent years, and in 2007 announced a €28 million investment in its facilities in Limerick and Kilkenny.
The board has long had a comprehensive policy on doping in the sport, even including viagra on its list of banned substances. However, in 2006 Bord na gCon was imbued with controversy. A report illustrating that two dogs had tested positive for the banned substance EPO was not made public by the board, contrary to standard practice. Aidan Tynan, the board's CEO at the time, sent a letter to the Minister for Sport, John O'Donoghue, outlining his concern with the situation. He was then removed from his position by the board. A government report subsequently criticised the board for its actions, and a 2008 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General found some irregularities in the board's accounts.
Stadia.
Bord na gCon regulates all of Ireland's greyhound stadia. There are stadia in the following locations:
Connacht
Leinster
Munster
Ulster

John P. Costas (engineer)

John Peter Costas (1923, Wabash, Indiana – 2008) was an American electrical engineer. 
Costas invented, among other things, the Costas loop and Costas arrays.
Biography.
Costas studied at Purdue University as an undergraduate. During World War II, he was involved in radar engineering, serving in the U.S. Navy as a radar officer. He was a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he worked on interference filtering 
and linear systems coding.
While there, he worked with Norbert Wiener, R. M. Fano, J. B. Wiesner and Y. W. Lee. He worked for General Electric from 1951 until the early 1980s, and for Cogent Systems, Inc. He was retired since then, and died on August 9, 2008.
Work.
During the 1950s, he invented the Costas loop, a type of phase locked loop, work which was described as having had "a profound effect on modern digital communications"
In the 1960s, he helped solve the mystery concerning poor performance of sonar systems. He found that the rapidly time-varying channel made coherent processing inappropriate. His solution involved a kind of permutation array, now known as a Costas array, which has ideal properties for the problem. 
Costas was made a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1965 for "contributions to communications theory and techniques."

The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), also called the "Child Care and Development Fund", is the primary source of United States federal funding for child care subsidies for low-income working families and funds to improve child care quality.
Some States also provide child care assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. States design their own child care assistance programs within minimal federal guidelines.
Child care assistance helps families succeed financially. When families receive child care assistance they are more likely to be employed and to have higher earnings. Approximately 1.8 million children receive CCDBG-funded child care in an average month. Yet, only one in seven eligible children receives child care assistance.
CCDBG was funded at nearly $5 billion in FY 2008; state are required to provide an additional $2 billion.

Ancient maritime history

Maritime history dates back thousands of years. In ancient maritime history, evidence of maritime trade between civilizations dates back at least two millennia. The first prehistoric boats are presumed to have been dugout canoes which were developed independently by various stone age populations. In ancient history, various vessels were used for coastal fishing and travel.
The Arabian Sea has been an important marine trade route since the era of the "coastal sailing vessels" from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, certainly the late 2nd millennium BCE through later days known as the Age of Sail. By the time of Julius Caesar, several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon water transport through the sea around the rough inland terrain features to its north. Navigation was known in Sumer between the 4th and the 3rd millennium BCE, and was probably known by the Indians and the Chinese people before the Sumerians. The Egyptians had trade routes through the Red Sea, importing spices from the "Land of Punt" (East Africa) and from Arabia.
Ancient Seafaring.
Maritime prehistory.
The Indigenous of the Pacific Northwest are very skilled at crafting wood. Best known for totem poles up to tall, they also construct dugout canoes over long for everyday use and ceremonial purposes.
The earliest seaworthy boats may have been developed as early as 45,000 years ago, according to one hypothesis explaining the habitation of Australia. Humans used boats for travel and eventually for food resources. In the history of whaling, humans began whaling in pre-historic times. The oldest known method of catching whales is to simply drive them ashore by placing a number of small boats between the whale and the open sea and attempting to frighten them with noise, activity, and perhaps small, non-lethal weapons such as arrows. Typically, this was used for small species, such as Pilot Whales, Belugas and Narwhals.
Over thousands of years of human migrations and the rise of ancient civilizations, seafaring exploration led to ocean trade routes. The earliest known reference to an organization devoted to ships in ancient India is to the Mauryan Empire from the 4th century BC. It is believed that the navigation as a science originated on the river Indus some 5000 years ago.
Ancient routes and locations.
Ancient maritime routes usually began in the Far East or down river from Madhya Pradesh with transshipment via historic Bharuch (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's Iran then split around Hadhramaut into two streams north into the Gulf of Aden and thence into the Levant, or south into Alexandria via Red Sea ports such as Axum. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates.
Maritime trade began with safer coastal trade and evolved with the manipulation of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.
Egypt.
The Ancient Egyptians had knowledge of sail construction. This is governed by the science of aerodynamics. A primary feature of a properly designed sail is an amount of "draft", caused by curvature of the surface of the sail. Hannu was an ancient Egyptian explorer (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition and wrote his account of the exploration in stone. He traveled along the Red Sea to Punt and sailed to what is now part of eastern Ethiopia and Somalia. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious myrrh, metal and wood. It must be said also about warships. Undoubtedly, warships of Ancient Egypt began in the early Middle Kingdom, and perhaps - at the end of the Old Kingdom, but the first mention and a detailed description of a large enough and heavily armed ship dates from XVI BC.
"And I ordered to build twelve warships with rams, dedicated to Amun or Sobek, or Maat and Sekhmet, whose image was crowned best bronze noses. Carport and equipped outside rook over the waters, for many paddlers, having covered rowers deck not only from the side, but and top. and they were on board eighteen oars in two rows on the top and sat on two rowers, and the lower - one, a hundred and eight rowers were. And twelve rowers aft worked on three steering oars. And blocked Our Majesty ship inside three partitions (bulkheads) so as not to drown it by ramming the wicked, and the sailors had time to repair the hole. And Our Majesty arranged four towers for archers - two behind, and two on the nose and one above the other small - on the mast with narrow loopholes. they are covered with bronze in the fifth finger (3.2mm), as well as a canopy roof and its rowers. and they have (carried) on the nose three assault heavy crossbow arrows so they lit resin or oil with a salt of Seth (probably nitrate) tore a special blend and punched (?) lead ball with a lot of holes (?), and one of the same at the stern. and long ship seventy five cubits (41m), and the breadth sixteen, and in battle can go three-quarters of iteru per hour (about 6.5 knots)..." The text of the tomb of Amenhotep I (KV-39). 
When Thutmose III achieved warships displacement up to 360 tons and carried up to ten new heavy and light to seventeen catapults based bronze springs, called "siege crossbow" - more precisely, siege bows. Still appeared giant catamarans that are heavy warships and times of Ramesses III used even when the Ptolemaic dynasty.
According to the Greek historian Herodotus, Necho II sent out an expedition of Phoenicians, which in three years sailed from the Red Sea around Africa to the mouth of the Nile. At some point between 610 and before 594 BC, Necho reputedly commissioned an expedition of Phoenicians, who it is said in three years sailed from the Red Sea around Africa back to the mouth of the Nile. Some Egyptologists dispute that an Egyptian Pharaoh would authorize such an expedition, except for the reason of trade in the ancient maritime routes.
The belief in Herodotus' account, handed down to him by oral tradition, is primarily because he stated with disbelief that the Phoenicians ""as they sailed on a westerly course round the southern end of Libya (Africa), they had the sun on their right - to northward of them"" ("The Histories" 4.42) -- in Herodotus' time it was not generally known that Africa was surrounded by an ocean (with the southern part of Africa being thought connected to Asia). So fantastic an assertion is this of a typical example of some seafarers' story and Herodotus therefore may never have mentioned it, at all, had it not been based on facts and made with the according insistence.
This early description of Necho's expedition as a whole is contentious, though; it is recommended that one keep an open mind on the subject; but Strabo, Polybius, and Ptolemy doubted the description. Egyptologist A. B. Lloyd suggests that the Greeks at this time understood that anyone going south far enough and then turning west would have the Sun on their right but found it unbelievable that Africa reached so far south. He suggests that "It is extremely unlikely that an Egyptian king would, or could, have acted as Necho is depicted as doing" and that the story might have been triggered by the failure of Sataspes' attempt to circumnavigate Africa under Xerxes the Great. Regardless, it was believed by Herodotus and Pliny.
Much earlier, the Sea Peoples was a confederacy of seafaring raiders who sailed into the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, caused political unrest, and attempted to enter or control Egyptian territory during the late 19th dynasty, and especially during Year 8 of Ramesses III of the 20th Dynasty. The Egyptian Pharaoh Merneptah explicitly refers to them by the term "the foreign-countries (or 'peoples') of the sea" in his Great Karnak Inscription. Although some scholars believe that they "invaded" Cyprus, Hati and the Levant, this hypothesis is disputed.
Kingdom of Punt.
In ancient times the Kingdom of Punt, which is believed by several Egyptologists to have been situated in the area of modern-day Somalia, had a steady trade link with the Ancient Egyptians and exported the precious natural resources such as myrrh, frankincense and gum. This trade network continued all the way into the classical era. The city states of Mossylon, Opone, Malao, Mundus and Tabae in Somalia engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.
The Mediterranean.
Minoan traders from Crete were active in the eastern Mediterranean by the 2nd millennium BC. The Phoenicians were an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient Canaan, with its heartland along the coast of modern day Lebanon, Syria and northern Israel. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean during the first millennium BC, between the period of 1200 BC to 900 BC. Though ancient boundaries of such city-centered cultures fluctuated, the city of Tyre seems to have been the southernmost. Sarepta between Sidon and Tyre, is the most thoroughly excavated city of the Phoenician homeland. The Phoenicians often traded by means of a galley, a man-powered sailing vessel. They were the first civilization to create the bireme. There is still debate on the subject of whether the Canaanites and Phoenicians were different peoples or not.
The Mediterranean was the source of the vessel, galley, developed before 1000 BC, and development of nautical technology supported the expansion of Mediterranean culture. The Greek trireme was the most common ship of the ancient Mediterranean world, employing the propulsion power of oarsmen. Mediterranean peoples developed lighthouse technology and built large fire-based lighthouses, most notably the Lighthouse of Alexandria, built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247 BC) on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt.
Many in ancient western societies, such as Ancient Greece, were in awe of the seas and deified them, believing that man no longer belonged to himself when once he embarked on a sea voyage. They believed that he was liable to be sacrificed at any time to the anger of the great Sea God. Before the Greeks, the Carians were an early Mediterranean seagoing people that travelled far. Early writers do not give a good idea about the progress of navigation nor that of the man's seamanship. One of the early stories of seafaring was that of Odysseus.
In Greek mythology, the Argonauts were a band of heroes who, in the years before the Trojan War, accompanied Jason to Colchis in his quest to find the Golden Fleece. Their name comes from their ship, the Argo which in turn was named after its builder Argus. Thus, "Argonauts" literally means "Argo sailors". The voyage of the Greek navigator Pytheas of Massalia is an example of a very early voyage. A competent astronomer and geographer, Pytheas ventured from Greece to Western Europe and the British Isles.
The "periplus", literally "a sailing-around', in the ancient navigation of Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans was a manuscript document that listed in order the ports and coastal landmarks, with approximate distances between, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore. Several examples of "periploi" have survived.
The concept of an underwater boat has roots deep in antiquity. The very first report of someone attempting to put the idea into practice seems to have been an attempt by Alexander the Great. According to Aristotle, Alexander the Great had developed a primitive submersible for reconnaissance missions by 332BC.
"Piracy", which is a robbery committed at sea or sometimes on the shore, dates back to Classical Antiquity and, in all likelihood, much further. The Tyrrhenians, Illyrians and Thracians were known as pirates in ancient times. The island of Lemnos long resisted Greek influence and remained a haven for Thracian pirates. By the 1st century BC, there were pirate states along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire.
The Persian Wars.
In Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of Turkey) the Greek cities, which included great centres such as Miletus and Halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid-6th century BC. In 499 BC the Greeks rose in the Ionian Revolt, and Athens and some other Greek cities went to their aid. In 490 BC, the Persian Great King, Darius I, having suppressed the Ionian cities, sent a fleet to punish the Greeks. The Persians landed in Attica, but were defeated at the Battle of Marathon by a Greek army led by the Athenian general Miltiades. The burial mound of the Athenian dead can still be seen at Marathon. Ten years later Darius' successor, Xerxes I, sent a much more powerful force by land. After being delayed by the Spartan King Leonidas I at Thermopylae, Xerxes advanced into Attica, where he captured and burned Athens. But the Athenians had evacuated the city by sea, and under Themistocles they defeated the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis. A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan Pausanias, defeated the Persian army at Plataea. The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians out of the Aegean Sea, and in 478 BC they captured Byzantium. In the course of doing so Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland allies into an alliance, called the Delian League because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos. The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation after it, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power.
Achaean League.
The Achaean League was a confederation of Greek city states in Achaea, a territory on the northern coast of the Peloponnese. An initial confederation existed during the 5th through the 4th centuries BC. The Achaean League was reformed early in the 3rd century BC, and soon expanded beyond its Achaean heartland. The League's dominance was not to last long, however. During the Third Macedonian War (171-168 BC), the League flirted with the idea of an alliance with Perseus, and the Romans punished it by taking several hostages to ensure good behavior, including Polybius, the Hellenistic historian who wrote about the rise of the Roman Empire. In 146 BC, the league erupted into open revolt against Roman domination. The Romans under Lucius Mummius defeated the Achaeans, razed Corinth and dissolved the league. Lucius Mummius received the cognomen "Achaicus" ("conqueror of Achaea") for his role.
Ancient Rome.
Ancient Rome was a civilization that grew from a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula c. the 9th century BC to a massive empire straddling the Mediterranean Sea. In its twelve-century existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy, to a republic based on a combination of oligarchy and democracy, to an autocratic empire. It came to dominate Western Europe and the entire area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea through conquest and assimilation.
Punic Wars.
The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage. The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing Carthaginian Empire and the expanding Roman sphere of influence. The Romans were initially interested in expansion via Sicily, part of which lay under Carthaginian control. At the start of the first Punic War, Carthage was the dominant power of the Mediterranean, with an extensive maritime empire, while Rome was the rapidly ascending power in Italy. By the end of the third war, after the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of soldiers from both sides, Rome had conquered Carthage's empire and razed the city, becoming in the process the most powerful state of the Western Mediterranean. With the end of the Macedonian wars — which ran concurrently with the Punic wars — and the defeat of the Seleucid Emperor Antiochus III the Great in the Roman-Syrian War (Treaty of Apamea, 188 BC) in the eastern sea, Rome emerged as the dominant Mediterranean power and the most powerful city in the classical world. This was a turning point that meant that the civilization of the ancient Mediterranean would pass to the modern world via Europe instead of Africa.
Pre-Roman Britain.
The Coracle, a small single-passenger-sized float, has been used in Britain since before the first Roman invasion as noted by the invaders. Coracles are round or oval in shape, made of a wooden frame with a hide stretched over it then tarred to provide waterproofing. Being so light, an operator can carry the light craft over the shoulder. They are capable of operating in mere inches of water due to the keel-less hull. The early people of Wales used these boats for fishing and light travel and updated models are still in use to this day on the rivers of Scotland and Wales.
Early Britons also used the world-common hollowed tree trunk canoe. Examples of these canoes have been found buried in marshes and mud banks of rivers at lengths of upward eight feet.
In 1992 a notable archaeological find, named the "Dover Bronze Age Boat", was unearthed from beneath what is modern day Dover, England. The Bronze Age boat which is about 9.5 meters long × 2.3 meters is determined to have been a seagoing vessel. Carbon dating reveals that the craft dating from approximately 1600 BC. is the oldest known ocean-going boat. The hull was of half oak logs and side panels also of oak were stitched on with yew lashings. Both the straight-grained oak and yew bindings are now extinct as a shipbuilding method in England. A reconstruction in 1996 proved that a crew between four and sixteen paddlers could have easily propelled the boat during Force 4 winds upwards of four knots but with a maximum of . The boat could have easily carried a significant amount of cargo and with a strong crew may have been able to traverse near thirty nautical miles in a day.
Northern Europe.
The "Norsemen", or 'people from the North', were people from southern and central Scandinavia which established states and settlements Northern Europe from the late 8th century to the 11th century.
Vikings has been a common term for Norsemen in the early medieval period, especially in connection with raids and monastic plundering made by Norsemen in Great Britain and Ireland.
Leif Ericson was an Icelandic explorer known to be the first European to have landed in North America (presumably in Newfoundland, Canada). During a stay in Norway, Leif Ericsson converted to Christianity, like many Norse of that time. He also went to Norway to serve the King of Norway, Olaf Tryggvason. When he returned to Greenland, he bought the boat of Bjarni Herjólfsson and set out to explore the land that Bjarni had found (located west of Greenland), which was, in fact, Newfoundland, in Canada. The "Saga of the Greenlanders" tells that Leif set out around the year 1000 to follow Bjarni's route with 15 crew members, but going north.
Indian subcontinent.
In the Indian maritime history, the world's first tidal dock was built in phase II of Lothal during the Harappan civilisation near the present day Mangrol harbour on the Gujarat coast. Other ports were probably at Balakot and Dwarka. However, it is probable that many small-scale ports, and not massive ports, were used for the Harappan maritime trade. Ships from the harbour at these ancient port cities established trade with Mesopotamia, where the Indus Valley was known as Meluhha.
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya's Prime Minister Kautilya's Arthashastra devotes a full chapter on the state department of waterways under "navadhyaksha" (Sanskrit for Superintendent of ships) . The term, "nava dvipantaragamanam" (Sanskrit for sailing to other lands by ships) appears in this book in addition to appearing in the Buddhist text, "Baudhayana Dharmasastra" as the interpretation of the term, "Samudrasamyanam".
The Tamil Chola Empire possessed the largest naval force of Indian subcontinent to have util modern time and represented the zenith of ancient Indian sea power. Chola Emperor Rajendra Chola had established his rule extending up from India(coramandal coast or present day coast of southern part of Andhrapradesh and Tamilnadu) to South East Asia with his impressive Chola Navy. Rajendra Chola annexed during his overseas conquests Sri Lanka, Maldives, islands of Andaman, Nicobar, Lakshadweep, parts of the Malay Peninsula and Indonesian archipelago. Through conquest of the Srivijaya Empire, the Cholas secured the sea trade road to China.
China.
In ancient China, during the Spring and Autumn Period (722 BC–481 BC), large rectangular-based barge-like ships with layered decks and cabins with ramparts acted as floating fortresses on wide rivers and lakes. These were called 'castle ships' ('lou chuan'), yet there were 4 other ship types known in that period, including a ramming vessel. During the short-lived Qin Dynasty (221 BC-207 BC) the Chinese sailed south into the South China Sea during their invasion of Annam, modern Vietnam.
During the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD), a ship with a stern-mounted steering rudder along with masts and sails was innovated, known as the junk in Western terminology. The Chinese had been sailing through the Indian Ocean since the 2nd century BC, with their travels to Kanchipuram in India. This was followed up by many recorded maritime travelers following the same route to India, including Faxian, Zhiyan, Tanwujie, etc. Like in the Western tradition, the earlier Zhou Dynasty Chinese also made use of the floating pontoon bridge, which became a valuable means to blockade the entire Yangtze River during Gongsun Shu's rebellion against the re-established Han government in 33 AD. Although first described in ancient Ptolemaic Egypt, the Song Dynasty scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was the first to describe the use of the drydock system in China to repair boats out of water. The canal pound lock was invented in China during the previous century, while Shen Kuo wrote of its effectiveness in his day, writing that ships no longer had the grievances of the old flash lock design and no longer had to be hauled over long distances (meaning heavier ships with heavier cargo of goods could traverse the waterways of China). There were many other improvements to nautical technology during the Song period as well, including crossbeams bracing the ribs of ships to strengthen them, rudders that could be raised or lowered to allow ships to travel in a wider range of water depths, and the teeth of anchors arranged circularly instead of in one direction, "making them more reliable".
Although there were numerous naval battles beforehand, China's first permanent standing navy was established in 1132 during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). Gunpowder warfare at sea was also first known in China, with battles such as the Battle of Caishi and the Battle of Tangdao on the Yangtze River in 1161 AD during the Jin–Song wars. One of the most important books of medieval maritime literature was Zhu Yu's "Pingzhou Table Talks" of 1119 AD. Although the Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass, Zhu Yu's book was the first to specify its use for navigation at sea. Zhu Yu's book also described watertight bulkhead compartments in the hull of Chinese ships, which prevented sinking when heavily damaged in one compartment. Although the drydock was known, Zhu Yu wrote of expert divers who were often used to repair boats that were damaged and still submersed in water. Divers in China continued to have a maritime significance, as the later Ming Dynasty author Song Yingxing (1587–1666) wrote about pearl divers who used snorkeling gear (a watertight leather face mask and breathing tube secured with tin rings) to breathe underwater while tied by the waist to the ship in order to be secure while hunting for pearls.
Japan.
Japan had a navy by at least the 6th century, with their invasions and involvement in political alliances during the Three Kingdoms of Korea. A joint alliance between the Korean Silla Kingdom and the Chinese Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) heavily defeated the Japanese and their Korean allies of Baekje in the Battle of Baekgang on August 27 to August 28 of the year 663 AD. This decisive victory expelled the Japanese force from Korea and allowed the Tang and Silla to conquer Goguryeo.

Unique sink orientation

In mathematics, a unique sink orientation is an orientation of the edges of a polytope such that, in every face of the polytope (including the whole polytope as one of the faces), there is exactly one vertex for which all adjoining edges are oriented inward (i.e. towards that vertex). If a polytope is given together with a linear objective function, and edges are oriented from vertices with smaller objective function values to vertices with larger objective values, the result is a unique sink orientation. Thus, unique sink orientations can be used to model linear programs as well as certain nonlinear programs such as the smallest circle problem.
The problem of finding the sink in a unique sink orientation of a hypercube was formulated as an abstraction of linear complementarity problems by .
It is possible for an algorithm to determine the unique sink of a -dimensional hypercube in time for , substantially smaller than the time required to examine all vertices. When the orientation has the additional property that the orientation forms a directed acyclic graph, which happens when unique sink orientations are used to model LP-type problems, it is possible to find the sink using a randomized algorithm in expected time exponential in the square root of "d" .

Dixie's BBQ

Dixie's BBQ is a popular barbecue restaurant at 11522 Northup Way, Bellevue, Washington, 98004. It gained notoriety for its hot sauce, "The Man", and bumper stickers throughout the area which read, "Have you met The Man?" It was opened in 1994 by Dixie and Gene Porter, who had lived in the Seattle, Washington area for 30 years, working as a nurse and a mechanic, respectively. (The sign outside still reads "Porter's Automotive".) Dixie Porter continues to serve authentic barbecue, Tuesday through Saturday, 11:00 AM to 4:30 PM. 
Location and features.
The restaurant is located in a converted auto-repair garage; seating is at picnic tables around the repair bays and outside. Food is served in Styrofoam containers with plastic utensils. The walls are covered with maps of Washington State, the US, and the world, to which are affixed thousands of pins, each representing where a customer is from. The maps soon became completely filled with pins, and got 'retired' to the upper part of the wall. Porter himself would usually walk among the lunch crowd with the saucepan shown in the above photo, asking people his trademark question, 'Have you met The Man?'.
Notorious for its heat, "The Man" was Porter's own hot sauce recipe, which seemed to be made of nothing but the ribs and seeds of various types of peppers. Patrons unfamiliar with "The Man" would often challenge Porter's sauce and regret it, as he would then spoon a dollop onto whatever they were eating, and even if they were beaten by the sauce (which happened often), Porter would insist that they not waste it. In true Southern fashion, he would shame them into finishing every bite, whether or not they felt they were up to the task.
Gene Porter's death.
Gene Porter died of cancer on February 28, 2010. His wife Dixie and daughter LJ continued to operate Dixie's until LJ died on February 2, 2011. Dixie carries on the business in the original location. Gene and Dixie also had a son, Alton Porter, who owned his own catering business, named Porter's Place. On June 28, 2012, Alton Porter, Gene's and Dixie's son, died of a heart attack. Porter's Place is no longer open.

Pidyon Shvuyim

The Mitzvah of Pidyon Shvuyim (, literally: Redemption of Captives) is to bring about the release of any Jew held captive by gentiles. It is considered an important commandment in the Jewish Halakha.
Limitations in the Practice of the Mitzvah.
Despite the importance of the Mitzvah, it should be performed within a number of boundaries, the most significant of which is:
“One does not ransom captives for more than their value because of Tikkun Olam (literally: “fixing the world”; for the good order of the world; as a precaution for the general good) and one does not help captives escape because of Tikkun Olam.” (Mishna, Gittin 4:6)
One of the aims of this restriction is to avoid encouraging kidnappers, or those seeking financial gain by capturing Jews and demanding a Kofer (a ransom) in exchange, due to the knowledge of how sensitive Jews are to rescuing their prisoners at any price. There are certain instances in which this restriction does not apply, such as when a man wishes to pay an excessive sum for his freedom, or when the prisoner is a Talmid Chacham, or when a husband is attempting to earn the freedom of his wife (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 252:4).
A prominent example of the practice of this restriction in reality was the affair of the arrest of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, a Gadol of Ashkenazi Jewry in the 13th Century, who is said to have forbidden his pidyon from prison citing the aforementioned restriction, despite the fact that according to the Halakha it was permitted to pay a substantial sum for his release.
Another restriction is that if a person repeatedly causes his own capture time after time, a pidyon is no longer required after the third time. This refers to a situation in which a person has sold himself, or has been taken to prison due to a crime committed intentionally. This restriction only applies when the life of the captive is not in danger; if his captors desire to kill him, a pidyon is mandatory.
Present.
The question of Pidyon Shvuyim, and particularly the amount of ransom to be paid, is a controversial issue in Israel, when captured Israeli soldiers are to be liberated or exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. 
In April 2010, several American and Canadian haredi rabbis from different Jewish sects released a public pronouncement (Kol Koreh), asking for Pidyon Shvuyim on behalf of former kosher meat plant Agriprocessors′ top manager Sholom Rubashkin, a Lubavitcher Hasid, awaiting sentencing after being convicted on 86 charges of financial fraud in November 2009 by a Federal Court in Iowa, U.S.A.
