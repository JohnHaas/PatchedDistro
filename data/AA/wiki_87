2004 Sidecarcross World Championship

The 2004 FIM Sidecarcross World Championship, the 25th edition of the competition, started on 21 March 2004 and finished after fourteen race weekends on 5 September 2004 with Daniël Willemsen and Kaspars Stupelis taking out the title once more. For Willemsen, it was his third world championship while it was the second for Stupelis.
The season saw the cancellation of the Russian GP in Moscow on 15 August because of heavy rainfall, thereby reducing the schedule to thirteen GP's and 26 races.
Overview.
The 2004 season was the 25th edition of the sidcarcross world championship. It resulted in a third world championship for Daniël Willemsen, his second in a row with passenger Kaspars Stupelis. Five time world champion Kristers Sergis, with Sven Verbrugge as his passenger, was their main rival early on in the competition. An injury to Sergis meant however, the pair would miss five race weekends and be out of contention for the championship. After this, Willemsen / Stupelis won the championship almost undisputed. For the following season, 2005, Willemsen and Sergis would exchange passenger, with Sven Verbrugge returning to Willemsen, who he had raced with before, while Sergis / Stupelis would form an all-Latvian team.
The fourteen GP's of the season were held in eleven countries, Spain, France (2x), Netherlands, Germany (2x), Italy, Estonia, Latvia (2x), Croatia, Bulgaria, Russia and Belgium. It was the first time that a GP was to be held in Russia.
Format.
Every Grand Prix weekend is split into two races, both held on the same day. This means, the 2004 season with its fourteen Grand Prix had originally 28 races. Each race lasts for 30 minutes plus two laps. The two races on a weekend actually get combined to determined an overall winner. While this overall winners receives no extra WC points, they usually are awarded a special trophy. 
The first twenty teams of each race score competition points. The point system for the 2004 season was as follows:

Somebody to Love (30 Rock)

"Somebody to Love" is the sixth episode of the second season of "30 Rock", and the twenty-seventh episode overall. It was written by Kay Cannon and the series' creator, Tina Fey, and was directed by Beth McCarthy. The episode first aired on November 15, 2007 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Hamza Ahmed, Fred Armisen, Kevin Brown, Chris Caniglia, Grizz Chapman, Matthieu Cornillon, Michael Devine, Edie Falco, John Lutz, Maulik Pancholy, Christianne Tisdale and Kristen Wiig.
The episode focuses on Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) first meeting with Celeste "C.C." Cunningham (Edie Falco); Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) believes that her new neighbor, Raheem Haddad (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist; and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) accidentally loses a pair of Jack's trousers.
Plot.
At a party in honor of Robert Novak, which is being thrown by John McCain and Jack Bauer, Jack Donaghy meets C.C., the Democratic congresswoman for Vermont. After the party, Jack and C.C. go back to Jack's apartment and have sex together. The following morning, Jack discovers that C.C. is suing the Sheinhardt Wig Company, the fictional subsidiary of General Electric (GE) and owner of NBC, the company that Jack works for. This is because the company is allegedly leaking Auburn Fantasy Dye Number 260 into the Chicktaugua River, causing the children of Chickataugua to turn orange. After discovering that Jack works for GE, C.C. leaves and goes to work at Bill Clinton's office in Harlem. Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), follow her there and Jack and C.C. decide to carry on their relationship in secret.
Liz is worried when she smells maple syrup in her apartment and Jack tells her that it could be the chemical agent Northrax. She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps in his apartment and she has seen him and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an agility course in the park. Liz is shocked to discover that the pair are auditioning for "The Amazing Race" and, in fact, not terrorists. 
After bringing Jack's suit back from the dry cleaners, Kenneth discovers that he has lost the suit's trousers. Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James "Toofer" Spurlock (Keith Powell) and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) pay him to complete various dares so that he can pay for a new pair of trousers.
Production.
Fred Armisen and Kristen Wiig, who play Raheem and Candace Van der Shark in the episode, have both appeared in the main cast of "Saturday Night Live", a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on "Saturday Night Live" from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of "Saturday Night Live" have appeared on "30 Rock", including Rachel Dratch, Will Forte, Jason Sudeikis, Molly Shannon and Chris Parnell. Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of "Saturday Night Live". Alec Baldwin has also hosted "Saturday Night Live" fifteen times, the highest amount of episodes of any host of the series.
This episode was the second episode, after "Greenzo", to air since the start of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on November 5, 2007 and ended on February 12, 2008, 100 days later. This episode was the first to contain reference to the strike. The reference occurs when C.C. is being interviewed on MSNBC and the news crawl below reads "News crawl affected by writers strike. Using repeat text from previous season." This episode was filmed in early October, 2007. This was the ninth episode written by Tina Fey and the second written by Kay Cannon. It was the third episode directed by Beth McCarthy.
Reception.
"Somebody to Love" brought in an average of 6.4 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 3.2/8 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic, the highest result in that demographic since the episode "SeinfeldVision" aired on October 4, 2007. The 3.2 refers to 3.2% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S., and the 8 refers to 8% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S.. "30 Rock" ranked in first place in the male 18–34 demographic, for its 8:30 p.m9:00 pm timeslot.
Robert Canning of IGN thought that the episode "was "30 Rock"'s best episode of the season far, if not the best episode ever from this young series." Canning also said that "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of "30 Rock". It was also an episode that once again proved the character of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." Canning rated this episode "9.5 out of 10." Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" wrote that "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell "juuuuuuust" a bit short. It's almost as if the funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by Wiig in the Lifetime movie." He thought that "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." Jeff Labrecque of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "Overall, [this was another splendid . My only beef was with the Verizon bit. "30 Rock" normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, and it seemed to me like the show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too."
Beth McCarthy, the director of this episode, was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series.

The village was founded on 10 April 1932 as a kibbutz. It was named for Rabbi Ze'ev Yavetz, a founder of the Mizrachi movement. 
The kibbutz was destroyed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The residents resettled in Geulei Teiman and the village was rebuilt as a moshav in 1951.
Kfar Yavetz is located in the heart of the Triangle, near the Wadi Ara highway.
On July 7, 2003, Mazal Afari, 65, a resident of Kfar Yavetz was killed in her home in a suicide bombing carried out by the Islamic Jihad.

Sxy 5' UTR element

The Sxy 5' UTR element is an RNA element that controls expression of the sxy gene in "H. influenzae". The sxy gene is a transcription factor (also known as TfoX) that regulates competence which is the ability of bacteria to take up DNA from their environment. When the sxy gene is deleted the bacterium loses the ability to express genes in the competence regulon. Cameron "et al." recently showed that mutations in the 5' end of the sxy gene lead to hypercompetance. They showed that this region formed an RNA secondary structure that occludes the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Mutations that interfere with the stability of this secondary structure lead to increased translation of sxy followed by upregulation of the competence regulon.
tfoR RNA.
In the fellow gammaproteobacterium "Vibrio cholera", a different RNA regulatory system is used. Here, an sRNA named 'tfoR' positively regulates expression of the sxy (tfoX) protein.
The RNA element responds to chitin, which is an important regulator of competence in "V. cholera". Deletion of tfoR removed all competence for exogenous DNA in "V. cholera" "in vivo".

Tommy Searle

Tommy Searle (born June 13, 1989 in Pembury) is a British motocross racer who competes in the MX1-GP Motocross World Championship for the Team Floride Monster Energy Kawasaki Pro Circuit team.
First stint In The FIM MX-GP2 Series.
Searle debuted in the FIM MX2-GP series in 2006, and managed to secure an eighth place finish overall for the season, despite only being 17 years of age. Dirt Bike Rider magazine subsequently described him as 'the brightest prospect to emerge from the Motocross World Championships this season'.
2007.
In 2007, Searle continued to compete in the FIM MX2-GP Motocross World Championship, and confirmed his status as one of the best young talents in world motocross by securing a second place finish overall for the season, including moto wins at the Grand Prix of Sweden and Great Britain, and seven podium finishes.
2008.
2008 saw Searle race to his most successful season to date, as he once again finished in second place overall in the MX2-GP Motocross World Championship. He remained in contention for first place until the last race of the season, but was edged out by South African rider Tyla Rattray. However, he won the Grand Prixs of Bulgaria, France, the Czech Republic and Citta di Faenza, and also scored podium finishes in Portugal, Italy, Great Britain, South Africa, Ireland and Benelux.
In January 2008, Searle signed a contract with KTM North America to compete in the AMA 2009 AMA MX Lites series. Pit Beirer, director of off-road racing at KTM, said of Searle 'His riding and rate of progression make him an excellent member of our MX2 team and we are now excited for his future achievements in the US'.
Stint In The AMA Supercross/Motocross Nationals Series.
In his first season racing in the U.S., Searle finished in 6th place in the 250 class of the 2009 AMA Motocross Championship. He made the podium three times, finishing 3rd overall at Mt. Morris, Lakewood and Buchanan. Searle had previously told www.motorcycle-usa.com that he was hoping to finish in the top three for the season.
However, Searle's debut Supercross season ended early when he injured his shoulder at the Anaheim Two meeting on January 23
. In the two rounds in which he competed before the injury, Searle finished 7th overall at the Anaheim One meeting,
In 2010 Searle embarked on his second season in the 250 class of the AMA Motocross Championship. But once again his progress was hampered by injury, after missing a number of races. His best result was a second place in the first moto of the opening round at Hangtown.
Second stint In The FIM MX-GP2 Series.
In August 2010, Searle left KTM and announced a return to the FIM MX-GP2 circuit with the CLS Monster Energy Kawasaki Pro Circuit team.
2011.
Searle finished a strong third overall for the 2011 season, behind Redbull Teka KTM riders Ken Roczen and Jeffrey Herlings. He secured overall wins at the Grand Prix of France and Europe, and also managed to finish on the podium at the Grand Prix of Bulgaria, Netherlands, the United States, Spain, Germany, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Britain and Italy. While fast throughout, he was often hindered by poor starts, meaning he would lose time by having to fight his way through the pack in the early laps of a moto, allowing the leaders - usually Roczen and Herlings - to pull away.
2012.
In his final season in the MX-GP2 class, Searle once again finished runner-up in the championship standings, this time to Red Bull KTM Factory Racing Team rider Jeffrey Herlings. Mechanical DNFs in the first moto of the Italian GP, and in both motos of the Latvian GP, ultimately cost him his chance of taking the title. However, he still managed to secure overall wins at the GPs of Bulgaria, Brazil, Belgium, Sweden, Great Britain and Germany, and finished on the podium a further seven times, for a total of 13 podium finishes out of 16 GPs. 
His victory at the GP of Great Britain in August 2012, the 13th of his career, saw he become - at the age of only 23 - the third most successful British motocross GP rider of all time in terms of number of GPs won, behind only former world champions Dave Thorpe and Jeff Smith.
Stint In The FIM MX-GP1 Series.
In 2013, Searle remained with Team Floride Monster Energy Pro-Circuit Kawasaki, and embarked upon his first season in the premier MX-GP1 class. The opening round of the season saw Qatar host its first ever MX-GP event, in which Searle finished 6th overall. Similarly, round two also saw Thailand host its first ever MX-GP event, in which Searle finished 4th overall. In round three, the series returned to the more established climes of the Valkenswaad circuit in the Netherlands, in which Searle finished 9th overall.

Matthew Watkins

Matthew Jason Watkins (born 2 September 1978) is a former Wales international rugby union footballer who played as a centre. He is commonly known by the name Matthew J. Watkins to avoid confusion with another Welsh rugby union player of the same name.
Born in Newport, Watkins began his rugby career with Newbridge and Pontllanfraith before going professional with Newport in 1997. After scoring 35 tries (175 points) in 121 appearances over five seasons with the club, Watkins was signed by Llanelli. He was then part of the team at the dawn of regional rugby in Wales in 2003 and was part of the original Llanelli Scarlets regional side.
By 2007, he had become only the third player to reach 100 appearances for the region, following lock Adam Jones and prop John Davies. Watkins signed for Gloucester at the end of the 2007–08 season, mid-way through a three-year contract with the Scarlets.
On 3 August 2009, it was confirmed that Watkins would return to Wales and to the place where his professional rugby career began, signing for Newport Gwent Dragons on a two-year contract. He was released at the end of the 2010-11 season and retired soon after.
On 20 May 2013, it was announced that Watkins had developed a very rare pelvic cancer while studying for rugby coaching qualifications, but described himself as remaining "well and active."

Only the Light

"Only the Light", written and composed by Richard Peebles, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1987, performed by Peebles himself, who was credited at Eurovision as Rikki.
Rikki won the right to perform at Brussels by winning the UK national final, "A Song for Europe", where he was the first singer to perform. At Brussels, the song was performed fourteenth on the night, after Luxembourg's Plastic Bertrand with "Amour Amour", and before France's Christine Minier with "Les mots d'amour n'ont pas de dimanche." At the end of judging that evening, "Only the Light" took the thirteenth-place slot with 47 points. It came as a huge disappointment to the United Kingdom as it was the lowest placement any of the country's entries had received up to that time.
Like the previous year, a rock song was in the offering, with an unclear theme (it is never explained what "the light" is, what kind of metaphor it is, why "the light" is after him or why he is avoiding it). On-stage that year were three backup singers and dancers, dressed in white, in addition to a keyboardist. Rikki, a native of Scotland, also accessorised with a tartan cloth slung over his shoulder.
The song placed at #96, not charting on the UK Singles Chart (the Top 75 songs) but as an addenda on the "Next 25" version of the charts. This was the second year of dismal sales for the UK's Eurovision entrant.

Police escort

A police escort, also known as a law enforcement escort, is a feature offered by most law enforcement agencies to assist in transporting VIPs or other important individuals. 
This is done by means of assigning police vehicles, primarily cars or motorcycles, to precede, surround, and/or follow a vehicle, or group of vehicles.
An escort can range widely in size, beginning with a single vehicle. They almost always assist with motorcades for the transportation of senior public officials, such as heads of state or heads of government, or can be hired by celebrities, professional athletes, or for funerals.
A police escort, contrary to popular belief, does not need to be side by side to those being escorted. The purpose of the police escort is to ensure those who are being escorted get to their destination in a safe manner.

In 1981 his parents decided to divorce. Together with his mother and his siblings he then moved to the Soestdijk Palace (Baarn), the then residence of the queen of the Netherlands. He lived at the palace for a number of years with his grandparents, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard, the Prince consort.
Education and career.
Prince Jaime studied International relations at the Brown University in the United States. After finishing this study he subsequently obtained a M.A. degree in International Economics and Conflict Management at the Johns Hopkins University. During this study he performed an internship at the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Red Cross.
He now works for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. His first roles were as the prime secretary of the Netherlands Embassy in Baghdad, before becoming a political advisor to the peace mission in Pol-e Khomri in the Baghlan Province in the northern part of Afghanistan. Until the summer of 2007 the prince worked on secondment in the cabinet of the European Commissioner Neelie Kroes. He is now back in The Hague at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he has the position of Special Envoy Natural Resources. On February 7 2014, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that he will be appointed as ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the Holy See. 
Other activities.
Prince Jaime has also worked as an interviewer for the documentary series "Africa, War is Business". In the documentary he investigated and explained how a country that is very rich in raw materials, can be dominated by poverty and conflict. In the series he visited Sierra Leone and its diamond fields, Liberia to see how an export embargo on its hardwood is carried out, before finishing the series in the DR Congo where he goes on a night patrol in the war torn East of the country, an area rich in gold and cobalt. In the documentary possible solutions are displayed from the perspective of the international community.
The prince regularly performs representative tasks for the royal house of the Netherlands and the Ducal House of Bourbon-Parma. He is regularly present as a representative at royal marriages, baptismal ceremonies, and funerals.
Personal life.
On 12 August 2013, Prince Jaime's engagement to Viktória Cservenyák was announced. Cservenyák (born 25 May 1982 in Budapest) is a Hungarian-born Dutch attorney and daughter of Dr. Tibor Cservenyák and his former wife, Dorottya Klára Bartos. On 3 October 2013, they married in a civil wedding ceremony in Wijk bij Duurstede, the Netherlands. Their religious wedding took place on 5 October 2013 at the Church of Our Lady in Apeldoorn. 
On 21 February 2014 at 12:40 at the Our Lady Hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Princess Viktória gave birth to their first child:
Titles.
Already a ducal prince from birth, his father bestowed the substantive title "Conte di Bardi" (Count of Bardi) upon him on 2 September 1996, as well as the Carlist title "Duque de San Jaime" (Duke of San Jaime) on 28 September 2003. In 1996 he was incorporated into the Dutch Nobility by Queen Beatrix, with the highest noble title "Prins de Bourbon de Parme" (Prince of Bourbon-Parma) and styled "Zijne Koninklijke Hoogheid" ("His Royal Highness"). He does not belong to the House of Orange-Nassau or the limited Dutch Royal House, but as a grandson of Queen Juliana and cousin of the present King Willem-Alexander, he is an official member of the more extended Dutch Royal Family.
Honours.
Grand Chancellor.
Prince Jaime is the Grand Chancellor of the Italian dynastic chivalric order "Ordine del Merito di San Lodovico" ("Order of the Saint Louis for Civil Merit"). The order was founded in 1836 by Charles II, Duke of Parma, his ancestor and who was the King of Etruria, Duke of Lucca, and Duke of Parma. The order consists of five degrees and is awarded to the members of the ducal house and praiseworthily citizens of Parma.

Massies Mill, Virginia

Massies Mill is an unincorporated community in Nelson County, Virginia, United States. It is located on State Route 56 adjacent to the headwaters of the Tye River. The head of the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway, a now-defunct short line railroad, was once located at Massies Mill. 
In August 1969, Massies Mill, then a village of forty homes, was at or very close to ground zero during one of the worst natural disasters to strike the Commonwealth of Virginia in the 20th century as the remnants of Hurricane Camille dumped an unprecedented amount of rain on unsuspecting residents as they slept, resulting in flash floods and mudslides which killed dozens of people throughout the county and surrounding areas.
History.
Virginia Blue Ridge Railroad.
In 1914, a company was incorporated to build a short line railroad which connected Massies Mill to the Southern Railway, a major trunk line, at Tye River Depot. The Virginia Blue Ridge Railway initially was built to haul chestnut for lumber out of the heavily-timbered Piney River area to local mills until World War I. The chestnut blight wiped out much of the timbered areas. However, the railroad later served several quarries in the area where titanium dioxide and aplite were mined. 
The VBR also passed through the communities of Roses Mill, Piney River, Canopy, Lowesville, and Buffalo Mine. It followed the course of the Tye and Piney Rivers for several miles before entering the mountains. 
The line was abandoned in 1980. Part of the roadbed is being developed as a rails-to-trails project, the Blue Ridge Railway Trail.
Tropical Storm Camille.
On the night of August 19, 1969, Massies Mill was one of the hardest hit communities when the remnants of Hurricane Camille arrived. The hurricane had come ashore on the Gulf Coast near the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 5 storm, one of only 3 to strike the US mainland during the 20th century. The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the U.S. state of Mississippi, and caused additional flooding and deaths inland. The storm had lost strength as it crossed hundreds of miles of land, and was downgraded by the National Weather Service to Tropical Storm status as it moved northwardly along the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountains and into Virginia. It still carried incredible amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture.
As it reached the area centered on Nelson County, a hilly, rural county with a population of around 15,000, the storm unexpectedly stalled on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Mostly within only a 3 hour period, it dumped a record quantity of of rain. The rainfall was so heavy there were reports of birds drowning in trees and of survivors who had to cup their hands around mouth and nose in order to breathe through such a deluge.
As many people slept unaware, the ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153 people, 22 in Massies Mill alone. Across Nelson County, 133 bridges were washed out, while some entire communities were under water. The major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communications between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley. Waynesboro on the South River saw eight feet of water downtown, and Buena Vista had more than five feet. Total damage in the state amounted to $140.8 million (1969 USD, $747 million 2005 USD).

Robert Wilkie

Robert Leon Wilkie is an American lawyer who served as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. An intelligence officer in the United States Naval Reserve, he was nominated for the position by U.S. President George W. Bush on June 20, 2006, and his appointment was approved by the Senate on September 30, 2006. He currently lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his wife and two children and now works at CH2M Hill.
Early life and education.
Wilkie was born in Frankfurt West Germany, and attended Fayetteville North Carolina's Reid Ross Senior High School. As the son of an Army Artillery officer, he grew up in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He received his bachelor's degree from the Wake Forest University in North Carolina. He went on to receive his law degree from Loyola University School of Law in New Orleans in 1988 and a Master of Laws in International and Comparative Law from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C..
Government career.
Prior to being named assistant secretary, Wilkie served as special assistant to the President for national security affairs and a senior director of the National Security Council where he was a senior policy advisor to then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice as well as her successor, Stephen Hadley. Mr. Wilkie developed strategic planning for the implementation of the Moscow Treaty, the Millennium Challenge Account, Iraqi Reconstruction and NATO Expansion. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates awarded him the Defense Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian award of the Department. 
He began his professional career on Capitol Hill as Counsel to Jesse Helms, and later served as legislative director for Rep. David Funderburk of North Carolina. He was assigned to the Committee on International Relations and the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. In 1997, he began service as counsel and advisor on international security affairs to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
Controversy.
Wilkie gained attention for outlining guidelines that restricted congressional testimony to high-ranking officers and civilians appointed by President Bush. Several congressional officials accused Wilkie of preventing military's lower ranks to testify, which were more likely to give Congress an honest opinion opposed to higher ranks that sided with the administration.
According to a Boston Globe article, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress saw this as a "blatant attempt to bog down investigations of the war". In addition, there was an argument that the Pentagon had no authority to set those rules. The controversy involved one subcommittee and Wilkie argued on behalf of the Pentagon that the enlisted soldiers who were the target of the subcomittee's investigation had to be given the opportunity to avail themselves of counsel. Once there was a change in the subcommittee's leadership, the Pentagon reached an accommodation which gave the subcommittee access to the soldiers.

Midway Mills, Virginia

Midway Mills is an unincorporated community in Nelson County, Virginia, United States.
Midway, now called Midway Mills, was the first settlement established in Nelson County, Virginia, on June 6, 1774, by Dr. William Cabell, (born 1699). It was named Midway because it was midway between Richmond and Lynchburg along the James River. This area was known first as "Warminster" (named after the home of Dr. Cabell in Wiltshire, England), then as "Swan Creek Estates" and afterwards as "Liberty Hall Plantation" with the area now being known as "Wingina". The area, at that time part of "Old Albemarle County", was later divided into the counties of Albemarle, Amherst, Buckingham, Nelson, and Fluvanna between 1741 and 1809.
Dr. William Cabell owned many slaves, which were inherited by his children and grandchildren. One great-grandchild, Nathaniel Francis Cabell, (born 1807) documented a list of slaves in a diary, which is kept at the Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. His list of slave families living at Edgewood, Warminster, Union Hill, and Liberty Hall includes the Nicholas, Diggs, Venable, Woodson, Mayo, Early, Tompkins, Beverly, Horsley, Tucker, Rose, and Rives families.
It was the site of Midway Mill, constructed in 1787, by William H. Cabell and demolished in 1998.

Cuca, Argeș

Cuca is a commune in Argeş County, in southern central Romania. It is composed of fourteen villages: Bălţata, Bărbălani, Cârceşti, Cotu, Crivăţu, Cuca, Lăunele de Sus, Măcăi, Măneşti, Sineşti, Stănicei, Teodoreşti, Valea Cucii and Vonigeasa. It was one of the most remote places in Romania. Today, in Romanian language, "Cuca Măcăii" means "a remote village or place, very difficult to reach".
History.
The oldest document about Cuca is from April 3, 1853, referring to an even older document, from 1537. The commune was formed in 1968 at its current shape by merging the former communes Cuca and Lăunele. Another former commune was Măcăi.
Geography.
Cuca is placed in the "Getic Platform", subdivision "Cotmeana Platform". The relief is segmented by many parallel valleys, while the villages are on the top of the hills, separated by forest areals.The rivers flow from North to South, South-East or South-West. The vallies dry up in summer. The altitude varies from .
The climate is temperate, with moderate summers and cold winters. The humidity is usually big.
Villages.
The commune includes 14 small villages (the largest number in Argeş County).
Transportation.
There are two national roads close to Cuca:
From these roads, the access way to Cuca is via loca county roads:
The distances to the nearest towns are:
Economy.
Resources.
Cuca has two major resources: forests and fruit trees. The forests cover a big part of the commune and all the villages have direct access to the wooden areas. Nearly all the remaining terrain is used for fruit trees (mainly plum trees). The fruits are used to make "ţuică", a Romanian alcoholic drink.
Firms.
There are 21 firms in the commune, including a pharmaceutical point and small local shops. There are no industrial or agricultural companies. The big distances to nearby cities (see #transportation) and the lack of bus lines makes it very difficult for the local population to find a good job.
Problems.
The main problem for the economy is isolation (see #Transportation). The second problem is the lack of water. Some people say that in Cuca, water is as precious as in Sahara Desert. The villages are on the top of the hills and the rivers are about 100 m below the villages and they dry up in summer (see #Geography). The freatic waters are even deeper, so permanent freatic water exixts more than 100 m below the river valleys. Pumping water from such depth is nearly impossible. A water pipeline was constructed to bring water to the villages in Cuca. For this, the pipe had to be longer than 100 km. It drains water from Topolog River and continues South to other communes with similar water problems.
The legend of "Cuca Măcăii".
In Romanian language, "Cuca Măcăii" defines a remote village or place, very difficult to reach. It is still unknown how this expression appeared. However, the Măcăi village is called by the locals "Cuca Măcăii". Many people associate the commune Cuca with "Cuca Măcăii". The entire commune is formed by small villages, isolated in forest (see#Villages). In past, transportation was very difficult. In 1922, the national road DN 67b did not exist. Older maps show that even the road that connects Piteşti and Râmnicu Vâlcea did not exist. Being isolated by sharp valleys and long, parallel hills (see #Geography), the land where Cuca is today must have been a very isolated place.

Second Stadtholderless Period

The Second Stadtholderless Period or Era () is the designation in Dutch historiography of the period between the death of stadtholder William III on March 19, 1702 and the appointment of William IV as stadtholder and captain general in all provinces of the Dutch Republic on May 2, 1747. During this period the office of stadtholder was left vacant in the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht, though in other provinces that office was filled by members of the House of Nassau-Dietz (later called Orange-Nassau) during various periods. During the period the Republic lost its Great-Power status and its primacy in world trade, processes that went hand-in-hand, the latter causing the former. Though the economy declined considerably, causing deindustralization and deurbanization in the maritime provinces, a "rentier"-class kept accumulating a large capital fund that formed the basis for the leading position the Republic achieved in the international capital market. A military crisis at the end of the period caused the fall of the States-Party regime and the restoration of the Stadtholderate in all provinces. However, though the new stadtholder acquired near-dictatorial powers, this did not improve the situation.
Background.
Historiographical note.
The terms First Stadtholderless Period and Second Stadtholderless Period became established as terms of art in Dutch historiography during the 19th century, the heyday of nationalistic history writing, when Dutch historians wistfully looked back on the glory days of the Dutch Revolt and the Dutch Golden Age and were looking for scapegoats for "what went wrong" in later years. Partisans of the new royal house of Orange-Nassau, like Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, who were indeed continuing the traditions of the Orangist party during the Republic, recast that history as a heroic narrative of the exploits of the stadtholders of the House of Orange (interestingly, the Frisian stadtholders from the House of Nassau-Dietz, though the forebears of the House of Orange-Nassau, were less prominently featured). Anybody who had stood in the way of those stadtholders, like the representatives of the States Party, eminently fitted the role of "bad guys" in these romantic stories. Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, Hugo Grotius, Johan de Witt, though not actually demonized, got decidedly shorter shrift than later historians were prepared to do. The lesser-known regents of later years even fared worse. John Lothrop Motley, who introduced Americans to the history of the Dutch Republic in the 19th century, was strongly influenced by this point of view.
The general gist of the narrative was that as long as the stadtholders led the country, all was well, whereas when such heroic figures were replaced with the humdrum regents, the ship of state inexorably drifted to the cliffs of history. Superficially, the Orangist historians seemed to have a point, because both stadtholderless periods arguably ended in disaster. The negative connotation of the term therefore seemed well deserved. However, other historians put question marks next to the causal process that the Orangists postulated.
However this may be, one could ask whether an emotionally and politically loaded term like this is still appropriate as a historical label in the task of historical periodization? Apart from the fact that long-persisting use in common parlance has established such a right to exist, that question may be answered in the affirmative, because as it turns out, the "absence" of a stadtholder was indeed a (positively perceived) principle of the constitution of the Republic in these historical periods. It was the cornerstone of De Witt's "True Freedom", the ideological underpinning of his States-Party regime during the first period, and would be revived as such during the second period. The renowned 19th-century Dutch historian Robert Fruin (who cannot be accused of overly Orangist sympathies) uses the arguably more appropriate term "stadtholderless "regime"" for the periods, to emphasize the fact that we are not just concerned with a label, but that there was something in the historical situation that gives the historical circumscription "stadtholderless period" meaning.
The stadtholderate of William III.
The popular revolt in reaction to the French invasion of 1672, during the Franco-Dutch war, had overturned the States-Party regime of Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt (ending the First Stadtholderless Period) and swept William III of Orange into power. He was appointed stadtholder in Holland and Zeeland in July, 1672, and received powers that went far beyond those of his predecessors. His position was made impregnable when the States-General of the Netherlands authorized him in September, 1672 to purge the city governments of major Holland cities from regents of the States Party, and replace them with adherents of the Orangist faction. His political position was further consolidated when the office of stadtholder was made hereditary for his putative descendants in the male line in Holland and Zeeland in 1674 (The office was made hereditary for the descendants of the House of Nassau-Dietz in Friesland and Groningen in 1675, apparently in an attempt to check dynastic encroachments from Holland on Frisian sovereignty).
At the readmission of the provinces, that had been occupied by the French in 1672, to the Union after 1674 (they had been barred from the States General during their occupation), those provinces (Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel) had to pay a political price in the form of the so-called "Regeringsreglementen" (Government regulations) that William imposed on them. These may be compared to organic laws that gave him the right to appoint most officials on the provincial level in these provinces and to control the election of city magistrates and magistrates ("baljuws") in the countryside.
Many have erroneously interpreted these developments as the office of the stadtholder (at least in Holland and Zeeland) becoming "monarchical." That would be a misunderstanding, however, even though the court of the stadtholder took on a decidedly "princely" aspect (as it had done under William's grandfather Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange). If William was a monarch at all, it was a "constitutional" one, with still sharply limited powers, formally and politically. The States-General remained sovereign in the Republic, the entity with which other states concluded treaties and made war or peace. The pretensions to sovereign supremacy of the provinces, however, as under the De Witt regime, were again replaced with the constitutional theory of Maurice, Prince of Orange, after his overturning of the regime of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt in 1618, in which the provinces were at least in certain respects subservient to the "Generality."
The new, extended prerogatives of the stadtholder mostly regarded his powers of patronage and these enabled him to build a strong powerbase. But his power was in large manner checked by other centers of power, especially the States of Holland and the city of Amsterdam within that province. Especially that city was able to obstruct William's policies if they were perceived to conflict with its interest. But if they coincided William was able to forge a coalition that could override any opposition. This was demonstrated for instance in the summer months of 1688 when Amsterdam was persuaded to support the invasion of England, which later led to the Glorious Revolution and William and Mary's accession to the British thrones.
Nevertheless, these developments were a result of William's (and his friends, like Grand Pensionary Gaspar Fagel and William Bentinck) persuasive powers and skill in coalition building, not from his exercise of "monarchical powers." Though commander-in-chief of the Republic, William could not simply order the invasion, but needed the authorization of the States-General and the States of Holland (who in practice held the strings of the public purse). On the other hand, the events of the 1690s helped to bring about a Grand Consensus in the Dutch Republic around the foreign policy, centered on opposing the designs of Louis XIV of France and maintaining (to that end) a close alliance with the former arch-enemy England, also when it became clear toward the end of William's life, that that country would after his death be governed by someone who would not necessarily put the interests of the Republic first (as William arguably did).
This grand consensus, however, was not the product of slavish sycophancy of courtiers, but of a genuine intellectual agreement in Dutch government circles that this was the right policy to follow, at least in the foreign policy field. It did not necessarily extend to the domestic policy field in all respects, and this may explain the course of events after William's sudden death in early 1702.
The complicated succession of William III in his regnal titles and possessions.
When he died, William was King of England, Scotland and Ireland, but the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 firmly placed the succession in these kingdoms in the hands of his sister-in-law and cousin Anne. The succession to his other titles and offices was not that clear, however. As William died without (legitimate) issue, he had to make provisions in his last will and testament to prevent any uncertainty. Indeed, he made John William Friso, Prince of Orange, head of the cadet branch of Nassau-Dietz of the family, his general heir, both privately and politically.
There was doubt, however, if he had the authority to dispose of the complex of titles and lands, connected with the title Prince of Orange, as he saw fit. As he undoubtedly knew, his grandfather Frederick Henry had made a "fideicommis" (Fee tail) in his will that established cognatic succession in his own line as the general succession rule in the House of Orange. This provision gave the succession to the male offspring of his eldest daughter Luise Henriette of Nassau in case his own male line would become extinct. (At the time Frederick Henry died his only son William II, Prince of Orange did not yet have a legitimate heir, so the entailment made sense at the time, if he wanted to prevent the inheritance from falling into the hands of distant relatives). Such an entailment was quite common in aristocratic circles, to ensure the integrity of the inheritance. The problem was, that an entailment in general view limits the power of the possessors of the entailed inheritance to dispose of it as they see fit. William probably intended to override this provision, but the entailment made his will vulnerable to dispute.
And disputed it was, on the ground that it clashed with Frederick Henry's entailment, by the beneficiary of that entailment, Luise Henriette's son Frederick I of Prussia. But Frederick was not the only person who contested William's Will. Frederick Henry's entailment happened to be the last in a long line of entailments by previous holders of the title Prince of Orange, beginning with René of Châlon, who had founded the dynasty by willing the title to his nephew William the Silent, the progenitor of most of the claimants. René had made an entailment that gave the succession to the female line of his nephew, in case the male line would become extinct. This overruled the agnatic succession apparently prevailing before this time for the title. It would be interesting to know who would inherit according to this rule, but apparently there was no claimant, basing himself on it. (The two eldest daughters of William the Silent, one of which was married to William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, the brother of John William Friso's ancestor, died without issue).
However, Philip William, Prince of Orange William the Silent's eldest son, made an entailment that would override René's entailment, restoring the agnatic succession, and giving it to the male line of John VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, William the Silent's brother. As it happened, the beneficiary of this provision was one William Hyacinth of Nassau-Siegen, who also vigorously contested the will in 1702. To complete the confusion, Maurice, Prince of Orange, Philip William's half-brother made an entailment that would give the succession to the male line of Ernst Casimir of Nassau-Dietz, a younger son of John VI, and the progenitor of John William Friso. This was (next to William's Will) the main claim to the inheritance of John William Friso. (Interestingly, Frederick Henry's entailment overturned this entailment of his half-brother, if such a thing would have been possible; apparently he did not fancy the succession by Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz, who would otherwise have benefited).
All these claims and counter-claims set the stage for vigorous litigation, especially between Frederick of Prussia and Henriëtte Amalia van Anhalt-Dessau, the mother of John Wiliam Friso, as the latter was still a minor in 1702. This litigation was to go on for thirty years between the offspring of the two main claimants, until the matter was finally settled out of court with the Treaty of Partition between William IV, Prince of Orange, John William Friso's son, and Frederick William I of Prussia, Frederick's son, in 1732. The latter had in the meantime ceded the principality of Orange to Louis XIV of France by one of the treaties, comprising the Peace of Utrecht (in exchange for Prussian territorial gains in Upper-Guelders), thereby making the matter of succession to the title rather immaterial (the two claimants decided to henceforth both use the title). The remaining inheritance was shared between the two rivals.
The import of this story is, that young John William Friso's claim to the title of Prince of Orange was contested during the crucial years immediately following William III's death, thereby depriving him of an important source of prestige and power. He already was stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, as this office had been made hereditary in 1675 and he had succeeded his father Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz in 1696, be it under the regency of his mother, as he was only nine at the time. He now hoped to inherit the office in Holland and Zeeland also, especially as William III had groomed him for the office, and had made him his political heir, and the office was hereditary. However, that provision had been contingent on a natural male heir for William III. The Holland regents did not feel bound by a testamentary provision.
Nine days after William's death the Grand Pensionary of Holland, Anthonie Heinsius, appeared before the States General and declared that the States of Holland had decided not to fill the vacancy of stadtholder in their province. The old patents from December, 1650, conveying the prerogatives of the stadtholder in matters of election of magistrates to the city governments were once more put in force. Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, Overijssel, and even Drenthe (which usually followed Groningen in the matter of stadtholders, but had appointed William III in 1696) followed suit. The "Regeringsreglementen" of 1675 were retracted and the situation pre-1672 restored.
The immediate effect was that regents from the old States-Party faction were restored to their old positions (i.e. in most cases members of their families, as the old regents had died) at the expense of Orangist regents who had been appointed by William. This purge occurred generally peacefully in Holland, but in Zeeland, and especially Gelderland, there was sometimes long-drawnout civil unrest, which sometimes had to be suppressed by calling out the militia, or even federal troops. In Gelderland there was even a genuine "democratic" impulse behind this unrest as the would-be newcomers (the "nieuwe plooi" or "new crew") availed themselves of the support of the common people who demanded a check by the pre-Habsburg councils of "gemeenslieden", and generally of the representatives of militias and guilds, on the regent city governments, a development deplored by States-Party and Orangist regents alike.
Any inclination Holland and the other four provinces might have had to appoint Friso as stadtholder probably was negated by the fraught international situation. A new conflict with the France of Louis XIV was about to break out (William III indeed had spent the last days of his life finalizing the preparations) and this was no time to experiment with a fifteen-year-old boy in such important offices as that of stadtholder and captain-general of the Dutch States Army. Besides, the States-General did not want to offend an important ally like Frederick I of Prussia, who had already in March, 1702, occupied the counties of Lingen and Moers (which belonged to William's patrimony) and was not too subtly threatening to defect to the French side in the coming war if he were thwarted in his quest for his "rightful" inheritance.
Heinsius and the War of Spanish Succession.
Anthonie Heinsius had been Grand Pensionary since 1689, almost as long as William III had been king of England. As William was busy managing his new subjects (he realized that conquering England was much easier than keeping it conquered; the word "conquest" was therefore taboo, and has remained so ever since) the equally difficult task of managing the Dutch politicians back home was left to the capable hands of Heinsius, who shared much of William's genius for politics, and many of his diplomatic gifts. Those diplomatic gifts were also needed in keeping the grand coalition together that William had been able to form against Louis XIV during the Nine Years' War. It needed to be resurrected after the last will and testament of king Charles II of Spain, leaving the Spanish Crown to Louis' grandson Philip after Carlos' childless death in 1700, threatened to upend the European balance of power (so laboriously brought about with the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697) and diplomatic efforts to save that balance had failed.
William spent his last year of life feverishly rebuilding the coalition with Austria, his nephew Frederick I of Prussia, and a host of smaller German princes to support the claim to the Spanish throne of Charles III, as a means of preventing a union of the power of Spain and France, which might overwhelm the rest of Europe. He was ably assisted in this effort by Heinsius (as the Republic was the keystone of the Coalition and would be called upon to provide not only a large contingent of the allied troops, but also considerable subsidies to the other allies to pay for their contingents) and his English favorite, the Duke of Marlborough. These preparatory negotiations had all but been completed when William died on March 19, 1702 from complications after a fall off his horse.
William's unexpected death threw the preparations into disarray. Would the quiet revolution, overturning the stadtholderate and reintroducing the States-Party regime in the Republic, cause a rupture with England and the other allies? It seems there was never any danger of this, if only because the Republic (still a Great Power at this time, after all) was not about to break with the policies of the dead stadtholder in the foreign field, whatever they may have thought of his domestic policies.
Moreover, the Dutch regents had their own reasons to join the Coalition. In 1701 French troops had entered the Southern Netherlands with the consent of the Spanish authorities, and had forced the Dutch to evacuate their barrier fortresses, that they had acquired as recently as the Peace of Ryswick just to "prevent" such a French incursion. This eliminated the buffer zone the Dutch preferred between themselves and the French. More importantly, the French opened the Scheldt to trade with Antwerp in contravention of the peace treaty with Spain of 1648 (which Spain had always scrupulously observed).
Also, Dutch trade with Spain and the Spanish Colonies seemed to be in danger of being diverted to French merchants in view of France's mercantilist policies. In 1701 the new Bourbon king Philip V transferred the Asiento for instance to a French company, whereas before the Dutch West India Company had in practice held this trade concession. In short, the Dutch had many economic reasons, beside the obvious strategic ones, to oppose Louis' taking over Spain and its possessions.
However, William's death did pose the problem that his position as undisputed military leader in the field (as during the Nine Years' War) was now vacant. At first it was proposed that Queen Anne's prince-consort Prince George of Denmark would become "generalissimo" of the combined Dutch and English armies, but (though they feigned enthusiasm) the Dutch preferred a competent general and managed to push Marlborough forward without hurting Anne and George's feelings too much. Appointing Marlborough "lieutenant"-captain-general of the Dutch army (leaving the top job formally vacant) was preferred by the States-Party regents, who trusted a foreign general (presumably without political ambitions) in this position more than a domestic general. During the first stadtholderless period in the 1650s they had played with the idea of appointing the French Marshal Turenne, though nothing came of it. In other words, Marlborough's appointment solved a political problem for them too. Besides, in a secret arrangement, Marlborough was put under the tutelage of Dutch deputies-in-the-field (a kind of political commissars) with veto powers over his decisions. This would prove to be a source of constant friction in the campaigns to come, as these politicians tended to emphasize the risks to the Dutch troops of Marlborough's decisions over their evident strategic brilliance.
This Dutch interest (and Marlborough's acquiescence in this tutelage) can be explained by the preponderant role of Dutch troop contingents in the allied order of battle. The Dutch supplied about twice as many troops as the English in the Flanders theatre of war (more than 100,000 against 40,000 in 1708), a fact that somehow often has been overlooked in English historiography, and they also played an important part in the Iberian theatre. For instance, Gibraltar was conquered by a combined Anglo-Dutch naval and marine force and after that held in the name of Charles III by a joint force, until Britain acquired this strategic position for itself in 1713.
Despite frictions with Dutch deputies and generals (who not always showed the required awe of Marlboroughs abilities) Anglo-Dutch cooperation in the military and diplomatic field was usually excellent, thanks to the rapport between Heinsius and Marlborough. The former supported Marlborough during the clash with General Slangenburg after the Battle of Ekeren and facilitated Slangenburgh's removal, despite his heroic status in Dutch public opinion. Cooperation with other Dutch generals like Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk at the battles of Elixheim, Ramillies, and Oudenaarde, and later with John William Friso at Malplaquet was much improved, as was the relationship with the Dutch deputies-in-the-field, especially Sicco van Goslinga.
Marlborough's and Prince Eugene of Savoy's successes in the field resulted in the Southern Netherlands being mostly cleared of French forces in the course of 1708. A joint Anglo-Dutch military occupation of this country was now established in which the Dutch economic interest predominated. The Dutch sought partial compensation in this for the English economic predominance that the allied operations in the Iberian Peninsula had brought about in Portugal and Spain. Like Portugal for Britain, the Southern Netherlands were now transformed into a captive market for the Dutch, by restoring the favorable Spanish tariff list of 1680 to replace the recent French mercantilist measures.
The Dutch also hoped to limit the prospective Habsburg control of the Southern Netherlands and to transform it into an Austro-Dutch codominion by a new, improved form of the Barrier provisions of the Treaty of Ryswick. Heinsius now offered Great Britain (as it had become through the Acts of Union 1707) a guarantee of the Protestant Succession in exchange for British support for a Dutch right to garrison whichever, and as many towns and fortresses in the Austrian Netherlands, as the States General wished for. This exchange of guarantees (which both countries would come to regret) led to the Barrier Treaty of 1709. Under it, the Dutch had to sent 6,000 troops to England to keep order at both the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings.
By 1710 the war had, despite these Allied successes, turned into a stalemate. Both the French and Dutch were exhausted and yearning for peace. Louis now embarked on an attempt to divide the Allies by dangling the prospect of a favorable separate peace before the noses of the Dutch. During the not-so-secret Geertruidenberg negotiations of the Spring of 1710 Louis offered to accept the removal of his grandson Philip from the Spanish throne in favor of Charles III, in exchange for the Habsburg territories in Italy as compensation for Philip. He tempted the Dutch with their craved-for Barrier in the Austrian Netherlands and a return to the favorable French tariff list of 1664 and other economic concessions.
The Dutch government was severely tempted, but declined for a complex of reasons. Not only would such a separate peace be dishonorable in their view, but it would also earn them the enduring enmity of the British and Austrians. They remembered how difficult it had been to restore friendship with their allies after they had fallen for Louis enticements at the peace of Nijmegen in 1678 and left their friends in the lurch. They also remembered how often Louis had broken his word previously. The deal-breaker was that they expected Louis to turn on the Dutch after he had dealt with his other opponents. They would be friendless if that happened. Finally, despite Louis' offer to acquiesce in Philip's removal, he refused to actively participate in such a removal. The allies would have to do it themselves. Heinsius and his colleagues saw no alternative to continuing the war.
The Peace of Utrecht and the Second Great Assembly.
Louis eventually tired of his fruitless attempts to pry the Dutch loose from the Grand Alliance, and turned his attentions to Great Britain. It had not escaped his attention that great political changes had taken place there. Though Queen Anne was less partial than William III to the Whigs, she had soon discovered that she could as yet not govern with sole support of the Tories and had since the early experiments with a Tory government had a moderate Tory government with Whig support under Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin and the Whig-leaning Marlborough. However, Marlborough's wife Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, who had been Queen Anne's favorite for a long time, thereby giving her husband an informal powerbase, had had a falling-out with the Queen over Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham, Sarah's poor relative, who had replaced her in the Queen's favor. After that, Sarah's star declined and with it her husband's. Instead the star of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (Abigail's cousin) went into the ascendant, especially after the Tories won the parliamentary elections in 1710.
Harley formed a new government with Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke as Secretary of State and this new government entered into secret negotiations with Louis XIV to conclude a separate peace between Great Britain and France. These negotiations soon achieved success as Louis was prepared to make great concessions (he basically offered the same concessions he had offered to the Dutch, and some more, like the port of Dunkirk as surety for his good intentions) and the new British government did not feel constrained to respect the interests of its Allies in any sense.
If this breach of trust with the Allies was not bad enough, the British government started to actively sabotage the Allied war effort while the war was still progressing full tilt. In May, 1712 Bolingbroke ordered the Duke of Ormonde who had succeeded Marlborough as captain-general of the British forces (though not of the Dutch forces, as the Dutch government had transferred command to Prince Eugene) to refrain from taking further part in the hostilities. Bolingbroke informed the French of this instruction, but not the Allies. However, it became evident during the siege of Quesnoy when the French commander, Villars who noticed British forces under the besieging forces, understandably demanded a clarification of Ormonde. The British general then withdrew his forces from the Allied camp and marched away with just the British soldiers (the mercenaries in British pay refused to take part in the blatant defection). Ironically, the French felt also hard done by, because they had expected "all" forces in British pay to disappear, thereby fatally weakening the forces of Prince Eugene. This had been an essential element of the Franco-British agreement. Would France still feel constrained to give up Dunkirk under these circumstances, as promised.
Winston Churchill describes the feelings of the British soldiers thus:
The rest of the Allies felt likewise, especially after the Battle of Denain which Prince Eugene lost as a consequence of the weakening of the Allied force, due to the withdrawal of the British troops, with great loss of life to the Dutch and Austrian troops. Bolingbroke congratulated the victor Villars with his victory, adding insult to injury. When it transpired during the formal peace negotiations at Utrecht that the British and French had already struck a secret deal disillusionment and despair swept the Dutch and Austrians. In the Hague there were anti-British riots and there was even talk of a Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, sixty-eight years before such a war actually would break out. Austria and the Republic briefly tried to continue the war on their own, but the Dutch and Prussians soon came to the conclusion that it was a hopeless quest. Only the Austrians fought on.
Consequently, on April 11, 1713 the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) was signed by France and most of the Allies. France made most of the concessions, but not as many as would have been the case if the Harley-Bolingbroke government had not betrayed its allies. Great Britain came off best, with territorial concessions in Spain (Gibraltar and Minorca), and North America, while the lucrative Asiento now went to a British consortium, which was set to profit from almost a century of slave trading. The big loser was Charles III who did not get the Spanish Crown about which the whole war had started. However, Charles had become Holy Roman Emperor himself in the meantime, which decidedly dampened the enthusiasm of the Allies to support his claims. Doing so would have tilted the balance of power in Europe in a pro-Habsburg way. However, as compensation Austria received the former Spanish Netherlands, more or less intact, besides the former Spanish possessions in Italy (except Sicily which went to Savoy but was later exchanged with Austria for Sardinia).
Though much has been made of the fact that the Republic decidedly came off second best (the taunt by the French negotiator, Melchior de Polignac, ""De vous, chez vous, sans vous"", meaning that the Peace Congress had decided over the Dutch interests in their own country, but without them, still rankles), they actually attained most of their war aims: the desired codominion over the Austrian Netherlands, and the Barrier of fortresses in that country, were attained under the Austro-Dutch Treaty of November, 1715 (France already having acquiesced at Utrecht), though the Dutch, due to British obstruction, did not gain all they had hoped for.
The Treaty of Ryswick was reconfirmed (as a matter of fact, the Franco-Dutch part of the Treaty of Utrecht is almost synonymous with that treaty; only the preambles differ) and this implied important economic concessions by the French, particularly the return to the French tariff list of 1664. Important in the economic field was also that the closing of the Scheldt to trade with Antwerp was once again confirmed.
Still, disillusionment in government circles of the Republic was great. Heinsius policy of alliance with Great Britain was in ruins, which he personally took very hard. It has been said that he was a broken man afterwards and never regained his prestige and influence, even though he remained in office as Grand Pensionary until his death in 1720. Relations with Great Britain were very strained as long as the Harley-Bolingbroke ministry remained in office. This was only for a short time, however, as they fell in disfavor after the death of Queen Anne and the accession to the British throne of the Elector of Hanover, George I of Great Britain in August, 1714. Both were impeached and Bolingbroke would spent the remainder of his life in exile in France. The new king greatly preferred the Whigs and in the new Ministry Marlborough returned to power. The Republic and Great Britain now entered on a long-lasting period of amity, which would last as long as the Whigs were in power.
The policy of working in tandem between the Republic and Great Britain was definitively a thing of the past, however. The Dutch had lost their trust in the British. The Republic now embarked on a policy of Neutralism, which would last until the end of the stadtholderless period. To put it differently: the Republic resigned voluntarily as a Great Power. As soon as the peace was signed the States General started disbanding the Dutch army. Troop strength was reduced from 130,000 in 1713 to 40,000 (about the pre-1672 strength) in 1715. The reductions in the navy were comparable. This was a decisive change, because other European powers kept their armies and navies up to strength.
The main reason for this voluntary resignation, so to speak, was the dire situation of the finances of the Republic. The Dutch had financed the wars of William III primarily with borrowing. Consequently, the public debt had risen from 38 million guilders after the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 to the staggering sum of 128 million guilders in 1713. In itself this need not be debilitating, but the debt-service of this tremendous debt consumed almost all of the normal tax revenue. Something evidently had to give. The tax burden was already appreciable and the government felt that could not be increased. The only feasible alternative seemed to be reductions in expenditures, and as most government expenditures were in the military sphere, that is where they had to be made.
However, there was another possibility, at least in theory, to get out from under the debt burden and retain the Republic's military stature: fiscal reform. The quota system which determined the contributions of the seven provinces to the communal budget had not been revised since 1616 and had arguably grown skewed. But this was just one symptom of the debilitating particularism of the government of the Republic. The secretary of the "Raad van State" (Council of State) Simon van Slingelandt privately enumerated a number of necessary constitutional reforms in his "Political Discourses"(which would only be published posthumously in 1785) and he set to work in an effort to implement them.
On the initiative of the States of Overijssel the States-General were convened in a number of extraordinary sessions, collectively known as the "Tweede Grote Vergadering" (Second Great Assembly, a kind of Constitutional Convention) of the years 1716-7 to discuss his proposals. The term was chosen as a reminder of the Great Assembly of 1651 which inaugurated the first stadtholderless period. But that first Great Assembly had been a special congress of the provincial States, whereas in this case only the States General were involved. Nevertheless, the term is appropriate, because no less than a revision of the Union of Utrecht-treaty was intended.
As secretary of the "Raad van State" (a federal institution) Van Slingelandt was able to take a federal perspective, as opposed to a purely provincial perspective, as most other politicians (even the Grand Pensionary) were wont to do. One of the criticisms Van Slingelandt made, was that unlike in the early years of the Republic (which he held up as a positive example) majority-voting was far less common, leading to debilitating deadlock in the decisionmaking. As a matter of fact, one of the arguments of the defenders of the stadtholderate was that article 7 of the Union of Utrecht had charged the stadtholders of the several provinces (there was still supposed to be more than one at that time) with breaking such deadlocks in the States-General through arbitration. Van Slingelandt, however (not surprisingly in view of his position in the "Raad van State"), proposed a different solution to the problem of particularism: he wished to revert to a stronger position of the "Raad" as an executive organ for the Republic, as had arguably existed before the inclusion of two English members in that council under the governorate-general of the Earl of Leicester in 1586 (which membership lasted until 1625) necessitated the emasculation of that council by Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. A strong executive (but not an "eminent head", the alternative the Orangists always preferred) would in his view bring about the other reforms necessary to reform the public finances, that in turn would bring about the restoration of the Republic as a leading military and diplomatic power. (And this in turn would enable the Republic to reverse the trend among its neighbors to put protectionist measures in the path of Dutch trade and industry, which already were beginning to cause the steep decline of the Dutch economy in these years. The Republic had previously been able to counter such measures by diplomatic, even military, means.) Unfortunately, vested interests were too strong, and despite much debate the Great Assembly came to nothing.
The Van Hoornbeek and Van Slingelandt terms in office.
Apparently, Van Slingelandt's efforts at reform not only failed, but he had made so many enemies trying to implement them, that his career was interrupted. When Heinsius died in August, 1720 Van Slingelandt was pointedly passed over for the office of Grand Pensionary and it was given to Isaac van Hoornbeek. Van Hoornbeek had been pensionary of the city of Rotterdam and as such he represented that city in the States-General. During Heinsius' term in office he often assisted the Grand Pensionary in a diplomatic capacity and in managing the political troubles between the provinces. He was, however, more a civil servant, than a politician by temperament. This militated against his taking a role as a forceful political leader, as other Grand Pensionaries, like Johan de Witt, and to a lesser extent, Gaspar Fagel and Heinsius had been.
This is probably just the way his backers liked it. Neutralist sentiment was still strong in the years following the Barrier Treaty with Austria of 1715. The Republic felt safe from French incursions behind the string of fortresses in the Austrian Netherlands it was now allowed to garrison. Besides, under the Regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans after the death of Louis XIV, France hardly formed a menace. Though the States-General viewed the acquisitive policies of Frederick William I of Prussia on the eastern frontier of the Republic with some trepidation this as yet did not form a reason to seek safety in defensive alliances. Nevertheless, other European powers did not necessarily accept such an aloof posture (used as they were to the hyperactivity in the first decade of the century), and the Republic was pressured to become part of the Quadruple Alliance and take part in its war against Spain after 1718. However, though the Republic formally acceded to the Alliance, obstruction of the city of Amsterdam, which feared for its trade interests in Spain and its colonies, prevented an active part of the Dutch military (though the Republic's diplomats hosted the peace negotiations that ended the war).
On the internal political front all had been quiet since the premature death of John William Friso in 1711. He had a posthumous son, William IV, Prince of Orange, who was born about six weeks after his death. That infant was no serious candidate for any official post in the Republic, though the Frisian States faithfully promised to appoint him to their stadtholdership, once he would come of age. In the meantime his mother Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel (like her mother-in-law before her) acted as regent for him in Friesland, and pursued the litigation over the inheritance of William III with Frederick William of Prussia.
But Orangism as a political force remained dormant until in 1718 the States of Friesland formally designated him their future stadtholder, followed the next year by the States of Groningen. In 1722 the States of Drenthe followed suit, but what made the other provinces suspicious was that the same year Orangists in the States of Gelderland started agitating to make him prospective stadtholder there too. This was a new development, as stadtholders of the House of Nassau-Dietz previously had only served in the three northern provinces mentioned just now. Holland, Zeeland and Overijssel therefore tried to intervene, but the Gelderland Orangists prevailed, though the States of Gelderland at the same time drew up an "Instructie" (commission) that almost reduced his powers to nothing, certainly compared to the authority William III had possessed under the Government Regulations of 1675. Nevertheless, this decision of Gelderland caused a backlash in the other stadtholderless provinces that reaffirmed their firm rejection of a new stadtholderate in 1723.
When Van Hoornbeek died in office in 1727 Van Slingelandt finally got his chance as Grand Pensionary, though his suspected Orangist leanings caused his principals to demand a verbal promise that he would maintain the stadtholderless regime. He also had to promise that he would not try again to bring about constitutional reforms.
William IV came of age in 1729 and was duly appointed stadtholder in Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe and Gelderland. Holland barred him immediately from the "Raad van State" (and also of the captaincy-general of the Union) on the pretext that his appointment would give the northern provinces an undue advantage. In 1732 he concluded the Treaty of Partition over the contested inheritance of the Prince of Orange with his rival Frederick William. By the terms of the treaty, William and Frederick William agreed to recognize each other as Princes of Orange. William also got the right to refer to his House as Orange-Nassau. As a result of the treaty, William's political position improved appreciably. It now looked as if the mighty Prussian king would start supporting him in the politics of the Republic.
One consequence of the settlement was that the Prussian king removed his objections to the assumption by William IV of the dignity of First Noble in the States of Zeeland, on the basis of his ownership of the Marquisates of Veere and Vlissingen. To block such a move the States of Zeeland (who did not want him in their midst) first offered to buy the two marquisates, and when he refused, compulsorily bought them, depositing the purchase price in an escrow account.
On a different front the young stadtholder improved his position through a marriage alliance with the British royal house of Hanover. George II of Great Britain was not very secure in his hold on his throne and hoped to strengthen it by offering his daughter Anne in marriage to what he mistook for an influential politician of the Republic, with which, after all old ties existed, reaching back to the Glorious Revolution. At first Van Slingelandt reacted negatively to the proposal with such vehemence that the project was held in abeyance for a few years, but eventually he ran out of excuses and William and Anne were married at St. James's Palace in London in March, 1734. The States-General were barely polite, merely congratulating the king on selecting a son-in-law from "a free republic such as ours." The poor princess, used to a proper royal court, was buried for the next thirteen years in the provincial mediocrity of the stadtholder's court in Leeuwarden.
Nevertheless, the royal marriage was an indication that the Republic was at least still perceived in European capitals as a power that was worth wooing for the other powers. Despite its neutralist preferences the Republic had been dragged into the Alliance of Hanover of 1725. Though this alliance was formally intended to counter the alliance between Austria and Spain, the Republic hoped it would be a vehicle to manage the king of Prussia, who was trying to get his hands on the Duchy of Jülich that abutted Dutch territory, and threatened to engulf Dutch Generality Lands in Prussian territory.
These are just examples of the intricate minuets European diplomats danced in this first third of the 18th century and in which Van Slingelandt tried his best to be the dance master. The Republic almost got involved in the War of the Polish Succession, to such an extent that it was forced to increase its army just at the time it had hoped to be able to reduce it appreciably. Van Slingelandt played an important part as an intermediary in bringing about peace in that conflict between the Bourbon and Habsburg powers in 1735.
Decline of the Republic.
The political history of the Republic after the Peace of Utrecht, but before the upheavals of the 1740s, is characterized by a certain blandness (not only in the Republic, to be sure; the contemporary long-lasting Ministry of Robert Walpole in Great Britain equally elicits little passion). In Dutch historiography the sobriquet "Pruikentijd" (periwig era) is often used, in a scornful way. This is because one associates it with the long decline of the Republic in the political, diplomatic and military fields, that may have started earlier, but became manifest toward the middle of the century. The main cause of this decline lay, however, in the economic field.
The Republic became a Great Power in the middle of the 17th century because of the primacy of its trading system. The riches its merchants, bankers and industrialists accumulated enabled the Dutch state to erect a system of public finance that was unsurpassed for early modern Europe. That system enabled it to finance a military apparatus that was the equal of those of far larger contemporary European powers, and thus to hold its own in the great conflicts around the turn of the 18th century. The limits of this system were however reached at the end of the War of Spanish Succession, and the Republic was financially exhausted, just like France.
However, unlike France, the Republic was unable to restore its finances in the next decades and the reason for this inability was that the health of the underlying economy had already started to decline. The cause of this was a complex of factors. First and foremost, the "industrial revolution" that had been the basis of Dutch prosperity in the Golden Age, went into reverse. Because of the reversal of the secular trend of European price levels around 1670 (secular inflation turning into deflation) and the downward-stickiness of nominal wages, Dutch real wages (already high in boom times) became prohibitively high for the Dutch export industries, making Dutch industrial products uncompetitive. This competitive disadvantage was magnified by the protectionist measures that first France, and after 1720 also Prussia, the Scandinavian countries, and Russia took to keep Dutch industrial export products out. Dutch export industries were therefore deprived of their major markets and withered at the vine.
The contrast with Great Britain, that was confronted with similar challenges at the time, is instructive. English industry would have become equally uncompetitive, but it was able to compensate for the loss of markets in Europe, by its grip on captive markets in its American colonies, and in the markets in Portugal, Spain, and the Spanish colonial empire it had gained (replacing the Dutch) as a consequence of the Peace of Utrecht. This is where the British really gained, and the Dutch really lost, from that peculiar peace deal. The Republic lacked the imperial power, large navy, and populous colonies that Great Britain used to sustain its economic growth.
The decline in Dutch exports (especially textiles) caused a decline in the "rich" trades also, because after all, trade is always two-sided. The Republic could not just offer bullion, as Spain had been able to do in its heyday, to pay for its imports. It is true that the other mainstay of Dutch trade: the carrying trade in which the Republic offered shipping services, for a long time remained important. The fact that the Republic was able to remain neutral in most wars that Great Britain fought, and that Dutch shipping enjoyed immunity from English inspection for contraband, due to the Treaty of Breda (1667) (confirmed at the Treaty of Westminster (1674)), certainly gave Dutch shipping a competitive advantage above its less fortunate competitors, added to the already greater efficiency that Dutch ships enjoyed. (The principle of "free ship, free goods" made Dutch shippers the carriers-of-choice for belligerent and neutral alike, to avoid confiscations by the British navy). But these shipping services did not have an added value comparable to that of the "rich trades." In any case, though the volume of the Dutch Baltic trade remained constant, the volume of that of other countries grew. The Dutch Baltic trade declined therefore "relatively".
During the first half of the 18th century the "rich trades" from Asia, in which the VOC played a preponderant role, still remained strong, but here also superficial flowering was deceptive. The problem was low profitability. The VOC for a while dominated the Malabar and Coromandel coasts in India, successfully keeping its English, French, and Danish competitors at bay, but by 1720 it became clear that the financial outlay for the military presence it had to maintain, outweighed the profits. The VOC therefore quietly decided to abandon India to its competitors. Likewise, though the VOC followed the example of its competitors in changing its "business model" in favor of wholesale trade in textiles, Chinaware, tea and coffee, from the old emphasis of the high-profit spices (in which it had a near-monopoly), and grew to double its old size, becoming the largest company in the world, this was mainly "profitless growth."
Ironically, this relative decline of the Dutch economy through increased competition from abroad was partly due to the behavior of Dutch capitalists. The Dutch economy had grown explosively in the 17th century because of retention and reinvestment of profits. Capital begat capital. However, the fastly accumulating fund of Dutch capital had to be profitably reinvested. Because of the structural changes in the economic situation investment opportunities in the Dutch economy became scarcer just at the time when the perceived risk of investing in more lucrative ventures abroad became smaller. Dutch capitalists therefore started on a large foreign direct investment boom, especially in Great Britain, where the "Dutch" innovations in the capital market (e.g. the funded public debt) after the founding of the Bank of England in 1696 had promoted the interconnection of the capital markets of both countries. Ironically, Dutch investors now helped finance the EIC, the Bank of England itself, and many other English economic ventures that helped to bring about rapid economic growth in England at the same time that growth in the Republic came to a standstill.
This continued accumulation of capital mostly accrued to a small capitalist elite that slowly acquired the characteristics of a "rentier"-class. This type of investor was risk-averse and therefore preferred investment in liquid, financial assets like government bonds (foreign or domestic) over productive investments like shipping, mercantile inventory, industrial stock or agricultural land, like its ancestors had held. They literally had a vested interest in the funded public debt of the Dutch state, and as this elite was largely the same as the political elite (both Orangist and States Party) their political actions were often designed to protect that interest. Unlike in other nation states in financial difficulty, defaulting on the debt, or diluting its value by inflation, would be unthinkable; the Dutch state fought for its public credit to the bitter end. At the same time, anything that would threaten that credit was anathema to this elite. Hence the wish of the government to avoid policies that would threaten its ability to service the debt, and its extreme parsimony in public expenditures after 1713 (which probably had a negative Keynesian effect on the economy also).
Of course, the economic decline eroded the revenue base on which the debt service depended. This was the main constraint on deficit spending, not the lending capacity of Dutch capitalists. Indeed, in later emergencies the Republic had no difficulty in doubling, even redoubling the public debt, but because of the increased debt service this entailed, such expansions of the public debt made the tax burden unbearable in the public's view. That tax burden was borne unequally by the several strata of Dutch society, as it was heavily skewed toward excises and other indirect taxes, whereas wealth, income and commerce were as yet lightly taxed, if at all. The result was that the middle strata of society were severely squeezed in the declining economic situation, characterized by increasing poverty of the lower strata. And the regents were well aware of this, which increased their reluctance to augment the tax burden, so as to avoid public discontent getting out of hand. A forlorn hope, as we will see.
The States-Party regime therefore earnestly attempted to keep expenditure low. And as we have seen, this meant primarily economizing on military expenditures, as these comprised the bulk of the federal budget. The consequence was what amounted to unilateral disarmament (though fortunately this was only dimly perceived by predatory foreign powers, who for a long time remained duly deterred by the fierce reputation the Republic had acquired under the stadtholderate of William III). Disarmament necessitated a modest posture in foreign affairs exactly at the time that foreign protectionist policies might have necessitated diplomatic countermeasures, backed by military might (as the Republic had practiced against Scandinavian powers during the first stadtholderless period). Of course, the Republic could have retaliated peacefully (as it did in 1671, when it countered France's Colbert tariff list, with equally draconian tariffs on French wine), but because the position of the Dutch entrepot (which gave it a stranglehold on the French wine trade in 1671) had declined appreciably also, this kind of retaliation would be self-defeating. Equally, protectionist measures like Prussia's banning of all textile imports in the early 1720s (to protect its own infant textile industry) could not profitably be emulated by the Dutch government, because the Dutch industry was already mature and did not need protection; it needed foreign markets, because the Dutch home market was too small for it to be profitable.
All of this goes to show that (also in hindsight) it is not realistic to blame the States-Party regime for the economic malaise. Even if they had been aware of the underlying economic processes (and this is doubtful, though some contemporaries were, like Isaac de Pinto in his later published "Traité de la Circulation et du Crédit") it is not clear what they could have done about it, as far as the economy as a whole is concerned, though they could arguably have reformed the public finances. As it was, only a feeble attempt to restructure the real estate tax ("verponding") was made by Van Slingelandt, and later an attempt to introduce a primitive form of income tax (the "Personeel Quotisatie" of 1742).
The economic decline caused appalling phenomena, like the accelerating deindustrialization after the early 1720s. Because less replacement and new merchant vessels were required with a declining trade level, the timber trade and shipbuilding industry of the Zaan district went into a disastrous slump, the number of shipyards declining from over forty in 1690 to twenty-three in 1750.
The linen-weaving industry was decimated in Twenthe and other inland areas, as was the whale oil, sail-canvas and rope-making industry in the Zaan. And these are only a few examples. And deindustrialization brought deurbanization with it, as the job losses drove the urban population to rural areas where they still could earn a living. As a consequence, uniquely in early-18th-century Europe, Dutch cities shrunk in size, where everywhere else countries became more urbanized, and cities grew.
Of course these negative economic and social developments had their influence on popular opinion and caused rising political discontent with the stadtholderless regime. It may be that (as Dutch historians like L.J. Rogier have argued) there had been a marked deterioration in the quality of regent government, with a noticeable increase in corruption and nepotism (though coryphaei of the stadtholderate eras like Cornelis Musch, Johan Kievit and Johan van Banchem had been symptomatic of the same endemic sickness during the heyday of the Stadtholderate), though people were more tolerant of this than nowadays. It certainly was true that the governing institutions of the Republic were perennially deadlocked, and the Republic had become notorious for its indecisiveness (though, again this might be exaggerated). Though blaming the regents for the economic "malaise" would be equally unjust as blaming the Chinese emperors for losing the favor of Heaven, the Dutch popular masses were equally capable of such a harsh judgment as the Chinese ones.
What remained for the apologists of the regime to defend it from the Orangist attacks was the claim that it promoted "freedom" in the sense of the "True Freedom" of the De Witt regime from the previous stadtholderless regime, with all that comprised: religious and intellectual toleration, and the principle that power is more responsibly wielded, and exercised in the public interest, if it is dispersed, with the dynastic element, embodied in the stadtholderate, removed. The fervently anti-Orangist regent Levinus Ferdinand de Beaufort added a third element: that the regime upheld civil freedom and the dignity of the individual, in his "Verhandeling van de vryheit in den Burgerstaet" (Treatise about freedom in the Civilian State; 1737). This became the centerpiece of a broad public polemic between Orangists and anti-Orangists about the ideological foundation of the alternative regimes, which was not without importance for the underpinning of the liberal revolutions later in the century. In it the defenders of the stadtholderless regime reminded their readers that the stadtholders had always acted like enemies of the "true freedom" of the Republic, and that William III had usurped an unacceptable amount of power. Tragically, these warnings would be ignored in the crisis that ended the regime in the next decade.
Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747.
Van Slingelandt was succeeded after his death in office in 1736 by Anthonie van der Heim as Grand Pensionary, be it after a protracted power struggle. He had to promise in writing that he would oppose the resurrection of the stadtholderate. He was a compromise candidate, maintaining good relations with all factions, even the Orangists. He was a competent administrator, but of necessity a colourless personage, of whom it would have been unreasonable to expect strong leadership.
During his term in office the Republic slowly drifted into the War of Austrian Succession, which had started as a Prusso-Austrian conflict, but in which eventually all the neighbors of the Republic became involved: Prussia and France, and their allies on one side, and Austria and Great Britain (after 1744) and their allies on the other. At first the Republic strove mightily to remain neutral in this European conflict. Unfortunately, the fact that it maintained garrisons in a number of fortresses in the Austrian Netherlands implied that it implicitly defended that country against France (though that was not the Republic's intent). At times the number of Dutch troops in the Austrian Netherlands was larger than the Austrian contingent. This enabled the Austrians to fight with increased strength elsewhere. The French had an understandable grievance and made threatening noises. This spurred the Republic to bring its army finally again up to European standards (84,000 men in 1743).
In 1744 the French made their first move against the Dutch at the barrier fortress of Menen, which surrendered after a token resistance of a week. Encouraged by this success the French next invested Tournai, another Dutch barrier fortress. This prompted the Republic to join the Quadruple Alliance of 1745 and the relieving army under Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. This met a severe defeat at the hands of French Marshal Maurice de Saxe at the Battle of Fontenoy in May, 1745. The Austrian Netherlands now lay open for the French, especially as the Jacobite rising of 1745 opened a second front in the British homeland, which necessitated the urgent recall of Cumberland with most of his troops, soon followed by an expeditionary force of 6,000 Dutch troops (which could be hardly spared), which the Dutch owed due to their guarantee of the Hanoverian regime in Great Britain. During 1746 the French occupied most big cities in the Austrian Netherlands. Then, in April 1747, apparently as an exercise in armed diplomacy, a relatively small French army occupied States Flanders.
This relatively innocuous invasion fully exposed the rottenness of the Dutch defenses, as if the French had driven a pen knife into a rotting windowsill. The consequences were spectacular. The Dutch population, still mindfull of the French invasion in the Year of Disaster of 1672, went into a state of blind panic (though the actual situation was far from desperate as it had been in that year). As in 1672 the people started clamoring for a restoration of the stadtholderate. This did not necessarily improve matters militarily. William IV, who had been waiting in the wings impatiently since he got his vaunted title of Prince of Orange back in 1732, was no great military genius, as he proved at the Battle of Lauffeld, where he led the Dutch contingent shortly after his elevation in May, 1747 to stadtholder in all provinces, and to captain-general of the Union. The war itself was brought to a not-too-devastating end for the Republic with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), and the French retreated of their own accord from the Dutch frontier.
The popular revolution of April, 1747, started (understandably, in view of the nearness of the French invaders) in Zeeland, where the States post-haste restored William's position as First Noble in the States (and the marquisates they had compulsorily bought in 1732). The restoration of the stadtholderate was proclaimed (under pressure of rioting at Middelburg and Zierikzee) on April 28.
Then the unrest spread to Holland. The city of Rotterdam was soon engulfed in orange banners and cockades and the "vroedschap" was forced to propose the restoration of the stadtholderate in Holland, too. Huge demonstrations of Orangist adherents followed in The Hague, Dordrecht and other cities in Holland. The Holland States begged the Prince's representatives, Willem Bentinck van Rhoon, a son of William III's faithful retainer William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, and Willem van Haren, grietman of Het Bildt to calm the mob that was milling outside their windows. People started wearing orange. In Amsterdam "a number of Republicans and Catholics, who refused to wear orange emblems, were thrown in the canals."
Holland proclaimed the restoration of the stadtholderate and the appointment of William IV to it on May 3. Utrecht and Overijssel followed by mid-May. All seven provinces (plus Drenthe) now recognized William IV as stadtholder, technically ending the second stadtholderless period. But the stadtholderless regime was still in place. The people started to express their fury at the representatives of this regime, and incidentally at Catholics, whose toleration apparently still enraged the Calvinist followers of the Orangist ideology (just as the revolution of 1672 had been accompanied by agitation against minority Protestant sects). Just like in 1672 this new popular revolt had democratic overtones also: people demanded popular involvement in civic government, reforms to curb corruption and financial abuses, a programme to revive commerce and industry, and (peculiarly in modern eyes) stricter curbs on swearing in public and desecrating the sabbath.
At first William, satisfied with his political gains, did nothing to accede to these demands. Bentinck (who had a keen political mind) saw farther and advised the purge of the leaders of the States Party: Grand Pensionary Jacob Gilles (who had succeeded Van der Heim in 1746), secretary of the "raad van state" Adriaen van der Hoop, and sundry regents and the leaders of the "ridderschappen" in Holland and Overijssel. Except for Van der Hoop, for the moment nobody was removed, however. But the anti-Catholic riots continued, keeping unrest at a fever pitch. Soon this unrest was redirected in a more political direction by agitators like Daniel Raap. These started to support Bentinck's demands for the dismissal of the States-Party regents. But still William did nothing. Bentinck started to fear that this inaction would disaffect the popular masses and undermine support for the stadtholderate.
Nevertheless, William, and his wife Princess Anne, were not unappreciative of the popular support for the Orangist cause. He reckoned that mob rule would cow the regents and make them suitably pliable to his demands. The advantages of this were demonstrated when in November, 1747, the city of Amsterdam alone opposed making the stadtholderate hereditary in both the male and female lines of William IV (who had only a daughter at the time). Raap, and another agitator, Jean Rousset de Missy, now orchestrated more mob violence in Amsterdam in support of the proposal, which duly passed.
In May 1747 the States of Utrecht were compelled to readopt the Government Regulations of 1675, which had given William III such a tight grip on the province. Gelderland and Overijssel soon had to follow, egged on by mob violence. Even Groningen and Friesland, William's "own" provinces, who had traditionally allowed their stadtholder very limited powers, were put under pressure to give him greatly extended prerogatives. Mob violence broke out in Groningen in March 1748. William refused to send federal troops to restore order. Only then did the Groningen States make far-reaching concessions that gave William powers comparable to those in Utrecht, Overijssel and Gelderland. Equally, after mob violence in May 1748 in Friesland the States were forced to request a Government Regulation on the model of the Utrecht one, depriving them of their ancient privileges.
The unrest in Friesland was the first to exhibit a new phase in the revolution. There not only the regents were attacked but also the tax farmers. The Republic had long used tax farming, because of its convenience. The revenue of excises and other transaction taxes was uncertain, as it was dependent on the phase of the business cycle. The city governments (who were mainly responsible for tax gathering) therefore preferred to auction off the right to gather certain taxes to entrepreneurs for fixed periods. The entrepreneur paid a lump sum in advance and tried to recoup his outlay from the citizens who were liable for the tax, hoping to pocket the surplus of the actual tax revenue over the lump sum. Such a surplus was inherent in the system and did not represent an abuse in itself. However, abuses in actual tax administration were often unavoidable and caused widespread discontent. The tax riots in Friesland soon spread to Holland. Houses of tax farmers were ransacked in Haarlem, Leiden, The Hague, and especially Amsterdam. The riots became known as the Pachtersoproer. The civic militia refused to intervene, but used the riots as an occasion to present their own political demands: the right of the militia to elect their own officers; the right of the people to inspect tax registers; publication of civil rights so that people would know what they were; restoration of the rights of the guilds; enforcement of the laws respecting the sabbath; and preference for followers of Gisbertus Voetius as preachers in the public church. Soon thereafter the tax farms were abolished, though the other demands remained in abeyance.
There now appeared to be two streams of protest going on. On the one hand Orangist agitators, orchestrated by Bentinck and the stadtholder's court, continued to demand political concessions from the regents by judicially withholding troops to restore order, until their demands were met. On the other hand, there were more ideologically inspired agitators, like Rousset de Missy, who (quoting John Locke's "Two Treatises on Government") tried to introduce "dangerous ideas," like the ultimate sovereignty of the people as a justification for enlisting the support of the people. Such ideas (anathema to both the clique around the stadtholder and the old States Party regents) were "en vogue" with a broad popular movement under the middle strata of the population, that aimed to make the government answerable to the people. This movement, known as the "Doelisten" (because they often congregated in the target ranges of the civic militia, which in Dutch were called the "doelen") presented demands to the Amsterdam "vroedschap" in the summer of 1748 that the burgomasters should henceforth be made popularly electable, as also the directors of the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC.
This more radical wing more and more came into conflict with the moderates around Bentinck and the stadtholder himself. The States of Holland, now thoroughly alarmed by these "radical" developments, asked the stadtholder to go to Amsterdam in person to restore order by whatever means necessary. When the Prince visited the city on this mision in September 1748 he talked to representatives of both wings of the "Doelisten". He was reluctant to accede to the demands of the radicals that the Amsterdam "vroedschap" should be purged, though he had to change his mind under pressure of huge demonstrations favoring the radicals. The purge fell, however, far short of what the radicals had hoped for. The new "vroedschap" still contained many members of the old regent families. The Prince refused to accede to further demands, leaving the Amsterdam populace distinctly disaffected. This was the first clear break between the new regime and a large part of its popular following.
Similar developments ensued in other Holland cities: William's purges of the city governments in response to popular demand were halfhearted and fell short of expectations, causing further disaffection. William was ready to promote change, but only as far as it suited him. He continued to promote the introduction of government regulations, like those of the inland provinces, in Holland also. These were intended to give him a firm grip on government patronage, so as to entrench his loyal placements in all strategic government positions. Eventually he managed to achieve this aim in all provinces. People like Bentinck hoped that gathering the reins of power in the hands of a single "eminent head" would soon help restore the state of the Dutch economy and finances. Such high hopes for an "enlightened despot" were not unique to the Republic at the time. In Portugal people had the same hopes of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal and king Joseph I of Portugal, as had people in Sweden of Gustav III of Sweden.
Whether William IV would have been up to such expectations we will unfortunately never know, as he suddenly died, at the age of 40, on October 22, 1751.
Aftermath.
The fact that giving dictatorial powers to a "strong man" is often bad politics, and usually leads to severe disappointment, was once again demonstrated in the aftermath of William IV's short stadtholderate. He was immediately succeeded as hereditary "Stadtholder-General" in all provinces by William V, Prince of Orange, all of three years at the time. Of course, his mother was immediately charged with the regency, and she delegated most of its powers to Bentinck and her favorite, Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The Duke was made captain-general of the Union (the first time a non-stadtholder achieved the full rank; even Marlborough had only been "lieutenant"—captain-general) in 1751 and held that position until William's majority in 1766. His was not a happy regency. It was characterized by excessive corruption and misrule as the Republic had not yet seen. The Duke cannot be fully blamed for that personally, as he seems to have been well-intentioned in general. But the fact that all power now was concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few, like the Frisian nobleman Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins, made abuse of power all the more likely (as the proponents of the "True Freedom" had often warned).
After the coming of age of the new stadtholder, the Duke retreated into the shadows, but a secret "Acte van Consulentschap" (Act of Advisorship) ensured his continued influence over the young and not very decisive Prince, whereas Bentinck lost influence. The Duke was very unpopular (he was the target of assassination attempts), which eventually led to his removal on the insistence of the new manifestation of the States Party: the Patriots. The Prince now tried to govern alone, but as his competence fell short he only managed to hasten the fall of his regime. What had been gained by deft exploitation of mob violence in 1747, could be taken away by equally deft use of popular unrest in the early and middle 1780s. The mishandling of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War by the stadtholderate caused a political and economic crisis in the Republic, with resulted in the Patriot Revolution of 1785-87, which in turn was suppressed by Prussian intervention. The Prince was enabled to continue his autocratic government for a few more years until he was driven into exile in January, 1795, after an invasion by French revolutionary armies, that brought the Batavian Republic into being.

<doc id="18516401" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18516401" title="Rociu">
Rociu

Rociu is a commune in Argeş County, in southern central Romania. It is composed of four villages: Gliganu de Jos, Gliganu de Sus, Rociu and Şerbăneşti.
History.
The oldest relicves come from the Bronze Age, from Şerbăneşti Village. Then, much later, the village Gliganu is mentioned, on June 12, 1564. The village belonged to a boyar from Rucăr. According to the same source, all four villages are mentioned after 1830.
In the Communist period, the commune received a strong impulse for economic growth: A 25 km long irrigation canal was built to drain water from the Argeş River. Rociu received special attention because there was built a farm of the Communist Party.
Location.
Rociu is situated in the southern part of the Argeş county, in the Găvanu-Burdea plains. It is situated 25 to 30 kilometers from Piteşti, the main town of the county. The average altitude is 240 meters.
Villages.
There are 4 villages: "Rociu", "Gliganu de Jos", "Gliganu de Sus" and "Şerbăneşti".
Geography.
The Găvanu-Burdea plain is a flat region, with large and fertile valleys. Rociu is situated close to the Dîmbovnic River (sometimes called Dâmbovnic or Drâmbovnic). There are a few smaller rivers that are dry in summer, like Mozacu River and Gliganu River. There are many small lakes, used for fishing.
Climate.
Rociu has a temperate climate, like all Romanian villages. Usually, summers are hot and winters have frequent winds.
Demographics.
According to the 2002 census, the commune has 3014 people, of which 2968 are Romanians and 46 are Gipsy (Roma people). Also, the population is dramatically aged: 40% are older than 60 years, and children are only 12% of the total population. 99% are Orthodox.
Transportation.
There are a few "county roads" that link the commune with Piteşti and the nearby villages:
The "communal roads" link the villages one to another:
Economy.
There are no major firms in the area. The main occupation is agriculture. There are two major agricultural companies, a few mills, a small pig farm, a paper factory and a lot of small markets and pubs that provide the population with daily goods. There is a fair every Tuesday.
Since the economy is based on agriculture, the old irrigation canal might still be used. Today, it only brings water to local fishing lakes.
Institutions.
The town hall is located in the Rociu village. Near the town hall are the post office and the Veterinarian and Human services. Not far away is the politic centre, of the Social Democratic Party. There is a school and a church in each village.
Environmental problems.
Upstream, on the Dîmbovnic River, is an important oil refinery, the Arpechim Refinery. Since its construction, nearly all the toxic waste was released in the river. In 2005, the situation was so bad, that water in the fountains was no longer drinkable, even for animals. The only solution to provide water for the inhabitants and their animals was to use the deep freatic waters (about 200 meters deep) and to build an extensive system of water pipes to every house. Today, the river is only occasionally polluted and even fish have reappeared after more than 50 years.
Tourism.
Rociu is not a tourist destination and has no hotels or camp sites. However, not far away, in Negraşi is a protected area, Poiana cu Narcise Negraşi (or in English, Negraşi Daffodil Meadow).
There is an old church in Şerbăneşti village, that is considered a touristic objective.
Unofficial resort?
The commune has multiple access routes (see #Transportation). Being situated more than 25 km from any big city, Rociu has very clean air. The water is pumped from 150 to 200 meters deep and is of very good quality (see #Environmental problems). According to the police of Arge County, violent incidents are very rare and there are no major conflicts. Houses and terrains can be found (to buy or to rent) at very small costs. All these facts create conditions for elderly people to come and settle in Rociu and nearby villages after they retire from work. This population migration partially explains the population dynamics mentioned above, in #Demographics.

Spicule (glass manufacture)

Spicules are tiny glass flakes which are formed during the manufacture of glass vials. A glass tube is extruded at a constant rate and a jet of water applied to the hot glass is used to cut the blank tube to length. The bottom and lip of the vial are formed by swagging or upset forming while the glass is still hot. 
Spicules are formed in a cloud when the glass explodes from the contact of the cold jet. These are held to the glass blank during forming, and if the vial is not reheated or cleaned after manufacture, these spicules can drift off into the mixture subsequently placed in the vial. This is a serious problem in the manufacture of soft contact lenses or pharmaceutical products.

Bottle Pop

"Bottle Pop" is a song by American girl group The Pussycat Dolls from their second album, "Doll Domination" (2008). The song was written and produced by Sean Garrett and Fernando Garibay with additional writing from Nicole Scherzinger and co-produced by Clubba Langg. Snoop Dogg is featured only in the album version while its music video release came without his contribution. Musically, the song features sexual innuendo, funky electronica and is backed by electro beats.
Critical reception of "Bottle Pop" was mixed, as some reviewers criticized Snoop Dogg's appearance describing it as sleepwalking guest parts, while others called it the best track from "Doll Domination". The song managed to peak at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play, while it peaked at number seventeen in Australia and New Zealand. In Belgium it peaked at number nine.
The accompanying music video for the single was by Thomas Kloss. In the video, The Dolls are seen dancing in a theater wearing sexy, space-age, metallic and colorful outfits and towards the end, they are joined by several male backing dancers. Critics complimented the colorful outfits. The song was performed on the Doll's Doll Domination Tour and on the annual "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest" performing the same routine.
Background and composition.
Following the commercial success of The Pussycat Dolls' debut album "PCD" (2005), lead vocalist Nicole Scherzinger opted to pursue in her solo career, and began to work on her own solo album under the title, "Her Name is Nicole". However due to poor lack of success of her singles, Scherzinger focused back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album, "Doll Domination".
"Bottle Pop" was co-written by Sean Garrett, Fernando Garibay and Nicole Scherzinger. Production of the song was helmed Sean "The Pen" Garret and Garibay while Clubba Langg served as a co-producer. Snoop Dogg appears courtesy of Doggy Style Records/Geffen Records. Scherzinger's vocals were recorded by Miles Walker with the assistance of Mike Hogue, Chris Kasych, and Brian Schunck at Chalice Studios in Los Angeles and Record Plant in Hollywood, while Snoop Dogg's vocals were recorded by Chris Jackson at Irvine Spot in Irvine, California. It was mixed by Tony Maserati at Cannan Road Studios in New York. The keyboards were played by Kennard Garrett and Raymond "Rayza" Oglesby while Oglesby also handled the Additional Drum Programming. All instrumentation and programming was carried out by Garret and Garibay.
Musically the song features sexual innuendo, funky electronica and is backed by electro beats; Nicole Scherzinger has uses breathy vocals while singing the song. Jim Farber of Daily News said that the song has a "moronic hook you can't resist". Jaime Gill of Yahoo! UK & Ireland noted that Scherzinger sounds like Gwen Stefani. Steve Perkins from BBC – Chart Blog said that rhythmically and melodically is influenced by Flo Rida's "Low" and Ciara's "Goodies"/Petey Pablo's "Freek-A-Leek", but with added PCD sass.
Reception.
Critical.
Reviews for "Bottle Pop" were mixed. MusicOMH music reviewer Nic Oliver described Snoop Dogg's and Missy Elliott's parts as "sleepwalking guest parts." He also noted that the lyrics were written by sophomore student. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic called the Snoop Doggs cameo "a phoned-in". Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music UK described "Bottle Pop" as "heavily treated". 
However, music critic Jim Farber commented that "'Bottle Pop' has a moronic hook you can't resist". Stuart Derdeyn called the song one of the best tracks of the album. "'Bottle Pop' boasts a Snoop Dogg rap that he could've come up with in his sleep, but Sean Garrett's production is sharp." Nick Levine from Digital Spy, in a review for "Doll Domination", compared the sound to Britney Spears' "Blackout". Bill Lamb from About.com particularly saying "'Bottle Pop' seems to be trying to mine a Britney Spears 'Piece of Me' groove.
Commercial.
Upon the release of "Doll Domination", "Bottle Pop" managed to chart on the Canadian Hot 100 at position 88, on the issue dated October 11, 2008. In the United States the song debuted at number 48 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart on March 21, 2009. On May 16, 2009 the song managed to peak at number one, becoming the fifth song from the Pussycat Dolls to peak at number one in as many tries. It also became Snoop Doggs' fourth consecutive chat-topper. In Australia, the song debuted at twenty-five, on March 15, 2009. In the next week it peaked at number seventeen. In New Zealand, the song managed to debut using the remix with Devolo. In its next week it peaked at number seventeen.
Music video.
The video was directed by Thomas Kloss. In MTV News, Scherzinger talked about the music video: "It's gonna be so much fun. It's gonna be a dance video. Obviously, you can tell by our wardrobe, it's going to be very colorful and fun ... freaky fun! You guys are going to be wanting to pop some bottles after this one." The video premiered at February 9, 2009. The video features the Dolls breaking into a theater and performing the songs choreography on the stage before a doll-themed backdrop. The male dancers that accompanied the dolls on tour appear towards the end of the video, performing a dance break with them. Snoop Dogg does not appear in the video.
MTV's Jocelyn Vena commented that "The Pussycat Dolls have made a career out of the lethal combination of barely there costumes, big hair and lots of makeup. And seeing them decked out on the set of their new music video for 'Bottle Pop' it is clear that they want the look to illustrate the song they describe as 'freaky fun'." Alison Maloney from "The Sun" noted that the Dolls were "cavorting in sexy, space-age, metallic outfits for the promo". Jennifer Trevorrow from "Entertainment Wise" agreed saying " look puurfect as they show off their trademark moves in a selection of colorful outfits and glamorous makeup". However some criticism did follow the video. Sound Savvy said, "all their videos look the same – sexy (and slightly slutty) get-ups, choreographed dance routines, and Nicole in the spotlight. Bottom line: ya seen one, ya seen ‘em all…*YAWN* Is their time up yet?"
Live performances.
"Bottle Pop" was performed live for the first time at the 2008 "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest".

Wingina, Virginia

Wingina is an unincorporated community in Nelson County, Virginia, USA.
History.
This area was originally inhabited by Native Americans of the Monacan Indian tribe. The Monacan tribe and their allies, the Mannahoac, had settled central Virginia from the Rappahannock River to the James River for at least 500 years before the English arrived in Virginia. As the English encroached farther west into what is now central Virginia, the Native Americans dispersed to the north, south, and west. In the 19th century a number of Monacans created a settlement at Bear Mountain in Amherst County, where many of the tribe live today. The Saponi and Tutelo Indians are also remnants of this main confederacy. This village located on the banks of the James River between Buckingham and Nelson counties was part of the original land grant of Dr. William Cabell in 1735. Dr. Cabell received the grant of 25,000 acres from King George II. The Europeans first called this area "Hardwicksville".
The small town of Wingina is located south of Lovingston, situated on James River Road (SR 56) at the James River Bridge and the C&O railroad (known as Wingina Station), where the Wingina Post office and general store now stands. On the western side of Rte. 56 are the areas known as Union Hill and Norwood. On the eastern side of this road are the areas known as Midway Mills, Warminster, and Edgewood. This entire area was owned by the Cabell family.
About five miles above this area on this same road, heading towards the town of Shipman, is Glade Rd., also known as Secretary's Rd. and "Warriors Path". This road was used by the Monacan and Powhatan Confederations for hunting and war between the local tribes, consisting of Siouan-speaking (Monacan and Mannahoac) and Iroquoian-speaking groups (Cherokee). Beginning as a dirt path through the wilderness, the road was formed by the natives walking in single file. Their feet were set down from heel to toe, the advancing foot always on the line with their rear foot. The years of single file journeys had worn a deep narrow trail, crossing streams where fords were established. This trail stretched from the Rockfish River, down through Findlay's Gap into Amherst. As the area began to grow with early white settlers, this main Indian trail was widened and maintained by the local African slaves to accommodate horses and oxen, then to provide access to stagecoaches and wagons.
In 1853, the canal company owned by Joseph Carrington Cabell built a covered wooden bridge over the James River at Wingina, which was used during the American Civil War. The bridge was eventually burned by the Confederate army to prevent General Sheridan's army from crossing in their effort to cut off General Lee's retreat to Petersburg.
In 1880, the Richmond Allegheny Railroad purchased the property around the canal and named this area "Wingina" after a Secotan Indian chief of the 16th century who resisted the encroachment of the Europeans.
In 1890, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad (C&O) acquired the property, and in 1905 the company constructed a steel-trussed bridge over the James River on the original stone piers of the earlier wooden bridge.
In 1920, the Johnson family, who owned a building supply store, moved from Buckingham County over to Wingina and established the Wingina General Store and Post Office. The store supplied the railroad ties for the C&O railroad. John Yarborough served as the first postmaster. The general store closed in 1991 and is no longer there, but the post office, now run by the Wood family, still services both areas of Buckingham and Wingina, maintaining two area codes.
Edgewood and Soldier's Joy are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Santee Town Center (San Diego Trolley station)

Santee Town Center is a San Diego Trolley station in Santee, California. It began service on August 26, 1995 as the new terminus of the then-named East Line (renamed the Orange Line in 1997) after the opening of the fourth segment of that line. It now marks the eastern terminus of Green Line, and serves as a major park and ride station for the large suburb of Santee. The station is inside a shopping center on the northeast quadrant of the intersection of Mission Gorge Road and Cuyamaca Street.
Prior to July 2005, all Orange Line trolleys used to end at this station. With the introduction of the Green Line service, the Orange Line's terminus was truncated to Gillespie Field and later to El Cajon Transit Center. Since July 2005, all Green Line trolleys serve this station. This is because the path between Gillespie Field and Santee Town Center is single tracked, and having two lines running on that route would cause operational issues. 
From the station's opening in 1995 until September 2005, Santee city law prohibited rail service after 9:00pm. That meant that most trains terminated at El Cajon after 9:00pm. The law was lifted in September 2005 soon after the Green Line began operation to Santee.

Holmes Tuttle

Holmes Tuttle (1906–June 16, 1989) was a successful California businessman and autodealer, and headed President Ronald Reagan's unofficial "Kitchen Cabinet".
Early life and career.
Tuttle was born in Tuttle, Oklahoma (named for his father). He started his automotive career by going to work at the Ford Parts facility in Oklahoma City in 1923 at the age of 17. Although Ford had a policy of not hiring anyone under the age of 21, Tuttle, who stood well over 6 feet, was referred by a banker who knew Tuttles' father. He traveled west in 1926, to Los Angeles, aboard a freight train, until he and his friend, who had talked him into moving to California, were caught by a train agent and thrown off. They convinced a well-to-do lady, whose driver had broken his leg, to let them drive her to California. He was employed as a parts manager at a Ford dealership. He opened his own dealership in 1945, which became known as Holmes Tuttle, Inc. The business was a resounding success and evolved into fourteen dealerships in California and Arizona. One of his first dealerships was located in Los Angeles. In the late 1940s Holmes was offered the national distributorship for a European manufacturer. Tuttle turned it down. He had just lost nearly a million dollars as the distributor of the English Ford and stated that "... if our returning GIs wouldn't buy a car built by our English allies, then they certainly won't buy a car built in Germany called a Volkswagen." In the mid-1950s Ford Motor Co., asked Mr. Tuttle to talk to a dealer in Tucson, Arizona, who was ill and needed to sell his Ford store. After meeting for about 15 minutes, Holmes Tuttle agreed to buy Monte Mansfield Ford. Today, over 50 years later, this dealership is still Holmes Tuttle Ford.
Political involvement.
Though he never held public office, Tuttle was very involved in political affairs of the times. His political involvement began in 1952, when he campaigned for General Dwight D. Eisenhower. He later campaigned for Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, and Gerald Ford as well. According to his son, Robert Tuttle, Holmes was a delegate to every Republican National Convention from 1960 to 1984.
Tuttle led a group of California businessmen as they encouraged movie actor Ronald Reagan to run for Governor of California in 1966. His reasoning was, "Would you rather vote for a candidate who has spent his life in politics, has never really worked for a living, or created jobs in the private sector while clawing his way to the top and who is beholden to many other politicians for his success in Washington? Or would you rather have a candidate who is backed by very successful capitalists who have created dozens of companies and tens of thousands of jobs, people who know what it takes to attain success within our system?"
Upon Reagan's election, Tuttle assisted in screening people for cabinet positions. He later worked on Reagan's 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns. When Reagan was sworn in as president in 1981, Tuttle and fellow businessman Justin Dart "sat down with the President and gave our impression of the budget. We keep saying the same thing: cut, cut and then cut some more."
Family.
His son Robert Holmes Tuttle worked in the White House under President Reagan, and was later Ambassador to the UK during George W. Bush's second term.
His grandnephew is Jim Click, one of the largest auto dealers in southern Arizona.
Death.
Tuttle died at Cottage Hospital in Montecito, California, aged 83 in 1989. According to his son, Tuttle died of complications stemming from a stroke he suffered several weeks prior.

Ghimeș-Făget

Ghimeş-Făget (, Hungarian pronunciation: or sometimes "Nagy-Gyimes") is a commune in Bacău County, Romania. It is the only commune in the county that lies in the historical region of Transylvania.
Component villages.
The commune, the seat of which is Făget village, is composed of six villages:
History.
The village was part of the Székely Land region of the historical Transylvania province. It was first mentioned in 1600 as "Gijmes". The area of the commune belonged to Csíkszék until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the Csík County of the Kingdom of Hungary.
The village was occupied by the Romanian army between 13 to 20 November 1918. Shortly thereafter, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was proclaimed, and the village, like the rest of Transylvania, formally passed with the Treaty of Trianon from Hungarian to Romanian control in 1920. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the village was held by Hungary until 1944. With the Soviet occupation near the end of World War II, the Romanian administration returned and the commune's status as part of Romania was formalized in 1947. 
Until 1918, it was a border village between Hungary and Romania and as such, it had an important and large railway station designed by Hungarian architect Ferenc Pfaff. The main building of the station was 102m long and 13m wide, comparable in size and elegance with the railway stations of Szeged and Fiume.
In 1950, as part of a wider administrative reform, the commune was transferred from Ciuc County to Regiunea Bacău. School education in the Hungarian language was abolished in 1965. Local teacher and school director András Deáky advocated for teaching in Hungarian and re-organized it after 1990. He also established a Hungarian language library from donations of the public.
Demography.
In 2002, it had a population of 5,340; out of them, 2720 were Hungarians, 2522 were Romanians and 71 were Csangos. As to religion, 58.03% of the villagers are Roman Catholics, while 41.44% of them belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church.

Tough Trucks

Tough Trucks, also known as Tuff Trucks, Pro Arena Trucks and, Street Warriors, are off-road truck competitions held at 4x4 truck jamborees and monster truck events. Tough Truck competitions are a downsized form of short course off-road racing. They are run as a side act at most monster truck shows. Depending on venue and promoter, the tracks can range from as big as a football field, to as small as a hockey rink. Most track set ups consist of a handful of double jumps, single banzai jumps, uneven/rocker hills, and dirt kicker ramps, again depending on venue and promoter. Some tracks are run in Chicago Style/Round E Round Track or S-Style Track. Some competitions are run as a single pass time trial, or side by side racing.
History.
Tough Truck competitions can be dated back to the first 4x4 clubs. Friends and other club members would navigate across obstacles courses built to test the vehicle and the drivers capabilities, thus proving who has the "toughest" truck. During the 1980s, family events (also known as special events) implemented a similar competition into their 4-wheel jamboree events. It was simply known as the obstacle course competition. During 1988 and 1989, these events became extremely popular, and with that, 1990 saw the first designated Tough Truck events.
Most early Tough Truck competitions appeared on Truck & Tractor Power television show on The Nashville Network (TNN) along with the coverage of the Monster Trucks and NMRO Mud Drags at 4 Wheel Jamborees. At this time the competition would change nearly every weekend, with someone new entering at almost every event. The more consistent, and recognizable contenders shown most on television were Kevin "Pig Out" Harel, Barb and Jim Alt, "Yeee Haa" David Fontanetta Jr, Bruce "The Moose" Scott, Wes "IceMan" Mantooth, Rory Fisher, "Jumpin" Joe Brosovich, Gary McIver, Peter Griffin, John "MM3" Mury and Troy "Air" Tate. Their most highlighted runs can be seen on a home video series known as Shake, Battle & Roll, which also features monster trucks and mud drags.
USA Motorsports and United States Hot Rod Association also ran Tough Truck Competitions at their events, but not on a large scale. At this time, Tough Truck competitions were set up on a format of whose the best this weekend, instead of having a year long points system.
During the 1997 season, USA Motorsports kickstarted their Tough Truck Competitions with Pro Arena King of the Hill Championship. Former Joliet, Illinois native Joe Brosovich was the first official Tough Truck/Pro Arena King of the Hill Champion. This series saw future championship contenders such as Rick Armbrust, Mike Rosenthal, and Sonny Douhrman.
As of 2001, Special Events/4 Wheel Jamboree's now have NMRO sanctioning the rules for the Mickey Thompson Tires sponsored Tough Truck Challenge. Autumn Woods Racing driver Jeffery Dedick of Wheaton, Illinois is the only person to have claimed 3 titles in the series. Jeff is also a 2 time USHRA Pro Arena Champion.
More recently, due to the revived interest and frequent television exposure in off road racing, USHRA is attempting to do multi-truck racing with Pro Arena Trucks. Stock Tough Trucks at USHRA events are now known as Street Warriors, and are run at smaller venue or outdoor events.
Some off-road racing enthusiasts also managed to create their own Pro Arena Tough Truck Short Course series, running on similar tracks like Championship Off Road Racing or World Series of Off Road Racing. There are also shows have Tough Trucks as the main attraction. Sometimes these events will feature Tough Truck freestyle, which was influenced by of Monster Truck freestyle.
Vehicle classification.
Stock Tough Trucks.
Either spectator entry, daily driver, or "stock" vehicle. Referred to as Street Warriors. Some promoters require some minor safety improvements to vehicles, while others will allow any vehicle the owner wishes to enter. With only the rule of a standard seat belt and D.O.T Helmet. Roll cages are not required but are highly recommended. The ride in these vehicles can be very punishing, therefore some drivers will wear a back brace, neck brace, and kidney belt as extra protection although it is not required. Some Modified Tough Trucks will compete with the stock class. Some find this unfair but, stock trucks and cars have beaten the Modified Trucks on several occasions.
Modified Tough Truck or Pro Arena Truck.
Purpose built truck modified in engine and suspension to withstand the environment of the track, as well as have more safety improvements. Trucks are set up very similar to Sportsman or Sportsman Stock Class in the Pro Short Course Racing. Most of these vehicles however, run fiberglass bodies.

The Anderton Boat Lift Trust is a waterway society in Cheshire, England, UK, and a member of the partnership to restore the Anderton Boat Lift near Northwich on the Weaver Navigation.
The other partners are:
The Anderton Boat Lift, also known as 'The Cathedral of the Canals' or the 'Eiffel Tower of the Waterways', was built in 1875 to transport boats 50 feet from the Trent and Mersey Canal to the River Weaver. It closed in 1983 due to structural faults caused by corrosion. The Anderton Boat Lift Trust was launched in October 1993; it had been campaigning for the restoration of the lift, and succeeded in bringing together all sectors of society. The trust submitted a funding bid to the Heritage Lottery in 1997. The boat lift featured on the BBC2 programme "Restoration". boat lift was re-opened in 2002.
The lift had a successful first summer season, with over 100,000 visitors, 800 boats passing through, and 16,000 taking a ride on the tripboat.

Krasin (1917 icebreaker)

The first icebreaker Krasin () was built for the Imperial Russian Navy as Svyatogor. She had a long, distinguished career in rescue operations, as well as a pathfinder and explorer of the Northern Sea Route. She has been fully restored to operating condition and is now a museum ship in Saint Petersburg.
History and service.
The icebreaker was built by Armstrong Whitworth in Newcastle upon Tyne under the supervision of Yevgeny Zamyatin. The vessel was launched as the "Svyatogor" on 3 August 1916 and completed in February 1917. Up to the beginning of the 1950s she remained the most powerful icebreaker in the world.
During the allied intervention against the Bolsheviks in Northern Russia (1918–19) she was scuttled by the Royal Navy. They raised her for use in the White Sea and later brought her to Scapa Flow for minesweeping.
"Svyatogor" was returned to the USSR under the Krasin trade agreement in 1921. In 1927 this icebreaker was renamed by the Soviet government to honor a recently deceased early Bolshevik leader and Soviet diplomat Leonid Borisovich Krasin.
Perhaps the most famous duty the "Krasin" performed was rescuing General Umberto Nobile and his surviving crew when their airship "Italia" crashed on the ice upon returning form the North Pole in 1928. Later in the same year, "Krasin" rescued the German passenger ship "Monte Cervantes", with 1835 passengers on board, after it hit an iceberg and its hull was severely damaged.
In 1933 "Krasin" became the first vessel to reach the inaccessible northern shores of Novaya Zemlya in the history of navigation. In 1938, the "Krasin" rescued Icebreaker Lenin and her convoy, trapped in ice at the end of the previous summer.
During World War II, "Krasin" participated in many Russian convoys. In 1941 the US Government entered into negotiations with the Russian Government for the purchase or lease of one or more of their modern ice breakers for use by the US Coast Guard on the east coast of Greenland. The "Krasin" was offered, and crossed the Pacific to Bremerton, Washington. She was surveyed and found to be in need of repairs totalling about $500,000. Funds were allocated from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Emergency Fund for the President", but negotiations came to an abrupt end on 25 November 1941. Although the "Krasin" never served in the Coast Guard, the service gained valuable knowledge about icebreakers that was put to use in the design of the Wind class icebreakers.
She continued her journey through the Panama Canal to Great Britain, where she was armed with surface and anti-aircraft guns and proceeded to Reykjavik, Iceland to join convoy PQ-15. She escorted the convoy through the North and Barents Seas, around the Kola Peninsula and into Murmansk. In 1942 the "Krasin" and "Lenin" were spotted at the Mona Islands in the Kara Sea by a Kriegsmarine plane during Operation Wunderland. The heavy cruiser "Admiral Scheer" rushed to find them, but providential bad weather, fog and ice conditions saved the icebreakers from destruction.
Between August 1953 to June 1960, under the East German war reparations program, "Krasin" was extensively reconstructed at VEB Mathias-Thesen-Werft, Wismar, Germany. Until 1971 she served the Arctic Northern Sea Route. Then the icebreaker was used as an Arctic scientific vessel. As of 1998, she was owned by the International Fund for the History of Science, Murmansk and registered at St. Petersburg, where she is docked as a floating museum.
Today.
After the war, the historic icebreaker took an active part in research expeditions in the Polar Ocean and led Soviet cargo convoys through the polar region. Rather than being destroyed (like the Icebreaker "Yermak") to make way for more modern ships, the "Krasin" was preserved and restored. The vessel is now a museum ship in Saint Petersburg, the only icebreaker maritime museum commemorating the Arctic convoys. She has been fully restored to operating condition and there are plans to sail her to various European ports.
An island in the Nordenskiöld Archipelago was named after this icebreaker. Postage stamps and a coin have been issued in her honor.

Emil Kessler

Emil Julius Carl Kessler (20 August 1813 - 16 March 1867) was a German businessman and founder of the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen ('Esslingen Engineering Works').
Biography.
Kessler was born in Baden-Baden, attended school there and later studied constructional and mechanical engineering in Karlsruhe. In 1837 he founded an engineering works with Theodor Martiensen in Karlsruhe, where tools, small machines and railway equipment were manufactured. In 1840/1841 the Royal Württemberg Railway Commission tendered for railway construction and the production of rolling stock to pave the way for the Royal Württemberg State Railways ("Königlich Württembergische Staats-Eisenbahnen"). Kessler's bid was successful and in 1841 he built his first steam locomotive, the "Badenia" for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway ("Großherzoglich Badische Staatsbahn").
From 1842 Kessler was the sole owner of the new firm "Kesslers Maschinenfabrik" ('Kessler's Engineering Works'). In 1848 it was converted into a public limited company, but liquidated on 30 October 1851 and acquired in 1852 by the Baden government. One year later he founded a new company under the name of Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe ('Karlsruhe Engineering Works'), that again took up locomotive building and delivered its first engine in 1854. Because Württemberg also wanted to have its own production facility for the emerging railways, Emil Kessler founded the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen that delivered its first engine in 1847. 
Emil Kessler died on 16 March 1867 in Esslingen am Neckar from a heart attack.

Shad Valley

Shad Valley (colloquially known as Shad) is a Canadian summer enrichment program for high-achieving high school students that runs every year, primarily in July. The program is open to both Canadian and international students, and runs in twelve participating university campuses across Canada, where the students live in residence. It is focused on business, science, mathematics, and engineering. 
The Shad Valley program was founded by Dr. Derek Lane-Smith, a teacher, physicist, and entrepreneur. The first summer program ran at St. Andrew’s College in Aurora, Ontario in July, 1981, and has since expanded to twelve university campuses across Canada.
The Shad Valley program is run by Shad Valley International (formerly known as the Shad Valley Centre for Creative Technology), a non-profit organization based in Waterloo, Ontario. Shad Valley International also ran the Pesk’a Aboriginal Shad Valley Program, which ended in the summer of 2009. Barry Bisson is the current president of Shad Valley International.
There is a rigorous application process, which goes in depth into both the students' academics and extra-curriculars. In 2013, over 1,000 students applied, with over 900 students meeting the requirements for Shad Valley. With only about 50 spots available per campus, 600+ students were accepted.
Program overview.
During the program, students live in residence at one of twelve participating university campuses across Canada. The program is run by university faculty and staff, and focuses on science, engineering, technology, leadership, and entrepreneurship. Each campus plans its own events and activities so schedules and opportunities vary from campus to campus, however each campus has the same basic format and themes. Participants and alumni of the program are often colloquially known as "Shads".
A typical day at Shad Valley can include workshops, seminars, staff and guest lectures, recreation time, and group projects. Students also participate in off-campus day trips, based on the region’s attractions.
Eligibility.
Students in grades ten, eleven, or twelve (Secondaire IV, V, or CEGEP I in Quebec), or the international equivalent, may apply for Shad Valley. Applications deadlines are in late November and mid-December
Program cost.
Shad Valley costs $4,100 CAD for Canadian citizens/permanent residents and $8,000 CAD for international students. Travel expenses to and from the program are not included in the program fee. Financial assistance from Shad Valley International is available.
Shad Valley Entrepreneurship Cup.
Every year, the program is given a project theme. Students collaborate to simulate a start-up venture, based around a product or service that addresses the theme. Groups complete a business plan, marketing plan, promotional strategy package, external resources plan, website, and create a working prototype of their product. One winning project is selected from each campus every year to advance to national judging between the campuses.
The results of the competition are announced during the Shad Valley Entrepreneurship Cup Awards, which takes place every Fall. The awards will be:
The theme for the 2013 Shad Cup was "How Might We Improve the Safety and Efficiency of Year Round, Human Powered Transportation". Previous themes included: "Disaster & Emergency Preparedness" (2004), "Health & Wellness" (2005), "The Great Canadian Energy Challenge" (2006), "Zero Waste Technology" (2007), "Design with Conscience" (2008), "Nature and Natural Fibres" (2009), "Designing for Canada's Aging Population" (2010), "Improving the Quality of Life for a Canadian Child with a Disability" (2011), and "Preventing/Reducing Obesity in North American Youth" (2012).

John Palmer (postal innovator)

John Palmer of Bath (1742 – 16 August 1818) was a theatre owner and instigator of the British system of mail coaches that was the beginning of the great British post office reforms with the introduction of an efficient mail coach delivery service in Great Britain during the late 18th century. He was Mayor of Bath on two occasions and Comptroller General of the Post Office, and later served as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Bath between 1801 and 1807.
Theatre.
Palmer was the eldest son of a prosperous Bath brewer and theatre owner who inherited his father's Old Orchard Street Theatre, and obtained a royal letters patent for it in 1768 which gave him an effective monopoly on playhouses in the city and the right to use the title "Theatre Royal", the first theatre outside London to acquire it. Palmer's second theatre in Bristol was granted the same status in 1778, becoming the Theatre Royal, Bristol. Palmer worked as his father's London agent, frequently travelling between London and Bath, and after his father decided to retire in 1776 the patent was transferred to him. He continued to manage the theatre until 1785. The two theatres shared one acting company, so Palmer had to move his actors, stagehands and props quickly between Bristol and Bath, he set up a coach service which provided safe, quick and efficient transport for his actors and materials. Later, when Palmer became involved in the Post Office, he believed that the coach service he had previously run between theatres could be utilised for a countrywide mail delivery service.
Mail coaches.
The postal delivery service in Britain had existed in the same form for about 150 years—from its introduction in 1635, mounted carriers had ridden between "posts" where the postmaster would remove the letters for the local area before handing the remaining letters and any additions to the next rider. The riders were frequent targets for robbers, and the system was inefficient.
Because Palmer made much use of stagecoach services between cities in the course of his business, and noted that it seemed far more efficient than the system of mail delivery then in operation, so that he could travel from Bath to London in a single day while the mail took three days. It occurred to him that this coach service could be developed into a national mail delivery service, so in 1782 he suggested to the Post Office in London that they take up the idea. He met resistance from officials who believed that the existing system could not be improved, but eventually the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Pitt, allowed him to carry out an experimental run between Bristol and London. Under the old system the journey had taken up to 38 hours. The coach, funded by Palmer, left Bristol at 4 pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later.
Impressed by the trial run, Pitt authorised the creation of new routes. Within the month the service had been extended from London to Norwich, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester, and by the end of 1785 services to the following major towns and cities of England and Wales had also been linked: Leeds, Dover, Portsmouth, Poole, Exeter, Gloucester, Worcester, Holyhead and Carlisle. A service to Edinburgh was added the next year, and Palmer was rewarded by being made Surveyor and Comptroller General of the Post Office. By 1797 there were forty-two routes.
Post Office employment.
Part of Palmer's argument for the changes had been that such an improvement in the service would justify an increase in postal charges, and he had been promised two-and-a-half percent of any increase in the revenue as well as control of the new service. He was appointed Comptroller General of the Post Office on 11 October 1786, but there was some delay in paying him his share of the very substantial increase in revenue (which had risen from £51,000 in 1784 to £73,000 in 1787). He was eventually granted a payment of arrears after a commission of inquiry investigated in 1789, but not the full sum that he claimed.
Initially the coach, horses and driver were all supplied by contractors. There was strong competition for the contracts because they provided a fixed regular income in addition to which the companies could charge fares for the passengers. By the beginning of the 19th century the Post Office had their own fleet of coaches with black and scarlet livery. The early coaches were poorly built, but in 1787 the Post Office adopted John Besant's improved and patented design, after which Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of coaches, and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing.
As Comptroller General, Palmer was subordinate to the Postmaster General, and although he attempted to reform the operation of the Post Office, he found himself continually at odds with his superior, not least because of his habit of exceeding his legitimate powers without reference to the postmaster.
The development of railways in the 1830s spelt the end for the mail coach service. The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830. By the early 1840s many London-based mail coaches were starting to be withdrawn from service; the final service from London (to Norwich) was shut down in 1846. Regional mail coaches continued into the 1850s, but these too were eventually replaced by rail services.
Later life.
After a series of controversies, he was effectively dismissed in 1792, but the following year Pitt granted him a government pension of £3,000 a year. However, Palmer continued to press his claim for the much greater sum to which he believed he was entitled, and eventually in 1813 (long after Pitt's death) a parliamentary bill was passed to grant him the sum of £50,000.
The institution of mail coaches permanently revolutionised the British postal service, and Palmer was widely honoured for it, being presented with the freedom of numerous towns and cities. In Bath he was particularly cherished, becoming Mayor in 1796 and again in 1809, and sitting as Member of Parliament (MP) for the city from 1801 to 1808. Such was his influence with the Common Council of Bath (which in those days had the exclusive right to vote for the city's MPs) that he was able to stand down from Parliament in 1808 in the knowledge that his son Charles would be elected in his place.
He died at Brighton in 1818, and was buried in the Abbey Church at Bath.

Regina Regina was an American country music duo formed in 1995. The duo consisted of female singers Regina Leigh and Regina Nicks, respectively natives of North Carolina and Houston, Texas. Leigh was formerly a backing vocalist in Reba McEntire's road band, while Nicks was a personal assistant for McEntire and a former member of Dave & Sugar. The two met through the assistance of producer Wally Wilson, who wanted to include Nicks in a female duo. Nicks felt that she was unable to find a suitable singing partner until Leigh heard one of her demos and decided that she wanted to work with Nicks. The two were brought to Giant Records then-president James Stroud in 1995.
Regina Regina released its only album in 1997. The duo's only charting single in the U.S. was "More Than I Wanted to Know", which peaked at No. 53 on "Billboard"s Hot Country Singles & Tracks.

Max Euwe Memorial Tournament

The Max Euwe Memorial Tournament was an annual chess tournament played in honour of Max Euwe (1901–1981) from 1987-1996. It was played mainly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (in 1990 it was played in Rotterdam). The tournament was usually a four-player double round-robin tournament, the 1991 and 1996 edition were ten-player single round-robin tournaments. 
The last edition of the memorial was held in 1996, mainly because the main sponsor Verenigde Spaarbank (VSB) lost its interest.
In 1976, while Euwe was still alive, a Jubilee tournament was held.

United Way Worldwide

United Way Worldwide is the leadership and support organization for the network of nearly 1,800 community-based United Ways in 45 countries and territories. It advances the common good, creating opportunities for a better life for all, by focusing on education, income and health. The United Way movement mobilizes millions to action — to give, advocate and volunteer — to improve the conditions in which they live.
History.
The organization has roots in Denver, Colorado, where in 1887 church leaders began the Charity Organization Society, which coordinated services and fund raising for 22 agencies. Many Community Chest organizations, which were founded in the first half of the twentieth century to jointly collect and allocate money, joined the American Association for Community Organizations in 1918. The first Community Chest was founded in 1913 in Cleveland, Ohio, after the example of the Jewish Federation in Cleveland — which served as an exemplary model for "federated giving". The number of Community Chest organizations increased from 39 to 353 between 1919 and 1929, and surpassed 1,000 by 1948. In 1948, Walter C. Laidlaw merged the Community Chest and other Detroit charities to form the United Foundation. By 1963, and after several name changes, the term United Way was adopted, but not everyone chose to use it. After Walter C. Laidlaw fell ill, William Aramony became CEO of the national governing body which was known as the United Community Funds and Council of America (UCFCA) and in 1970 the organization was renamed United Way of America (UWA), and moved from New York City to Alexandria, Virginia in 1971.
After Aramony's departure in 1992, Kenneth W. Dam was named interim CEO until Elaine Chao was selected as UWA's second President. Betty Stanley Beene took over in 1997 and stayed until 2001. Chris Amundsen, Chief Administrative Officer, served as interim president during a year-long search. Brian Gallagher, former head of United Way in Columbus, Ohio, accepted the job in 2002 and was still president and CEO at the end of 2011.
In the 2007 Philanthropy 400, United Way of America was again the largest charity in the United States, with 1,285 local United Ways reporting over $4.2 billion in contributions, a 2.2% increase over 2006.
In May 2009, United Way of America and United Way International were integrated as one global entity, United Way Worldwide. In May 2009, United Way of America and United Way International were integrated as one global entity, United Way Worldwide.
Global expansion.
In its first 100 years, the United Way network reached 20 countries. Since 1990, United Ways have been created in 25 additional countries. 
United Ways worldwide are uniquely driven by local volunteers and professional leadership. In communities around the world, United Ways convene local leaders to identify needs and create strategies that allow individuals and families to experience economic and human success through educational achievement, income stability and healthy lives. They provide, assist or promote: 
United Way in France.
United Way Tocqueville (UWT) was created in France as a non-profit organization, and a part of the largest private charitable organization in the world, United Way Worldwide. UWT's ambition is to gather together the economic, political and social leaders to initiate collective community efforts to solve social problems.
United Way New Zealand.
United Way New Zealand (UWNZ), officially known as United Way (NZ) Inc., was established in 1975 as the United Way of Greater Auckland. In 1998, the geographic scope of the organization was expanded, and the name was changed to reflect the new national focus.
Response to earthquakes in Chile, Haiti and Japan.
United Way's local organization in Chile, along with other United Way organizations throughout Latin America have mobilized to respond to the earthquake that hit Chile on February 27, 2010. They provided support in areas with the most pressing long-term recovery needs.
In the wake of a natural disaster, United Way's role is to support long-term recovery efforts to rebuild lives and communities affected by a disaster and to address educational, financial and health-related challenges. 
United Way Worldwide established the "United Way Worldwide Disaster Fund", introduced a text-to-give program, and is coordinating the integration of efforts from United Ways around the world. United Way Worldwide has worked with the United States government – the White House, Congress, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and to underscore the vital role of U.S. and international NGOs in Haiti's long-term recovery.
Immediately following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, United Way began raising crucial funds needed for the Central Community Chest of Japan, part of the United Way worldwide network. Almost 90 volunteer centers have been set up throughout the country at the prefectural, municipal, district, and community levels. As of March 22, eight consultants and 23 volunteer coordinators have been dispatched to Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate, and Aomori Prefecture, with another 68 coordinators preparing for dispatch. The Central Community Chest of Japan has helped provide supplies to volunteer centers including: bicycles, mattresses, cell phones, and laptops. Additional supplies requested by the volunteer centers include motorbikes, prefab houses and tents, copy and fax machines, PCs and printers.
The Central Community Chest of Japan is collaborating with 43 affiliated non-profit organizations through the Council for Disaster Relief Project for Volunteers. This number is expected to grow rapidly as transportation conditions continue to improve.

Priscilla Napier

Priscilla Napier (5 October 1908 - 10 October 1998) was an English author, specializing in biography.
Early life.
Born at Oxford in 1908, Hayter was the daughter of Sir William Hayter, an adviser to the Egyptian government, and his wife, Alethea Slessor, daughter of a Hampshire rector. Her brother, Sir William Goodenough Hayter (1906–1995), became British ambassador to the Soviet Union and Warden of New College, Oxford, while her sister Alethea Hayter (1911–2006) was a literary biographer. 
She spent her early years in Cairo, and later wrote of her mother and her aunts that they were "true Victorians: not in a general way frightened of murder and sudden death, but perfectly terrified of insects".
Napier was educated at Downe House School, in Berkshire, which was then under the headship of its founder Olive Willis, and at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she graduated (like her sister Alethea three years later) BA in modern history.
Life.
At the age of twenty-two, Priscilla Hayter married Trevylyan Michael Napier born 21 June 1901 Kensington London, a Royal Navy officer and a scion of the Napier family of Merchiston. A Napier ancestor had arrived in Somerset from Scotland in the reign of Henry VII, and Trevylyan Napier's father, like his grandfather, was a Vice-Admiral. After her husband was killed on active service in 1940, Priscilla Napier was left to bring up their son and two daughters. She then developed a writing career based on studies of her dead husband's family. She also published poetry and an autobiography.

Sixth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly

The sixth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly was held between 10 January – 14 January 1980 to consider the situation in Afghanistan. As the Soviet war in Afghanistan began members of the United Nations General Assembly requested the Security Council consider the situation. The USSR veto of a resolution led the other members to invoke the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution to defer the issue to the General Assembly in an emergency special session. It was the sixth emergency special session since the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution was adopted in 1950. The session was dominated by questions of its legitimacy since the Afghanistan government had invited the Soviet intervention in their civil war. Led by the non-aligned members, the session ended with a resolution from the General Assembly calling for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the cessation of all outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint, of any kind whatsoever, so that its people could freely choose its own economic, political and social systems.
Background.
During the Saur Revolution on April 27, 1978 the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, aided by the Khalq faction of the military, overthrew the government of Republic of Afghanistan and formed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. A significant insurgency formed, led by the Mujahideen, and fought the new government who requested Soviet assistance to fight back. In December, they signed a Treaty of Friendship with the USSR and the Soviets provided military assistance. Meanwhile, the United States began funding and arming the insurgency. On December 17, 1979 President Hafizullah Amin requested Soviet assistance in a major offensive. The Soviets agreed and on 27 December, dressed in Afghan military uniforms, invaded Kabul but overthrew Amin and installed Babrak Karmal as the new president, clearing the way for a large-scale occupation. 
At the UN General Assembly, a letter was sent to the president of the Security Council requesting a Security Council meeting to consider the matter (letter signed jointly by Australia, Bahamas, Belgium, Canada, Chili, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Ecuador, Fiji, German Federal Republic, Greece, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New-Guinea, Philippines, Portugal, Santa Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Suriname, Sweden, The Netherlands, Turkey, UK, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela). The Security Council convened between 5 to 9 January 1980. Afghanistan and the Soviet Union denounced the meeting as interfering with domestic affairs of a Member State and that they were exercising their Treaty of Friendship and their right to collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States claimed the Soviet intervention violated the territorial integrity of Afghanistan and that with the death of President Amin, by Soviet forces, the Afghan government had been overthrown. A draft resolution calling for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops was vetoed by the Soviets on 7 January. Two days later the Security Council adopted Resolution 462 acknowledging the lack of unanimity of its permanent members was preventing them from fulfilling their primary duty of maintaining peace and security, invoking the General Assembly's 'Uniting for Peace' resolution calling for an emergency special session. This was adopted with 12 supports, 2 opposes (USSR and German Democratic Republic), with 1 abstention (Zambia).
Emergency special session.
The sixth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly began on 10 January. The session was dominated by questions of its legitimacy. In a speech, the representative from Afghanistan expressed "the strongest and most categorical objections to the discussion of the so-called question of the situation in Afghanistan. The convening of a special session of the General Assembly on this issue constitutes an open and flagrant interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan." The Soviets also argued that the session was being held in contravention to Charter of the United Nations which respects the internal affairs of member states. Surprisingly, India sided with the Soviets with a speech by Brajesh Mishra on 11 January when he acknowledged that the Soviets provided the assistance that both President Amin and his successor requested, and furthermore, that the Soviets would leave Afghanistan at the request of the Afghanistan government. Pakistan, who had been taking in refugees at its border with Afghanistan, took at particularly harsh stance against the Soviets and called for them to withdraw their forces.
Led by the non-aligned members, the General Assembly adopted Resolution ES-6/2 "strongly deplorthe recent armed intervention in Afghanistan…[and appeals to all States to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan and to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of that country calls for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan in order to enable its people to determine their own form of government and choose their economic, political and social systems free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever..." The resolution also appealed to all states and organizations for humanitarian relief for refugees via the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

<doc id="18516989" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18516989" title="Eastern Maine Railway (1995)">
Eastern Maine Railway (1995)

The Eastern Maine Railway Company Limited is a U.S. short line railroad owned by the New Brunswick Railway Company, a holding company that is part of "Irving Transportation Services", a division within the industrial conglomerate J.D. Irving Limited.
Together with its sister company New Brunswick Southern Railway , EMRY and NBSR form a continuous main line connecting Saint John, New Brunswick with Brownville Junction, Maine in addition to another of branch lines owned and operated by NBSR in Canada. A sister company Maine Northern Railway operates a separate 258-mile railway system connecting Millinocket, Maine with Van Buren, Maine.
History.
EMRY was established as a corporate entity on November 10, 1994 by J.D. Irving Ltd. to purchase the 99.5 mile right of way and physical railway assets of the Canadian Pacific Railway's Mattawamkeag Subdivision rail line within the state of Maine, running from its eastern terminus at the Canada–United States border, this being the midpoint of the Saint Croix-Vanceboro Railway Bridge at Vanceboro, west to Brownville Junction.
Both EMRY and NBSR began operations on January 6, 1995 approximately 1 week after Canadian Pacific Railway abandoned operations of its Canadian Atlantic Railway (CAR) subsidiary on December 31, 1994. In addition to owning the former CPR tracks in Maine, EMRY was an operating entity for the first several months of existence and had running rights over its sister company NBSR's tracks from the International Boundary east to the yard at McAdam, New Brunswick. In spring 1995 Irving Transportation Services consolidated its railway operations as Eastern Maine Railway Company Limited came under NBSR operational control.
Route.
EMRY's corporate trackage is a continuation of the NBSR mainline at the International Boundary in Vanceboro, immediately across the St. Croix River from the hamlet of St. Croix. From Vanceboro, EMRY's trackage runs 105 miles west to Brownville Junction with a connection along the way to Pan Am Railways serving southern New England at Mattawamkeag. EMRY connects with the former Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway at Brownville Junction, which operated part of the north-south former Bangor and Aroostook Railroad trackage in Maine, as well as the continuation of the CPR mainline from Brownville Junction west to Montreal.
The tracks between Vanceboro and Mattawamkeag were built as part of the European and North American Railway which connected Saint John, New Brunswick with Bangor, Maine, opening in 1869. The section west of Mattawamkeag to Brownville Junction was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway as part of its International Railway of Maine subsidiary, opening in 1889 to connect Montreal, Quebec with Saint John; this line made CPR a transcontinental railway system. The E&NA tracks from Bangor to Vanceboro via Mattawamkeag were leased in the 1870s and purchased in the 1950s by the Maine Central Railroad and later purchased in 1974 by CPR.
As a portion of the Bangor and Aroostook line from Millinocket south through Brownville Junction was not part of MM&A's sale of track to the state, EMRY's track is not contiguous to Irving-operated Maine Northern Railway (MNRY). In the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway bankruptcy auction, EMRY had made a joint bid with Pan-Am's Springfield Terminal Railway for the former MM&A trackage in Maine - a move which could have re-unified the Bangor and Aroostook under Irving's banner. An initial Radio-Canada report that this bid was successful was quickly contradicted by other sources (including the English-language Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Canadian Press news wire) which indicate all of the former MM&A rails went to Fortress Investment Group subsidiary Railroad Acquisition Holdings. According to a statement from Wayne Power, vice president of J.D. Irving’s transportation and logistics division, “In the end, the trustee went forward with a single buyer of the entire MMA railway line. We look forward to working with Fortress Investment Group of New York as they assume operation of the MMA railway.”
Operations.
Today most locomotives hauling trains that operate over EMRY are owned and carry the reporting marks of NBSR. Some maintenance of way equipment is owned by EMRY but the majority of the company's assets are the physical tracks and right of way from Vanceboro to Brownville Junction, as well as the running rights in New Brunswick to McAdam.

Mitsubishi 4N1 engine

The Mitsubishi 4N1 engine is a family of all-alloy four-cylinder diesel engines developed by Mitsubishi Motors, produced at the company's powertrain facility in Kyoto, Japan for use in Mitsubishi's small to mid-sized global passenger cars.
In June 2006, Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries announced a joint development project for a new generation of clean diesel engines to be used in cars exported to Europe with a target of beginning mass production in 2010 and later announced that the engines will be gradually phased into other global markets.
The preliminary version of the 1798 cc engine was first seen in the Concept-cX test car introduced in 2007. The larger 2268 cc was first exhibited in the Concept-ZT test car introduced in the same year and later used in the Concept-RA test car introduced in 2008.
With a clean diesel emission performance in mind, all engines are designed to comply with Tier 2 Bin 5 emission regulations in the United States, Euro 5 standard in Europe and Japan's Post New Long Term regulations.
Together with Mitsubishi's electric vehicle technology the new diesel engines are positioned as a core element in the Mitsubishi Motors Environment Initiative Program 2010 (EIP 2010) announced in July 2006.
The 4N1 engine family is the world's first to feature a variable valve timing (intake side) system applied to passenger car diesel engines.
All engines developed within this family have aluminum cylinder block, double overhead camshaft layouts, four valves per cylinder, a common rail injection system with a variable geometry turbocharger and "MIVEC" variable valve timing.
Engine family characteristics.
Mitsubishi's new clean diesel engines use a high-pressure common rail injection system to improve combustion efficiency. The "4N13" 1.8-liter uses solenoid fuel-injectors. The larger "4N14" 2.3-liter engine uses piezo fuel-injectors that produce a finer fuel spray. Both engines feature a fast ceramic glowplug system. The engines are designed to operate at a lower compression ratio, thus lowering the combustion pressure, allowing the use of an aluminium cylinder block that reduces weight.
The "4N13" 1.8-liter engine uses a Variable Geometry (VG) turbocharger with a variable vane turbine, which provides optimal boost pressure control for different driving conditions. The "4N14" 2.3-liter engine also uses a VG turbocharger plus a Variable Diffuser (VD) that uses both variable geometry vanes in the turbine housing and a compressor with variable vanes in the diffuser passage, further improving combustion efficiency.
Within the engine, Mitsubishi used an offset angle crankshaft that reduces friction, therefore noise and vibration, allowing the engine to run smoothly and quietly at all engine speeds.
To meet the requirements of global emissions standards, Mitsubishi developed a new catalyst system that combines a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), NOx Trap Catalyst (NTC) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF).

Remz of "Country Standard Time" gave the album a negative review, saying that it "mine the generic, overproduced field of bland pop country." A reviewer for "The Technique", the student newspaper for the Georgia Institute of Technology, gave the album a more positive review, noting that the two singers seemed to focus more on harmonies than most other country groups. The album's first single, "If I Had a Nickel (One Thin Dime)" reached No. 65 on the country charts, while the second single, "Squeezin' the Love Outta You", peaked at No. 74. The latter was also recorded by Carolyn Dawn Johnson (who co-wrote it) on her 2004 album "Dress Rehearsal".

Madre Teresa Nuzzo

Maria Teresa Nuzzo (11 May 1851, Valletta, Malta – 17 April 1923) was a Roman Catholic nun, founder of the religious institute Daughters of the Sacred Heart.
Early life.
Maria Teresa was born into a strongly Christian family, the second child born to Paul Nuzzo and Louisa Morrocchi. Her elder brother died in a cholera outbreak, leaving Maria Teresa the eldest. A day after Maria Teresa was born, she was baptised in the Collegiate Parish of St. Paul, and she received confirmation at the age of eight.
In Maria Teresa's early years, education was not compulsory in Malta. Few could afford to send their children to school: most children worked to earn money to help their families. However, Maria Teresa was fortunate enough to education. Talented in handiwork and music, she developed an early interest in children and their welfare. In 1867, aged sixteen, Maria Teresa became responsible for a school run by her aunt, who had become blind and who died on 4 March 1867.
Although Maria Teresa began to feel a desire to embrace religious life, she felt responsibility for her parents – her father was seventy and ailing – and for the school under her care. At the age of 21 she considered the possibility of taking private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience as a lay person.
Private vows.
Maria Teresa consulted her spiritual director, Mgr. Pietro Pace who encouraged her to take her vows on the feast of St. Teresa of Avila. Maria Theresa still felt torn: though inclined to religious life, she was unsure whether she would ultimately leave her family. On 21 October 1874, she made her vows privately in the hands of Mgr. Pietro Pace. Two years later, when she was still only twenty-five, her father died.
Maria Teresa continued to feel attracted to enter a convent, and moreover to join the cloistered nuns. In 1880, she brought this to the attention of her Spiritual Director, who told her outright: "You are not suited for the cloister". So her life continued to revolve around the school, and catechetical and pastoral care after school hours. A year later in 1881 her mother died.
The Daughters of the sacred heart.
Maria Theresa began to hope to set up a religious congregation who would follow Christ closely and be dedicated to the charitable service of education and social work. Despite lack of finance, Maria Theresa trusted in God's providence, and after a long struggle, managed to see the realisation of her dreams in 1902.
A cousin, Enrico Nuzzo, shared the same ideal: to help educate the unfortunate in society, especially girls. In his mid-life, the latter desired to use his money for a social project to realise his ideals. When the two met, Enrico told Maria Teresa of his dream. She expressed the desire of accepting the offer and her desire to form a Religious Institute. This was passed on to the Archbishop to whom Enrico had entrusted the plot with a house for the project. The Archbishop knew Maria Teresa well, and was happy to see her hopes and dreams actualised.
In 1902, the building started and in 1903, Maria Teresa - now aged 52 - started living in that house with the first members of her new foundation. Thus at the age of 52 years, Maria Teresa managed to set up the congregation she had dreamt of. The Congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart was officially founded on 21 November 1903, the Founding day respected by every Daughter of the Sacred Heart.
Today.
Today, the Daughters of the Sacred Heart are in Malta, India, Libya, Kenya, Tanzania, Philippines and United States of America.

This article presents the demographic history of Romania through census results. See Demographics of Romania for a more detailed overview of the country's present-day demographics.
The 1930 census was the only one to cover Greater Romania. Censuses in 1948, 1956, 1966, 1977, 1992, 2002 and 2011 covered Romania's present-day territory. All but the 1948 census, which asked about mother tongue, had a question on ethnicity. Moldavia and Wallachia each held a census in 1859. The Romanian Old Kingdom conducted statistical estimates in 1884, 1889 and 1894, and held censuses in 1899 and 1912. Ion Antonescu's regime also held two: a general one in April 1941, and one for those with "Jewish blood" in May 1942.

Go (Scott Fitzgerald song)

"Go", written and composed by Julie Forsyth, who was a member of the Pop Group Guys 'n' Dolls and is the daughter of English entertainer Bruce Forsyth, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1988, performed by Scott Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald won the right to perform at Dublin by winning the UK national final, "A Song for Europe", where he was the eighth singer to perform. Fitzgerald was also the first singer to be chosen to represent the United Kingdom via a national telephone vote. In Dublin, the song was performed fourth on the night, after Finland's Boulevard with "Nauravat silmät muistetaan", and before Turkey's Mazhar-Fuat-Özkan with "Sufi." 
At the end of judging that evening, "Go" took the second-place slot with 136 points. Turkey, Belgium and Italy awarded their 12 point designations to the UK that evening. In one of the closest voting rounds up to that time, the UK lost the competition by one point to Switzerland's representative, Canadian singer Celine Dion, with her song "Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi." According to author and contest historian John Kennedy O'Connor, this was the closest contest yet, with the winning margin being just 0.73%. The strong showing in the 1988 contest was an indicator of things to come for the United Kingdom, as it would become the first of eleven straight Top Ten placings in the Contest, and the first of four second-place finishes in the next six years.
In a departure from the past two years, an easy listening ballad was on offer this year, telling the story of two former lovers meeting by chance. Fitzgerald, in the role of the lovesick man, relates the sad story; his former lover had left him years before for another man, and now that she has returned, so has all the sorrow he felt.
After the Eurovision, the song placed at #52 on the UK Singles Chart.

"Baby I'm-a Want You" is a popular song by the American pop-rock band Bread. The single was released in October 1971 (see 1971 in music). It became the title track for the album of the same name, released in January 1972. 
It was one of Bread's highest-charting singles in both the U.S. and U.K. In the U.S., it reached #3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in December 1971, the third of Bread's four top-five hits ("Make It with You", #1 in 1970; "If", #4 earlier in 1971; and "Everything I Own", from the same album, #5 in 1972). "Baby I'm-a Want You" reached the top of the easy listening chart and rose to #14 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1972. 
It was certified as a gold record by the RIAA. As with virtually all of the band's well-known recordings, the song was both written and produced by the band's lead vocalist, David Gates.

Theophane was a daughter of Bisaltes, who, in consequence of her extraordinary beauty, was beleaguered by lovers, but was carried off by Poseidon to the isle of Crinissa. As the lovers followed her even there, Poseidon metamorphosed the maiden into a sheep and himself into a ram, and all the inhabitants of the island into animals. As the lovers began to slaughter these animals, he changed them into wolves. The god then became by Theophane the father of the ram with the golden fleece, which carried Phrixus to Colchis.

Cry Baby (Jemini song)

"Cry Baby", written and composed by Martin Isherwood, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, and was performed by the duo Jemini. To date, it is the only song ever entered by the United Kingdom to earn no points from any other countries.
Selection process.
Jemini were selected to take part in Eurovision by a public phone poll in the BBC's "A Song for Europe" competition. However, given the novel voting procedure used in the selection that year, some people questioned whether they really were the popular choice in any meaningful sense, a question which obviously loomed larger after the outcome in Latvia. The new system was essentially a synthesis of the familiar popular vote, and the points system that had existed before telephone voting was first deemed feasible in 1988. Votes were tallied separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and three regions of England (North, South and the Midlands), and were then converted into points. What to many seemed the unsatisfactory nature of this arrangement was exacerbated by the fact that, due to a clash with football coverage, the competition was only televised in Scotland on minority channel BBC Two, leading to the possibility of a very low number of votes from there. However, this was not the case, with over 100,000 votes cast in total for the duo.
Eurovision performance.
For their Eurovision appearance, Chris Cromby and Gemma Abbey were accompanied on stage by three female backing singers, and a guitarist named Kirk. The song was a simple pop ditty about a woman telling her lover that their relationship is over.
The Eurovision failure prompted a great deal of mirth and consternation in the British and European media. Jemini admitted that their performance was off-key, and claimed they were unable to hear the backing track due to a technical fault. Chris claimed that Terry Wogan had before the contest warned them that they would not get any points due to the Iraq War. although the majority of the media blamed the result on the poor quality of the song and that it was sung out of tune with Louis Walsh branding the song 'a disgrace' and 'so out of tune they deserved to be last'. Following the show their dressing room was broken into and vandalised. Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in "The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History" that with a record field of 26 entries, this made the UK's failure the most spectacular in the history of the contest.
The exposure the duo received after the contest gave them a No. 15 hit in the UK Singles Chart with the single "Cry Baby".

Though, as of July 2008, the Court continues to exist, it has largely been replaced by a new judicial regime under the Competition Act 1998 and Enterprise Act 2002 and will be disestablished in due course.

Eunectes

Eunectes is a genus of boas found in tropical South America. They are an aquatic group of snakes and include one of the largest snakes in the world, "E. murinus", the green anaconda. The name "Eunectes" is derived from the Greek word Eυνήκτης, which means "good swimmer". Four species are currently recognized.
Geographic range.
Found in tropical South America from Colombia and Venezuela south to Argentina.
Feeding.
All four species are aquatic snakes that prey on other aquatic animals, including fish, river fowl, caiman, and capybaras. Some accounts exist of anacondas preying on domestic animals such as goats that venture too close to the water.
Relationship with humans.
While encounters between people and anacondas may be dangerous, they do not regularly hunt humans. Nevertheless, threat from anacondas is a familiar trope in comics, movies and adventure stories set in the Amazon jungle. Anacondas have also figured prominently in South American folklore, where they are sometimes depicted as shapeshifting mythical creatures called encantados. Local communities and some European explorers have given accounts of giant anacondas, legendary snakes of much greater proportion than any confirmed specimen.
Although charismatic, there is little known on the biology of wild anacondas. Most of our knowledge comes from the work of Dr. Jesus Rivas and his team working in the Venezuelan llanos.

The Broads Society is a waterway society in Norfolk and Suffolk, England, UK.
The society was founded in 1956 to provide a focus for anyone interested in the region, e.g. navigators, naturalists, farmers, residents and visitors. It campaigned in the 1960s and 1970s for special status for The Broads, and in 1988 the area was given special protection, a status similar to that of a National Park after the passing of the Norfolk & Suffolk Broads Act 1988.
Today the Broads Society has a membership of about 1200, and it monitors pressures on the unique Broads environment, as well as commenting on planning applications. It is represented on the Broads Authority's Broads Forum.
The Broads Society became a joint owner of the eel sett at Candle Dyke which is the last working sett in the East of England.
The Society's volunteers are known as "Broadsword"; they work during the winter months clearing trees and scrub from river banks. This encourages the re-colonisation of banks by reedswamp and helps maintains the unique environment found in Broadland. It also improves sailing conditions.
The Mission Statement of the Broads Society:
"Our members share a common purpose to help secure a sustainable future for The Broads as a unique and protected landscape in which leisure, tourism and the local economy can thrive in harmony with the natural environment".

K Puppis

k Puppis (k Pup, k Puppis) is a Bayer designation given to an optical double star in the constellation Puppis, the two components being k1 Puppis and k2 Puppis. Note that the designation here is "k" not "kappa" (κ) as some astronomers teach. Many of Puppis' stellar designations are English labels. This pair of stars is given the traditional Arabic name Markeb or Markab.
Both k1 Puppis and k2 Puppis are bright blue B-type giant stars of nearly equal brightness, +4.50 and +4.62, respectively. To the naked eye, the pair has a combined magnitude of +3.80. On the sky, the two stars are separated by approximately 9.9 seconds of arc along PA 318º. The optical pair can be distinguished easily with a small telescope. The component k1 Puppis is a binary star system in its own right, while k2 Puppis is a variable star. Each star within the k Puppis optical pair is between 450 and 470 light years from Earth.

The West River, in the US state of Massachusetts, is a tributary of the Blackstone River.
Course.
It originates in the towns of Grafton and Upton, Massachusetts, near the Upton State Forest, at Silver Lake and Cider Mill Pond in Grafton, and crosses into the eastern portion of Northbridge, passes through the eastern portion of Uxbridge where the West Hill Dam provides flood control, and enters into the Blackstone River south of Uxbridge and Wheelockville before the Blackstone enters the state of Rhode Island.
A wildlife preserve with fishing, hiking and recreation trails are found at a federal recreation area created at the West Hill Dam. The West River Reservoir is well known for fishing.
History.
The West River provided water power at the outset of the American Industrial Revolution, providing power to a textile mill founded by Luke Taft in 1825, which later became the site of the Waucantuck Mill Complex where "wash and wear" fabrics originated. About 1810 Taft's father-in-law, Daniel Day, started an early wool-carding mill where the West River joins the Blackstone River. The Daniel Day woolen mill was one of the first US woolen mills. The Blackstone River Valley is a U.S. National Heritage Area and a major contributing region to America's Industrial Revolution.

LIVERight

LIVERight is the first 5K run/walk to raise awareness about hepatitis B and liver cancer.
The goal of LIVERight was not only to raise money for outreach efforts, but more importantly to educate and increase awareness of this pressing public health issue. Educational displays, informational booths and of course signs were unique and significant components to the event. The education allowed participants to learn more about hepatitis B prevention and treatment, as well as hear the real stories about the lives lost and won to liver cancer.
About LIVERight.
The LIVERight concept began at the 2nd annual Youth Leadership Conference on Asian and Pacific Islander Health in 2004, a CDC funded event organized by the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University. High school students were given a Team Challenge to create a campaign/event for raising awareness about hepatitis B, and LIVERight was born. The words "Liver" and "Right" together emphasize the importance of liver health. From this concept, LIVERight bracelets and the LIVERight 5K run/walk emerged.
Adrian Elkins inspired the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University to start LIVERight, a 5K Run/Walk to raise awareness about hepatitis B and liver cancer in the Asian Pacific Islander community.
On 30 April 2005 in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the Asian Liver Center and the Answer to Cancer Foundation hosted LIVERight.
On 11 November 2006, the 2nd annual LIVERight on the go! was held at Stanford's Sand Hill Fields. The community event had 700 registered participants and 100 volunteers, and raised over $135,000.
LIVERight '09 was held on Saturday, May 2, 2009 at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Over 400 runners registered and raised over $100,000 to fight liver cancer and hepatitis B.
In November 2010, LIVERight returns to Stanford University with the hottest new dance fitness craze that's taking over the world. Fusing hypnotic Latin rhythms with easy to follow dance moves, Zumba Fitness is a Latin-inspired cardio dance fitness workout. The LIVERight Zumbathon at Stanford will be held on Saturday, November 13, 2010 in partnership with the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, Answer to Cancer, Be Well @ Stanford and the Stanford Department of Physical Education. Zumba is all about having fun and no experience is necessary. This family-friendly event is open to the public and all of the Stanford community. As in the past, donations benefit the Jade Ribbon Campaign and the fight against liver cancer. Enthusiastic Zumba Fitness Instructors, prizes and games, and two hours of Latin rhythms will keep participants sweating and having fun.
Answer to Cancer.
The Answer to Cancer (A2C) run was founded by Adrian Elkins, a 20-year-old student at Southern Oregon University who was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2002. Had he known during his childhood that his ethnicity and chronic hepatitis B infection increased his chance of developing liver cancer by 100%, he would have been regularly monitored for liver damage. He had no idea that hepatitis B—a disease he contracted at birth in Calcutta, India—causes 80% of the world's liver cancer cases. Adrian battled his disease for ten months, working tirelessly to organize an event to raise money for liver cancer research. Adrian saw the first-ever A2C run take place on 8 August 2003. Thanks to the generous support of friends, families and numerous companies, the 2003 Answer to Cancer Race was able to raise more than $20,000 for three charities and reach out to more than 240 participants. Adrian died only eight days after this first race.

Surrounding suburbs of Yatala include Beenleigh, Windaroo, and Stapylton. Yatala and adjoining suburbs are located near the confluence of the Albert River, which is at the northern end of the suburb.
Etymology.
The name "Yatala" derives from an Aboriginal place name near Pooraka in South Australia. A property on the Albert River was acquired by a South Australian who named the property after the South Australian place. The word is from the Weira group of the Kaurna Aboriginal people, meaning "water running by the side of a river". "See: Yatala Vale, South Australia, District Council of Yatala"
History.
Since 2006 development has been rapidly occurring within the suburb, with over 300 businesses now established within its boundaries. This type of urban development is predicted to eventually encompass all the semi-rural land currently separating the Brisbane Metropolitan Area and Gold Coast City. Currently, there is approximately 6 km of this land remaining between the two cities.
Culture.
Yatala is home to the Yatala Pies shop which claims to have been "a landmark in the Yatala area" for "more than 130 years" . The restaurant is considered a common stop-over for travellers between Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
There are no permanent public libraries in the vicinity of Yatala (Yatala residents are ineligible to use the nearby Beenleigh public library as it is operated by the Logan City Council), however the Gold Coast City Council operates a mobile library which regularly visits the nearby suburb of Ormeau.
Transport.
Yatala is linked to both the Beenleigh railway station and the Ormeau railway station by bus routes 728 and 729, operated by Surfside Buslines on behalf of Translink.

The Valachi Papers (book)

The Valachi Papers is a biography written by Peter Maas, telling the true story of former mafia member Joe Valachi, a low-ranking member of the New York based Genovese crime family, who was the first ever government witness coming from the American Mafia itself. His account of his criminal past revealed many previously unknown details of the Mafia. The book was made into a film ("The Valachi Papers"), released in 1972, starring Charles Bronson as Valachi.
In October 1963, Valachi testified before Senator John L. McClellan's congressional committee on organized crime, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations. In the so-called Valachi hearings he gave the American public a firsthand account of Mafia activities in the United States.
In 1964 the US Department of Justice urged Valachi to write down his personal history of his underworld career. Although Valachi was only expected to fill in the gaps in his formal questioning, the resulting account of his thirty-year criminal career was a rambling 1,180-page manuscript titled "The Real Thing".
Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach authorized the public release of Valachi’s manuscript. He hoped that publication of Valachi’s story would aid law enforcement and possibly encourage other criminal informers to step forward. Author Peter Maas, who broke Valachi’s story in "The Saturday Evening Post", was assigned the job of editing the manuscript and permitted to interview Valachi in his Washington, D.C., jail cell.
The American Italian Anti-Defamation League promoted a national campaign against the book on the grounds that it would reinforce negative ethnic stereotypes. If the book’s publication was not stopped they would appeal directly to the White House. Katzenbach reversed his decision to publish the book after a meeting with President Lyndon B. Johnson; an action that embarrassed the Justice Department.
In May 1966, Katzenbach asked a district court to stop Maas from publishing the book—the first time that a U.S. attorney general had ever tried to ban a book. Maas was never permitted to publish his edition of Valachi’s original memoirs, but he was allowed to publish a third-person account based upon interviews he himself had conducted with Valachi. These formed the basis of the book The Valachi Papers, which was published in 1968 by Putnam.

Fort Phoenix

Fort Phoenix is an American Revolutionary War-era fort located at the entrance to the Fairhaven-New Bedford harbor, south of U.S. 6 in Fort Phoenix Park in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.
On September 5–6, 1778, Fort Phoenix was destroyed by the British when they were raiding the harbor. When it was rebuilt, it was given the name "Fort Phoenix" after the mythical bird that rose from its owns ashes.
The British tried to seize Fort Phoenix in 1814, but they were scared off when they mistook the horn of a postman's bicycle as a sounding of charge.
The fort currently has five iron cannons mounted on reproduction wooden carriages. The cannons are Model 1919 24-pounders and were all made in the 1820s. 
There is also a smaller cannon at the fort which was captured by the Continental Marines during the raid on Nassau in the Bahamas in 1776. This raid was the first amphibious landing on foreign soil by United States Marines. 
The fort was originally built in 1775 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

<doc id="18517640" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18517640" title="Thakins">
Thakins

The Thakins ( "sa.hkang", ; also spelled Thakhin) were a Burmese nationalist group formed around the 1930s and composed of young, disgruntled intellectuals. Drawing their name from the way in which the British were addressed during colonial times, thakin means "lord" or "master", just as the Indians called the British "sahib". The party, however, is formally known as the Dobama Asiayone Movement (which can be translated into either "We Burmans" or "Our Burma"). Established by Ba Thoung in May 1930, it was able to combine tradition with modernity by bringing together traditionalist Buddhist nationalist elements and fresh political ideals. It was significant in stirring up political consciousness in Burma, and drew most of its support base from students.
History.
The group was established in 1930 in Rangoon, after Indian dock workers and their families were murdered by Burman dock workers who believed that the Indians had taken jobs that rightfully belonged to them. The organisation was nationalist in nature, and supported Burman supremacy. Its members used "thakin", literally "master" as their titles. The slogan of the organisation was "Burma is our country; Burmese literature is our literature; Burmese language is our language. Love our country, raise the standards of our literature, respect our language." Dobama Asiayone was keen assimilating ethnic minorities into Burman culture, and most of its activities stemmed from Rangoon University.
By the late 1930s, the Thakins had risen through the ranks to emerge as a prominent nationalist group. To achieve its objectives, the group committed itself to the use violent means, such as strikes and force. In 1937, a Thakin leader had surfaced- a young lawyer by the name of Aung San. In 1939, the Thakins took over the Dobama Asiayone and brought about the collapse of the government of Ba Maw, then the premier of the country, and in 1940, the Thakins and Ba Maw combined forces in the anti-war Freedom Bloc.
Achievements.
The Thakins were credited for the formation of the Burma Independence Army (BIA). In 1940, a Japanese Army Officer, Colonel Suzuki Keiji, took thirty Thakins (including Aung San) for military training in Japanese schools situated in Formosa and Hainan Island. These thirty Thakins were the founding members of the Burma Independence Army, which would later number around 8000 men. When the Japanese invaded Burma in late 1941 and early 1942, the BIA marched with the Japanese to expel the British. On 1 August 1943, the Japanese granted Burma independence, of sorts. The BIA was renamed the Burma National Army (BNA). Recognising that the Japanese had merely replaced the British rather than providing the independence they sought, in March 1945 the BNA turned on the Japanese as the British XIV Army advanced on Rangoon. 
The party's song, Myanmar Kaba Ma Kyei ("Till The End of the World, Myanmar") also became the country's first national song and eventually its national anthem. Composed by Saya Tin (later known as Thakin Tin), the song was a national symbol during the Japanese Occupation of Burma and was adopted in 1948 upon the achievement of independence.

The Boy Next Door (novel)

The Boy Next Door is a novel written by Meg Cabot. The book was published in 2002. It is written with an e-mail format throughout the book.
Plot.
The main character in this novel is Melissa Fuller, but "You can call me Mel", as she says. Mel is a gossip columnist for the "New York Journal" and has just broken up with her longtime boyfriend, Aaron Spender. Her best friend, Nadine Wilcock, a food critic, is getting married to her boyfriend, Tony Salerno, who is a chef at the popular restaurant Fresche. Melissa also has many coworkers, including Dolly Vargas, an outlandish Style Editor who has her eyes on quite a few men.
The book starts with Melissa being late to work after finding her neighbour, Mrs. Helen Friedlander, facedown on the carpet of her apartment after a brutal attack. Mel gets her to the hospital but has yet to solve the problem of walking Paco, Mrs. Friedlander's Great Dane. She calls upon Mrs. Friedlander's nephew, Max Friedlander, to come and take care of Paco and the two cats Tweedledum and Mr. Peepers. Max, who is on vacation with the supermodel Vivica, calls upon his millionaire friend John Trent, who is a crime reporter for the "New York Chronicle", the "Journal"'s top competitor. John impersonates Max and moves into Max's Aunt Helen's apartment.
John and Melissa get off to a good start after sharing mutual affections for not only each other, but other things as well. They go on a date but are stopped by Tweedledum's hospitalization. Afterwards, John kisses Mel over Chinese food, and gets mixed reactions from her as she jumps off to her apartment.
John is troubled over whether he should sleep with Mel. He asks for advice from his family, including his grandmother, Genevieve Randolph Trent, his rich brother Jason Trent, and his sister-in-law, Stacy Trent. They each feel that he should go for it. He does, in fact, take Mel out for dinner and afterward, they have sex. They express their love for each other.
Max's ex-girlfriend, Vivica the supermodel, later spoils their love by telling Mel the big secret. Mel lashes out at John and they split up.
Meanwhile, Max replaces John in the apartment and takes over the pet jobs. It is expressed that he is interested in the thought of insulin injection killing his aunt (his aunt would bequeath him $12 million upon her death), which worries Mel and prompts her to forgive John and ask him for his help in saving Max's aunt. They wire John and catch Max with a murder intent. 
The book ends with John proposing to Mel, and she agreeing to marry him.

Rafi al-Issawi

Rafi Hiyad al-Issawi (born 2 March 1966) is an Iraqi politician who is a former finance minister and deputy prime minister. A doctor by profession, he is the fourth most senior politician from the Sunni Arab minority after former Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlak and Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Usama al-Nujayfi.
Early life and education.
Issawi was born in in Anbar in 1966. He comes from the Albu Issa tribe. This tribe is the dominant tribe in an area of around 80 square kilometers south of the city of Fallujah, in the western province of Al-Anbar.
He trained as an orthopedic surgeon in Baghdad and Basra, before becoming the head of the Fallujah hospital. He was in that role during the Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004 and he reported that 800 local Iraqis had died as a result of the attack. He accused the United States Army of blocking a team of eleven Iraqi ministry of health ambulances with 20 doctors from evacuating the dead and injured or helping the injured. A few months earlier he had accused the US Army of ""constantly attacking ambulances"", saying that an ambulance driver had been killed in a September 2004 bombing aimed at the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
Political career.
Following the December 2005 election and six months of negotiations, a "government of national unity" was agreed between the four main coalitions, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Issawi, a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party which was part of the main Sunni Arab Iraqi Accordance Front colaition, became minister of state for foreign affairs from 20 May 2006. He withdrew from the government with four other ministers from the Front on 1 August 2007, demanding that the government of Nouri al-Maliki take stronger action against Shi'ite militias. The Front rejoined the government on 19 July 2008 and Issawi was approved as deputy prime minister.
Prior to the 2010 elections, he formed his own party, the National Future Gathering, which joined the Iraqiyya coalition. He became the Finance Minister in the Al Maliki II Government which was formed on 22 December 2010 after nine months of negotiations.
In December 2011, he started a boycott the cabinet, along with all but four of the other Iraqiyya ministers. An adviser to the Prime Minister said Issawi had been linked to al Qaeda in Iraq, although the Americans in 2010 had said that a thorough investigation of these allegations had determined that they were groundless. Issawi called for the resignation of Prime Minister Maliki, following the issuance of an arrest warrant for Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, saying Maliki was trying to ""build a dictatorship"".
Attacks.
On 1 January 2012, Issawi was attacked by an improvised explosive device whilst driving. The attack wounded two of his security guards and was described as an "attempted assassination". On 19 December 2012, he reported that nearly 150 of his guards and staff members had been arrested. He was also attacked on 13 January 2013. A bomb was detonated near to his convoy. Issawi was not hurt in attack that occurred while his convoy was heading to Fallujah to meet with tribal leaders.

Moving Mountains (band)

Moving Mountains is a rock band from Purchase, New York. Combining emotional vocals with elements of post-rock, the band has often been compared to such acts as The Appleseed Cast and Thrice.
Moving Mountains was formed in Westchester, New York in 2005 by Gregory Dunn (guitar/vocals) and Nicholas Pizzolato (drums). A self-titled demo was leaked to the public in early 2006 and their debut album "Pneuma" was released independently in early 2007. Later that year, Frank Graniero (guitar/vocals) and Mitchell Lee (bass) completed the band’s line-up. In 2008, "Pneuma" was reissued by Deep Elm Records. After much delay, a new EP entitled "Foreword" was released on December 11, 2008. Their second full-length album "Waves" was released May 10, 2011 on Triple Crown Records. Their self-titled third full-length album "Moving Mountains" was released on September 10, 2013 on Triple Crown Records.
Music.
An excerpt from their Myspace.com profile explains how they approach their musical endeavors: "For some bands, there is a core vision and purpose that shines through from beginning to the end. For others, there is an evolution of an idea, a constant metamorphosis whose end and scope is unknown. For Moving Mountains, the evolution not only encapsulates their music, but a larger overarching concept of what defines ‘Moving Mountains’. That isn’t to say that the Purchase, NY quartet have an artier than thou complex, but it does touch on an evolving aesthetic undercurrent and a belief that a band can create an experiential vision that goes beyond music."
Their musical style is reminiscent of The Appleseed Cast.
Their influences include Hammock and The Album Leaf.
Moving Mountains tracks “Aphelion,” “Fourth,” and “8105” have been used on MTV’s College Life, 16 and Pregnant, and Teen Mom.
“Aphelion” has been used for a trailer for AMC’s television drama series Mad Men.
Formation and Pneuma (2005-2009).
Their self-released album, "Pneuma", was written by Gregory Dunn while he was still in high school. His lyrical inspiration was the death of his friend. 
The track titled "8105" represents the date August 1, 2005 when the band was officially formed by both Gregory Dunn and Nicholas Pizzolato. 
Waves (2010-present).
"Waves" is Moving Mountains' second full-length album. Drifting from the sounds of Pneuma and Foreword, Moving Mountains wanted to create an album that would reflect how they play live. "Waves" was also released on Triple Crown Records, the bands new label. Moving Mountains has stated that Triple Crown Records let them record and write the album however they wanted to.
The lyrics were written by Gregory Dunn, some of which, like Pneuma, were again written about his friend that had died. He has stated that this is the last album with lyrics about his deceased friend.
On September 1, 2011, they announced the following:
"We wanted to loop everyone in on some recent MovMou news and goings on. We're all resting at our respective homes across New York and getting used to post-Warped life, but we'll be regrouping this week to begin rehearsing for our fall tour with Thrice, La Dispute and o'brother. This is a tour we're insanely excited to be a part of! We can't wait to get back to some of the places we missed on our spring tour with Biffy Clyro. Once we get our practice space set up, we'll probably begin broadcasting our rehearsals via Ustream like we used too. Unfortunately, our long-time guitarist Frank Graniero will not be touring with us for the remainder of the year. He'll be returning to school this fall as a full time student and focusing on his project Caravela. We wish him the best of luck and encourage all of you to support Caravela by spreading the word and attending any shows near you. 
Hope all is well. We're looking forward to seeing you all this fall." -MovMou"
At that point, Josh Kirby, their tour manager, took over the guitar and back up vocals role.
On February 7, 2012 they announced that they will be releasing a new EP entitled 'New Light', which is acoustic re-interpretations of two songs off Pneuma and two songs off Waves. The EP was released on April 24, 2012.
On July 9, 2012, the band announced via Facebook that they have started writing and demoing their next full length album. On July 23, 2013 it was announced the album will be self-titled and released on September 10, 2013.
On September 16th through their facebook page, moving mountains announced they will be playing 3 shows with Cavella, This Old Ghost, and Field Mouse, also saying
""These will likely to be the last Moving Mountains shows for the foreseeable future. Over the years, we've been insanely fortunate enough to have the support of such a tight knit fanbase, and we can't thank you enough for providing an outlet for the music we've created. We're all planning to pursue other artistic endeavors and look forward to sharing those with you. Thank you for sharing our music, and sharing this entire experience with us. See you this fall.""
Announcing a indefinite hiatus
Touring.
Moving Mountains has toured extensively since releasing Pneuma, including runs with such bands as Thursday, The Fall of Troy, Straylight Run, Brian Bonz, Say Anything, Moneen, Eisley, Pompeii, All The Day Holiday, The Dear Hunter, Prawn, and Polar Bear Club.
Moving Mountains performed at Bamboozle, on May 2, 2010.
On November 3, 2010 they were announced as support for Scottish band Biffy Clyro on a tour of North America.
Moving Mountains were announced to play every date of the 2011 Vans Warped tour from 
June 24, 2011 in Dallas TX, through to August 14, 2011 in Hillsboro, OR.
Moving Mountains was announced as support for Thrice on their tour for Major/Minor, along with La Dispute and O'Brother.
Moving Mountains accompanied prog band Coheed and Cambria and screamo/post-hardcore band Pianos Become the Teeth on a short US tour in the spring of 2012.

She graduated from Universite de Paris VI, Pierre and Marie Curie University.
She is distinguished for her work on development in insects. Her first major discovery was that pattern formation and growth are regulated by the same mechanism. By a study of genetic mosaics she demonstrated that cells develop into particular structures by means of local interactions with their neighbours. 
She has made major contributions to the understanding of the process of lateral inhibition, whereby initially equivalent cells interact between themselves and subsequently adopt different fates. 
This process involves a conserved cellular receptor and is equally important in mammals; the work can be related to studies on human development and disease.

Life and work.
Education.
Donald was educated at Camden School for Girls and Girton College, Cambridge. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Science (Theoretical Physics) followed by a PhD in 1977.
Work.
Donald worked at Cornell University as a postdoctoral associate, before returning to Cambridge in 1981 and to the Cavendish Laboratory in 1983. She became Professor of Experimental Physics in 1998. Her major domain of study is soft matter physics, particularly its applications to living organisms and the relationship between structure and other properties. Her research has applied microscopy, and in particular Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy to the study of both synthetic and biological systems, notably protein aggregation.
In 1999 Donald was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Her nomination reads 
Athene Donald is distinguished for her work relating mechanical properties to the structure of polymers. She showed that polymer crazing could not be understood without reference to the entanglement network, and showed that two processes are involved, chain scission and chain disentanglement, depending differently on temperature and molecular weight. This work underpins the understanding of brittleness and ductility in solid polymers. She pioneered studies of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers via transmission electron microscopy, revealing the ubiquity of banded textures after shear flow in these materials. More recently, she has developed X-ray methods for characterising starch, thereby opening up the field to novel physical methods which enhance those of the plant biologists and food scientists.
Donald was a fellow of Robinson College, Cambridge, director of WiSETI, the University's Women in Science, Engineering and Technology Initiative, and the University's Gender Equality Champion. Outside the university, she chairs the Athena forum, an organisation which aims to provide a strategic oversight of developments that seek to, or have proven to, advance the career progression and representation of women in science, technology, mathematics, and medicine (STEM) in UK higher education. She is also a member of the ESPCI ParisTech Scientific Committee and was the first director of the Physics of Medicine Initiative. She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, and was appointed a Trustee of the National Museum of Science in Industry in 2011.

Hardwick Village Historic District is a historic district on Petersham, Barre, Greenwich, Ruggles Hill and Gilbertville Roads in Hardwick, Massachusetts. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
The town of Hardwick was incorporated in January 1739 after a group of settlers from Roxbury purchased land from the local Nipmuc Indians. The town was named in honor of Lord Hardwicke, an English nobleman, and became very prosperous before the American Revolutionary War. In 762, one of its most prominent citizens, General Timothy Ruggles, established an annual market fair, a tradition that continues in the Hardwick Community Fair.
Water from its many nearby streams powered saw and grist mills, making the area an early source of manufactured goods as well as agricultural products. The growth of railroads during the 1800s also boosted the local economy by permitting those goods to be transported to larger markets.

Gilbertville Historic District

Gilbertville Historic District is a historic district roughly on Main, Church, High, North, Broad and Bridge Streets Gilbertville, Massachusetts within Hardwick, Massachusetts. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The nearby Ware-Hardwick Covered Bridge is also on the National Register of Historic Places.
The village of Gilbertville grew up around a wool textile mill on the Ware River founded in the 1860s by George H. Gilbert, who already had wool factories in nearby Ware. His Gilbert Manufacturing Company built a Congregational church and a library for his workers, and also helped build the local high school. As many Catholic immigrants came to work in the mills, St. Aloysius Church was established to serve them. The wool industry had already begun to decline by 1938, when a flood destroyed much of the village.

Elizabeth Warrington

Elizabeth Warrington FRS, is a British neuropsychologist specialized in the study of dementia. She holds a PhD in visual processing and is now an emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University College London. She formerly worked as the Head of the Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery where she is also a member of the Dementia Research Centre. She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986.
Biography.
Dr. Elizabeth Warrington received her PhD in visual processing from the University College London in the 1950s. She worked for a time as the Head of Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, England. She is currently an emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology for the University College London, specifically in the UCL Institute of Neurology. She is a member of the Dementia Research Centre associated with the University College London. Her research has focused on cognitive abilities, specifically the neurological basis of cognitive abilities, how the neural networks in the human brain work to perceive, remember, and talk about objects and events. She has participated in work on defining the differences between semantic memory and episodic memory which led to her identification of a new form of dementia, semantic dementia. She has published numerous tests and case studies and her work in these studies has been focused on diagnosing brain injuries. The tests she has developed can be used to help identify numerous types of brain damage including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and brain injuries resulting from a stroke. Her tests may also be used to track the recovery of these patients and to plan rehabilitation programs for them.
Research.
In general, Elizabeth Warrington's research work focused on cognitive abilities and deficits. Her research has played an important role in the discovery and characterization of semantic dementia. She conducted extensive research in the areas of amnesia, memory, and dementia. Warrington has also contributed to the development of more accurate tests used to diagnose degenerative brain conditions.
In one of Warrington's earliest studies, she investigated eighty right handed patients who showed signs of a unilateral cerebral lesion. The unilateral cerebral lesions may have included damage from problems such as a stroke or tumor. Subjects with lesions affecting the right side of their brain performed worse than subjects with left side lesions and control subjects when attempting both the Incomplete Letters Task and the Gollin Incomplete Figures Task. The results of this study provided evidence of hemispheric lateralization.
Entirely by accident, Elizabeth Warrington discovered a task in which patients suffering from severe amnesia displayed signs of memory. She accomplished this using the Gollin incomplete figures task. When presenting patients with the second viewing of the figures, patients showed good retention of the initially unrecognizable images. These patients were classified as displaying signs of “normal” memory.
To further validate the discovery of “normal” memory in severe amnesiacs, Warrington used methods involving stem completion. The stem completion tests involved patients learning a battery of words, and later identifying the learned words. Patients were able to identify a previously learned word when presented with the first three letters, but were unable to identify a previously learned word when given the choice between a learned word and unknown word. These tests provided further evidence of different types of memory, now known as implicit memory and explicit memory.
In a test administered by Warrington and Tim Shallice from University College London, the short term memory of a patient who suffered head trauma following a motorcycle accident was tested. Although the patient displayed a digit span of one (as opposed to the average persons digit span of five to nine), he was able to form certain types of long term memory. The collected data suggested that short term memory was not necessarily required for the formation of long term memories.
Cognitive Functioning Tests.
Elizabeth Warrington has conducted many ground breaking experiments and developed many cognitive functioning tests to measure a patient's cognitive abilities throughout her career. Warrington’s work is often credited with helping shape the basis of modern day cognitive psychology. Many of Warrington’s tests are still used today. 
One of her most influential experiments is the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, or the VOSP. This test was designed by Elizabeth Warrington and Merele James in 1991. The VOSP is used to help determine whether or not a lesion in the brain is causing impairments to object and space perception. This test limits other cognitive functions in order to assess certain aspects of object and space perception. The VOSP consists of eight untimed tests that are usually administered at a pace suitable for that particular patient. After completing eight tests, the scores are then compared to the scores of patients with right and left-cerebral lesions. This experiment is commonly used by psychologists today and has been featured in over 250 publications. The VOSP can be purchased from most online bookstores for around the price of 230.00 USD.>
Another test that is still in use is the Verbal and Spatial Reasoning Test also known as VESPAR. VESPAR is a test that was designed by Elizabeth Warrington and Dawn W. Langdon in 1996. VESPAR is a reasoning test that presents a fairly new approach in how reasoning tests are performed. This test is designed to measure the fluid intelligence in neurological patients. This test is unique in that it offers more accuracy than any other test available for this type of measurement. VESPAR is divided into six sections. There are three matched sets of verbal and spatial reasoning problems, where each is dedicated to one of three forms of inductive reasoning. This includes odd one out, by analogy, and series completion. VESPAR is able to overcome many restraints that arise when performing more conventional reasoning tests by using stimuli that is more readily accessed by patients who suffer from physical or cognitive impairments due to neurological illness. VESPAR does not use timing to help evaluate performance, instead it uses high frequency stimulus words or visually distinct spatial stimuli to help determine its results. VESPAR has a multiple choice format. This format has been adopted to reduce both short term memory load and output demands on the patient. The assessment of patients for neurodiagnostic and neurorehabilitation needs will be facilitated. VESPAR only requires the patient to do simple pointing gestures. The spatial section of the test measures the fluid intelligence of patients with aphasia. The verbal section does the same for patients with visual and spatial problems. VESPAR focuses more the instinctive ability of a patient, rather than educational experience. Thus, although originally developed for adult neurological populations, the test is suitable for a wide range of clinical, educational, occupational, and research applications. This test is also available for purchase at most online bookstores.

Naomi Datta

Naomi Datta, FRS (17 September 1922 – 30 November 2008) was a distinguished British geneticist. Working at Hammersmith Hospital in the 1950s and early 1960s she identified horizontal gene transfer as a source of multi-antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
Research history.
After qualifying in medicine in 1946, Datta joined the Public Health Laboratory Service as a bacteriologist and worked here for ten years. She then worked at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital for almost three decades, joining as a lecturer in 1957 and later becoming Professor of Microbial Genetics. It was here that she made a significant breakthrough by demonstrating that antibiotic resistance could be transmitted between bacteria, the first time this had been shown outside of Japan. 
In 1959 there was a severe outbreak of "Salmonella typhimurium" phage-type 27 and, as part of her research at Hammersmith Hospital, Datta examined 309 cultures to see if the strain was unaltered after moving through hosts. 25 of the 309 were found to be drug-resistant, eight of which were resistant to Streptomycin which had been used to treat the patients. Notably, Datta observed that earlier cultures of the salmonella typhimurium infection (from the start of the outbreak) were not drug-resistant, so it seemed that the antibiotic resistance had developed over time. 
Datta published these findings in 1960, in the paper "An outbreak of infection with Salmonella typhimurium in a general hospital", and later in 1962 in the paper "Transmissible drug resistance in an epidemic strain of Salmonella typhimurium" in the Journal of Hygiene.
In later years she published many important studies on the occurrence and significance of drug resistance plasmids in enterobacterial infections. For example, Dr. Datta co-authored (with Royston C. Clowes, Stanley Cohen, Roy Curtiss III, Stanley Falkow and Richard Novick) a proposal for uniform nomenclature for bacterial plasmids.
She also made distinguished contributions to research on the molecular biology of R factors, and she pioneered the classification of R factors and other plasmids by their incompatibilities. She found that some resistance genes, including those for gentamycin resistance, are located on transposons and are readily transferred between replicons.
Earlier background.
Born Naomi Goddard in London, she was educated at St Mary's School, Wantage in Oxfordshire and later at the University of Paris. At the outbreak of the World War II she returned to England to study medicine at University College London (UCL).
She married her husband, Prakash Datta, in 1943, having met him in Leatherhead, Surrey, where she was studying having been evacuated from the Capital two years earlier. She qualified as a doctor in 1946 and the following year worked as a junior doctor in various hospitals.
Later years.
Datta retired in 1984 and became Emeritus Professor of Microbial Genetics at the University of London. The year after her retirement, in 1985, she was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society. 
During her retirement, she continued to pursue academia by first studying a postgraduate course in Linguistics (although she was not able to obtain a qualification as she did not possess an undergraduate qualification in an arts subject), and then achieving a Master's degree in human evolution in the department of anthropology. At 75, she was the oldest in the group.
Known for her cooking and hospitality, Datta contributed to the Royal Society's anthology on food "But the crackling is superb".

El Molino Viejo

El Molino Viejo, also known as The Old Mill, is a former grist mill in the San Rafael Hills of present day San Marino, California, USA, and was built in 1816 by Father José Maria de Zalvidea from the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel (San Gabriel Mission). It is the oldest commercial building in Southern California, and was one of the first ten sites in Los Angeles County to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, receiving the recognition in 1971. The old mill has also been designated as a California Historical Landmark.
Construction and operation as a grist mill.
Though there are varying accounts of the exact date, San Gabriel Mission records indicate it was built in 1816. The mill was built on land owned by the San Gabriel Mission, and was designed by Franciscan Father José Maria de Zalvidea, then in charge of the mission. It was built by Tongvan Mission Indian laborers " "under the watchful eye" " of Father Zalvidea.
The mill was built like a fortress. Its lower walls are nearly five feet thick at the base, and are made of brick and volcanic tuff. Some have written that the thick fortress-like walls were intended to allow the padres to barricade themselves in the event of "a disturbance among their somewhat uncertain converts." The upper walls are made of sun-dried adobe slabs, and the building's surface is covered with a lime mortar made from burnt sea shells. The pine and sycamore beams are tied with leather thongs, and the structure is also supported by large buttresses which can still be seen on building's exterior corners.
Water was brought to the mill in an open ditch ("zanja") from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea designed an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.
It was the first water-powered grist mill in Southern California, and some have called it the first grist mill in California. While some have called Father Zalvidea's horizontal design a "mechanical marvel, evolved and constructed by a mastermind," others considered the design flawed as it splashed moisture up the shaft, leaving the flour damp. The mill was operational for only seven years, during which time it provided food for the missionaries and Indian neophytes, there were 1,644 Tongva-Gabrieleños in 1816 ("Population of Native California") in the mission community. In 1823, a New England-style mill with a vertical waterwheel was built adjacent to the mission. The new mill resulted in a superior product, and the old mill ceased operation.
Subsequent uses as a residence and golfing clubhouse.
Disputes over title.
After the new mill was opened in 1823, the Old Mill reportedly sat idle for 30 years, during which time it was victimized by vandals and the weather. In 1846, Pío Pico – last Mexican governor of Alta California – sold , including the mill, to Julian Workman and Hugo Reid (co-grantee of the adjacent Rancho Huerta de Cuati). 
However, after the Mexican Cession of California to the U.S. in 1848, John C. Fremont refused to accept the validity of the transaction. With title to the land in a state of uncertainty, James S. Waite (publisher of "The Star" newspaper) established squatter's rights over , including the Old Mill.
Occupancy by the Kewens.
The property was subsequently sold to Dr. Thomas White for $500. In 1858, Dr. White conveyed the "Old Mill Site" to his daughter Fannie Kewen; she and her husband, Col. E. J. C. Kewen, both lived there for 20 years. The Kewens added onto the building, installing French windows, a front portico, and a small plaza. Col. Kewen has been described as "old-time Southern gentleman" and "one of the most courteous and politely-polished men California has ever seen." There are many accounts of parties hosted by the Kewens at the Old Mill and of their "prodigal hospitality" and "gracious style of living". It was said that "the gallant and gay gathered from miles 'round, listened to the twanging of the guitar and the jolly click of the castenets, and through it all danced gay dances on the floors that once had echoed the quiet footfall of the priest." In 1879, the Kewens defaulted on a mortgage, and the property was foreclosed on by J. Edward Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck sold the property to Edward Mayberry in 1881, who used the structure as housing for his ranch superintendent.
Rediscovery in the late 19th century.
In 1898, "Los Angeles Times" reporter Topsy Tinkle wrote a lengthy article following a visit to El Molino Viejo. At that time, the mill was being used to store wine, causing the smell of wine to permeate the building, and as a sleeping place for hired men. Tinkle described the condition of the mill as follows:"The grinding-stones have gone, and also the machinery that in the romantic time of the old mission padres and their Indian neophytes, was wont to turn their corn into meal, and yet, in the material of the building itself, no sign of decay. The large oak beams, only ten inches apart, as sound as in the day the original trees lifted their leafy tops high in air. The cement of which the structure is made apparently defies time ... There are three wheel-houses, the arches of which have been bricked up, and the old millstones are at San Marino, J. De Barth Shorb's noted ranch near by, where they are used as stepping-stones. ... Padre and Indian have long gone to their rest, and the old mill is absolutely lifeless and deserted save many tiny chameleons that bask and sun themselves in the heated air ..."
Acquisition and use by the Huntingtons.
In 1903, the mill side was purchased by the Huntington Land and Improvement Company. When the Huntington Hotel opened in 1914 on the nearby hill, the land around the mill was turned into a golf course, with El Molino Viejo as the clubhouse. The land was later subdivided, leaving the Old Mill vacant.
Reconversion to residential use.
In 1927, Leslie Huntington Brehm, the widow of Henry Huntington's son, and her husband took over the property, intending to preserve it. They hired Frederick H. Ruppel, a contractor who had restored the Mission San Juan Capistrano. Ruppel turned the mill into a home with modern amenities, but he made no structural change to the original walls. Ruppel also preserved and restored the old features, and where new materials were needed, he sought to maintain the old Mission-style appearance. The Brehms never moved into the Old Mill, instead renting it to a series of tenants, including the Doerr, McDuffy and Washburn families. From 1954-1963, the mill was leased to the Connell family who were its last occupants.
Current use as a museum and art gallery.
When Mrs. Brehm died in 1962, the Old Mill was willed to the City of San Marino. The city has preserved the building and opened it to the public as a museum and art gallery, operated first by the California Historical Society and later by the Old Mill Foundation. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. A model showing how the mill operated is located on the ground floor of the museum. While nothing remains of the waterwheel, two of the millstones ("pictured above") are displayed in the garden area. The millstones were found more than a century after the mill closed on the grounds of the Huntington Library by General George S. Patton, who grew up in the area and recalled seeing them used as blocks for mounting horses. There is also a 16th-century volcanic rock fountain in the patio to the east of the mill. The fountain was acquired in Mexico by Mrs. Brehm's daughter, Mrs. Albert Doerr.
Legend of Catalina.
In his 1898 publication, Topsy Tinkle recounted a story that the Indians told about a natural spring located on the site of the Old Mill. The story told of a 16-year-old Indian named Catalina with "thick, jet-black hair" and "big, melting black eyes." Catalina lived in the time of the San Gabriel Mission and gave roses to the Virgin Mary in hopes that she could win the heart of the handsome Jose, even hoping that "something dreadful" would happen to another girl of whom Jose was fond. When Jose left for two years serving on a ship, Catalina turned her back on the Virgin, and Catalina began praying to the old "Mexican god", described as a "hideous clay image". Catalina died of sorrow when Jose did not return, and her body was buried on the spot where the mill was later built, a spot from which a natural flow of spring water "slowly oozes". According to the legend, oozing spring water is "only the tears from a loving woman's broken heart."
Historic designations.
As the oldest commercial building in Southern California, El Molino Viejo has been recognized as a historic site at the state and national levels. In 1937, it was listed in the Historic American Building Survey. It was one of the first ten sites in Los Angeles County to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, receiving the recognition in 1971. It has also been designated as a California Historical Landmark (#302).

Centre Market Place

Centre Market Place is a one block long street in Lower Manhattan, New York City, bordering Mulberry Street to the east, Grand Street to the south, Broome Street to the north, and Centre Street to the west. Centre Market Place was originally an extension of Orange Street (now Baxter Street) before being formally renamed Centre Market Place in April 1837, after Centre Market, which was west of the street. At one time, the street was at the top of a high hill. Currently, local residents consider Centre Market Place to be part of the NoLIta neighborhood.
At the southern end of the street, on the corner of Grand Street, is Onieal's restaurant, which features a cavernous wine cellar that once served as a speakeasy during Prohibition. Gentlemen of means would walk through the front of the Police Building, perhaps make a contribution to the "widows and orphan fund" and then walk through the cellar corridor connecting the two buildings. 
9 Centre Market Place was once the location to "The People's Bath House", a privately run public bathhouse built by the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. The People's Baths served as a model to which the City of New York would later build the city's truly public bathhouses.
The block also included several gun stores including the John Jovino at 5 Centre Market Place, and the older Frank Lava Gunsmith at 6 Centre Market Place. The gun stores were part of a gun district owing to its proximity to the police headquarters at 240 Centre St.
A row of townhouses at No. 1, 2, 4, and 5 were rehabilitated by two developers, a husband-and-wife team, incorporating found architectural castoffs scavenged from around the world as part of its facade.
The street was home to many well-known writers, poets, and artists, including the noted crime photographer Weegee, who lived in a small studio apartment at 5 Centre Market Pl.
Baxter Street starts at Grand Street (where Centre Market Place ends) and is a one-way street southbound until it ends at Worth Street. One block north of Worth Street, Baxter changes direction to become one-way northbound.

Why Do I Always Get it Wrong?

"Why Do I Always Get it Wrong?", written by Brian Hodgson and composed by John Beeby, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1989, performed by the sextet Live Report, led by Ray Caruana.
Live Report won the right to perform at Lausanne by winning the UK national final, "A Song for Europe", where they were the sixth act to perform. For the second of four consecutive years, Live Report was picked via a nationwide telephone vote, receiving more than twice as many votes as the second-place finisher. 
At Lausanne, the song was performed seventh on the night, after Belgium's Ingeborg Sergeant with "Door de wind", and before Norway's Britt Synnøve with "Venners nærhet." At the end of judging that evening, "Why Do I Always Get it Wrong?" took the second-place slot with 130 points. Norway, Portugal, Luxembourg, France and Germany all gave their 12 point designations to the UK that evening. Despite losing the contest by six points to Yugoslavia's Riva with "Rock Me," the UK actually received the most sets of 12 point designations for the evening (Yugoslavia received the 12 points from four countries).
For the second year in a row, the UK entered a ballad at the Eurovision final. This song revolved around a man who took off running "where lover won't find ," as she causes him to hurt, and leaving her presence for good is the only way to stop the pain. Crying out against his illogical love for the woman who has treated him so badly, Caruana asks, "Why do I always get it wrong?"
After Eurovision, the song placed at #73 on the UK Singles Chart.

Friends and Lovers (song)

"Friends and Lovers" is the title of a popular song from 1986. The song was first recorded as a duet by Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson in 1985. That recording remained unreleased until the summer of 1986, when it was released shortly after a version by Juice Newton and Eddie Rabbitt hit country radio. The country version featured the altered title of "Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)".
Pop version.
Gloria Loring is a singer and actress who beginning in 1980 portrayed the character Liz Chandler on the American soap opera "Days of our Lives". Her character was a lounge singer, so Loring was often called upon to perform on-screen; one of the songs she performed during this period was "Friends and Lovers", a song that was written by Jay Gruska and Paul Gordon. The song became the theme music for one of the popular supercouples on the show in the mid 1980s, Shane Donovan and Kimberly Brady (portrayed by Charles Shaughnessy and Patsy Pease).
In 1985, Carl Anderson (known for his portrayal of Judas Iscariot in both the film and stage versions of the Andrew Lloyd Webber / Tim Rice rock opera "Jesus Christ Superstar") appeared on "Days of our Lives" and performed the duet with Loring. The commercial release of this duet was delayed for months before becoming available in the summer of 1986, first as a single on the label USA Carrere, then later on Anderson's self-titled album on Epic Records and Loring's eponymous album on Atlantic Records. According to Loring, it had been turned down by most of the major American record labels at the time, and she had taken to referring to the song informally as "Friends and Lawyers".
The song was a hit when released, spending two weeks at No. 2 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in late September and early October 1986, but failing to reach the #1 slot which was occupied "Stuck with You" by Huey Lewis and the News. It remained in the Top 40 for 14 weeks. It reached No. 1 on the "Billboard" sales chart and No. 2 on the airplay chart (the two components of the Hot 100 chart). It also spent two weeks at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart. "Friends and Lovers" would be the only Top 40 hit for either performer. Loring would leave "Days of our Lives" the same year the single appeared on the music charts. Anderson died in 2004 from complications arising from a long battle with leukemia.
Country version.
In 1986, country-pop singers Juice Newton and Eddie Rabbitt released a version of "Friends and Lovers", altering the title to emphasize the final line of the chorus. Technically, Newton and Rabbitt's recording is not a cover version, since it was commercially available before the pop version was released. Therefore, even though Loring and Anderson recorded the song first, Newton and Rabbitt are credited with the original commercial version. Their duet was called "Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)", and although its arrangement differed from Loring and Anderson's recording, it is lyrically the same song. Both Newton ("Queen of Hearts", "Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me") and Rabbitt ("I Love a Rainy Night", "Every Which Way but Loose") had already enjoyed considerable success on both the pop and country music charts, and their version of the duet went to No. 1 on the "Billboard" country chart. This was Newton's final No. 1 though her last solo No. 1 had come eight months earlier with "Hurt".

St. Nicholas' Primary School, Carrickfergus

St. Nicholas' Primary School (Irish: "Bunscoil Naomh Nioclás, Carraig Fhearghais") is a Roman Catholic maintained primary school located in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
History.
The school origins date back to Mount Saint Nicholas National School, an inter-denominational National School, which opened in 1871, formerly located in the current school/chapel car park. In 1910, St. Nicholas' Boys and St. Nicholas' Girls Primary Schools, replaced the National School, whose building was subsequently used by Mount St. Nicholas playgroup until the 1990s.
In 1959 the school building was refurbished, helping to accommodate the growing Roman Catholic population in the town. This population growth is largely attributed to the industrialization of the town in the mid 20th century, with the town becoming a hub for the textiles industries, which attracted employees from Belfast and further afield, to settle in the town. This population growth resulted in the formation of St. Nicholas' High School in Carrickfergus, which opened its doors in September 1969.
In September 1992, the school amalgamated to form St. Nicholas' Primary School. This accommodated both boys and girls, in the same class, for the first time in the primary school's history. This date also coincided with the closure of the St. Colman's Catholic Primary School, Greenisland, resulting in an immediate influx of pupils from thia area to St. Nicholas' P.S.
Work began on building a new school in the former playground of the old St. Nicholas' P.S., which was completed and opened by September 1996, and officially opened and blessed by Patrick Walsh (Bishop) in March 1998. The new school has eight classrooms and a multi purpose gymnasium.
In the last decade the school numbers have declined rapidly, with an enrolment of circa 200 pupils in the 1990s, to half that today, with circa 100 pupils currently enrolled.

List of historical national anthems

The oldest national anthem, defined as "a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism", is the Dutch national anthem "Het Wilhelmus", which was written between 1568 and 1572, but not then given any official status. The first anthem to be officially proclaimed as such was "La Marcha Real", adopted by Spain in 1770. "Het Wilhelmus" was declared the national anthem of the Netherlands in 1932; both of these anthems remain in use today. A royal or imperial anthem is a song that is similar in patriotic character to a national anthem, but which specifically praises a monarch, or royal dynasty. Some states have doubled their royal or imperial anthem as their national anthem; for example, the Imperial Anthem of Iran, used from 1933 to 1979, served both as national anthem and as an explicit celebration of the Pahlavi dynasty.
An anthem may fall out of use if the country that uses it ceases to exist, or because it adopts a new anthem; the rationale for a new national anthem is often political, perhaps based on a new ruling dynasty or system of government. For example, following the French Revolution, which overthrew the monarchy, "La Marseillaise", a republican revolutionary song, became national anthem in 1795. Conversely, when the monarchy was restored 19 years later, the 16th-century royalist tune "Vive Henri IV" was revived and adapted to create "Le Retour des Princes français à Paris", an overt celebration of the restored government. Following a number of further changes, "La Marseillaise" was readopted in 1870 and remains France's contemporary national anthem.
Some historical anthems share the same tune; for example, "Heil dir im Siegerkranz", the Imperial German anthem, used the same music as Britain's national anthem, "God Save the Queen". There are also instances of the music of a former national anthem still being used in a current anthem; for instance, the modern national anthem of Germany, "Das Lied der Deutschen", uses the same tune as the 19th and early 20th-century Austro-Hungarian anthem "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser". Another well-known example is the "Hymn of the Soviet Union", used until its dissolution in 1991, which was given new words and adopted by the Russian Federation in 2000 to replace the unpopular instrumental anthem it had introduced in 1993.
This was not the first time that a country's "de facto" or "de jure" national anthem had proved controversial among its own people. "My Country, 'Tis of Thee", a "de facto" anthem of the United States during the 19th century, divided opinion as it used the same tune as "God Save the Queen". A more recent example is "Hej, Sloveni", the former Yugoslavian anthem which was retained by Serbia and Montenegro until 2006; because it was frequently booed when played in public – at sporting events, for example – it was eventually replaced.

Congregation Beth Israel (Gadsden, Alabama)

Congregation Beth Israel () was a Reform synagogue, located for most of its history at 761 Chestnut Street in Gadsden, Alabama. An outgrowth of Gadsden's Jewish religious school, it was founded in 1908 and incorporated in 1910. It moved into its Chestnut Street building in 1922, and joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1924.
From 1911 to 1944 it had no rabbi, and was led by "lay-religious-leader" Hugo Hecht. In 1944, Beth Israel hired its first full-time rabbi, Ernest Appel.
The synagogue was fire-bombed and its windows smashed in 1960, during a Friday night service. Two members who rushed outside were wounded with a shotgun by the attacker, a young Nazi sympathizer.
Membership was never high; the congregation had 38 members families in 1918, and this grew to 60 families in 1960. Membership fell as major employers closed operations, and Jews emigrated from Gadsden. By 2008, family membership was down to 26. The synagogue closed in 2010.
Early history.
Founded in 1908, and incorporated in January 1910, Beth Israel grew out of Gadsden's Jewish religious school, which was established in 1903. Initially the congregation had no rabbi. Every second Sunday from 1910 to 1911, Ferdinand Hirsch, a student rabbi, would come to Gadsden and teach the Sunday School in the morning and hold services in the afternoon.
Hugo Hecht, a young immigrant from Germany, acted as "lay-religious-leader" from 1911 to 1944. He conducted Shabbat and funeral services, wrote sermons, taught the Sunday school, and acted as secretary and treasurer. After a number of years, officers of the temple decided he should be given a remuneration of $20/week for his work.
Membership was 38 families by 1918. The congregational school held classes weekly, and had 15 students and 3 teachers. That year the synagogue's total income was $700 (today $).
Beth Israel broke ground and laid the cornerstone for its Classical Revival building at 761 Chestnut Street in March 1922, and moved in the following year. The Masonic dedication service was attended by hundreds of Gadsden citizens, and the main speaker was Reverend W.R. Rigell of the First Baptist Church. The completed structure had a stained-glass window with the Biblical verse fragment "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF" () above the front door.
The congregation joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1924. Gadsden's Jewish community was not as badly affected by the Great Depression as others in more agriculturally-based towns, and benefited from an influx of Jewish servicemen from nearby Camp Sibert during World War II.
Full-time rabbis, attack.
In 1944 Beth Israel hired its first full-time rabbi, Ernest Appel. From a long line of rabbis from Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), Appel emigrated to the United States in 1936 as a refugee from Nazi Germany. By 1946, when he moved to a synagogue in Maryland, the congregation had grown to nearly 30 families.
After receiving ordination from Hebrew Union College, Saul J. Rubin became Beth Israel's rabbi in September, 1958. There he met and married Elsie Parsons, Hecht's granddaughter. Rubin served until 1960, when he became assistant rabbi at Congregation Beth Ahabah in Richmond, Virginia.
On March 25, 1960, the synagogue and its members were subject to an antisemitic attack. About 180 members were attending a Friday evening service to dedicate the new Zemurray Social Hall, and led by then-rabbi Saul Rubin and Rev. John Speaks and Dr. Franklin Denson of First Methodist Church, when windows were smashed and the synagogue fire-bombed. Two members—Alvin Lowi and Alan Cohn—who rushed out to see what was happening were met by Jerry Hunt, a 16 year-old Nazi sympathizer, who wounded them both with a shotgun, then fled. Lowi was just shot in the hand, but one of Cohn's aortas was nicked, and he almost died, requiring of blood. Earlier that week Hunt had attended a rally for antisemitic and white supremacist politician John G. Crommelin, and had had a fight with a Jewish boy over a chess game at the Gadsden Community Centre.
Decline.
Membership peaked in 1960, at 60 families. In the 1970s and 1980s factories of major employers such as Republic Steel, and many Jewish-owned stores closed and younger members emigrated in search of employment. In the 1980s and early 1990s the rabbis were Fred Raskind and Mark Peilen. Family membership was still 57 in the early 1980s, but dropped to 43 in 1993, 38 in 2000, and only 26 by 2008. That year the youngest member was 48, and there were no children for the educational programs.
, the rabbi was Scott Saulson of Atlanta, who came in once a month to provide services. A former member of the Peace Corps, graduate of Hebrew Union College, and PhD in Semitics from the University of South Africa, Saulson was also chaplain at the Atlanta Jewish Family & Career Services, and was a speaker for the Darfur Coalition of Georgia. The congregation still held services weekly, but, as was the case during most of its early history, they were lay-led.
In 2010, the congregation ceased operation. The congregation's website stated that the synagogue had closed, effective July 1, 2010.

Princess Marie of Orléans (1865–1909)

Princess Marie Amélie Françoise Hélène d'Orléans (13 January 1865 – 4 December 1909) was a French princess by birth and a Danish princess by marriage, as the wife of Prince Valdemar. She was politically active with left-wing sympathies by the standards of her day.
Biography.
Background.
Marie was the eldest child of Robert, duke of Chartres, and his wife Princess Françoise d'Orléans. Her father was the second son of Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans, and Duchess Helena of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Françoise was the daughter of François d'Orléans, prince de Joinville, and Princess Francisca of Brazil.
Born during the reign in France of her family's rival, Napoléon III, she grew up in England, where her family had moved in 1848. She moved to France with her family after the fall of Napoleon in 1871. She defined herself as "une bourgeoise".
Marriage.
After obtaining papal consent, Marie married Prince Valdemar of Denmark, the youngest son of King Christian IX of Denmark, on 20 October 1885 in a civil ceremony in Paris and again in a religious ceremony in the Château d'Eu two days later. She remained a Roman Catholic, he a Lutheran. They adhered to the dynastic arrangement usually stipulated in the marriage contract in such circumstances: sons were to be raised in the faith of their father, daughters in that of their mother.
The couple took up residence at Bernstorff Palace outside Copenhagen, in which Valdemar had been born. Since 1883, he had lived there with his nephew and ward Prince George of Greece, a younger son of Valdemar's elder brother Vilhelm, who had become King of the Hellenes in 1863 as George I. The king had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist him in the Danish navy and consigned him to the care of his brother Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet.
Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George would later describe to his "fiancée", Princess Marie Bonaparte, the profound attachment he developed for his uncle from that day forward.
It was into this household and relationship that Marie came to live. In 1907, when George brought his bride to Bernstorff for the first family visit, Marie d'Orléans was at pains to explain to Marie Bonaparte the intimacy which united uncle and nephew, so deep that at the end of each of George's several yearly visits to Bernstorff, he would weep, Valdemar would feel ill, and the women learned to be patient and not intrude upon their husbands' private moments.
On this and subsequent visits, the Bonaparte princess found herself a great admirer of the Orléans princess, concluding that she was the only member of her husband's large family in Denmark and Greece endowed with brains, pluck, or character. During the first of these visits, Valdemar and Marie Bonaparte found themselves engaging in the kind of passionate intimacies she had looked forward to with her husband who, however, only seemed to enjoy them vicariously, sitting or lying beside his wife and uncle. On a later visit, George's wife carried on a passionate flirtation with Prince Aage, Valdemar's eldest son. In neither case does it appear that Marie objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention.
George criticized Marie to his wife, alleging that she was having an affair with his uncle's stablemaster. He also contended that she drank too much alcohol and could not conceal the effects. But Marie Bonaparte found no fault with Marie d'Orléans; rather she admired her forbearance and independence under circumstances which caused her bewilderment and estrangement from her own husband.
Life and influence.
Marie was described as impulsive, witty and energetic, and introduced a more relaxed style to the stiff Danish court. She never fully learned to speak Danish. The marriage was friendly. She gave her children a free upbringing, and her artistic taste and Bohemian habits dominated her household. She was informal, not snobbish, believed in social equality, expressed her own opinions, and performed her ceremonial duties in an unconventional manner. She once wrote: "I believe that a person, regardless of her position, should be herself" (1896). She liked both to ride and to drive and was known for her elegance. She was the official protector of the fire brigade and let herself be photographed in a fire brigade uniform, which was caricatured, and as a support to her spouse's career as a marine, she had an anchor tattooed on her upper arm. She once said regarding complaints about her unconventional manners: "Let them complain, I am just as happy nevertheless".
She had asked the permission of the court to leave the house without a lady-in-waiting, and she had mainly spent her time with artists. She painted and photographed and was a student of Otto Bache and Frants Henningsen. She participated in the exhibitions at Charlottenborg in 1889, 1901 and 1902 and was a member of the Danish Arts Academy.
She refused to obey the expectation on royal women to stay away from politics. In 1886, Valdemar declined the throne of Bulgaria with her consent. She belonged to the political left and participated in convincing the king to agree to the reforms of 1901, which led to an appointment of a Venstre government, and the "de facto" introduction of parliamentarism. In 1902 she rejected the idea of offering the Danish West Indies to the United States. She also saw to the interests of France: she was credited by the French press with having influenced the Franco-Russian alliance in 1894 and the peace in the French-German Colonial conflict over Morocco in 1905. She assisted her friend H.N. Andersen, the founder of the East Asiatic Company, with contacts in his affairs in Thailand. She was a popular person in Denmark.
Marie's husband and three sons were in India "en route" to Siam when they received word that she had died at Bernstorff.
Issue.
The couple had five children:
Legacy.
Princess Marie is commemorated with a monument at Langelinie, near St. Alban's English Church in Copenhagen. It was installed in 1912 and features a bust created by Carl Martin-Hansen.

Alan West Brewer (1915 – 21 November 2007) was a Canadian-English physicist and climatologist. Born in Montreal, Canada and raised in Derby, England, he earned a scholarship to study physics at the University College of London. He received his M.Sc. there, and began to work for the Met Office in 1937. During World War II, he researched contrails for the Royal Air Force, making the discovery that the stratosphere is much drier than had been presumed. Later this observation led to the development of Brewer-Dobson circulation. Brewer worked at the Subdepartment of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, University of Oxford from 1948 until 1962, when he became a professor at University of Toronto. In 1977, Brewer retired from the University of Toronto, returning to England, in Devon, where he farmed until nearly 80 years old.
In late 1959, he and James Milford developed the Oxford-Kew ozone sonde. He also developed the Brewer ozone spectrophotometer with Dave Wardle which is currently the most accurate instrument for measuring ozone.
Brewer married Iris, another UCL physicist, in 1939. They had three children.

Canon EOS D2000

The Canon EOS D2000 (a Canon branded Kodak DCS 520) is a 2-megapixel digital single-lens reflex camera developed by Kodak on a Canon EOS-1N body. It was released in March 1998. It features a CCD sensor and can shoot at 3.5 frames per second. Many enthusiasts regard the D2000 as Canon's first truly usable Digital SLR. It was released in tandem with the Canon EOS D6000 (a rebranded "Kodak DCS 560"), a 6-megapixel model.
Like its predecessor, the EOS DCS 3, the D2000 uses an EOS-1N camera body with a Kodak digital back. However, the digital back was completely redesigned, being better integrated into the body, using a higher-resolution APS-C sized sensor, adding a second PCMCIA card slot, replacing the SCSI interface with an IEEE 1394 interface, and adding a color screen for viewing images that had been taken, a feature that was lacking from the DCS 3 and the higher-end DCS 1. Other incremental improvements such as a higher shooting rate and a swappable, rechargeable battery pack were included.
The D2000 was the last of the Kodak / Canon press cameras. It was sold by Kodak until at least as late as 2001. Canon's first home-grown professional digital SLR, the Canon EOS-1D, was launched later the same year.

Like the third season, the Dutch Season 4 was broadcast by Yorin as well. It lasted from 28 August till 23 December 2002 (117 days). Presenter was Martijn Krabbé (son of Jeroen Krabbé), aided by psychologist Dr. Steven Pont. This season the house was again divided in a rich area (the Bungalow) and a poor area (the Bunker). Unlike Season 3, allotment to either side depended on individual tasks, confrontations and dilemmas. As before, some of the housemates were kept in seclusion for a while, this time around in Portugal. All participants were relatively young, and selected upon their single status. As planned, this led to several relationships from which the one between Arthur and Ursula endured for the longest time. Stefan, working in the porn-business, didn't manage to choose between former Jehovah witness Daniela, Geesje and Margriet. This wasn't very much appreciated by the girls. Dutch Moroccan Mustapha put his stamp on the program by insisting to upheld the Ramadan. In spite of that, ‘Mushi’ was involved in various rude arguments with the emancipated Margriet and Fortuynist Arthur.

High Hopes (Canadian TV series)

High Hopes is a Canadian television soap opera that was shown on both Canadian and United States television, starring actor Bruce Gray.
The series was produced by Y&R Associates, Ltd, in conjunction with DCA Productions, Incorporated, and was filmed in Toronto. It was shown on CBC Television, in Canada, and was syndicated to US television stations. Canadian producer was Karen Hazzard. The show was initially directed by Bruce Minnix, and later by several Canadian directors, including Nigel Napier-Andrews. It was written by Bryan Barney, Mort Forer, Marian Waldman and Winifred Wolfe.
Premise.
Gray headlined the show, playing the role of Dr. Neal Chapman, a psychiatrist/family counselor who lived and worked in Port Hamilton, a fictitious community located in Canada, and was also associated with Delaney College, Port Hamilton's institution of higher learning. Much of the action was set at either the college, or in his large home which also served as his office. 
Neal was divorced from his former wife Helen (Candace O'Connor) and they (supposedly) had a grown daughter, Jessica, nicknamed Jessie (Marianne McIssac), a student at Delaney College, who lived with him. Also living in the Chapman house was his mother, Meg (Doris Petrie); Louise Bates (Jayne Eastwood) a Port Hamilton real estate agent who had sold Neal his house, and his close friend, Port Hamilton attorney Walter Telford (Colin Fox, Granville Van Dusen), who lived with his wife, Evelyn Telford (Deborah Turnbull). Walter, Evelyn, Louise and another person, Dr. Jean Bataille, were all tenants in Neal's home. 
Neal also worked with Dr. Dan Girard (Jan Muszynski), a physician who worked at Port Hamilton's hospital.
Despite his numerous counseling appointments and work at the hospital, Neal also found time for romance. He was involved romantically with Louise and also with local television talk show host, Trudy Bowen (Barbara Kyle). 
One of the families Neal counseled was the Stewart family, one of Port Hamilton's more affluent families, which was composed of successful businessman husband Michael Stewart, Sr. (Michael Tait); his wife, Norma, (Vivian Reis) and their son, Michael, Jr. (Gordon Thomson). Another family he counseled was the Sperrys, Amy (Gina Dick), a student at Delaney College, and her mother, Doris (Mignon Elkins). 
Much of the focus of the series was Neal counseling his many clients, who were members of the Port Hamilton community, and/or Delaney College's students and faculty, whilst his own troubles mounted. 
Neal had to deal with the trauma of realizing that Jessie wasn't his and Helen's daughter at all. She was revealed to be the daughter of Helen's sister, Paula Myles (Nuala Fitzgerald) and another man. Upon hearing this shocking news, Jessie took her newly discovered mother's name of Myles, and then sexually went after the man who was no longer her father. Jessie's real father was never revealed. 
The show had a brief run in 1978, and was eventually cancelled. Musical arrangement was produced by Aeolus Productions, known for the themes on American soap operas like "All My Children" and "One Life to Live".
Notable alumni.
Notable actors on the show, besides Gray and Eastwood who were already well established when this show aired, included Gordon Thomson, undoubtedly the show's most successful alumnus (he played Michael Stewart, Jr), who went on to much greater fame as Adam Carrington, the villainous son of Blake and Alexis Carrington on the 1980s prime-time soap "Dynasty"; Dorothy Malone who had been best known for her role of Constance MacKenzie in the 1960s soap opera, Peyton Place who played Carol Herzog; actor Nehemiah Persoff who played Carol's husband, Dr. Aaron Herzog; Granville Van Dusen and Colin Fox both of whom played attorney, Walter Telford; and Geraint Wyn Davies, best known for his role on the series "Forever Knight", in one of his earliest roles, playing a Delaney College student named Glen.

Tiberio Crispo

Tiberio Crispo (1498 – October 10, 1566) was a cardinal-nephew of Pope Paul III, raised to the cardinalate on December 19, 1544, and the bishop of Sessa Aurunca (1565-1566). He was possibly an illegitimate son of Paul III; Costanza Farnese and Ranuccio Farnese (d. 1529), the two undisputed legitimate children of Paul III, were born before his election as pope. Like other cardinal-nephews, Crispo was the castellan of Castel Sant'Angelo.
Crispo was deacon of S. Agata de' Goti from 1545 to 1551 and continued to hold the deaconry "pro illa vice" until 1562.
As papal legate to Perugia, Crispo was a "driving force behind the architectural renewal of the city". For example, in 1547 Crispo commissioned Galeazzo Alessi for the construction of Santa Maria del Popolo to replace a church demolished by the construction of the Via Nuova. He also commissioned a palace in Bolsena that bears his name, "Palazzo di Tiberio Crispo" (also known as the "Palazzo Crispo Marsciano" or "Palazzo Rondanini alla Rotonda"), which was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger circa 1543; after the death of Sangallo in 1546, Raffaello da Montelupo was called in to finish the palace, which remained incomplete, however, after the deaths of both Crispo and Raffaello in 1566.
Historical research indicates that Crispo also likely owned the ""Palazzo Nobile"" in Rome, a palace originally commissioned for Thomas Cardinal Wolsey circa 1507 before passing to the Aldobrandini family; Crispo likely commissioned the 400 square metres of frescos in the palace which celebrate the life of Paul III.
After the death of Paul III, Crispo participated in the conclaves of 1549-1550 (administrator of Amalfi at the time), April 1555 (administrator of Sessa Arunca and Amalfi at the time), May 1555, 1559, 1565-1566 (bishop of Sabina at the time).
Research related to the life and patronage of Crispo is ongoing in historical archives in Rome (States Archives, Vatican Secret Archives, Vatican Library) and Umbria (States Archives of Foligno, Historical Diocesan Archives of Perugia, States Archives of Perugia).

Hurl!

Hurl! was an American TV game show from G4 that first premiered on G4 in the USA on July 16, 2008. It takes a unique twist on competitive eating. The concept is for competitors to alternate between challenges of competitive eating and extreme activities in order to see who will be last to vomit. The winner receives $1,000 cash on the spot.
Format.
The show begins with an unidentified person shopping for food and purchasing the food for the current episode, with a narration about competition. After the food is scanned through the register, the clerk asks "What are you going to do with all this stuff?"
Prior to the game beginning, some information is provided via the narrators and on-screen text. All on-screen information for the viewer is done by holding up a post-it note or a notebook with handwriting on them. The "one simple rule" of the game is incorrectly described by the narrator as "whoever eats the most and hurls the least, wins". In fact the winner is the contestant that eats the most and hurls the "last" or not at all. Five competitors are introduced by name, height, weight, and occupation. The five begin the game by eating large quantities of food, usually a single savory dish accompanied with a drink to help wash it down. All food and drinks are identified as being organic. The food is placed on deli scales, which are used to determine through subtraction how much each competitor eats. Of the five competitors, only the three that eat the most in a span of five minutes make it through to the second round.
The second round involves some sort of physical or recreational activity, usually one that involves large amounts of spinning, for five minutes. The activity can end early if one of the contestants vomits. A "hurl" is defined on the show as any "swallowed" food that comes out of the mouth. If a player vomits into their mouth and it does not come out, it is not a "hurl".
For the third round, competitors return to the scales and eat for another four minutes. Sometimes they eat the same food as the first round, while other times they move to a second food item, usually a dessert. If three competitors make it to the third round, then the two that eat the most in the third round move on, unless somebody vomits first.
After the third round, if two competitors are left, a fourth round of extreme activities is done in a "sudden barf" format: first to "hurl", loses. Sometimes the extreme activity is done blindfolded to induce disequilibrium and nausea. If necessary, a fifth round of eating and a sixth round of blindfolded extreme activities are done as well. If both players make it through all six rounds without hurling, then the one that ate the most during just the fifth round wins the contest.
The game crew that runs the competition is called the "hazmat team". They are several people dressed in Level C hazmat suits, complete with gas masks, and act as a cleanup crew. Although they are dealing with bodily fluids, necessitating some precaution, their dress is exaggerated for comedic effect.
When a player vomits on-screen, the vomit is censored with numbered buckets and a pinball game sound effect. The buckets are used to arbitrarily rate the scale of the vomiting, up to an , although in Episode 11, a contestant hurls while being spun by a Sumo wrestler, and the narrator observes that on a scale of 1 to 5 buckets, this was an 11 bucket hurl. They are usually (but not always) preceded by a "hurl warning" with a handwritten note in front of the camera and a Klaxon, which also is sometimes used with close calls and fakeouts. The show also shows various "strategies" employed by some players to either eat more food or try to induce other players to vomit. Each strategy or technique has a number that is shown to the viewer on a handwritten note.
The last one remaining wins $1,000, which is paid immediately in cash by "Manny" (Manny Salcido), the leader of the hazmat team. If the winner also ate the most food in the contest, then they also win the "Iron Stomach Award". Sometimes the winner will vomit after their win; since they already won, this does not affect the outcome of the game. The show will also depict competitors that have lost and vomit after being eliminated.
The G4 network aired all 11 episodes in an uncensored (no buckets and no sound effects) format after the censored episodes had been shown.
Reaction.
Viewer reaction was mixed. It currently is rated as a "fair" program with a 6.2/10 score on sixteen total votes at TV.com.
Entertainment Weekly gave it a positive review.

Functional analysis (psychology)

Functional analysis in behavioral psychology is the application of the laws of operant conditioning to establish the relationships between stimuli and responses. To establish the function of a behavior, one typically examines the "four-term contingency": first by identifying the Motivating Operations (EO or AO), then identifying the antecedent or trigger of the behavior, identifying the behavior itself as it has been operationalized, and identifying the consequence of the behavior which continues to maintain it.
Functional analysis in behavior analysis employs principles derived from the natural science of behavior analysis to determine the "reason", purpose or motivation for a behavior. A functional analysis of behavior requires that data be collected on changes in the dependent variable (behavior) that occur as a result of the direct manipulation of independent variables (antecedents and consequences); therefore, functional analysis of behavior should not be confused with functional assessment procedures such as ABC assessments because they do not involve the direct manipulation of independent variables and the use of experimental designs.
Applications in clinical psychology.
Functional analysis and consequence analysis are commonly used in certain types of psychotherapy to better understand, and in some cases change, behavior. It is particularly common in behavioral therapies such as behavioral activation, although it is also part of Aaron Beck's cognitive therapy. In addition, functional analysis modified into a behavior chain analysis is often used in dialectical behavior therapy.
There are several advantages to using functional analysis over traditional assessment methods. Firstly, behavioral observation is more reliable than traditional self-report methods. This is because observing the individual from an objective stand point in their regular environment allows the observer to observe both the antecedent and the consequence of the problem behavior. Secondly, functional analysis is advantageous as it allows for the development of behavioral interventions, either antecedent control or consequence control, specifically designed to reduce a problem behavior. Thirdly, functional analysis is advantageous for interventions for young children or developmentally delayed children with problem behaviors, who may not be able to answer self-report questions about the reasons for their actions.
Despite these benefits, functional analysis also has some disadvantages. The first that no standard methods for determining function have been determined and meta-analysis shows that different methodologies appear to bias results toward particular functions as well as not effective in improving outcomes. Second, Gresham and colleagues (2004) in a meta-analytic review of JABA articles found that functional analysis did not produce greater effect sizes compared to simple contingency management programs. Third, while functional analysis has been applied to a host of populations (i.e.) much of the current functional analysis research has been limited to children with developmental disabilities.
Professional organizations.
The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) also has an interest group in behavior analysis, which focuses on the use of behavior analysis in the school setting including functional analysis.
Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the American Psychological Association's division 25 – Behavior analysis. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology and school psychology both of which focus on the use of functional analysis in the school setting.
The World Association for Behavior Analysis offers a certification for clinical behavior therapy and behavioral consultation, which covers functional analysis [http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html].

Al-Kum

Al-Kum (, officially known as al-Kum-al-Muwarraq-Beit Maqdum-Humsa) is a Palestinian village in the southern West Bank, part of the Hebron Governorate and located 13 kilometers west of Hebron. Its municipal borders stretch from the border with Israel in the west to boundaries of the city of Dura in the east. It had a population of 2,568 in the 2007 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.
The modern village was formed as a result of a 1995 merger between the villages of al-Kum, al-Muwarraq, Beit Maqdum and Humsa with al-Kum being the largest and in the middle of the latter three. Al-Kum and Beit Maqdum were founded sometime in the early 19th-century during Ottoman rule in Palestine. Most of the residents of the four villages were migrants from nearby Dura or Palestinian refugees who fled there following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The principal families are Rajoub, al-Awawda and al-Sharha. Following the founding of the modern village, a six-member village council was established to administer its affairs and provide some municipal services.
The primary health care facilities for the village are at al-Kum designated by the Ministry of Health as level 1, close by is Deir Sammit where the primary healthcare facilities are at level 2.
