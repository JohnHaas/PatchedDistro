Ashorocetus

Ashorocetus is a monotypic genus of an extinct primitive baleen whale of the family Aetiocetidae. It was named by , and contains one species, "A. eguchii". Fossils of this whale are found from the Chattian Morawan formation, near Ashoro, of upper Oligocene () Hokkaido, Japan (, paleocoordinates ). "Ashorocetus eguchii" was described based on a partial skull and is named after the type locality and Kenichiro Eguchi of the Ashoro Museum of Paleontology.
Description.
The placement of "A. polydentatus" in "Aetiocetus" has, however, been questioned, as has the monophyly (and therefore the proposed subfamilies) of Aetiocetidae.

New York Methodist Hospital

New York Methodist Hospital (NYM) is a hospital located in the historic brownstone neighborhood of Park Slope in Brooklyn, New York, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, on Sixth Street. The hospital is a 651-bed voluntary, non-profit hospital and serves almost 38,000 inpatients each year. Another 250,000 outpatient visits and services are logged annually. The Hospital is also a major teaching hospital, with ten graduate medical education programs and five schools that provide training in allied health professions. New York Methodist Hospital is affiliated with the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. They are also a member of the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System which provides access to physicians and resources.
New York Methodist has a number of institutes that bring together multidisciplinary specialists to provide care and offer community education and physician referral services. These are the Institute for Advanced and Minimally Invasive Surgery, the Institute for Asthma and Other Lung Diseases, the Institute for Cancer Care, the Institute for Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, the Institute for Digestive and Liver Disorders, the Institute for Family Care, the Institute for Neurosciences, the Institute for Orthopedic Medicine and Surgery, the Institute for Vascular Medicine and Surgery and the Institute for Women's Health.
Since 2006, NYM has received the Consumer's Choice Award for Brooklyn every year. The award, given by the National Research Corporation, recognizes hospitals with outstanding service and quality marketing areas across the United States. Winners are determined by consumer perceptions on best doctors, best nurses, quality and image ratings collected through a survey.
History.
Mission.
By 1880, the population of Brooklyn was nearly 600,000. As businessmen and builders plotted the development of new residential districts to house this burgeoning population and planned new transit lines to move commuters between home and work, Brooklynites enjoyed themselves listening to concerts at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, taking a dip in the ocean at Coney Island or cheering on their own Brooklyn Atlantics at the Union Base Ball Grounds in Williamsburg.
It was also a busy year for the Reverend James Monroe Buckley, editor of the influential Methodist Episcopal periodical The Christian Advocate. Buckley, formerly the pastor of a congregation on Hanson Place, had set his heart on founding a new hospital. Buckley was well aware that as Brooklyn continued to grow, accidents, as well as the other health emergencies besetting an expanding population, required new and state-of-the-art hospital facilities. As a Methodist, he also felt that his denomination should play a role in implementing and sustaining the medical and social services that an increasingly urban America needed. In January 1881, he used the columns of The Christian Advocate to challenge his fellow Methodists to establish such a facility, asking them, “Is it not time that somewhere we built a hospital?”
Buckley’s challenge was promptly answered by George Ingraham Seney, a prominent banker, art connoisseur, Methodist layman and Brooklyn resident. Seney pledged $100,000 and several land lots to begin construction of the hospital pavilions, and to incorporate the institution and appoint a board of trustees. On May 27, 1881, the Methodist Episcopal Hospital was born when Buckley and his associates obtained a charter from the State of New York. On September 21 of that year, they laid the cornerstone for the Hospital’s main building
Reality.
On December 19, 1887, the Methodist Episcopal Hospital admitted its first patient. During its first year of operation, the Hospital’s medical faculty numbered sixteen: two attending surgeons, two attending physicians, four assistants, two consulting physicians, two consulting surgeons, one pathologist and a house staff of three additional doctors. The Hospital also attracted a small support staff of “internes,” new doctors in need of postgraduate training, who among their other duties were responsible for examining and recommending admission of new patients. In 1888, the Hospital opened its Training School for Nurses, which immediately proved to be a highly effective educational program as well as a source of nursing support for the doctors. The Children’s Ward, which opened in 1889, inaugurated Methodist’s commitment to pediatric care for Brooklyn’s youngest residents.
In its earliest years, the Hospital divided its services between the “medical” and the “surgical,” with the latter encompassing the vast majority of its patient caseload. While some of this surgery was elective, much of it consisted of emergency cases rushed to the Hospital by its ambulance. As the Hospital’s first annual report observed in 1888, “the great strain which our intense modern life puts upon both body and mind” jeopardized the well-being of Brooklynites in the forms of industrial machinery, urban overcrowding and traffic, and “the multiplication of vices always associated with crowded populations,” including alcoholism and addiction.
As a community hospital, Methodist treated patients for a seemingly endless variety of ailments and afflictions, ranging from epilepsy, “hysteria,” typhoid fever, and opium and gas poisoning, to providing corrective surgery for a veteran whose legs had been amputated during the Civil War. It also became the principal health center for the young single women, many of them immigrants, who worked as live-in domestic servants, cooks and nannies for the moneyed families occupying Park Slope’s new brownstone townhouses.
By 1907, the Hospital’s original seventy beds had grown to two hundred. And by 1912, the staff and trustees could look back proudly on twenty five years of service in which the Hospital had cared for a total of 42,879 inpatients, provided nearly $1 million in free care and over 100,000 outpatient dispensary visits.
The Baby Hospital.
The “roaring twenties” would witness new construction at the Hospital, and by mid-decade, Methodist’s total bed capacity had risen to 375. To reach the Hospital during emergencies, Brooklyn residents could now rely on a General Motors ambulance that had replaced the much-used old horse-drawn vehicles. Perhaps most notable of the Hospital’s new additions was the Maternity Building, completed in 1924. Obstetrics had become one of the Hospital’s “growth” fields. In the Maternity Building’s first eight months, 863 babies were born, and the Hospital’s doctors made news in 1925 when they delivered three sets of twins within 24 hours. Even during the financially trying times of the Great Depression and the rations of wartime, the Maternity Building remained busy.
With the end of World War II and Korean War, veterans and their wives created their own “baby boom” at the Hospital. The Maternity Building had become one of the Hospital’s busiest. In 1952, the Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported that its staff had delivered 54,300 babies since the Pavilion had opened in 1924. Methodist was now known throughout Brooklyn as “The Baby Hospital.”
Mother Hospital of Methodism.
Since its inception, the Hospital’s denominational orientation was a key feature of its identity. Over the years, board members and administrators continued to describe patients, regardless of their religious beliefs, as “guests of the Church.” The Hospital’s affiliation resulted in a name change. In 1969, as the three American branches of Methodism prepared to come together as the United Methodist Church, Methodist Episcopal Hospital officially became the Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn. The UMC and the Hospital have since replaced their corporate connection with a “traditional” relationship.
The institution continues to be proud of its identity as the “Mother Hospital of Methodism,” the very first of 78 United Methodist Church-affiliated hospitals in the United States. In 1970, the Hospital was designated a National Historic Landmark of the United Methodist Church. The plaque, displayed at the Hospital, reads, in part: “The First Methodist Hospital in the world established May 27, 1881 in the City of Brooklyn, NY, on this site.”
A New Era.
By 1963, the Hospital was the workplace of 141 full-time physicians and surgeons, a consulting staff of 36 and a courtesy staff of thirty six, over 400 full-time nurses, 170 student nurses, fifty two interns and residents, 138 volunteers, and 885 other workers.
As New York City weathered a fiscal crisis and a widespread reputation for urban decay in the 1970s, Brooklyn was experiencing the first stirrings of a rebirth that would blossom fully in the decades to come. After 1965, revised federal immigration laws drew fresh generations of newcomers to New York City, many of whom settled in Brooklyn, where they reinvigorated old neighborhoods and community businesses. In Park Slope, young professionals recognized the charm and convenience of one of Brooklyn’s most distinguished neighborhoods and began moving in, changing the commercial and residential character of the district.
In harmony with the borough’s regained vitality, the Methodist Hospital undertook a modernization program that renewed and enhanced the entire institution. The old Nurses’ Residence building was transformed into a new East Pavilion to meet the need for more office space. The eight-story New Pavilion opened in 1983 with a state-of-the-art operating room suite, recovery rooms, an obstetrical suite, delivery rooms and nurseries, intensive care units, a blood bank and clinical laboratories. In 1997, the New Pavilion was renamed the John E. Carrington Pavilion to honor Dr. Carrington, a Methodist minister and trustee who joined the board in 1968 and has served as its chairman since 1979.
Growth and Innovation.
The 1990s proved to be a busy and momentous decade for the Hospital. A major commitment was made to new, minimally invasive surgery techniques. Additionally, the Hospital availed itself of new developments in diagnostic imaging technology such as ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear medicine. New programs in place by the mid-1990s offered a wide array of innovative inpatient and outpatient services. Among them were a cardiac catheterization unit, a cardiopulmonary physiology laboratory, a chest pain emergency center, a chronic pain management center, a sleep disorders center, a reproductive endocrinology lab, a spine and arthritis center and a women’s diagnostic center.
As the 1990s progressed, it became clear that market forces were driving health care providers into a new era, even without health care reform legislation. The Hospital’s trustees secured the institution’s future when they entered into an alliance with The New York Hospital, now the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, in 1993. The New York Hospital Care Network, now the New York-Presbyterian Healthcare System, was formed to ensure that people in the metropolitan area would continue to have access to high quality medical care in spite of a rapidly evolving health care system and escalating costs. Membership in the System and affiliation with the Weill Cornell Medical College also enhanced graduate medical education at the Hospital, as residents in many of its ten training programs now benefited from shared NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell faculty members in several subspecialties. A new name accompanied membership in the System: in 1994 the medical complex centered on Sixth Street and Seventh Avenue officially became New York Methodist Hospital (NYM).
Twenty-first century.
The first years of the 21st century brought further innovation at New York Methodist Hospital. The year 2000 saw the opening of new obstetrics facilities that included a mother-baby unit (post partum floor), an expanded Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a birthing center with 12 labor-delivery-recovery rooms committed to a “family-centered birthing experience.” Along with a state-of-the-art fertility center, these new facilities upheld NYM’s proud reputation as the “The Baby Hospital,” while extending women’s health care through the latest technologies and therapies.
New York Methodist Hospital continued to develop and offer a range of state-of-the-art medical services, including advanced laparoscopic surgery, deep brain stimulation (to treat Parkinson’s Disease and other conditions) and IMRT, one of the most advanced forms of radiation therapy against cancer tumors.
One of the new century’s most noteworthy events for the Hospital was the opening in April 2004 of the New York Methodist-Cornell Heart Center which brought to Brooklyn a patient-centered, state-of-the-art cardiac surgery center staffed with a top-rated surgical team from the Weill Cornell Medical Center. The new Center was developed after New York State selected NYM to create a comprehensive heart surgery program for the borough of Brooklyn. It is only the third such center in Brooklyn and was approved by the State following a highly competitive process. The Center opened with two cardiac surgery rooms, eight-bed cardiac intensive care unit, and patient and family waiting areas.
In 2007, NYM completed work on a new seven-story patient care pavilion that provides space for a greatly enlarged Emergency Department (including a separate pediatric emergency room), an updated pediatrics unit and four spacious and modern medical/surgical units. NYM also unveiled the Advanced Women’s Imaging and Prenatal Testing Center. This new state-of-the-art facility provides a range of sophisticated prenatal testing options for pregnant women, including laboratory tests and ultrasound tests. The center also offers services and diagnostic examinations focused on prevention and early detection of breast and gynecologic diseases, including breast mammography and ultrasound, gynecological ultrasound and bone densitometry. The Hospital’s physician offices at One Prospect Park West also made their debut in 2009. The construction of the new site allowed NYM to expand services in urology, pediatrics, podiatry and orthopedics, and wound care.
The second decade of the 21st century is off to an equally impressive start, with the opening of coordinated, comprehensive programs for the diagnosis and treatment of liver, breast, prostate and lung cancers; expansion of interventional pulmonology and radiology services, and broadening services for patients with Parkinson’s disease, liver and digestive disorders, and chronic back and neck pain. In 2010, robot-assisted surgery debuted as a program of the Hospital’s Institute for Advanced and Minimally Invasive Surgery and in 2011; NYM was named an Epicenter for Robotic Thoracic Surgery—the first in the Northeast and only the third in the United States.
Brooklyn is forever growing, and New York Methodist Hospital is poised to meet the ever-changing needs of its community. Through specialized institutes, cutting-edge treatment and award winning care, NYM continues to fulfill the founding mission of Reverend James Monroe Buckley, to provide excellent health care services in a compassionate and humane manner for the people who live and work in Brooklyn and its surrounding areas.

Enrico Tamberlik

Enrico Tamberlik (16 March 1820 - 13 March 1889) was an Italian tenor who sang to great acclaim at Europe and America's leading opera venues. He excelled in the heroic roles of the Italian and French repertories and was renowned for his powerful declamation and clarion high notes.
Career.
Born in Rome, some sources claim that Tamberlik might have been of Romanian descent and that his real name was Nikita Torna. Nonetheless, his vocal training was entirely Italian. He studied first in Naples with Zirilli and Borgna, then in Bologna with Guglielmi, and finally in Milan with De Abella. 
The budding "tenore robusto" made his debut in concert in 1837 and later graced the operatic stage for the first time at the Teatro Apollo in Rome, as Gennaro in "Lucrezia Borgia" and as Arnoldo in "Guglielmo Tell". He subsequently appeared at the Teatro Fondo in Naples in 1841, under the name Enrico Danieli, as Tybalt in "I Capuleti e i Montecchi", and during the 1842-43 season, made his debut at the Teatro San Carlo, under the name Enrico Tamberlik (which he used henceforth). He appeared, too, in Madrid and Barcelona.
In 1850, Tamberlik debuted at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, as Masaniello in "La muette de Portici". He was to appear regularly at Covent Garden until 1870, enjoying star billing each time. Tamberlik sang often at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg from 1850 until 1863, creating the role of Alvaro in Verdi's "La forza del destino" on 10 November 1862. He
made his initial guest appearance at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris in 1858, returning there many times until 1877. 
Tamberlik portrayed Alfredo in "La traviata" to the Violetta of Sofia Vera Lorini for the opening of the original Teatro Colón opera house in Buenos Aires in 1857. He also appeared in North America, singing at the Academy of Music in New York City during the 1873-74 season. He last singing engagements in London were at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1877. He toured Spain again in 1881 and retired from the operatic stage shortly afterwards. Tamberlik's death occurred in Paris, three days before his 69th birthday.
Vocal Characteristics and repertoire.
Tamberlik succeeded Gaetano Fraschini (1816–1887) as Italy's leading "tenore robusto", and he ranked behind only the more lyrical-voiced Mario as the most celebrated Italian tenor of the middle decades of the 19th century. (Indeed, he and Mario actually sang together in a production of Meyerbeer's "Robert le diable" at Covent Garden.) 
According to contemporary accounts of his singing, Tamberlik possessed a big, incisive voice with a pervasive vibrato (for which he was criticised by some English music critics) and ringing top notes—including a potent top C-sharp delivered in full chest voice. These virile vocal attributes, coupled with an imposing appearance, made him an exceptionally exciting interpreter of dramatic roles, especially such parts as Jean in "Le prophète", Arnoldo in "Guglielmo Tell" and Manrico in "Il trovatore". Other notable roles of his included (Rossini's) Otello, Pollione, Arturo, Ernani, Robert le diable, Faust, Don Ottavio, Florestan, Max, Poliuto and Cellini.
The heroic tenor Francesco Tamagno (1850–1905) was regarded as being Tamberlik's foremost successor. Their careers overlapped slightly and an echo of Tamberlik's voice and style may be preserved in the acoustic recordings that Tamagno made in Italy in 1903-1904 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company.

Northern puffer

Northern puffer, "Sphoeroides maculatus", is a species in the family Tetraodontidae, or pufferfishes. They are commonly called sugar toads in the Chesapeake Bay region, where they are eaten as a delicacy.
Description.
The northern puffer is a club-shaped fish with a gray, brown or olive back and a yellow or white belly. 
Adults have small spines covering the entire body with a tiny beak-like mouth. Its color is poorly defined black/dark green spots and saddles and a yellow to white belly. It has Tiny jet-black pepper spots (about 1 mm in diameter) scattered over most of pigmented surface, particularly evident on cheeks. Lower sides of the body have a row of black, elongate, bar-like markings. A small dorsal fin is set far back near the tail. "Sphoeroides maculatus", like others in the puffer family, "puffs up" into a ball in self-defense by inhaling air or water into a special chamber near its stomach. The northern puffer usually grows to about 8 to 10 inches. 
Habitat.
Efdre
L
The northern puffer inhabits bays, estuaries and protected coastal waters. It lives in temperate climates from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to Newfoundland in Canada.
Is also found in the Mid-Atlantic from spring to fall.
Diet.
The northern puffer feeds primarily on shellfish, and occasionally on finfish. Using its beak-like mouth it can extract shellfish from their shells and sometimes break the shells to obtain a meal.

Little is known about the life cycle of the northern puffer. They spawn from May through August in shallow, nearshore waters. The female lays adhesive eggs that attach to the sandy or muddy bottom, and the male guards the eggs until they hatch.

Democracy 250

Democracy 250 was a yearlong celebration of the birth of parliamentary democracy, the first first elective assembly in Canada (formerly British North America) in 2008.
On October 2, 1758, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly met for the first time in a modest wooden building at the corner of Argyle and Buckingham streets in Halifax. It was an assembly of twenty-two men, who came together to deliberate as a parliament on questions affecting the colony. With voting limited to Protestant, free-land holding males, it was a modest beginning, and their influence with the British-appointed Governor was questionable. It was the first elected assembly of its kind in what eventually became Canada.
Events commemorating the meeting were held throughout Nova Scotia and Canada in 2008.

Daffy Rents

Daffy Rents is a 1966 "Looney Tunes" cartoon featuring Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales.
Synopsis.
Daffy gets called by the aptly named Dr. Ben Crazy (a parody of the then popular Ben Casey) to remove Speedy from his cats-only nursing home. To do his dirty work for him, Daffy uses his robot Herman to catch Speedy. Unfortunately, Herman proves to be no match for the mouse, (and Speedy's rat cousin, Ramon) and both he and Daffy eventually give up. When he tries to get his money after getting rid of Speedy, the temperamental Dr. Crazy throws Daffy through the window and out of the office!
The cartoon then closes with Daffy remarking: "It's a sad state of affairs, when a mouse can make a machine turn a duck into a chicken on account of a rat. What a revolting development!"

Goodbye Luv'

Goodbye Luv' is a compilation album by Dutch girl group Luv' released by CNR/Carrere Records in 1981 after the formation announced its break-up. It features hit singles taken from the studio albums True Luv' and Forever Yours and scored in the charts between 1979 and 1981 (Ooh, Yes I Do, Ann-Maria, One More Little Kissie, My Number One, Tingalingaling).
Album history.
The fact that Luv' disbanded came as no surprise. The real problems started in August 1980 when Patty Brard left the trio. She was replaced by Ria Thielsch who was officially introduced to the public with the release of My Number One which was a big selling single in Benelux. Soon after, the tensions within the group, the hectic schedule of the ladies and Marga Scheide's overwork provoked the end of Luv'. In July 1981, the singers made a farewell performance on the Nederland Muziekland show on Veronica (TV channel) by singing Tingalingaling (which was released as a single). This final broadcast was filmed in Spakenburg. Luv' also appeared at the Efteling theme park during Hitkrant's Zomerspelen (a summer multi-sport event with Dutch celebrities which was organized by Hitkrant, a teen magazine). <br>
Goodbye Luv' was meant to be Luv's farewell to their fans, though the female pop act didn't know at this time, they would made several reunions in the future.

ISelect

iSelect (or iSelectBowie) is a David Bowie compilation CD first released 29 June 2008 in the United Kingdom and Ireland only.
This CD is a collection of personal favourites compiled by Bowie himself and was available exclusively as a free gift with the 29 June edition of British newspaper "The Mail on Sunday".
Bowie avoided the usual greatest hits route and instead compiled a selection of favourite album tracks, including only three singles ("Life on Mars?", "Loving the Alien" and "Time Will Crawl"). In addition, the version of "Time Will Crawl" included on the album is a remix by engineer Mario J McNulty, featuring several newly recorded parts in an effort to revisit some of the material Bowie had released as part of "Never Let Me Down", an album which he had identified himself as being disappointed with.
It is the only release to contain the track "Some Are" which has been unavailable since the mid-1990s deletion of the 1991 edition of Bowie's 1977 album "Low" on which it was included as a bonus track. It also features the medley of "Sweet Thing" and "Candidate", and the reprise of "Sweet Thing" as a single track, rather than being split up by song as it has been released on previous CD versions of "Diamond Dogs".
It also includes a teaser track combining the "Intro" track and "Hang on to Yourself" from "Live Santa Monica '72", an official rerelease of the bootleg album "Santa Monica '72".
Commercial release.
Due to popular demand, Virgin/EMI released the CD in the U.S. and Canada on 14 October 2008. It is identical to the one released by "The Mail on Sunday" except it comes in a standard jewel case and the booklet contains the song-by-song comments that were published in the newspaper. It has also been released as a digital download on iTunes.

<doc id="18235595" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18235595" title="Fender Deluxe Amp">
Fender Deluxe Amp

The Fender Deluxe guitar amplifier was produced by Fender from early 1948 to 1966. It's predecessor was the Fender Model 26 produced from 1946 to 1948.
Tweed Deluxe.
The Fender Deluxe amp of the 1950s was a medium-powered unit designed to let guitarists “hold their own” in a small group. As Blues, Western, and Rockabilly bands began getting louder, the overdriven tone of a cranked-up Deluxe found its way onto countless live and recorded performances. Over the past decades players of every conceivable style have employed this tone machine for its unmistakable rich tube tone.
The earliest version of the Deluxe was the 5A3, and is often referred to as having a TV Front appearance because the wide panels around the grill were like the television sets of the 1950s. This was true also of the smaller Fender Princeton student and studio amp introduced in 1946 and upgraded in 1948. Subsequent versions of the Deluxe were the "wide panel" cabinet design 5B3, 5C3, and 5D3, followed by the "narrow panel" cabinet 5E3. The Deluxe was the most popular of the Tweed amplifiers made by Fender.
It is relatively small in size, having one twelve inch speaker. It has four inputs and two channels. Each channel has a volume control. Both channels share a tone control. The inputs and controls are mounted at the top of the amplifier. It is often referred to as the "Tweed Deluxe" because of its covering - a light brown material which is actually a cotton twill that is often lacquered.
At the time, Leo Fender produced amplifiers with the intention of having the amplifier stay clean even at high volumes. The Tweed Deluxe is not known for producing a clean tone at high volumes, and as such, was regarded as being an intermediate amplifier. Ironically, the saturated tone this amplifier produces at higher volumes is the reason why it is one of the more famous amplifiers Fender ever produced. It is part of the signature tone for many musicians, a few notable examples being Larry Carlton, Don Felder, Billy Gibbons and Neil Young.
Unusually for a Fender amplifier the Deluxe (models 5D3 and 5E3) has both a feedback-less and cathode biased output stage (a distinctive combination it shares with the Vox AC30). Most push-pull Fenders use feedback tapped from the output transformer's speaker winding to enable more headroom before power stage distortion starts, and in the quest for more volume use the more efficient negative voltage biasing (which also runs the power valves at a cooler temperature). These aspects of the circuit make a key contribution to the complex, wild and ragged sound of an overdriven 5E3 Deluxe, especially in comparison to other Fender amplifiers. The earlier 5C3 model did use feedback although it too was cathode biased.
The amplifier has a 5Y3-GT rectifier, 2 6V6-GT power tubes operating in push/pull mode, and a 12AY7 and a 12AX7 in the preamp. The output is rated at about 15 watts.
The Tweed Deluxe is such a seminal amplifier, is so desirable and (in its original form) so expensive, that there are at least 30 or 40 companies out there making clones or variants of it, either as kits or as completed amplifiers.
Brown Deluxe.
Between 1959 and 1961, Fender began redressing several of their existing amp models in a light brown material known as tolex, and moving the control faces from the top-rear of the cabinet to the front. These amps are referred to as the Brown or Brownface Fender amps. The Deluxe was one such model that made this transition in 1961. The circuit was also changed to include a tremolo effect, and the output was increased to around 20 watts. The preamp tube complement was changed to a trio of 12AX7's, and the rectifier was changed to a more potent GZ34 tube. The pair of 6V6GT power tubes remained the same, although the bias structure was changed from cathode to a non-adjustable fixed state. The circuit number was changed to 6G3, and Fender continued to build and dress the Deluxe in these circuits and cosmetics until 1963.
Blackface Deluxe.
Fender again made a change in their amplifier cosmetics between 1963 and 1964. The color of the tolex covering was changed to black, and the control knobs were changed from ones with pointers that indicated the level number labeled on the control face to ones that had the level numbers incorporated upon the knobs themselves. These are referred to as the Blackface amps. The Deluxe was given its new look in 1963, and again, the circuitry was altered to the number AA763, devoting a full 12AX7 to the preamp of the relabeled "Normal" and "Vibrato" channels as well as the oscillator for the tremolo effect, a 12AT7 tube as a phase inverter, and individual Treble and Bass control knobs rather than single tone controls for each channel. The output bias remained fixed, but incorporated a potentiometer to make adjusting the bias simpler. The output was also bumped to 22 watts.
When Fender redressed the Deluxe in 1963, they began producing a spin-off model that included an integrated spring reverb tank, thus giving birth to the Fender Deluxe Reverb. While the Deluxe Reverb continued to prosper for many years into the future, Fender discontinued the base Deluxe model in 1966.
Reissues.
In 2007 - 2011, Fender's Custom Shop division reissued the 5E3 Deluxe in its original tweed cosmetics, dubbed the Fender '57 Deluxe Amp. Handwired point-to-point, this is the first authentic recreation of this amplifier that Fender has done.
In 2012 Fender issued an Artist Signature amplifier based on the 5E3 circuit with the addition of a tremolo effect; the Fender Eric Clapton (or EC) Tremolux.
In 2014 Fender introduced a Head version of the 5E3 Deluxe to the Custom Shop lineup, dubbed the Fender '57 Deluxe Head.

7th Light Cavalry

The 7th Light Cavalry previously the 28th Light Cavalry, was a regular army cavalry regiment in the British Indian Army which first came into British service with the East India Company and went on to serve on the North West Frontier and in World War I and World War II.
Formation.
The history of this regiment can be traced to 1784 when they had been hired from the Nawab of Arcot by the East India Company, when these regiments mutinied for lack of pay John Company was forced to quell the mutiny. The regiments involved were disbanded and from the remnants, volunteers formed the 2nd Madras Cavalry which would eventually become the 7th Light Cavalry.
They soon changed their title to the 3rd Madras Native Cavalry and it was under that title that they were first in action during the Third Mysore War in 1790 against Tipu Sultan.
They were next in action during the Fourth Mysore War in 1799 and fought with distinction at the Battle of Seringapatam and at the Battle of Mahidpur in the Pindari War of 1817, after which they became known as the 3rd Madras Light Cavalry.
For these actions they were awarded the battle honors "Mysore", "Seringapatam" and "Mahidipore".
Apart from some minor operations against the southern Mahrattas from 1844 to 1855 and sending some troops to join the Decan force during the Mutiny of 1857, the regiment would not see any action for the next hundred years.
In 1891 they were converted to lancers becoming the 3rd Regiment of Madras Lancers and in the reorganisation of the Indian Army in 1903, their title was changed to the 28th Light Cavalry.
World War I.
At the start of World War I, the Regiment was stationed in Quetta being part of the 4th (Quetta) Division.
In July 1915 two squadrons were sent to Persia where they were mounted on camels they were tasked with stopping German agents from traveling across Persia to Afghanistan.The remainder of the regiment joined in November 1915.
The Regiments success in Persia was demonstrated when they captured a German officer, Lieutenant Winkleman, who was attempting to reach the Amir of Afghanistan to convince him to rebel or start a Jihad, against the British in India.
Russia.
Following the Russian Revolution the Regiment was sent to Trans Caspasia in May 1918 to assist the anti-revolutionary Mensheviks forces to fight the Bolsheviks. In April 1919 the regiment moved back to Meshed in Persia where it stayed fro seven months employed escorting convoys. In November 1919 the regiment started back for India and reached Lucknow in February 1920.
The regiment received the battle honors "Merv" and "Persia 1915" for their services in the Great War.
Between the Wars.
In 1921 the regiment left Lucknow for Dera Ismail Khan on the North West Frontier. From 1924 to 1929 it was stationed at Bolarum, followed by Sialkot then Jullunder until October 1933 when it moved to Loralai in Baluchistan. It stayed here until October 1935 when it moved back to Bolarum where it was at the start of World War 2.
In 1922 another reorganization saw the regiment renamed as the 7th Light Cavalry and the class composition was altered.
The same year the ‘Indianization’ of the Indian Army officer corps began in selected regiments. Initially in the cavalry the two unit's selected where the 7th Light Cavalry and the 16th Light Cavalry. The policy was such where by British officers would no longer be appointed to the regiment but Indians, initially trained at Royal Military College, Sandhurst and from 1932 onwards at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun would be appointed instead. The first such officer was appointed in December 1923. By September 1939 of the 22 officers on the books of the regiment, 16 were Indian.
World War II.
At the start of the Second World War the Regiment was stationed in Bolarum part of the 4th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade they were brigaded with the:
The last mounted parade took place in 1940 but by early 1941 the only mechanical transport the regiment possessed were an Austin Car for the commandant and a few motorbikes for dispatch riders. Vehicles trickled in and finally a full complement of 52 Stuart tanks was received by April 1943.
The regiment was attached to the 254th Indian Tank Brigade, in November 1941. 
The major units of the Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Reginald Scoones, consisted, when it moved to Imphal in November and December 1943, of the:
The Brigade fought with the 5th Indian Division and the 7th Indian Infantry Divisions in Burma and was involved in the Battle of Imphal, Battle of Kyaukmaung Bridgehead, Battle of Meiktila, and the Rangoon Road.
In June 1945 the 7th Light Cavalry sailed from Rangoon to Madras and by July was at Ahmednagar.
In August 1945 it was selected to form part of the British Indian Division (BRINDIV) which was to form part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces (BCOF) as part of the Allied Occupation Forces in Japan. The move to Japan occurred in March/April 1946. They returned to India in August 1947.
Post war.
In 1947 the regiment passed to the independent nation of India. From late 1947 it played a key role in the Jammu & Kashmir operations, most notably the surmounting of Zojila and the break through on 1 November 1948.
Victoria Cross.
L/Daffadar Gobind Singh, 28th Light Cavalry February 1, 1917
Place of Action: east of Peizieres, France attached to the 2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)
Citation:Lance Dafadar Gobind Singh of Indian Cavalry was awarded the Victoria Cross "for most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on the 1st February 1917, east of Pozieres, France, in thrice volunteering to carry messages between the regiment and Brigade Headquarters, a distance of 1½ miles over open ground which was under the observation and heavy fire of the enemy. He succeeded each time in delivering the message, although on each occasion his horse was shot and he was compelled to finish his journey on foot." 
Uniforms and insignia.
During the early years of its existence the regiment wore red coats with green facings and gold lace. In 1814 the uniform was changed to dark blue with orange facings. In 1817 a general order instructed that the dress of all regular native cavalry in the service of the HEIC should be changed to French grey (a light blue/grey colour). This was to remain the full dress coat colour of the 7th Light Cavalry until 1914. The distinctive orange facings were changed to buff in 1846. 
In 1923 the pattern of badge introduced comprised crossed lances with the number "7", surmounted by a crown. In 1930 the design changed to crossed lances with a crown on the intersection, over a scroll with the regimental title.

Charter Oak Schoolhouse

The Charter Oak Schoolhouse is a historic octagonal school building in Schuline, Illinois, located on the Evansville/Schuline Road between Schuline and Walsh. Built in 1873, it served as a public primary school until 1953. The school was one of 53 octagonal schoolhouses built in the United States, of which only three survive. The building is now used as a museum by the Randolph County Historical Society and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Architecture.
The one-room schoolhouse is a one-story building with an octagonal plan. The building's foundation is made of locally quarried limestone, while the building's walls were built with red brick. A louvered belfry, which may not have been added until 1883, tops the building's low-sloping roof. Courses of corbelled brick along the roof line form the building's cornice. The vestibule at the school's entrance is sided with clapboard and rests on a concrete foundation. 53 octagonal schoolhouses were built in the United States, of which the school was the only one built in Illinois. The school is one of three of these octagonal schoolhouses which is still standing.
History.
Built in 1873, the Charter Oak Schoolhouse was the third public school built at its location. The first school building was a simple log structure built in 1848. The second school building, a frame structure constructed in 1863, was destroyed by a tornado, necessitating the construction of a new building. Contractor William H. Holcomb constructed the third building at a cost of $1000. The school's teacher, Daniel Ling, proposed the construction of an octagonal building, which he believed would allow more light into the classroom and be more likely to survive severe winds. In addition to classes, the school building also hosted local meetings, competitions, and political events during its tenure as a school. The school closed in 1953, as did all other one-room schoolhouses in the area. The Randolph County Historical Society purchased the building in 1960 and subsequently restored it and converted it to an interpretive center of the history of the one-room schoolhouse. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 11, 1978.

Glenn Ryle

Glenn Ryle Schnitker was a long-time television personality, announcer and children's show host in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Early life.
Ryle attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati during World War II. A member of the class of 1945, he became a member of the second of five chapters of the Cincinnati-based Fraternity Triginta Optimi. At age 17, Ryle left school to enter military service with the United States Marines. At one point in his service career he briefly participated in a War Bond drive with war hero Pappy Boyington [http://www.cetconnect.org/broadcastpioneers/personalities.asp?idv=102]. 
Following his discharge, Ryle was a civilian advisor for the Israeli military in the Middle East during the time when this territory was being created. In June 1950 Ryle was recalled to active duty with the start of hostilities in the Korean War. He served in Korea just over a year.
Radio & Television Career.
On advice from a friend in Huntington, WV, Ryle, against his own better judgment and with no prior experience or training, became involved in broadcasting and joined WMOH radio in Hamilton. His inexperience, and also his potential, caught the attention of Cecil Hale of the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, who took Ryle under his wing, improving his skills. Ryle was later hired briefly by WLWT; his first on-camera commercial was on "Midwestern Hayride" plugging B.C. Headache Powders. His stint at WLWT was very short-lived, and he continued at WMOH until he auditioned for and won a staff announcer position at WCPO-TV, where he performed additional duties including hosting a short-lived kids show (on this show he was a localized version of Captain Midnight); he also hosted a late night movie show, cleaned pianos, and even ran a boom microphone on Paul Dixon's pantomime show. Ryle was released from WCPO after a year and a half, and soon went to work as a writer/producer for the Ralph Jones Advertising Agency. In the fall of 1954 Ryle received a phone call from Paul Shoemaker at WKRC-TV offering Ryle another television job, which he immediately accepted.
At WKRC Ryle reprised most of the duties he had at WCPO—staff announcing and hosting a movie matinee show. A year after hiring on at WKRC he co-created and hosted "The Skipper Ryle Show" and in the 70s hosted the local weeknight version of "Bowling for Dollars". Early in his career Ryle was one of six staff announcers at Channel 12, but ultimately it was Ryle's voice that became synonymous with WKRC, especially its Station IDs and promos; Ryle remained at WKRC for 35 years.
"Skipper Ryle".
In the late winter-early spring of 1956, Ryle was selected by WKRC executives Len Goorian and David Taft to host a children's show consisting mostly of cartoons. Ryle initially declined, but with Daylight Savings Time leaving an empty hour on the station's schedule, Ryle was given the option of either hosting the show or being released. Ryle changed his mind and agreed to host the show, which was initially going to be called "Hi, Kids!", but when Ryle's military experience began kicking in, and when he started adding messages about river and boat safety, Ryle and others involved in production of the show decided to go with a riverboat setting for the show itself which, with Cincinnati being right on the Ohio River, turned out to be a perfect fit. Then someone suggested the nickname "Skipper", which Ryle liked, and thus the name of the show was changed.
"The Skipper Ryle Show" became an unexpected hit and ultimately enjoyed a seventeen-year run on WKRC. Initially an hour-long Saturday morning show, it later moved to Sundays for two hours, and later still became a weekday series. At its peak the show was second only to WCPO's "Uncle Al Show" in popularity among kids. Its immediate success came as a surprise to WKRC management and even Ryle himself. But like Uncle Al, Ryle never treated his success as accidental. 
Part of the show's wider appeal was that Ryle never played to just the children. A major facet of the show's success was that Ryle was never condescending in his talks with the kids who appeared on the show. Despite the fact that his own personal primary demographic was kids who had felt they had outgrown Uncle Al, Ryle tried to, as he once put it, "open the whole thing up to everybody", young and old alike. Colleague Nick Clooney and other local critics once regarded "Skipper Ryle" as the most civilized children's show on television. 
In the show's earlier years, Ryle donned a Naval peacoat and matching peaked cap with a gray wig and bushy mustache, adopting an "old man of the sea" motif, but the wig and mustache were soon abandoned; by 1960 Ryle had grown a real mustache of his own. Ryle later incorporated as the show's theme the rousing seafaring song "Blow High, Blow Low" from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical "Carousel".
Skipper Ryle became so popular that he made in-person appearances at local amusement parks like Coney Island, LeSourdsville Lake, and even at the Cincinnati Zoo; thousands of kids and their families would come to see Skipper Ryle in person. In a 1990 interview Ryle related that he was informed of an estimated 26,000 people who had shown up to see him perform a 1965 show at the Cincinnati Zoo. Concession stands were rapidly running out of food and traffic around the zoo was badly jammed with people still trying to get in; eventually radio stations went on the air asking people to avoid the area around the zoo.
In the early 70s, Ryle, in an attempt to compete with rival WXIX's Sunday morning powerhouse "Wonderama", hosted a limited-run weekend series called the "Skipper Ryle Special", featuring a live audience, games and guest stars; over the years Ryle gave away countless prizes from Cincinnati-based Kenner Toys. 
By 1973, though the show was still very popular, WKRC executives, citing increasing expense, decided to cancel production of the show.
Personal life.
Ryle's wife, Jacqueline, was a Cincinnati native; they had two children, Steve and Cheri. Ryle maintained a low profile after his retirement in the late 80s. His final public appearance was an interview by colleague and long-time friend Nick Clooney at WCET in the fall of 1990. He died in 1993.

AnyKode Marilou

anyKode Marilou is a modeling and simulation environment for mobile robots, humanoids, articulated arms and parallels robots operating in real-world conditions that respect the laws of physics. This robotics suite is used in research centers as well as industry for various projects like humanoid architectures, wheeled and multi legged vehicles and multi-robot systems (Multi-agents).
Marilou real-time engine uses the ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) for collisions detecting and dynamics management. Various 'real world' variables like forces, torques, masses, damping, friction and others can be adjusted directly to the objects surfaces.
Scenes modeling.
Entities editor allows to design robots collision model by using any of the static or dynamic objects in the simulated world. CAD-style editing tools are entirely graphical.
Scenes, dynamics and robots properties can be changed from a view/document/properties IHM style. Also the editor takes in charge re-usable physicals entities as well as pure 3D models.
Marilou uses a hierarchical system to present entire objects at the highest level (the current world). This approach makes it possible to reuse members of a complex object as sub-parts of another object.
Devices.
Marilou includes a complete set of user-modifiable virtual devices. The behavior of these devices may be overridden by the properties of real devices available in robotics. This feature allows the programmer to use a known device's parameters directly. 
This is a list of supported devices types:
Robots programming.
MODA (Marilou Open Devices Access) is the Marilou generic SDK for handling simulated robots and their embedded devices, such as sensors and actuators. Depending on chosen language, MODA provides libraries (.lib / .a) or .Net assembly (.dll) for accessing simulation over the network. Synchronized to a simulated clock, algorithms can run on any computer in the network. Individual robots may run several programs. In addition, one MODA program can control several robots, whether or not they be in the same world. MODA TCP server can be embedded in real robot.

Attaxe (band)

Attaxe was an American thrash metal band from California. The band played extensively in Southern California and the Bay Area through the early nineties headlining smaller clubs and as opening act for such notable thrash/metal bands as Anthrax, Testament, Metal Church, Danzig, King Diamond, Sacred Reich, Meliah Rage and Vio-Lence. Attaxe was invited by Vio-lence to be an opening act on the infamous "Opressing The Masses" album release show in June 1990 at the Omni in Oakland, CA. 
Attaxe was featured on the premiere issue No. 1 of the video magazine "Tales From The Pit"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UROsuqXFPg0] released in 1990. According to TFTP creator Jerry Allen in 2008 "Attaxe (this line up(1990)) was definitely our favorite unsigned band from back in the day. Although a SOCAL band, they sounded more like Bay Area Thrash in the same league as Vio-lence and Testament. These guys should have been huge in our opinion. We still play their Lethal Deception demo to this day. Skelly was definitely one of the best frontmen we've seen. Too bad this band didn't do more. The video we filmed was for Tales From The Pit No. 1. It was recorded shortly before the band's Lethal Deception demo came out. The audio is from a live Hollywood metal show and is a mono board recording. Even with its limitations, the live audio shows what a vicious band they were out of the studio. I prefer this live version of "Living in Fear" over the polished demo version. It's way more raw and ripping. Would love to see a reunion." 
The band officially disbanded in 1994.
In 2009 Attaxe members Bonaventura, Cason, Houle and May re-grouped and began writing new material.
History.
Original lineup.
Attaxe was formed in the Orange County, California area in 1985 by guitarists Mike Bonaventura & Todd May and drummer Jim Houle. The band soon recruited bassist Gary Sebourn and vocalist Michael Whyte and played their first show on December 6, 1986, at "Big John's Billiards" in Fullerton, California.
Changes in formation.
The core of the band (Bonaventura, Houle, May) stayed the same throughout most of its history, however there were four different vocalists which provided a distinctly different sound and style. Three of the four were recorded as follows:

Attaxe had several lineup changes with Mike Bonaventura and Jim Houle being the only constant members.

Sekolah Menengah Sains Muzaffar Syah

Sekolah Menengah Sains Muzaffar Syah () or MOZAC is the only science school and one of the two fully residential schools (Sekolah Berasrama Penuh) in the state of Malacca, Malaysia. Established in 1973 under the Second Malaysia Plan, it is the first boarding school in Malacca. The school is widely known as MOZAC and the students bears the name Muzaffarians. In 2010, the school was awarded with the Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi or High Performance School, a title awarded to the 20 schools in Malaysia that have met stringent criteria including academic achievement, strength of alumni, international recognition, network and linkages. The school is specialized in green technology, agriculture, robotics and electronics. Its performance in the 2013 Penilaian Menengah Rendah examination was the best in Melaka with GPS 1.04 (104 from 135 students gaining straight A's). Most of the students became engineers and doctors.
History.
The school was established in 1973 under the Second Malaysia Plan. It was built on the top of a hilly area in Ayer Keroh, Malacca, at 121.9 meters above sea level and in an area encompassing 12.9 hectare. The buildings were completed in 1976. It was officially opened by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Melaka in 1983 as Sekolah Menengah Sains Melaka.
The first batch consisted of 120 Form 1 students and 160 Form 4 students who started on 5 January 1973 at a temporary location, Sekolah Menengah Munsyi Abdullah. The students were then transferred to Sekolah Menengah Sains Johor, Kluang, Johor because the buildings in Ayer Keroh were not completed. At first, the school had 22 classes, office, library, staff room, language lab, media room, counselling room, koperasi, living skills workshop for Ekonomi Rumah Tangga (ERT) and Kemahiran Manipulatif Tambahan (KMT), dentist room, sick bay, hostel office and others. In 2001, Al-Abrar surau was built and officially opened by Yang di-Pertua Negeri Melaka as well as the construction of spotlights in the school, hostel and field. The school was provided with free Wi-Fi service by the Melaka government to encourage the spread of information and communications technology (ICT) among students.
In 1976, the school was entrusted by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia to conduct its matriculation course. The matriculation courses were carried out for SPM school leavers who wanted to pursue their studies in the university's Faculty of Medicine. The first batch of matriculation consisted of 102 students from all over the country.
The name Sekolah Menengah Sains Melaka was changed to Sekolah Menengah Sains Muzaffar Syah in October 1983, a denomination given after the fourth Sultan of Melaka Sultanate, Muzaffar Shah of Malacca. Muzaffar also means 'winning' in Arabic. In 1998, the school was grouped as one of the 88 Smart Schools in Malaysia.
In 2007, MOZAC field was utilized as the training ground for the winning Manchester United during 2007 Champions Youth Cup and was upgraded. A landslide, however, occurred later that year. Most of the upper side of the field was severely affected, causing the field to lose it firmness. In 2008, the school was granted the title Cluster School followed by the prestigious High Performance School in 2010. Infrastructure-wise, the school is awaiting for the completion of a new hostel building which is due in 2014. 
MOZAC acronym.
Sekolah Menengah Sains Muzaffar Syah is renowned for its catchy acronym, MOZAC. The history goes back to 1999 when the school was acknowledged as the best in the country based on the 1998 SPM results. The current Prime Minister of Malaysia, then Education Minister, Dato' Seri Haji Mohamad Najib Razak, flew by a chopper and landed on the school field to announce the news. Due to the performance that year, the school was promoted to change its given name to Muzzafar College, which serves as the basis for the acronym MOZAC. Due to the fact that it is the only science school in Melaka, the State Education Department objected to the name change. Even though the name was not changed, the acronym remains widely used.
Student life.
There are seven student bodies in MOZAC. There are Prefects' Board, Missionary and Spiritual Board (BADRI), House's System Board, Librarian Board, KOSMOZ Board and Peer Counselors (PRS). The leaders of BADRI and House's system are included under Prefects Board as they are influential bodies in the school, below the prefects.
There are four houses in MOZAC: Bendahara (Yellow), Syahbandar (Green), Temenggung (Red) and Laksamana (Blue). Previously, before the school being renamed, the school house were named as Beta, Omega, Sigma and Alpha.
The sports that are famous in MOZAC is rugby (MOZAC DRAGON), basketball (MOZAC KNIGHTS), softball, volleyball, netball, and football. Others sports played by the students include hockey [ (MOHOC)], sepak takraw and badminton. The uniform bodies is all-boys Persatuan Kadet Bersatu Malaysia (PKBM), all-girls Persatuan Puteri Islam (PPI), Kadet Remaja Sekolah Malaysia (KRS), Air Scouts, Kadet Jabatan Pertahanan Awam Malaysia (KAPA), Malaysian Red Crescent Society (PBSM) and Wind Orchestra (WO).
The niche area of MOZAC is Research and Development (R&D). Earlier, when it received Cluster School status, there were three niche areas: k-teroka (R & D), e-Mozac (ICT) and e-Tinta (Writing). The three were combined to a single R&D in 2012. In recent years, MOZAC has been known for pioneering other schools in this area. In 2009, the school produced its own thumb drive called i-Mozac (not to be confused with Apple's products). The lamp in the school is fully use LED assembled by the students. Then, it is known for its robotics and F1 in Schools program. Recently, the school started to do research involving the-potential of green technology.
The school WO team made it to the Wind Orchestra Finale in 2002 and 2003. The best conductor award was given to the school in 2002 and fourth out of eight team in 2003.

Modern allegorism

Modern Allegorism is a school of fine art in which the artist uses contemporary elements in an allegorical style to communicate a positive and uplifting message to the viewer.
The term was first used in print in a book published in 2007 titled "Tarnowski: Modern Allegories" about the work of artist Glen Tarnowski. Tarnowski coined the term to describe artwork that communicated to a modern world in the same way that Renaissance artists communicated values, ethics and morality to the largely illiterate population of the time.
The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and paradoxical. These subgenres describe the mechanism through which the artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion to encourage the viewer to question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt to inspire the viewer to believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements in ways that are contrary to the viewer's expectation in order to encourage the viewer to evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.

It is responsible for protecting all facilities and surrounding area owned by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, for enforcing state and city laws at all the facilities and the surrounding area, and for many non law enforcement duties, including collecting the tolls, towing disabled and wrecked vehicles off of the roadways, and clearing snow off the roadways. The TBTA currently has 966 Bridge and Tunnel Officers, Sergeants, Lieutenants and Captains.
The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is a transportation and toll collection agency with many divisions.
The Operations Force (law enforcement division) is not part of the MTA Police. Bridge and Tunnel Officers are the policing authority of the TBTA.
Ranks.
There are five sworn titles (referred to as ranks) for the TBTA Operations Force:
Facilities.
Currently, the TBTA has personnel at all nine bridges and tunnels operated by the TBTA.
The bridges and tunnels are:
Power and authority.
Sworn personnel are New York State Peace Officers authorized to execute warrantless arrests, perform car stops, issue summonses, carry a firearm and use physical and deadly force. The Geographical Area of Employment for sworn personnel is the City of New York.
Units.
Currently, the TBTA has the following units:
The Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Unit was formed in 2008 with five officers and three sergeants currently assigned. The unit enforces all weight, hazardous material, cargo, and other restrictions set by NYS law and TBTA rules and regulations.
ACROBAT.
The Achieving Collision Reduction on Bridges and Tunnels (ACROBAT) program was created to track and prevent auto accidents on the bridges and tunnels. This program also keeps statistics on summonses issued on bridges and tunnels, and what the charges were for.
Toll collection and non law enforcement duties.
Currently, Officers collect tolls at all facilities. (temporary toll collectors are hired on a 1 year basis, and are usually rehired at the completion of 1 year). Temporary toll collectors have no law enforcement status and their sole responsibility is the collection of tolls.
Many Officers, if not most, depending on seniority and the facility, do not collect tolls.
Officers operate wreckers to remove disabled vehicles from the roadways and also perform firefighting and emergency rescue operations at the scene of an accident or fire. Bridge and Tunnel Officers only operate wreckers on weekends & holidays at the bridges, during the week bridge and tunnel maintainers operate the wreckers. Officers operate the wreckers full time at the tunnel facilities. During snow storms they may be required to assist in the removal of snow off the roadways.
Training.
Recruit Officers attend the MTA Bridges and Tunnels training academy located on Randalls Island for 12 weeks. Recruits are trained in the use of a Glock 26 & 19 and receive training in accordance with New York State Municipal Police Training Council (MPTC) standards, New York City Fire Department training, NIMS training, Recognizing and Dealing with Weapons of Mass Destruction training, Radiation Detector training, American Red Cross First Aid/CPR training and MTA Bridges & Tunnels Training Academy. All sworn personnel receive annual in-service training in all topics, including, but not limited to: deadly physical force, firearms requalification, self defense, arrest procedures and techniques, CPR/AED/first aid and all relevant updates regarding state, city and local laws.
Equipment.
BTOs are equipped with a firearm, expandable baton, can of pepper spray, handcuffs, whistle, flashlight, reflective traffic vest, bullet resistant vest, radiation detector, and a radio that is directly linked to the Central Dispatcher and other officers.
Currently, all officers are equipped with a Glock 19 9mm service weapon, and the Glock 26 9mm is authorized for off-duty use.
The force uses 9C1 police package Chevrolet Impalas for patrol and Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and Chevrolet Suburbans for Highway Patrol/SOD.
September 11th attacks and change of the department.
Prior to the September 11th attacks, BTOs were unarmed unless they were the desk officer, a supervisor, making an arrest, or transporting revenue money. The reason for officers being unarmed was due to customer service concerns. A BTO's main responsibility was toll collection, with limited law enforcement tasks. BTOs mainly stood foot posts on the plaza, and RMP patrols were limited.
Since September 11, the TBTA force's responsibilities and operation has increased dramatically. All officers, sergeants, lieutenants and captains are now armed at all times and the force is proactive in law enforcement responsibilities. The formation of several units also took place over this time, and many new law enforcement posts were created for day to day operations.
Possible merger into MTA Police.
Because the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is a part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, there has been discussion around incorporating the BTOs into the MTA Police. In the original draft of the creation of the consolidated MTA Police Department, the agencies that were originally to be merged were the Long Island Rail Road Police, Metro North Police, Staten Island Rapid Transit Police, and TBTA. TBTA officers were then removed due to issues in training, seniority and the completion of a NYS Police refresher course. BTOBA voted down any merger with the MTA Police. In 1998 the MTA Police Department was created by combining the Long Island Rail Road Police and Metro North Police. On July 1, 2005, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Police was absorbed into the MTA Police.

Bruce Dickinson discography

Bruce Dickinson, a British heavy metal singer, has released six studio albums, two live albums, one compilations, one EP, ten singles, three video albums, fourteen music videos, and one box set. In 1979, after playing in local groups, Dickinson joined hard rock band Samson. He departed after two years to become Iron Maiden's lead vocalist. His debut with this band is considered a "masterpiece", which was followed with a series of top-ten releases. In 1989, while Iron Maiden were taking a year off, Dickinson and former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, composed a song for . His solo debut, "Tattooed Millionaire" (1990), was an effort that favoured a hard rock/pop metal approach, different from what fans assumed would be an aggressive, Iron Maiden-like album. Four songs—the title track, "Dive! Dive! Dive!", "Born in '58", and a cover version of David Bowie's "All the Young Dudes"—were released as singles. Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden, accompanied by Gers as the new guitarist, and the project went on hiatus. "Dive! Dive! Live!" was a live video recorded from a concert in Los Angeles, California, in August 1990, and released in July 1991.
After a farewell tour in 1993, Dickinson left Iron Maiden and started working on a second album with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist and band leader, Roy Z. In June 1994, he released "Balls to Picasso", which reached the top 30 in several countries. Allmusic deemed the album "somewhat of a disappointment" which failed to "come up with anything truly groundbreaking", except for "Tears of the Dragon", which was released as a single, along with "Shoot All the Clowns". Roy Z departed to continue with his work and Dickinson recruited new members, with whom he released the double-disc live performance, "Alive in Studio A". The third album, "Skunkworks", was released in 1996, marking a "highly approved stylistic shift". The single "Back from the Edge" was released to promote this effort. A live video and an EP were recorded from a concert in Spain, and released in Japan, as "Skunkworks Live".
Due to musical differences, the Skunkworks line-up split up, and Dickinson once again was joined by Roy Z, along with then ex-Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith. The follow-up album, "Accident of Birth" (1997), marked a return to a heavier sound for Dickinson. The title track and "Man of Sorrows" were released as singles. The next year he released a semi-concept album on alchemy, "The Chemical Wedding", which was described as a "modern metal aesthetic". The "muscular anthem", "Killing Floor", was the album's single. The live album, "Scream for Me Brazil", documented a 1999 live performance in São Paulo during the supporting tour. That year, Dickinson and Smith rejoined Iron Maiden, and the project once again went on hiatus. He released a "best of…" album in 2001, which included two new songs, "Broken" and "Silver Wings". On 23 May 2005, Dickinson released his first album in seven years, "Tyranny of Souls". To commemorate this, all of his past releases were remastered, with his studio efforts containing bonus tracks, and the live recordings merged into a single box set, entitled "Alive". The 2006 DVD, "Anthology", contained three live performances, all of the promo videos, and over an hour of extras.

Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels

Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Plc, operator of the Millennium, Copthorne, and Kingsgate hotel chains, is a leading British-based company operating globally in the hospitality industry. Including the pipeline, the company owns or operates over 120 hotels in 19 countries around the world. It is headquartered in London and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
History.
The company's origins go back to 1972 when British Caledonian Airways acquired the Copthorne Hotel at Copthorne, West Sussex, near Gatwick. The Copthorne Hotels brand was launched in 1985 and a number of new hotels opened in the UK, France and Germany. In 1989 Singapore based CDL Hotels International acquired 6 hotels in Asia and in 1993 CDL made its first move outside Asia – purchasing the 548-room Gloucester Hotel in London. In the same year CDL took control of a 13-hotel chain in New Zealand. In 1994 CDL made its entry into the US with the purchase of the Millenium Hilton in New York and acquired the Millennium Broadway in New York’s Times Square district in December. In 1995 Copthorne Hotels was acquired by CDL Hotels and the enlarged concern became Millennium and Copthorne Hotels. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. In 1999 it acquired Regal Hotels of the US.
In 2001 M&C expanded into the Middle East with several management contracts secured in the United Arab Emirates and the first of six new hotels in China opened in 2008.
Operations.
The group is structured as follows:
List of Hotels.
Kingsgate Hotel.
Middle East.
In January 2009 the group announced it would open two hotels in Liverpool Central Village development.
Ownership.
The firm is controlled with a 53% stake by Singaporean investment company City Developments Limited.
Controversy.
The Millennium brand of hotels has come under fire for charging high rates for rooms that are outdated and in disrepair. While many travel and review sites offer poor feedback from their stays at Millenium Hotels, for the first time city leaders are also demanding the hotel group update or demolish their buildings. City of Cincinnati economic development director Odis Jones went so far as saying “The Millennium is in poor shape. It needs more than just a renovation.” The St. Louis hotel has fared no better with customers. "I've never experienced a hotel that was so, not just filthy, but also dilapidated", one St. Louis Millennium visitor claimed. St. Louis leaders demanded that the Millennium do something about their hotel, which resulted in a massive ongoing renovation. The Millennium Minneapolis recently reopened after undergoing a much needed $22-million dollar renovation.

Alfred Aboya

Alfred Aboya Baliaba (born 2 January 1985) is a Cameroonian professional basketball player who last played for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, advancing to three Final Fours. He was a member of the winningest class in UCLA history with 123 wins.
Aboya grew up and attended high school in Cameroon before attending prep school in the United States. He attended college at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned his undergraduate degree in three years while playing four season for the Bruins. Aboya began his professional career in France, followed by Japan, Venezuela, and Turkey before returning to Japan.
Early life.
Aboya was born in Yaoundé, Cameroon to his mother, Kedi Kofane Angele, and his father, Baliaba Aboya Casimir.
He graduated from high school in Cameroon and then attended prep school at Tilton School in Tilton, New Hampshire. He was recruited by Tilton coach Scott Willard, who had only seen a picture of Aboya soaring for a slam dunk. The school was looking to grow its international student population, and it was developing an English as a Second Language program. Tilton had never had any students from Africa, while Aboya spoke a couple of languages—none of them English—and he was a star in two sports including basketball. Though he had already graduated from high school, Aboya was willing to sacrifice two years at Tilton as a path toward an American university education.
He was a raw player when he began at Tilton. He became a dominant center by his senior year, and he drew attention from colleges like Georgetown and UCLA. On a visit to the West Coast, Aboya became friends with Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who grew up near him in Yaoundé.
College career.
Joined by Mbah a Moute, Aboya began attending UCLA in the fall of 2005. The two teammates relied on each other for support. UCLA advanced to the Final Four in each of Aboya's first three seasons. In his freshman year, he was originally set to be a starter until he had arthroscopic surgery on both knees, delaying his debut until the seventh game of the season. He played 33 games, starting two, in 2005–06. In his sophomore year, he played in 35 of the Bruins' 36 games, including one start. That season, he had almost as many offensive rebounds (68) as he did defensive rebounds (79). As a junior in 2006–07, Aboya was one of four teammates to play in all 39 games. He made 17 starts, playing 15.2 minutes per game while averaging 2.9 points and 2.2 rebounds. 
In his senior year in 2008–09, UCLA relied on him as a rebounder after Mbah a Moute and Kevin Love had left for the National Basketball Association (NBA). Aboya averaged 9.9 points and 6.3 rebounds a game, both personal bests. He drew praise for his defense, and also developed a jump shot. Aboya and fellow senior teammates Darren Collison and Josh Shipp finished their careers as the winningest class in UCLA history with 123 wins. The distinction was relative, as John Wooden's legendary teams played shorter seasons and freshmen were ineligible.
Academically, Aboya felt he had fallen behind during his two years in prep school. He worked with his academic adviser to earn his undergraduate degree in three years, graduating with a grade point average over 3.0 in international relations. In his fourth year, he began work on his master’s degree in public policy. He aspired to one day become the president of Cameroon.
Professional career.
After going undrafted in the 2009 NBA draft, he joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2009 NBA Summer League. In September 2009, he signed with BCM Gravelines. However, he was released a week later.
In October 2009, he signed with Olympique Antibes of the LNB Pro B, before joining Link Tochigi Brex of the Japan Basketball League (JBL) in January 2010.
In the summer of 2010, he signed with the Hitachi Sunrockers of the JBL for the 2010–11 season.
He signed with Bucaneros de La Guaira of Liga Profesional de Baloncesto for the 2012 season, but he left in February 2012 and in March moved to Final Gençlik of the Turkish Basketball Second League.
He played the 2012–13 season with Shiga Lakestars of Japan before being released in early 2013.
In March 2013, he moved back to Final Gençlik.
On November 1, 2013, he was acquired by the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. On November 22, he was waived by the Mad Ants. On December 20, 2013, he was re-acquired by the Mad Ants. On February 4, 2014, he was again waived by the Mad Ants.

David Andrew Phoenix

David Andrew Phoenix OBE AcSS DSc was born in 1966 in Greater Manchester, England. After attending Turton High school, in Bolton he progressed to study Biochemistry at Liverpool University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. He remained at Liverpool to complete his Doctorate on penicillin binding proteins and after postdoctoral work in England and the Netherlands he began work at the University of Central Lancashire where attained the position of Deputy Vice Chancellor before being appointed as Vice Chancellor and Chief Executive of London South Bank University.
Academic background.
Phoenix read biochemistry and obtained his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Liverpool. This was followed by completion of a Doctorate, again in biochemistry. He continued to study part time and went on to obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Open University which focused on mathematics. Further study generated a Masters in Education and later a Masters in Business Administration. His contribution to the field of biochemistry was rewarded by the presentation of the degree of Doctor of Science from Liverpool University. This higher doctorate recognised his work into the importance of amphiphilicity in the localisation and function of bioactive molecules.
He has published widely on the structure-function relationship of amphiphilic biomolecules, obtaining a Chair in Biochemistry in 2000. He has held Visiting Chairs in Russia, China and Canada. In addition to peer reviewed papers, edited collections and research monographs he has also been recognised for publication of undergraduate textbooks. He continues to sit on editorial boards and editorial advisory boards for approximately ten international scientific journals and has also been Editor in Chief of The Journal of Biological Education and of periodicals such as Biologist which are aimed at a broader readership.
Research.
The group is multidisciplinary and draws on a range of specialisms including, biology, chemistry,  physics and computational modelling to help develop understanding of the structure function relationships utilised by amphiphilic bioactive molecules. The term ‘‘peptide-amphiphile’’ can be used to describe amphiphilic peptides consisting only of amino acids that show segregation of charged and uncharged components within the primary or secondary structure. Alternatively they may be composed of hydrophilic peptides linked to hydrophobic alkyl chains or lipids, and peptide based copolymers. Such molecules are of significant biological importance due to the range of asymmetric boundaries that occur in nature such as those found at a membrane lipid interface. Amphiphilic protein sequences can be involved in protein targeting, membrane protein assembly as well as membrane fusion and lysis. In addition to amphiphilic peptides possessing key biological functions amphiphiles are becoming of increasing interest in the creation of new biomaterials. Amphiphiles can self-assemble into a variety of different structures such as micelles, vesicles, monolayers, bilayers, nanofibers, nanotapes, ribbons, and twisted ribbons, to minimize unfavorable interactions with their surroundings. A key aspect of his work involves the development of bioactive peptides and new biomaterials with biomedical application.
Significant Awards.
2009 Awarded a D.Sc. by Liverpool University for his work in the field of Biochemistry 
2010 Appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. for services to science and higher education
2012 Conferred the title of Academician by the Academy of Social Sciences in recognition of his work on science and education policy
2013 Awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the University of Bolton (DUniv) for his contribution to higher education, management and scholarship in the North West.
2013 Elected as a non-medic to Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh for achieving considerable distinction in medical research & education
Professional recognition.
He was granted Chartered Chemist status by the Royal Society of Chemistry in the UK and later made a Fellow of the Society (FRSC). In addition he was recognised as a Chartered Biologist and became a Fellow of the Institute of Biology, (FIBiol). He also became recognised as a Chartered Mathematician and later advanced to Fellowship of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. In 2007 he was recognised as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 2008 his work in support of teaching was recognised by the award of a Senior Fellowship by the Higher Education Academy.
Career history.
His PhD work engaged his interest in the role amphipilicity plays in driving the interaction of bioactive molecules with cell membranes. He was awarded a Long Term Fellowship by the European Molecular Biology Organisation which enabled him to investigate the importance of amphiphilicty in protein translocation at Utrecht University Centre for Biomembranes and Lipid Enzymology. He continued to work on amphiphilic helices, being one of the first to help characterise their role as membrane protein anchors. He later expanded this work to investigate the importance of structure-function relationships in the design of antimicrobial peptides and in 2000 was awarded a Chair in Biochemistry at the University of Central Lancashire. From 1996-1999 he was a Visiting Professor in Bioinformatics at Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhI) where he began developing his interest in algorithms for identification of low homology repeat sequences.
In 2000 he launched a new Department of Forensic and Investigative Science at the University of Central Lancashire and in 2002 he became Dean of Science and launched a new School of Pharmacy. At this time he began developing links overseas with the aim of expanding higher education opportunity, especially in India and was invited to become a member of the D Y Patil Academic Council supporting a range of educational institutes. During this time he also remained the UK representative on the European Committee of Biological Associations (ECBA) and for a while was a Commissioner for Biotechnology. He remains an international advisor on higher education and science to the University of Guyana.
In 2008 he became Deputy Vice-Chancellor with responsibility for strategic planning and performance across the University of Central Lancashire group. In 2010 he created UCLan Biomedical Technology Ltd, a research institute based in Shenzhen, China, which focuses on areas of nanoscience and nanoengineering. As the inaugural Chair he oversaw the development of research collaborations with key Chinese universities such as Fudan University and Sichuan University. His work was recognised by the latter via the award of a Professorship. In 2012 he became Chair of UCLan Cyprus Ltd and provided the academic lead on the de novo creation of a private university in Larnaca, obtaining a license to operate from the Ministry of Education with approval to initially run courses in business, languages, law, computing and mathematics.
In 2013 he was selected to replace Martin Earwicker upon his retierment as Vice Chancellor and Chief Executive of London South Bank University.
Public service.
He was appointed to an advisory committee for the appointment of Justice of the Peace by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a service which at the time came under the auspices of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. His work has tended to remain focused around the public understanding of science and education more broadly defined. He was appointed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as a Trustee for the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. He has been a Trustee and Chair of the Education Committee for Darwen Aldridge Community Academy and for a brief time was a Governor at Kirkham Grammar School. In 2009 he was appointed as an Ambassador to the Government Equalities Office to support work focused on increasing diversity in public life.

Songs for Ellen

Songs for Ellen is a 1994 album by American jazz guitarist Joe Pass. It was recorded in 1992 and released posthumously.
History.
All tracks on this album are performed on acoustic guitar, are from the same 1992 session that produced "Unforgettable." Those two recordings were the only Pass records where he played a nylon-string guitar exclusively. "We had talked about an all-acoustic album for years," (producer) Eric Miller explains. "I wanted to do the equivalent of what Norman (Granz) had done with Art Tatum and Joe. We ran tape all of the time, something I had learned to do with him anyway. It was very satisfying."
The title song is a ballad written for his wife.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, music critic Ken Dryden wrote of the album "Most of the works of Joe Pass tended to be improvised blues, so the title track is an exception — a simple yet elegant ballad written for his wife... The good news is that there are several more unreleased sessions by Joe Pass that will follow this superb collection."

2008 Weng'an riot

The 2008 Weng'an riot was a riot on June 28, 2008 involving tens of thousands of residents in Weng'an County, Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, in the Guizhou province of Southwest China. Rioters smashed government buildings and torched several police cars to protest against an alleged police cover-up of a girl's death.
Incident.
Alleged rape and murder.
A 16 year-old local girl by the name of Li Shufen (李树芬, born in July 1991) was found dead in a river. She had been earlier being spotted with two younger men who allegedly had familial ties with the local public security bureau. Li Shufen's family and friends have said that she was raped and murdered by the son of a prominent Weng'an official and another youth and that her corpse was then thrown into the river.
The subsequent media release denied the claims, and states the two young men and one young woman involved are of local farmers' families.
Defending the coffin.
The parents were guarding the girl's coffin day and night in fear the local police might attempt to tamper with the evidence. "We won't accept an evil deal," say parents. The parents reported there have already been two attempts to steal the dead body. An additional 100 local residents have helped them guard the coffin.
Claims.
Police.
The girl's dead body was pulled from the river on June 22, 2008. Initial police report said that the girl was drowned or jumped into the river and committed suicide. A document submitted by the local government stated the girl was unhappy with life because her parents favored her elder brother.
Girl's family and relatives.
Relatives of the girl blamed the local police for shoddy investigation and possible corruption. One of the parents said a police officer threatened them, telling them: “Don't even try to file a lawsuit; there no justice in this world.”
Three murder suspects.
Guizhou's official media published the first interview with three of the girl's friends (the murder suspects) on July 4, 2008. They were the last people to see the girl alive.
Protests.
About 500 middle school students had gone to protest at the public security bureau, but they were turned away and beaten. Rumors have been circulating that the girl's uncle, a local teacher, was beaten when he questioned the police and the uncle died from his injuries at the local hospital but this was not confirmed. This roused an angry mob of thousands of people, who began overturning cars and setting fire to government buildings, including the local Communist party headquarters. The Associated Press reported "30,000 angry citizens swarmed the streets". The riot lasted 7 hours with 150 people injured. About 160 office buildings and 40 cars were torched.
Role of Chinese bloggers.
Zhou, as well as many other like-minded Chinese netizens, provide on-the-scene information on events like this, is a means to give voice to ordinary Chinese whose stories get overlooked in a country where all the media is under the control of China's Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
Roland Soong of East South West North, a well known website that does Chinese-to-English translations, wrote:
Arrests.
Authorities have rounded up 300 people accused of taking part in the riot. Other sources have said 200 rioters were arrested. Over 1,500 paramilitary and riot police were dispatched to the county. Police detained 59 people for their alleged roles.
Government response.
Photographs as well as comments on the Guizhou protest in chatrooms and forums were quickly deleted by the mainland Internet censors. The government launched a campaign to defuse protest ahead of the Beijing Olympics to continue carrying out social harmony and stability. An "Olympics Stability Drive" was announced after the incident. Public security officials in Guizhou offered a total of 9,000 yuan (about $1,300 or £700 or €800) to the parents of the teenage girl, with 3,000 paid by each suspect. The father said “We will never accept an evil deal like this, we need to seek justice for our daughter.”
Guizhou's Communist Party chief, Shi Zongyuan (石宗源), estimated that prior use of force by local officials have contributed to the widespread discontentment. He further said the deep rooted reasons behind the protest were "rude and roughhand solutions" by local authorities to solve disputes over mines, demolition of homes for public projects, relocation of residents for reservoir construction, and many other issues. Several local officials, including Weng'an's Party chief, have been dismissed for breach of duty on July 3 and 4, 2008.
Investigation.
The government "Guizhou Daily" newspaper claimed the family was too emotionally unstable to accept the findings. The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said three men were questioned, but were let go. Xinhua News Agency reported on July 1, 2008 that the investigation would be reopened. The provincial government sent 10 criminal investigators and forensic experts to re-investigate the death. The autopsy was carried out by five experts from the Guizhou public security department and the Higher People's Court. After three autopsies, there were no signs of any sexual attack according to state officials. The girl's father, Li Xiuzhong, did not accept the autopsy findings. He said "There is nothing I can do, they have sent 10 officials to my home, watching me day and night. They told me what to say when the reporters interviewed me. They threatened me that I said anything wrong, then another riot can happen and I must bear in mind that national security is at stake. Li Shufen was buried in her hometown about 20 km from Weng'an. Provincial authority said that every year, about 600 to 800 criminal cases take place in the county, but half of them are not solved.

20 cm leichter Ladungswerfer

The 20 cm leichter Ladungswerfer (20 cm leLdgW) was a spigot mortar used by Germany during World War II. It was used by engineers to demolish obstacles and strongpoints. It was gradually withdrawn from front-line service from 1942.
Propellant was placed at the top of the spigot and ignited when the projectile slid far enough down the spigot to complete the circuit. It fired HE (high explosive) and smoke rounds in addition to a special "Harpunengeschosse" (harpoon bomb) that carried a rope with hooks to clear mines or wire obstacles.

Greg &amp; Steve

Greg & Steve are a musical group based in Los Angeles, California. The duo, composed of Greg Scelsa and Steve Millang, has been performing and recording children's music since the 1970s. Scelsa and Millang both perform as vocalists and guitarists. They have recorded 18 albums, one music video compilation, and one live concert DVD. Greg & Steve are marketed toward children from preschool age through primary school and have sold more than 4 million albums, making them the best selling children's music duo in the United States. They also have a rigorous concert schedule, playing an average of 100 shows per year including venues such as Carnegie Hall.
Scelsa and Millang, who have known each other since high school, moved from their hometown of Newport Beach, California to Los Angeles to "be closer to the music business" in 1968. They took jobs as special education assistants, and soon started performing music for the children, many of whom had emotional or behavioral problems. They found that their music had a positive effect on children with disorders such as autism. For the next several years, they performed their music program for different schools. In 1975, they decided to form a record company, Youngheart Records, and presented a recording of their music to National Association for the Education of Young Children convention attendees. After receiving a positive reaction at the conference, Scelsa and Millang formed "Greg & Steve" and began selling their recordings in the educational market.
In 1991, Scelsa and Millang sold the majority interest of Youngheart Records to Creative Teaching Press and have expanded into internet and retail sales. The expansion allowed them to begin selling their music in larger markets such as retailers Barnes & Noble, and allowed them to focus on their music rather than on business tasks. As of 2002, Greg & Steve have received nine Parents' Choice Awards. In 2010, their album "Jumpin' and Jammin" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children.

Tenix Defence

Tenix Defence was Australia's largest defence contractor with core capabilities in Aerospace, Land, Marine and Electronic Systems applications. BAE Systems announced its intention to acquire the company from Tenix in January 2008 and the acquisition was completed in June 2008 for A$775 million (£373 million). BAE Systems Australia thus became Australia's largest defence contractor.
The company was formed in 1997 after it was split from parent company Transfield Services. It was part of Tenix until the defence contracting arm became known as Tenix Defence. It had two divisions: Tenix Marine and Tenix Aerospace and Defence (comprising the former Land, Aerospace and Electronic Systems divisions).
Land.
Tenix Defence provided design, manufacture, modification and repairs to all major in-service military vehicles in Australia. It had over 300 employees in Wingfield, South Australia and Bandiana, Victoria. Wingfield is Australia's largest privately operated military vehicle facility, offering engineering, integrated logistic support, through-life support, configuration management, prototyping, warehousing, production and paint shop facilities.
At Bandiana, the Land Division provided logistic and garrison support services to Joint Logistics Command. This included warehousing and heavy grade maintenance of artillery, guided weapons, armoured and non-armoured vehicles and other Army weapon systems. Major projects undertaken by the Land Division included LAND 106 M113 Upgrade Project
and 10 Armoured Limousines (based upon the Holden Caprice) for the Australian Attorney-General’s Department.
Marine.
Tenix Defence Marine Division was a major ship designer and builder in the Asia Pacific region focusing on the delivery of solutions to defence and commercial opportunities for both new build and support activities.
New construction, repairs and maintenance were undertaken at Australian shipyards in Williamstown, Victoria and Henderson, Western Australia. Both facilities also performed in-service support. The Whangarei site in New Zealand fabricated ANZAC superstructure and hull modules. Other facilities were located in Darwin, Cairns, Brisbane and Sydney. The division had experience in designing, building and delivering more than 200 naval, paramilitary and specialist vessels.
Ships built by Tenix Defence include 10 "Anzac" class frigates and HMNZS "Otago". In June 2007, the Australian Minister for Defence announced that Tenix Defence was the preferred tenderer for the construction of the two Canberra class large amphibious ships at a cost of $3 billion. The ships are due to enter service from 2013. Tenix had proposed to build the Navantia design in partnership with the Spanish company.
Aerospace.
Through its heritage, Tenix Defence had an unbroken chain of experience in the Australian aviation industry spanning six decades. The Aerospace Division was established in 1998 specifically to provide a support capability for Australian Defence Force (ADF) aircraft programs.
It gained Authorised Engineering Organisation Certification to conduct design on a number of defence aircraft. The Division also holds Australian Department of Defence certification for Earned Value Management. It was managed from Melbourne, and had its own hangar at Melbourne Airport. The division also worked on projects with the ADF on-site at HMAS Albatross at Nowra, RAAF Williamtown and RAAF Edinburgh.
Electronic Systems.
Electronic Systems Division (ESD) was the technology and electronic systems hub of Tenix Defence and maintained close ties with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. It was a provider of integrated solutions for Network Enabled Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare and Network Centric Warfare (NCW).
Major projects undertaken by the Electronic Systems Division included Advanced Air Defence Simulator (AADS) to train Australian Army operators in the SAAB Bofors Dynamics RBS-70 Ground Based Air Defence weapon, LAND 53, Phase 1E Ninox Ground Surveillance Radar, Phase 1F Ninox Thermal Surveillance System and Phase 2B Ninox Unattended Ground Sensors.

Evergreen, Baltimore

Evergreen is a neighborhood in the North District of Baltimore, Maryland. Evergreen's buildings date from the late 19th to early 20th century. It is known as one of the first early non-rowhouse styled suburban communities in Baltimore.
Boundaries.
Zip code–21210
History.
The Evergreen neighborhood is located in North Baltimore and was one of the first residential developments in its area, coming even before Roland Park. The land subdivided to become Evergreen was inherited by an heir of the Cockey family in 1813 and was originally called “Ridgely’s Whim.” In 1873, two men named Brooks and Barton purchased the land and began to create a neighborhood called Evergreen for middle-class workers and their families. 
The Evergreen is a rare example of an early non-rowhouse suburban-style community. The neighborhood was easily accessible, despite being several miles from the heart of Baltimore. There were two railroad stops on opposite corners of the neighborhood; one was at Cold Spring Lane and one at Oakdale. This connection to the city allowed the neighborhood to grow and thrive. However, neither of these railroad stations exists today. 
The neighborhood was overwhelmingly composed of hard-working citizens. Many of its residents were builders and tradesmen who worked in Roland Park during its major period of construction from 1895 to 1910. Most of Roland Park's firemen (who were mostly volunteers) ironically lived in the Evergreen neighborhood. 
Demographics.
According to the 2000 census, the Evergreen neighborhood is made up of 405 residents. It is a predominantly white neighborhood, with 97.5 percent of the people being white. The majority of the residents do not have children under 18 years old living in their households (though there is a considerable upward trend of young children since the census), and the median age is 35 years. About half of the residents are married. The median family income is about $65,000 per year. 43 percent of the residents are single with an average salary of $46,000 per year. Forty of the individuals are below the poverty level, and there are 34 individuals who have not completed high school. However, 195 of the residents have completed college, with 115 stopping at a bachelor's degree and 80 holding a graduate or professional degree. The most common occupations among residents are considered management and professional roles. 
Architecture and Design.
The 205 houses that make up Evergreen, come in many different architectural styles. Schenley Road, Keswick Road, Wilmslow Road and Evergreen's other smaller streets feature Victorian houses as well as two-story shingle-style houses, -story Queen Anne–style houses and contemporaries.
While Evergreen is mostly composed of residential houses, it also features a neighborhood commercial area on the south boundary at Cold Spring Lane. The neighborhood streets are set up in a grid pattern with alleys. The driveways to the houses—that is, those few that have driveways—are accessible by the alleys. This allows the sidewalks to be unbroken by curb cuts. The houses, which face the street, are surrounded by luscious greenery. Most houses have good-sized yards, well-tended gardens and a variety of trees, shrubs, and bushes. The sidewalks in front of the houses promote communication between residents and allow for a close-knit community.

Winnipesaukee Playhouse

The Winnipesaukee Playhouse is a 200+ seat courtyard style theater located in Meredith, New Hampshire, United States, in the heart of New Hampshire's Lakes Region. The Playhouse produces both a professional summer stock season as well as a community theater season, and is arguably the only theater in the United States to do so. The Winnipesaukee Playhouse is the recipient of 46 New Hampshire Theater Awards over the past eight years, more than any other theater in the state during this time period, and in 2009 it was selected by "New Hampshire Magazine" as the best professional theater in New Hampshire. In 2013 the Winni Playhouse moved from Weirs Beach in Laconia to the former Annalee Dolls campus in Meredith. The new theater has 200 seats as well as support spaces such as offices, dressing rooms, and a lobby, which the previous theater did not have.
History.
The Winnipesaukee Playhouse was founded in 2004 by brother and sister Bryan Halperin and Lesley Pankhurst, as well as their spouses, Johanna and Neil. They opened the Playhouse in the Alpenrose Plaza (the former Dexter Shoes outlet plaza) in the village of Weirs Beach in the city of Laconia, New Hampshire. The theater started with a professional summer stock season, and then continued with community theater and children's theater during the rest of the year. In 2006 it became a non-profit organization.
In 2008, Hidden Green LLC, investors in the Winnipesaukee Playhouse, purchased the Annalee Dolls factory site for 1.05 million dollars. The Playhouse renovated this property to create a "Tanglewood type of setting" to perform theater and other endeavors in. The theater moved from its previous site in Weirs Beach to the site of Annalee's former gift shop in 2013. 
As of 2012, the Winnipesaukee Playhouse has performed 91 plays, 45 of which were professional summer stock, with the rest being community theater or children's theater.
New theater.
The access to the Annalee Dolls campus allowed the Winnipesaukee Playhouse to greatly expand and create the first performing arts complex in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire. The campus contains over of land dotted with seven buildings containing of space. The new campus offers a state-of-the-art theatre that can seat about 200 patrons, a summer theatre camp for students entering grades K-8, an outdoor amphitheater with performances available before select shows, and a brand-new menu. The entire project to create a performing arts campus cost roughly four million dollars. The new theater, with almost 200 seats, more than doubles the audience space that the previous theatre held (84 seats).

Alcántara Bridge

The Alcántara Bridge (also known as Puente Trajan at Alcantara) is a Roman stone arch bridge built over the Tagus River at Alcántara, Spain between 104 and 106 AD by an order of the Roman Emperor Trajan in 98. It bears the inscription "Pontem perpetui mansurum in saecula" (I have built a bridge which will last forever) on the archway over the central pier.
__NOTOC__
History.
The Alcántara Bridge has taken more damage from war than from the elements. The Moors destroyed the smallest arch on the left side in 1214. This was rebuilt centuries later in 1543 with stone from the original quarries. The second arch on the right side was destroyed by the Spanish to stop the Portuguese and was repaired in 1762 by Charles III, only to be blown up again in 1809 to stop the French. Temporary repairs were made in 1819 and were replaced in 1860 with mortared masonry.
Dimensions.
The bridge originally measured 190 m in length, which is today reduced to 181.7 m. The clear spans of the six arches from the right to the left riverside are 13.6, 23.4, 28.8, 27.4, 21.9 and 13.8 m.

Plot.
"Wide Awake".
The novel opens with the revelation that the United States has just elected into power Abe Stein, its first openly gay (and Jewish) president. Alongside running mate Alice Martinez, Stein won a tight race by the mere margin of 1,000 Kansas votes, signalling a watershed for progressive politics, which take the limelight for the first time in decades.
Although the lives of American homosexuals are drastically improved even before Stein's election, and the country is in the main far more liberal, it remains divided along acute political lines: as Hoffman notes, "the pendulum has merely swung slightly to the left, thanks to voters fed up with economic inequality, ongoing health crises and a politically motivated 'War to End All Wars' against 'extremists everywhere.'"
The novel's focus, however, is on the personal impact of the election on a teenager named Duncan, who is also Jewish and openly gay. Although too young to vote, he is a strong supporter of Stein; thus, when the conservative governor demands a recount, and Stein's followers are prevailed upon to gather in support, he finds himself in a dilemma between his parents, who want him to stay home, and his politically passionate boyfriend, who demands that he stand up for what he believes in.
Reception.
"Wide Awake" was generally well received. Hoffman praised in particular its skilful mingling of the political with the personal, going so far as to draw comparisons with John Fox's "The Boys on the Rock", although he noted dissimilarities that were far more conspicuous: "Just 22 years separate these books, but the worlds they inhabit seem impossibly distant." For one thing, whereas "The Boys on the Rock" is set in the past, "Wide Awake" looks to the near future, "likely a couple of decades from now."
Hoffman was not entirely impressed, though:
Predicting trends — particularly regarding teenagers' fashions and slang — is difficult, and Levithan sometimes stumbles. It's hard to imagine even politically aware teens flocking to a "non-mall," where anti-consumers shop for items they'd like to buy, only to forgo those purchases and donate to charity the cash they could have spent on themselves. And it's hard to imagine anyone actually saying, "There's nothing like a little non-shopping to get your mind back to happyzoom."
"But," he noted, "if minor details ring false, the major elements of "Wide Awake" seem essentially plausible. Levithan outlines a world of new possibilities for gay Americans, without positing a utopia where homophobia has vanished and the entire country has changed political orientation."
Interpretation.
"Progressive activists have long asserted that the personal is political," wrote Hoffman in his review for "The Washington Post". "In David Levithan's young-adult novel "Wide Awake", that old slogan gains new life. And the reverse is also true: In "Wide Awake", the political is personal in unprecedented ways."
He went on to observe that, whereas in Fox's "The Boys on the Rock", the main political character was in the eyes of the protagonist only a politician, "Duncan sees in Stein a reflection of himself. If Stein wins, Duncan shares the victory as a gay Jew who can, at last, truly imagine becoming president one day."

Gikondo Prison

Gikondo Prison or Kigali City Prison is a prison in Kigali, Rwanda.
It was built in the 1930s, was only intended originally to house a few thousand inmates. Following the Rwandan genocide, the numbers increased to above 50,000 as a large proportion of the inmates were genocidaires. Those who were brought to the Gacaca courts to undergo trial for war crimes stayed at the prison.
The International Committee of the Red Cross played an important role in reviewing the places of detention and to visit detainees accused of participating in the genocide. Overcrowding was still a major problem in 1997, and the prison infrastructure inappropriate for the number of new prisoners. Lack of food and medical care and poor hygiene conditions continuing to undermine health in the prison. Conditions in the prison as with others in Rwanda, deteriorated again despite showing improvements before the war.
In October 1999, the ICRC submitted a confidential report to the highest authorities in Rwanda. Following negotiations, the ICRC then improved the supply of delivery of food, resources and medicines to civilian prisoners, undertook repairs and renovation and provided essential supplies for the prison.

About Ain Baal.
Ain Baal borders Tyre, Batolay, Bazooreye and Hanaway. Ain Baal is famous for the Sarcophagus of King Hiram I, King of Tyre, which is located on the borders with Hanaway. The influence of the sarcophagus King Hiram I on this village is very obvious, where you can find schools, convenience stores, barbershops and restaurants named after the king such as the Hiram Elementary School of Ain Baal. Ain Baal is also the home village of the famous Lebanese football midfielder Roda Antar. Ain Baal plays a strategic role for the southern Lebanese residents, where they can live in the village and enjoy a calm atmosphere away from Tyre traffic and at the same time they can visit Tyre in a short period of time to get their needs. Ain baal contains one of the most prestigious places in Lebanon called "Housh Basma" where most of the buildings are villas and occupied by Basma residents.

Skiing in Lebanon

Skiing in Lebanon has been a popular sport since an engineering student returning from studying in Switzerland brought back with him the sport of skiing to Lebanon in the early twentieth century.
Overview.
Lebanon, a mountainous country with summits reaching heights of over 10,000 feet, is often referred to as the "Switzerland of the East". Lebanon is home to six well-equipped, well-maintained ski resorts, located on the Mount Lebanon range that faces the Mediterranean and offers terrific downhill ski slopes. The six resorts have a combined 49 ski lifts with pistes totaling 300 km in length. Lebanon's ski resorts are accessible on a day trip with the nearest ski resorts less than an hour's drive from the capital, Beirut. The sociable Lebanese ensure that the après-ski scene is as memorable as the skiing. A seventh ski field, a steep and rugged one that is suitable for the most intrepid skiers only, is at Mount Hermon, but due to the political situation with Israel and Syria, the field has never been developed into a resort. In 2005, plans for a US$1 billion skiing resort, Sannine Zenith, were revealed.
History.
Skiing was introduced to Lebanon in 1913 when Ramez Ghazzoui, a Lebanese engineer, returned from his studies in Switzerland and introduced his friends to the sport in the mountains near Aley in Mount Lebanon. In 1934, "Le Club Libanais", the first ski club in Lebanon, was founded by Mauritius Tabet, Mounir Itani, and sisters Andrée Khasho and Aimée Kettaneh. The following year, the French Army established the first ski school at "Le Grand Cèdre" hotel at the Cedars of God in northern Lebanon. In 1937, the school moved to a high mountain barracks, and would later become known as the Military Ski School.
By the 1940s, Lebanon had established competitions, clubs, and ski schools throughout the country, and began competing at an international level. James Riddell, the British champion skier who was often called the Father of Modern Ski Journalism, administered in 1942 a ski and mountaineering school for the Australian 9th Army at the Cedars of God. In 1947, Lebanon competed for the first time at the international championship in Chamonix, France, with Michel Samen carrying the Lebanese flag. One year later, Lebanon competed in the Winter Olympic Games for the first time at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Four athletes competed – Mounir Itani, Jean Samen, Abdelwahab El Rifai and Ibrahim Geagea.
In 1959, the resort of Oyoune el Simane known today as Mzaar Kfardebian was started 
1961 saw the official establishment of the Lebanese Ski Federation under President Dr. Emile Riachi.
In 1967 and 1972 the federation cooperated with the Lebanese Army to host the World Championship of Military Ski.
From 1962 until the eruption of the civil war in 1975, a World Cup Competition named “Semaine Internationale du Ski aux Cedres” took place yearly in The Cedars and attracted the world’s most prestigious champions
Lebanese skiing history was at its peak in 1967 when the 26th annual International Ski Federation (ISF) conference was held in Beirut.
At the time of its construction in 1974, Faqra Club, which was built at the foot of Mount Sannine with the help of Swiss architects, was one of the premier private skiing resorts in the world. With altitudes ranging between 1700 and 2000 meters, the resort offered a dozen pistes of varying levels that permitted skiers to enjoy the sport day and night. On clear days, one could see the Mediterranean and the capital, Beirut, from the summits.
In 1993, the Lebanese-American, Richard Elias initiated the International Peace Ski, in which he led a group of thirteen professional skiers from ten different countries to ski in Lebanon.
Lebanese skiers have participated in the Winter Olympic Games since 1948 and in World Championships: Innsbruck (1964), Greece (1967), Sapporo (1972), Innsbruck (1976), Grenoble (1969), Lake Placid (1980), Calgary (1988) and Albertville (1992).
Season.
The ski season, which is similar to the Alps, typically runs from mid-December to April, depending on the length and depth of snowfall. In spring, it is sometimes possible to snow ski in the morning and drive to the coast in the afternoon to water ski.

Riverside, Atlanta

Riverside is an intown neighborhood located in northwest Atlanta, Georgia. It is so named because it is situated along the Chattahoochee River.
Geography.
Riverside is bordered by the Chattahoochee River to the north, Jackson Parkway to the west, Southern Railway train tracks to the south and Paul Avenue to the east. Bolton Road is the main arterial street that runs through the neighborhood and at the intersection with Main Street is a small village center with a restaurant, car wash, and thrift shop. The neighborhood is encompassed in the 30318 ZIP code.
History.
The area that is now known as Riverside started as a working plantation, known as the Spink Estate after its owner, James W. Spink. Spink sold the first lots, which are now occupied by the residence and carriage house at the intersection of Spink Street and Hollywood Road, for the start of this new community in 1892. An article in the "Atlanta Constitution" dated June 9, 1892 was titled “Atlanta on the Chattahoochee – The City Has Gone Clear To the River – The Sale at Riverside.” One of the main streets of the neighborhood is called Spink Street. Spink died suddenly in 1906 and Spink’s widow, Elizabeth, continued to live in Riverside until her death in 1910. In 1914, the remainder of the Spink Estate was sold as 300 lots and 20 small farms. In time, the farms gave way to more houses. Riverside was annexed into the city of Atlanta in 1952. Today, Riverside is a prosperous community in which older houses are being renovated or torn down to make way for new larger homes.
Education.
Riverside, like all areas of the City of Atlanta, is part of the Atlanta Public Schools district. It is served by Bolton Academy (Elementary), Sutton Middle School, and North Atlanta High School.

Alison Tyler

Alison Tyler (born 1972) is an American author, editor and publisher of erotica, living in Northern California. She has authored over 20 explicit novels, hundreds of short stories and has edited more than 60 erotic anthologies.
Career.
Tyler began writing professionally in the early 1990s selling stories to Penthouse Variations and Playgirl. Her first novel was published by Blue Moon when she was 23. Tyler went on to write twelve novels for Masquerade Books before moving to Virgin Books' Black Lace and Cheek imprints in 1999.
Her short story fiction appears in a range of anthologies, including titles edited by Violet Blue, Stephen Elliott, Maxim Jakubowski, Rachel Kramer Bussel, Tristan Taormino, Zane and Tyler herself. She has edited numerous erotic anthologies for Cleis Press and Pretty Things Press, the small publishing company Tyler runs.
Tyler writes in an intimate, semi-autobiographical style, focussing on themes of female submission, spanking, bondage, bi-sexuality and group sex. In August 2006, Tyler began blogging intensely about a former BDSM relationship, described by The Guardian as "a sulphurous personal memoir of past sexual activities which put Belle de Jour's timid exploits in the shade." Initially intending to write confessionally each day for a month, Tyler continued with her story for 16 months, gaining a broad and loyal daily readership.
Described as a "trollop with a laptop" by East Bay Express, Tyler continues to blog regularly, using the platform to engage with readers, and to promote emerging writers by showcasing their work in competitive "Smut Marathons". In 2013, the first in a trilogy of novels based on Tyler's diaries and personal blog entries is published. Billed by the publisher, Cleis Press as a "work of autobiographical fiction, a meta-novel with reality at the core", "Dark Secret Love: A Story of Submission" takes its title from the William Blake poem, The Sick Rose.
Tyler's work has been translated into several languages and her short story fiction appears in her collections "Blue Sky Sideways", "Bad Girl" and "Exposed". Her non-fiction includes "Never Have the Same Sex Twice: a Guide for Couples" and "Never Say Never "(forthcoming). 
Tyler is an upbeat supporter of non-mainstream sexualities, erotic fiction and pornography, asserting, "People try to make you feel bad by saying, 'You write porn.' But I won't feel bad for it."

"May death come to you on swift wings, may your spoils turn into serpents and coil around your necks, may the rest of your days be stricken with unending sickness, may your children's bodies belong to the fire, may every last one of you anguish in eternal pain, crying aloud for mercy, while we turn our heads away with a smile and a deaf ear."
"In payment for your treachery, we will accept your thieving hands on our finest plates, your sullen heads on our tallest flag poles, and your worthless souls in our enveloping clutches. All the while we will watch your graveless corpses writhe with worms and turn into an eternal, restless dust."

Raymond Alvah Hanson

Raymond Alvah Hanson (December 10, 1923 – February 18, 2009), was an entrepreneur, inventor and engineer who lived in Spokane, Washington. Hanson held over 100 patents. He created and produced equipment that was used on the Trans-Alaskan pipeline, on canals in over 50 countries (including the California Aqueduct System) and the self-leveling control for hillside Combine Harvesters.
Background.
Hanson was born in Potlatch, Idaho in 1923, the son of Ray & Orda (Hensley) Hanson. The family later moved to Palouse, Washington. Hanson grew up around the iconic rolling hills of the Palouse region, which would play into his first invention,the self leveling control for Combine Harvesters. Hanson attended the University of Idaho, majoring in electrical engineering. At the age of 19 while farming in Palouse, Washington he applied his engineering and farming knowledge to finding a better way to harvest the fertile but often steep slopes found in that area.
In 1941 Hanson conceived of the self-leveling control for hillside combines, and by 1945 the first self leveling mechanisms were built.
Hanson founded the RAHCO Company to build self-leveling mechanisms and since then, RAHCO of Spokane, Washington has grown into a world leader in the design and production of custom commercial machinery systems. RAHCO estimates that automatic leveling has saved at least three percent of grain harvested on lands where combine leveling is needed, which is worth millions of dollars each year. 
After the self-leveling control for hillside combines, Hanson began adapting the ideas and principles he had developed into a wide variety of construction machines used for canal, highway, dam, and airport construction. He went on to found a company that became a world leader in the design and production of custom commercial machinery, including the largest canal finishing machinery in the world for the California aqueduct, the world's largest 2,000 ton gantry crane used in the Grand Coulee Dam power plant project, and creating equipment that has been used on the Alaska pipeline project.
To date, Hanson has designed and marketed major construction machinery in more than 50 countries and has brought more than $150,000,000 worth of business back to the northwest and the Inland Empire. 
Hanson died on February 18, 2009 and is survived by his wife Lois and six children, 20 grandchildren and 24 great grandchildren.

Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge

The Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge is a national wildlife refuge located on the northern border of the U.S. state of Nevada. A very small part extends northward into Oregon. It is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as the Nevada component of the Sheldon-Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which is headquartered in Lakeview, Oregon. The Sheldon Refuge is noted for its population of wild horses.
In 1931, the refuge was established under executive order to carry out three central goals: First, the refuge was to provide a habitat for the "antelope" (more properly called the pronghorn), an animal whose population was in decline during the early 1900s. Second, conservation efforts were put forth to protect native fish, wildlife and plants. Finally, the refuge was to serve as an inviolate migratory bird sanctuary. 
Advocates characterize Sheldon as one of the few intact sagebrush steppe ecosystems in the Great Basin, one that hosts a variety of wildlife endemic to the unique environment. Desert fishes, greater sage-grouse, migratory birds, mule deer and the pygmy rabbit are all residents of the refuge.
Description.
The Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge occupies an arid zone of volcanic terrain. Rockhounds search for semiprecious stones such as fire opals. Geothermal hot springs provide some water. The dominant ecosystem plant life consists of drought-tolerant species such as sagebrush, juniper, mountain mahogany, bitterbrush, and aspen. The elevation ranges from to above sea level. 
In this forbidding landscape lives a large population of free-range fauna, with the American mustang, the so-called "wild horse" of the American West, being the best known. There are also large herds of mule deer, an estimated 3,500 pronghorn, and a small but self-sustaining population of bighorn sheep. 
The bighorn are not strictly native to the Sheldon Refuge, having been extirpated there during the frontier era and successfully reintroduced about 1930. The pronghorn "antelope" played a key role in the history of the Refuge, as approximately 94 percent of the current protected land area was originally set aside as the "Charles Sheldon Antelope Range" in 1936. 
The Refuge is the home of an endemic fish species of limited geographic distribution, the Alvord chub.
The nearest community of any size is Denio, Nevada, 14 miles from the Refuge's eastern boundary. The nearest divided highway is Interstate 80 in Winnemucca, Nevada, approximately 100 miles to the south.
Controversy.
Proposals to cull some of the alleged excess population of mustang in the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge were drawing public concern . The official Fish and Wildlife (USFWS) position, as stated on their Refuge website, was that "horses and burros are not native to Sheldon Refuge. They are descended from domestic stock turned loose around the turn of the twentieth century. They are primarily grass eaters, and their grazing can devastate native vegetation and cause severe damage to riparian habitat." Some private-sector advocates, such as the Sierra Club, agree with the USFWS position. 
In response, the "American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign" has accused the USFWS of conducting "helicopter round-ups during foaling season" in the Sheldon Refuge. The recent history of roundups at the refuge are controversial with indications that many ended up at slaughterhouses. 
The population of Sheldon horses are the descendants of horses used by the US Army. Harry Wilson was one of the ranchers that sold horses to the US Cavalry. When the Wilsons owned the Virgin Valley Ranch, they worked with the Army, which provided thoroughbred stallions that were bred with the Wilsons' standardbreds. 
Sheldon officials have decided to remove all horses from the Refuge by 2014.

In April 2007, while President Bagapsh was in Moscow for medical treatment, the results of an investigation into corruption within the Sukhumi city administration were made public. The investigation found that large sums had been embezzled and upon his return, on 2 May, Bagapsh fired Adleiba along with his deputy Boris Achba, the head of the Sukhumi's finance department Konstantin Tuzhba and the head of the housing department David Jinjolia.
On 4 June Adleiba paid back to the municipal budget 200,000 rubels. On 23 July, Adleiba resigned from the Sukhumi city council, citing health reasons and the need to travel abroad for medical treatment.

Latter Day Saint polygamy in the late-19th century

Possibly as early as the 1830s, followers of the Latter Day Saint movement (also known as Mormonism), were practicing the doctrine of polygamy or "plural marriage". After the death of church founder Joseph Smith, Jr., the doctrine was officially announced in Utah by Mormon leader Brigham Young in 1852, attributed posthumously to Smith, and the practice of polygamy began among Mormons at large, principally in Utah where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) had relocated after the Illinois Mormon War.
In the years after the church began practicing polygamy, it drew intense scrutiny and criticism from the United States government. This criticism led to the Mormon War, and eventually the abandonment of the practice under the leadership of Wilford Woodruff who issued the 1890 Manifesto.
Official Sanction by the LDS Church.
The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the Twelve Apostles Orson Pratt and LDS President Brigham Young in a special conference of the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assembled in the Mormon Tabernacle on 28 August 1852, and reprinted in the "Deseret News Extra" the following day. The announcement came nine years after the purported original revelation by Joseph Smith, and five years after the Mormon Exodus to Utah following Smith's death in Illinois. Young was unable to produce the original document and declared that Smith's widow Emma Smith had burned it. To this Emma Smith replied that she had never seen such a document, and added concerning the story that she had destroyed the original: "It is false in all its parts, made out of whole cloth, without any foundation in truth."
Controversy and opposition by the United States government.
Early tension and the Utah War (1852-1858).
Polygamy was roundly condemned by virtually all sections of the American public. During the Presidential Election of 1856 a key plank of the newly formed Republican Party's platform was a pledge "to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery".
Further tension grew due to the relationship between "Gentile" federal appointees and the Utah territorial leadership. The territory's Organic Act held that the governor, federal judges, and other important territorial positions were to be filled by appointees chosen by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but without any reference to the will of Utah's population. Many of these federally appointed officers were appalled by the practice of polygamy and the Mormon belief system in general, and would harangue the Mormons for their "lack of morality" in public addresses. This already tense situation was further exacerbated by a period of intense religious revival starting in late 1856 dubbed the "Mormon Reformation."
The issue of polygamy among the Latter Day Saints in Utah was one of the contributing factors that lead to the Utah War, in which the President of the United States dispatched an army to Utah to quell a perceived rebellion. In the midst of the American Civil War, Republican majorities in congress were able to pass legislation meant to curb the Mormon practice of polygamy. One such act was the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act which was signed into law on July 8, 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln. The act banned plural marriage and limited church and non-profit ownership in any territory of the United States to $50,000. The act targeted the LDS Church ownership in the Utah Territory. The measure had no funds allocated for enforcement, and thus it was not rigorously enforced against Mormons in Utah Territory. The Mormons, believing that the law unconstitutionally deprived them of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion, chose to ignore this law at this time.
Aftermath and further legislation (1858-1890).
In the following years, several bills aimed at strengthening the anti-bigamy laws failed to pass the United States Congress. These included the Wade, Cragin, and Cullom bills which had their origin in the territory of Utah and were initiated by men who were bitterly opposed to the Mormon establishment. The Wade Bill initiated in 1866 would have destroyed local government if it had passed. Three years later the Cragin Bill was proposed, but within a few days it was substituted by the Cullom Bill, which was more radical than the Wade or Cragin bills. Members of the church worked for the defeat of the bill, including women of the church who held mass meetings throughout the territory in January 1870 in opposition to the bill.
Finally, the Poland Act (18 Stat. 253) of 1874 was passed which sought to facilitate prosecutions under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act by eliminating the control members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) exerted over the justice system of Utah Territory. Sponsored by Senator Luke P. Poland of Vermont, the Act redefined the jurisdiction of Utah courts by giving the United States district courts exclusive jurisdiction in Utah Territory over all civil and criminal cases. The Act also eliminated the territorial marshal and attorney, giving their duties to a U.S. Marshal and a U.S. Attorney. The Act also altered petit and grand jury empaneling rules to keep polygamists off juries. By removing Latter-day Saints from positions of authority in the Utah justice system, the Act was intended to allow for successful prosecutions of Mormon polygamists.
Immediately, under the act, the United States Attorney tried to bring leading church officials to trial. These efforts culminated in the sentencing of George Reynolds to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of five hundred dollars for his practice of polygamy. In 1876 the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence. His 1878 "Reynolds v. United States" appeal reached the United States Supreme Court, and in January 1879 that body ruled the anti-polygamy legislation constitutional and upheld Reynold’s prison sentence (it struck down the fine and hard labor portions). Reynolds was released from prison in January 1881, having served eighteen months of his original sentence.
In February 1882, George Q. Cannon, a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue in national politics. One month later, the Edmunds Act was passed, amending the Morrill Act by declaring polygamy a felony, revoking the polygamists right to vote, making them ineligible for jury service, and prohibiting them from holding political office. These restrictions were enforced regardless of whether an individual was actually practicing polygamy, or merely believed in the Mormon doctrine of plural marriage without actually participating in it. All elected offices in the Utah Territory were vacated, an election board was formed to issue certificates to those who both denied polygamy and did not practice it, and new elections were held territory-wide.
Electoral obstacles to prosecution were now removed, and the new territorial officials began criminal prosecutions in ernest. Judge Charles S. Zane, the Republican appointee of Chester A. Arthur, handed down harsh sentences to church leaders, beginning with Rudger Clawson.
Finally, the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887 touched all the issues at dispute between the United States Congress and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The act disincorporated both the Church and the Perpetual Emigration Fund on the grounds that they fostered polygamy. The act prohibited the practice of polygamy and punished it with a fine of from $500 to $800 and imprisonment of up to five years. It dissolved the corporation of the church and directed the confiscation by the federal government of all church properties valued over a limit of $50,000.
In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize the church and all of its assets. The act was enforced by the U.S. marshal and a host of deputies. The act:
In 1890 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the seizure of Church property under the Edmunds-Tucker Act in "The Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. United States".
The church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate underground. Teaching new marriage and family arrangements where the principles that could not be openly discussed, compounded the problems. Those authorized to teach the doctrine had always stressed the strict covenants, obligations and responsibilities associated with it.
Following the aforementioned passage of the Edmunds-Tucker Act in 1887, the Church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. Among other things, this legislation disincorporated the Church, confiscated its properties, and even threatened seizure of its temples.
Life under polygamy.
Unhappiness associated with plural marriages.
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS church claim that plural marriages often produced extreme unhappiness in some wives. LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book "In Sacred Loneliness", described many instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.
Mormon apologists claim that many women were very satisfied with polygamous marriages, and note that individuals such as Zina Huntington—a polygamous wife of Brigham Young—went on speaking tours as part of the suffrage movement touting the joys and benefits of plural marriage.
Philip Stewart Robinson was a traveling journalist for the Telegraph of London. In his "Sinners and Saints" he notes "I had expected to see men with long whips, sitting on fences, swearing at their gangs of wives at work in the fields. I expected every now and then to hear of druniken saints beating seven or eight wives all at once," but found no such thing. While continuing to disagree with the practice of polygamy, he found that Utah-born girls, the offspring of plural wives, have
figures that would make Paris envious; and they carry them-
selves with almost oriental dignity. There is nothing, so far
as I have seen, in the manners of Salt Lake City to make me
suspect the existence of that licentiousness of which so much
has been written. He believed that the negative representations of Mormons came universally "From anti-Mormons only".
Plural marriage used to justify immoral behavior with young girls.
Richard Abanes claims that church leaders sometimes used polygamy to take advantage of young girls for immoral purposes. Historian George D. Smith studied 153 men who took plural wives in the early years of Mormonism, and found that two of the girls were thirteen years old, 13 girls were fourteen years old, 21 were fifteen years old, and 53 were sixteen years old. LDS historian Todd Compton documented that Joseph Smith, Jr. was sealed to two girls of age 14 and two girls of age 16. During the era of polygamy in Utah, the New York Times reported in 1857 cases of girls aged 10 and 11 being married to old men, and noting that marriages of girls aged 14 was "a very common occurrence". Historian Stanley Hirshson also noted these practices and cites the New York Times and several other sources as support.
Brigham Young himself attempted to stamp out the practice of men being sealed to excessively young girls. In 1857, he stated "I shall not seal the people as I have done. Old Father Alread brought three young girls 12 & 13 years old. I would not seal them to him. They would not be equally yoked together...Many get their endowments who are not worthy and this is the way that devils are made."
Shortage of wives caused by plural marriage.
Richard Abanes argues that polygamy may have caused a shortage of brides in the early LDS community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that church leader Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I want you to understand that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.
Mormon scholars dispute the accuracy of the quote, as it cannot be corroborated by a second source such as the extensive (though incomplete) record of discourses in the Journal of Discourses. FairWiki suggests that it may be a paraphrase of the following quoted statement, which is authentic.
On another occasion, Kimball said "You are sent out as shepherds to gather the sheep together; and remember that they are not your sheep: they belong to Him that sends you. Then do not make a choice of any of those sheep; do not make selections before they are brought home and put into the fold." Critics of Mormonism interpret this to be a statement of "selecting" converts for plural marriages. However, in the paragraph immediately following the above quote, Kimball went on to say:
This would appear to contradict the critics' interpretation mentioned above.
Mormon apologists dispute that there was a shortage of women, and advocate that polygamy was used at least in part to care for women who did not have husbands or were widows. LDS historians George L. Mitton and Rhett S. James of FARMS cite Brigham Young as encouraging single men to marry, stating that the incidence of polygamy would thus be reduced.
The precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known, but studies indicate a maximum of 20-25% of LDS adults were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice.
Coercion and deception related to plural marriage.
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage, for example citing the case of Joseph Smith who warned some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife. In 1893, married LDS church member John D. Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not polygamous. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law. Ann Eliza Young, nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother. However, LDS scholar Hugh W. Nibley disputed this claim, arguing that Ann Eliza and her mother had sought the marriage.
Mormon apologists claim that these were isolated cases, and the vast majority of wives consented willingly to plural marriage.
Incest.
Critics of polygamy in the early LDS church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral. In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the marriage of John Bernhisel to his sister, Maria. In 1886, Lorenzo Snow said that brothers and sisters should be able to get married.
Public opposition and anti-Mormon agitation.
Opponents of the LDS Church found in polygamy a convenient "cause célèbre". Opposition to the Church, especially among former Mormons, frequently focused, not upon the drawbacks of polygamy as a marriage system, but upon polygamy as a symptom of the depravity of Mormonism and Mormons in general. Former LDS Church member and prominent critic Fanny Stenhouse wrote in 1875: It would be quite impossible, with any regard to propriety, to relate all the horrible results of this disgraceful system... Marriages have been contracted between the nearest of relatives; and old men tottering on the brink of the grave have been united to little girls scarcely in their teens; while unnatural alliances of every description, which in any other community would be regarded with disgust and abhorrence, are here entered into in the name of God.
The end of Polygamy in the LDS church.
1890 Manifesto.
In April 1889, Woodruff, then president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, "we mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it." Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing.
By September 1890, federal officials were preparing to seize the church’s four temples and the U.S. Congress had debated whether to extend the 1882 Edmunds Act so that "all" Mormons would be disenfranchised, not just those practicing plural marriage. The Supreme Court had already ruled in "Davis v. Beason" that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional.
Woodruff would later recount that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus Christ that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage. Woodruff announced the Manifesto on September 25 by publishing it in the church-owned "Deseret Weekly" in Salt Lake City. On October 6, 1890, during the 60th Semiannual General Conference of the church, the Manifesto was formally accepted by the church membership.
The Manifesto was the end of official church authorization for the creation of new plural marriages that violated local laws. It had no effect on the status of already existing plural marriages, and plural marriages continued to be performed in locations where it was believed to be legal. As Woodruff explained at the general conference where the Manifesto was accepted by the church, "his Manifesto only refers to future marriages, and does not affect past conditions. I did not, I could not, and would not promise that you would desert your wives and children. This you cannot do in honor." Despite Woodruff's explanation, some church leaders and members who were polygamous did begin to live with only one wife. However, the majority of Mormon polygamists continued to cohabit with their plural wives in violation of the Edmunds Act.
Aftermath, The Smoot Hearings, and the Second Manifesto.
Within six years of the announcement of the 1890 Manifesto, Utah had become a state and federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists subsided.
D. Michael Quinn and other Mormon historians have documented that some church apostles covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in Mexico and Canada because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions. However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250. Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto "officially ceased" the practice of plural marriage in the church, "the ending of the practice after the Manifesto was ... gradual."
However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including B.H. Roberts.<br>
Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and were examined in detail during a series of congressional hearings on whether the United States Senate should seat Mormon Apostle Reed Smoot, who was elected by the Utah legislature in 1903. The hearings began in 1904 and continued until 1907, when the Senate finally voted to seat him. During the hearings, Smoot was given a provisional seat on the Senate and was allowed to vote. Smoot's chief opponents in the Senate were Senators Fred Dubois of Idaho and Julius C. Burrows of Michigan, who heavily criticized the church for its practice of polygamy. However, the opposition against Smoot was not universal among the senators with Senators such as Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania making sympathetic remarks on the issue.
In response to the hearings, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a "Second Manifesto" in 1904 which reaffirmed the church's opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into or solemnize new plural marriages.
Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley each resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles due to disagreement with the church’s position on plural marriage. Plural marriage continues to be grounds for excommunication from the LDS Church. The cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalist movement.
Fundamentalist reactions to the end of polygamy.
The shift in doctrine regarding polygamy by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gave rise to several sects of Mormon fundamentalism including the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) and others.
Polygamy in the 20th Century.
Currently the LDS church does not sanction polygamy and considers practitioners to be apostate and worthy of excommunication. The church still confirms that polygamy is a divine doctrine, but that observation of the practice is currently prohibited by God. The Community of Christ does not, nor has ever adhered to the practice of polygamy. Notably, the FLDS church still adheres to the commandment as practiced in the early days of the movement. The LDS church (Strangite) does not observe polygamy, but recognizes the historical doctrine. Other sects in the Latter Day Saint movement have various opinions on the doctrine.

1985 1000 km of Spa

The 1985 1000 km Spa was the seventh round of the 1985 World Endurance Championship. It took place at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium on September 1, 1985. In the first half of the race the two leading drivers collided, which resulted in the death of defending Drivers Champion Stefan Bellof. The race organisers ended the competition early, and allowing the Martini Racing Lancia of drivers Mauro Baldi, Bob Wollek, and Riccardo Patrese to win their only victory of the year. It was also the last victory scored by the Lancia LC2.
Bellof accident.
The 1000 km of Spa was held only three weeks after Manfred Winkelhock was killed in an accident at the series' previous round, the 1000 km of Mosport. Halfway through the race, defending Drivers Champion Stefan Bellof in the Brun Motorsport Porsche 956 was battling for the race lead with 1982 and 1983 Drivers Champion Jacky Ickx in the Rothmans Porsche 962C. Ickx led Bellof out of the La Source hairpin and down the front stretch into the Eau Rogue corner, starting the 78th lap of the race. Both drivers had only just been handed their cars from their teammates during a pit stop five laps earlier.
Entering the left kink at the bottom of the hill, Bellof moved to the left of Ickx in an attempt to set up a pass for the immediate right-hander up the hill. Bellof's right front came into contact with Ickx's left rear, and both drivers spun up to the left up the hill, impacting the barriers. Ickx's car hit the wall on the right rear side, while Bellof went straight into the barriers, breaking through and hitting a secondary wall. Bellof's Porsche caught fire moments after the wreck. Ickx, able to climb from his car, attempted to aid safety workers in helping Bellof. During the caution period, members of the Brun team also arrived to aid in the rescue.
Although the fire was extinguished and the driver extracted from the wreckage within forty minutes, Stefan Bellof was pronounced dead only ten minutes later after he had reached the track hospital, although it was believed that he had actually died on impact. Out of respect for Bellof, the race organisers chose to end the event earlier than planned. The entire incident was recorded on an in-car camera that Ickx's 962C was carrying. Even after the accident, the camera continued to work, and was pointed in the direction of Bellof's wreckage.

<doc id="18237495" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18237495" title="Analog passthrough">
Analog passthrough

Analog passthrough is a feature found on some digital-to-analog television converter boxes. Boxes without analog passthrough only allow digital TV (ATSC standard) to be viewed on older, analog-only (NTSC standard) TVs. Those with analog passthrough allow both digital and analog television to be viewed on older TVs. 
Before digital television, passthrough originally existed for VCRs (and later PVRs and DVDRs), allowing the TV antenna or cable TV signal to pass through the VCR (with a slight insertion loss) to the TV set automatically when the VCR was turned off, or manually with a button on the remote control. Passthrough was turned off when the RF modulator (typically on TV channel 3 or 4 in North America) was on, as this F connector was originally the only way to send the VCR output to older TVs, until unmodulated composite video and RCA connectors became common.
The problem.
All digital-to-analog converter boxes have both an antenna input (which accepts the coaxial cable that formerly went directly to the TV) and an RF output (which now goes directly to the TV). They may also have additional outputs. Any converter box converts the digital signal for the current digital sub-channel to an analog signal (at the reduced screen resolution of the analog standard), outputs that signal onto analog channel 3 or 4 (set by the user to avoid any conflict with local over-the-air channels) and sends that signal to the analog tuner in the TV. With a box that lacks analog passthrough, no other signals are sent to the output, so all analog stations are lost.
In the US, this primarily affects low-power and broadcast translator stations, as these are exempt from the FCC mandate to switch to digital broadcasting in 2009, as well as foreign signals that will remain in analog form. A small number of TV receivers were also manufactured with built-in broadcast radio receivers; these included some small portable devices or (more rarely) sets marketed for hotel/motel use. If used with DTV converter boxes, these will need analog passthrough in order not to block incoming FM radio signals.
Workarounds.
There are several approaches used with converter boxes that lack analog passthrough:
None of these solutions are ideal, however, requiring additional hardware (A-B boxes, splitters, or additional antennae or TVs) or manual intervention to change between digital and analog TV.
The solution.
Some converter boxes offer analog passthrough, meaning that the same output cable which carries the converted digital signal (on analog channel 3 or 4) while the converter is operating also retains all remaining analog signals upon turning the converter box off.
While this typically works to some extent with the converter box on, there is often significant signal strength reduction and/or interference on the original analog channels. 
Note that analog passthrough signals are only passed to the coax output, not to any other outputs provided by the unit. While other converter outputs may still be connected and used for digital TV reception, the coaxial RF output must remain connected to pass analog TV signals. 
For some VCRs (and, less often, TVs) this arrangement may cause a problem if the receiver uses the presence of active composite video or S-video connections to indicate that the signal should be accepted from those sources only. In such a case the two options would be to use the coax output exclusively, either when viewing analog TV only (which requires plugging and unplugging cables) or full-time (with the reduced digital TV quality produced using the coax output). 
The majority of TVs have a button on the unit and/or remote labeled something like "TV/VIDEO", "INPUT" or "AUX" which manually switches between coax and other sources, ensuring no problems when using both sets of connections simultaneously.
United States implementation.
In the US, conversion to digital TV from analog was complete by June 12, 2009. There are exceptions, however:
Many will want to continue to receive analog stations both before and beyond the February, 2009 transition date. In setting its requirements for coupon-eligible converter boxes (CECBs), the NTIA permits, but does not require, analog passthrough as an available feature.
Unfortunately, only one of the initially available converter boxes included this feature, and a year before the original transition date of Feb. 17, 2009, Community Broadcasters Association president Ron Bruno said four of 32 NTIA-certified boxes had the feature. In late March 2008, the CBA filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seeking an injunction to halt the sale and distribution of DTV converter boxes, charging that their failure to include analog tuners or analog passthrough violates the All-Channel Receiver Act. CBA maintained that the lack of analog support would seriously harm the LPTV and class A television stations the group represents, as it is cost-prohibitive for many or most of them to convert to digital transmissions, and the new boxes would prevent viewers from being able to watch (or even being aware of the existence of) their analog-only stations.
Responding to CBA's actions, the FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include the feature voluntarily in all converter boxes, and manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature. Some new DVD recorders and personal video recorders also provide both analog and digital tuners, and therefore could perform the basic functions of a set-top box in both modes.
In early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment, effectively telling the association that it had not exhausted all its efforts, and that there was not enough merit to take the case to the courts. The CBA responded by concentrating its lobbying efforts on the FCC, and by urging more funding for low power and Class A broadcasters to transition to digital, asking Congress to increase the number of such stations eligible for funds.

Sputnik (singer)

Knut T. Storbukås (born 23 April 1943), more commonly known by his stage name, Sputnik, is a musician and truck driver from Bostrak in the village of Tørdal which is in the municipality of Drangedal, Telemark. His most well known songs are "Skilles Johanne" () og "Lukk opp din hjertedør" Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In).
In only a few years, Storbukås sold more than one million cassettes, and set records in a series of places where he performed. He was rated as artist of the year in Norway in 1990, and in the fall of 1993 he got into the The Guinness Book of World Records when he performed thirty-six times in locations from Mandal in the south to Tromsø in the north in the period of only 72 hours.
During Easter in 1990, he was in the Soviet Union and was a part of the most original music video that a Norwegian had ever made at the time. Under glasnost, Sputnik stood in Red Square in Moscow and sang "Lukk opp din hjertedør". The video was later shown in its entirety in Norwegian on Dagsrevyen. Sputnik stole the show during the opening of TV2 in Grieghallen in the fall of 1992, in a duet with Kjell Bekkelund.
He has also performed in Sweden, Denmark, USA, Svalbard, Zanzibar, and Spain. However, most of all, he has performed hundreds of times in both big and small places around all of Norway. In the beginning, Sputnik received a harsh treatment from the critics, but he was loved by the people.
Today, Sputnik is a living legend, and a symbol of popularity in Norway. There are books written about Sputnik, and he has been mentioned in Stortinget. Norway's Prime Minister has visited Sputnik at his home, and each year thousands of his fans come to visit him at home in Bostrak. As a bunch of artists have done, in the USA and other places abroad, Sputnik has given everyone that wishes the permission to see his large collection of silver, gold, diamond, and platinum records in his own "Sputnik Museum".

3rd Alley

3rd Alley is an American band that originated in Long Beach, California. 3rd Alley formed in October 2004 after Zack Walters, then a solo artist, sent a four-track demo to Long Beach Records, landing on Greg "Mudd" Lowther's ears (of Falling Idols fame and co-owner of Long Beach Records). An epiphany by fellow-listener Tyson Parrish, lead to, "You gotta see if this guy needs a band!" Zack, Tyson and Mudd got together, started jamming, and 2 months later found themselves in front of sold out crowds supporting Long Beach Shortbus across America.
Career.
Singer/songwriter and lead guitarist, Zack Walters, got his feet wet fronting the San Diego band, Handful, which received substantial regional radio play, as well as, touring America as a solo artist performing experimental songs and techniques in front of the most varied crowds. Zack credits his sound to a "balance of ‘real’ and ‘abstract’ songwriting styles," and his ability to connect to the audience to "the fact that all the songs I write are based on real events and personal experiences of the everyday rollercoaster."
Todd Forman, Sublime saxophonist, joined 3rd Alley soon after hearing After School Special, declaring himself the "Forrest Gump of music". "I was fortunate to be alive when Brad, Eric, and Bud came along. Now I feel as fortunate to be around with Zack and 3rd Alley." As a seasoned veteran of the Long Beach music scene, Todd characterizes the 3rd Alley vibe as laid back hard rock. "Zack has a wonderful and rare gift of melody. Few singer/songwriters can produce something that catches you the first time you hear it. Zack is a rare bird indeed."
3rd Alley toured the U.S. and Europe in support of their debut album, After School Special.
The band toured in support of their 2nd album Shiny Shady People with 3 months of touring the U.S. and a tour of Europe in the October 2009. Out of the album came one music video for the song, "All My Friends are Flaky." Although other homemade videos have since been made as well, for "Evil Lurks" and "Galileo."
3rd Alley is completing their 3rd album tentatively titled "Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda" which will be released in 2011. The new album features guest artists such as Matt Brien formally of cult band Bargain Music and Simon Short from British punk band Captain Bud. In October 2010, a double single "Medicated & Bloodshot Eyes" was released digitally and available as hard copy on the band's online store. The full length album has a release date of June 28, 2011.

Michael Ableman

Michael Ableman is an American author, organic farmer, educator, and advocate for sustainable agriculture. He is founder the Center for Urban Agriculture at Fairview Gardens, California, Solefood Farms in Vancouver, and the Centre for Arts, Ecology and Agriculture on Salt Spring Island. Ableman is author of "From the Good Earth, On Good Land and Fields of Plenty: A Farmer's Journey in Search of Real Food and the People Who Grow It." He is featured in the award-winning PBS national broadcast "Beyond Organic."
Biography.
Ableman originally intended to become a photographer. However, in 1972 joined an agrarian commune east of Ojai, California where he was to eventually manage of pear and apple orchards. After a time managing a nursery on the coast north of Santa Barbara, in 1981 Ableman took a job grafting orange trees at Fairview Gardens. When the previous manager left, Ableman remained, "farm-sitting" until 2001. At its peak the farm served as an important community and education center and a national model for small scale and urban agriculture, hosting as many as 5000 people per year for tours, classes, festivals, and apprenticeships. Under Ableman's leadership the farm was saved from development and preserved under one of the earliest and most unique active agricultural conservation easements of its type in the country.
A frequent speaker at conferences throughout North America, Ableman gave a plenary presentation on the future of farming at the Bioneers conference in 2005. 
Ableman lives with his family on an organic farm on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.
Ableman now lives and farms at the historic 120 acre Foxglove Farm where he also directs the Center For Arts, Ecology, and Agriculture.
Michael is along with Seann Dory of SOLEFood Street Farms in Vancouver, British Columbia. Sole Food transforms vacant urban land into street farms that grow artisan quality fruits and vegetables and provides jobs to residents in the downtown Eastside of Vancouver who face for whatever reason challenges to employment. 
Michael Ableman and Seann Dory were brought together around a half-acre parking lot on Hastings and Hawks streets on the downtown east-side of Vancouver. Seann wanted to grow food and employ people from the neighborhood, Michael had the experience to make it happen.
Together they forged a working relationship and ultimately developed a very ambitious plan to create urban production farms throughout Vancouver that would employ individuals working through the challenges of material poverty, addiction, and mental illness while generating large quantities of food.

Parole bond

A parole bond is a deposit of money or property made to the government as surety that a paroled prisoner will not violate the terms of his release. The prisoner may fund the bond himself; or he may borrow from friends or family; or he may obtain the services of a bondsman, in exchange for a fee. Part of the theory behind it is that those who are asked to put up the money or cosign the loan have an incentive to verify that the parolee does not represent an unacceptably high risk prior to helping with his release; and they have an incentive to help him stay out of trouble after his release. The prisoner has an incentive to be on good behavior during his incarceration in order to demonstrate he has reformed and thus would not be at high risk of violating parole. While on parole, the prisoner has an incentive not to violate the terms, lest the bond be forfeited, which would likely cause difficulties in obtaining the surety of family, friends, or bondsmen in the future. Parole bonds are sometimes used as a way of relieving overcrowded prisons. It is based on the very similar concept of bail bonds; and just as with bail bonds, some statutes allow the bondsman to get back all or a portion of the bond by surrendering the prisoner to the authorities. This may require the use of bounty hunters to locate and capture him. Organizations like the National Association of Bail Insurance Companies and the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national bipartisan group of conservative legislators, have pressed the idea that financially secured postconviction release works far better than unsecured release.

Chonecetus

Chonecetus is an extinct genus of primitive baleen whale of the family "Aetiocetidae" that lived in the Oligocene period. Its fossils have been found in Canada, in the northeast Pacific. It was first named by L.S. Russell in 1968, and contains two species, "C. sookensis" and "C. goedertorum" (Barnes et al. 1995).
Like "Aetiocetus", "Chonecetus" possessed both multicusped teeth and the nutrient foramina required for baleen. "Chonecetus" closely resembled a modern Mysticeti, with an elongate, streamlined body supporting a pair of paddle-shaped forelimbs, and a horizontal tail fluke strengthened by fibrous cartilage.

International reaction to the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election

The events of the first and second rounds of the Zimbabwean presidential election, which Robert Mugabe of ZANU-PF won on 27 June 2008 after his challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), withdrew from the process and declared it illegitimate, caused reactions from many international bodies. Other Zimbabwean groups have denounced the poll as well (e.g. the Heads of the Christian Denominations in Zimbabwe.)
European Union.
Bernard Kouchner, the Foreign Minister of France, said on 1 July that the European Union would "accept no government other than a government led by Mr Tsvangirai". Italy chose to recall its ambassador to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean government spokesman George Charamba reacted fiercely to Western condemnation, saying that Western critics could "go hang a thousand times". Zimbabwe's Permanent Representative to the UN, Boniface Chidyausiku, was dismissive of the possibility of UN sanctions, saying that Zimbabwe was "not a threat to international peace and security."
On 10 July, the European Parliament voted for a motion calling on EU member states to impose increased sanctions on members of the Zimbabwean government; it also called on them to actively discourage the presence of European businesses in Zimbabwe. The motion said that the election was "not legitimate" and urged the suspension of Zimbabwe from African regional meetings. There were 591 votes in favour and 8 opposed.
On 13 July, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that pressure on the Zimbabwean government needed to be maintained and that his country would propose the addition of 36 names to the EU's list of 131 Zimbabweans subject to financial and travel sanctions.
The foreign ministers of the 27 EU member states agreed on 22 July to add 37 individuals to the list of individuals subject to EU sanctions; four companies were also added to the list. In a joint statement, the EU foreign ministers described the re-election of Mugabe as "illegitimate" and said that the new sanctions were directed "against those responsible for the campaign of violence that marked the elections"; they also said that additional action would follow if Mugabe remained in power. The foreign ministers also decided to further restrict Mugabe's ability to travel to EU countries; to travel there, he would need the approval of all EU member states, rather than a majority, as was previously the case. According to "The Herald", the EU's list of individuals subject to sanctions "was arrived at through 'malicious' submissions to the EU by some locals intending to settle personal scores." On 23 July, Angolan Foreign Minister João Bernardo de Miranda urged the EU to lift the sanctions, saying that they could interfere with negotiations between ZANU-PF and the MDC.
Following a preliminary agreement between ZANU-PF and the MDC on 21 July, outlining a framework for negotiations, Miliband described the agreement as a "first step"; he called for an end to violence and the lifting of a ban on international non-governmental organisations operating in Zimbabwe, saying that these conditions were necessary in order for "resolution of the Zimbabwean crisis" to begin.
African Union and SADC.
The South African Development Community (SADC) criticised the election in a statement on 29 June, saying that it "did not represent the will of the people of Zimbabwe" and that "the prevailing environment impinged on the credibility of the electoral process".
Desmond Tutu said on 29 June that there was "a very good argument" for sending "an international force to restore peace" to Zimbabwe. On 30 June, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga called for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the African Union (AU) until Zimbabwe holds free and fair elections; he also called for a new election in the presence of peacekeepers.
An AU summit at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt began on 30 June, with Mugabe in attendance. Despite the international prominence of the situation in Zimbabwe and concern from the West, Zimbabwe was reportedly not mentioned in the summit's opening speeches.
On 1 July, the AU summit passed a resolution calling for a "government of national unity" in Zimbabwe. The debate over the resolution saw the Vice-President of Botswana, Mompati Merafhe, criticise Mugabe and the "flawed election", saying that Zimbabwe should be suspended from AU and SADC meetings. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on 1 July that he would "spare no effort to work out a solution" and stressed that Zimbabweans needed to be able to vote without intimidation.
After the AU called for dialogue between ZANU-PF and the MDC, Mbeki said on 2 July that Mugabe was agreeable to this and expressed his commitment to dialogue; Tsvangirai, however, rejected dialogue, saying that violence and "persecution" must stop first.
The AU summit made no resolutions stronger than its call for dialogue and a national unity government, declining to adopt tough measures against Zimbabwe. Mugabe returned to Zimbabwe on 4 July and was welcomed by a celebratory crowd of about 4,000 at the airport in Harare.
Having previously called for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the AU and SADC, on 4 July Botswana's Foreign Minister, Phandu Skelemani, said that his country did not recognise the election's outcome and hoped that the rest of SADC would likewise refuse recognition. Skelemani called for "expedited" mediation in Zimbabwe within "a defined time frame" that would be based on "mutual trust and good faith" and equal standing between the parties. Mugabe had said at the summit that he was saddened by Botswana's position, and Sekelemani said that he hoped Mugabe would not take Botswana's position personally.
Mbeki met with Mugabe, as well as MDC faction leader Arthur Mutambara, in Zimbabwe on 5 July. On 6 July, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called on countries to "unite behind a tough, strong, clear Security Council resolution". This resolution, drafted by the United States, proposes that assets belonging to a number of leading political figures be frozen and that their ability to travel abroad be restricted. In addition, Miliband backed Tsvangirai's call for the appointment of an AU mediator, saying that "a clear mix of diplomacy and sanctions" was needed. Along with the US and the UK, France and Germany expressed support for the proposed resolution, but Russia, China, and South Africa did not. Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, suggested that the proposed resolution could establish a dangerous precedent, while South Africa expressed concern that it could harm Mbeki's mediation efforts.
G8 summit.
At a G8 summit in Hokkaidō, the G8 leaders declared in a statement on 8 July that they considered Mugabe's leadership to be illegitimate and announced that they planned to "take further steps ... against those individuals responsible for the violence". They additionally urged the Zimbabwean government to co-operate with the opposition and called for a UN envoy to be appointed to assess the situation in Zimbabwe. According to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the G8 statement "made it clear that we would appoint a U.N. envoy and would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime which has blood on its hands." However, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev was more cautious in his view of the statement's implications, saying that there were "as yet no concrete decisions on how the United Nations should act in this situation (and) whether it's necessary to make any special additional decisions". UN involvement in mediation is generally opposed by African governments, including that of South Africa.
Responding to the G8 statement on 8 July, Zimbabwean Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga accused the G8 leaders of trying to "undermine the African Union and President Mbeki's efforts because they are racist, because they think only white people think better", saying that this was "an insult to African leaders".
Speaking in Johannesburg on 10 July, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that the election was not free and fair and expressed support for the appointment of another "high profile" mediator to work alongside Mbeki.
United Nations Security Council.
The United Nations Security Council has officially met on the issue on several occasions.
On 23 June the Council heard a statement about the deteriorating situation and the restrictions imposed on outside election observers. Then, following an off-the-record meeting, the Council issued a statement condemning "the campaign of violence against the political opposition" and expressing "its concern over the impact of the situation in Zimbabwe on the wider region."
After the election an attempt, supported by the United States and European countries, to have the Security Council declare the election illegitimate was blocked by South Africa, which argued that the Council was not in the business of certifying elections. The US ambassador, who was President of the Security Council for June, told reporters that the holding of elections was "a matter of deep regret".
On 7 July the Security Council was briefed by the Deputy Secretary-General who said that observations "clearly indicate that the electoral process leading to the declared re-election of President Mugabe was seriously flawed. This profound crisis of legitimacy is further compounded by the paralysis of State institutions. There is currently no functioning parliament. Civil society has been silenced and intimidated. The economy is crippled, with annual inflation reaching 10.5 million per cent by the end of June and unemployment being over 80 per cent, and severe shortages of food and basic services exist. There is an urgent need to restore the rule of law and to start building public institutions."
The Zimbabwean mission to the UN said in a letter on 10 July that a proposed resolution drafted by the US would likely leave Zimbabwe in a lawless state like Somalia and cause a civil war if it was passed. According to the letter, Zimbabwe was not a threat to other countries and consequently there was no basis for the proposed resolution; the letter also alleged that the proposed resolution was actually intended as punishment for Zimbabwe's land reform, and it said that the US and the UK were "ignorreal, entrenched, fundamental and enduring issues that lie at the heart of Zimbabwe's internal politics". Additionally, the letter blamed the violence on the MDC.
On 11 July, this draft resolution was brought to the Security Council to impose personal sanctions involving finances and travel against Mugabe and 13 of his top associates, appoint a UN mediator, and impose an arms embargo against Zimbabwe. The resolution was vetoed by the negative votes of Russia and China. Belgium, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Croatia, France, Italy, Panama, the United Kingdom, and the United States voted in favour of the resolution; China, Libya, Russia, South Africa, and Vietnam voted against it, while Indonesia abstained.
The ambassador for Russia rejected the United Kingdom's interpretation of a recent statement at the G8 meeting that "We will take further steps, inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for violence" made any reference to actions in the Security Council. He added that such an attempt "to take the Council beyond its Charter prerogatives and beyond the maintenance of international peace and security... illegitimate and dangerous."
The ambassador for China stressed the importance of discussion between the political parties in Zimbabwe and said that the resolution would "interfere with the negotiating process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation".
South African Permanent Representative Dumisani Kumalo criticised the resolution for being biased in favour of the MDC and against ZANU-PF, and he urged the Security Council to give Mbeki's mediation a chance without potentially undermining it by imposing sanctions. He said that, even if sanctions were eventually deemed necessary, they should not be imposed immediately.
US Permanent Representative Zalmay Khalilzad was sharply critical of the positions taken by Russia and South Africa. Describing Mugabe's government as a "horrible regime", he said that Mbeki's mediation efforts were a failure, that no "serious" negotiations were taking place, and that it appeared Mbeki was protecting Mugabe and sometimes even working with him. He criticised Russia for what he characterised as a reversal of its position, noting that Russia had backed the G8 statement a few days prior. Khalilzad also said that the US could have considered an arrangement in which sanctions would only be imposed after the passage of a certain length of time, if those opposed to the resolution had chosen to negotiate. The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly rejected the accusation that Russia had reversed its position. British Foreign Secretary Miliband was also critical of Russia's opposition, saying that it would "appear incomprehensible to the people of Zimbabwe".
Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the Security Council vote, and he thanked "those who helped defeat international racism disguised as multilateral action at the UN". According to Ndlovu, the outcome upheld "the principles of non-interference into the sovereign affairs of a UN member state".
United States.
Immediately after the election, US President George W. Bush said on 28 June 2008 that the US would be imposing new sanctions on "this illegitimate government of Zimbabwe and those who support it", and he called for an international arms embargo on Zimbabwe and the barring of travel by members of its government.
Bush said on 15 July that he was unhappy with Russia and China's Security Council veto and that the US Departments of State and the Treasury were "working on potential US action". At a Senate hearing later on the same day, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer said that US sanctions were planned to target individuals as well as Zimbabwean government institutions, although she noted that European sanctions would be more effective because the Zimbabwean economy was more connected to Europe; she also criticised the Russian and Chinese veto, saying that it "enabled Mugabe". Also on 15 July, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that Mugabe's "tyranny" would cause "perennial instability" in southern Africa for as long as it existed.
Bush announced the signing of an order expanding sanctions on 25 July. The US Treasury Department identified 17 entities and one individual (Thamer Bin Saeed Ahmed al-Shanfari, an Omani businessman who is alleged to work with the Zimbabwean government, but who strongly denies these allegations and is taking major action to clear his name.) who would have any of their assets in the US frozen. Bush also said that if the talks "result in a new government that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, the United States stands ready to provide a substantial assistance package, development aid, and normalization with international financial institutions".
Canada.
In the immediate aftermath of the second round, Canada imposed sanctions restricting the activities of individual Zimbabwean government figures inside Canada. On 5 September, Canadian Foreign Minister David Emerson announced more sanctions aimed at "isolating and maintaining pressure on key members of the Zimbabwe regime", including the freezing of any assets they held in Canada, as well as placing a ban on the export of arms from Canada to Zimbabwe. It also banned Zimbabwean aircraft from flying over or landing in Canada.
Zimbabwean reaction to sanctions.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September, President Mugabe "appealto the world's collective conscience to apply pressure for the immediate removal of these sanctions by Britain, the United States and their allies, which have brought untold suffering to our people". He described the leaders behind the sanctions as "international perpetrators of genocide, acts of aggression and mass destruction".

Armand Blackmar

Armand Edward Blackmar, born in Vermont in 1826, to parents Reuben Harmon and Amanda (Cushman) Blackmar, was, with his brother, Henry, the founder of Blackmar Brothers, a music publishing company. Begun in 1860, this publishing company was originally based out of New Orleans, Louisiana, and later Augusta, Georgia. This would become the most successful publisher of music of the Confederacy American Civil War, issuing about half the songs released during that era. A.E. was best known for the patriotic songs he wrote.
Armand and Henry were music teachers before entering the publishing business. When Northern troops took over the city of New Orleans, Henry Blackmar moved the business to Augusta, while Armand - due to his Northern accent - managed to continue working out of New Orleans for a time, but a Union raid on his business forced him to cease working. He continued to live in Louisiana and published songs of his own, under a pseudonym, through his brother.
Blackmar's published work included, among others: "The Bonnie Blue Flag"; "Dixie War Song" (arranged and published); "(State Song) Maryland! My Maryland!"; "Southern Marseillaise"; and "The Beauregard Manassas".
Henry Blackmar continued to operate the Blackmar publishing house out of Augusta, Georgia, extending their distribution chain throughout the South. Following the Civil War, in addition to efforts in the game of chess, Armond continued to publish music and sell it in several sites in the United States. He returned to New Orleans and reopened a music store there. Additionally, his brother, Henry operated an additional music store of his own that was also located in New Orleans. Armond died several years after returning to New Orleans.
During the contentious Civil War years, Armand Edward additionally worked as a lawyer in New Orleans.
In 1881 and 1882, A.E. Blackmar created Blackmar's Gambit, a chess opening, and published his work in the July 1882 issue of "Brentano’s Chess".
Armand Edward Blackmar was married to Margaret Bridget Meara of New Orleans, Louisiana.

RePOP

RePOP is a load-balancing proxy server specific to the POP3 protocol. 
It operates by answering the initial POP3 handshake and authentication request from a POP3 client. 
RePOP obtains the username from the USER request from the POP3 client, and then looks for the location of the user's home POP3 server in a database. RePOP then initiates a connection to the requested user's home POP3 and reissues the USER request to the POP3 server. A standard proxy connection is connected through the RePOP server directly from the POP3 client to the user's home POP3 server for the remainder of the POP3 session. 
History.
RePOP was initially conceptualized and developed by Patrick Tiquet at JPS.net Internet Services in 1997.
Tiquet continued to oversee development and deployment into the JPS.net e-mail system until his departure from JPSnet in 1999. RePOP continued to serve as an integral part of JPS.net's mail system through their acquisition by Onemain.com and eventually Earthlink.net. 
RePOP was retired from use by Earthlink.net when e-mail was migrated to a new e-mail system. 
Repop Status.
RePOP was developed as the intellectual property of JPS.net. There were attempts by developers in 1999 and 2000 to release the source code into the open source community. Today, the source code is currently not available for download on the internet. The ownership and licensing status of the RePOP source code is unknown. 
RePOP Today.
There are currently no known RePOP servers in use as of 2008.

<doc id="18238424" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18238424" title="Heider SV">
Heider SV

Heider SV is a German association football club from the city of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein. The club was founded 14 October 1925 by what was the reserve side of "VfL 05 Heide". The reservists thought they were the better side and challenged the first team to a match, which they won. Despite this, no changes were made to the first team roster, so the reservists left to form "SV".
__TOC__
History.
Small town on the big stage.
The team is known popularly as "kleiner HSV" (en: Little HSV), a play on the name of better known "Hamburger SV". They represented the smallest town competing in top-flight German competition in the regional Oberliga Nord (I) in 1956–57 and 1960–61 against the likes of larger clubs including "Hamburger SV", "Hannover 96", "Werder Bremen", and "FC St.Pauli". The club's appearances in the top flight were brief, but they were enthusiastically supported, regularly drawing large crowds. The highlight of "Heider"'s 1956–57 season was a 2:0 victory over "Hamburger SV" before a crowd of 12,000, an attendance record that still stands to this day.
In 1951, 1953, and 1955, "Heider" took part in the country's amateur championship with their best result coming as an advance to the semi-finals in 1955 where they were put out by "Sportfreunde Siegen" (1:3). The club also made failed attempts to return to Oberliga play in 1954, 1958, 1959, and 1962.
Post-Bundesliga.
After the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's first fully profession league, in 1963, "Heider" became part of the Amateurliga Schleswig-Holstein (III) after failing to qualify for the new Regionalliga Nord (II). The team did eventually win its way to the Regionalliga for a single season turn in 1968–69, and again for a four season stint in 1970–74. After slipping down through the Amateurliga, "SV" became a fixture in fourth tier play in the Landesliga Schleswig-Holstein (1975–78), the Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein (1978–94), and the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (1994–2004), before finally falling to fifth tier play in the Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein in 2004. Although generally a mid-table finisher, "Heider" continued to field competitive sides through the years, earning four second place results, as well as a Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein (IV) title in 1982–83.
The club has made occasional appearances in competition for the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), but has never advanced out of the opening round.
After losing a promotion round playoff to "Arminia Hannover" in 1997, the club struggled, delivering poor performances, losing the support of its fans and sponsors, and facing financial problems. Their situation has since stabilized and they currently play as a lower table side in the Verbandsliga Schleswig-Holstein (V), finishing 5th in the 2007–08 season.
Stadium.
"SV" plays its home matches in the Stadion an der Meldorfer Straße, which has a capacity of 11,000 (1,500 seats).

John Young (baseball)

John Thomas Young (born February 9, 1949) is an American former professional baseball player. He has also scouted and worked in the front office. Young played in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1971. He founded Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, a youth baseball program aimed at increasing participation among African Americans in baseball.
Early life.
Young was born in Los Angeles, California, and graduated from Mount Carmel High School.
Playing career.
The Cincinnati Reds drafted Young in the 27th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. Rather than sign with the Reds, Young chose to enroll at Chapman College, where he played for the school's baseball team. He was drafted again in the first round, with the 16th overall selection, of the 1969 MLB Draft by the Detroit Tigers, and he signed. He played two games in Major League Baseball at first base for the Detroit Tigers in 1971, going 2-for-4 with a double and a run batted in. After the 1974 season, the Tigers traded Young to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ike Brookens.
Scouting career.
Young rejoined the Tigers as a minor league instructor in 1978, and became a scout for the Tigers in 1979. He was named their director of scouting in 1981. He also scouted for the Baltimore Orioles, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, and Florida Marlins.
Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities.
While scouting for the Orioles, Young discovered that there were few African American players chosen in the 1986 MLB Draft. After presenting his findings to Orioles' general manager Roland Hemond and MLB Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Ueberroth contacted Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, who agreed to fund a youth baseball program in Los Angeles, providing $50,000. Young also received funding from the Amateur Athletic Union.
Young organized 12 teams of 180 13- and 14-year-olds for Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) in 1989. He obtained help from African American players, including Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis, who are from Southern California. MLB assumed operation of the RBI program in 1991.

Tricyanoaminopropene

Tricyanoaminopropene (TRIAP, TCAP, Malononitrile Dimer, 1,1,3-tricyano-2-amino-1-propene) is a nootropic drug which mimics the function of nerve growth factor and increases the growth of nerves and tissue regeneration both in isolated tissues and "in vivo". It stimulates the action of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, resulting in increased acetylcholine production. This then results in increased synthesis of RNA in many different tissues in the body. However it also suppresses the production of thyroxine, causing temporary hypothyroidism which returns to normal once the drug is discontinued.
Tricyanoaminopropene reduces the amnesia produced by electroconvulsive shock, and animal tests suggested nootropic activity, but no beneficial effect was found when it was tested in retarded children, and administration to pregnant rats actually reduced learning ability in their young because of its anti-thyroid hormone effects. This drug thus produces two effects which oppose each other, with the nootropic effect from the increased acetylcholine production cancelled out by the opposite effect produced by the decrease in production of thyroxine. It is not known whether the efficacy of the drug could be improved by supplementation with additional thyroxine or equivalent drugs.

Courtyard housing

Courtyard Housing is a distinct medium density multi-family housing typology centred on a shared outdoor open space or garden and surrounded by one or two storeys of apartment units typically only accessed by courtyard from the street (and not by an interior corridor). The Courtyard Housing typology developed in the Los Angeles area in the 1920s by several small scale developers in response to the region's climate and housing needs and which typically adopted a Mediterranean or Spanish Colonial architectural style. The courtyards would be quiet and shaded outdoor spaces that served as a transition between the street and the individual apartment units and were primarily aesthetic in nature and non-recreational space. In the years following, the typology was implemented across the United States until around the time of World War II when the automobile became more dominant to daily life and had more of an impact on the built environment when then-newer housing typologies were developed in response such as the dingbat.
In recent years the Courtyard Housing typology has re-emerged following the publication of the book "Courtyard Housing in Los Angeles" by Stephanos Polyzoides as well as to suit a contemporary need for a housing typology with a density level between that of a single or double family house and that of a traditional higher-density apartment building. In 2007, the City of Portland Planning Bureau held a design competition for new designs based on the Courtyard Housing model for new infill housing in existing neighborhoods.
While courtyards have been a part of buildings for millennia, Courtyard Housing in this sense does not refer merely to any housing structure with a courtyard.

Rob Ellis (baseball)

Robert Walter Ellis (born July 3, 1950 in Grand Rapids, Michigan) is a professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers. Since his retirement as a player, Ellis has served as a coach and manager in college baseball and minor league baseball. He has also written screenplays and books.
After a successful collegiate career for the Michigan State Spartans, the Brewers drafted Ellis in 1971 and brought him straight to the major leagues. He played for the Brewers during the 1971, 1974, and 1975 seasons. Over the course of his MLB playing career, Ellis played in a total of just 64 games spread out over three seasons, about half as an outfielder, with the rest as a third baseman and designated hitter. He played in the minor leagues until 1980.
Playing career.
Ellis attended Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he starred in baseball and American football. Drafted by the San Francisco Giants in 1968, he did not sign, as he hoped for a team that would promote him to the major leagues quickly. Ellis then attended Michigan State University, where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans baseball team. Ellis batted .380 as a sophomore and .431 as a junior. He set Spartans single-season records with 14 home runs, 60 hits, 13 doubles, and 123 total bases. Ellis was voted college player of the year in 1971 by "The Sporting News". Ellis was named to the All-American squad that same year.
The Washington Senators were expected to choose Ellis with the first overall selection in the June 1971 secondary draft. Instead, the Senators chose pitcher Pete Broberg. After the Chicago Cubs selected Burt Hooton with the second pick, the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Ellis with the third selection. The Brewers immediately promoted him to the majors, bypassing minor league baseball. Ellis was the fourth player to go straight to the Major Leagues after being drafted without spending a day in the minors. The Brewers sold Mike Hegan to the Oakland Athletics, naming Ellis their starting first baseman. The Brewers expected success from Ellis, comparing him to Chris Chambliss.
This turned out to be premature, as Ellis batted just .198 in 36 games that year and was sent to the minors. The Brewers demoted Ellis to the Evansville Triplets of the Class AAA American Association, where he batted .300. In 1972, Ellis played for the San Antonio Brewers of the Class AA Texas League and Evansville. He spent all of the 1973 season with Evansville.
Ellis began the 1974 season with the Brewers. Despite hitting .298 in 47 at-bats, the second best batting average on the team, the Brewers demoted Ellis to the Sacramento Solons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in June, when they acquired Deron Johnson from the Oakland Athletics. Ellis batted .296 for the Solons in 1974. In 1975, Ellis suffered an arm injury in spring training, and the Brewers returned him to Sacramento. Ellis spent all of the 1975 season with the Solons, with the exception of six games played with Milwaukee. Ellis batted .250 with the Solons in 1975. After the 1975 season, Ellis took out an advertisement in "The Sacramento Union" apologizing to the fans of Sacramento for his low batting average.
Ellis remained with Brewers' affiliates, playing for the Spokane Indians of the PCL in 1976 and 1977. A free agent after the 1977 season, Ellis signed with the Cleveland Indians organization for the 1978 season, and played for the Portland Beavers in 1978 and Tacoma Tugs in 1979, both in the PCL. He was sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates during the 1979 season, who assigned him to Portland for the remainder of the 1979 season, and for 1980.
Coaching career.
After he retired, Ellis became a coach in minor league baseball for the Chicago Cubs organization in 1983. He then served as an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1985 through 1990. He also coached the Anchorage Glacier Pilots, a collegiate summer baseball team in the Alaska Baseball League.
In 1991, Ellis managed the Everett Giants of the Northwest League from August 11 until the end of the season, replacing Mike Bubalo. The team went 26-27 under Ellis, but he was not retained as manager for the 1992 season. Ellis served as a roving hitting instructor for the Baltimore Orioles organization from 1995 through 1997. He was named hitting instructor for the New Britain Rock Cats of the Class AA Eastern League in 1998, and also served in the role in 1999.
Personal.
Ellis has a master's degree in psychology.
Ellis wrote an autobiographical book, titled "The Outfielder", which was not published. He also wrote a screenplay, titled "The Tundra Ghost", which was inspired by his time as an extra on "The Slugger's Wife". With Mike Schmidt, Ellis co-wrote ""The Mike Schmidt Study, Hitting Theory, Skills and Technique"".

C-Star-class blimp

__NOTOC__
The C-Star class (sometimes written as C*-class) of blimps were used by Britain's Royal Naval Air Service for convoy escort duties during World War I. Developed from the Coastal class (often referred to as the "C class"), the "*" in their designation indicated a modification of the original class which they slowly replaced in service. 
The C-Star class were slightly larger than their predecessors. With an endurance of up to 30 hours, and more powerful (and reliable) Renault engines, the C*s had the same basic layout as the Coastal Class, with the same trilobe envelope. However, the envelope tapered towards the rear, as on the SSZ class, which greatly improved stability, as did the larger control surfaces.

Old Trail Town

Old Trail Town is a collection of historic western buildings and artifacts, dating from 1879—1901, located off the Yellowstone Highway in the resort city of Cody, the seat of Park County in northwestern Wyoming. Much of the collection was derived from within 150 miles of Cody, the town that Buffalo Bill and his associates surveyed and established in 1895.
Restored cabins.
One of the assembled buildings is the log cabin of the Crow Indian named Curly, a scout to General George Armstrong Custer, who escaped prior to hostilities at the Little Big Horn in Montana on June 25, 1876. In 1885, the United States government constructed Curly’s cabin as a reward for his military service.
Kid Curry (Harvey Logan) and the Sundance Kid used a cabin at Old Trail Town as a hide-out before they robbed a bank in Red Lodge, Montana. Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and other desperados met at another cabin brought in from the Hole-in-the-Wall country in north central Wyoming. It was built in 1883 by Alexander Ghent.
Historical perspective.
Trail Town began in 1967 through the efforts of Bob W. Edgar, (born January 1, 1939), an archeologist and a native of the Big Horn Basin region of Wyoming. Edgar explored the area and worked for seven years for the large Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody. He realized the need to gather the historic buildings and relics and display them at a common site, the actual location where Buffalo Bill Cody and his associates had surveyed the first town site, "Cody City". 
Trail Town has more than twenty-five buildings, a hundred horse-drawn vehicles, and an extensive collection of memorabilia of the Wyoming frontier. The largest collection of its kind in Wyoming, Old Trail Town has enjoyed the support of area ranchers and the Cody community. Visitors can stroll between buildings along the boardwalk and access the cemetery, where some local and national folk heroes are interred.
Liver-Eating Johnson's grave.
On June 8, 1974, the grave of mountain man Liver-Eating Johnson (ca. 1824—1900) was relocated to Old Trail Town. Johnson's legendary exploits were brought to film with Robert Redford in "Jeremiah Johnson". Originally “Johnston”, John Johnson was a trapper, hunter, United States Army scout, marshal, and Union veteran of the American Civil War. More than two thousand attended the reburial service, perhaps the largest such gathering in Wyoming history. The bronze statue of Johnson erected over his grave is the work of Peter M. Fillerup (born ca. 1954) of Cody. It was dedicated on July 3, 1981.
Museum access.
Old Trail Town is open from May 15 until September 30. Admission is $8 for adults, $7 for seniors, and $4 for children 6-12.
The Museum of the Old West, a separate entity within Old Trail Town established in 1971 as a 501(C)(3) Not for Profit Corporation by Bob Edgar and Frances Beldon, is seeking to purchase and administer Old Trail Town provided the financing can be secured.

Hindenburg-class airship

__NOTOC__
The two "Hindenburg"-class airships were passenger carrying rigid airships built in Germany in the 1930s and named in honor of Paul von Hindenburg. They were the last such aircraft ever built, and in terms of their length and volume, the largest aircraft ever to fly. During the 1930s, airships like the "Hindenburg" class were widely considered the future of air travel, and the lead ship of the class, LZ 129 "Hindenburg", established a regular transatlantic service. The destruction of this same ship in a spectacular and highly publicized accident was to prove the death knell for these expectations. The second ship, LZ 130 "Graf Zeppelin" was never operated on a regular passenger service, and was scrapped in 1940 at the order of Hermann Göring.
Design and development.

The "Hindenburg" class were built to an all-duralumin design. The leader of the design team was Doctor Ludwig Dürr, who had overseen the design of all Zeppelins except LZ-1 (on which he was a crew member), under the overall direction of Hugo Eckener, the head of the company. They were long and in diameter, longer than three Boeing 747s placed end-to-end, longer than four current Goodyear Blimps end-to-end, and only shorter than the . The previous largest airship was the British R101 777 ft (236.83 m) long and 40 m wide completed in 1929. (Edit: The American Airships USS Akron/Macon, flying aircraft carriers of the US Navy were the largest airships at 239 meters long (785 feet), 118/122 tons, 144 feet wide and 155/146.5 feet tall- The Akron was in service from 1931-1933, and the Macon from 1933-1935)
The design originally called for cabins for 50 passengers and a crew complement of 40.
Construction of the first ship, LZ 129, later named "Hindenburg", began in 1931, but was suddenly stopped when Luftschiffbau Zeppelin went bankrupt. This led Eckener to make a deal with the Nazi Party which came to power in 1933. He needed money to build the airship, but in return he was forced to display the swastikas on the tail fins. Construction then resumed in 1935. The keel of the second ship, LZ 130 "Graf Zeppelin" was laid on June 23, 1936, and the cells were inflated with hydrogen on August 15, 1938. As the second Zeppelin to carry the name "Graf Zeppelin" (after the LZ 127), she is often referred to as "Graf Zeppelin II".
The duralumin frame was covered by cotton cloth varnished with iron oxide and cellulose acetate butyrate impregnated with aluminium powder. The aluminium was added to reflect both ultraviolet, which damaged the fabric, and infrared light, which caused heating of the gas. This was an innovation with the LZ 126 which was taken as war reparations by the US and served as the USS "Los Angeles" (ZR-3) from 1924 until decommissioned in 1933. Following the destruction of "Hindenburg", the doping compound for the outer fabric covering of "Graf Zeppelin" was changed: bronze and graphite were added to prevent flammability and also improved the outer covering's electrical conductivity. 
The rigid structure was held together by many large rings up to the size of a Ferris wheel, 15 of which were gas cell boundaries which formed bulkheads. These bulkheads were braced by steel wires which connected up into the axial catwalk. The longitudinal duralumin girders connected all the rings together and formed "panels". The 16 gas cells were made of cotton and a gas tight material. On "Graf Zeppelin", the cells were lightened and one was made of lightweight silk instead of cotton.
Hydrogen was vented out through valves on the top of the ship. These valves could be controlled both manually and automatically. An axial catwalk was added across the center of the ship to provide access to the gas valves. A keel catwalk provided access to the crew quarters and the engines. Alongside the keel were water ballast and fuel tanks. The tail fins of the airship were over in length, and were held together with a cross-like structure. The lower tail fin also had an auxiliary control room in case the controls in the gondola malfunctioned.
"Hindenburg" was powered by four reversible Daimler-Benz diesel engines which gave the airship a maximum speed of . The engine pods were completely redesigned for "Graf Zeppelin", using diesel engines powering tractor propellers (the aft port engine was the only one to have a three bladed prop). The engines had a water recovery system which captured the exhaust of the engines to minimize weight lost during flight. 
To reduce drag, the passenger rooms were contained entirely within the hull, rather than in the gondola as on the LZ 127 "Graf Zeppelin" and consisted of two decks. The upper deck, "A", contained the passenger quarters, public areas, a dining room, a lounge, and a writing room. The lower deck, "B", contained washrooms, a mess hall for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Long slanted windows ran the length of both decks. The passenger decks were redesigned for "Graf Zeppelin"; the restaurant was moved to the middle of the quarters and the promenade windows were half a panel lower.
Lift gas.
"Hindenburg" was originally designed for helium, heavier than hydrogen but nonflammable. Most of the world's supply of helium comes from natural gas fields in the United States, which had banned its export under the Helium Control Act (1927). Eckener expected this ban to be lifted, but to save helium the design was modified to have double gas cells (an inner hydrogen cell protected by an outer helium cell). The ban remained however, so the engineers used only hydrogen despite its extreme flammability. It held of gas in 16 bags or cells with a useful lift of approximately . This provided a margin above the average gross weight of the ship with fuel, equipment, of mail and cargo, about 90 passengers and crew and their luggage. 
The Germans had extensive experience with hydrogen as a lifting gas. Accidental hydrogen fires had never occurred on civilian Zeppelins, so the switch from helium to hydrogen did not cause much concern. Hydrogen also increased lift by about 8%. After the "Hindenburg" disaster Eckener vowed never to use hydrogen again in a passenger airship. He planned to use helium for the second ship and went to Washington, D.C. to personally lobby President Roosevelt, who promised to supply the helium only for peaceful purposes. After the annexation of Austria in March 1938, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes refused to supply the gas, and the "Graf Zeppelin" was also filled with hydrogen.
Operational history.
LZ 129 "Hindenburg".
"Hindenburg" made her first flight on 4 March 1936, but before commencing her intended role as a passenger liner, was put to use for propaganda purposes by the Nazi government. Together with LZ 127 "Graf Zeppelin", she spent four days dropping leaflets, playing music, and making radio broadcasts in the lead up to the March 29 plebiscite mandating Hitler's Chancellorship and remilitarization of the Rhineland.
Commercial services commenced on 31 March 1936 with the first of seven round trips to Rio de Janeiro that "Hindenburg" was to make during her first passenger season. Together with ten round trips to New York, "Hindenburg" covered that year with 2,798 passengers and 160 tons of freight and mail.
Following refurbishment during the winter, "Hindenburg" set out on her first flight to North America for the 1937 season (she had already made one return trip to South America in 1937) on 3 May, bound for New York. This flight would end in tragedy with "Hindenburg" being utterly consumed by fire as she prepared to dock at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey.
LZ 130 "Graf Zeppelin".
By the time the "Graf Zeppelin" was completed, it was obvious that the ship would never serve its intended purpose as a passenger liner; the lack of a supply of inert helium was one cause. The ship was christened and made her first flight on September 14, 1938, making a circuit from Friedrichshafen to München, Augsburg, Ulm, and back. The total distance covered was . The "Graf Zeppelin" made a total of thirty flights, mainly spy missions for the Luftwaffe.
Scrapping.
In April 1940, Hermann Göring issued the order to scrap both "Graf Zeppelin" and the unfinished framework of LZ 131, since the metal was needed for other aircraft. By April 27, work crews had finished cutting up the airships. On May 6, the enormous airship hangars in Frankfurt were leveled by explosives, three years to the day after the destruction of the "Hindenburg".

Reino Häyhänen

Reino Häyhänen, (born May 14, 1920, near Leningrad) was an ethnic Finn Soviet Lieutenant Colonel who defected to the United States.
Birth and education.
Born to peasants, Häyhänen rose above his modest background to become an honor student and, in 1939, obtained the equivalent of a certificate to teach high school. In September, 1939, Häyhänen was appointed to the primary school faculty in the village of Lipitzi. Two months later, however, he was conscripted by the Communists' secret police, the NKVD. Since he had studied the Finnish language and was very proficient in its use, Häyhänen was assigned as an interpreter to an NKVD group and sent to the combat zone to translate captured documents and interrogate prisoners during the Winter War. With the end of this war in 1940, Häyhänen was assigned to check the loyalty and reliability of Soviet workers in Finland and to develop informants and sources of information in their midst. His primary objective was to identify anti-Soviet elements among the intelligentsia.
Häyhänen became a respected expert in Finnish intelligence matters and in May, 1943, was accepted into membership in the Soviet Communist Party. Following World War II, he rose to the rank of senior operative authorized representative of the Segozerski district section of the NKGB and, with headquarters in the village of Padani, set about the task of identifying dissident elements among the local citizens.
In the summer of 1948, Häyhänen was called to Moscow by the KGB where he met his wife, Akilina Pavolva. The Soviet intelligence service had a new assignment for Häyhänen - one which would require him to sever relations with his family, to study the English language, and to receive special training in photographing documents, as well as to encode and decode messages.
While his KGB training continued, Häyhänen worked as a mechanic in the city of Valga, Estonia. Then, in the summer of 1949, he entered Finland as Eugene Nicolai Mäki, an American-born laborer. He would later be stationed in the United States.
Defection.
In May 1957, Häyhänen telephoned the United States Embassy in Paris and arrived at the Embassy for an interview. He said: "I'm an officer in the Soviet intelligence service. For the past five years, I have been operating in the United States. Now I need your help." He had been ordered to return to Moscow, after five years in the United States, and now wanted to defect.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had obtained a hollowed-out nickel, the Hollow Nickel Case, in June, 1953, the nickel contained microfilm with a series of numbers on it; however, until Häyhänen's contact, the bureau had been unable to discover its provenance. With his help the FBI was able to link the nickel to KGB agents, including Mikhail Nikolaevich Svirin (an ex-United Nations employee) and Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (aka Rudolph Ivanovich Abel).
Häyhänen was being recalled to Moscow for good, and defected on the way back in Paris. The deciphered message in the nickel turned out to be worthless, a personal message to Häyhänen from the KGB in Moscow welcoming him to the U.S. and instructing him on getting set up. However, he would give the FBI the information that it needed to crack the cipher, uncover the identity of his two main contacts in New York (Svirin and Fisher), and a nearly identically-made Finnish 50 Markka coin.
In addition to Svirin and Fisher (code name "Mark"), Häyhänen (code name "Vic") told the FBI about Vitali G. Pavlov, onetime Soviet embassy official in Ottawa; Aleksandr Mikhailovich Korotkov; and U.S. Army Sergeant, Roy Rhodes (code name "Quebec"), who had once worked in the garage of the U.S. embassy in Moscow. The KGB was able to get to Rhodes because it had "compromising materials" about him. Häyhänen and Fisher were in the United States mainly looking for information on the U.S. atomic program and U.S. Navy submarine information.
According to the book "Negotiator: The Life And Career of James B. Donovan" by Phillip J. Bigger, at page 254, Reino Häyhänen died in a "mysterious" automobile accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1961.

Throw the Fight

Throw the Fight is an American alternative rock band originating from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
History.
"The Fire Within".
Throw the Fight started out as a five-piece group in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band recorded several demos and an eponymous three song EP with lead vocalist Brandon Kyllo. Years later, Paul Kreuger replaced Brandon as the band's vocalist and, collaboratively, the group began writing and recording their next EP, "The Fire Within". While still recording their EP, which consisted of four tracks, Throw the Fight was voted as one of the Top Ten Unsigned Bands in the country by Alternative Press in 2006. Shortly after, Throw the Fight signed with Cordless Recordings - a digital label that is part of the Warner Music Group. With the widespread attention provided by the article and after garnering a larger fanbase, the band collectively decided to begin touring in support of the newly recorded EP. After a year and a half of touring, a lineup change occurred as James Clark replaced Paul who provided vocals for the band. Though previously a fundamentally sound musical group, Throw the Fight believed James fit in perfectly with the band's overall style and his sound better reflected the desired tone of the band. The new front man provided a new sound for the band, one that attracted Minnesota producer Matt Kirkwold.
"In Pursuit of Tomorrow".
With moderate mainstream acclaim from the EP, Throw the Fight continued to write and record songs for their first album. Receiving mostly positive reviews, "In Pursuit of Tomorrow" carried musical range from intense, screaming guitar melodies to classic metal to melancholy tones. Throw the Fight, mainly concerned with their impression on their following, felt they had to stay true to their fan base with their first true album. Attributing their success mainly to a particular "X Factor" unseen in other acts, they have also admitted that unity and teamwork within the band have aided in their accomplishments. They are currently in the studio writing and tracking new material for their second album.
"New demo material - 2010".
The band is currently unsigned and recording / shopping new demo material for their third release while touring full time. They released their new single, Bloodshot Eyes, on July 20, 2010. The song can be heard online and is available digitally through iTunes, Amazon Mp3, Shockhound, Emusic and more.
"John Feldmann confirmed to produce the band's second album".
Throw the Fight announced on April 11, 2011 that John Feldmann (Story of the Year, The Used, Atreyu) will be producing the band's second album. A release date has yet to be determined.
"Throw The Fight sign to Bullet Tooth Records / "What Doesn't Kill Us" in stores & online June 26, 2012".
The band announced a new label partnership with Josh Grabelle and his label, Bullet Tooth Records, on March 26, 2012. The label will release their next album, "What Doesn't Kill Us," on June 26, 2012.
They will be releasing a B sides EP of songs that did not make the cut for What Dosn't kill us on March 19th called the Vault.
Touring and Album Sales.
As a group, Throw the Fight toured across the United States independently before joining a major tour circuit. Throw the Fight then became a part of the Warped Tour 2007 and performed July 13–22. The band also participated in the Taste of Chaos Tour 2008, namely the St. Paul stop of the tour, which took place on March 4. Throw the Fight toured alongside Drowning Pool in full support of their album "In Pursuit of Tomorrow". The band has toured and shared stages with other national acts such as Avenged Sevenfold, Papa Roach, Buckcherry, Staind, Chevelle, Lost Prophets, A Change of Pace, among many others.
On June 7, 2009, group vocalist James Clark was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Several tour dates were canceled while James was undergoing treatment. He has since made a full recovery. 
Most recently, Throw the Fight toured the Midwest and East Coast with Metal Blade Records artist, Across the Sun from July 23 to August 15, 2010.
They are currently on tour with Bullet for my Valentine on the Outbreak Tour from 9/25 - 11/4 2013
Currently, the band has toured in over 30 states and sold 33,000 albums and digital singles collectively.

Taylor Hayes (The Bold and the Beautiful)

Dr. Taylor Hayes Forrester (née Hamilton; formerly Marone and Jones) is a fictional character from the American CBS Daytime soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful". Portrayed by Hunter Tylo, the character first appeared during the episode dated June 6, 1990. Taylor is a Los Angeles-based psychiatrist, introduced by William J. Bell to be involved in the show's medical and personal storylines, and as a romantic lead who would tackle social issues. Although she is sophisticated and intelligent, Taylor is characterized as unlucky in love. She was called "no-nonsense" during her early years, although Tylo has mentioned Taylor's frequent absentmindedness despite her professionalism.
Initially, Taylor was the doctor of Caroline Forrester, who eventually died from leukemia, shortly after which Ridge fell in love with Taylor, and they were married two years later. Ridge's ex-lover Brooke Logan and Taylor's ex-husband Blake Hayes unsuccessfully tried to break up the relationship. Years later, Taylor is presumed dead in a plane crash. Upon her return, Ridge had reunited with Brooke; a love triangle between the three ensues and Ridge ultimately chooses Taylor. The couple's marriage produces three children; Thomas, Phoebe and Steffy. Tylo was written out of the series; Bradley Bell decided to kill off Taylor. The character is shot dead by Sheila Carter and made her final appearance on Oct 30, 2002.
Following a guest appearance as a ghost, Taylor is revealed to be alive and returns in April 2005. Ridge once again leaves Brooke for Taylor, but the reunion is short-lived. Taylor accidentally kills Darla Forrester, the wife of Ridge's brother Thorne, in a hit-and-run accident. She then becomes involved with Thorne, though the relationship suffers as a result of this. Taylor then romances Nick Marone; they marry and Taylor begins IVF treatment and bears a son named Jack. It is revealed that Brooke donated the eggs. Taylor removes herself from the situation. Taylor later becomes involved with Rick Forrester and Whip Jones III; both relationships end because of her connection with Ridge. In May 2013, Tylo announced that she had left the show, with Taylor's final appearance airing on July 3, 2013. In January 2014, it was confirmed that Tylo was once again returning to the series, for a guest appearance on February 28, 2014.
The supercouple pairing of Ridge and Taylor and the two-decade-long love triangle between Ridge, Brooke and Taylorwhich was recognized by "Soap Opera Digest" as one of the best love triangles of the genrebecame popular with viewers. Taylor's rivalry with Brooke has also been an ongoing staple on the show for the past twenty years. SoapNet calls Taylor the "polar opposite" of Brooke, and Tommy Garret of "Canyon News" called them the queens of cat-fights.
Casting.
William J. Bell introduced the role of psychiatrist Taylor Ashford Hamilton in 1990, three years after the show began. According to Michael Maloney of "Variety", Bell created her "not only as a romantic leading lady but also as a character who could facilitate social issuesand directly partake in a few, too." Initially her maiden name was Ashford; the character was eventually renamed to Taylor Hamilton Hayes. Hunter Tylo was cast as Taylor, and first appeared as the character on Jun 6, 1990. Tylo was fired from "All My Children" after a three-year run, on the grounds of dating a co-star, Michael Tylo. She was also fired from "Days of our Lives" where she had played Marina Toscano from 1988–89. While working on "All My Children", she was credited as Deborah Morehart, before she married Tylo. Sherilyn Wolter briefly replaced Tylo for a small amount of time in 1990.
Tylo almost left the series in 1996. Later that year, she left the show to pursue a primetime role on the Fox television drama series "Melrose Place". Her last air date was in May 1996. However, she was controversially dismissed because she was pregnant. In response, Tylo sued Aaron Spelling the executive producer of "Melrose Place"and Spelling Productions for millions of US dollars. Her role was then taken by Lisa Rinna. Tylo won her case. That July, it was announced that Tylo was to return to "The Bold and the Beautiful". The show's head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell issued the following statement: "I am certain that Hunter's talent and ability will continue to be an asset to the show".
Development.
Characterization.
Taylor is a "psychiatrist whose life has been intertwined with the lives and loves of the Forrester and the Marone families". SoapNet said she is "just looking for love in all the wrong placesand has certainly suffered for it". Like Brooke, she "considers Ridge the love of her life. Unlike Brooke, she's had three kids with the guy." Although she is a psychiatrist, Taylor has been questioned. In 2000, Ridge is being tricked into a relationship with his mentally unstable high school lover Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton). Morgan becomes pregnant with Ridge's child. When asked how Taylor is going to discover the truth about the pregnancy, Tylo stated: "I just wish that Taylor would get a clue, period! I wish that her psychiatric expertise would kick in already. I mean, she's retarded!", saying that the character can be absentminded. In the same interview, Tylo said, "I think got her degree out of a Cracker Jack box or something. Because, you knowI keep saying to the producer and the directors, you know, she is a psychiatrist, don't you think maybe she has a clue?"
Taylor often loses out to Brooke, as Thorne (Ridge's brother) loses out to Ridge. When asked in 2011 where she would like her storyline to go, Tylo said: "I think we should see Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down." Tylo said her favorite scene was a mud fight with Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) in 2009. Taylor appeared on the "Spartanburg Herald-Journal" in an article titled "Stars with 9 Lives: Death Is not forever in Soaps" after her airplane crash in 1994 resulted in her assumed death. Taylor returns later to find out her husband Ridge has married his former flame (Brooke). In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally learning to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, "In psychology, they tell you to be true to yourself. Maybe she is finally doing that, even though in her moral compass she knows that it is better to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much." Tylo also said that Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery) is partly the driving force behind this, stating: "Stephanie has been telling her all along to go for what she wants and to not be otherwise where Brooke’s manipulations are concerned Stephanie’s whole mission was to get Taylor to smell the coffee and realize that not everybody has as altruistic an agenda as she does."
Relationship with Ridge.
Most of Taylor's romantic history is about her relationship with Ridge Forrester (Ron Moss). They met in 1990 when Taylor was treating his dying wife Caroline Spencer (Joanna Johnson), and they fell in love shortly afterwards. However, there were several obstacles to their romance, including Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang)Ridge's former love who was still in love with himand Taylor's ex-husband Blake Hayes (Peter Brown). Blake and Brooke conspire to keep Taylor and Ridge apart. At one point Taylor dumps Ridge, but he proposes to her and they become engaged.
In 1991, John Goudas from "The Gadsden Times" wrote, "Take this summer's love triangle between Ridge, Brooke and Dr. Taylor Hayes. Is Ridge just playing with Taylor, or does he mean it when he tells Brooke that he and Taylor will be married?" Goudas also wrote that Taylor was no-nonsense with Ridge, saying, "newcomer Hunter Tylo, new since June 90' as Is the odd women out in the bunch, bucking a close knit trio. Taylor is a beauty and strong enough to make her own demands on Ridge. There is no doubt she is hooked by Ridge, But Taylor won't marry unless he promises to never leave her for Brooke. That kind of promise is for the birds, but Taylor wants insurance." Goudas said that Tylo was "too beautiful" to play the upfront Taylor who had brains and discipline, which was aimed to be the polar opposite qualities to that of Brooke, the other half of the love triangle. He said: "We Don't see Dr Taylor Hayes do much practicing, or ever making hospital rounds. Air time means time with Ridge or ex Husband Blake".
Despite the inconvenience, Taylor and Ridge marry in 1992. Taylor and Ridge's wedding was ranked 18 on The Huffington Post's "Top 20 Most Memorable Soap Weddings of All Time". Michael Maloney wrote that: "You'd never know it by the characters' faces, but they were under a real-life pressure. 'B&B' shot this episode on the day of the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles". They are popularly referred to by the portmanteau "Tridge" in social media. The love triangle between Brooke, Ridge and Taylor is widely famous and from the early nineties has been considered one of the genre's greatest love triangles to date.
Ridge is believed to be Brooke's daughter Bridget Forrester's father in her first years, but in March 1996 it eventuates that Bridget's biological father is Eric. Taylor's airplane crashes and she is presumed dead; Ridge moves on with Brooke. However, Taylor returns after she is kidnapped by Prince Omar. They divorced in 1995. They have sex and Taylor gave birth to a son, Thomas. However, when she sees him with Brooke, she tells everyone Thorne is Thomas' father. During this time, Brooke supposedly has a miscarriage and knows about Thomas' paternity; scheming to keep it from Ridge. When Ridge discovers he is Thomas' father, he is angry at Taylor and Brooke. He accuses Brooke of faking her pregnancy and miscarriage to keep him, while ignoring Taylor for not telling him about that he has a son. He left Brooke and they reunited, remarrying in 1998. Taylor is presumed dead in 2002, and Ridge returns to Brooke the following year. In 2004, Taylor's ghost visits Ridge and tells him that she is happy that he is with Brooke and they watch their children together. Taylor and Ridge renew their vows in 2005, but thir marriage is annulled a year later. They reunite briefly in 2009 and 2011. Jamey Giddens of "Zap2It" stated that Steffy and Thomas "grew up watching their daddy basically climb out of their mom's bed and right into the sack with Rick (Jacob Young) and Hope's (Kimberly Matula) mom, over and over again."
Tuberculosis.
In July 1999, Taylor is pregnant for the second time. During her pregnancy, Taylor interacts with a man who has tuberculosis and coughs on her. She worries that her babies might be affected by this. She is alarmed to find that the man has died, and has a coughing spell herself. Eventually, Taylor is tested and diagnosed with tuberculosis and she endures a high-risk pregnancy. SoapNet wrote, "Thanks to Taylor’s battle with TB during her pregnancy, tough times started early for Steffy and her twin sister Phoebe." Taylor refuses medication for her condition, wanting to protect her unborn babies. Tylo said, "It was a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women". Taylor's heart stops beating shortly after the twins are born, but she survives.
Departure and return.
In October 2002, head-writer Bradley Bell decided to kill of Taylor, and Tylo was to leave "The Bold and the Beautiful". In a statement on her website, Tylo wrote, "It is with great sadness i have to tell you that Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word played out." Her last appearance was on Oct 30, 2002. In March 2004, Tylo made a guest appearance as Taylor's ghost to meet up with her husband Ridge, Brooke and others. In 2005, Deanna Barnert of "Soap Opera Digest" wrote that an industry insider had said that a character "may come back from the world beyond", and fans speculated that either Macy or Taylor would return. Tylo was said to be "having fun surprising her castmates" with her reappearance on set.
Other relationships.
Taylor has been involved with Ridge's half-brother Thorne (Winsor Harmon). Their affair begins in 1998 when she nearly tried to lie that Thomas was Thorne's son, and she would raise him with Thorne. They become involved in 2006, however Taylor hides from Thorne that she accidentally killed his wife Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison). Taylor is exonerated when an eyewitness account proves that Darla's death was an accident. Thorne ends the relationship because his daughter Alexandria Forrester (Harley Graham) begins to resent Taylor. Of working with Tylo, Harmon said, "I am so comfortable with Hunter. We have that around each other, and when that happens as an artist, you are allowed to open up more and there is more spontaneity."
After her relationship with Ridge ends, Taylor befriends and marries Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) in 2007. Their relationship is ruined because Brooke is the biological mother of their child, Jack Marone, through egg donation. Following this, she becomes involved with Brooke's son Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder), who is many years younger than her. The relationship infuriates Brooke, who is concerned about Rick's heart being broken, and Ridge's jealousy. Taylor and Rick eventually get engaged. During an interview with Michael Fairman of "On-Air On-Soaps", Tylo said, "You could be 30 and dating 20-year-olds, as long as you are over 18, that’s what is important. When I got my divorce, my husband, Michael Tylo, was 15 years older than me". Tylo said she enjoyed working with Lowder on the storyline, saying, "Kyle is adorable! I drew on those same feelings that unexpectedly happen when I was running lines with my acting friend, and it was very cool, because I do see that in Kyle, too."
Taylor becomes involved with Whipple Jones III (Rick Hearst) whom she meets through internet dating, in July 2009. Tommy Garret of "Canyon News" said that Whipple and Taylor's "chemistry is magnificent". Whipple was previously involved with Brooke; Garret wrote: "Now he's in love with Brooke's mortal enemy Taylor Hayes Forrester Hearst is magnificently suited for the role and fans want to see Whip and Taylor find happiness. At least for a few months." Of their romance, Tylo said: "I think Taylor has found true love with Whip. I think if she was a smart psychiatrist, and able to apply her knowledge in her own world, she would be with Whip. She would know this is a healthy relationship. But Taylor doesn’t see it. She still wants to fix people." Taylor and Whipple marry on Apr 1, 2010. Whip becomes jealous when Taylor admits to Stephanie that she still has feelings for Ridge. Whipple's increasing jealousy of Taylor's feelings for Ridge leads to the demise of their relationship the following year, and they divorce. During their short run, fans referred to the couple as "Tip".
In 2011, Taylor reunites with Thorne and they team up against the Forresters for mistreating them. Tylo said: "probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to have a shot at Forrester in the driver’s seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge." However, Tylo said there was a "sticky point" between them because Taylor killed Darla. Speaking of this, Tylo said: "Taylor has a little guilt, but she would do anything to make up for that Thorne was even there with her when he helped get her to AA. Thorne was really forgiving and loving. So she knows that Thorne has a really good heart, and that he has been pushed to the wayside and neglected. I want to believe that Taylor, as a psychiatrist, would understand how sad of a life that it is ... that this young man who always grew up in the shadow of Ridge, is always getting the seconds, and how that must feel for him." Harmon said that Thorne forgives Taylor because he has forgiven people his whole life. Taylor and Thorne kiss at the Forrester Creations Fashion House, while Ridgewho is shockedis present. Of this, Harmon said, "At that moment, [Ridge just did this look and said this line that was hilarious. I seriously almost started laughing when I was in the middle of the scene." Michael Fairman called them "the screwed-over couple of B&B".
Rivalry with Brooke.
Taylor and Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) have been enemies since 1990, having "fought over the affections of fickle fashion designer Ridge Forrester" according to Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential.
The rivalry between Brooke and Taylor has not concluded. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through IVF, having been implanted with a donor's egg, which because of a mistake Bridget makes in the lab, Brooke donated. Thus, Brooke is Jack Marone's biological mother. Brooke saves the baby's life when he needs a bone marrow transplant. After this, Taylor fears her baby will be drawn to Brooke while growing up. Taylor finds bonding with her baby difficult and began drinking again. Taylor's instability leads to her losing custody of Jack. Michael Fairman said that her loss of custody occurred around the time which Tylo had lost a son in real life. Tylo said: "I did get a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, “Was I okay with those scenes and after them?” They would say, “You know it’s so weird, that the storyline is mirroring Hunter Tylo’s life!" In the same interview, Tylo said that she tapped into her own tragedy for her portrayal. She said: "Well, because of the acting technique I use when I did those scenes, I had to go back and allow my self to feel what I feel all the time. It’s the feeling that will never go away which is, 'It’s not fair,' and that line I added. Once I added it and we did the rehearsal, I thought, 'I am going to say this, because that is how I feel!' After that, it just kept coming out."
The feud over Jack intensifies Taylor and Brooke's decade-long rivalry. Darren Lomas of Daytime Confidential said, "As any fan of The Bold and the Beautiful knows, the Taylor and Brooke wars have lasted for nearly two decades. Even when Taylor was taking thought to be dead, fan message boards still buzzed with Taylor and Brooke fans taking swipes at each other". "Zap2It" ran a poll with four options: "Taylor ends up with Rick", "Taylor ends up with Ridge and Nick ends up with Brooke" among others. The option of Brooke and Nick raising Jack together while Taylor reunites with Ridge was the most popular, with forty-eight per cent of reader's votes. In 2010, Lang and Tylo recreated the 1983 lily-pond cat-fight between Krystle Carrington and Alexis Colby in "Dynasty", shooting the scenes in the CBS Studio TV City koi carp pond. Tommy Garret called them the queens of soap opera cat-fights. Unlike the original 1983 "Dynasty" cat-fight, Tylo and Lang acted the scenes themselves.
Departure.
On May 15, 2013, Tylo announced on social media that she was exiting "The Bold and the Beautiful", possibly for good. Following this, the actress stated in a post on her website, "For me, contract talks ended 4 weeks ago. I am moving forward and opening back up to the thousands of acting roles available, writing, and persuing my skin care line. My friends and B&B fans will be sorely missed." Tylo's final appearance aired on her birthday: July 3, 2013. Dan J. Kroll of the website Soap Central was shocked by her exit, though felt that a future return was possible, judging from her previous departures. The news of Tylo's third exit came just months after the high-profile departures of Ronn Moss as Ridge and Susan Flannery as Stephanie.
In January 2014, it was confirmed that Tylo was once again returning to the series, for a one-episode appearance, airing on February 28, 2014.
Storylines.

Taylor and Eric encounter problems in their blissful relationship over his keeping Brooke's secret. Taylor defines the difference between her and Brooke and walks out.
Reception.
Tommy Garret of "Canyon News" said Taylor is the "epitome of grace and dignity". In another article, Garret praised Tylo's versatile performance. Garret also said that half of the show's fans have supported Taylor in the love triangle since her debut on the series, stating, "Brooke and Ridge have a rich and sensual back story that helped build the famed B&B history. But Taylor also is a confident woman who knows that she’s best for Ridge and so does at least half of the show’s fans." John Goudas of "The Gadsden Times" praised the Taylor for her no-nonsense attitude towards Ridge, and wrote that she had beauty as well as brains.
A writer from SoapNet said she the opposite of Brooke and wrote, "Taylor is less likely to use sex for selfish purposes." Debashine Thangevelo of Independent Online (South Africa) said, "Tylo is an actress who wields as much influence in the world of soaps as Taylor Hayes in SABC1’s The Bold and the Beautiful. Having inhabited this role for almost two decades, barring a sabbatical, she has made an indelible impression on viewers." Thangevelo wrote that Taylor's daughter Steffy Forrester is a "very much younger version" of Taylor's enemy, Brooke. Tylo said of the character's evolution, "Well, I don’t think she has been throwing caution to the wind. She has been saying, ‘Whenever I am self-sacrificing, I end up getting screwed over and hurt in the end.’ And now she is trying a different approach. Or rather she is protecting herself." Mark Larkin of the "Daily Mail" described the Ridge-Brooke-Taylor love triangle as "epic", having stretched across decades.
For her portrayal of Taylor, Hunter Tylo was nominated for "Favorite Hottest Female Star" at the 1995 Soap Opera Digest Awards, however Kristina Wagner of "General Hospital" won. Tylo was nominated for the same award at the 1999 Soap Opera Digest Awards ("Days Of Our Lives" star Kristian Alfonso won that year). Tylo won a Telvis Award Foreign Female TV Performer (Finnish: Ulkomainen naisesiintyjä) for her work on the show in 2002.

Joseph Glover

Joseph "Joe" Glover is an American professor and currently serves as the Provost for the University of Florida.
Glover attended Cornell University for his Bachelors degree, and he received his Masters and Doctorate in Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego. Glover began his academic career at University of California, Berkeley, and he would go on to serve as an Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester from 1979-1982.
Career.
University of Florida.
In 1982, Glover joined the faculty at the University of Florida. In 1987 he was promoted to full Professor, and served as Chairman of the Department of Mathematics from 1993-1998. Glover then served as the Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In 2001, he was named Associate Provost for Academic Affairs, and then was promoted in interim dean of College of Liberal Arts and Science in 2006, and he served in this capacity for the 2007-2008 academic year. Then in July 2008, Dr. Joseph Glover was appointed Provost of the University of Florida. 
In September 2010, Glover pitched an idea to the Florida Board of Governors to give incoming UF students the option of taking classes during the spring and summer terms only, bypassing the fall semester, to ease the strain on its crowded facilities. He described it as a "productive, efficient way to admit more students to a university for which there is high-demand".
Block Tuition.
Glover is the leading proponent of an effort by the University of Florida to institute block tuition, in replacement of having students pay by credit hour. Under one proposal, students would be charged a flat-rate fee analogous to 15 credits for full-time undergraduate students regardless if they take 12, 15 or 18 credits. Charging market-rate tuition for distance-education graduate students is also a part of the plan. Glover believes block tuition is the "way it should be," believing it would financially benefit students taking a heavy load of classes, cost slightly more for those taking fewer classes, could help increase UF’s graduation rate, and open up spots for students who might otherwise be turned away under enrollment limits. Glover made a statement saying "a student who spends more time here is taking up a spot that a student waiting in the wings is waiting to have." Glover estimates that the switch will generate a “small” revenue boost of about $4 million of extra recurring revenue, which would be reinvested in the form of adding sections to classes and hiring faculty to accommodate more students.

<doc id="18239692" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18239692" title="Maximianus (poet)">
Maximianus (poet)

Maximianus or Maximian (sometimes referred to as Maximianus Etruscus) was a Latin elegiac poet of the 6th century, who has been called "in some sort, the last of the Roman poets".
Life.
Nothing is known of Maximianus's life save what can be inferred from his poetry. In it, he claims Etruscan descent ("me … Etruscae gentis alumnum" describes his youth and manhood, including his friendship with Boethius, whom he apostrophizes as "greatest investigator of the greatest matters" ("magnarum scrutator maxime rerum" [3.47); and says that, already aged, he was sent as an ambassador to the emperor's court at Constantinople (5.1–4). Some scholars, however, have maintained that the poetry represents the utterances of one or more personas and that nothing therein, including the name Maximianus, is to be taken as reliable information about the poet.
Poetry.
Maximianus's poetry, usually divided into six separate elegies, deals with the contrast between the infirmities of age and the vigor and amours of youth. The first, and longest, elegy presents in detail the miseries of the "prison", the "living death", that is old age. The second tells of the poet's long love for Lycoris, who abandoned him as he began to grow old; the third and fourth, of his youthful passions for Aquilina and Candida. The fifth recounts his abortive tryst with a Greek girl during his embassy in the East, along with her reaction to his impotence; and the sixth, consisting of only twelve lines, again expresses the horror of approaching death. Throughout, "the imminence of death and the sadness of growing old are seen as representing the end of pagan culture and its joy in living".
Reception.
Despite its erotic content, Maximianus's verse was part of the corpus of texts used in the 11th and 12th centuries to teach schoolboys the rudiments of Latin, though its use for this purpose was criticized by Alexander of Villedieu:
quamvis haec non sit doctrina satis generalis,<br>
proderit ipsa tamen plus nugis Maximiani.
(Although this is, Alexander's instruction is not wholly sufficient,<br>
it is more profitable than the trifles of Maximianus.)
Perhaps because of this use of the poetry in elementary education, echoes of and references to it are found in a wide variety of medieval writers. A Middle English poem entitled "Le Regret de Maximian" was based on Maximianus's first elegy, and Chaucer's use of the Latin poet's work has been investigated by a number of scholars.
Although one or more printed editions of the work had appeared in the 15th century, it was the 1501 edition by the Neapolitan teenager Pomponius Gauricus that attracted the most attention among Renaissance scholars. Gauricus, suppressing the distich in which the name Maximianus appears and altering the reference to Boethius, published the verse as the work of the first-century-BC poet Cornelius Gallus, whose elegies were thought to be entirely lost. This enthusiastic error (or deliberate fraud) caused Maximianus's poetry to be widely misattributed to Gallus for hundreds of years. Gauricus also appears responsible for the division of the verse, which in almost all the manuscripts appears as a continuous poem, into six elegies—a division that has been followed by subsequent editors.
The first published English translation, by Hovenden Walker, was titled "The Impotent Lover: Accurately Described in Six Elegies upon Old Age, with the Old Doting Letcher's Resentments on the Past Pleasures and Vigorous Performances of Youth".

Doering debuted for All Japan Pro Wrestling on June 24, 2007. After finishing the studying abroad period, All Japan rewarded Joe Doering with a gaijin contract in September 2007, and Doering became a member of the main roster. His first feud would be with Suwama, whom he pinned on October 18, 2007. Suwama swore revenge on Doering, but was once again pinned by him in the opening match of the 2007 World's Strongest Tag Determination League, where Doering teamed with Japanese legend Keiji Mutoh and Suwama with Satoshi Kojima. The teams would meet again in the finals of the same tournament and this time Mutoh pinned Suwama to win the tournament. On January 3, 2008, Doering and Mutoh defeated Kojima and TARU to win the AJPW Unified World Tag Team Championship. However, due to Mutoh's busy schedule the team did not make any defenses, before losing the titles on June 28 to GURENTAI's Taiyō Kea and Minoru Suzuki.
Doering's next feud would be with Zodiac, whom he defeated on May 25, 2008, in a Hair vs. mask match.

Doering regained the title from Manabu Soya and Takao Ōmori on May 20, 2012, this time teaming with Seiya Sanada. Doering and Sanada lost the title back to Soya and Ōmori on June 17. Doering then reunited with the returning Zodiac, however, after the two failed to regain the AJPW Unified World Tag Team Championship from Soya and Ōmori on September 8, Doering ended the short-lived partnership by turning on Zodiac. On November 13, Suwama announced that he and Doering had decided to form a new partnership named "Last Revolution". Later in the month, Last Revolution made it to the finals of the 2012 World's Strongest Tag Determination League, before losing to the team of Manabu Soya and Takao Ōmori. In early 2013, Last Revolution was joined by Kaz Hayashi, Shuji Kondo and Yasufumi Nakanoueno. However, when Hayashi and Kondo announced in June 2013 that they were resigning from All Japan, Doering announced that Last Revolution could no longer continue and would be disbanding following June 30. However, after defeating Suwama, the reigning Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title singles match on September 15, Doering and he decided to come back together and go for the Unified World Tag Team Championship, renaming their team "Evolution". On October 22, Evolution defeated Burning (Go Shiozaki and Jun Akiyama) to win the AJPW Unified World Tag Team Championship. As a result of pinning Akebono in a tag team match, Doering earned himself a shot at his Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated in the title match on November 24. On December 8, Evolution defeated Xceed (Go Shiozaki and Kento Miyahara) in the finals to win the 2013 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. On February 16, 2014, Hikaru Sato joined Doering and Suwama, turning Evolution into a stable.

<doc id="18239945" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18239945" title="Lachin Kurdish Republic">
Lachin Kurdish Republic

The Lachin Kurdish Republic was self-proclaimed on 20 May, 1992, in Lachin, just two days after this area of Azerbaijan had been captured and burned by Armenian forces and largely emptied of its population as part of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh War. The idea, essentially a nominal re-institution of the 1920s entity of Red Kurdistan, was floated by the Armenians for whom the Lachin corridor constituted a strategically vital link to Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the area's small Kurdish population had already fled along with the ethnic Azeris - most finding refuge in other regions of Azerbaijan. Thus the Kurdish youths and intellectuals (around seventy people in total) who set up the Republic were specially transported to Lachin from Armenia in buses provided by Yerevan's municipal government. The scene was described as looking more like a wedding celebration than the proclamation a state.
Beyond the republic's declaration by these two busloads of visitors, no real state emerged and rather than populating the area with Kurds, Lachin was partly repopulated over time with Armenians.
Ministers.
The republic's Prime Minister, Wekîl Mustafayev had, according to press releases, "worked as a senior KGB officer in Central Asia during the days of the Soviet Union. He had been born into a family that had been exiled to Uzbekistan. His wife was serving as an officer in the Soviet military." Sheref e Eshir was declared Deputy Prime Minister, while other cabinet positions included Karlan e Chachani as declared Minister of Culture and Emerike Serdar as Minister of Information. Five years later Serdar was quoted as saying "We all knew full well that the Armenians were never going to give us that land, and that we were never going to be able to convince the Kurds to come and settle in the land depopulated because of the war. But we went to Lachin to leave a marker for history."
After the failure of the Republic, Wekîl Mustafayev moved to Krasnodar and later took refuge in Italy.

James Boyer

The Reverend James Boyer (1736–1814) was the tyrannical headmaster of Christ’s Hospital from the years 1778 to 1799.
These turbulent years at the end of the 18th century were when three of the school's most famous students attended: Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Boyer’s personality was immortalized in the writing of all three authors. Hunt made several references to Boyer in his autobiography, Lamb wrote of him in his two famous essays concerning his time at Christ’s Hospital, and Coleridge referred to him his Biographia Literaria. 
Through the work of these three authors in particular Boyer became infamous for his capricious and unpredictable brutality reminiscent of the dreaded Wackford Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby. Most famously, Boyer knocked one of Hunt’s teeth out by throwing a heavy copy of Homer at his head from across the room. 
Lamb wrote this about the arbitrary violence of Boyer:
The arbitrary nature of Boyer’ tyranny is illustrated in a story Hunt tells of a boy referred to simply as C__ with whom the master took “every opportunity to be severe with him, nobody knew why. 
Despite his tyrannical influence at Christ’s Hospital, Boyer is often credited with much of the achievement of the students at the school during this time there. Coleridge, in particular, praised Boyer’s influence concerning his approach to poetics. 
According to Hunt, when Coleridge learned that Boyer was on his death-bed, he said “it was lucky that the cherubim who took him to heaven were nothing but faces and wings, or he would infallibly have flogged them by the way.”

<doc id="18240140" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18240140" title="Herero Day">
Herero Day

Herero Day (also known as Red Flag Day and Red Flag Heroes' Day, ) is a gathering of the Herero people of Namibia to commemorate their deceased chieftains. It is held in Okahandja in central Namibia annually on August 26, the day and place Herero chief Samuel Maharero's body was reburied alongside his ancestors in 1923. Accordingly, the celebrations last three days long, although they usually begin on the Sunday nearest the 23rd.
Background.
The Battle of Waterberg on 11 August 1904 was the final battle of the Herero Wars. Following the defeat of the Herero force, the surviving Hereros fled into the Kalahari Desert under the leadership of Samuel Maharero. Of the estimated 4-6,000 Herero warriors, only 1,175 reached their destination of British Bechuanaland, the rest died of thirst, hunger, and diseases.
Samuel Maharero gained British asylum at the Bechuanaland Protectorate and lived in exile at Tsau until 1907, and later in the Transvaal. Only after he died on 14 March 1923 was his body relocated to South-West Africa. His remains arrived at Okahandja on 23 August 1923, and on 26 August he was reburied there. 
Unaware of the role the reburial would play as a commemoration of anti-colonialisation and a symbol of nationalism, the South African administration granted permission for the reburial. The respective ceremony was attended by 3,000 Hereros and by 100 Whites, including high-ranking government officials. Since then, Herero Day is held annually as a gesture of resistance, unity and loyalty, as well as defiance against colonisation, particularly that by the Germans.
Proceedings.
The main event of the 3-day gathering is a procession to several graves of Herero chiefs, followed by a church service. The men wear military-style phantasy uniforms, the women wear the traditional dress of the Herero, a voluminous skirt of many layers with a "horned hat", headgear consisting of two wide points.
Heroes' Day.
On August 26 Namibia also celebrates Heroes' Day, a national holiday commemorating the Namibian War of Independence which began on 26 August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe. SWAPO and its People's Liberation Army deliberately chose the date of the first armed struggle to fall on the anniversary of Samuel Maharero's reburial, a symbol of nationalism and strength.

Heroes' Day (Namibia)

Heroes' Day is a national public holiday in Namibia. It is recognized by the United Nations as Namibia Day. Celebrated annually on 26 August, the day commemorates the Namibian War of Independence which began on 26 August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe.
Origin.
The Battle of Waterberg on 11 August 1904 was the final battle of the Herero Wars. Following the defeat of the Herero force, the surviving Hereros fled under the leadership of Samuel Maharero, who died in exile in the Transvaal. After his death on 14 March 1923, the South African administration of South-West Africa granted permission for his reburial at Okahandja, unaware of the role it would play as a commemoration of anti-colonialisation and a symbol of nationalism.
The reburial ceremony on 26 August 1923 was attended by 3,000 Hereros and by 100 Whites, including high-ranking government officials. Since then, Herero Day is held annually as a gesture of resistance, unity and loyalty, as well as defiance against colonisation, particularly that by the Germans. SWAPO and its military wing during the Namibian War of Independence, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), deliberately chose the date of the first armed struggle to fall on the anniversary of Samuel Maharero's reburial, a symbol of nationalism and strength.
On 26 August 1966, eight helicopters of the South African Defence Force attacked the guerrilla fighters at Omugulugwombashe. At the time of attack there were only 17 soldiers in the camp. It was the first armed battle of the War.
Proceedings.
National celebrations take place annually at different places, usually in the north of Namibia near important battle zones. Hundreds of people annually gather to watch leaders such as Hifikepunye Pohamba, Sam Nujoma and Nahas Angula officially commemorate veterans of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Likewise, honours, such as military medals, are handed out on the day. Heroes' Acre, a war memorial outside of Windhoek, was opened on Heroes' Day in 2002. It is also the same day that the United Nations Institute for Namibia, a tertiary educational body in Zambia under the auspices of the United Nations and forerunner to the University of Namibia, was inaugurated in 1976.

Jon Roberts

Jon Pernell Roberts (June 21, 1948 – December 28, 2011), born John Riccobono, was a noted drug trafficker and government informant who, after leaving New York City where he associated with the Gambino crime family, operated in the Miami area and was an associate of Colombia's Medellín Cartel during the growth phase in cocaine trafficking, 1975–1985. After his arrest, he was able to avoid a lengthy prison sentence by becoming a cooperating witness and proactive informant for the federal government. He is the coauthor with Evan Wright of "American Desperado".
Early life.
Roberts was born in New York City to Sicilian American parents. His father Nat Riccobono had earlier moved with his brothers from Sicily and made a living through involvement with various shady businesses throughout New York in the late 1940s. After being apprehended by police for kidnapping, Roberts was given an opportunity to expunge his record with military service. Roberts claims to have served with the 101st Airborne for four years in Vietnam. He received injuries during the war that required a metal plate to be attached to his skull. After working for members of the New York Mafia as a club manager and restaurateur, he moved to Miami to distance himself from business partners he believed were targeted by rival criminals. However, in his book "American Desperado," he claims he moved to Miami because both the mafia and law enforcement were after him because he was suspected in the murder of a police officer.
Introduction to cartel.
As demand for cocaine increased, Roberts found his Cuban suppliers unable to meet his demand. Through Roberts' girlfriend, he met Mickey Munday. Munday was a trafficker who introduced Roberts to Medellín agent Rafael "Rafa" Cardona Salazar. At first, Munday was apprehensive of Roberts, who had driven up in a black Mercedes Benz, which Munday described as having "drug dealer written all over it". He also stated that Roberts' flashy car and flamboyant lifestyle made Roberts look like "someone I wanted nothing to do with".
Nevertheless, Roberts and Munday began working under the supervision of Max Mermelstein, who had an agreement with Salazar to manage the transportation of cocaine from Colombia to Miami. He then oversaw the delivery of the loads to cartel safehouses in the Miami area. Roberts was able to increase his monthly cocaine business through this direct connection. Mermelstein and Munday established the routes for trips to Colombia, using boats, tow truck companies, safehouses, and airstrips, thereby setting up an effective transportation route for the cartel. Roberts claims to have made over $100 million USD dealing cocaine during this period. He spent $50 million of that money on his extravagant lifestyle.
Horses.
In "American Desperado", Roberts describes: "After I made my first big score selling coke to Bernie Levine in California, Danny Mones told me racehorses were a good way to launder money." He and Danny Mones "started Mephisto Stables in 1977".
In Chapter 62 of the book, Roberts recounts a variety of processes by which he used horses to launder money. Additionally, " also learned how to fix races. There were many tricks."
Also in chapter 62, Roberts describes another benefit to horses: "Dealing cocaine had promoted me into high society. Owning racehorses took me into the stratosphere." He recounts prominent people he met through his racehorse connections, such as "Judge Joe Johnson, who hosted horse auctions", and through him, "We got friendly with Cliff Perlman, who owned Caesar's Palace. When I'd go to Caesar's and get comped, everybody assumed it was because of my Mafia connections. No, I was connected to Caesar's Palace by a Kenucky judge." Through the same circle, "We ended up becoming friends with Al Tannenbaum and his girlfriend, Gloria. Al was a guy who'd made it big in stereos."
He describes a particular horse in the epigraph to his book: 
Roberts also describes an honest jockey he had hired, and that jockey's demise:
Multiple news outlet reports support Jon's recollection, except they fix the date one year later. As they document: on December 28, 1978, jockey Niconar "Nick" Navarro was killed by a direct lightning strike after completing the second race at Calder Race Course. The remaining eight races at the track that day were cancelled.
Downfall.
Mermelstein acted as high-level trafficker working under cartel member Salazar and with the Munday transportation group. He was apprehended in 1985 by Miami Police as a multi-kilo dealer. Mermelstein was implicated by a California trafficker who gave information to the DEA in return for a lighter sentence; this trafficker was busted along with John DeLorean during a 25-kilo cocaine sting. Mermelstein then turned state's witness against the Medellín Cartel and supplied information that lead to the dismemberment of Medellín in Miami. On the morning of September 20, 1986, a little over a year after Mermelstein's arrest, the DEA (in conjunction with local and federal authorities) raided sites across Florida used to store and transport cocaine by Munday and Roberts. Roberts was arrested and then went on the run, becoming a fugitive living in Colombia and other parts of the world. He was later apprehended and became a cooperating witness and proactive informant for the federal government.
Later years and death.
According to his ex-wife and various other sources, Roberts used his past to gain trust within the criminal community and report their activities to the authorities in order to maintain his prison-free status. Others have also accused Roberts of being a confidential informant; one of the Fort Lauderdale police officers who arrested him in 1997 for stalking an ex-girlfriend, possession of a firearm, and resisting arrest with violence testified he "found out later he's been a snitch or something. He was a CI informant for somebody."
In a 2009 "Miami New Times" article, Roberts' lifestyle when he lived in Hollywood, Florida was described as follows:
In 2011, Garcia-Roberts interviewed Roberts' "American Desperado" co-author Evan Wright for a "Miami New Times" article (coincidentally dated one month before Roberts' death). In the article, titled ""American Desperado": Co-Author Evan Wright on Coke Cowboy Jon Roberts' Memoir", the two authors discuss the book as well as their impressions and experiences when interviewing Roberts. For example, they share that Roberts was not completely reformed in his later days:
Roberts died of cancer on 28 December 2011, aged 63.

Operation Jayasikurui

Operation Jayasikurui ("Certain Victory" in Sinhala), was a Sri Lankan military action launched on 13 May 1997; it lasted until it was called off in 1999. The primary objective of this operation was to clear a land route to the government-held Jaffna peninsula (which had no land supply routes) through territory held by the LTTE (or Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers), by linking the government-held towns of Vavuniya and Kilinochchi. At the time it was the largest military operation undertaken by the Sri Lankan military. 
Background.
Following Operation Riviresa in 1995, the Sri Lankan military gained control over the Jaffna peninsula. The LTTE withdrew to the jungles of the Wanni from where in 1996 they launched an attack on an isolated Sri Lanka Army (SLA) garrison in Mullaitivu. After the Battle of Mullaitivu the LTTE gained control over the Mullaitivu district, since the government did not reestablish a base due to the lack of a land supply route to it. Instead, at the request of the deputy minister of defence, General Anurudha Ratwatte, the military forces began to plan a large scale operation to open a land route to Jaffna. 
The battle.
The operation launched on 13 May 1997, with the 53rd division spearheading the offensive along with the 21st, 54th, 55th and 56th Divisions. It was preceded by a massive artillery and aerial bombardment with the SLA breaking out of their fortifications at Vavuniya and Manal Aru and pushing into the LTTE-controlled Vanni.
The stated objective of the operation was to capture the A9 highway, running from Vavuniya to the Jaffna peninsula, thereby allowing the establishment of a main supply route (MSR) to the SLA's isolated Jaffna garrison. It was also meant to engage and draw the LTTE out of its secure jungle bases. The Tigers could then be crippled, if not destroyed, by the SLA's superior firepower. The SLA wanted to diminish the strength of the LTTE by the end of the year so that they had to fight only a low-intensity guerrilla war.
The operation was very ambitious from the start, requiring large numbers of troops for both offensive operations and for the defense of the captured territory. As a result, units of the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Air Force were deployed for ground operations in support of the SLA. 
The operation nevertheless did not manage to accomplish even half of its objectives. By mid-May 1998, the operation had completely stalled. The critical A9 (between Mankulam and Kilinochchi) highway remained firmly in LTTE hands. It was planned that the highway would fall swiftly, but it did not. The battle for the A9 was bloody, the LTTE admitted to losing some 1,300 fighters in the defence of the road.
At the beginning of the operation the Tigers used, for the first time in the war, artillery captured from the SLA during the Battle of Mullaitivu. They hit the advancing military columns. When the SLA captured the three initial objectives of Mannakulam, Omanthai and Nedunkerni towns, the operation was already behind schedule. As the two columns from Omanthai and Nedunkerni moved towards Puliyankulam in a pincer movement, the LTTE launched its first major counter-attack. LTTE commandos penetrated deep behind SLA lines to smash a major staging area, destroying vast quantities of supplies and killing dozens of troops. Puliyankulam was meant to be the linking up point for the twin prongs of the SLA assault. However, the LTTE had built very effective defenses at the village and after three months of heavy fighting the SLA had to withdraw after sufferng hundreds of casualties and sustaining dozens of tanks destroyed. The defenders of Puliyankulam had irrevocably delayed the SLA's advance and the operation could no longer be completed on time.
The LTTE also staged a number of counter-attacks against SLA positions throughout the campaign. One such was during June 1997, when the Tigers launched attacks on the SLA-held towns of Thandikulam and Omanthai. A pro-LTTE website claimed that the attacks left 700 SLA soldiers dead and some 1,500 wounded in contrast to only 165 dead rebels.
In addition, the SLA garrison at Mannakulam was also attacked on 4 December 1997. 146 SLA soldiers were killed in the fighting along with an unknown number of LTTE.
Aftermath.
Operation Jayasikurui ended after 19 months in 1999 when it was called off by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The operation had failed to achieve its objective of gaining a land route to Jaffna, but had acquired the towns of Mannakulam, Omanthai and Nedunkerni. However, in the process several areas, including the town of Kilinochchi, were lost to the LTTE who also claimed to have captured a 122mm artillery piece (taking its total to five), 81mm and 60mm mortars, machine guns, RPG launchers and assault rifles.
The human cost of the operation was high, with both sides sustaining heavy casualties. The government admitted to losing around 1,350 soldiers since the start of the operation, although some independent western analysts thought that the figure could be as many as 3,000. The SLA claimed to have killed 3,614 LTTE cadres and wounded 1,899 during the operation.

A Month of Hungry Ghosts

A Month of Hungry Ghosts is a 2008 film about the seventh-lunar-month Hungry Ghost Festival in Singapore. "A Month of Hungry Ghosts" is directed by Singapore-based American film director Tony Kern and co-produced by Genevieve Woo, a Singaporean television news anchor and producer with Channel NewsAsia, and Tony Kern. The film was released locally in Singapore on 7 August 2008. The film is distributed by Golden Village Pictures, and premiered at Golden Village VivoCity, Golden Village Plaza and Sinema Old School.
Plot.
In parts of Asia each year, during the seventh lunar month, it is believed that the gates of Hell are opened and all the souls are set free to wander the Earth. At this time, many spirits roam around trying to fulfill their past needs, wants and desires. These are the "hungry ghosts". Numerous religious rituals and folk performances, like street operas, take place during the seventh lunar month to try to appease the spirits.
This film captures the seventh-lunar-month rituals in Singapore, a world-class centre of business and culture inhabited by many different immigrants from other Asian countries. While the hungry-ghost rituals originated in China and are still practised throughout South-east Asia in various forms, they are slowly dying out in many countries or may only be performed for several days of the month.
Singapore is unique in that the rituals are brought to life throughout the entire seventh lunar month. At the same time, the immigrants in Singapore have brought their own native rituals to the small island nation where the hungry-ghost month still thrives. "A Month of Hungry Ghosts" captures these rituals and performances throughout an entire seventh lunar month in Singapore.
Production.
Work on the film began in August 2005.
Music.
Taiwan-based artist MoShang blends recorded sound samples from the streets of Asia with downtempo electronica for a unique sound.
Blog Aloud - Meet the Director and Producer.
On 1 August 2008, the first day of the Hungry Ghost Festival, director Tony Kern and producer Genevieve Woo held a 15-minute interactive session on the film at Cinema Europa, Golden Village VivoCity, right after the screening. They shared about what went behind the making of the documentary and the strange happenings that they encountered.

Susana Machado Bernard House and Barn is an elaborate Art Nouveau Gothic Revival style mansion and carriage house located in the Pico Union section of Los Angeles, California. Built in 1901, the house was designed by noted architect John B. Parkinson (1861–1935). Parkinson also designed the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Union Station and Los Angeles City Hall. Noted for its Gothic style with soaring spaces, the house has vaulted ceilings and curved walls. In 1979, it was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #208), and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The property was purchased in 1996 by the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law. Since 2002, the house has been operated as the Casa Libre/Freedom House, a fourteen-bed shelter for homeless minors. In May 2003, the "Los Angeles Times" profiled the shelter, noting the following: "Casa Libre/Freedom House occupies a newly renovated mansion near MacArthur Park. Registered as a state, county and federal historic site, the home's gothic facade rises elegantly from the corner of South Lake Street and James M. Wood Boulevard. The shelter arranges for schooling, counseling, and medical care for undocumented and unaccompanied immigrant children, mainly from Latin America.

Tussock grasslands of New Zealand

Tussock grasslands form expansive and distinctive landscapes in the South Island and to a lesser extent in the central plateau region of the North Island of New Zealand. Most of the plants referred to as tussocks are in the "Carex", "Chionochloa", "Festuca" and "Poa" genus. 
What would be termed "herbfields" for European mountains, and bunchgrass meadows in North America, are referred to as tussock herbfields in New Zealand due to a dominance of this type of plant. Species of the "Chionochloa" genus dominate in these areas. The larger tussocks are called snow grass (or less commonly as snow tussocks) and may grow up to 2 metres in height. They grow slowly and some specimens are estimated to be several centuries old.

Good Girl Gone Bad Tour

The Good Girl Gone Bad Tour was the second overall and first world concert tour by Barbadian singer Rihanna, in support of her third studio album "Good Girl Gone Bad". The setlist was composed of songs mostly from "Good Girl Gone Bad" but also included some songs from her first two albums. Akon was selected as the opening act for the Canadian dates of the North American leg, while Ciara and David Jordan supported the UK dates of the European leg. Chris Brown joined the tour during the Oceanian leg. 
The show featured Rihanna wearing revealing leather costumes during each show. Many changes were made to the set list throughout the tour. The original set list features a cover of Bob Marley's "Is This Love" and during the European leg of the tour, the set list was shortened to fifteen songs. In the third set list of the Oceanian and Asian leg, the show ended with an encore. A DVD of the Manchester concert at the Manchester Arena titled "Good Girl Gone Bad Live" was released on June 17, 2008.
Background and development.
The tour, directed and choreographed by Tina Landon, was the first tour headlined by Rihanna. It presented a whole new image as she wore very provocative and revealing leather costumes during each show. The stage was elaborate, consisting of a large set of stairs; two large LCD screens which showed images of Rihanna and special-made clips during the concert; and six slim LCD screens which were evenly spaced out, with three on the left and three on the right. The stage also consisted of thousands of lights which flashed in different colors, there was also a huge LCD screen in the middle of the stage which was mainly focused on Rihanna performing. The stage was packed with pyrotechnics and different on-stage props which Rihanna and the dancers used during their performances. Her back-up singers and band were on either side on the stage. During the Australia leg of the tour the stage also featured a small rising platform at the front center of the stage. For "Disturbia" she started high in the air on the platform, and rose on it again during "Unfaithful". 
Akon was selected as the opening act for the tour in Canada during North America leg. The rest of the shows during the North American leg didn't have a supporting act. Ciara opened shows for Rihanna on all UK dates in December and David Jordan opened for her on all March UK dates. Adam Tensta joined Rihanna on her March 2008 European dates. Chris Brown joined Rihanna and performed a full set list at the Australia, New Zealand and Philippines leg of the tour. In Mexico City Mexican pop star Maria Jose opened the show with a four-song set: her first three singles and her then brand-new single, "No Soy Una Señora", and the Spanish Singer, David Bisbal sing with Rihanna the Spanish remix of "Hate that I love you" in Mexico City . In December 2007, Rihanna cancelled the Good Girl Gone Bad concert in Nottingham, Birmingham and Bournemouth at very short notice under doctors orders. The Birmingham and Nottingham concerts were eventually rescheduled. During the Sydney, Australia concert on November 7, 2008, Rihanna ran off stage while performing "Umbrella" along with tourmate Chris Brown. TMZ reported that Rihanna may have felt ill due to air conditioning problem in the arena. The shows for February 12 and 13 in Asia were cancelled following Brown's assault on Rihanna.
Critical reception.
Mike Usinger of "The Georgia Straight" gave a mixed review of the concert in Vancouver at the GM Place saying, "the Barbados-born knockout has plenty to learn about keeping an audience engaged." However, Usinger commented that the "kindest thing you can say about Rihanna is that she's shown some improvement since her last visit. For a start, she no longer seems tone-deaf." Jason Macneil of Canadian Online Explorer gave a positive review of the concert during the show at Molson Amphitheatre, saying "the singer made a rather eye-popping impression, opening with Pon de Replay and clad in a sexy, dominatrix-like studded black leather ensemble." During a show planned for February 13 in Malaysia, Malaysia's conservative Islamic party recommended that Rihanna's concert tour should be banned from performing due to her skimpy outfits. The tour also received positive reviews for the live performance of Rihanna and the whole concept and outfits. Cheryl Leong of MTV Southeast Asia commented on the concert saying, "I did enjoy myself a whole lot at the concert. It just wasn't the most mindblowing. Nevertheless, she did what she does best, which is to bring out an entire collection of #1 singles 'live'."
Broadcast and recordings.
On September 24, 2007, the show from Bell Centre in Montreal, Canada, was recorded and made available for online broadcast on MSN Music. It quickly became popular and broke records, as it was viewed over one million times online in the first week only. Rihanna's concert was the most-streamed show by a single artist on MSN Music in 2007. Rihanna's concert in Ischgl, Austria, On December 1, 2007, was taped and aired on Austrian national television. The concert was free. The show from Manchester Arena in Manchester, England, on December 6, 2007, was recorded and later released on June 17, 2008, as a live DVD titled "Good Girl Gone Bad Live". The DVD also included the documentary of Rihanna and her band's journey and life on tour. The tour was also due to air on Channel 4 Christmas Day 2008[?]. On November 16, 2008, the concert held in Fort Bonifacio in Manila, Philippines, reached an audience of more than 70,000. The concert was sponsored by MTV Philippines and Globe Telecom.

Lacandonia

Lacandonia schismatica is the sole species of the genus Lacandonia and is endemic to the Lacandon Jungle in the Mexican state of Chiapas. It is known from very few populations and is considered endangered by the researchers who investigate this species. "L. schismatica" is a mycoheterotrophic species that contains no chlorophyll and has the unique characteristic of inverted positions of the male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) floral parts, something that had not been seen in any other plants with the occasional exception of some individuals of the related "Triuris brevistylis".
Description.
"L. schismatica" is a small saprophytic plant that lacks chlorophyll and has a rhizomatous, mycotrophic habit. This species exhibits racemous inflorescences and bract-like leaves. The flowers are actinomorphic and are considered "inverted" from the typical flower arrangement–usually 3 (but sometimes two to four) stamens are in the center of the flower surrounded by 60 to 80 pistils. This characteristic where the position of the androecium and the gynoecium are inverted is unique in the known and described taxa of flowering plants.
Flowers of "L. schismatica" are bisexual and self-pollinate and fertilize before the flower opens (preanthesis cleistogamy). They are true flowers as opposed to pseudanthia as had been suggested earlier in the literature. The three-celled pollen grains germinate within the anthers and the pollen tube grows through the receptacle to reach the ovaries. "L. schismatica" can be found flowering year-round when its environment is moist enough, with a particularly active flowering period in November and December. Owing to the prenathesis cleistogamy, a form of autogamy (self-pollination), the known population of "L. schismatica" lacks genetic variability and has a high instance of homozygosity. The haploid chromosome number of this species is n = 9.
Distribution and habitat.
"L. schismatica" is known from several small populations at altitudes around in the Lacandon Jungle, a rainforest in southeastern Mexico. It grows in shady sites within this rainforest. Gerrit Davidse and Esteban Martínez noted in 1990 how the plants are "extremely localized and highly endangered" due to encroaching habitat conversion to cattle pasture. They also explain that the species is difficult to cultivate and thus encourage other scientists to study this unique organism's biology before it can no longer be found in the wild.
Taxonomy and botanical history.
"L. schismatica" was first described by Martínez and Clara Hilda Ramos in 1989, who placed the species in its own family, Lacandoniaceae, which itself was placed in the Triuridales. In 1991, Traudel Rübsamen-Weustenfeld suggested that "L. schismatica" be included in the family Triuridaceae within the genus "Sciaphila", "Peltophyllum", or its own genus. Another study in 1998 presented data that supports the separation of "L. schismatica" into its own, monotypic family. The APG II system transferred the genus to the Triuridaceae and placed that family in the Pandanales.
Evolution.
The difficulty expressed in correctly placing the species in the proper family is due to the unique floral morphology. How this inverted position of the androecium and gynoecium evolved is unknown, but some studies have posed hypotheses. Davidse and Martínez suggested that "L. schismatica" could be one of Richard Goldschmidt's "hopeful monsters", meaning that the inverted floral morphology could have arisen from a macromutation in the genes that control floral development. It is also possible that chromosomal repatterning, also known as chromosomal rearrangement, was the origin of this species.
Since the original description and early work on this species in the 1990s, other field work has revealed some instances of "L. schismatica" flowers that were unisexual. The closely related species "Triuris brevistylis" was discovered to be mostly dioecious but a few individuals were located that had bisexual flowers with the flower arrangement inverted, just like that of the normal "L. schismatica" flowers. This discovery led the authors of the study to conclude that the inverted floral morphology evolved before "L. schismatica" and "T. brevistylis" diverged. Isolated populations during the Quaternary Period (around five million years ago) when temperatures in the Lacandon lowland rainforest were six to eight °C (10.8 to 14.4 °F) cooler than today. This hypothesis is supported by the geographic distribution where "L. schismatica" is restricted to the warmer lowlands and "T. brevistylis" has a distribution in the cooler highlands.

USS Ranger (SP-237)

The fifth USS "Ranger" (SP-237) was United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919.
"Ranger" was built as the steam-driven, steel-hulled yacht "Thomas Slocum" by Robert Jacob Shipyard at City Island, Bronx, New York, in 1910. She later was renamed "Ranger". The U.S. Navy purchased "Ranger" from her owner, T.W. Slocum of New York City, on 22 June 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel and commissioned her as USS "Ranger" (SP-237) on 9 October 1917 with Lieutenant J. J. Smith, USNRF, in command.
Assigned to the 3rd Naval District, "Ranger" operated as a section patrol craft in the New York City area. She was renamed USS "SP-237" in 1918.
"SP-237" was decommissioned on 28 April 1919 and transferred to the Department of Commerce for use by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. She served with the Survey as USC&GS "Ranger" until either 26 November 1930 or 31 January 1931, when she was returned to the U.S. Navy. She was stricken from the Navy List on 4 September 1931 and sold on 21 December 1931.
In 1932, registry of the vessel was transferred to Panama.
"Ranger" should not be confused with USS "Ranger" (SP-369), a coastal minesweeper also in commission during World War I, or USS "Ranger" (CC-4), a battlecruiser proposed during World War I but never completed.

<doc id="18240399" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18240399" title="Aggression insurance">
Aggression insurance

Aggression insurance is a concept in anarcho-capitalism under which, rather than having a civil authority provide security of life, liberty, and property, individuals would buy insurance to cover damage caused by others' aggression. A legal right would exist for a victim to collect damages from an offender; upon filing a claim and collecting money from the insurer, the right to restitution would be subrogated to the insurer, who would then have an incentive to find the offending party and demand restitution.
Proponents of this system argue that a victim would have a stronger incentive to report crimes, and that an insurer would have a stronger incentive than a civil authority to collect from the offending party and repay the victim for damages while reducing collateral damage and maximizing loss prevention. Moreover, proponents claim that insurers would guide citizens in the direction of purchasing effective countermeasures against aggression, by offering lower insurance premiums for reduced risk of claims.
Opponents of aggression insurance argue that such a system may harm or remove the notion of impartial justice by providing insurers incentive to always seek restitution rather than analyze whether restitution is warranted. Opponents also express concern over the possibility of those without such insurance having basic rights go unprotected.

Knox–Porter Resolution

The Knox–Porter Resolution () was a joint resolution of the United States Congress signed by President Warren G. Harding on July 2, 1921, officially ending United States involvement in World War I. The documents were signed on the estate of Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen, Sr. in Raritan, New Jersey. 
History.
On November 19, 1919, and again on March 19, 1920, the United States Senate voted against ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, forestalling American participation in the League of Nations. In a speech on April 12, 1921 before a special congressional session, President Harding reconfirmed American opposition to the League of Nations, calling on Congress to pass a peace resolution independent of the League. Senator Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania introduced a resolution the following day, and it passed the Senate in late April.
The United States House of Representatives had its own slightly different resolution introduced by Representative Stephen G. Porter, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Passage of the House resolution was delayed in deference to negotiations between the Allies and Germany over a reparations settlement. In late June the House and Senate reconciled their differences, and the Knox–Porter joint resolution passed Congress on July 1. Harding signed the resolution at the Frelinghuysen estate the next day. "War with Germany ended as it began, by Congressional declaration and Executive signature on American soil."

The 38 cm schwerer Ladungswerfer (38 cm sLdgW) was a spigot mortar used by Germany during World War II. It was used by engineers to demolish obstacles and strongpoints. It proved to be too heavy for its role and it was gradually withdrawn from front-line service.
Propellant was placed at the top of the spigot and ignited when the projectile slid far enough down the spigot to complete the electrical circuit. The spigot mortar was mounted on a traversing bracket on a drum-shaped platform that was staked to the ground. It fired HE and smoke rounds.

In April 1821 he along with Alexander Ralston received joint appointments as surveyors of Indianapolis.
Little else is known of Fordham. He was well educated and articulate as evidenced by his "Personal narrative of travels in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky : and of a residence in the Illinois Territory: 1817-1818" which was not published until 1906 (now out of print).

Tedald (bishop of Arezzo)

Tedald (c. 990 – 12 June 1036), also known as Theodald, Theodaldus, Tedaldus, Tedaldo, or Teodaldo, was the forty-third Bishop of Arezzo from 1023 until his death.
Tedald came from the highest ranks of the nobility of central Italy. He was the second son of Tedald, Count of Brescia, of the House of Canossa, and Willa, possible daughter of Theobald II of Spoleto. His elder brother was Boniface III of Tuscany. He was the uncle of Matilda of Tuscany, who was born after his death.
As bishop Tedald encouraged and protected the monastic life. He granted permission for Saint Romuald to found a monastery and a hermitage ("eremo") at Camaldoli in his diocese (c. 1024). Tedald also sponsored the work of the monk Guido of Arezzo, whose treatise on music theory, the "Micrologus", was dedicated to him. At Tedald's invitation, Guido took up the training of the cathedral singers at Arezzo around 1025. The bishop also supported the architect Maginardo, who added to the cathedral during his episcopate and was sent by Tedald in 1026 on a paid visit to Ravenna to study its Byzantine architecture.
He was succeeded in the diocese by Immo, a canon from Worms and chaplain at the court of Emperor Conrad II.

Gau March of Brandenburg

The Gau Mark Brandenburg was formed in 1933 initially under the name Gau Kurmark in Nazi Germany initially as a district within the Free State of Prussia. In 1935, Germany's constituent states were dissolved and the gaus replaced the states and their responsibilities. In 1940, Kurmark was renamed Mark Brandenburg. The gau was dissolved in 1945, following Allied Soviet occupation of the area and Germany's formal surrender in 1945. After the war, the territory of the former gau became part of the state of Brandenburg in East Germany.
