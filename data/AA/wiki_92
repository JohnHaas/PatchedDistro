USS Torch (1814)

USS "Torch" was a schooner -- heavily armed with guns and carronades -- in the United States Navy during the early years of the republic. She was built for service in the War of 1812, but did not see service until the Barbary Wars when she was sent with the American fleet to the Mediterranean to force an end to piracy of American ships.
Purchased for the War of 1812.
"Torch" -- a privateer schooner purchased at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1814 and initially commanded by Lt. Wolcott Chauncey—formed part of the "flying squadron" slated to cruise the West Indies to wage war on British commerce towards the end of the War of 1812. However, the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent on 18 February 1815 terminated hostilities before the squadron, then forming at New York City, could get to sea to undertake wartime operations.
Assigned to the Barbary Wars.
The kidnapping and piratical activities of the Algerians soon dispelled the hard-won peace which had so recently come to the United States. Only five days after hostilities with Great Britain ceased, the United States declared war on Algeria. Subsequently, a squadron under the command of Capt. Stephen Decatur, in "Guerriere", set sail from New York City on 20 May, bound for the Mediterranean.
On 19 June, the Americans made landfall off Cape Gata, Spain, and soon sighted "Mashouda", the frigate flying the flag of Algerian Admiral Rais Hammida. Giving chase, the Yankee squadron heavily damaged the enemy ship -- decapitating Hammida with a 32-pounder shot in the process—and forced her to surrender.
The remainder of the squadron set out in search of other Algerian vessels while "Mashouda" was sent to Cartagena, Spain under guard of "Macedonian". Off Cape Palos, Spain, this remainder spotted 22-gun brig "Estido" and bent on sail to make contact. The wily enemy, however, ran into shoal waters where the heavier American frigates feared to go for danger of running aground.
"Torch", whose shallower draft permitted her to give chase, joined "Epervier", "Spitfire", and "Spark" in forcing "Estido" aground. The Americans took possession of the enemy brig and 83 prisoners.
The successful conclusion of the campaign to force the Algerians to abandon their piratical ways followed thereafter.
"Torch" subsequently returned home to the United States and was sold on 3 April 1816.

Hollywood High (1977 film)

Hollywood High is a 1977 American sex comedy film. The film is generally regarded as being of very low quality, with one retrospective review calling it "a shockingly inept piece of teen sexploitation" and remarking, "Even for a dubious genre like this, this movie reaches a level of badness that would make even the most jaded exploitation filmmakers pause, and subsequently resolve never to reach such a low point. Practically every department in this movie - acting, writing, directing, etc. - is at the very bottom of the barrel." Despite its poor reception, the movie had an unofficial sequel, "Hollywood High Part 2", in 1981, which was likewise panned.
Unrelated series pilot.
Turner Classic Movies notes the existence of an unrelated 30-minute television pilot, also debuting in 1977, for a prospective series.

Race history.
The first Allen Crowe Memorial was held August 25, 1963. That race was won by NASCAR driver, Curtis Turner.
USAC era.
USAC's Stock Car division sanctioned the race from the race's inception in 1963, until the series' demise in 1984.
1972's race was an odd occurrence, in that Al Unser won the USAC Stock car race on Saturday, and then won the USAC Championship Dirt Car race the following day. The feat has never been repeated in the years since.
Co-sanctioning.
As USAC was downsizing its Stock car division, the 1983 and 1984 running of the Allen Crowe Memorial was co-sanctioned with ARCA.
ARCA era.
ARCA took over as sole sanctioning body in 1985. Beginning in 1989, the race was renamed the Coors Allen Crowe Memorial 100. In 1999, 2000, and 2001, the race was renamed the "Par-A-Dice 100", due to a new sponsor of the race. The race resumed the Allen Crowe Memorial moniker in 2002, and has kept it since.
Race Winners.
≠After setting a 100-mile record that has never been eclipsed, Marshman was killed later that year.
Tragedies.
There have been no deaths in the race attributed to crashes, however Four-time Allen Crowe Memorial 100 winner Dean Roper, whose son Tony Roper was killed in a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race 10 months earlier, suffered a heart attack on lap 17 of the 2001 race. Roper's car slowed on the frontstretch, then hit the inside retaining wall. He was unconscious when medical help arrived and later pronounced dead at Springfield Memorial Hospital.

Borden Flats Light

Borden Flats Light is a historic lighthouse on the Taunton River in Fall River, Massachusetts. It is a tower-on-caisson type known as a sparkplug lighthouse.
The light was built in 1881, and added to the National Register of Historic Places as Borden Flats Light Station on June 15, 1987, reference number 87001528.
History.
By the mid-19th century, the city of Fall River had become a bustling textile-mill town, with regularly scheduled steamboat service to Providence, Rhode Island and New York City. The city is located at the mouth of the Taunton River where it meets Mount Hope Bay, which is an arm of Narragansett Bay.
Prior to the lighthouse, an unlit day beacon was constructed to mark the spot of a dangerous reef near the center of the relatively shallow Mount Hope Bay. In June 1880, $25,000 was appropriated for the construction of a new lighthouse on Borden Flats, which consisted of a cast-iron tower that included a keeper's quarters. The light went into service on October 1, 1881, with a fourth-order Fresnel lens producing a fixed red light feet above mean high water. Rainwater was collected in gutters and stored in a cistern in the structure's basement level, providing the keeper's water supply.
The lighthouse, which sits in water open to the south, was battered in the hurricane of 1938. The storm left the structure with a pronounced tilt, which it still has. A new wider caisson was later added around the original one for additional protection.
In 1957 the lighthouse was electrified. It was automated in 1963. In 1977, its Fresnel lens was removed and replaced with a modern Vega VRB-25 lens. The fog bell remained in use until 1983 when it was replaced by an electronic foghorn. Under auspices of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000, the lighthouse was auctioned privately through the General Services Administration. Nick Korstad, Cindy Korstad and Craig Korstad, of Portland, Oregon are the new owners. They have plans of fully restoring the light station and making it available for public tours and overnight accommodations.

OK Motor Services

OK Travel was a bus and coach operator in County Durham, North East England. First established in 1912 as OK Motor Services, the company was bought by the Go-Ahead Group in the 1990s. Following rationalisation and rebranding, the OK livery disappeared from the roads as services were integrated with Go North East.
History.
OK Motor Services was founded in Evenwood, County Durham, by Wade Emmerson in 1912. The first route was from Evenwood to Bishop Auckland.
The original name was the Gaunless Valley Motor Services with the name OK coming from a consortium of operators who started to run from the area to the Great North Exhibition in Newcastle in the late 20s. The name OK was used and means just exactly what it says, the service was 'OK'.
The first garage was in Evenwood, with an office being opened within Bishop Auckland Town Hall during the early 1930s. The site of the main garage was acquired and developed during the 1930s in North Bondgate, Bishop Auckland DL14 7PG.
Further depot were opened at Heaton in Newcastle and two further depots were acquired with the business of F Lockey and Sons. This was their depot at St Helens Auckland, which became a central workshop for OK, and a smaller depot at Shotton Colliery.
During the early 1980s, the company replaced OK Motor Services name with OK Travel and introduced a simplified version of the eye catching livery of Dark Red, Light Red and Cream.
After deregulation, OK acquired two further depots, one at Gateshead to replace the Heaton depot. A brand new depot was built at Peterlee, which replaced the depot at Shotton Colliery.
OK Travel operated widely throughout the area with the majority of its services being in south Tyne & Wear and Durham. By 1994 it had 212 vehicles with an average age of about 11 years, and had bought 47 new vehicles in the preceding year.
Go-Ahead takeover.
Go-Ahead Group had already made approaches to Wade Emmerson Snr, who ran the business, but the shareholders had no interest in selling it. However, Go-Ahead was told that if the business did become available for sale, they would be given first refusal.
Wade Emmerson senior died unexpectedly in August 1994. Wade Emmerson Jnr, OK's majority shareholder, was approached by Go-Ahead, which expressed its continued interest in acquiring the business. He was also approached by other operators including Northumbria Motor Services Ltd, the British Bus subsidiary in the North-East, but decided to enter detailed negotiations only with Go-Ahead. In March 1995, Go-Ahead acquired OK Motor Services Ltd and the related OK Motor Services (Travel) Limited and OK Travel (Inclusive Tours) Limited companies for £5.4 million.
Many of OK's staff, including its general manager, Charles Marshall, became employees of Go-Ahead following the acquisition. OK initially became one of Go-Ahead's locally managed subsidiaries with Marshall remaining in charge. Following the acquisition, Go-Ahead took steps to streamline the management of its north-east bus businesses and, as part of that reorganization, several of its earlier acquisitions were transferred to OK. However, the local identities were soon abandoned, and the OK name disappeared.
The garage at Bishop Auckland was demolished, with a few services transferred to Go Ahead's depot at Chester-le-Street, with the more local services transferring to Arriva at Bishop Auckland.
On 15 December 2011, Go North East announced that the OK Travel livery will be revived on a new service by the operator 18/OK1. Starting Monday 23 January 2012, two new bus services were launched in Crook. The OK1 service provided a direct link to Darlington, West Auckland and Middlesbrough from Crook every 30 minutes Monday to Saturday daytimes. Branded "The OK Expressway", in recognition of the old OK Travel brand the service provided a direct service to Darlington and Middlesbrough every 30 minutes on Monday to Saturday daytimes from Crook. Where 18 is a local Bishop Auckland bus and branded "The OK Way". The OK Way uses 2 Dennis Dart Transbus MPD cascaded from Saltmeadows where The OK Expressway uses 4 Scania Wright Solar cascaded from Deptford both run out out of Crook (Outstation to Chester-le-Street). Another bus was launched at the same time to mark the occasion OK Motor Services this can appear on 18 The OK Way/OK1 The OK Expressway/X20/X21/X46 Pronto this bus was also cascaded from Deptford.
As of August 10th 2013 Go North East finished operations with its OK Expressway OK1 Service as a result of a fall in Passenger Numbers towards the end of its 18 Month Trial. 
Former depots.
In 1991 the former service depot of Leyland Truck and Bus in the Team Valley Trading Estate, Gateshead, was obtained.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (or other combinations with airway or hyperreactivity) is a state characterised by easily triggered bronchospasm (contraction of the bronchioles or small airways).
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be assessed with a bronchial challenge test. This most often uses products like methacholine or histamine. These chemicals trigger bronchospasm in normal individuals as well, but people with bronchial hyperresponsiveness have a lower threshold.
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a hallmark of asthma but also occurs frequently in people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the Lung Health Study, bronchial hyperresponsiveness was present in approximately two-thirds of patients with non-severe COPD, and this predicted lung function decline independently of other factors. In asthma it tends to be reversible with bronchodilator therapy, while this is not the case in COPD.

Promise (computing)

A promise is the final item in a stream. A stream itself is a way to shorten a very long sequence into a short one, and request only the items needed at the moment. For example, in pseudocode, assuming intseq reports an integer sequence up to its input:
For long computations, like intseq(10000), a program may not immediately need a list containing 10,000 elements. Upon a closer look at intseq, it may look something like this:
If not all integers were needed immediately, it would be more efficient to return a promise instead. A stream_intseq may look like this (in pseudocode):
In this way, a way to invoke (generated by way_to_invoke) the next operation is returned after a custom value that defines the end of data input (in this case, "*end*"). When needed, the caller can use the handle generated by way_to_invoke to invoke the next result. This will be added to the data part of the list, and the next invocation will be stored. For example, for stream_intseq(5), through all invocations:
Notice the one extra invocation of stream_intseq, that is determined afterward to be empty. This is normal, as it happens to intseq as well.
There is also another kind of promise, that people may use now and then. 
To learn more about promise, check the definition below.
1 A declaration or assurance that one will do a particular thing or that a particular thing will happen.
Here are some synonyms :
assurance, pledge, vow, guarantee, oath, bond, undertaking, and other definitions.

Whatcom Middle School, home of the Wildcats, is a middle school located in Bellingham, WA. With enrollment of 606 students in 2006-2007, it was the largest of four middle schools in the Bellingham School District. It was also the oldest existing school building in the Bellingham School District. On November 5, 2009, a fire broke out and caused irreparable damage to the school building. Since the fire, students have been dispersed to the three other Bellingham School District middle schools, and some sixth graders will remain at their elementary schools for the 2010-2011 school year. The building is expected to be rebuilt on the same site, and is expected to take two to three years to complete.
History.
In 1903, North Side High School was built to service the city of Bellingham, the conglomerate of four communities that surrounded Bellingham Bay - Whatcom, Bellingham, Sehome, and Fairhaven. In 1916, additional construction doubled the size of the building, and the name was changed to Whatcom High School. In 1937, Bellingham High School was built, and the students from Whatcom High School were moved to the new building. The old building became Whatcom Junior High for grades 7-9. The school was reorganized into Whatcom Middle School in 1967 to serve grades 6-8. 
The school was heavily damaged in a major early morning fire on November 5, 2009 while undergoing a retrofit. As of November 2010, the fire was revealed to be accidental. The fire was related to the welding work at Whatcom Middle School, as the Bellingham Fire Department revealed.

Basic Chess Endings

Basic Chess Endings (abbreviated BCE) is a book on chess endgames which was written by Grandmaster Reuben Fine and originally published on October 27, 1941. It is considered the first systematic book in English on the endgame phase of the game of chess. It is the best-known endgame book in English and is a classic piece of chess endgame literature. The book is dedicated to World Champion Emanuel Lasker, who died in 1941 (the year the book was published). It was revised in 2003 by Pal Benko. 
Cecil Purdy said "... "Basic Chess Endings" is a monumental work, one of the most complete and authoritative on endgames in any language." 
__TOC__
History.
"Basic Chess Endings" was written by Reuben Fine in only four months and was published in 1941 by McKay (a division of Random House) in hardback. The book used the now obsolete descriptive chess notation and used the old system of using the abbreviation "Kt" to stand for knight instead of the more modern "N".
In a 1984 interview, Fine said that it took him three months to write the book. He said that organizing the material gave him no trouble, but it was hard work coming up with example positions. He created many of the examples . There was a Hardback Limited Edition of 500 signed By Ruben Fine sold by USCF in the 1940s. The hardback edition was reprinted at least as late as 1960. The copyright was renewed in 1969 as the book went through many paperback impressions. The cover of the 1971 paperback printing is shown at the right. It went through ten printings in paperback by 1981.
Over the years, many errors were found, and many of them were published in "Chess Life" in the column by Larry Evans . Over one hundred such errors were found and a mimeographed list of them was printed and circulated by Paul L. Crane and Rev. David Chew. An 18-page booklet containing over 200 corrections was published by Samuel Louie in 1990 and 1993. Despite these errors, the book remained in print in its original form. After many years, editor Burt Hochberg finally convinced the publisher to create a new edition. Endgame expert Pal Benko, whose own copy of the book contained hand-written notes of almost all of the errors, did the revision. The revised edition was published in 2003, but only in paperback. Benko converted it to the now universally-accepted algebraic chess notation. He also added some new material based on more recent analysis and added many new examples. He made many corrections, but a few errors remain. For example, Benko repeats Fine's claim that the endgame of two bishops and a knight against a rook is drawn with correct play . In fact, endgame tablebases show that the three minor pieces win . Howard Staunton, without the aid of computer analysis, had recognized this over 150 years earlier . Bernhard Horwitz and Josef Kling gave the same appraisal in 1851 .
The original book contains 573 pages and 607 diagrams of positions. Many other positions were given by listing the location of the pieces rather than showing a diagram. The 2003 revision contains 587 pages with 1330 positions, most with diagrams.
Impact.
Larry Evans listed it in his "basic chess library" and said that it was "distinguished by lucidity and keen organization" . Copies of the book are owned by many generations of chess players around the world. World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik considered it the best book on the endgame. Yuri Averbakh (who wrote the five-volume "Comprehensive Chess Endings" and "Chess Endings: Essential Knowledge") based his research on this book. 
Many other books have listed BCE as a reference, including "Mastering the Endgame", "Practical Endgame Play", and "Starting Out: Pawn Endings" by Glenn Flear; "Fundamental Chess Endings" and "Secrets of Pawn Endings" by Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht; "How to Play Chess Endgames" by Karsten Müller and Wolfgang Pajeken; "Winning Chess Endings" by Yasser Seirawan; "Silman's Complete Endgame Course" by Jeremy Silman; "101 Chess Endgame Tips" by Stephen Giddins; "Rook Endings" by Grigory Levenfish and Vasily Smyslov; "Tactical Chess Endings" by John Nunn, "On the Endgame" by Cecil Purdy; and "Essential Chess Endings" by James Howell.

Except for the last two chapters, all of the other chapters have sub-chapters based on pawn distribution or positional factors. Many of those sub-chapters have sections and subsections.
Review by John Nunn.
Grandmaster John Nunn wrote a review of "Basic Chess Endings", both the original version and the revised edition. A paraphrasing of his review follows.
"This is a classic book... The quality of the general explanations is excellent and probably has never been surpassed. ... Fine is at his best when he gives general descriptions and the book has been rightly praised for its instructional value. ... However, there are many errors in the concrete analysis of positions. ... The quality of the general explanations compensates for the errors and makes it well worth reading. ... The only exception is the chapter on queen endings, which has advanced greatly since 1941, and much of the material is seriously misleading."
On Benko's revision, "A chance to bring this classic up to date was squandered. ... The layout has been improved, but still many positions are without diagrams and some positions have been removed. ... There is a small amount of new material, but it is mostly from Benko's games and studies, and some of the new material has been added clumsily. ... The chapter on queen endings has not been changed to reflect the discoveries since 1941. ... The greatest disappointment is the failure to correct many of the errors in the original book, some of which are well-known. ... No systematic computer-checking of the analysis was done. ... Some errors have been corrected but many remain. ... Despite this, the book is recommended for Fine's groundbreaking general explanations, but it is not completely accurate or up-to-date" .

Tarazona Cathedral

Tarazona Cathedral (Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Huerta de Tarazona, originally "Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Hidria" or "Nuestra Señora de la Huerta o de la Vega") is situated in Tarazona, Zaragoza province, Spain. Its architecture is representative of the Gothic and Mudéjar style, and is one of the few remaining examples of this type of architecture, along with Teruel Cathedral.
Construction on this cathedral first began in the 12th century in the French Gothic style, and it was consecrated in 1232.
The cathedral was located outside of the city walls, which was unusual, and may have been caused by the fact that there was an ancient Mozarabic church on the site which had been located outside of the formerly Muslim city.
In the fourteenth century, being outside of the city walls, it was assaulted and destroyed during the War of the Two Peters. Its naves were then rebuilt in Mudéjar style, as well as its lateral chapels, exterior walls, dome (cimborio), and tower. The tower was rebuilt in the fifteenth century.
The monastery at Veruela was built nearby in Gothic style.
In 1984, a major restoration of the cathedral was begun. In February 2012, Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia marked the completion of the restoration, with the President of Aragon, Luisa Fernanda Rudi, and the Bishop of Tarazona.

USS Viper (1814)

USS "Viper" was a heavily armed row galley commissioned by the United States Navy for service in the War of 1812. She was successful in her operations against the British on Lake Champlain, and was retired after the war.
Built in Vermont.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Viper" was one of six large row galleys hastily built and commissioned in the mid-1814 at Vergennes, Vermont, for use by Commodore Thomas Macdonough against the British on Lake Champlain.
Service in the War of 1812.
Under the command of Lieutenant Francis Mitchell, "Viper" participated in the capture of the British squadron, under Commodore George Downie, off Plattsburg, New York, on 11 September 1814, where she helped drive the surviving enemy gunboats back towards Canada. 
This American naval victory ended English attempts to invade and split the United States in two by way of the Lake Champlain-Hudson River corridor, immeasurably strengthening the American bargaining position during peace negotiations at Ghent. "Viper" remained with the squadron for the remainder of the war but, with the return of peace, was partially dismantled and laid up at Whitehall, New York.
Post-war disposition.
"Viper" was sold at Whitehall at public sale in 1825.

<doc id="18529481" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18529481" title="Typeof">
Typeof

Typeof (alternately typeof or TypeOf) is an operator provided by several programming languages which determines the data type of a given variable. This can be useful when constructing parts of programs that need to accept many types of data but may need to take different action depending on the type of data provided.
In languages that support polymorphism and type casting, the typeof operator can have one of two distinct meanings when applied to an object. In some languages, such as Visual Basic, the typeof operator returns the dynamic type of the object. That is, it tells the program what the true, original type of the object is, irrespective of any type casting. In these languages, the typeof operator is the method for obtaining run-time type information.
In other languages, such as C# or D and some nonstandard extensions to C and C++, the typeof operator returns the static type of the object. That is, it tells the program what type the object is declared to be at that point in the program, irrespective of its original form. These languages usually have other constructs for obtaining run-time type information, such as typeid.
Examples.
The C# variant of "typeof" should be translated into the VB.NET's GetType method. TypeOf keyword in VB.NET is used to compare an object reference variable to a data type.
The following example uses TypeOf...Is expressions to test the type compatibility of two object reference variables with various data types.

Gohain's surfaces are heavily “worked” rather than "painted". In 2008, Gohain said, “Works are not only paintings, working on the surfaces is very sculptural. I use graphite like clay”. 
She has participated in several group shows in San Francisco, New Jersey, Mumbai, Bangalore, Nagpur, Baroda, Chandigarh and Bhopal. Her solo shows include one at Nazar Art Gallery, in Baroda (1999), 'Harmony' - a collaborative show with her husband Ganesh Gohain at The Fine Art Company, Mumbai, 'Existence' at The Fine Art Company (2002), Mumbai, 'Silent Speech' in Ahmedabad and Vadodara by Alliance Française (2004), and "Silent Speech" at the Museum Art Gallery by The Fine Art Company(2006), Mumbai.

Knotting is a small village in Bedfordshire, located near the border with Northamptonshire. Nearby places are, Sharnbrook, Podington, Odell, Melchbourne, Yielden, Newton Bromswold, Souldrop and Rushden over the border in Northamptonshire.
Population.
The parish was covered by the 2001 UK Census but was combined with neighbouring Souldrop. In 2001, there was a combined population of 269 people - in 110 households. In 1831, there were just 135 inhabitants of Knotting alone, therefore it is possible that the population has not really altered.
Parish Church.
The Parish Church is partly of 12th century Norman construction, including a chancel arch with carved decoration, and is dedicated to St Margaret. The registers date from 1592 and many of these are deposited at the Bedfordshire and Luton Archives and Records Service. The church was vested with the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 April 2009.

William of Macclesfield

William of Macclesfield (died 1303-4) was an English Dominican theologian, with the nickname "Doctor Inclytus". He was created Cardinal in December 1303 by Pope Benedict XI; it is unclear whether this was before his death.
Life.
He was born, according to the "Dictionnaire des Cardinaux", at Coventry, during the pontificate Pope Innocent IV (i.e. between 1243 and 1254). He became a friar-preacher at Coventry and completed his education in the ‘gymnasium sanjacobeum’ (the seminary of the Jacobins, or Dominican friar-preachers) at Paris, where he proceeded B.D. Returning to England he was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1291, and proceeded D.D. 
He lectured in Oxford and was an authority on the Bible, taking part also in the controversies of the time and confuting the heresies of William Delamere. In clerical politics he was a disciplinarian. 
In 1303 he represented his order on the nomination, it is supposed, of Edward I, at the synod of Besançon. Benedict XI nominated him cardinal priest with the title of St. Sabina on 18 December 1303, but it is doubtful whether the news reached him, as he died while on his way to England early in 1304. Walter Winterburn (died 1305), confessor to the king and also a friar-preacher, was at once made cardinal of St. Sabina in his stead.

Alternant code

In coding theory, alternant codes form a class of parameterised error-correcting codes which generalise the BCH codes.
Definition.
An "alternant code" over GF("q") of length "n" is defined by a parity check matrix "H" of alternant form "H""i","j" = αji"y""i", where the α"j" are distinct elements of the extension GF("q""m"), the "y""i" are further non-zero parameters again in the extension GF("q""m") and the indices range as "i" from 0 to δ − 1, "j" from 1 to "n".
Properties.
The parameters of this alternant code are length "n", dimension ≥ "n" − "m"δ and minimum distance ≥ δ + 1.
There exist long alternant codes which meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
The class of alternant codes includes

Marion Rice Denishawn

Marion Rice Denishawn or Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers is a dance company devoted to preserving Denishawn dance, the choreography of modern dance pioneers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, taught and staged by Marion Rice, a Massachusetts modern dance and ballet teacher, performer, choreographer and producer who died in 1995.
Marion Rice dedicated her creative life to teaching, preserving, protecting and performing the fifty or so dance works taught to her by Ruth St. Denis, Ted Shawn, Miriam Winslow and other modern dance luminaries while she was a student and performer at the Boston Braggiotti School in Boston in the early 1900s. Along with members of her family, daughter Carolyn Brown, daughter-in-law Mona Irvine Rice, granddaughters Robin Rice and Rebecca Rice, these Denishawn dances have been performed by Marion Rice and her students for over 75 years.
"Marion Rice Denishawn" performed in Fitchburg, Massachusetts as well as 
at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1972, the Marymount Manhattan Theater (New York) in 1976 and City College (New York) in 1986 at the ""Roots: Foundations of American Modern Dance" Festival".[
In 2000, "Marion Rice Denishawn" performed at the "Dance in Millennium" Festival in Washington. The company presented "Boston Braggiotti and Denishawn", a lecture demonstration illuminating a select number of the early Denishawn works.
Village Voice critic Deborah Jowitt wrote about the performance in the following review:
Ruth St. Denis, American mystic, and Ted Shawn, entrepreneur, were a great team. During the glory days of their Denishawn company—roughly 1916 to 1931—a gifted disciple could obtain a franchise and open a Denishawn school. For a price, a young dancer could learn a colorful routine and secure its sheet music and costume design. Last month, two companies—the Marion Rice Denishawn dancers at the "Dancing in the Millennium" conference in Washington, D.C., and Dansarté, at Jacob's Pillow—presented programs of dances by St. Denis, Shawn, and their pupils.
What's intriguing about these dances—learned by Robin and Rebecca Rice at their grandmother's studio, and from Shawn at Jacob's Pillow in 1942 and 1943 by Dansarté's director, Sharry Underwood—is the way they combine the notion of art dance with a vaudeville structure. They tend to be about three minutes long, with reassuring amounts of repetition, structured in A-B-A form. Shawn and St. Denis captured the look and ambience of "exotic" styles, if not their steps. Dansarté's beautiful Maris Wolff, gorgeously costumed, performs an orientalist's dream of an Indian "nautch" dance—all rippling midriff, swaying steps, and flirtatious glances. Rice dancer Laurie Cameron appears for the circa 1930 fantasy La Peri (by either St. Denis or Miriam Winslow, who took over the Boston Denishawn school of the Braggiotti sisters), wafting swags of material that depend from her cap. The heelwork that Dansarté's Jean-Marie Mellichamp beats out in Viva Faroan has the air of flamenco without its now familiar complexities. In the early 20th century, what did American audiences know or care about authenticity?
On these fine programs, you can see the influence of Isadora Duncan in Chopin dances performed with lovely sincerity by the Rices, or get a whiff of German modernism in Miriam Marmein's circa 1932 mime, Argument des Boulevardiers, in which Valerie Farias Newton and Rebecca Rice wear mannish attire and gesticulate with rhythmic fury. Jess Meeker's music for Shawn's Gypsy-Rondo-Bout-Town nudges Dansarté's Genevieve Pellman and Neth Urkiel-Taylor from Haydn to swing. In all these early pieces, theatrical traditions, fashion, and experiment tiptoe toward modern dance.

Sydney – A Story of a City

Sydney – A Story of a City is a film originally shot in the IMAX format and shown in IMAX cinemas around Australia in 1999. The film was subsequently digitally re-mastered from the original large film format and released on DVD in 2001.
The film presents the viewer with spectacular scenes of the city, its harbour, the Sydney Opera House and the Blue Mountains and uses archive film footage, computer generated graphics combined with live footage to tell the story of Sydney's past and present. Featuring the themes of history, archaeology, architecture and genealogy with a simple love story, the film educates and entertains and serves as a showcase for the vibrant city of Sydney.
Plot.
'Virginia" (Lucy Bell), a young and adventurous woman, travels from England to Sydney, Australia, in search of her Australian ancestors. Her grandfather "William Robertson" had travelled from Sydney to England in the 1930s, falling in love with an English girl and marrying her. He joined the RAAF at the onset of World War II, only to be killed in an air battle over France. Virginia carries with her some documents of her grandfather's to try to find out what his life was like in Australia all those years ago. She meets her Great Aunt "Clara" who, while happy to tell her of the city's origins, does not expand on the history of William Robertson. Virginia intensifies her efforts to find the truth and comes across a reference to a Robertson who lived at Cumberland Street in The Rocks area of the city. 
On arriving at the site she discovers an archaeological dig in progress where once stood some of the oldest buildings in Sydney. Here she meets a young archaeologist called "Marco" (Paul Mercurio) who assists her in her search for answers. The couple research all available resources, travelling around the city and its suburbs, and spend a lot of time in each other's company. During her quest for answers Virginia discovers some of the history and legends surrounding the city of Sydney, its cultural diversity and its famous landmarks. As her quest finally nears completion and it shall soon be time for her to return to England, Virginia discovers that not only has she fallen in love with Marco, she has also fallen in love with the city of Sydney.

The Fountain of Youth (film)

The Fountain of Youth is a 1956 TV pilot for a proposed Desilu TV series (with a tentative title, "The Orson Welles Show") which was never produced, and was subsequently televised once, on September 16, 1958 for NBC's "Colgate Theatre". The short film was directed by Orson Welles, based on the short story "Youth from Vienna" by John Collier, and stars Joi Lansing and Rick Jason as a couple faced with an unavoidable temptation concocted by a scientist (Dan Tobin). Welles himself is also much in evidence as onscreen narrator. The show won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1958 after its single broadcast. 
Welles used an extremely innovative process of stills and live action not seen on film before or since. Leading man Rick Jason devoted a chapter called "Orson Welles and Feet of Clay" in his online autobiography, "Scrapbooks of My Mind", to the making of the film, carefully detailing the unique approaches Welles employed to arrive at the film's striking result.
The show remains available for viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles.

List of amateur radio frequency bands in India

Amateur radio or ham radio is a hobby that is practised by over 16,000 licenced users in India.
Licences are granted by the Wireless and Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC), a branch of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. In addition, the WPC allocates frequency spectrum in India. The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Service) Rules, 1978 lists five licence categories:
To obtain a licence, candidates must pass the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate examination conducted by the WPC. The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of Morse code proficiency in sending and receiving. After passing the examination, the candidate must clear a police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen call sign. This procedure can take up to one year. This licence is valid for up to five years.
Each licence category has certain privileges allotted to it, including the allotment of frequencies, output power, and the emission modes. This article list the various frequencies allotted to various classes, and the corresponding emission modes and input DC power.
Allotted spectrum.
The following table lists the frequencies that amateur radio operators in India can operate on.
Emission designations.
The International Telecommunication Union uses an internationally agreed system for classifying radio frequency signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified according to its bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.
An emission designation is of the form BBBB 123 45, where BBBB is the bandwidth of the signal, 1 is a letter indicating the Type of modulation used, 2 is a digit representing the Type of modulating signal, 3 is a letter corresponding to the Type of information transmitted, 4 is a letter indicating the practical details of the transmitted information, and 5 is a letter that represents the method of multiplexing. The 4 and 5 fields are optional. For example, an emission designation would appear read as 500H A3E, where 500H translates to 500 Hz, and A3E is the emission mode as permitted.
The WPC has authorized the following emission modes:
Licence categories.
Formerly four classes of licence were established in India; after 2009 only two categories of amateur radio licence exist. 
Grade II Restricted (Migrated to Restricted Grade since 13 August 2013).
The Restricted Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence licence required a minimum score of 40% in each section of the written examination, and 50% overall. The minimum age is 12 years. The licence allows a user to make terrestrial radiotelephony (voice) transmission in two VHF frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 10 W.
Restricted Grade.
The Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence, Restricted licence requires the same scores as the old term Grade II.The minimum age is 12 years. The licence allows the user to make radiotelegraphy (Morse code) and radiotelephony transmission in 12 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 50 W.
A Restricted Grade licence holder can only be authorized the use of radio telephony emission on frequency bands below 30 MHz on submission of proof that 100 contacts have been made with other amateur operators using CW (Morse code).
General Grade.
The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, requires a minimum of 50% in each section of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving Morse code at 8 words per minute (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400 W since 13 August 2010 (was 150 W earlier). In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.
Advanced Grade (Merged with General Grade since 13 August 2013).
The Advanced Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence was the highest licence category. Merged with General Grade since 13 August 2010. To obtain the licence, an applicant must be 18 years of age. pass an advanced electronics examination, along with the Rules and Regulations section and Morse code sending and receiving at 12 words per minute. The maximum power permitted is 400 W in selected sub-bands.

Danish Naval Air Squadron

The Danish Navy Air Squadron (), was the aerial component of the Danish navy, from 1977 to 2010-12-31. Operationally it was directly under command of the Danish Naval Command, but maintenance of the eight Westland Lynx helicopters and training of personnel was in cooperation with the air force. The helicopters were used primarily for fishery patrol, shipboard support and coastal Search & Rescue (SAR) missions.
The tasks and hardware have now been transferred to the air force as Eskadrille 723 ("Squadron 723").
History.
The squadron was originally a flight in the air force "eskadrille 722" (722nd Squadron) when the first Alouette III helicopter was received in 1962. In 1977 the flight was made into a unit of its own and became a part of the navy, under the name "Søværnets Flyvetjeneste" ("The Naval Air Service").
In 1980-1982 the eight Alouette helicopters were replaced with the new Westland Lynx helicopters.
In 2000 it was decided that "Søværnets Flyvetjeneste" should be transferred to the air force as a squadron ("728th Squadron") and put under operational command of the air force command along with the Army Air Corps ("Hærens Flyvetjeneste"), but for a political reason only the army units were transferred to the air force (as "724th Squadron"). At the same time, all the Danish helicopter units were also to move physically from "Værløse Air Station" and "Vandel Air Station" to "Karup Air Station". The total number of helicopters in the air force would have been 8 Sikorsky S-61A, 13 Eurocopter AS550C2 Fennec, 16 Hughes H-500C Cayuse and 8 Westland Lynx Mk.90B as well as 14 AgustaWestland EH-101 Merlin under purchase - a grand total of 59 helicopters. International obligations didn't allow for the Danish air force to possess so many helicopters. Because of that the Naval Air Service was transformed into the Naval Air Squadron on 1 January 2004.
A Danish navy helicopter foiled a pirate attack off Somali coast, 28 August 2010.

Hill of Allen

The Hill of Allen ("Cnoc Alúine" in Modern Irish, earlier "Cnoc Almaine"; also Hill of Almu ) is a volcanic hill situated in the west of County Kildare, Ireland, beside the village of Allen. According to Irish Mythology it was the seat of the hunter-warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Fianna. The site is currently part-owned by Roadstone Dublin Ltd. and extensive quarrying has noticeably changed the profile of the hill.
History.
The hill is situated at the easternmost point of the Bog of Allen and it is from this hill that the bog gets its name. According to legend, Fionn mac Cumhaill had a fortress on the hill and used the surrounding flatlands as training grounds for his warriors. In 722 the Battle of Allen was fought between the Leinstermen (Laigin), led by Murchad mac Brain Mut (King of Leinster), and the forces of Fergal mac Máele Dúin (High King of Ireland) in close proximity to the hill.
Tower.
In 1859 Sir Gerard George Aylmer, the 9th Baronet of Donadea began building a circular tower on the top of the hill, which was completed in 1863. The tower was a folly and the names of the workmen are inscribed on the steps.
During the construction of the tower a large coffin containing human bones was unearthed which were said to be those of Fionn mac Cumhaill. These were re-interred under the site.
Quarry.
As of 2008 most of the site is under the ownership of Roadstone Dublin Ltd. and much of the western side of the hill has been quarried.

'Arab al-Jahalin

'Arab al-Jahalin also known as al-Jabal (; ) is a Palestinian Bedouin village in the Jerusalem Governorate, located five kilometers southeast of Jerusalem in the West Bank. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), 'Arab al-Jahalin had a population of approximately 1,205 inhabitants in mid-year 2006. The village is situated on a hillside outside of al-Eizariya and 300 meters away from the Jerusalem Municipal dump. It is located in Area C of the West Bank — giving Israel full control over the village, however the populace hold Palestinian IDs. 
'Arab al-Jahalin contains a mosque, a seven-class school and a 12-class school. The village is linked to the East Jerusalem
electricity system and has running water. As-Sawahira ash Sharqiya shares the facilities, particularly schools and health amenities with the villages of 'Arab al-Jahalin, Jabal Mukaber and ash-Sheikh Sa'd. The healthcare facilities for as-Sawahira ash Sharqiya are designated as Ministry of Health level 2. All residents of the 'Arab al-Jahalin are considered refugees and have UNRWA refugee papers.
History.
The 'Arab al-Jahalin tribe were originally based around Tel Arad in the northern Negev, but were entirely evicted from the area in the early 1950s by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Prior to Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, they were traveling and herding their livestock between Ramallah, Wadi Qelt and Jerusalem, maintaining the traditional Bedouin lifestyle. In particular, the 'Arab al-Jahalin bred sheep. After the war, the IDF confiscated most of the al-Jahalin lands and as a result, tribe members settled in area beside the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim outside Jerusalem. 
In July 1994, the IDF issued an eviction order, which provoked tribe members to appeal to the Supreme Court of Israel which rejected their appeal. Throughout the 1990s there were 100-120 military or court orders for the eviction of al-Jahalin Bedouin. The mass eviction occurred in 1996 when all 4,000 members of 'Arab al-Jahalin tribe were evicted from their encampments. However, in 1998, another appeal resulted in a deal between the Israeli Civil Administration and representatives of 35 al-Jahalin families (about 200 individuals) who were permitted to "lease state lands" that originally belonged to the Palestinian town of Abu Dis. Thus, the village of 'Arab al-Jahalin was founded.
In 2012, plans to relocate the tribe adjacent to the Abu Dis garbage dump were dropped and the Civil Administration will select a different site. This plan has since been revived. A documentary film about the current status of the Jahalin was released in April 2012.

The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation

The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation was founded by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales in 1979 and is one of the largest independent foundations in the UK.
Overview.
The work of the Charitable Foundation is two-fold:
Mission.
Inspired by HRH The Prince of Wales’s values of harmony and sustainability, the Charitable Foundation aims through its grant making and other charitable activities to transform lives and build sustainable communities. This is achieved locally through supporting causes such as community projects, nationally through grants to charities such as Plantlife International, The Prince’s Trust, Soil Association and the Rare Breeds Survival Trust and globally through the Charitable Foundation’s International Sustainability Unit. 
The Prince's International Sustainability Unit.
The International Sustainability Unit (ISU) is an initiative of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation. The ISU works to facilitate consensus on how to resolve some of the key environmental challenges facing the world, specifically those to do with food security, ecoystems resilience and the depletion of natural capital. To achieve this, the ISU brings together partners from across government, private and NGO sectors to pilot practical programmes in marine and sustainable agriculture. The impact of the work of the ISU is evident in Ghana, Indonesia, Liberia and Brazil where it has pioneered projects to slow deforestation. The ISU has also published two key pieces of research on the economic opportunity of sustainably managed fisheries and sustainable food production. 
The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) Project.
The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability (A4S)Project is part of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation. The A4S project and its affiliate organisation the International Integrated Reporting Council (the IIRC), encourages the responsible business community to recognize the benefits of considering the environment and wider society as part of their day-to-day business decisions; and establish a global framework for integrated corporate reporting.
The Place Strategy.
The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation supports The Prince’s Charities to work collaboratively in communities such as Burnley, Tottenham, Redcar (Middlesbrough), Burslem (Stoke-on-Trent), East Ayrshire and Llandovery. In the last decade, The Prince of Wales has been determined to encourage his charities to work collaboratively and make more impact in disadvantaged communities. The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation supports this work, which goes under the banner of "The Place Strategy".
In 2007, His Royal Highness consulted local community leaders in Burnley as to whether The Prince’s Charities – working in partnership - could support the regeneration of the town. With the encouragement of public, private and voluntary sector leaders a five year programme began involving twelve of The Prince's Charities working across the built environment, young people and education, business and enterprise support, and community and arts engagement. The Prince of Wales has visited Burnley to see progress three times over the five years and convened a regeneration summit in May 2012 in the presence of Her Majesty The Queen.
An independent evaluation undertaken by Cass Business School in 2011 concluded that no other organisation or group of charities could have played the same role, or achieved as much, as The Prince’s Charities working together. In particular, the convening power of His Royal Highness ensured a greater buy-in from stakeholders, supported by project co-ordinators from within The Prince’s Charities who provided a strong focus. Through the Place Strategy, The Prince's Charities aim to transform lives and build sustainable communities.
Transforming lives - The combined resources of The Prince’s Charities can be best seen in its work in education where Burnley schools have benefited from Business Class (a programme led by Business in the Community), XL Clubs (which is run by The Prince’s Trust), The Prince’s Foundation for Children and the Arts' primary school programme and Development Programmes for Heads of Department run by The Prince’s Teaching Institute .
Building sustainable communities - The Prince’s Foundation for Building Community has helped create focused partnerships with local stakeholders to build sustainable communities. Heritage regeneration projects in East Ayrshire (Dumfries House), Burnley (The Weavers Triangle) and Burslem (Middleport Pottery) provide a focus for involving the resources and capabilities of other Prince's Charities, particularly The Prince’s Regeneration Trust, START (Business in the Community) and The Prince’s School for Traditional Arts.
Dumfries House.
The Foundation was one of a group of organisations and individuals involved in the purchase of Dumfries House in 2007. The Art Fund acted as the formal legal purchaser of the house and its contents, which were then passed on in November 2007 to the newly formed charity, The Great Steward of Scotland's Dumfries House Trust.
The Foundation borrowed a considerable proportion of the £45 million total cost, and fundraising is continuing in order to repay this loan. The Foundation also acquired for development some land in the Cumnock area. The redevelopment of this land will be planned by the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment, and it is hoped that this development will also help to repay the loan.
Subsidiaries.
The Foundation has three subsidiary companies, PCF Social Enterprsies Ltd - a holding company for A. G. Carrick Ltd and Duchy Originals Ltd, Prince's Charities Events Ltd, and Golden Jubilee Events Ltd.
Duchy Originals Ltd.
Duchy Originals Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Foundation. It was set up as a company by the Prince of Wales in 1990, and since then Duchy Originals and Duchy Selections have become well known food brands manufactured and sold by many different companies. The Duchy Originals company is paid royalties by the sellers of Duchy Original and Duchy Selections foods.
The turnover of the company, which is the royalty income notified to the company, and which is also the gross profit, came to £4.86 million in 2006/7. Administrative expenses came to £3.31 million giving an operating profit of £1.53 million. Out of this profit a charitable donation of £743,000 was given to the Foundation. One director of the company was paid a salary of £185,000 and also received a pension contribution of £19,000, and the company directors in total received salary and pension contributions of £400,000.
A. G. Carrick Ltd.
A. G. Carrick Ltd exploits intellectual property rights generated by The Prince of Wales and donated to the company as well as running a shop at Highgrove. The company covenants all of its taxable profits to the Foundation.
In 2006/7 A. G. Carrick Ltd had a turnover of £1.1 million but costs of £608,590, which meant that there were profits of just £97,386, which were given to the Foundation as a donation.

Kenny Larkin (who also releases as Dark Comedy) is an American techno producer from Detroit. He has been described by Allmusic as "massively influential" on American, British, and German techno.
Larkin was born and raised in Detroit, but did not participate in the early years of Detroit techno because he was serving in the military. Upon his return, he began producing, influenced by Juan Atkins and Derrick May, as well as the Chicago house music scene. His early single releases, "We Shall Overcome" and "Integration", were issued on Plus 8, a label overseen by Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva; later released appeared on Buzz and Warp as well as other labels. His records have seen more success in continental Europe than in the U.S..
Late in the 1990s, Larkin began working as a stand-up comedian into the 2000s. His musical output has slowed as a result.

The journal was first published in 1955 as a follow-up to Harry S. Truman's 1951 Presidential Task Force on national health concerns and the subsequently written Magnuson Report. This journal aimed to discuss chronic diseases and how they affected all ages, rather than merely the elderly. Furthermore, consistent with the epidemiological transition model, the landscape of the United States' healthcare woes transformed from primarily infectious disease mortality to mortality induced by chronic diseases.

Bacillus (shape)

The word bacillus (plural bacilli) may be used to describe any rod-shaped bacterium, and such bacilli are found in many different taxonomic groups of bacteria. However, the name "Bacillus", capitalized and italicized, refers to a specific genus of bacteria. The name Bacilli, capitalized but not italicized, can also refer to a more specific taxonomic class of bacteria that includes two orders, one of which contains the genus "Bacillus".
Bacilli are usually solitary, but can combine to form diplobacilli, streptobacilli, and palisades. 
There is no connection between the shape of a bacterium and its colors in the Gram staining. MacConkey agar can be used to distinguish among Gram negative bacilli such as "E. coli" and salmonella.

J.W. Mays

J.W. Mays, Inc. () is a real estate firm based in Brooklyn, New York, United States. From 1927 until 1988 the company ran a chain of discount department stores in the area surrounding New York City referred to as simply Mays, with stores located in three of New York City's five boroughs and Long Island.
History.
The chain grew from a Brooklyn women's clothing store founded by Joe Weinstein, a Russian Jewish immigrant, in 1924. In 1927, Weinstein incorporated the company, and added his initials. The reason why he chose the name to begin with was because, as Weinstein said, "it reminded me of the countryside and the flowers and the springtime".
Mays grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Its slogan, "Every Day A Sales Day", was imprinted, in big red, script lettering, on every white paper shopping bag, and every white cardboard shopping box. Mondays were "super-sales" days, and stores were especially crowded then. Weinstein was aggressive in his competition against other discount retailers such as Ohrbach's and Alexander's, as well as the higher--end department stores. At one point, Weinstein discussed a merger between Mays and his two main discount competitors, but it never came to be.
At the company's peak in the 1970s, Mays operated nine stores. At that time, the company had about 5,000 employees. By the late 1970s, it started losing market share to other discount retailers, and in 1982 the store declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company closed five locations that operated outside the city, leaving one store in Manhattan, two stores in Queens, and the original store in Brooklyn.
In 1987, Mays closed one of its two stores in Queens (Glen Oaks), leaving three in the chain. The chain continued on but announced on December 28, 1988 that they would be closing the remaining three stores in the chain immediately, with the final sale occurring on December 31 of that year. Beginning on January 1, 1989, J.W. Mays, Inc. reincorporated as the real estate company that currently does business, using the real estate that its stores had previously occupied.

James A. Johnson (architect)

James Addison Johnson (1865-1939) was a Buffalo, New York architect known for his design of various architectural landmarks and his use of decorative work that many consider a foreshadowing of art deco design.
Johnson was born and educated near Syracuse, New York. Johnson apprenticed and partnered with architects Edward Kent, Joseph Lyman Silsbee, Richard Morris Hunt, James Marling and the firm of McKim, Mead and White in New York City.
Johnson came to Buffalo in 1892 and continue his architectural practice. Significant projects from this period include the Alexander Main Curtiss House designed with partner James Marling.
After Marling's death, Johnson formed a partnership with the German born and trained architect August Esenwein. From its inception in 1897 Esenwein & Johnson was one of the most successful architectural firms of the time and is credited with the design of many buildings that have become Buffalo landmarks. These include the Niagara Mohawk Building, the United Office Building in Niagara Falls, New York, the Ellicott Square Building and various buildings for the Pan-American Exposition notably the Temple of Music (infamous as the site where President William McKinley was assassinated). Esenwein & Johnson designed many buildings for the United Hotels Company, which was the largest hotel chain in the country at the time.
Esenwein & Johnson's work was known for its diverse styles through a sixty year history of designs, executing projects in Georgian Revival, Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles. Of special note is the decorative features of Johnson's design for the 1912 Niagara Mohawk Building which foreshadowed Art Deco ornamentation.
A number of Johnson's Buffalo, New York buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places including The Calumet, Hotel Lafayette, M. Wile and Company Factory Building, Fosdick-Masten Park High School and Lafayette High School.
Johnson died in 1939 in Buffalo, New York.

<doc id="18530099" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18530099" title="USS Viper (1806)">
USS Viper (1806)

USS "Viper" – commissioned as USS "Ferret" – was a brig serving the United States Navy during the early days of the republic. "Viper" was assigned to enforce the Embargo Act of 1807 along the U.S. East Coast. During the War of 1812, while cruising in the Caribbean, she was captured by the more heavily armed British warships. She then served the Royal Navy as HMS "Mohawk" until she was sold in 1814. While in British service she served in several actions that earned her crew the Naval General Service Medal, 
Built in Virginia.
The first ship to be named "Viper" by the Navy, was originally the cutter "Ferret". She was designed by the naval architect Josiah Fox and built at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia, between 1806 and 1809, and was commissioned under her old name on 18 April 1809, Lieutenant Christopher Gadsden, Jr., in command.
Enforcing the Embargo Act of 1807.
Shortly after her commissioning, "Ferret" cruised along the coast of the Carolinas and Georgia to aid in the enforcement of the Embargo Act of 1807. She was renamed "Viper" during re-rigging as a brig at the Washington Navy Yard in 1809 and 1810, and from Washington sailed to New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving there on 18 March 1811. "Viper" remained off the U.S. Gulf Coast enforcing the Embargo Act until the outbreak of the War of 1812. 
Captured during the War of 1812.
During the war, "Viper" proved woefully inadequate in deep water operations against the larger, more heavily gunned British warships. On 17 January 1813 the 32-gun frigate HMS "Narcissus" captured "Viper" off the coast of Belize, British Honduras and took her to New Providence in the Bahama Islands. At the time of her capture "Viper" was armed with 12 guns, had a crew of 93 men and had been cruising for seven weeks off Havana, having made no captures.
British service.
The Royal Navy renamed her "Mohawk" and commissioned her under Commander Henry Dilkes Byng for operations in the Chesapeake.
Battle of Rappahannock River.
"Mohawk" was one of the vessels in the squadron under Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron that contributed boats and men to the cutting out party under Lieutenant J. Puckinghorne that rowed 15 miles up the Rappahannock River on 13 April 1813. The British captured four American privateer schooners: "Dolphin", "Lynx", "Racer" and "Arab". Although the British sustained a number of casualties, "Mohawk" herself sustained no casualties.
The British took three of the schooners into service. "Lynx" became . "Racer" became , and retained her name. It was difficult for the British to free the "Arab" and though they eventually succeeded, the vessel was apparently badly damaged and was not commissioned for British service. She was taken to Halifax where the Vice-Admiralty Court condemned her. 
"Mohawk" was among the vessels benefiting from a number of captures. Announcements of prize money and head-money include:
On 29 April 1813, boats from "Mohawk", together with boats from , "Dolphin" and and "Racer", which had not yet been renamed, went up the Chesapeake Bay to Frenchtown to destroy five American ships and stores; they also purchased provisions for the squadron from the locals. This took until 3 May 1813 to complete. On the way back, a battery fired on the British from the shore; a landing party destroyed the battery. The Admiralty would later issue the clasp "28 April Boat Service 1813" for the Naval General Service Medal to all surviving claimants from the action.
"Mohawk" was among the ships benefiting from the proceeds of the capture of the American ships "Rolla" (29 May) and "Protectress" (18 June). She was also among the vessels benefiting from the capture of the Spanish brig "St. Iago" (11 June 1813), the American schooner "Surveyor" (12 June), the American ships "Governor Strong" and "Emily" (12 June), "Star" (14 June), and "Herman" (21 June).
On 14 July 1813 the brigs and "Mohawk" spotted the American schooner USS "Asp" and the "Scorpion" and immediately gave chase. "Scorpion" made good her escape up the Chesapeake, but Asp's poor sailing qualities forced her to put back into the Yeocomico River. "Contest" and "Mohawk" anchored off the bar and prepared a boat expedition.
"Contest"s cutter, under the command of Lieutenant Curry, and "Mohawk"s cutter, under the command of Lieutenant Hutchinson, followed "Asp" three or four miles up the Yeocomico. "Asp" was armed with one long 18-pounder gun and two 18-pounder carronades, together with some swivels. She had a crew of 20 men under the command of Midshipman Sigourney.
As the British boats approached, "Asp" cut her cable and tried to escape further up the river. The American account states that three British boats attacked but were beaten off. Then two other British boats joined the first three for a second attempt, which proved successful. The Americans fought valiantly in spite of the lopsided odds. Midshipman Sigourney and ten of his 20-man crew were killed defending their ship while the remainder escaped ashore when the issue became hopeless. 
Despite fire from "Asp" and from militia on the shore, the British captured "Asp" within a short time, but at a cost of two men killed and six wounded, including Lieutenant Curry (slightly). The British set fire to "Asp" and retired. At that point, "Asp"s second in command, Midshipman H. McClintock, led the remnants of "Asp"s crew back on board, extinguished the flames, and put her back in fighting trim. For whatever reason, the British declined to renew the combat.
Fate.
Commander Henry Litchfield assumed command in July 1813. "Mohawk" was sold in 1814.

Honorary Sabre

The Honorary Sabre is one of the highest military awards for bravery in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Only knights of the Military William Order are eligible to receive this sabre. The queen awards this highly decorated sabre to a military officer who will wear this together with his uniform.
History of the Honorary Sabre.
The Netherlands had honorary sabres of equivalent for centuries. During the Dutch Republic, the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland such sabres already existed, and were awarded by grateful subordinates to their officer, or were awarded by a government, city, or ruler to a military officer.
Sabres awarded by military officers and soldiers to their commanders during the Ten days campaign didn't have an official status yet.
The honorary sabres made in 1855 were destined primarily for officers of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army who already were knighted in the Military William Order and again showed deeds of exceptional bravery.
After the royal decree in 1865 Honorary Sabres were also awarded to officers of the Royal Netherlands Army and the Schutterij.
An honorary sabre was always a nicely decorated workmanship of the weapon and its hilt; the scabbard and blade were decorated and engraved, and the material of the sword was gold and silver, or during more difficult times made of cheaper Nickel silver, horn and gold-plated copper.
Shape of the Honorary Sabre.
During the history several types of the sabre existed:
The Dutch kings or queens awarded in total 106 Honorary Sabres in the Dutch East Indies. The last sabre awarded to a Dutch officer was in 1911 to First Lieutenant of the Royal Marines H.J.Schmidt. General Eisenhower was the last person to be awarded with this honour.

Dangpa

Dangpa is the Korean name for a three-pronged spear first described in the Muyejebo, a 16th-century martial arts manual from the Joseon Dynasty. 
Types.
There were several types of "dangpa", like the iron "dang pa", called "cheolpa" (철파, 鐵鈀) and the wooden "dangpa", called "mokpa" (목파, 木鈀). The two outer teeth of the "cheolpa" would be slightly crooked. The teeth of the "mokpa" were made of wood, but covered with iron. 
The middle tip would always be slightly longer than the two other tips. This design was intended to lessen the chance of the weapon becoming stuck in an opponent's body.
At the other end of the pole would be a sharp tip as well, in the event that two-handed combat with the dangpa became necessary in battle - this way soldiers fighting with the dangpa had fighting edges on both ends of the weapon.
Techniques.
In the Muyedobotongji one set of techniques is given. This form of 22 movements is called "dangpa chongbo" (당파총보, 鐺鈀總譜) accompanied by a diagram to explain the same form called "dangpa chongdo" (당파총도, 鐺鈀總圖).

The Man Who Broke Britain

The Man Who Broke Britain is a 2004 BBC Television docudrama about a financial collapse triggered by a devastating terrorist strike.
Plot.
A devastating terrorist strike wipes out much of Saudi Arabia's oil production; the same day a trader of Saudi origin disappears from the fictional UK investment bank Sun First Credit (SFCB). Managers soon discover the missing trader, Samir Badr, has built up crippling debts, multiplied a hundredfold by the attacks in Saudi. SFCB, once the toast of the city, is suddenly heading for bankruptcy, taking a whole raft of other banks with it. The resulting market crash and banking crisis will push Britain and the US into a 21st Century recession: pension funds are slashed, unemployment soars and the housing market collapses. Following the discovery that Badr has committed suicide, a new Al-Qa'eda tape surfaces, in which Osama Bin Laden appears to claim responsibility for the financial turmoil. Suspicion grows that Badr was an Islamic extremist who deliberately sabotaged the bank. As the authorities and the media launch a massive investigation into the apparent Al-Qaeda assault on the pillars of the Western Economy, an alternative explanation emerges. Could greed and incompetence be the real cause of the collapse of Britain's economy?

Art Gallery of Hamilton

Art Gallery of Hamilton, is located in the heart of downtown Hamilton, Ontario on King Street West. One of the oldest public art galleries in Canada and the third largest with a collection of over 10,000 works of art seeing close to 290'000 visitors a year.
History.
Artist William Blair Bruce, born and raised in Hamilton and successful internationally, died suddenly in 1906. In 1914, his family, including his widow, sculptor Caroline Benedicts-Bruce bequeathed 29 of his paintings to the city of Hamilton, with the understanding that a properly equipped art gallery be established to house and present the collection.
Today, the William Blair Bruce memorial donation is displayed in a dramatic salon-style hanging in what is the Art Gallery of Hamilton’s third home.
From 1914 until 1953, the Gallery’s first home was the second floor of the Hamilton Public Library building located on Main Street West near James Street.
In 1947, the Gallery was a founding member of the Southern Ontario Gallery Group, now the Ontario Association of Art Galleries.
In December 1953, a new purpose-built gallery was opened at "Forsyth Avenue" and Main Street in west Hamilton. A little over a decade later, McMaster University unveiled plans to expropriate the lands on which the Gallery was built, halting plans to expand the Gallery in this location.
In 1977, the Gallery opened in its present location in the heart of the city as part of a downtown redevelopment project.
In 2005, a renovated Gallery reopened, with new gold-coloured steel cladding protecting the building, a glass-enclosed front entrance on King Street, a new multi-purpose pavilion, and larger and renovated exhibition spaces.
Collection highlights.
The AGH primary collection is based on Canadian historical, Canadian contemporary and European historical art. Each year, the Gallery organizes, hosts and/or circulates approximately 25-30 exhibitions throughout the world.
The Art Gallery of Hamilton’s collection of modern Canadian art is one of the strongest in the country, due, in no small part to the vision and efforts of Thomas Reid (T.R.) MacDonald (1908–1978), the Gallery’s first full-time director and curator. 
MacDonald soon inaugurated the Annual Winter Exhibition at the Gallery; this yearly exhibition was held from 1948-1973. These juried exhibitions provided artists with an important exhibition venue and also brought works to Hamilton that might be acquired by the Gallery.
Usually about one hundred works were featured in each exhibition, with the purchase prize (generally donated by a local patron or business) entering the AGH permanent collection. In this way, many important works were acquired, such as A.J. Casson’s "First Snow", Lilias Torrance Newton’s "Keith MacIver", and the iconic "Horse and Train" by Alex Colville.
Selected as the purchase prize in 1954, "Horse and Train" was panned by The Hamilton Spectator art critic Mary Mason, who wrote: “There are undoubtedly some very fine paintings out at the Art Gallery of Hamilton in this year’s Winter Show, but the winner of the purchase prize is not, alas, one of them.”

The Nelsonian

The Nelsonian is a 32-piece One-Man Band contraption, that Albert Nelson (1884-1964) designed, built and played. Nelson began building the device in 1915, because the Cello player in his band would often fail to show up. This led him to invent a device, that would allow him to play the Violin and Cello at the same time. His work on the machine concluded in 1957, when he added the 32nd and final instrument. The Nelsonian was a featured exhibit at Ripley's Believe it Or Not Odditorium during the 1933 World Fair in Chicago, Illinois.
Albert Nelson was born November 14, 1884. He grew up in Sacred Heart, Minnesota. Albert was the youngest of the 14 children. As a child, Albert was interested in music. Albert could play Violin by age 7. He took piano and violin lessons during his childhood. By age fourteen he could play fourteen different instruments.
As an adult, Albert learned photography from his brother and started his own studio in Wheaton, Minnesota. Albert married Jennie Erickson of Evansville, Minnesota on May 29, 1912 when Albert was 28 years old and they ran the photography studio together. Albert worked more and more away from home working on putting more instruments into his band that Jennie and Albert separated.
Albert left and moved to Buffalo, Minnesota and started another photography studio. He still experimented with his instruments and started performing at lodges, resorts and fairs. A couple years later he married Ida Nelson. On October 27, 1925 Albert’s parent’s house burned down, and on December 3, his mother died.
In February 1962 Ida died. Albert was almost 80 years old he was four months and ten days away when he died. There was a memorial service held for albert in Tampa, Florida on Sunday July 5, 1964 prior to his funeral in Buffalo, Minnesota a fitting eulogy was read for him.
The Nelsonian is on permanent display in the Wright County Heritage Center, located at Buffalo, Minnesota. The truck which Nelson used to transport the device, has recently been restored by the museum staff.
Gary Hukriede, grand-nephew of Albert Nelson, has published a 138-page book entitled, "The Mighty Nelsonian: The story of Albert Nelson and his 32-piece One-Man-Band". Hukriede has also compiled a 2-disc CD of original Nelsonian recordings.
The Nelsonian traveled to the 1933 World’s Fair in Chicago. The fair attracted more than 27 million people. At the World’s Fair, the Nelsonian was a feature of Ripley’s Believe It or Not “Odditorium.” According to his five-month contract, Albert played the Nelsonian every hour the fair was open to the public and received $40 per week.
In April 1936 Albert Nelson received a personal invitation letter from Jay Gould to join his Million Dollar Circus. He called it the Million Dollar circus because he said his kids were worth more than a million dollars. The circus traveled the Midwest and made stops in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin and occasionally Nebraska and Indiana.
Maynard Howe remembered the Nelsonian “ Was mounted on a truck, which served as a big stage at one end of the tent, which was set up over and around it. The walls on the sides and back of the truck, which protected the instruments from weather when moving it from place to place, were removable, and when taken down apposed to spectators three size of the Nelsonian. Inside the tent there were no seats. A person buying a ticket can remain as long as they desired and could walk around and watch...and operator and the many moving parts create music.”
After the Nelsons moved to Florida in 1949, the Nelsonian continued to tour during the summer months. Albert spent the winter cleaning the instrument and making improvements. Albert continued performing on the road with the Nelsonian until 1959. Ida died in February 1962; Albert lost interest in the Nelsonian. Albert died July 4, 1964.

Breathing Space are a band formed in 2006 by Mostly Autumn keyboardist Iain Jennings. Some of the members had played on his solo album and formed a band to tour this record. They became a full-time band in 2007 when they released their first album as a band. This was called "Coming Up for Air".
Mark Rowen left the band in early 2009 and was replaced by Mostly Autumn guitarist Liam Davison, but he was then in turn replaced by Bryan Josh after playing only three live shows with the band. Bryan's appointment was only temporary and the band placed an advertisement in "Classic Rock Magazine" in an attempt to find a permanent replacement.
During Liam's stint with the band, they recorded their second album as a whole band which is titled "Below the Radar". This was released in August 2009, with a special pre-release run of 100 copies selling out at the Cambridge Rock Festival.
It was announced in January 2010 that both Olivia Sparnenn and Bryan Josh would be leaving the band to concentrate on Mostly Autumn after the departure of lead vocalist Heather Findlay.
In July 2010, Heidi Widdop and Adam Dawson were announced as new members of the band. This new line up of the band debuted at the Cambridge Rock Festival in August 2010, and played a new song 'My Lips are too Dry'. Another new song, 'Unnatural Disaster', was played at later shows. However this new line up of the band was short-lived as after only a handful of gigs, Breathing Space decided to disband in January 2011. Heidi Widdop, Adam Dawson, Paul Teasdale and Barry Cassells, all members of the final incarnation of Breathing Space, formed a new band called Stolen Earth later that year.

Calatrava la Vieja

Calatrava la Vieja (formerly just "Calatrava") is a medieval site and original nucleus of the Order of Calatrava. It is now part of the Archaeological Parks ("Parques Arqueológicos") of the Community of Castile-La Mancha. Situated at "Carrión de Calatrava", Calatrava during the High Middle Ages was the only important city in the Guadiana River valley. It thus guarded the roads to Cordova and Toledo.
Its name is derived from the Arabic "Qal'at Rabāḥ" قلعة رباح ("fortress of Rabah"), a reference to the Moorish nobleman who held this area in the 8th century, although as a fortress it may date even earlier – to Iberian times.
References to the site date from as early as 785, and in 853 owing to conflicts between the Muslims of Toledo and the emirate of Cordova, it was partially destroyed, but rebuilt later. The site was rebuilt under al-Hakam, brother of Muhammad I. It became the capital of the region. At the fall of the Caliphate of Cordova, the Taifa kingdoms or republics of Seville, Cordova, and Toledo competed to acquire Calatrava.
Toledo was conquered by Alfonso VI of Castile in 1085, and the Almoravids arrived in the Iberian Peninsula a year later. In 1147, Calatrava was conquered by Alfonso VII, becoming one of the farthest Christian outposts during this stage of the "reconquista".
The castle was placed under the protection of the Knights Templar, but this proved unsatisfactory, and Sancho III of Castile made an offer: he would grant the town and fortress of Calatrava to anyone who promised to defend it from the Moors. Encouraged by a friar named Diego Velásquez, who had been a warrior before becoming a friar, Saint Raymond of Fitero took up the challenge. Sancho granted them the privilege of defending Calatrava, and Raymond organized an army, with the support of Juan II of Toledo, the Archbishop of Toledo, that successfully prevented the Moors from attacking this place in 1158.
As a result of this success, Raymond decided to found the Order of Calatrava, organized along Cistercian lines.
The city was reconquered by the Almohads in 1195, after their victory against Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Alarcos. They held it for 17 years, until 1212, when it was recovered as part of the campaign that resulted in the decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa: after conquering Calatrava, there were some disagreements among the members of the Christian coalition: French and other European knights were not used to the summer heat, but more importantly, they did not agree with Alfonso VIII´s order of humane treatment of Jews and Muslims. Previously, they had created problems in Toledo, (where the different armies of the Crusade gathered), with assaults and murders in the Jewish Quarter. So, more than 30,000 men deserted and crossed back over the Pyrenees.
In 1217, the Order of Calatrava moved to Calatrava la Nueva (castle of Dueñas), 60 km to the south. Thus, the original site became known as "Calatrava la Vieja" ("Old Calatrava").
Calatrava la Vieja remained the center of the royal land grant, but it was completely abandoned by the early fifteenth century, when the Knight Commander of Calatrava moved his residence to Carrión de Calatrava.

John has published peer reviewed journal articles on the topics of scrupulosity (religious or moral OCD), trichotillomania (hair pulling), and is currently authoring several articles on the LDS/LGBT experience. John is also the creator of several Mormon-themed podcasts, blogs and web sites. John worked for several years in various positions at Microsoft, and served for a few years as the Director of the OpenCourseWare Consortium for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Biographical background.
Dehlin was born in Boise, Idaho and raised in Katy, Texas. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), he served as a missionary in Guatemala in the late 1980s. He then attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1993.
After graduation, Dehlin worked for five years in software and as a consultant for Bain & Company, Arthur Andersen, Citicorp, Heidrick & Struggles, and the LDS Church. He then worked at Microsoft for seven years in programs for developers, marketing, speech technologies, and product demos.
Dehlin's brother, Joel Dehlin, also worked at Microsoft, and became the CIO of the LDS Church in 2004.
In 2004, Dehlin moved to Logan, Utah to begin work under Dr. David A. Wiley at Utah State University (USU) on OpenCourseWare-related projects. Dehlin would serve as USU's OpenCourseWare Consortium Coordinator and Director of Outreach for the Center for Open and Sustainable Learning Director of Outreach for two years, where he promoted OpenCourseWare to other universities. While at USU, Dehlin also completed a Master of Science degree in Instructional Technology in 2007. In January 2007, MIT hired Dehlin as the Director of the OpenCourseWare Consortium.
John is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical and Counseling Psychology at Utah State University.
Crises of faith.
As an LDS missionary in Guatemala from 1988 - 1990, Dehlin's mission began baptizing up to 700 "converts" per month. To accomplish this, many missionaries were using deceptive methods which were taught and supported by some mission leaders. Dehlin was disturbed and reported these activities to his mission president who did not share Dehlin's concern and sent him home early (normally a disciplinary action). After reporting on this to a sympathetic Apostle Dallin H. Oaks and completing his two-year missionary term in the Arizona Tempe mission, Dehlin remained an active, faithful member of the LDS Church for the next 20 years, but began to study church administration, history, doctrine and theology more in depth.
While living in the Seattle area, Dehlin was called to be an early-morning LDS Seminary teacher. In preparation for the next year's class, he began studying LDS Church history in greater depth which led to his discovery of several controversial issues such as Joseph Smith's practice of polyandry, DNA and archeological issues with the Book of Mormon, etc. With shaken faith, he didn't find many informed or sympathetic local church members and therefore contemplated leaving the church. On the Internet he found communities antagonistic toward the LDS Church which didn't encourage him to stay either. Eventually he discovered publications such as "" and "Sunstone Magazine" which acknowledged LDS controversies but provided thoughtful responses/solutions to the problems. These resources helped Dehlin decide to stay in the church for several years after his initial discoveries.
In 2011 Dehlin reported going "inactive" from the LDS Church for a period of months, citing an inability to believe some of the church's fundamental truth claims. After being exonerated from a series of investigations into his Internet activities (led by his LDS bishop and stake president), Dehlin has returned to the LDS Church as an active member.
Sunstone.
Finding limited internet presence for constructive Mormon intellectual sources, Dehlin approached the Sunstone Education Foundation and presented to its Board of Directors about the importance of participating in developing internet communities through blogging and podcasting. The Board accepted his offer to initiate these programs and, in September 2005, Dehlin joined the Board of Directors and began a Sunstone podcast as well as "SunstoneBlog". In July 2007, he also became executive director of the Sunstone Education Foundation, in which he was to focus on strategic initiatives to strengthen Sunstone's position as an open forum for Mormon issues. In that role, he tried to increase the organizational focus on its longstanding motto, "faith seeking understanding", and to attract new and younger membership. Dehlin resigned from Sunstone in January 2008.
"Mormon Stories".
In September 2005, after finding reasons to stay a member of the LDS Church, Dehlin created the "Mormon Stories" podcast as an open discussion of Mormon issues with the intention of giving listeners reasons to remain in the church. Through interviews, Mormon Stories focused on varying Mormon experiences and perspectives, including antagonistic, apologetic, intellectual, gay, black, fundamentalist, feminist, and dissenting. Several notable Mormon figures were guests on "Mormon Stories", including Gregory Prince, Todd Compton, Grant Palmer, Darius Gray, Margaret Blair Young, Richard Bushman, and Margaret and Paul Toscano. To date, listenership at times exceeds 25,000 downloads per episode. Mormon Stories has been featured in many venues, including being broadcast on KVNU in Logan, Utah. In June 2007 John Dehlin was quoted for stories by The New York Times and Good Morning America, discussing Mitt Romney and Mormonism.
At times personally conflicted about continuing "Mormon Stories", Dehlin stopped and restarted the project a few times. In January 2010 Dehlin resumed the blog and podcast, focusing on faith crises, mental illnesses, and notable guests, beginning with interviews of Joanna Brooks and John Hamer. Two other regular hosts joined Dehlin in conducting interviews for the podcast: Dan Wotherspoon, former editor of "Sunstone" magazine; and Natasha Helfer Parker, a licensed clinical marriage and family therapist.
Other blogs.
In June 2007, Dehlin started "Mormon Matters" as a blog and weekly podcast, with the intention of eventually becoming a radio show. The format was a discussion panel on events, culture, politics and spirituality within Mormonism. Panelists were to represent different sides of each issue, although the show later struggled to retain regular conservative LDS panelists. In early 2008, Dehlin converted "Mormon Matters" into a group blog and lessened emphasis on new podcast episodes. Dehlin resumed the Mormon Matters podcast on March 5, 2011 with Dan Wotherspoon as the host, and Joanna Brooks as a frequent co-host.
Dehlin is also the co-founder of the Mormons for Marriage website (a pro-gay marriage site) and "Stay LDS", a community dedicated to helping unorthodox Mormons stay in the LDS church if that is their desire.

Aguilar v. Felton

Aguilar v. Felton, , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that New York City's program that sent public school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education to disadvantaged children pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 necessitated an excessive entanglement of church and state and violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
"Aguilar v. Felton" was subsequently overruled by "Agostini v. Felton", 521 U.S. 203 (1997).

<doc id="18530427" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18530427" title="Alusi">
Alusi

Alusi, also known as Arusi or Arushi, are deities that are worshiped and served in the religion of the Igbo people (an ethnic group of southeastern Nigeria). There are a list of many different Alusi and each has its own purpose. When there is no longer need for the deity it is discarded.
Ancestors.
The Igbo world is divided into several interconnected realms, principal among them being the realm of the living, the realm of the dead or of the ancestors, and the realm of the unborn. Individuals who led an honorable life and received a proper burial proceeded to the ancestral realm to take their place among the ancestors or Ndichie, who are not the same as the Alusi. From there they kept a watchful eye on the clan and visited their loved ones among the living with blessings such as fertility, good health, longevity and prosperity. In gratitude the living offered sacrifices to them at the family hearth, and sought their counsel.
Alusi worship.
Each major deity had a priest in every town that honored it, and the priest was assisted by a group of acolytes and devotees.
Children and Alusi.
Children are still considered the greatest blessing of all and this is reflected in popular names such as Nwakaego; a child is worth more than money or Arawakan; no wealth is worthier than a child, or Nwabuugwu; a child is the greatest honor. In a small part of Igboland(Imo and Abia states- Mba-area), women who successfully deliver ten children are rewarded with special celebrations and rites that honor their hips. Infertility is considered a particularly harsh misfortune. The Igbo believe that it is children who perpetuate the race, and in order to do so children are expected to continue Igbo tradition and ways. Parts of Igbo divinities is Agwu Alusi, the god of health and divination. Agwu is a concept used by the Igbo to explain and understand: good and evil, health and sickness, and poverty and fortune and misfortune.
List of Alusi.
Deities or Alusi include Ahia Njoku, the goddess of yams, and Amadioha (or Amadiora) the god of thunder and lightning. In addition to them there are:

The Stone Dogs

The Stone Dogs (1990) by S. M. Stirling is the third book in the alternate history series, The Domination. "The Stone Dogs" details the life of Eric von Shrakenberg's niece, Yolande Ingolfsson, and Chantal Lefarge's children, Frederick and Marya. Eric later becomes the Archon during the "Final War."
Plot summary.
During the cold war between the Alliance and the Domination, Frederic and Marya work for the OSS as spies and assassins. 
During the Draka conquest of India, Marya Lefarge is taken prisoner. She becomes a serf to Yolande Ingolfsson, who after torturing her repeatedly with a neural weapon, forces her to become a "brooder" (i.e. a surrogate mother) for her offspring, Gwendolyn. Yolande also swears vengeance on Fred Lefarge after he kills her lover, Myfanwy Venders, during the Indian Incident.
As both superpowers expand into space, they prepare different doomsday weapons. The Alliance's weapon is a computer virus ("comp plague") secretly planted in Draka military computers by spies; the Draka's is a biological virus called the Stone Dogs that causes infected personnel to go insane. Yolande discovers Marya, who has contacted the OSS, planting the comp-plague and allows her to escape with knowledge of the Stone Dogs. This forces her uncle, Archon Eric von Shrakenberg, to use the weapon prematurely. The Draka win the resulting conflict; however, their incomplete victory leads to Eric negotiating an arrangement whereupon the Alliance is allowed to launch its generation ship "The New America" and the remaining Alliance survivors in space are granted limited Draka citizenship.

19th Operations Group

The 19th Operations Group (19 OG) is the operational flying component of the United States Air Force 19th Airlift Wing, stationed at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas.
Equipped with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the group provides part of Air Mobility Command's Global Reach capability. Tasking requirements range from supplying humanitarian airlift relief to victims of disasters, to airdropping supplies and troops into the heart of contingency operations in hostile areas.
The 19 OG is one of the oldest organizations in the Air Force, being a successor organization of the 19th Bombardment Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II.
As part of the Far East Air Force, the unit was stationed at Clark Field in the Philippines when the Japanese attacked on 8 December 1941, suffering numerous casualties and losing most of its Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses in the attack. A small number of its aircraft escaped to fly combat missions in the Philippines; Netherlands East Indies and Papua New Guinea during early 1942.
In March 1942, the group was re-established in Australia, as part of the Fifth Air Force. From far-flung bases in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, the group carried out missions over Japanese-held areas in New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies.
After moving to Guam in 1944, the group was re-equipped with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and conducted its first raid with B-29s on 25 February 1945, against Tokyo.
The group has earned the distinction of being one of the most decorated units in the Air Force. Unit honors include nine Presidential Unit Citations, two Air Force Meritorious Unit Awards, ten Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards, one Philippine Presidential Unit Citation, and one Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.
Units.
The 19th Operations Group is composed of seven flying squadrons, flying the Lockheed C-130 Hercules:
Heraldry.
The group's emblem, approved in 1936, shows a winged sword in front of the constellation of Pegasus, indicating both the striking force and navigation capability of the unit.
History.
The 19th Observation Group was constituted as part of the United States Army Air Corps on 18 October 1927, without personnel or equipment. In 1929 its paper designation was changed to the 19th Bombardment Group, and it came into being with its activation at Rockwell Field, California, in June 1932. Two of its four squadrons, the 23rd and 72nd Bomb Squadrons, were permanently detached for service in Hawaii with the 5th Composite Group. The two squadrons at Rockwell, the 30th and 32nd Bomb Squadrons, were equipped with Keystone B-3A bombers.
The unit flew training missions along the California coast for coastal defense between 1932 and 1935. On 1 March 1935, all aviation combat units of the AAC in the United States were reorganized into General Headquarters Air Force, the first centralized control of the air striking arm of the United States. The 19th BG moved to March Field, California as part of the 1st Wing, commanded by Brig. Gen. Henry H. Arnold.
In 1940, the group was equipped with the new B-17B Flying Fortress, the first production version of the B-17. The unit made aviation history on the night of 13–14 May 1941 when they took 21 B-17s from California to Hawaii to transfer them to the 11th Bomb Group, landing on schedule within 30 minutes of each other and in the order they took off. The 19th BG redeployed two squadrons (the 30th and 93d) to the Philippines between 16 October and 4 November 1941. The 26 bombers, traveling individually and at night on their longest leg, flew a trans-Pacific route from Hamilton Field, California; to Hickam Field, Hawaii; Midway Island; Wake Island; Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and Clark Field, Luzon, a distance of over 10,000 miles, nearly all of it over water. The route had been pioneered between 5 and 12 September 1941 by the 14th Bombardment Squadron, which was attached as the group's third squadron after its arrival. The 28th Bombardment Squadron, a squadron that had long been based in the Philippines with the 4th Composite Group (being broken up and disbanded), but now rostered by pilots fresh out of flight training, was also attached to the group as its fourth squadron and began transition training to the B-17. The 19th BG had an inventory of 6 B-17C and 29 B-17D, although one B-17D was out of commission during its entire overseas service when it broke off its tail in a collision with a parked aircraft while landing after its flight from the United States on 12 September.
World War II.
B-17 Flying Fortress era.
The unit was stationed at Clark Field as the bomber command of the Far East Air Force when the Japanese attacked on 8 December 1941, inflicting numerous casualties and destroying half of its aircraft in the attack. The 14th and 93d Squadrons, 14 B-17D and two B-17C bombers, had been ordered to Del Monte Airfield on Mindanao just prior to the bombing of Clark Field, and escaped unharmed.
During December 1941, the 19th began reconnaissance and bombardment operations against Japanese shipping and landing parties until 17 December when badly in need of depot maintenance, it began displacing south to Darwin. By the end of the year, ground personnel joined infantry units defending the Philippines, while the air echelon in Australia continued operations, including transport of supplies to the Philippines and evacuation of personnel. On 29 December 11 of the survivors moved forward to Singosari Airfield near Malang, Java, to continue combat operations.
The group flew B-17s, B-24s, and LB-30s from Java against enemy airfields, shipping, and ground installations during the Japanese offensive against the Netherlands East Indies during early 1942, and was again evacuated on 2 March to Australia. It participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, in May 1942, and raided enemy transportation and communications targets as well as troop concentrations during the Japanese invasion of Papua New Guinea. The group bombed enemy airdromes, ground installations, and shipping near Rabaul, New Britain in August 1942. Capt. Harl Pease, who had been with the group since the start of the war, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for a mission flown on 7 August 1942.
By late 1942, the USAAF decided that no more B-17s would be sent to the Pacific, and that units would be withdrawn or re-equipped in the Pacific in favor of the longer-ranged B-24 Liberator. In addition, the combat losses by Eighth Air Force in Europe were reaching such magnitudes that the entire B-17 production was urgently needed for replacements and training in that theater. The 19th Bomb Group was withdrawn from Australia and returned to Pocatello Army Air Base, Idaho in December to be a replacement training organization for II Bomber Command. However, weather in the northwestern United States was not conducive to training missions, and the 19th was moved to Pyote Army Airfield, Texas in January where it performed a training mission until November 1943.
B-29 Superfortress era.
The group was largely unmanned from December 1943 to 1 April 1944, when it was inactivated. The group was activated the same date at Great Bend Army Airfield in Kansas, at the 19th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) and began training for B-29 Superfortress combat missions. Delays in B-29 production and many modifications to the new aircraft led to extensive delays in the group's training. Construction of the B-29 airfields in the Marianas chain of islands, consisting primarily of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, also delayed deployment to the Pacific until the group was ordered to the massive new North Field on Guam on 16 January 1945. On Guam the 19th was assigned to the 314th Bombardment Wing, XXI Bomber Command, Twentieth Air Force. The group's aircraft were identified with a large 96-inch black box on the tail fin, with a "M" painted in the middle.
After some familiarity and training missions, the 19th conducted its first B-29 bombing raid over Japan on 25 February 1945, attacking Northeast Tokyo on a high-altitude bombing mission. The bombing results, however were poor. Over Japan, the B-29s encountered the jet stream, which was a high-speed wind coming out of the west at speeds as high as 200 mph at precisely the altitudes at which the bombers were operating. This caused the bomber formations to be disrupted and made accurate bombing impossible. Other targets in Japan were attacked and the results were still disappointing. Only ten percent of the damage done by the bombs was actually inside the target areas, and numerous were lost in these raids, many to accidents caused by engine failures due to the stress of flying in the jet stream.
Concerned about the relative failure of the B-29 offensive to deal any crippling blows to Japan, General LeMay issued a new directive on 19 February. General LeMay had analyzed the structure of the Japanese economy, which depended heavily on cottage industries housed in cities close to major industrial areas. By destroying these feeder industries, the flow of vital components to the central plants could be slowed, disorganizing production of weapons vital to Japan. He decided to do this by using incendiary bombs rather than purely high-explosive bombs, which would, it was hoped, cause general conflagrations in large cities like Tokyo or Nagoya, spreading to some of the priority targets.
The first raid to use these new techniques was on the night of 9–10 March against Tokyo. Another wing--the 314th Bombardment Wing (19th, 29th, 39th, and 330th BG) commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas S. Power--had arrived in the Marianas and was stationed at North Field on Guam. A total of 302 B-29s participated in the raid, with 279 arriving over the target. The raid was led by special pathfinder crews who marked central aiming points. It lasted for two hours. The raid was a success beyond General LeMay's wildest expectations. The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration known as a firestorm. When it was over, sixteen square miles of the center of Tokyo had gone up in flames and nearly 84,000 people had been killed. Fourteen B-29s were lost. The B-29 was finally beginning to have an effect.
By 20 March, XXI Bombardment Corps had run out of incendiaries, forcing a momentary pause. While waiting for new incendiary stocks, LeMay devoted his B-29s to flying tactical missions over the island of Kyushu in support of the invasion of Okinawa. Airfields and support facilities were primary targets. These raids lasted until early May.
By the end of the war in August 1945, the 195h Bombardment group flew 65 raids on the Japanese home islands, bombing strategic targets in Japan, participating in incendiary bomb attacks against Japanese cities, and attacked kamikaze airfields during the invasion of Okinawa in the spring of 1945.
Post/Cold War.
In the late 1940s, the 19th conducted sea-search, photographic mapping, and training missions in the western Pacific. It was the only Bombardment Group not in the Strategic Air Command chain of command and, in 1950, the only Bombardment Group permanently stationed outside the continental limits of the United States.
When the Korean War broke out in late June 1950, the 19th Bombardment Group was immediately detached from the Wing for combat operations from Kadena AB, Okinawa. From Kadena, the squadrons (28th, 30th 93d) attacked North Korean invasion forces. The first B-29 Superfortress unit in the war, the group on 28 June attacked North Korean storage tanks, marshalling yards, and armor in the vicinity of Seoul, South Korea. This was the first of just under 650 combat missions during the course of the war. In the first two months of the war, it flew more than six hundred sorties, supporting UN ground forces by bombing enemy troops, vehicles, and such communications points as the Han River bridges.
At Kadena, the group was initially under the operational control of Twentieth Air Force, after 8 July 1950, it was attached to FEAF Bomber Command (Provisional). Many of the aircraft flown by the 19th Bomb Group squadrons in combat were refurbished B-29s that were placed in storage after World War II, then brought back into operational service.
In the north, its targets included an oil refinery and port facilities at Wonsan, a railroad bridge at Pyongyang, and Yonpo Airfield. After United Nations ground forces pushed the communists out of South Korea, the 19th BG turned to strategic objectives in North Korea, including industrial and hydroelectric facilities. It also continued to attack bridges, marshalling yards, supply centers, artillery and troop positions, barracks, port facilities, and airfields.
In accordance with organizational change within the Strategic Air Command and later throughout the entire Air Force, the 19th Bomb Group was inactivated on 1 June 1953 and its squadrons assigned directly to the 19th Bomb Wing as part of the Tri-Deputate organization of the wing, which moved its headquarters to Kadena. In combat over the skies of Korea, there were at least 33 reported aircraft losses in the 19th Bomb Group.
Modern era.
Reactivated in 1991 as the 19 Operations Group when the 19 Air Refueling Wing implemented the Objective Wing organization.
From January 1992, it provided an EC-137 and crews to support the United States Special Operations Command, and from August 1992 the wing supported the Saudi Tanker Task Force. It provided air refueling support to NATO fighters in Bosnia in September–October 1995. Several KC-135R tankers deployed to Southwest Asia to support Operation Southern Watch, January–March 1996 and to Turkey for Operation Provide Comfort, April–June 1996.
On 1 July 1996, the 19th Air Refueling Wing was inactivated, and its functions turned over to its operations group, redesignated the 19th Air Refueling Group. The 19th ARG consists of four squadrons: 19th Operations Support Squadron (OSS), 19th Maintenance Squadron (MXS), 19th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS), and the 99th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS).
The Black Knights returned to Istres, France, in August 1996 deploying five aircraft and 125 personnel in support of Operation Deny Flight. In December, the group received an inspection from the Air Mobility Command's Quality Air Force Assessment Team. During the inspection, the team found the 19th's leadership, support, and maintenance to be among the best in Air Mobility Command.
Black Knight aircraft and personnel deployed to numerous contingency operations and exercises during 1997 and continued the group's record for success. 1998 proved to be another banner year for the 19th. Most notably, the Black Knights supported Operation Northern Watch, enforcing the United Nation's no-fly zone in northern Iraq; Operation Desert Thunder, US action against Iraqi aggression; and Operation Constant Vigil, US antidrug operations in the Caribbean. The 99th Air Refueling Squadron was named the Air Force Association's Citation of Honor winner for the unit that contributed most to national defense during 1998. Additionally, the 99th won the coveted General Carl A. Spaatz Trophy for 1998—given annually to the "Best Air Refueling Squadron in the US Air Force."
The 19th was off to another record start in 1999 when it earned a rare, perfect "Outstanding" during its Headquarters, Air Mobility Command Operational Readiness Inspection. Additionally, the 19th had just returned from supporting Operation Deliberate Forge and Operation Allied Force, US support for the NATO's Air War over the Former Republic of Yugoslavia -having deployed over three-fourths of its personnel and aircraft to four forward operating locations throughout Europe.
21st Century.
Even after the war, the new millennium brought the 19th many new challenges. The Black Knights, although the last home, were the first to reconstitute its forces and prepare for its role as the first on-call expeditionary force for the Air Force's newest Expeditionary Aerospace Force concept. Furthermore, the recognition continued as the 19th received the AMC nomination for USSTRATCOM's Omaha Trophy for DoD's unit that best supported the Single Integrated Operational Plan. Also, the 99 ARS repeated its role as it won the 1999 Spaatz Trophy as well as the AMC nomination for the Citation of Honor Award; the 19 OSS earned the honors of the Best OSS in Twenty-First Air Force; and the 19 AGS not only received the Twenty-First Air Force Maintenance Effectiveness Award, but also dominated the 2000 Rodeo Competition as it brought home the "Best KC-135 Maintenance" Trophy. The current 19th Operations Group Commander is Colonel David A. Kasberg.
19th Air Refueling Group.
The group's last designation, the 19th Air Refueling Group, stationed at Robins AFB, Georgia provided worldwide in-flight refueling for combat, logistics, and combat support aircraft of the United States and its allies as directed by the Department of Defense.
The 19th Air Refueling Group was inactivated in June 2008 as a result of realignment due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005.

Fonds Coislin

Fonds Coislin () is a collection (or fonds) of Greek manuscripts acquired by Pierre Séguier, but named after Henri-Charles de Coislin, its second owner. It is now held in the National Library of France, as one of three fonds of Greek manuscripts: "fonds grec", "fonds Coislin", and "supplément grec". 
History of collection.
The majority of these manuscripts were collected between 1643 and 1653, by Père Athanase the Rhetor, who bought them for Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), chancellor of France from 1635. Athanase bought the manuscripts in Cyprus, Constantinople, Mount Athos, and in other territories bordering the northern and western Aegean. 
The collection contains almost 400 manuscripts. Athanase collected more than 300 manuscripts (probably 358) personally. After Séguier's death, all this collection was inherited by his grandson, Henri-Charles de Coislin (1664–1732), bishop of Metz. He gave it to the Benedictine monks of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. 
The first catalogue of this collection, the Coislin catalogue, was made in 1715, in which 42 manuscripts were described (Bernard de Montfaucon, "Bibliotheca Coisliniana olim Segueriana", Paris: Ludovicus Guerin & Carolus Robustel, 1715). A large part of the collection was burned in 1793, and in 1795 "Fonds Coislin" was deposited in the National Library of France, where it has been held until the present day. A few manuscripts, bought by Russians in time of Catherine II, now are held at Saint Petersburg, (s.v. Dubrowski). 
One of the best known manuscripts of the collection is the fragmentary uncial Codex Coislinianus. The collection also includes Minuscule 35 (Coislin 199), now considered to be one of the best witness of the Byzantine text-type, and the basis for "The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition" (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 2007). The collection also includes further witnesses to the text of the New Testament, as well as to the Septuagint, Josephus, and other ancient, and medieval authors.

ZAS Airline of Egypt

ZAS Airline of Egypt was an airline from Egypt that operated between 1982 and 1995.
Company history.
ZAS Airline of Egypt was founded by two brothers, Sherif and Emir Zarkani, as a freight airline. Operations started on November 23, 1982 with a flight from Cairo to Amsterdam to London. In 1987 ZAS was granted a license to carry passenger charter operations. Flights to Jeddah for the Hajj were begun that year and then flights to Western Europe.
ZAS operated a variety of aircraft, from old Boeing 707s to modern MD-87s and Airbus A300s. The Gulf War of 1990-91 brought a downturn in the Egyptian tourist business and ZAS was heavily affected. After increasing difficulties, all operations ceased in April 1995.

History.
On March 6, 2007 the Ontario government announced a new distance education and training network to be created in Southern Ontario. This was done with the idea that all Ontarians deserved an equal opportunity to pursue post-secondary education. Contact North was asked to facilitate the project, due to their 20 years of experience in distance education in Northern Ontario.
Temporarily called the Eastern & Southern Ontario Distance Education and Training Network opened the first five eLearning Centres by October 2007. On May 30, 2008 the network finally gained an official name, elearnnetwork.ca and launched its website. The website contains a database of all distance courses offered by partner colleges and universities.
In the Spring of 2009, elearnnetwork.ca expanded to an additional 12 locations across the region.

Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2008

The first Green Party of England and Wales leadership election ended on 5 September 2008 at 8pm.
The election follows the party's decision to replace its current system of two Principal Speakers with a single leader. The change was supported by one Principal Speaker, Caroline Lucas, but opposed by the other, Derek Wall. It gained the support of 73% of party members who cast a vote.
Caroline Lucas launched a campaign for the Leadership on 14 July. The other candidate for the leadership was Ashley Gunstock, an actor best known for his role in "The Bill".
Only one candidate stood for the Deputy Leadership, Adrian Ramsay, leader of the Green group on Norwich City Council. He is a supporter of Lucas and under party gender balance rules, can only be elected to the post if a woman is elected to the leadership.
Nominations for both the Leadership and Deputy Leadership closed on 31 July 2008, following which, ballot papers were distributed. In order to assist candidates with canvassing, the party's Standing Orders Committee decided to release the contact details of 7,000 members to the candidates. More than 100 party members signed a protest letter which questioned whether this publication was legal under the Data Protection Act. The issue became moot when all three candidates declined to request contact details. 
Hustings took place at the Green Party of England and Wales' conference, and the results were announced on 5 September at approximately 8pm.
Results.
The turnout was 37.9% (of a membership of 7,565). This was an increase from the 20% turnout for the election of the Principal Speakers in 2007.
The results were as follows:

USS Spark (1813)

USS "Spark" (1813) was a heavily armed brig in the services of the United States Navy, built for service in the War of 1812. However, she was completed too late for that war and was assigned, instead, to the Barbary Wars in the Mediterranean. After two voyages in support of that action, she was assigned to suppress pirates in the Caribbean, where she was successful in capturing a number of pirate ships and their crews.
Built in New York.
The first ship to be so named by the Navy, "Spark" -- a privateer built in 1813 at Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York -- was purchased by the Navy at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1814 for service in the war with England. However, the war ended before the brig could get to sea for active service against the Royal Navy.
Barbary Wars service.
"Spark", commanded by Lt. Thomas Gamble, departed New York City on 20 May 1815 and sailed for the Mediterranean for operations in Commodore Stephen Decatur's squadron against pirates of Algiers. 
She reached Gibraltar on 15 June and, two days later, helped in operations resulting in the capture of the Algerian flagship, "Mashuda", near Cape de Gatt. On the 19th, she aided "Epervier", "Torch", and "Spitfire" in running "Estedio" ashore where she was boarded and captured. 
After cruising in the Mediterranean through the summer, "Spark" sailed for home on 6 October in a squadron commanded by Commodore William Bainbridge and reached Newport, Rhode Island, on 15 November and was laid up for repairs.
Recommissioned for dispatch duty.
Recommissioned on 1 July 1816, the brig sailed again for the Mediterranean on 6 September carrying a letter from the President of the United States for the Dey of Algiers and orders appointing Commodore Isaac Chauncey and Consul-General Shalter commissioners to negotiate for peace. "Spark" cruised in the Mediterranean until returning home in 1821.
Fighting Caribbean pirates.
In the autumn of 1821, "Spark", now commanded by Lt. John H. Elton, departed Boston, Massachusetts, for the Caribbean for operations against pirates. In January 1822, he captured a Dutch sloop and brought her and seven pirates to Charleston, South Carolina, for trial. She returned to the Caribbean and spent over three years suppressing buccaneers. 
The brig returned home in 1825 and was sold at New York City in 1826.

Felix Douma

Felix Douma (August 6, 1941 – January 23, 2008) was a Dutch-born Canadian scholar, writer, teacher, cellist, and translator who once served as Canada's Third Secretary and Vice-Consul to the Dominican Republic.
Biography.
Douma was born in Heerenveen, Friesland, Netherlands, to Sjoeke Tjerk (George) and Johanna Douma. After World War II, at the age of 12, Douma immigrated with his parents and two younger brothers, Alex and Ed, to Otterville, Ontario, Canada where he became a Canadian citizen. He attended South Norwich Public School, and later earned his high school diploma with honors as Valedictorian from Norwich District High School in nearby Norwich, Ontario. 
After earning his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario and his Master of Arts from the University of Toronto, Douma was hired as an officer with Canada's Department of External Affairs. He was posted to the Dominican Republic as Third Secretary and Vice-Consul from 1966 to 1968. 
Douma earned the distinction of Canada Council doctoral fellow from 1968 to 1973. 
Douma was frequent lecturer in English at Huron University College and the University of Western Ontario in 1973 and 1974. 
In 1975, Douma began his teaching career at Big River Indian reserve (Cree), a primary school near Victoire Saskatchewan. This experience inspired Douma's first book, "MOONYASS", in which he describes what life was like in and around an Indian school during a year on the reserve. During this time, Douma earned a citation for bravery from the Canadian Red Cross Society in Regina, Saskatchewan for an incident in which he came to the aid of some children in peril at a nearby lake. 
For most of the 1980s Douma taught English and French at Orchard Park Secondary School, Stoney Creek, Ontario, and Winona High School, Wentworth County, Ontario. During this time, he played third cello with the Mississauga Symphony Orchestra in Mississauga Ontario. 
In the mid-1990s Douma opened a cultural center for Port Rowan, which he affectionately named "The Hobby Palace". He would often host concerts, art exhibitions and other cultural pursuits. In addition, he ran a small publishing company named "Leeboard Press". The press published some of his own works, the final works of Robert Finch (poet), and some postcards and other printed material. 
Douma retired from teaching in 1990 after a twelve year leg instructing English, and English as a Second Language at Valley Heights Secondary School in Norfolk County, Ontario. 
In 1992, Douma wrote his second book "The Magic Fish". This book contains six stories for children, inspired by his time almost 20 years earlier at the Little Creek Indian Reserve in northern Saskatchewan. 
Douma continued to publish papers, articles and essays and was a frequent contributor to the "Port Rowan Good News" during his retirement.
On January 23, 2008, Douma died at his home in Port Rowan Ontario at 66 years of age.
Education.
Douma earned his first post secondary degree with a B.A. in English and Philosophy at the University of Western Ontario in 1960. 
He attained a Master of Arts in Philosophy at the University of Toronto in 1964. 
Douma returned to his birth country of the Netherlands, where he earned a Doctorandus in Letters, Comparative Literature and Translation Studies at the University of Amsterdam in 1972.
Douma returned to the University of Toronto for further qualifications for instructing English as a Second Language, French and Music. He earned the OSSTF Rating of IV, and a Bachelor of Education degree in 1979
Publications.
Several dozen book and concert reviews and articles by Felix Douma have appeared in The Simcoe Reformer and The Port Rowan Good News in the period 1988-2008. Douma read many stories such as "The White Woman," "The Terrible Stranger," "The Bear and the Raven," and "The Magic Fish" on CJRT-FM (Toronto's) programming "Stories and Music for Children."
Felix Douma has also prepared a translation of the second edition of G. Hulshoff, "The Six Suites for Violoncello Solo by Johann Sebastian Bach: A Handbook on Bach's Music for Violoncello Solo," originally published by Van Loghum Slaterus, Arnhem, The Netherlands, in 1962. Translation published and available from Leeboard Press, Hockley Valley Ontario.

Joseph Armitage Robinson, KCVO, DD (9 January 1858 – 7 May 1933) was a priest in the Church of England and scholar. He was successively Dean of Westminster (1902–1911) and of Wells (1911–1933).
Biography.
Robinson was educated at Liverpool College and Christ's College, Cambridge of which he became a Fellow.
In January 1902 he was appointed a Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King Edward VII, and shortly thereafter Dean of Westminster, in which position he served until he was appointed Dean of Wells in 1911. It has been suggested that the move to Wells was arranged to avoid friction in the run-up to the coronation of George V.
Robinson was Lord High Almoner from 1906 to 1933.
As Dean of Wells Robinson enjoyed close links with Downside Abbey. He also critically explored the origins of the Glastonbury legends to which the Glastonbury Festival had revived attention. A renowned scholar in patristics (he was particularly known for his work on the Lausiac History), Armitage Robinson was a participant in the bilateral Anglican-Roman Catholic Malines Conversations. He held honorary doctorates from Göttingen and Halle.
He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1932, and died on 7 May 1933.

<doc id="18530670" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18530670" title="Stаcking window manager">
Stаcking window manager

A stacking window manager is a window manager that draws all windows in a specific order, allowing them to overlap, using a technique called painter's algorithm. All window managers which allow the overlapping of windows, but are not compositing window managers are considered stacking window managers, although it is possible that not all use exactly the same methodologies. Other window managers that are not considered stacking window managers are those that do not allow the overlapping of windows. These are called tiling window managers.
Stacking window managers allow windows to overlap by drawing them one at a time. Stacking, or repainting (in reference to painter's algorithm) refers to the rendering of each window as an image, painted directly over the desktop, and over any other windows that might already have been drawn, effectively erasing the areas that are covered. The process usually starts with the desktop, and proceeds by drawing each window and any child windows from back to front, until finally the foreground window is drawn.
The order in which windows are to be stacked is called their z-order.
Limitations.
Stacking is a very slow process, requiring the redrawing of every window one-by-one, from the rear-most and outer-most to the front most and inner-most. Many stacking window managers don't always redraw background windows. Others can detect when a redraw of all windows is required, as some applications request stacking when their output has changed. Re-stacking is usually done through a function call to the window manager, which selectively redraws windows as needed. For example if a background window is brought to the front, only that window should need to be redrawn.
A well-known disadvantage of stacking is that when windows are painted over each other, they actually end up erasing the previous contents of whatever part of the screen they are covering. Those windows must be redrawn when they are brought to the foreground, or when visible parts of them change. When a window has changed or when its position on the screen has changed, the window manager will detect this and may re-stack all windows, requiring that each window redraw itself, and pass its new appearance along to the window manager before it is drawn. When an application stops responding, it may be unable to redraw itself, which sometimes causes the area within the window frame to retain images of other windows when it is brought to the foreground. This problem is commonly seen on Windows XP and earlier, as well as some X window managers.
Another serious limitation that affects almost all stacking window managers is that they are often severely limited in the degree to which the interface can be accelerated by a graphics processing unit (GPU), and very little can be done about this.
Avoiding Limitations.
Some technological advances have been able to reduce or remove some of the disadvantages of stacking. One possible solution to the limited availability of hardware acceleration is to treat a single foreground window as a special case, rendering it differently from other windows.
This does not always require a redesign of the window manager because a foreground window is drawn last, in a known locations of the screen, and is not covered by any other windows. Therefore it can be easily isolated on the screen after it has been drawn. For one, since we know where the foreground window is, when the screen raster reaches the graphics hardware, the area occupied by the foreground window can be easily replaced with an accelerated texture.
However if the window manager is also able to supply an application with an updated image of what the screen looked like before the foreground window was drawn but after all other windows were already drawn more possibilities open up. This would allow the one window in the foreground to appear semi-transparent, by using the before image as a texture filter on the final output. This was possible in Windows XP with software included with many NVidia GeForce video cards as well as from third party sources, using a hardware texture overlay.
Another method of lessening the limitations of stacking is through the use of a hardware overlay and chroma keying. Since the video hardware can draw on the outgoing screen, a window is drawn containing a known colour, which allows the video hardware to detect which parts of the window are showing and should be drawn on. 3D and 2D accelerated video and animation may be added to windows using this method.
Full screen video may also be considered a way of avoiding limitations imposed by stacking. Full screen mode temporarily suspends the need for any window management, allowing applications to have full access to the video card. Accelerated 3D games under Windows XP and earlier relied totally on this method, as these games would not have been possible to play in windowed mode. However technically this method has nothing to do with the window manager, and is simply a means of superseding it.
Hybrid Window Managers.
Some window managers may be able to treat the foreground window in an entirely different way, by rendering it indirectly, and sending its output to the video card at to be added to the outgoing raster. While this technique may be possible to accomplish within some stacking window managers, it is technically compositing, with the foreground window and the screen raster being treated the same way two windows would be in a compositing window manager.
As described earlier, we might have access to a slightly earlier stage of stacking where the foreground window has not been drawn yet. Even if it is later drawn and set to the video card, it is still possible to simply overwrite it entirely at the hardware level with the slightly out of date version, and then create the composite without even having to draw in the original location of the window. This allows the foreground window to be transparent, or even three dimensional.
Unfortunately interacting with objects outside the original area of the foreground window might also be impossible, since the window manager would not be able to determine what the user is seeing, and would pass such mouse clicks to whatever programs occupied those areas of the screen during the last stacking event.
In the X window system.
Stacking window managers under the X window system have the same limitations as any other stacking window manager on any other platform except one: they are fully interchangeable. With the addition of XComposite, this parenting information may be used in different ways, including the implementation of compositing window managers, or ignored as the case may be with tiling window managers, but regardless of its presence or absence full application support is maintained, allowing virtually all programs written for one window manager to work seamlessly with any other. (See X window manager)
Microsoft Windows.
Windows has used stacking ever since Windows 2.0, with the addition of overlapping windows. Prior to that, MS windows used a Tiling window manager. This window manager has remained virtually unchanged since then.
Windows XP still exclusively uses a stacking window manager, which has presented severe limitations to its ability to display hardware accelerated content inside normal windows, although it is technically possible to produce some visual effects using third-party software.

Video-ready access device

A video-ready access device (VRAD) provides digital subscriber line access and high-definition television programming to customers subscribed to IPTV services such as AT&T's U-verse, Bell Canada's Bell Fibe TV, Claro Puerto Rico's Claro TV, and Telus's Optik TV. VRAD equipment manufactured by Alcatel-Lucent can be configured to support between 48 and 864 lines per box. The VRAD boxes are composed of circuit boards providing service, fed by fiber-optic cable.
AT&T VRADs.
There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by AT&T: FTTN (fiber to the node), and FTTP (fiber to the premises).
FTTN, widely used where copper facilities exist in established neighborhoods, uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7330 Intelligent Services Access Manager (ISAM) shelf, which uses the existing copper wiring to customers' homes, leading to distance limitations from the VRAD cabinet to the customer's home. The 7330 ISAM is an internet protocol DSL access multiplexer that supports VDSL and ADSL protocols.
The FTTP system uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7340 ISAM shelf, which is mostly used in areas such as new neighborhoods or large-scale developments where fiber can be run to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a serving area interface, which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which is then split into 32 customer fiber pairs. In FTTP systems, the fiber pairs are typically led into a customer's residence at the network interface device. In FTTD (fiber to the desk) systems, the fiber can continue to an equipment room or garage, then to a decoder box or residential gateway, then to the customer's TV, computer, and phone lines.
The VRAD typically connects upstream to an Alcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet service switch in the central office hub, then to the headend video hub office.
VRADs required for U-verse are around wide, tall, and deep. Size and graffiti risk have drawn complaints from homeowners. AT&T has sued competitor Comcast for Chicago ads against AT&T's "large and unsightly" VRADs. Four VRADs have exploded due to faulty lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Avestor (now bankrupt), at least one explosion sending parts "fifty feet throughout the neighborhood." AT&T replaced all 17,000 Avestor batteries used in its VRADs with safer Alcatel-Lucent-designed SAFT NiCad batteries, which have a 10-year life.
Other VRADs.
Bell Canada's Bell Fibe TV and Telus's Optik TV also use VRADs in their networks. Bell Canada uses the Alcatel-Lucent 7330 and Ikanos Communications IKNS ISAMs, and provides Internet service via either FTTN to 50 Mbit/s, or FTTH (fibre to the home) to 175 Mbit/s.
Claro Puerto Rico is currently deploying VRADs to offer their IPTV and VDSL Internet service up to 50Mbit/s. There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by Claro: FTTN (fiber to the node), and FTTP (fiber to the premises). It is unknown the equipment they are using.

Mohamed Noor

Mohamed Noor is the Earl D. McLean Professor and Chair of the Biology Department at Duke University. His specialties include Evolution, Genetics and Genomics. 
With a BS from the College of William and Mary (1992) and a PhD from University of Chicago (1996), together with a postdoctoral residency at Cornell University (1996–1998), he specializes in Drosophila evolution. His team's research approaches have included both classical genetic mapping as well as analyses of whole genome sequences.
Likewise, Noor was one of the first scientists to demonstrate by experiment speciation by "reinforcement", that is, as a result of natural selection mating preferences diverge against deleterious hybridization and reduce gene flow between species. He is also known for developing (along with others) a model wherein regions of restricted recombination, as by chromosomal inversions, facilitate the persistence of hybridizing species.
More recently, his research team has focused on understanding variation in recombination rate within and between species, and its impact on DNA sequence variation.
In 2008 he was awarded the Darwin-Wallace Medal from the Linnean Society of London.
He was editor for the international journal "Evolution", is or was associate editor for several other journals, and the author of over 100 publications. He has served as president of the American Genetic Association and Society for the Study of Evolution and as a board member for the Genetics Society of America.
Noor has been active in education and outreach, receiving numerous teaching and mentoring awards from his institution, and more recently teaching an online course in genetics and evolution. He and his group have also developed laboratory activities for implementation in high schools and colleges, including a commercial kit for observing natural selection in Drosophila.

Digital Accounting Collection

The Digital Accounting Collection (DAC) is part of the University of Mississippi Libraries. The collection contains both current and historical accounting materials, with over 2,400 items in digitized searchable full-text format, and over 33,000 bibliographic citations for other materials.
Within the DAC, there are several discrete collections, most in full text. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ non-current professional standards, codes of professional conduct, and exposure drafts relate to professional auditing and accounting standards in the United States. The Academy of Accounting Historians' Journal and Notebook contain, respectively, scholarly research on accounting history and information on the activities of the Academy. The Accounting Pamphlets - Full-Text collection contains searchable full-text accounting pamphlets that are not under copyright. The McMickle and Accounting Pamphlets – Citations Only collections list in searchable indexes an eclectic mix of thousands of accounting monographs. The Photographs and Illustrations collection offers portraits and drawings related to accounting.
The Digital Accounting Collection may be searched in several ways. The bibliographic entries are searched by categories such as title, author, keyword, and subject. The full- text items may be searched in toto. A “Browse Subjects” page offers a list of all the subjects under which the full-text items are indexed.
__TOC__
Collections.
The Accounting Historians Journal - Full-Text.
1974 - June, 2011
The "Accounting Historians Journal" is available in digital full-text thanks to the kind permission of the Academy of Accounting Historians. Included are files and bibliographic records for each issue and for each major item in each issue. From 1974 to 1992, both a searchable PDF and a separate page-image PDF are provided. From 1993 to 1998, the PDF page image contains embedded searchable text, reflecting advances in PDF technology. As the software does not always translate images to text accurately and proofreaders do not catch all the software reading errors, having both an image and a searchable text file allows the researcher immediately to check the accuracy of any questionable transcription. Beginning in 1999, native (searchable) PDFs are provided by the publisher.
Accounting Historians Notebook - Full-Text.
1978 - April, 2011
The "Accounting Historians Notebook" is available for the first time in digital full-text thanks to the kind permission of the Academy of Accounting Historians. Included are files and bibliographic records for each issue and for each major item in each issue. From 1978 to 2003, the scanned page images have embedded searchable text. Beginning in 2004, native (searchable) PDFs are provided by the publisher.
AICPA Codes of Professional Conduct - Full-Text.
The AICPA Codes of Professional Conduct collection includes the following:
1. The ET (ethics) sections from the Professional Standards from 1974 through 2005
2. The BL (by-laws) sections of the Professional Standards from 1974 through 2005
3. Separately published pamphlets of the Code from 1917 through 1997
4. The By-laws as they are included with the Code in the separately issued pamphlets (1917–1997).
5. Commentaries on the Code by A. P. Richardson, John L. Carey, and John L. Carey and William O. Doherty
For links to these items see AICPA Code of Professional Conduct.
AICPA Exposure Drafts Collection - Full-Text.
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as a standards promulgating body, has published drafts of proposed standards and circulated them for comment. These drafts represent a critical phase in the standards setting procedure and are studied by practitioners and historians alike. As they were not originally meant to be part of the permanent record, copies of these drafts are often difficult to locate. Non-current drafts are now available digitally with the kind permission of the AICPA. Each bibliographic record is accompanied by a PDF page image file with a searchable text behind each page image.
The McMickle Collection.
In 1996, Dr. Peter McMickle of Memphis donated his collection of rare accounting books to the Academy of Accounting Historians, with the provision that the library be housed at Ole Miss. The library consists of more than 1,200 individual titles, with more than 500 volumes dating from the 19th century and the oldest volume dating back to 1655.
The McMickle Collection is located in the Patterson School of Accountancy. The items do not circulate. Small travel grants to use the collection are available to members of the Academy of Accounting Historians.
Accounting Pamphlets Collection - Full-Text.
Of the thousands of accounting pamphlets in the University of Mississippi’s AICPA collection, some of those in the public domain have been digitized and are available in searchable full-text. These include governmental publications such as the SEC’s Accounting Series Releases (Nos. 1- 140, 1937-1973; search under the title “Accounting Series Release”) and old CPA exams published by the states. Items published prior to 1923 or for which copyright was not renewed are also in the public domain. For example, early 20th-century pamphlets often provided practical guidance to bookkeepers on the accounting for particular trades, industries, or services. The AICPA library collected these ephemeral treasures for over eighty years and many are available digitally. In some instances, a PDF containing page images is provided along with a separate PDF with searchable text. In other instances, only one file containing both the searchable text and the image is provided (reflecting advances in PDF technology).
Accounting Pamphlets - Collection of Bibliographic Citations Only.
Various Dates.
This is a catalog of over 33,000 accounting pamphlets owned by the University of Mississippi library and originally collected by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Only brief bibliographic citations are given: author, title, publisher and date. When available, the subject classification number from the original AICPA library collection is also included. The collection is housed in archival boxes and a box number is included in the record for retrieval purposes. Please include the box number when requesting material from the collection. The collection includes a wide range of materials ranging from the late nineteenth century through 2000. Besides the traditional pamphlet materials, there are article reprints and clippings from trade journals, individual journal issues containing accounting articles, short runs of professional newsletters from accounting organizations around the world, and legal briefs. Also check the University of Mississippi libraries catalog for other materials.
Photographs and Illustrations Collection.
The art illustrating the accounting literature from the Summa to the present is surely one of the most underappreciated aspects of accounting history. This collection includes the frontispieces of 16th- and 17th-century accounting texts; cartoons and illustrations from 19th- and early 20th-century books, logos, and mastheads; and photographs from early organizational meetings, early journals and books, and from the pages of the "Accounting Historians Journal" and "Accounting Historians Notebook".
History.
The DAC had its origins in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Library. The Institute’s Library began in 1918 with 2,000 books and pamphlets, part of the collection being a donation of Leonard H. Conant, a former president of the organization. An endowment fund organized by George O. May helped sustain the library’s collections through the years. In 2000, the AICPA decided to transfer its library to a University. The Institute selected the University of Mississippi as the new home for the collection and the transfer was made in August, 2001. Service to the AICPA membership as well as the larger scholarly community has continued from the University of Mississippi location. A grant from the Institute of Museums and Library Services provided the funding to begin digitizing some of the rare and unique items in the collection as well as information useful to practicing accountants. The Digital Accounting Collection is the end result of these many efforts.
Technology.
A number of technologies have been used over the course of the digitization project. Early scanned documents were edited using Adobe Acrobat Professional versions 6, 7, 8. More recently, ABBYY FineReader has been used for editing.
Bibliographic data is entered in Dublin Core format using MetaData Builder, a product from library automation vendor, Innovative Interfaces, Inc. Digital objects such as PDFs and jpeg images are attached and displayed using another Innovative Interface product, Media Management. Finally, the collection is displayed and searched using the Innovative Interfaces web opac product.

Kelly Hogan

Kelly Hogan (born January 11, 1965) is an American singer-songwriter, often known for her work as a member of Neko Case's backing band, as well as for her solo work.
Early life.
Hogan was born in born in Atlanta, Georgia, the daughter of a former Vietnam War Army veteran helicopter pilot who went on to become a policeman. Hogan's parents divorced, with her mother later remarrying and relocating to Rutledge, Georgia while her dad still lives in Douglasville, Georgia.
Hogan is the oldest sister in her family. She has younger brothers.
Because both her parents worked, Hogan and her siblings spent most of their time with her grandmother in her apartment in midtown/downtown Atlanta growing up, where they listened to country music station WPLO. Hogan said that although none of her family are musicians, music was always on in her house somewhere.
She went to high school in Douglasville, Georgia. Although painfully shy, Hogan eventually auditioned for chorus, going to All State Chorus every year. In addition to being active in chorus and drama, Hogan said she started singing in bars when she was in high school.
Hogan often goes by the moniker "Hogan." She is an avid dog lover, and used to tend bar and tour accompanied by her late dog Augie.
Hogan has a Jim Stacy tramp stamp tattoo "above my ass it says, 'Singers get all the pussy.'"
She lives in Evansville, Wisconsin.
Musical career.
The Jody Grind.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hogan sang with the cabaret, country, jazz, and punk band The Jody Grind (Band US) (a Cabbagetown, Atlanta band originated by Bill Taft), singing on their full-lengths "One Man's Trash Is Another Man's Treasure" (1990) and "Lefty's Deceiver" (1992). Jody Grind would tour with singer Robyn Hitchcock. The group disbanded after two of its members were killed in a car crash.
Rock*A*Teens.
In the mid-1990s, Hogan joined the indie rock band Rock*A*Teens, another Cabbagetown, Atlanta area band, appearing on their 1996 EP and the 1997 full-length "Cry". Kelly Hogan played guitar and sang backing vocals in the band from 1994 to 1997. After the release of "Cry," Hogan left the Rock*A*Teens and relocated from Atlanta to Chicago.
Solo career.
Her debut solo record, "The Whistle Only Dogs Can Hear" was released in 1996, and featured covers of songs by Will Oldham and Vic Chesnutt.
Hogan released her first solo record on Bloodshot Records called "Beneath the Country Underdog" in 2000. The record, "brilliantly intuitive readings of other people's songs," was produced by Jon Langford (Mekons, Waco Brothers). The Pine Valley Cosmonauts were her backing band.
Her second solo Bloodshot release, "Because It Feel Good," was released in 2001 and was produced by Hogan and former Sugar bassist David Barbe. At the time of this record's release, rock critic Peter Margasak described Hogan as "principally an interpreter, capable of wringing more from a cover than most people can find in their own material," even though with this release she wrote two songs (with guitarist Andy Hopkins) on the record.
Hogan released her most recent solo record—and first record in 11 years -- "I Like To Keep Myself In Pain," on ANTI- in 2013. She said that she sent emails to "her songwriter friends, many of whom she’d sung with, asking them if they would send her a song, either one written specifically for her or one that 'you think I could do right by.'" Vic Chesnutt, Stephin Merritt, Andrew Bird, Jon Langford, Janet Bean, M. Ward, and others gave her songs. The title track was written by Robyn Hitchcock. For the recording of this record, "a dream-team band" was assembled: organist Booker T. Jones, drummer James Gadson (Bill Withers, Beck), bassist Gabe Roth (Dap-Kings), guitarist Scott Ligon (NRBQ). They recorded at EastWest Studios ("Pet Sounds") in Hollywood, California.
Collaborations.
Hogan appears on records by Mavis Staples, the Mekons, Will Oldham, Matt Pond PA, Amy Ray, Giant Sand, Archer Prewitt, Alejandro Escovedo, Drive-By Truckers, Jakob Dylan, Tortoise, among others.

Internet Config

Internet Config was an Internet preferences manager and API for Mac OS Classic. It was originally developed by Quinn! The Eskimo, Peter N Lewis and Marcus Jager and released in 1994 into the public domain. It was later bundled by Apple Inc..
Internet Config's purpose was to consolidate what was, at the time, an unwieldy number of options and settings related to Internet use that had not yet been integrated into the operating system's own control panel. Some settings were for a systemwide default web browser, home page, default FTP client, systemwide default download folder, and email settings. Internet Config represented an important ease of use advantage for the Macintosh platform on the early Internet.
The software consisted of two pieces, the Internet Config control panel — which was actually just a normal application — and an 'appe' extension that launched at boot time but did not patch any system traps. 
Internet Config enabled the ability for applications to support command-clicking of URLs displayed anywhere onscreen and have the URLs sent to the user selected application. For example, http: URLs would be sent to the selected web browser, ftp: URLs to the selected FTP client, mailto: URLs to the selected Email application, and so on. This functionality was made optional systemwide, as it did have to patch one trap, codice_1.
Internet Config also provided functionality to ease interoperability of the Macintosh type and creator code system with the file extensions used on the Internet and on other operating systems. API functions were provided to map file extensions to Mac type/creator information, and vice versa.
The public domain nature of the project and the tight Internet community in the late 1990s led to the rapid adoption of the facility, and then to Apple bundling it as part of Mac OS.

Protecting timber from poachers.
The schooner departed early in June and remained at Norfolk, Virginia, until the 27th when she headed for the Florida coast to protect live oak timber on public lands in the southern states. She was impeded in her voyage south by adverse winds and did not reach St. Augustine, Florida, until 12 August. She cruised along the coast of Georgia and Gulf of Mexico looking for lumber poachers until May 1832.
Decommissioning.

BRT Laboratories

BRT Laboratories, Inc. is a Baltimore, Maryland based biotechnology company that performs DNA testing. The company has three divisions: Relationship Testing, Forensics, and Clinical Services. It is a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Baltimore RH Typing Laboratory, Inc.
History.
BRT Laboratories, Inc, with its parent company Baltimore RH Typing Laboratory, has been a provider of products and services to the medical, research, and commercial communities since 1945. In April 2000, BRT Laboratories, Inc. was established as an independent and wholly owned subsidiary of Baltimore Rh Typing Laboratory, Inc., for the purpose of continuing commercial testing and service activities. This allowed the parent company to focus on its original mission of providing counseling, education, and research.
Services.
Relationship Testing.
BRT’s Relationship Testing division offers services in Paternity Testing and Family reunification Immigration Testing. DNA testing can identify relationships between parent and child, full or half siblings, grandparent and grandchild, uncles or aunts and nieces or nephews, as well as identical and non-identical twins. The Laboratory is accredited by the AABB (formerly, American Association of Blood Banks). Testing can be performed for submission in legal proceedings (court admissible) or for personal knowledge.
Application for immigration to the United States and Canada often requires documentation of biological relationship between a petitioner and his or her beneficiary. DNA testing can be used to prove a relationship if documents are absent or challenged. The US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices accept DNA testing results from AABB accredited laboratories only.
Forensics.
BRT’s Forensics division offers services in serology screening, DNA profiling, and case review. These services are contracted by government agencies, defense counsel, and private citizens or organizations for several applications. 
Government agencies contract BRT’s Forensic division for criminal and “no-suspect” casework. The Laboratory offers STR analysis and Y-STR analysis with each of the commercial kits commonly used in the US. The Forensic division is accredited by ASCLD/Lab – International and meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025. BRT has also received accreditation from the Texas Department of Public Safety and has been approved by the Maryland State Police Forensic Science Division for analysis of casework that can be uploaded to CODIS. The Laboratory adheres to current Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) and FBI DNA Advisory Board (DAB) guidelines.
Defense counsel contract BRT Laboratories to perform case reviews, which may include assistance with the interpretation of subpoena documents, sample retesting, and/or expert witness testimony.
The Forensic division also provides serology and DNA profiling services to private citizens for infidelity testing and to private organizations or medical professionals for sample identity verification.
Clinical Services.
BRT’s Clinical Services division is licensed by the State of Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for Molecular Biology and Molecular Genetics and is registered under the US Department of Health and Human Services' Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Test offerings include Tuberculosis testing and Bone Marrow Engraftment (chimerism) monitoring.
BRT’s tuberculosis (TB) testing is performed using the Interferon-gamma release assay T-SPOT.TB. This assay is recognized by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as a special TB blood test with an accuracy of diagnosing active TB >80%.
Bone Marrow Engraftment monitoring assesses the relative ratio of donor and recipient cell populations in the post-transplant peripheral blood or bone marrow of the patient. BRT performs this test using STR analysis, the current "gold standard," yielding a sensitivity of 95-98%.
Locations.
BRT is headquartered in Baltimore, MD, with an extensive network of sample collection centers located across the United States and throughout the world.

Claudia Hammond

Claudia Hammond (born 1971) is British author, occasional TV presenter, and frequent radio presenter with the BBC World Service and BBC Radio 4.
Education.
Hammond grew up in Bedfordshire. She was educated at Sussex University in applied psychology, and Surrey University, where she gained a MSc in health psychology, carrying out research into doctor–patient communication in a breast cancer unit.
Career.
Author.
Hammond is the author of a book on the science of emotions entitled "Emotional Rollercoaster", published in 2005. Reviews were positive, with one saying that although it contained 'rare errors' these mistakes are 'vastly outweighed by the wealth of fascinating observations', and that 'humour, sensitivity and warmth... emanate from every page'. 
She published her second book, "Time Warped: Unlocking the Mysteries of Time Perception", with Canongate Books in May 2012. The Financial Times calls it "a fascinating and at times mind-boggling book that will change the way you think about time."
Radio presenter.
Hammond has said that she decided that she wanted to work in radio quite suddenly, although early. "I was at a children’s book festival and, after I had queued up to get Roald Dahl’s autograph, he asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up. I’m told I said “I want to work in radio”. That was the first my parents knew about it. It was probably the first time I realised." She presents programmes about psychology on BBC Radio 4, including "All in the Mind". She also presents "Health Check" on BBC World Service Radio.
TV presenter.
In addition to presenting "Health Check" on BBC World News every Friday, Hammond has appeared on several other TV programmes (such as the One Show and BBC Breakfast) commenting on psychological topics. In the past, as reporter, she presented science and medical features for Channel 5 News.
Journalistic philosophy.
Hammond has said she tries to "give people a better understanding of the role psychology plays. Helping people articulate and get across a seemingly technical piece of good research is central to my approach. I also like bringing different specialists together – it’s amazing how often people who are hugely expert in one area of psychology know next to nothing about related work in a slightly different field." 
Despite her varied portfolio, Hammond gave 'be choosy' as a piece of careers advice in one interview:
"Popular programmes are fine – "I sometimes go on Richard & Judy to talk about psychological research – but if I think a show is going to dumb it down, I say no. And sometimes what they’re looking for is a qualified therapist, and that’s not me."

Nepalese Rastriya Panchayat election, 1971

Elections to the Rastriya Panchayat (National Council) were held in Nepal in 1971. At the time, the Rastriya Panchayat had 125 members; out of them 16 were appointed by the King, 90 were elected by Zonal Assemblies, 15 were elected by class organisations and 4 were elected by the graduates constituency.
District representatives.
The district representatives were elected by the "Anchal Sabhas" (Zonal Assemblies) of the 14 Zones of Nepal, one representative for each district. The 15 districts with a population of more than 100 000 were able to elect an additional Rastriya Panchayat member. The "Anchal Sabhas" consisted of all the members of the "Zilla Panchayats" (District Councils). Each Zilla Panchayat had 11 members, who were elected from the town or village panchayats in the district. The town and village panchayats were elected from local assemblies in which all adult residents could vote.
A potential candidate had to be a Zilla Panchayat member of the concerned district to be an eligible to contest a district seat. Moreover, the potential candidate had to be proposed and seconded by two other members of the same Zilla Panchayat. To be elected the candidate would need a simple majority of the votes in the Anchal Sabha. The system favoured the less populates areas in the hills, whose districts had a much lower population than the Terai districts in the south.
Class organisation representatives.
The following official class organisations were able to select their representatives in the Rastriya Panchayat. The representatives were elected by the central committees of the respective organisation, through a Preferential Proportional Representation vote:
Graduates constituency.
The college graduates of the country, numbering about 13000 at the time, were able to elect four members of the Rastriya Panchayat. The representatives were elected with Preferential Proportional Representation vote. The candidates had to be college graduates themselves. In total 22 candidates were in the fray. Seventeen of them contested on a joint reformist agenda. One candidate, the young advocate Ram Raja Prasad Singh, demanded direct transition to parliamentary democracy.
The prime minister Kirti Nidhi Bista campaigned against the reformist candidates as opponents of the Panchayat system. However, the regime was embarrassed as the reformist candidates were elected, including Ram Raja Prasad Singh.

Ruricius Pompeianus (d. 312 Verona) was Praetorian prefect and Commander of cavalry and infantry under Maxentius, Western Roman Emperor. While guarding the Adige and Po Rivers with the ample and well-directed forces of the province of Venetia, Pompeianus was killed by Constantine I's troops during the desperately fought Battle of Verona (312).
Pompeianus is mentioned only briefly in two accounts of Constantine's campaign against Maxentius. In a Panegyric from the year 313, he is called "Pompeianus". In the second source, also one of the Panegyrici Latini, by Nazarius, his name is given as "Ruricius". As it is clearly the same person, the conflict is usually resolved by combining the names into "Ruricius Pompeianus".

American Campus Communities

American Campus Communities Inc. (ACC and American Campus) is a university housing development company with its headquarters in Bee Cave, Texas, near Austin.
ACC is one of the largest developers and managers of private student housing in the United States. In 2004, American Campus became the first student housing real estate investment trust, (REIT) to become publicly traded. Currently, American Campus manages 145 properties with over 92,000 beds, many in partnership with universities on campus property. Some developments also involve the use of third party nonprofit owner/lessors, which allow tax-exempt bonds to be used to finance the developments.
American Campus is part of a growing trend of independently operated housing serving university students; in particular, cash-strapped public universities have found it financially beneficial to allow outside companies to assume the debt generated by housing projects, freeing up capital for the university to spend on other facilities. For example, American Campus developed and manages four properties for the University of California, Irvine, that are owned by the nonprofits EAH Housing and Collegiate Housing Foundation, respectively. While under state law, any money charged by the University of California directly for housing must be used for housing purposes, the rent paid by EAH and the Collegiate Housing Foundation for use of campus property can be used for any purpose. Further, the university bears none of the debt used to finance the property, yet uses these private owned facilities as part of the housing guarantee it extends to students.
Corporate affairs.
The company has its headquarters in Buildings S and T in the Hill Country Galleria shopping development, in Bee Cave, Texas, near Austin. The ACM headquarters occupies of space. The company offices were scheduled to open there in December 2010.
Previously American Campus Communities had its headquarters in Las Cimas, an office complex in unincorporated Travis County, Texas, near Austin. ACC sublet area that was leased by Dell USA. ACM moved out of Las Cimas and moved to Bee Caves.

Grand Boulevard (Detroit)

Grand Boulevard is a thoroughfare in Detroit, Michigan, running east to west in some places and north to south in other places. It once constituted the city limits of Detroit. Grand Boulevard is named the "Berry Gordy, Jr. Boulevard" in the area where the Motown Historical Museum is located and the "General Motors Boulevard" in the area of Detroit's "New Center" where the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place (formerly the General Motors Building) are located. Grand Boulevard is commonly referred to by residents of the city simply as "the Boulevard".
History.
As early as 1876, some Detroiters were cognizant of the efforts of Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann to make Paris into a beautiful city by designing parks, broad streets, and grand boulevards. These citizens proposed adopting Haussmann's concepts by surrounding Detroit with its own "Grand Boulevard." When Belle Isle was transferred from the state to the city of Detroit, Michigan legislator James Randall included a rider calling for the construction of this Grand Boulevard. However, the city government refused to begin work on the road right away, although a few people built homes along the Boulevard's proposed route.
Finally, in 1891, Detroit mayor Hazen S. Pingree supported the idea and broke ground on the construction of Grand Boulevard, a ring road that wrapped around the city of Detroit. The Boulevard ran for , curving from the Detroit River on the west to the very same river on the east and crossing Woodward Avenue at a point approximately north of the downtown area. The Boulevard was originally thought to represent the absolute limit of the city's expansion, although tremendous growth at the beginning of the 20th century quickly pushed the city limits far beyond Grand Boulevard to its north, its east, and its west.
By 1913, Grand Boulevard was completed, encircling the city. It was generally recognized as a major attraction of the city; the entire length was decorated with trees, shrubbery, and flowerbeds.
Many years ago, the streetcar route which traveled upon Grand Boulevard was formally called the Grand Belt line because of Grand Boulevard's belt-like configuration around the most central part of Detroit. The subsequent bus route which traveled on some, but not all, of Grand Boulevard retained the "Grand Belt" name until a service cut in 2009 eliminated that public transit coverage entirely.

C. H. B. Marsham

Cloudesley Henry Bullock "Slug" Marsham (10 February 1879 – 19 July 1928) was an English cricketer.
Primarily a batsman, he appeared for Oxford University and Kent, whom he captained to the 1906 Championship title.
Career.
Born in Bicester, Marsham was a member of a strong cricketing family: his father C. D. B. Marsham played for Oxford University and the Gentlemen, his uncles Charles and Robert appeared for Oxford University, another uncle (George) appeared for Kent and his brother Francis played for both Kent and Oxford University. His son Algernon would go on to play for both sides as well.
Marsham was sent to Eton College in 1892, where he was taught the game by Mr R. A. H. Mitchell. He played in two Eton v Harrow fixtures, before moving to Oxford University. There, he was in the eleven in 1900, 1901 and 1902, captaining the side in his last year.
Marsham combined playing for his university side with appearances for Kent, making his debut in 1900 against Nottinghamshire. Described by Wisden as "a good, but not a great batsman", he was capable of fine innings under pressure. A prime example was his maiden first-class century — 
batting for Oxford University and chasing 327 to win, the university lost seven wickets and it was left to Marsham to salvage a draw, finishing unbeaten on 100.
Marsham succeeded Cuthbert Burnup as captain of Kent at the start of the 1904 season, and two seasons later Marsham presided over Kent's first County Championship win. The "Daily Mail" wrote of him "Kent have a captain who, although young in years, possesses the judgement of a veteran", while "Wisden" told of how he "inspired his men by fine example". However, by 1909 he had dropped out of first-class cricket, playing only sporadically until 1922. During this period, he also served as a captain in the Queen's Own West Kent Yeomanry during World War I.
Marsham died in Wrotham in 1928, aged 49.

<doc id="18531293" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18531293" title="South African Commando System">
South African Commando System

The South African Commando System was a voluntary, part-time force of the South African Army, but served under the South African Police Service.
Mission.
Commandos were responsible for the safeguarding and protection of a specific community (usually rural but sometimes urban). Commando services are usually referred to as area protection, a system which involves the whole community. The participants in the Commando system do not have military commitments outside of the areas they serve, and are responsible for the safety and security of their own communities.
Each community is divided up into smaller more manageable sections called cells. Each cell comprises a number of farmers and or households, depending on the size of the area and dispersion of the area’s inhabitants. Cell members are in contact with each other by means of telephone or a radio system which serves as a backup communication system in the event of the telephone lines being out of order. Alternative communication systems are therefore a vital element of the protection plan of any cell. The cell members have a communication link with their cell leader (who is elected by the members) who, in turns, has a communication link with the local police station. This ensures quick reaction by the police in the event of an attack. The cell leader can notify the local Commando if a stronger force is required.
This process of communication is time-consuming and, therefore, the members of a cell should be able to protect themselves and rely on support from neighbours and other members of the cell to ensure immediate response in an emergency. For this reason a cell must plan for certain contingencies before they happen. The local Commando will assist the cells with drawing up contingency plans.
History.
The Commando system existed since the 1770s. The early Boer Commando system was a conscriptive service designed to provide a quickly-trained fighting force.
Commandos were a product of the First Boer War during which the fiercely independent Boers had no regular army. When danger threatened, all the men in a district would form a militia organised into military units called commandos and would elect officers. Being civilian militia, each man wore what they wished, usually everyday neutral or earthtone khaki farming clothes such as a jacket, trousers and slouch hat. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horses. The average Boer citizens who made up their commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, and because they had to depend on both their horse and their rifle for almost all of their meat, they were skilled hunters and expert marksmen. Most of the Boers had single-shot breech loading rifle such as the Westley Richards, the Martini-Henry, or the Remington Rolling Block. Only a few had repeaters like the Winchester or the Swiss Vetterli. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover, from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed the game would be long gone. At community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport and competitions used targets such as hens eggs perched on posts 100 yards away. The commandos became expert light cavalry, making use of every scrap of cover, from which they could pour an accurate and destructive fire at the British with their breech loading rifles which could be rapidly aimed, fired, and reloaded.
After the declaration of peace in 1902, the commandos were disbanded. They did reform themselves in clandestine "shooting clubs". In 1912, the commandos were reformed as an Active Citizen Force in the Union Defence Force. This system was in operation until in February 2003, President Mbeki announced the disbanding of the commando system over six years, to be replaced by 'specialised police units'. The Democratic Alliance has stated that this action is a 'total disaster'.
It's spokesman, Armiston Watson said that "the disbanding of the rural commandos (announced by the government in 2003) was an irresponsible political move which now leaves all farmers and farm workers defenceless and easy targets for criminals."
Agri SA Chairman Kiewiet Ferreira, a farmer in the central Free State Province town of Harrismith said: "We need commandos, and we see them as one of the backbones of the rural protection plan, without a doubt" He also pointed out that, in 1998, former President Nelson Mandela included the commandos in a rural security plan, and "encouraged farmers, especially white farmers, to join the commandos and help in rural protection".
"If you into account how many operations commandos have been involved in, under the police - more than 50,000 operations in 2001 and 37,000 operations in 2002 (most of them road-blockades, foot patrols, vehicle patrols, farm visits, manning of observation posts) - that's nearly 90,000 operations in two years," Ferreira said.
Structure.
At least during the Second Boer War each commando was attached to a town, after which it was named (e.g. Bloemfontein Commando). Each town was responsible for a district, divided into wards. The Commando was commanded by a Kommandant and each ward by a "Veldkornet" or fieldcornet - equavilent of a senior NCO rank.
The Veldkornet was responsible not only for calling up the burghers, but also for policing his ward, collecting taxes, issuing firearms and other material in times of war. Theoretically, a ward was divided into corporalships. A corporalship was usually made up of about 20 burghers. Sometimes entire families filled a corporalship.
The Veldkornet was responsible to the Kommandant, who in turn was responsible to a General. In theory, a General was responsible for four commandos. He in turn was Responsible to the Commander-in-Chief (CIC) of the Republic. In the Transvaal, the CIC was called the Commandant-General and in the Free State the "Hoofdkommandant" or Chief Commandant. The CIC was responsible to the President. 
Other auxiliary ranks were created in war time, such as "Vleiskorporaal" ("meat corporal"), responsible for issuing rations.
"The farmer-commandos receive a few weekends of training as army reservists and are each given an assault rifle. When they respond to an incident, the police do, too. But the police force is stretched thin in farm areas, trying to cover vast areas with few officers or vehicles. The farmers often get there much sooner."
The retirement age of members of the commandos is 65 though it can be extended to 75 years.
In a document called: Ploughing in Resources - The Investigation of Farm Attacks it says: 
Disbandment.
The system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 “because of the role it played in the apartheid era”, according to the Minister of Safety and Security Charles Nqakula. This followed growing pressure after incidents of ongoing abuse of power were reported. 
The last commando unit, that at Harrismith in the Free State, was disbanded in March 2008. At their peak 186 of these units, ranging in size from a company to a battalion, existed. The number of individual commando members varied according to different sources, but it is estimated that there were between 50,000 and 70,000.
Weaponry.
From the early days up until the present, the commandos were issued with firearms by the government of the day. The burghers were obliged to keep these firearms serviceable and ready at all times.

Bogotá Metro

The Bogotá Metro is a proposed rapid transit line in Bogotá, Colombia expected to be completed in 2018. The construction of the Metro de Bogotá has been the subject of debates and studies since the 1950s when the collapse of the Bogotá Tramways made evident the need of a modern form of mass transport for the fast growing metropolis. It has been suggested that the system rail paths of the defunct Bogotá’s Savannah Railway will be utilized for the new city train system.
Overview.
In 2007, Samuel Moreno won the elections for Mayor of Bogotá under the promise of building an underground rapid transit system to increase the mobility of people in the city, reduce the commute time and increase the comfort of the trip by reducing the number of people per wagon. At that time Moreno suggested that the train’s first line be drawn from the locality of Kennedy along the Avenida del Ferrocarril up to the Estacion de la Sabana on Calle 13 or Avenida Jimenez and from there northwards along the Avenida Septima up to Calle 72, then along Calle 72 to end up in Engativá. However, the final design was to be decided by the winner of a public tender for the feasibility studies of the project. 
On August 2009, the feasibility studies, which includes economical resources, best line route, urbanistic and environmental influence, were started by Sener-TMB. The result was to be announced on July 20, but was delayed to August 31. The announcement was: running from Transmilenio's Portal de las Américas in Kennedy, the subway will reach the Estacion de la Sabana near downtown, first underground, then by road-leveled tracks. From there it will run underground to Tercer Milenio Park, turn north following 13th road and 11th road. It will end in Calle 127 with NQS Highway, in northeast Bogota.
In September 2009, Bogotá's mayor, Samuel Moreno, announced that the system may be in operation by 2016. However, fiscal troubles besieged the city during Moreno's tenure, and in 2010 he was arrested for improprieties in the appropriation of city contracts for public works projects. This threw the fiscal feasibility of the Metro project into doubt. As of 2011, the administration of the new mayor Gustavo Petro has announced that it will push for construction to start in 2013.

Poll average

A poll average is the result of someone taking the combined information from many different opinion polls that deal with the same issue and synthesizing the information into a new set of numbers.
The problem with this is that each poll is usually conducted in a slightly different manner, which technically cannot be combined into one poll. Polls in themselves contain uncertainty because they are only using a sample of the population. The uncertainty is measurable, which we usually call the margin of error. An inaccurate way to conduct a poll average is to treat each poll as though they were exactly the same in uncertainty. The reason for this is that this type of poll average gives less weight to the polls that have less uncertainty.
However, if you account for the variation in polls due to each poll's unique sample size, you can combine the polls into a poll average. This means the only assumption you are making is that each poll was conducted in a similar manner. You can also measure the uncertainty of this poll average.

Lying Jim Townsend

James William Emery Townsend (1838-1900), more commonly known as Lying Jim, was the original of Bret Harte’s “Truthful James,” the source of Mark Twain’s Jumping Frog story, and much more. According to The Western Literature Association, Townsend “was one of the most talented and notorious liars of the Comstock, no small accomplishment. He was famous for his ability to spin elaborate and elegant yarns at a moment’s notice. Twain mentions him in "Roughing It" as being hoaxed by an even greater lie than he could compose, but this was early in his career. In later life he participated in one of the most creative scams in Comstock history when he singlehandedly printed a regular newspaper in a deserted mining town, peopling it with imaginary citizens and reporting in detail about them and fictional mining operations, so that foreign investors could be inveigled into buying stock in nonexistent companies. Some of his journalism has been collected, but more needs to be known about Townsend and his literary prevarications.” He was a member of the Sagebrush School of writers.
Some “Townsendisms”.
Mill Creek is so crooked in one place that it is difficult to cross it. We waded
it half a dozen times the other day and came out on the same side every time.
The Waters of Mono Lake are so buoyant that the bottom has to be bolted

The bottom of the screen proposes simple action commands, like see, take or push; however, the game is entirely in Japanese (although it uses katakana exclusively). One of the original features of the game is to use real sampled sound in some places, which is very unusual for the time.

Martynas Jankus

Martin Jankus (lit. Martynas Jankus [http://www.ortsfamilienbuecher.de/famreport.php?ofb=memelland&ID=I75111&nachname=JANKUS&modus=&lang=de]) (August 7, 1858 in Bittehnen (lit. Bitėnai), near Ragnit – May 23, 1946 in Flensburg, Germany, reburied in Bitėnai cemetery on May 30, 1993) was a Prussian-Lithuanian printer, social activist and publisher in East Prussia, called the Patriarch of Lithuania Minor. He was one of the publishers of "Aušra", the first Lithuanian-language newspaper. Jankus used various pen names, including V. Giedris, Martyneitis, Bitėnų Merčius, Gyvoleitis.
Biography.
After graduating from a primary school in Bitėnai, Jankus continued self-education. Since the last decade of the 19th century he was an important figure in the pro-Lithuanian movement, and was close to the Lithuanian National Revival movement in Lithuania. He was one of the founders of several cultural organizations, including "Birutė", founded in 1885 in Tilsit. In 1889-1892 Jankus was its chairman. In 1890, together with Dovas Zaunius and Jonas Smalakis, Jankus founded the first Lithuanian political organization in East Prussia. He maintained active correspondence with Lithuanian Americans and activists of the Latvian, Polish and Belarusian national movements.
For his public activities Martynas Jankus was penalized by the Prussian authorities about forty times – arrests, monetary fines, and the like. He spent his earnings on the publication of Lithuanian books and newspapers during the Lithuanian press ban in Russia. Jankus was one of the suppliers for the knygnešiai, smugglers of illegal books into Russia. After the Russian Empire occupied the Klaipėda Region in December 1914, Jankus and his family were exiled to Samara Governorate in Siberia, where his father and his youngest son Andrius died. In 1918, Jankus returned to his homeland, where he actively promoted the idea of incorporating Lithuania Minor into Lithuania proper. In November 1918 Jankus signed the Act of Tilsit. In 1920 he was co-opted into the Council of Lithuania and later became chairman of the Supreme Salvation Committee of Lithuania Minor. In 1925 Jankus returned to live in Bitėnai.
After the Klaipėda Region was seized by Germany following the ultimatum of 1939, Jankus moved to Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. During the Nazi occupation he was forbidden to deliver public speeches. In 1944 he returned to Bitėnai and was forced to evacuate by Nazi authorities. Martynas Jankus died in Germany, but expressed his will to his daughter that his body should be burned and, when Lithuania had regained independence, his ashes should be moved to the Bitėnai cemetery.
Publisher.
During 1882–1883 Jankus published Lithuanian songs that he had collected himself. In 1883 he was one of the founders of "Aušra", the first Lithuanian-language newspaper. Jankus not only supported the publication financially, but also served as its editor. He also published "Aušros kalendorius" (1884–1885) and the newspaper "Garsas" (1886–1887). Jankus was also behind the first Lithuanian-language satirical newspaper "Tetutė". Other newspapers published by Jankus include "Naujoji Aušra" (1892), "Lietuviškas darbininkas" (1894), "Ūkininkų prietelius", "Saulėteka" (1900–1902), "Dienos lapas" (1909–1910, Jankus was an editor), "Varpas" and "Ūkininkas". Jankus himself wrote 45 books and booklets.
Printing house.
In 1889 he bought a printing house in Ragnit, which was later moved to Tilsit where it was active until 1892. Then the printing house was moved to Jankus' own house in Bitėnai, where it operated until 1909. At its peak, the house had three printing machines. It is estimated that Jankus printing house published at least 360 books and 25 periodicals. During the Lithuanian press ban in Russia, Bitėnai also served as a warehouse for illegal Lithuanian books and the "Aušra" archives. After the Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904, the printing house lost its significance and went bankrupt in 1909. The equipment was sold in 1912.
Many works by Lithuanian authors were published for the first time by Jankus. Such works included the historical novel "Senutė" by Vydūnas, over 50 booklets by Petras Vileišis, the first chapter of "Metai" by Kristijonas Donelaitis (first publication in Latin script), and other works by contemporary Lithuanian authors, including Jonas Biliūnas, Lazdynų Pelėda, Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė, Krikščiukaitis-Aišbė, and others.

Shanhai Yudi Quantu

The Shanhai Yudi Quantu is a Chinese map which was published between 1607 and 1609 in the geographical treatise "Sancai Tuhui".
Influences.
The Shanhai Yudi Quantu is known to have be highly influenced by the Jesuit missions in China, starting with the work of Matteo Ricci. Matteo Ricci himself had two of his own maps entitled "Shanhai Yudi Quantu": one engraved by Wu Zhongming (, "Wú Zhōngmíng") and dated 1600 and another engraved by Guo Zizhang (, "Gūo Zĭzhāng") and dated 1604.
Description.
Asia.
The Asian continent is marked phonetically 亞細亞 (Modern Pinyin "Yàxìyà", Middle Chinese "Aseja"). This is the area of the map where most information can be found, and has been subdivided here by regions:
East Asia.
Numerous areas and islands are named in this part of the world:
The seas beside East Asia are the South China Sea (, lit. "Great Ming Sea") and the "Lesser Eastern Ocean" (, "Xiǎo Dōng Yáng"). To the north is the "Ice Sea" (, "Bīng Hǎi").
South Asia.
Two seas are shown: the Bay of Bengal (, "Pánggélà Hǎi") and "Lesser Western Ocean" (, "Xiǎo Xīyáng").
Java is shown in two pieces Major (, "Mù Zhǎowā") and Minor (, "Xiǎo Zhǎowā") far into the "Southwest" () and "Southern" () Seas near the Antarctic.
Europe.
Europe is marked phonetically as (Modern Pinyin "Ōuluóbā", Middle Chinese "Oulapa").
Europe is surrounded by the "Greater Western Ocean" (, "Dà Xī Yáng", a body of water formerly located east of Rome and conflated with the Indian Ocean but now appropriately placed in the Atlantic), the Mediterranean (, "Dìzhōng Hǎi"), and the Black Sea (, "Tài Hǎi", lit. "Great Sea").
North America.
North America is marked as "North " (Modern Pinyin "Běi Yàmòlìjiā", Middle Chinese "Pok Amoklika"). The only location is marked phonetically and is unknown:
Another two unknown locations are located on an island to America's northeast, possibly the inhabited southwest coast of Greenland:
The Gulf of California is marked as the "Eastern Red Sea" (, "Dōng Hóng Hǎi") and the "Ice Sea" continues across the north.
South America.
South America is marked as "South " (Modern Pinyin "Nán Yàmòlìjiā", Middle Chinese "Nom Amoklika"). 
Surrounding it are the Atlantic Ocean (marked as , "Héqìngyà　Nuòchuàng") to the northeast, the "Sea of Peru" (, "Bǎilù Hǎi") to the west, and the "Great Eastern Ocean" (, "Dà Dōng Yáng").
Libya.
Following classical geography, the continent of Africa is marked phonetically as "Libya" (, "Lìwèiyà").
Africa is surrounded by several seas. From the north, clockwise: the Mediterranean; the "Lesser Western Ocean" (, "Xiǎo Xī Yáng") in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea; the Red Sea, called the "Western Red Sea" (, "Xī Hóng Hǎi") to distinguish it from the Gulf of California); the western Indian Ocean, called the "Arabian Sea" (, Modern Pinyin "Yàlàpí Hǎi", Middle Chinese "Alapbie Hsoy"); the Gulf of Guinea, called the "Libyan Sea" (, "Lìwèiyà hǎi"); and the Atlantic Ocean (again marked ).
Magallania.
The still-uncertain Terra Australis today Australia, Antarctica, New Zealand, and other islands is marked phonetically as (Modern Pinyin "Mòwǎlàníjiā", Middle Chinese "Mokngwalapneka"). This transliterates the name "Magallanica", a name given to the prospective continent at the time in honor of Ferdinand Magellan, who had crossed past Tierra del Fuego and shown the southern continent (hypothesized since Ptolemy) to be separate from South America.
The map notes how little is known about this continent "Few have reached these southern regions. Things are not explored yet" () and then ironically proceeds to include more placenames than Africa, America, or Europe:
Legacy.
A large number of maps were derived from the "Shanhai Yudi Quantu", many of them today in Korean or Japanese archives, but their history is generally difficult to reconstruct.

Naminoue Shrine

, literally "Above the Waves Shrine", is a Shinto shrine in Naha, Okinawa, Japan, the in the prefecture. It sits atop a high bluff, overlooking Naminoue Beach and the ocean.
Originally a sacred space of the native Ryukyuan religion, due to its location and natural beauty, it was dedicated to "nirai kanai", the mythical source of all life, and to the sea.　At some point it came to be known as "Hana gusuku" and "Nanminsan", 
Naminoue was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of the Ryukyu Islands. In 1890, it was recognized in the system of State Shinto. It is among the ranked, nationally significant shrines or .
History.
According to legend, it was founded after a fisherman, who had come to that spot to fish everyday, caught a mysterious stone. He began to pray to it, and began to receive better hauls in his fishing; the stone glowed, and the man treasured it. However, the gods ("kami") stole the stone, and the man fled. From then on, there was an oracle at that spot, until the time when it became known as Nanminsan. Other stories tell that the man was visited by an avatar of Kumano, who commanded the spiritual protection of the nation, and that, the man having related such to the royal government, the shrine was erected.
According to the historical document "Ryūkyū-koku yūrai-ki" (琉球国由来記, "Record of the Origin of the Kingdom of Ryūkyū), a Buddhist temple was founded on the site, to be associated with the shrine, in 1367, by Raijū, a monk from Japan's Satsuma province. This was called "Naminoue-san Gokoku-ji" (波上山護国寺, "Temple for the Protection of the Country, Naminoue Mountain").
The shrine then came to be associated with protection of the many ships coming and going from Naha's port, as Okinawa's trade with Korea, China, Japan, and regions to the south expanded. Prayers were made for safe journeys, and "kami" of the sea, of navigation and related matters were enshrined there. In addition, at the beginning of each year, the King visited the shrine and formally prayed on behalf of all the nation for good harvests and good fishing, and for the peace and prosperity of the nation. Thus, Naminoue came to be the top shrine of the kingdom. It was officially recorded as such in 1605, in "Ryūkyū Shintō-ki" (A Record of Ryūkyū Shinto) by Taichū Shōnin, a Japanese Buddhist monk.
In 1633, the shrine was destroyed by fire; and it was re-built.
Following the Meiji Restoration, the Ryūkyū Kingdom was dissolved and formally annexed by Japan as Okinawa Prefecture. The shrine was formally established as a Shinto shrine under the Imperial Household Agency in 1890, and designated as the shrine for the protection of the tranquility of all Okinawa (沖縄総鎮守社, "Okinawa sōchinshu sha"). In 1924, it was officially designated the center of religious affairs on the island. Symbols of Minamoto no Tametomo, and Ryukyuan kings Shunten, Shō En, Shō Nei, and Shō Tai were enshrined there as the primary objects of worship, as part of efforts to integrate the Ryukyuan royal line into the Japanese system of nobility and Imperial authority.
During the Sino-Japanese War (1894-5) and Russo-Japanese War (1904-5), it was common for women to come to Naminoue to pray that their sons be deemed unfit for military service to the Japanese Empire.
The shrine was destroyed in the 1945 battle of Okinawa; the "honden" (main hall) and shrine office were rebuilt in 1953, as was the worship hall ("haiden"), eight years later. Construction of a number of other buildings, including a number of smaller shrines within the grounds, was completed in 1993.

Rangers.
Bob McDermid had been at Rangers and being viewed as no longer in the plans of the Rangers management was loaned out to Dumfries club Queen of the South.
Queen of the South.
Re-vitalised by the move, McDermid found inspired form at Queens.
Along with Joe Dodds and Bob McDougall, Bob McDermid was with Queen of the South when they first joined the Scottish Football League in 1923–34 at its lowest level, the newly created Scottish Third Division. Queens finished a creditable third that season. But Queens biggest achievement that season was in the Scottish Qualifying Cup. Then considerably more prestigious than now, Queens brought the cup to the South West for the first time in its 25 year history. In the final replay a surging run through the opposition half and shot from McDermid opened the scoring. Next McDermid's 'dummy' let Bert Lister in to hit the second. McDermid's left foot finish sealed the 3-0 win and Queens were crowned cup winners. The train bringing the players and the trophy back to Dumfries were met by crowds of jubilant well wishers on the platforms and surrounding streets and approaches. The team were then entertained at the Town Hall Buildings on Buccleuch Street.
Aberdeen.
Such was Bob McDermid's form at Queens that Aberdeen moved for him in 1925. He moved to Aberdeen in what many regarded as the twilight of his career. Aberdonians advocate that it was there McDermid enjoyed the best days of his career. Mcdermid became club captain.
After retiring from playing McDermid became the club trainer.

CEIFAR

CEIFAR – Centro de Integração Familiar.
(Center for Family Integration) 
is a non-profit community project in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil in the neighborhood of Tancredo Neves. Its purpose is to better the community through education, counseling, activities and health care.
History.
Simonne Alice Debouk, a Belgian Nurse, came to Brazil in 1993 to work with adults and young adults in education and family planning. She began in the neighborhood of Trancredo Neves with family visits to promote family planning, playful-educational activities, and teaching families in the community about sexuality and improving their living conditions. was founded by Simonne in 1994 with help from friends in Luxembourg and Belgium. Working in the community, it became apparent that the lack of family planning was only one of the problems the community faced. The public education system struggled to give the children the education they needed to pull themselves out of poverty. In 1995 CEIFAR started a program of complimentary education through art, culture, and sport activities. Accessible healthcare was also a big concern for Simonne and the people in the community. In 2002 CEIFAR started a center for health on the CEIFAR site. The health center provides doctors visits, dental and orthodonture work at low cost to the people in the community. In 2005 they began a program of education for children of 3 to 6 years old and now have activities and classes for children of all ages.
School.
In the public school system in Salvador children go to school either in the morning or afternoon versus all day like many schools in the United States. This allows more children to attend the public schools. Children are required to attend school and some local governments in Brazil offer incentives to the families if their children attend school everyday. 
CEIFAR has complementary education. They also offer morning and afternoon classes but expect the child to attend public school as well as CEIFAR. If the child studies in the public school in the morning, they can study in CEIFAR in the afternoon. The children can get help with their homework from public school or often have more lessons at CEIFAR. CEIFAR also offers educational activities such as a music program, ceramics, Karate, Capoeira (a Brazilian Martial art), and sewing. Many students learn skills that help them support their families upon graduating from CEIFAR. For example, a child who advances through the Karate program can get the qualifications and experience needed to become a Karate instructor.
English classes are offered at CEIFAR for the children taught by volunteers from other countries such as the United States and England. Community English classes are sometimes offered for little or no cost for adults in the community as well. The volunteers are placed by Cross-Cultural Solutions. 
CEIFAR also provides food for the children. The children are served lunch Monday through Thursday at CEIFAR. CEIFAR is closed on Fridays for teacher planning. This insures that the children have at least one meal a day. In Brazil the largest meal of the day is lunch. Students are also required to wash their hands and brush their teeth after eating. 
CEIFAR receives help from the government who provides some of the food served. Other food is purchased or grown in the garden at CEIFAR. They also have a rainwater collection and treatment system to provide water for the school. 
CEIFAR staff members periodically do home visits to talk with the families and do what they can to not only help the children but the families as well. CEIFAR has a social worker who among other things, helps the children and families in the community obtain birth certificates and other necessary documents that weren’t obtained at birth. This is a common problem in the poorer areas in Salvador.
Health Center.
The Health Center at CEIFAR is a medical clinic that also offers pediatrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, speech therapy, psychological counseling, and dentistry. The services are offered at low cost to the community.

Endicott Estate

The Endicott Estate is a mansion built in the nineteenth century, located at 656 East Street in Dedham, Massachusetts “situated on a 15-acre panorama of lush green lawn that is punctuated by stately elm, spruce and weeping willow trees” (http://www.endicottestate.com/index.htm). It was built by Henry Bradford Endicott, founder of the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Corp. The mansion as it stands today is actually the second estate, as the original burned to the ground in 1904. This was the result of the local volunteer fire department responding to three separate fires burning at the same time, and not being able to reach the Estate in time. This event reportedly inspired Henry Bradford Endicott to build the newest Estate that same year. 
According to the Estate’s official website, “It is said that Henry Bradford Endicott took the burning of the homestead as a divine command to rebuild” (http://www.endicottestate.com/history.htm). The Estate remained in the Endicott family until 1967 after the death of Henry’s adopted daughter Katherine, when it was willed to the town of Dedham to be used for "public educational purposes, public recreational purposes, or other exclusively public purposes."
Today.
The Endicott Estate is now used to host a multitude of events, both formal and informal. This ranges from “weddings, receptions, and cocktail parties, to business meetings, art shows and more” (http://www.endicottestate.com/index.htm), such as the Annual BSAAC Antique Car Show, Car Corral & Trading Bee Family Fun Day. The mansion’s main floor houses a Grand Ballroom, which is “framed by Ionic columns and duel balustrades, adds a classical touch to holiday parties, art shows, concerts and seminars” (http://www.endicottestate.com/index.htm). The lower level of the structure is complete with a library, dining room, mirrored parlor, music room, as well as a fully functional kitchen. There are also six rooms on the upper level, which are mostly used for workshops and business meetings.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002

Buddy (2003 film)

Buddy is a Norwegian film from 2003. It was directed by Morten Tyldum after a script by Lars Gudmestad. The music was composed by Lars Lillo-Stenberg, known from the band DeLillos. The film was well received by critics, and was awarded two Amanda Awards in 2004.
Plot.
The film is about the 24-year-old Kristoffer (Nicolai Cleve Broch), who lives in Tøyen in Oslo with his friends Geir (Aksel Hennie) and Stig Inge (Anders Baasmo Christiansen). Geir likes to live dangerously, while Stig Inge is a more cautious and uncertain type. Kristoffer and Geir work as billboard hangers, and in his spare time Kristoffer makes a video diary with Geir and Stig Inge, containing stunts of a "Jackass"-nature. When Kristoffer's girlfriend, Elisabeth, leaves him, his life seems to fall to pieces. Then his videos are featured on Norway's most popular talk show, ""God morgen Norge"" on TV 2, and Kristoffer becomes famous.
Production.
The idea for the movie started with two A4 pages of text in January 2002, from which it developed quickly. The creators described it as a love declaration for the city of Oslo, a city they believed was under-represented on film. The choice of composer for the score – Lars Lillo-Stenberg – was in the same spirit; in the words of Tyldum: "He "is" Oslo".
"Buddy" received support from "Norsk Filmfond" – the Norwegian government body for film funding – on 12 June 2002. Neither the script writer, the director, the producer or the actor for the main character had worked with feature-length films prior to this project. The director, Morten Tyldum, had worked with television, music videos, commercials and short films before, and he had been named "Film talent of the year" by the newspaper "Dagbladet" in 1999, but this was his first full-length motion picture.
Reception.
"Buddy" was generally well received by the Norwegian press. The newspaper" Verdens Gang" gave it five out of six points, and remarked that in spite of a simple story, the movie was "damn well made". "Dagbladet" was less impressed, and gave the film four out of six points. The reviewer concluded that the film makers had succeeded in what they set out to do: to create an essentially "harmless" "feel-good-movie" after an American model. The movie was also released internationally, and reviewed by the American magazine "Variety". Eddie Cockrell, as opposed to the Norwegian reviewers, thought the film was "overly plotted". He found the movie to be "on the sweet side", but commended its "solid, sympathetic characterizations from the five leads".
The film was awarded two Amandas in 2004: for "Best Film (Norwegian)" and "Best Actor" (Christiansen). It was also nominated in the category "Best Screenplay". It also received the "Audience Award" and the "Most Enjoyable Film" (awarded by Theatre Owners) at the Norwegian International Film Festival, the festival where the Amandas are awarded. At the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic it won the "Audience Award" in competition with 200 other films.

Ivan Drever

Ivan Drever is a folk singer, songwriter and guitarist popular not only with the Scottish folk scene but also in other European countries such as Norway, Denmark and Spain. He often tours with popular fiddler Duncan Chisholm who founded the Celtic rock band Wolfstone which Drever joined in 1990 but left in later years. For three decades, Drever has produced a unique music sound, mixing traditional folk with some rock and roll sounds.
Life.
Drever spent his childhood as one of ten children on Sanday one of the islands of Orkney in Scotland. Interest in music was clear from a young age with Drever winning youth talent shows at 12. He enjoyed country music and Jim Reeves. In 1974 he founded the band 'Knowe O'Deil' and stayed until the late 80's. In the 90's Ivan moved to Easter Ross and joined Wolfstone. Drever spent many years in the Scottish town of Inverness which inspired many songs. His album 'Waterfront' is named after a favourite bar and restaurant there. Ivan has 4 children, including musician Kris Drever.
Career.
In 1989 he released his debut album, Homeland. In 1990 Drever joined Wolfstone where he played guitar, cittern, whistle, mandola and pipes as well as providing lead vocals and songwriting but pursued a flourishing career of solo and duo work. In 1998 Drever and Duncan Chisholm released their own album, Lewis Blue. In the early 90's Drever released a duo album with fellow Wolfstone member, Struan Eaglesham. 'Long December Night' is a recent duo album (also released as DVD) with Duncan Chisholm. Apart from his continuing collaboration with Duncan Chisholm, Drever has often joined up with other musicians, either as a duo with Bruce MacGregor, as Band with "The Vast Majority" or with former Wolfstone members Mop Youngston and Andy Murray as "The Black Sheep" in 2007. Due to Mop Yongston's illness, they could not continue touring. This project, however, has been revived as the Ivan Drever Band. The current line-up now includes Finlay Wells (bass), Iain Coates (drums) and Andy Murray (guitar). In 1998, he took a side-project from Wolfstone with the album "This Strange Place", although this album was marketed as a Wolfstone album. That same year, he and Duncan Chisholm issued their collaboration album, "The Lewis Blue".
The Ivan Drever Band.
The Ivan Drever Band is a folk-meets-rock band featuring Ivan Drever, Andy Murray, Finlay Wells and Iain Coates. They have released an EP with 5 songs: Every Beat of the Drum, Harbour Lights, Ballad of Jimmy Fry, Walk Beside Your Shoes and Stranger's Tongue. A full album, 'Sea Air', is to be released soon after their current tour of the UK and Denmark.

Eospinus

Eospinus daniltshenkoi is an extinct tetraodontid bony fish from the Eocene. Its fossils are from the Danata Formation lagerstatten of Ypresian Turkmenistan.
"E. daniltshenkoi" had four dorsal spines, three of which were on the anterior end of its dorsal side, and the first spine being placed between and below the eyes, almost like a long nose. It also had a pair of spines near the base of its caudal peduncle, and a spine in front of the anal fin.
Because this species possesses features of boxfish, triggerfish, and the extinct Spinacanthidae, "E. daniltshenkoi" can not yet be placed in a family, and is considered to be the sister taxon of triggerfish and the spinacanthids, the latter of which it bears a powerful resemblance to.

The first Mass for the parish was celebrated at Palm Beach Gardens Community High School for less than two dozen people on July 5, 1970. By 1974 there were over 600 families in the parish. Ground was broken in January of that year for a multi-purpose facility. It opened in December and served the parish for ten years. A rectory was built in 1979 and by 1982 the parish had over 2,000 households and plans were made for a new church. 
Construction for the present church was begun in 1983. While it was being built Blessed John Paul II established the Diocese of Palm Beach on June 16, 1984. St. Ignatius was chosen as the cathedral for the new diocese. The new cathedral church was dedicated by Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy on October 6, 1984. Bishop Thomas V.

Irantxe language

Irantxe (Iranxe, Iranshe), also known as Münkü (Mỹky), is an indigenous American language that is spoken in Mato Grosso, Brazil, by about 200 people. It is generally left unclassified due to lack of data. The most recent descriptions treat it as a language isolate, saying that it "bears no similarity with other language families" (Arruda 2003), though this may not be based on new data (Monserrat 2010).
The 250 Irantxe (Iránxe, Iranche, Manoki, Munku) have largely assimilated to Brazilian culture. Most are monolingual in Portuguese, and Irantxe speakers are over 50 years old. A splinter group, the Mỹky (Mynky, Münkü, Munku, Menku, Kenku, Myy), however, moved to escape assimilation, and were isolated until 1971. As of 2003, there were 38 people in the Mỹky village, but not all were ethnic Mỹky, and the others were monolingual in Portuguese. Among the Mỹky, however, the language is being passed on to children.
Monserrat (2010) is a well-reviewed grammar.
Phonology.
Monserrat posits a series of palatalized stops. For several reasons, however, reviewer D’Angelis (2011) suggests these are simply /Cj/ sequences. 
/m/ is optionally word initially, especially among the Irantxe: "muhu" [mbuhu, "mjehy" /s/ is pronounced [ʃ before /j/. and [l are in free variation.
There are 28 vowels: Seven qualities, , all appear long, short, and nasalized. The schwa, however, alternates with /ɛ/ in many words. 
Syllables may be CjVC, though words may not end in a consonant. The role of tone is not clear.

Hillside Cemetery (North Adams, Massachusetts)

Hillside Cemetery is a historic cemetery on West Main Street between Brown Street and Charles Street in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States. Located on the western fringe of the city, the earliest portions of the cemetery date to 1798; it is the community's oldest public burying ground. The cemetery is divided by Massachusetts Route 2, with the older section to the north and the younger section (laid out in 1858) to the south. The cemetery's location at the foot of Mount Greylock gives it excellent views of the surrounding area, and of the urban core of North Adams.
The older portion of the cemetery is less formally laid out than the newer section. It includes a fairly steeply sloped hill and a bowl-shaped valley, and is lined by grassy paths laid out in a grid. The oldest graves are at the top of the hill, the oldest dating to 1798. The southern portion of the cemetery is much larger, and is laid out with narrow roadways, most of which were in place by 1878. The terrain of the southern section is similar to that of the northern, also featuring a hill and valley. The most prominent memorial is the Tinker Mausoleum (1926).
The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

East Lawn Cemetery and Sherman Burbank Memorial Chapel

East Lawn Cemetery and Sherman Burbank Memorial Chapel is a historic cemetery and chapel at 605 Main Street in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Established in 1842, it is the newest and largest cemetery in Williamstown; the two older cemeteries date to the 18th century. It was established at a time when West Lawn Cemetery (established 1766) was in need of expansion, and this site was chosen for the location of a new cemetery. The initial few acres of land were donated by Asahel Foote, who sat on the committee formed to investigate the town's cemetery needs. The cemetery grew in size over the next several decades, reaching a size of about by the early 20th century. Approximately half of the cemetery (representing its developed portion) and its associated chapel were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
The Sherman Burbank Memorial Chapel was designed in 1935 by Frank Rushmore Watson in the Late Gothic Revival style, and dedicated in 1937. An associated cottage, probably intended for a caretaker, was also planned but never built. The funding for the chapel came from Sherman H. Banks of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, whose mother was from the Sherman family that was one of Williamstown's oldest. The chapel is located near the cemetery entrance, not far from Main Road. In addition to the main chapel chamber, it has a space off to one side for use as a receiving vault, and a porte cochere with a small hall and other facilities on the west side.

House of Four Doors

"House of Four Doors" is a 1968 song by the British progressive rock band The Moody Blues. Written by the band's bassist John Lodge, it was first released on the Moody Blues 1968 album "In Search of the Lost Chord". The song features John Lodge on lead vocals.
"House of Four Doors" is a two-part song that describes a group of people wandering through a forest, and finding "through the leaves" a lost path that leads to the House of Four Doors. The lyrics continue to describe the house and all its beauty. The first part of the song is track four on the album. The second part of the song, which is track six, describes the group leaving the House of Four Doors, and exclaim "You'll be lost now forever." The two parts of the song are separated by "Legend of a Mind" on the album.
"House of Four Doors" is one of the Moody Blues more complex recordings. The opening features each band member on their regular instruments, which includes Justin Hayward on acoustic guitar, John Lodge on bass guitar, Mike Pinder on the mellotron, Ray Thomas on flute, and Graeme Edge on drums. As the song progresses, more obscure instruments are used in addition to the regular instruments. The sections of the song are separated by the sound of a creaking door, which is provided by John Lodge on a cello. There is also a short harpsichord and cello duet towards the end of the song, which are played by Mike Pinder and John Lodge, respectively. The penultimate section of the song also features Mike Pinder on piano.
As the band has explained, each of the four doors that the group opens in the first part of the song reveals a different era of development in European music. The first, featuring a duet for acoustic guitar and flute, represents medieval minstrel music; the second, the harpsichord and cello duet, represents the Baroque style; the third, featuring mellotron and piano, represents classical music. The fourth door, which ends the track, is intended to represent modern rock music - which follows the opening of the door in the form of "Legend of a Mind."
"House of Four Doors" has been included on some of the Moody Blues compilation albums. When it is featured, both parts of the song are put together and included as one continuous track.

East Main Street Cemetery

The East Main Street Cemetery is a historic cemetery on East Main Street in Dalton, Massachusetts. The cemetery is one of the oldest in the town, with grave markers dating to the 1780s. It was founded on land owned by the Chamberlin family, whose identified graves make up about 20 percent of roughly 250 gravesites. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
History.
Recorded settlement of what is now Dalton, Massachusetts began in 1755, and the town was incorporated in 1784. The Chamberlin family, who where among its early settlers, owned the land along what is now East Main Street, and set aside this parcel of land as a burial ground. The oldest gravestone with a date is marked 1781; earlier burials are possible, but lack documentation and earlier gravestones may have been vandalized or stolen.
Some time in the early 19th century (definitely by 1830) the town assumed ownership of the cemetery. The cemetery was used most heavily in the mid-19th century, with usage declining in favor of the Main Street Cemetery (also listed on the National Register of Historic Places), which was laid out in the rural cemetery style that had come into fashion. In contrast, burial practices at East Main Street continued to follow the early traditions, with simple headstones and a graves laid out in relatively straight rows. The last burial at East Main Street took place in 1895. In 1887 the town was asked to consider relocating the bodies in the cemetery to Main Street, but no vote was held on the matter.
Facilities.
The cemetery is a plot of . Graves are arranged in rows emanating from a central aisle. In its early days the boundaries of the cemetery were marked by stone walls, but these were replaced in the 19th century by wood fencing, and chain link fencing in 1985. The stone gate marking the entrance is the most prominent feature of the cemetery. Most of the gravestones are modest in size and decoration; there are only five significant markers. The two largest of these flank the entrance gate, and are miod 19th century monuments for Chamberlin family members. A similarly styled monument to those two commemorates the Maynard family, while a squat obelisk in the tenth row marks graves of the Cleveland family. The most ornate marker is for James Bardin (died 1855): it has a high pedestal supporting a round column, topped by an urn and encircled by a wreath.
Most of the cemetery's stones are not in very good condition. Many have been vandalized, and a number may have been stolen, given that surveys over the years show declining numbers of stones. Many stones have become difficult or impossible to read due to weathering, and some broken stones have simply been placed further into the ground, obscuring writing on the buried portions.

Line 4 (Budapest Metro)

The Metro 4 (Officially: M4, South Buda–Rákospalota (DBR) Line, Unofficially: Green Line), currently under construction, is the fourth, or "green" line of Budapest Metro, and is expected to open in March 2014.
The first section, 7.4 km in length and consisting of ten stations, will connect the southwestern Kelenföldi pályaudvar located in Buda, and the eastern Keleti pályaudvar in Pest, under the River Danube. The second section will be an eastern extension to Bosnyák tér, while plans include a western extension to Virágpiac and further east to Újpalota. Daily ridership has been estimated at 421,000. Once in service, the line will operate using fully automated Alstom Metropolis train sets, which have already been installed on the M2 line.
Within Hungary the construction of the metro has been widely panned as a source of extensive government corruption.
History.
First plans for a fourth metro line were developed in 1972, but the track and list of the stations were finalized only in 1996. After several delays construction work started in 2004, and the first section with 10 stations is expected to open in 2014.
M4 will have a transfer point for M2 at "Keleti pályaudvar" and for M3 at "Kálvin tér" station.
Controversies.
The construction of the line has been widely criticized as slow and incompetent. Critics have panned the constant delays of evidence of widespread government corruption.
Delays.
The Budapest city government has repeatedly delayed the opening of the line. Gábor Demszky, the Mayor of Budapest from 1990 to 2010, originally promised in 1998 that the first section of the line would be open by 2003. In 2004, with the metro still unopened, he delayed the opening until 2008. In 2006, the opening was reworked to 2009; in April 2007, to 2010; in October 2007, to 2011.
In 2008, Gusztáv Klados, the line's project manager, announced that the opening would be further delayed until the end of 2011. In 2009, he stated the opening would be delayed until 2012. Later that year, Klados further delayed the opening until 2012, and one year later, in 2010, István Tarlós, Demszky's successor as mayor, pushed the likely opening back to as late as 2015.
In 2011, acting mayor Gyula Hutiray reaffirmed the 2015 completion date. Tarlós later clarified that a 2013 or 2014 opening were not outside the realm of possibility. All estimates since then have affirmed a spring 2014 opening.
Costs.
Critics have targeted the high cost of constructing and operating the line. According to estimates the first section of the M4 will have cost approximately 452 billion HUF to build alongside an annual operating cost of 6 billion HUF, which is fourfold the operating costs of the M2 and M3 combined. These funds, they claim, could have been funneled into other large-scale transportation projects such as the connection of M2 to the Gödöllõ HÉV or the construction of new tram lines. Rumors that the M4 would be the most expensive metro line ever built, however, have been rebuffed by contractors.
Route.
Critics have noted that the route to be served by Line 4 is already extensively served by a variety of tram (19, 47, 49) and bus (7, 7A, 7E, 173E) lines. The line has also been criticized for densely placed stations, some, such as Móricz Zsigmond Körtér and Újbuda-központ, within a few hundred meters of one-another. On the other hand, the city government has conducted research showing that the new line will reduce travel times on an already overused transit corridor.

Fairview Cemetery (Dalton, Massachusetts)

The Fairview Cemetery is a historic cemetery on Curtis Avenue in Dalton, Massachusetts. Established in 1885, the cemetery became the resting ground for many of Dalton's heavily Irish Catholic working class, and features more densely spaced burials than the more elaborate Main Street Cemetery. Although the cemetery is in size, it has the same number of plots as the larger (10-acre) Main Street Cemetery. The street side of the cemetery, facing Curtis Street, is lined with wrought iron fencing, and features a main gate with granite gateposts. The remaining sides of the cemetery are closed off from the surrounding neighborhood by chain link fencing. The grounds of the cemetery were designed in the fashionable rural cemetery style, with winding paths and mature plantings, although the density of plots is somewhat higher than typical. Most of the grave markers are modest in scope and scale. The cemetery continues in active use.
The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Maple Street Cemetery

Maple Street Cemetery is a historic cemetery on Maple Street in Adams, Massachusetts. The cemetery is Adams' oldest, with its earliest burials dating to 1760. It occupies a prominent place in Adams, with nearby Mount Greylock as a backdrop. Although it began as a burying ground for the community's Quakers, its use was broadened in the 19th century, and a major update of its landscape was implemented in in the late 1860s to a design by local civil engineer Charles F. Sayles. During the 1930s the cemetery infrastructure underwent some rehabilitation, and a project of the Works Projects Administration lined the cemetery roadways with locally quarried marble.
The cemetery is home to the listed Quaker Meetinghouse (built 1784), near which are the unmarked graves of Adams' early Quaker settlers. The largest and most elaborate funerary monument is that of the Plunkett family, which owned and operated some of the town's mills. A second cemetery was not laid out in Adams until 1888, when Bellevue Cemetery was established.
The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

Dalton Grange Hall No. 23

Dalton Grange Hall No. 23 was a historic Grange hall at South Street and Grange Hall Road in Dalton, Massachusetts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and demolished in 1987.
History.
The Dalton, Massachusetts Grange was founded in 1873, initially meeting in the Dalton Town Hall. Six years later the organization raised funds, received donations of materials and land, and constructed a grange hall for $300. The building was first used (in an unfinished state) in May 1879, and was formally dedicated December 10, 1879. It was the first grange hall in the state to be owned by the membership. The building became a social center in the town, and was expanded c. 1900, adding a dining hall and kitchen. A bowling alley was added at the same time. In the 20th century the hall played host to a number of civic activities and organizations. After World War II the decline in agriculture in the area led to an aging membership, and a decline in the ability to maintain the facilities. Despite appeals for assistance from the state-level grange, the building was demolished in 1987. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Lithium–titanate battery

The lithium–titanate battery is a type of rechargeable battery, which has the advantage of being faster to charge than other lithium-ion batteries. Titanate batteries are used in Mitsubishi's i-MiEV electric vehicle and Honda uses them in its EV-neo electric bike and Fit EV.
A lithium–titanate battery is a modified lithium-ion battery that uses lithium-titanate nanocrystals on the surface of its anode instead of carbon. This gives the anode a surface area of about 100 square meters per gram, compared with 3 square meters per gram for carbon, allowing electrons to enter and leave the anode quickly. This makes fast recharging possible and provides high currents when needed.
The disadvantage is that lithium-titanate batteries have a lower inherent voltage, which leads to a lower energy density than conventional lithium-ion battery technologies.
Brands and uses.
Altairnano.
Altairnano produce lithium–titanate batteries under the "Nanosafe" line, mainly for battery electric vehicles. Some vehicle manufacturers which announced plans to use Altairnano batteries includes Lightning Car Company, which plan to use them for Lightning GT, an all-electric sports car, Phoenix Motorcars, in its electric sport-utility vehicles, and Proterra, in its all-electric EcoRide BE35 vehicle, a lightweight 35-foot bus.
Altairnano has also deployed their lithium–titanate energy storage systems for electric grid ancillary services and in various military applications.
Toshiba.
Toshiba released a lithium–titanate battery, dubbed Super Charge Ion Battery (SCiB). The battery is designed to offer 90% charge capacity in just 10 minutes.
SCiB batteries are used in the Schwinn Tailwind electric bike. Toshiba has also demonstrated its use as a prototype laptop battery. Toshiba SCiB batteries are also used in Mitsubishi's i-MiEV and Minicab MiEV electric vehicles, and Honda uses them in its EV-neo electric bike and Fit EV model which will be launched in summer 2012.
Seiko.
Seiko uses lithium titanate batteries in its recent Kinetic (automatic quartz) wristwatches. Earlier Kinetic watches used a capacitor to store energy but the battery gives larger capacity and longer service life. It can be replaced easily by a technician when its capacity eventually deteriorates to an unacceptable level.
YABO.
YABO Power Technology released lithium titanate battery on 2012. The standard model YB-LITE2344 2.4V/15Ah battery cell have been used on electric vehicle and energy storage systems.

Baca Kurti Gjokaj

Baca Kurti Gjokaj (around 1807-1881) was an Albanian freedom fighter who distinguished himself as one of the best commanders of Cuna Mula in the Battle of Ržanica.
Gjokaj was born around 1807 in the village of Milješ (Milesh) in Gruda near the town of Tuzi, to an Albanian Malësor family. He was a nationalist of the Albanian revolt for independence. He rebelled against the unjustified decision of the Congress of Berlin to hand over the northern Albanian regions of Hoti, Gruda, Ulcinj, Trieshi, Plav-Gusinje etc. to Montenegro. Gjokaj was a member of the League of Prizren. When Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro and his army stepped foot on the Albanian land (which had been given to him by the Congress of Berlin) Baca Kurti heard gunshots from an extreme point in Malësia, and he and other men of Malësia organized a resistance against the Principality of Montenegro.
He opposed the selling of Albanian land for a European Diplomacy deal. Baca Kurti and other Malësors of Northern Albania fought and defeated the Montenegrins in the battles of Ržanica and Helm. These words he said towards his fellow natives for the protection of the Rrzhanica Bridge in Malësia, against the Montenegrin army:
He mobilized not only the members of his clan, but also the members of other towns of Malësia, to fight against the Montenegrin army and to have the Montenegrins leave Albanian territory: all males from 7 to 70 years old, united, forced the Montenegrin forces to retire. Today he is known to Albanians worldwide as many songs and poems were created in his honor.

Combine demolition derby

A combine demolition derby is a demolition derby in which combine harvesters are used. Several fairs in the United States feature demolition derbies using combines, including events in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, North Dakota, and Washington. 
Derbies sometimes last for up to three hours. Competitors typically remove heavy or unneeded parts of the combines before competitions and reinforce the front, or header, of the vehicle. A vehicle is deemed eliminated once its header section is destroyed or the combine is immobilized. Competitors attempt to use the header to pop other vehicle's tires, rupture their drive belts, or tear off their header. The competitions can end in ties if the only remaining machines become inextricably tangled together. The competition in Lind, Washington often includes multiple heats, including rounds for event veterans, rookies, and consolation rounds for losers. In Michigan, there is a derby circuit with competitions in several towns.
Competitors use old worn-out combines for the competitions; the use of new combines would be prohibitively expensive. Many, but not all, of the contestants are farmers. Some of the combines used date from the 1960s. The vehicles used in competition often are tall and weigh up to . Some competitions enforce rules about the height of the header, tire standards, age of the contestants, and the location and contents of the gas tank. Most combines are given colorful nicknames by their owners. Many combine owners elaborately decorate their combines. Prizes are sometimes awarded for most impressively decorated combine. Though some competitions offer prizes of $1,500, it is expensive to modify and maintain the combines and some winners lose money overall.
Though the events are usually safe, during the 1999 event in Lind, one competitor suffered a broken leg after falling from his combine. This event led to more rules being enforced at the event, including a prohibition on concrete filled headers.

Steer Clear

Steer Clear were a pop punk five piece band from Belfast, Northern Ireland that played gigs from 2005 to 2009.
History.
The original line up consisted of Mark McGowan, Pearse Sharratt, Pádraig 'p0d' McAlister, James 'Sib' McAuley and Vinny Feeney. They released their first EP, "Dog in a Bath", in 2005, recorded in Einstein Studios. Due to both personal and musical differences Pearse left and Ciarán Bartlett took over as lead vocalist, fitting in perfectly with the bands new style. The band released another EP in 2006, "Fairytales That I Despise", recorded in Manor Park Studios. Again, Steer Clear lost their vocalist, to be replaced by Dave O'Gorman. After entering the Blast:beat competition,they reached the national finals but came in 4th. Blastspace still showed interest and signed Steer Clear. Due to musical differences Dave left Steer Clear and p0d was talked into taking over lead vocals for the recording of their first full length album, "No...You Hang Up".
They then decided to get a keyboardist for live performances, and after many applicants finally found Simon Craig, who gelled with the band almost straight away and helped create Steer Clear's unique sound.
Steer Clear had created a big fan base in Ireland and landed big support slots with Enter Shikari, Good Charlotte, Set Your Goals, Elliot Minor, Paramore, Anti Flag and InMe. These slots got Steer Clear to a wider audience and a wider fan base.
In reviewing a 2007 concert in Belfast, the BBC wrote, "There is a purity to the pop hooks that sets Steer Clear apart from the emo also-rans."
They released their first single, "Please Be My Girlfriend Again" and their debut album, "No...You Hang Up" soon after.
Steer Clear played in South By South West in Texas in 2008. They were well received at the festival, and were described as "the next big thing", based on the merits of their performance at the festival.
Steer Clear released the second single from their album, "Comebacks Aren't Your Thing" on 4 July 2008. They recorded a video for it in Bolton. [http://youtube.com/watch?v=56FU5X2dkEU]
From 7–14 July 2008, Steer Clear were all locked in a two-room secret location in Dublin, with only a practise and chill out room. They had certain tasks they had to fulfill if they wanted food, such as singing for their supper and writing a song a day. They were not allowed to leave the building. There was a 24-hour webcam and fans had to guess where the secret location was for a chance to win prizes and a chance to see them perform their new songs in The Lock In. The website received 50,000 hits in the first three days.
The band's concert at The Academy in Dublin in July 2008 was a sellout. They then were heading to Britain for a series of concerts, now with a management team, From Here To The Pier, that is based in Liverpool.
In September 2008, Vinny (guitarist) left the band and Conor Ebbs, the new guitarist was introduced to the public.
Break-up.
The band split up in November 2008, posting a final blog on their MySpace page. They said,
"Basically we always had the attitude that the band should be fun and the second it stopped being fun is the second we stop playing. We want to leave the band in a place in our hearts and memories as something we enjoyed, something we loved doing and something that we learnt from and grew up with."
p0d and Ebbs went on to form the band Jody Has A Hitlist in early 2009.
Mark and Sib went on to form the band "I Fight Crime" with Rakan and Newg from local band "Boy Turns Hero", but Sib left soon after and the band broke up during autumn 2009.
p0d and Ebbs' new band released a 6 track EP including Steer Clear's track "Comebacks Aren't Your Thing".

Beugniot lever

The Beugniot lever ("Beugniot-Hebel") is a mechanical device used on a number of locomotives to improve curve running. It was named after its inventor Edouard Beugniot.
Overview.
Around 1860, when Beugniot was the chief engineer at the firm of Köchlin, he developed a system whereby wheelsets are housed in pairs in the locomotive frame, with side-play, and connected by a lever. These levers are fixed to the frame in the centre and thus enable the sideways movement of the connected axles in opposite directions. In this way, instead of being fixed in the frame, the axles are able to move sideways rather like a bogie, but clearly nowhere near as much. On locomotives with a side rod drive, the axle side-play is balanced using longer coupling pins ("Kuppelzapfen") on which the coupling rods are also able to move sideways.
Operation.
On running round a bend, the first axle is pushed sideways by the curve of the rails and so moves the second axle parallel to it in the opposite direction, until the wheel flanges of both axles align with the rails. This distributes the guide forces between the two axles which reduces wear and tear on the wheel flanges. By enabling this transverse movement of the wheelsets, locomotives with rigid frames do not have to use the thinner wheel flanges etc. normally needed to facilitate smooth running through points, bends and tightly curved sections of track. The 'guide length' of the locomotive is formed by the distance between the two fixed Beugniot lever pivot points.
Examples.
In Germany, Beugniot levers were used mainly in the middle of the 20th century. The best known examples of locomotives that use this type of lever are the MaK side-rod drive locomotives, the Class 105 and 106 engines in East Germany as well as steam locomotives like the DB Class 82.

Christ Episcopal Church (Waltham, Massachusetts)

Christ Church is a historic Episcopal church at 750 Main Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. The church is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, and was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
The church was founded in 1848, but a local hall was used for services until a wooden church was built in 1849. The wooden structure eventually proved inadequate and a larger church designed by Peabody and Stearns was built of local fieldstone at the current location between 1897 and 1898.
The church contains stained glass windows produced by several noteworthy manufacturers, including Clayton and Bell, Charles Connick, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and Donald MacDonald. Eight rectors have served the church since its founding.
History.
The community of Christ Church was founded in 1848 by Albert C. Patterson, an Episcopal clergyman and missionary who identified the growing industrial city of Waltham as an ideal place to build a church. The new Episcopal community met in Rumford Hall (later Waltham City Hall) until a Gothic wooden church was completed on Central Street in Waltham in 1849. The land for the church and much of its funding was provided by founding member J.S. Copley Greene.
Christ Church's first rector was the Rev. Thomas F. Fales, from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brunswick, Maine. Fales remained the church's rector for more than 40 years, until retiring in 1890. During this time, Christ Church's membership grew from 15 members to more than 400.
At about the time Fales retired, the church outgrew the Central Street building. In 1892, the parish bought land with the intent of building a larger church at 750 Main Street. In 1895, the old church building was sold to a French Canadian Roman Catholic community. Christ Church held services in Waltham's Maynard Hall until the new building could be completed.
In 1896, after four years of planning, the architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns was hired to design the new structure and construction began in the early months of 1897. Philanthropist and Christ Church senior warden Robert Treat Paine, Jr. signed the contract for construction, and financed much of the building with his own fortune. Philanthropist sisters and Christ Church parishioners Harriet Sarah and Mary Sophia Walker also contributed significantly to the funding.
The first service in the completed building was held on June 17, 1898. That Sunday, the retired Rev. Fales delivered the church's inaugural sermon from the wooden pulpit that was his gift to the new building.
The church is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, and was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
Architecture and design.
Christ Church was designed by Peabody and Stearns, masters of American Shingle style architecture, and was constructed of native Waltham fieldstone in the English Country style. The inspiration for the church's stone exterior came indirectly from architect H. H. Richardson, who was also a friend and Harvard classmate of Robert Treat Paine, Jr. When Paine remodeled and expanded his Waltham home in 1883, it was Richardson who designed the residence that would become Stonehurst, a Shingle style mansion built of glacial stones quarried on site from Paine's estate. Richardson died in 1886 and played no part in the planning of Christ Church, but it was his Stonehurst design that inspired Robert Treat Paine, Jr. to use the same stones from his property for the exterior of the church.
The church features several stained glass windows of significance. The east window, by Clayton and Bell, was a gift from Robert Treat Paine, Jr. in memory of his wife, Lydia Lyman Paine, who died in 1897 during the construction of the church. At Paine's request, his wife's likeness was incorporated into the left panel of the window as a red-clad figure kneeling before Christ. The west window, designed by Charles Connick, pays homage to Waltham's manufacturing history. In addition to images of Ruth, Solomon, and Noah — all industrious figures in the Bible — the window features rivets, a bicycle wheel, a watch escapement, a Metz car, and other symbols that reference Waltham's industrial character. Along the south wall is a signed Tiffany window, designed by Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson. The window depicts the Nativity, and was given to the church in 1908 by John H. Storer in memory of Frank Henry Perkins and Mary Ella Perkins. Also along the south wall is a window by noted Boston stained glass artist Donald MacDonald. This work, given in memory of Harriet K. Parmenter, depicts the Easter scene of the risen Christ revealing himself to Mary Magdalene.

USS LST-340

USS "LST-340" - later known as USS "Spark" (IX-196) - was a that served with the U.S. Navy during World War II. "LST-340" served in the Pacific theatre and, despite suffering severe damage from the enemy, was awarded three battle stars for her action in dangerous areas. She was declared too damaged to return to the States, so she was then reassigned as a barracks ship at Saipan. 
Laid down in Virginia.
The third ship to be so named by the Navy, "Spark" was laid down as "LST-340" on 17 July 1942 by the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia; launched on 8 November 1942; and commissioned on 26 December 1942.
World War II service.
Assigned to the Pacific theatre.
"LST-340" held her shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay from 9 January to 3 February 1943 when she returned for a short yard period. She sailed to New York City on the 16th and departed there on 9 March in a convoy which called at Guantanamo Bay on the 16th and sailed the next day for the Panama Canal Zone. She arrived at Coco Solo on 21 March and transited the Panama Canal on the 28th. The LST remained at Balboa until 2 April when she got under way with 11 other LST's, comprising LST Flotilla 5, for the Society Islands. The flotilla arrived at Bora Bora on 24 April and headed for New Caledonia the following week.
Solomon Islands operations.
"LST-340" arrived at Noumea on 11 May and remained there until early June. She loaded army troops and sortied on 6 June with Task Group 32.3 for the Solomon Islands. The ship was off Kokum Beach, Guadalcanal, from 9 to 16 June. 
Severely damaged by aircraft.
At approximately 1350 hours on the 16th, she was attacked by nine Japanese dive bombers. Three of the planes attacked the ship immediately, dropping nine bombs in sticks of three. One plane that attacked from the port side registered two near misses with 300-pound bombs that landed about 50 feet off her starboard side and one direct hit on her main deck. Another attacked from the port bow, strafing the bow guns as it bored in and leaving over 100 holes in her port side.
The bomb explosion killed one gun crew member and nine Army passengers, wounded four sailors, and wreaked havoc with the ship itself. All communication and electrical systems were knocked out; much of the main deck was completely wrecked; the officer's quarters were gutted by fire; the galley was damaged beyond repair; there was burning fuel in the engine room; and there was no water with which to fight the fires. All troop passengers and all of the ship's complement, other than gun crews and repair parties, abandoned ship.
The LST was beached at Tenaru Beach, and the fires were brought under control four hours later with aid from . "LST-340" was towed to Espiritu Santo for what repairs could be made. On 25 October, she sailed for California and a complete yard overhaul. The ship arrived at San Francisco, California, on 24 November 1943 and remained in the yard until April 1944.
Mariana Islands operations.
Seaworthy again, "LST-340" stood out of San Francisco on 25 April 1944 bound for Hawaii. She arrived at Maalaea Bay on 4 May and was assigned to the Northern Attack Force, Task Force 52, for the assault on the Mariana Islands.
The tank landing ship was moored at West Loch, Pearl Harbor, on 21 May, in the midst of other LST's that were loading ammunition for the invasion. At approximately 1505 hours, two LST's ( and ), moored immediately ahead of "LST-340", blew up. The "340" was underway and backing down within five minutes and, as she had lines to ships on either side, pulled them to safety as destruction spread among the closely moored ships. When the explosions ceased and the fires were extinguished, six LST's and three LCT's had been sunk with heavy casualties. Over 160 men had been killed, and almost 400 had been wounded.
Tinian operations.
"LST-340" was off Tinian during the assault on that island. On 21 June, she was unloading trucks and embarking wounded at White Beach #2. Heavy rains and high winds whipped the water, and the sea rolled in extremely heavy swells. When the ship attempted to retract from the beach, she was caught by the wind and swells and broached, suffering heavy damage. 
There was a leak around the starboard shaft, which was five inches out of line; the auxiliary engine room was leaking and had two feet of water in it; the main engine room was flooded beyond control; six other compartments were ruptured; some compartments were holed through the bottom; the midships fresh water tanks were punctured; and the auxiliary engine room had a four-foot coral head protruding up through the bottom about 10 inches. 
Conversion to barracks ship.
The LST was refloated on 13 August and towed to Tanapag Harbor, Saipan. On 15 August, the ship was inspected and found to be damaged beyond repair. Plans were made to convert her into a barracks ship at Tanapag.
"LST-340" was reclassified as "IX-196" and named "Spark" on 20 October 1944. 
Post-war decommissioning.
"Spark" was decommissioned on 24 October 1944 and struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1945.
Awards.
"Spark" received three battle stars for World War II service for her services in the Solomon Islands, Mariana Islands, and at Tinian.

Crowdecote (sometimes spelled Crowdicote) is a small village nestling on the border between Derbyshire and Staffordshire about south of Buxton. It is part of Hartington Middle Quarter civil parish. It is thought that the name Crowdecote derives from "Cruda’s Cot" (Cruda was a Saxon landowner while 'cot' meant a form of shelter). Because of its location close to the spectacular Chrome Hill, High Wheeldon and Parkhouse Hill to the north and Dovedale to the south, Crowdecote is popular with walkers and ramblers.

Western Oblast

Western Oblast (, "Zapadnaya Oblast") was an "oblast" (a first-level administrative and municipal unit) of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1929 to 1937. Its seat was in the city of Smolensk. The oblast was located in the west of European Russia, and its territory is currently divided between Bryansk, Kaluga, Pskov, Smolensk, and Tver Oblasts.
By the 1937 All-Union Census, the population of the oblast was 4,693,495 persons. It was abolished on September 27, 1937.
History.
The oblast was established on October 1, 1929 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. The territory of the krai was formed from Smolensk and Bryansk Governorates, parts of Moscow, Kaluga, and Tver Governorates, as well as Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. The oblast was subdivided into eight administrative districts ("okrugs"),
Before the oblast was established, the constituent governorates used the old division inherited from the Russian Empire (uyezds). On October 1, 1929 the division of the oblast into districts was established.

Northern Oblast (1936–37)

Northern Oblast (, "Severnaya Oblast") was an "oblast" (a first-level administrative and municipal unit) of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1936 to 1937. Its seat was in the city of Arkhangelsk. The "oblast" was located in the north of European Russia and its territory is currently divided between Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Kostroma and Kirov "oblasts" and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug.
Before 1936, the area occupied by Northern Oblast was part of Northern Krai, a vast administrative unit comprising the north of Russia. The 1936 Soviet Constitution abolished Northern Krai and divided its territory between the Komi Republic and the new Northern Oblast. Northern Oblast included 54 districts, three of which were in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In 1937, the Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts. In 1941, three of its districtsLalsky, Oparinsky and Podosinovskywere transferred from Arkhangelsk Oblast to Kirov Oblast. Pavinsky and Vokhomsky District became a part of Kostroma Oblast.

Early life and education.
Born in Indianapolis, Indiana to William and Georgia Teare, his father was an employee of International Harvester and a member of UAW Local 226 and his mother a newspaper woman who worked at The Indianapolis Star-News and The Nothside Topics.
He attended Culver Military Academy, Ball State University, Indiana University and Bard College.
Art and Music.
Though a visual artist first and foremost, Teare has participated in several musical projects. In 1975/76 he played drums in the seminal proto-punk band, MX-80 Sound. In New York he also played with the performance artist Julia Heyward in Glo-National in 1981. In 1991-93 he performed with Brian Kelly, Julia Murphy and Pat Place, the material that would later be titled "Brian Kelly :Each Day Blues" a CD produced by Julian Schnabel. His drumming can also be heard on Kelly's composition "She Is Dancing" for the soundtrack of the 1996 film Basquiat by Schnabel.
In 1999, Teare released "The List Of Who Lives" a collection of self penned songs featuring guest performances by Jay Dee Daugherty (Patti Smith Group), Wayne Kramer (MC5), Richard Lloyd (Television) as well as Bob Neuwirth, Terence Stamp and Jeni Muldaur. The List Of Who Lives was voted "one of the three or four best self produced albums of the millennium" by MOJO Magazine and received The A&R Album Of The Week by CMJ.
Curating.
In 2012 Teare curated Open For The Stones, Vol. 2 at Harper's Books in East Hampton, N.Y.. The exhibition's theme was: visual artists who have had a significant relationship to music.
The exhibition included works by Larry Clark, Angel Corpus Christi, Don Christensen, Bethany Fancher, Daniel Johnston, Liz Markus, Gillian McCain, Ron Nagle, Lou Reed, Stuart Sutcliffe and others.
Open For The Stones, Vol.1, the first in a series of group exhibitions opened in New York at Julie Keyes Art Projects in 2011. Participating artists included Tara Israel, Bob Neuwirth, Pat Place and Chris Snow.

These were shown at The Indianapolis Museum of Art and at 55 Mercer Gallery in New York at the behest of the sculptor Julius Tobias. In 2007 they were exhibited at The Islip Museum of Art for the "Surface Impression" show curated by Karen Shaw. Starting in the early 80's his work took a decidedly more political turn calling on his use of military and world history and utilizing symbols, flow charts and cartography as part of the painted compositions. The earliest of these works were shown in 1982 at P.S.1 in an exhibition curated by Marcia Tucker called: "Critical Perspectives".

Movima language

Movima is a language that is spoken by about 1,400 (nearly half) of the Movima, a group of Native Americans that resides in the LLanos de Moxos region of the Bolivian Amazon, in northeastern Bolivia. It is considered a language isolate, as it has not been proven to be related to any other language.
Phonology.
Movima has five vowels:
The plosive is realized as in the syllable onset but as (which contrasts with the simple nasal phoneme ) in the coda. Similarly, and are realized as and (i.e., as a glottal stop with a vocalic release), respectively, in the syllable coda. In vowel-initial words and between adjacent vowels, an epenthetic glottal stop appears.
The phonemes and are only present in Spanish loanwords.
Morphology.
In Movima, compounding and incorporation are productive derivational processes. Reduplication and affixation, including some processes (such as the irrealis marker "(k)a"') that resemble infixation, are also common. Typical examples of inflection, such as number, case, tense, mood, and aspect, are not obligatorily marked in Movima. Many derivational processes can be applied to a single Movima word. The same morpheme may appear multiple times in one word this way, for instance, "tikoy-na-poj-na" "I make X kill Y."

Calatrava la Nueva () is a medieval castle and convent found on the peak of Alacranejo, within the municipality of Aldea del Rey, near Almagro, in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain.
Its name is a reference to the Order of Calatrava, which was originally situated in Calatrava la Vieja, 60 km to the north. In 1217, the Order of Calatrava moved to Calatrava la Nueva. Thus, the original site became known as "Calatrava la Vieja" ("Old Calatrava") and the new site as "Calatrava la Nueva" (“New Calatrava”).

Om (The Moody Blues song)

"Om" is a 1968 song by the British progressive rock band The Moody Blues. It was composed by the band's keyboardist Mike Pinder. "Om" has a heavy Indian influence and sound to it. 
"Om," which is chanted repeatedly throughout the song, represents Aum, a sacred mantra in the Hindu, Jain and Buddhist religions.
"Om" is the final track on the Moody Blues 1968 album "In Search of the Lost Chord". On the album, "Om" is preceded by a short spoken-word interlude named "The Word". "The Word" was written by drummer Graeme Edge, and is recited by Mike Pinder. "The Word" explains the album's concept, and that the mantra "Om" is the lost chord referenced in the album's title, which concludes with:
"To name the chord is important to some."
"So they give it a word,"
"And the word is "Om""
While "The Word" and "Om" are generally played together, "The Word" was released on The Moody Blues 1974 compilation "This Is The Moody Blues" without "Om." However, the final word of "The Word", which is also the first word of "Om", was included.
Like many of the album's preceding tracks, "Om" make use of a variety of different instruments. "Om" features both Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas on lead vocals, and on their usual instruments, the mellotron and the flute, respectively. The remaining band members are featured on instrument other than their usual instruments, which includes Justin Hayward on sitar, John Lodge on cello, and Graeme Edge on tabla, a popular Indian percussion instrument used in the classical, popular and devotional music of the Indian subcontinent and in Hindustani classical music. 
"Om" has a very similar influence and sound to The Beatles' 1967 song "Within You Without You," which was written by George Harrison, and included on their 1967 album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".

José Chávez Morado

José Chávez Morado (January 4, 1909 – December 1, 2002) was a Mexican artist associated with the Mexican muralism movement of the 20th century. He was of the generation after that of Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Although Chávez Morado took classes in California and Mexico, he is considered to be mostly self-taught. He experimented with various materials, and was one of the first Mexican artists to use Italian mosaic in monumental works. His major works include murals at the Ciudad Universitaria, Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes and Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City as well as frescos at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas which took twelve years to paint. From the 1940s on, he also worked as a cultural promoter, establishing a number of cultural institutions especially in his home state of Guanajuato including the Museo de Arte Olga Costa - José Chávez Morado, named after himself and his wife, artist Olga Costa.
Life.
Chávez Morado was born on January 4, 1909 in Silao, Guanajuato, one year before the start of the Mexican Revolution. He was the son of merchant José Ignacio Chávez Montes de Oca and Luz Morado Cabrera. He came from a modest family; however, his grandfather was in possession of a private library of over 5,000 volumes which had been collected by his grandparents and great grandparents. His first exposure to art was through the illustrations in these book and when he was small, he spent time copying them, especially illustrations from La Ilustración Española.
His mother died when he was a teenager, and at age 16, he began to work at the Compañia de Luz (electric company) in Silao. However, he lost this job when he drew a caricature of his boss. He then went to work at Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México, or the national railroad company which allowed him to travel some of the Mexican countryside. In 1925, the emigrated to the United States, where he worked on citrus farms in California and even went to Alaska to work in salmon fishing on the island of Tonepek. During this time he still drew, mostly likenesses of his coworkers. He returned to California from Alaska, taking various jobs to be able to take classes at the Chouinard School of Arts. At this time he met José Clemente Orozco who was painting the mural “Prometeo” at Pomona College.
In 1930, he returned to Silao. His father gave him a store to run. At the counter, he would draw images of the customers and other typical people, which he sold when the store went under and he moved to Mexico City. He entered the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (now the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas, associating with the more politically active artists on the left. He took engraving classes with Francisco de León, painting with Bulmaro Guzmán and lithography with Emilio Amero. At the Centro Popular de Pintura “Saturnino Herrán” he met Leopoldo Méndez, whose posters he had taken from the streets to decorate his room.
He also met Olga Costa, who was born in Leipzig, Germany the daughter of Russian émigré musician Jacob Kostakowsky. They married in 1935.
During his art career, Chávez Morado was politically active as a member of the Mexican Communist Party and with a number of communist and socialist artists’ groups.
In 1949, he studied abroad in Europe and Cuba.
In his later life, he and his wife resided for a time in San Miguel de Allende, then moved permanently to the city of Guanajuato in 1966 They became avid collectors of Mexican handcrafts and folk art, archeological pieces, books and plants. They also sponsored numerous cultural events until his death.
In 1975, he and his wife decided to donate their collection of pre Hispanic art to the Museo Regional de la Alhóndga de Granaditas and their collection of colonial and folk art to the Museo del Pueblo in Guanajuato.
Chávez Morado died on December 1, 2002 at the age of 93 of respiratory failure. His funeral was at the Museo del Pueblo. At the time of his death, he was considered to be the “last of the Mexican muralists.”
Career.
Chávez Morado was a painter, engraver, muralist and cultural promoter during his career. He also worked to support educational institutions in the state of Guanajuato.
He established his art career in the 1930s, starting by teaching drawing classes in primary and secondary schools in 1933. He was named chief of the Fine Arts Section of the Department of Fine Arts of the Secretaría de Educación Pública in 1935, and later gave classes in drawing at the Escuela de Pintura y Escultura of the SEP in the 1940s. He also was a professor of lithography at the Escuela de Artes del Libro. His students included Felipe Ehrenberg and Luis Nishizawa . He also did illustration work early in his career such as six linoleum engravings for the "Vida nocturna de la Ciudad de México" book by Ediciones de Arte Mexicano.
He main work as an artist was the creation of murals. His first public work was a mural called "La lucha antiimperialista!" At the Teachers’ College in Xalapa, Veracruz in 1935. Other early murals include one for the Multifamiliar Doctores of the ISSSTE and the Teachers’s College in Guadalajara, both of which were created with glass pieces. Starting in 1952, he created three murals at the Ciudad Universitaria of UNAM in Mexico City called "El regreso de Quetzalcóatl" (The return of Quetzalcoatl), "La conquista de la energía" (The conquest of energy) and "La ciencia y el trabajo" (Science and work). All are in the Alfonso Caso Auditorium with the first two made of glass pieces. "El retorno de Quetzalcoatl" and "La conquista de la energia" are outside of the usual social and political themes of his work, but with "La ciencia y el trabajo", he returned to examining social issues, this time in relation to the building of the Ciudad Universitaria itself. It is not popular with those at the university but it is with foreign tourists. It shows how the farm workers of the expropriated haciendas were used in the construction of the university as well as the architects and engineers who designed it, as well as the Van de Graaff generator with was a centerpiece of the university in the 1950s. This last work was created on the vestibule of the Auditorium with a vinyl substance. Its location has made this piece subject to damage from humidity and vandalism. In 1954, he created mosaic murals for the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes building, made of tile and colored stone. From 1955 to 1967 he painted fresco murals inside the Alhóndigas de Granaditas. This work was partially funded by fundraising drive resulting in 250,000 Mexican schoolchildren donated twenty cents each. In 1964, he painted panels with Mesoamerican themes for the Museo Nacional de Antropología.
Chávez Morado’s work in cultural promotion began in the 1940s. He founded and directed the Espiral Gallery and was a founding member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. In 1948 he was a founding member of the Sociedad para el Impulso de las Artes Plásticas and two years later founded the Taller de Integración Plástica. In 1951, he designed scenery and costume for the ballet performances called La manda and El sueño y la presencia. He established a number of museums in his home state of Guanajuato including the Alhóndigas de Granaditas Regional Museum, Casa del Arte José y Tomás Chávez Morado in Silao, the José Chávez Morado Library at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (donating his own personal collection of art books) and the Museo de Arte Olga Costa - José Chávez Morado. The last is located at a farm which was part of a larger 17th century hacienda in the house they used to live in. Inaugurated in 1993, the museum´s ground floor contains the permanent collections with includes furniture, ceramics, glass, plaster of paris, altarpieces, masks and more. It also includes an important collection of over 500 pre Hispanic pieces. It also includes over seventy pieces by Chávez Morado and Olga Costa.
During his career, Chávez Morado was involved in leftist politics, which affected the art he produced. In the 1930s, he joined the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios. The Liga edited a print album called Estampas del Golfo with ten of his wood engravings. In 1937, he traveled as part of a committee of Mexican intellectuals which included Silvestre Revueltas, Juan de la Cabada, Octavio Paz, Carlos Pellicer, Elena Garro and José Mancisidor to Spain to support the Republicans. In 1938, he joined the Taller de la Gráfica Popular, leaving in 1941. In 1941, he collaborated with La Voz de México, drawing cartoons under the name of Juan Brochas. He used the pseudonym of Chon to make illustrations for the weekly “Combate” headed by Narciso Bassols. In early 1942, he published four editions of a newspaper/poster called El Eje-Le, which was a publication of the Artistas Libres de México. In the 1940s, he was the secretary general of the Fine Arts Professors’ Union, which made non-commercial engravings with socialist messages to paste on poles outside. They had to do this activity at night as they were subject to attack by reactionaries such as the Camisas Doradas (Golden Shirts).
Later work included the reliefs on the column of the “umbrella” structure in the center of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in 1964, a monument to Benito Juárez on the Guadalajara-Colima highway in the 1970s, and the copper grilling on the facade of the new Legislative Palace in Mexico City.
His artistic legacy consists of over 2,000 works, which includes murals, other monumental works, etchings, paintings and more. His first exhibition was in 1944 at the Galería de Arte Mexicano. After that, they were shown at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico as well as abroad. In 1976, he exhibited his drawing work for the first time at the José Clemente Orozco Gallery in Zona Rosa, with the title of "Apuntes de mi libreta", which were later published in a book of the same name. His works can be found in the collections of the Museo de Antropologia, UNAM, Centro Médico Siglo XXI, the Alhóndiga de Granaditas, Museo del Pueblo, the Olga Costa Chávez Morado Museum, Museo de los hermanos Tomás y José Chávez Morado and in private collections around the world.
He received his first recognition for his work in 1945 when he won first prize at a graphics competition sponsored by the Mexico City government for the 25th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution. In the 1950s, he began to receive accolades and appointments to art commissions. He received the Premio Nacional de Arte from the Mexican government in 1974. In 1985, he was admitted into the Academia de Artes and received an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. He was also the vice president for Latin America of the World Crafts Council of UNESCO and a member emeritus of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte . His last homage while he was alive was at the Festival Internacional Cervantino. A retrospective of his work was hosted in Cadiz in 2012 on the 10th anniversary of his death.
Artistry.
Chávez Morado created engravings, illustrations, cartoon drawings, sculpture, murals, canvas painting, frecos, bronze, glass, and was one of the first Mexican artists to work with Italian mosaic on monumental works. Although he had some training in California and Mexico, he is considered to be mostly self-taught. He was interested in experimenting with new techniques and materials for murals. His work ranged from traditional frescos to those made with vinyl, mosaics, stone, bronze and terracotta.
His work was always figurative in the style of Mexican muralism also known as the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura. He is grouped with contemporaries such as Juan O'Gorman, Raúl Anguiano and Alfredo Zalce as the generation of the school to follow Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros . Like the others, Chávez Morado promoted the social and political principals of the Mexican Revolution. He believed that art should be esthetic and political and was both politically active as well as an artist. His work emphasized faith in the masses, the exaltation of the struggle and heroes of the Mexican Revolution, popular culture and the railroad. His painting tended to emphasize the human form, with depictions of rural areas in Mexico, customs, dances and folk religion. By the mid 20th century, his politics and art became militant and communist, as can best be seen in his engravings and the work he did with the Taller de Gráfica Popular.

BioBus

Biobus is a novel concept in science education involving a bus that has been equipped as a self-contained, mobile laboratory used to educate K-12 students in biology basics. The bus may also be used for other audiences such as community organizations. Typically, a school or organization requests a visit, and the bus, staffed by scientists, arrives onsite so that it can involve students in participatory science experiments and presentations. The objective is to demonstrate to young people the fun of actual science, as opposed to textbook learning. 
The first Biobus program was created in 1999 by Georgia State University (GSU), with grant assistance from the National Science Foundation. Since its founding, the GSU Biobus has made 950 visits involving over 80,000 people. The concept has spread beyond Georgia, including New York City.

Portland Ice Arena (Maine)

The Portland Ice Arena is an ice hockey arena in Portland, Maine. Located on Park Avenue between Fitzpatrick Stadium and Hadlock Field, the Ice Arena has a seating capacity of 750 and is open 10 months of the year. Since its opening in 1984, it has been home to Portland Pirates hockey practices as well as local amateur teams and open skating hours. The facility was funded by a 20 year bond which was repaid in 2004. During the summer of 2012, the facility closed for energy efficiency repairs, which were the first major upgrades since the building opened in 1984. The repairs were funded by a $625,000 bond passed by voters in 2011 and were estimated to save the city 67,000 kilowatt-hours in energy use yearly.
Losses.
Portland operates the Ice Arena as an "enterprise fund", meaning it receives and operates a separate budget. If it runs a loss, funds are taken from the city's general fund and likewise, if it receives profits funds go into that fund. From 2001-09, the Ice Arena lost $635,000, including losses each year. In 2001, it lost nearly $120,000.

SS Oster

SS "Oster" is a Norwegian steamship built in 1908 by Christianssands Mekaniske Værksted for the Indre Nordhordlandske Dampskibsselskab. She sailed between Bergen and Osterfjorden in Norway with passengers and goods from 1908 until World War II when she was acquired as a guard ship by the Royal Norwegian Navy and later by the German Navy. After the war the vessel was in need of maintenance and modernization before she could be put back in service in 1956. As the only coal-powered steamer left in Bergen, "Oster" became a symbol of the old fjord steamers on the western coast. However, the boat was sold and rebuilt as a freighter in 1964, and the steam-engine was replaced with a more modern diesel engine. In 1996 she was bought by Nordhordland Veteranbåtlag who restored the ship back to her original state as a steam-driven passenger ship. She now sails with tourists on special occasions.

German Peruvian

A German Peruvian is a Peruvian citizen of German descent. In general, the term is also applied to descents of other German speaking immigrants, such as Austrians or Swiss. The phrase may refer to someone born in Peru of Austrian, German or Swiss descent or to someone who has immigrated to Peru from German speaking countries.
History.
Since independence Germans had been immigrating to Lima on a small scale. the first wave of immigration was in 1853, organized by then-president Ramon Castilla. These immigrants established themselves in the cities of Tingo Maria, Tarapoto, Moyobamba, and in the department of Amazonas. Barón Cosme Damián Freiherr Schutz von Holzhausen, the leader of the immigration movement, consulted with the then Peruvian Minister of Foreign Relations, Manuel Tirado. The meeting's purpose was to colonize the central jungle to better link the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The colonists would end up colonizing Pozuzo. In 1854, the first immigration contract was signed between the Baron and then-president José Rufino Echenique. The next year, in 1855, this contract was nullified as Echenique had been ousted and Ramon Castilla had assumed the presidency again. The Baron signed a new contract with the new president on December 6, 1855. According to the contract each colonist would be reimbursed by the government for the cost of the voyage from Europe to Pozuzo, the construction of a new highway from Cerro de Pasco to Pozuzo, each colonist 15 years old or older would receive 15 pesos, the distribution of land between the colonists of which they would have legal ownership, exemption for the first six months of taxes, and the responsibility to build schools, churches, and other basic needs. The government, however, required that the colonists be Catholic and workers skilled at a trade. To make this project possible the Baron was hired by the Peruvian government to oversee the colonization, paying him a salary of 2,400 pesos annually. The first wave of colonists departed Antwerp in 1857 and arrived in the Peruvian port of Callao two months later. The third wave of immigrants to the jungle occurred in 1868, taking the same route as the second wave of immigrants did. In later years, the descendants of the German immigrants would go on to found new cities throughout the central jungle such as Oxapampa and Villa Rica. 
Throughout the history of Peru, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, a substantial number of German immigrants have settled in other parts of Peru, primarily in Lima. Also, many of these German immigrants have Jewish heritage. A large part of Jewish Peruvians are of German descent.
The Peruvian population of German descent is 160,000 people, while the descendants of Austro-German migration to the area of Oxpampa Pozuzo are 25,000 people.

Frederick de Winton

Frederick Henry de Winton (19 January 1852 – 25 April 1932) was an Anglican clergyman, who was the last Missionary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford.
Frederick de Winton was born on 19 January 1852, the second son of Henry de Winton, who was Archdeacon of Brecon. He was educated at Uppingham School and Balliol College, Oxford, obtaining a second class degree in "Literae Humaniores". He was elected to a Leoline Fellowship at Jesus College, Oxford in 1876. This category of fellow at Jesus College was established by Leoline Jenkins, a former principal of the college, to provide priests to serve in "His Majesty's fleet at sea and foreign plantations", under the direction of the Lord High Admiral and the Bishop of London respectively. De Winton was the last of these fellows, since they were abolished in 1877 by the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Commission without prejudice to the rights of existing holders. He held the position until his death, by which time he had become the most senior fellow at the college. In 1879, de Winton went to Ceylon as chaplain to the Bishop of Colombo (R. S. Copleston) and, after holding various parish appointments, became Archdeacon of Colombo in 1902. He held this position until 1925. Alfred Hazel, Principal of the college at the time of de Winton's death, said that he had devoted his life to Colombo, where he was a "well-known and well-loved, if rather eccentric, figure". He retired to England and died in Bognor Regis on 25 April 1932. He never married.
