Ann Dancing

Ann Dancing is an artwork created in 2007 by Julian Opie (born 1958, London) a Welsh artist and former trustee of the Tate. The sculpture was removed from its base on August 20, 2008, for repairs, and was returned on October 31 of that year.
Description.
The sculpture consists of four rectilinear panels of light-emitting diode (LED) screens that each display the same animated image in orange of a woman on all four panels. The woman, "Ann," is wearing a sheath dress and sways from side to side in a dancing motion. Ann either has pointed feet or is wearing high-heeled shoes. She appears to have no clear hairstyle.
It is probable that the animated image of Ann dancing is computer generated from an internally housed computer located in the red brick base of the sculpture.
History and Location.
The sculpture was installed at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue, Alabama Street, and Vermont Street in Indianapolis from January to February, 2008. The sculpture is located directly in front of the Old Point Tavern and was the first artwork installed on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail at a total expense of $150,000.
The sculpture is visible in the Google Maps Street View, but only from the middle of the intersection [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=401+Massachusetts+Ave,+indianapolis&sll=42.42805,-71.200397&sspn=0.009535,0.02223&ie=UTF8&layer=c&cbll=39.772592,-86.152437&panoid=IR2fF0XWgVjQtGD-ObatlA&cbp=13,78.23,0,4.67&hq=&hnear=401+Massachusetts+Ave,+Indianapolis,+Marion,+Indiana+46204&ll=39.772692,-86.152296&spn=0.012452,0.033023&z=16].

February 1965 South Florida tornado outbreak

The February 1965 South Florida tornado outbreak was a tornado outbreak that affected the southern Florida peninsula on February 23, 1965. At least four confirmed tornadoes touched down between 10 a.m.–1 p.m. EST (15–18 UTC); the strongest tornado moved through the Fort Lauderdale area and produced F3 damage on the Fujita scale, injuring six people. In addition, a F1 tornado also moved through northern Broward and southern Palm Beach counties. Two tornadoes also affected Lee County, producing F2 and F1 damage, respectively. 50 percent of the tornadoes attained strong (F2–F3) or violent (F4–F5) intensity.
Meteorological synopsis.
The first tornado of the outbreak touched down around 10:49 a.m. EST near Coral Springs and dissipated near Delray Beach, causing intermittent, minor damage to rural areas. The second tornado touched down near Chula Vista and moved north-northeast across western portions of the city of Fort Lauderdale, affecting 40 blocks of the city. The small funnel was visible from a jetliner waiting to take off from Fort Lauderdale International Airport. Later, it briefly lifted prior to touching down in Oakland Park, and it dissipated northeast of Wilton Manors. Though three funnel clouds occurred along the path, but only one tornado developed. One home was destroyed, while seven trailers, three cars, and multiple trucks received severe damage. Most of the damage affected a marina and a trailer park, though damage to power poles left about 2,400 residents powerless. The width of the damage path did not exceed 60 yards (20 feet). The tornado caused six injuries, three of them due to airborne debris, and at least $140,000 (1965 USD) in damages. The tornado is officially estimated to have been a F3 event. It remains one of only three F3 tornadoes to affect Broward County since 1950; the others occurred on April 10, 1956, and March 1, 1980. However, at least one source disputes the rating, listing the 1965 tornado at F2 status. The third and fourth tornadoes touched down around 12:45 p.m. EST in the Fort Myers and San Carlos Park areas, respectively. The last tornado caused substantial damage to "saran cloth" housing and inflicted two injuries.
Significant storms.
In addition to tornadoes, severe thunderstorms produced strong wind gusts that damaged at least three homes near Lehigh Acres. Multiple funnel clouds occurred over at least two counties in southern Florida, and at least one waterspout touched down near West Palm Beach.

The Great Fire (novel)

The Great Fire (2003) is a novel by the Australian author Shirley Hazzard. It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and a Miles Franklin literary award (2004).
Overview.
"The New Yorker" wrote of the novel:
Hazzard is nothing if not discriminating. Hierarchies of feeling, perception, and taste abound in her writing, and this novel—her first in more than twenty years—takes on the very notion of what it means to be civilized. The fire of the title refers primarily to the atomic bombing of Japan, but also to the possibility of transcendent passion in its aftermath. In 1947, a thirty-two-year-old English war hero visiting Hiroshima during the occupation finds himself billeted in a compound overseen by a boorish Australian brigadier and his scheming wife. He is immediately enchanted, however, by the couple's children—a brilliant, sickly young man and his adoring sister—who prove to be prisoners in a different sort of conflict. In the ensuing love story, Hazzard's moral refinement occasionally veers toward preciosity, but such lapses are counterbalanced by her bracing conviction that we either build or destroy the world we want to live in with our every word and gesture.

Ashby Potters' Guild

Ashby Potters' Guild was an English studio pottery existing from 1909-1922.
The studio pottery was established in 1909 in Woodville, Derbyshire, by Pascoe Tunnicliffe (1881-1956). Tunnicliffe's father, Edwin Rowland Tunnicliffe who lived in Woodlville, had taken over a ceramics factory known as Victoria Pottery in 1897 and produced a range of utilitarian household wares. Ashby Potters' Guild was an expansion of the business intended to produce more high end decorative wares. Pascoe Tunnicliff created experimental decorative glaze effects and worked with Thomas Camm who was in charge of design.
Tunnicliffe exhibited at the International Exhibition Brussels 1910, the Turin International Exhibition 1911, the Ghent Exhibition 1913 and the British Industrial Arts Exhibition (1920).
Studio production was temporarily suspended during the first World War. In 1922 the pottery merged with the Ault Faience Pottery to form Ault and Tunnicliffe. The owner of Ault Faience Pottery, William Ault had retired and Pascoe Tunnicliffe became the Works Director. The merged company was later renamed Aultcliff and renamed again in 1937 as Ault Potteries Ltd.
Examples in Public Collections.
Ceramics by the Ashby Potter's Guild are in the collection of a number of museums including the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and locally Sharpe's Pottery Museum in Swadlincote.

Medusa Stone

Medusa Stone is a three-piece American rock band from Wilmington, North Carolina. Medusa Stone's members are Justin Fox on guitar and vocals, Worth Weaver on guitars and vocals, Jeremy Summers on drums and backing vocals, and Dave Morse on bass and backing vocals. They are often compared to The Black Crowes however recently they have been shedding that resemblance with the release of their latest album "Live Your Life".
History.
Medusa Stone started out as a band called Catfish Lane in 2002 while Justin Fox was just 16 years old. His father Terry Fox played bass while his cousin Jeremy Summers drove two hours once a week to practice with them doing mostly blues covers and a few original songs. At this time the line-up consisted of Justin Fox, Jeremy Summers and Justin's father Terry Fox. In early 2002 the band was asked to move to Wilmington, North Carolina by Strategic Artists, a management company started by Bruce Henderson and Mark Schulman that had started working with the band. Henderson wanted the band to be closer to his office and also felt that Wilmington's music scene was perfect for the young band. After a few local shows a "buzz" about the trio started to surface. Most of the "buzz" however was about Justin's young age and this created much tension for him. "I feel like I am more of a spectacle than an artist. I wish our audience could look past my age and listen to the band as a whole" said Justin in a 2002 interview with Rock 104.5. They toured well into 2003 mainly on the east coast with a relentless schedule, sometimes doing five "bar" gigs in a row playing from 10 pm to 2 am. Sometime in 2003 they recorded a ten-track demo called "Pocket Change" with six original songs and four live covers. Once again the fan response was biased, only wanting to hear covers of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix. Tension began to mount between Henderson and the band; Justin was frustrated with his reputation and wanted to change his entire image. He felt that Henderson played too heavily on his age when representing the band. Jeremy was also becoming agitated with Henderson's management and the two often argued over the direction of the band. All the while Terry's home life was suffering due to his touring schedule; he left the band in late 2003 to spend more time with his wife and younger son. Shortly after Dave Morse was offered Terry's position and opted to leave Redwood, his band at the time. Soon after Dave's entry into the band they nullified their contract with Bruce Henderson. While on tour in the U.S. Virgin Islands playing many venues and even opening for Hubert Sumlin music promoter and radio personality Bryan Hollenbaugh put the band in contact with Damon Johnson (of Brother Cane, Whiskey Falls) who had started a recording studio in his Alabama home. Shortly after the band traveled to Alabama and recorded what would become Medusa Stone's debut album.
Medusa Stone begins.
The band recorded their debut album in just ten days. The songs were compiled from a collection of some thirty songs written by Justin over the past two years. With Damon Johnson not only recording but also producing and mixing the entire project, he also found time to co-write "Whisper to Me" with Justin during the recording. They returned home to North Carolina with a new album and a new attitude; naturally a name change was needed. Justin had become bitter about Catfish Lane's reputation around town and the band did not play blues for some time. Justin later stated that he never stopped loving playing the blues, they just had to erase all ties to Catfish Lane. The trio settled on the name Medusa Stone and began marketing their new image and album. There was only one problem: they were broke. Dave and Justin were living in a house in downtown Wilmington where they reportedly lived off of ramen noodles and hot dogs. Often they were so broke that the two would throw huge parties just to drink for free and collect all of the cigarette butts the next day so Dave could roll the unsmoked tobacco into cigarettes. At this time it is said that Jeremy pushed Dave and Justin to work harder and book the gigs that they needed. With a renewed work ethic the trio hit the road once again to promote the new album and toured the east coast. They also had the chance to open up for Sonny Landreth, David Lee Roth, Mother's Finest and Damon Johnson's band at the time Slave to the System, ending the tour with another stop in the U.S. Virgin Islands where the new album was very well received and even enjoyed nominal airplay. The band returned home with renewed spirits and entered the studio once again in late 2005 to record a six song EP titled "Ghosts".
Ghosts Era.
This was a solid time for Medusa Stone. They were touring consistently and building a solid fan base. The band had enjoyed two well received appearances at Wheeliefest: a Rowland, PA festival dedicated to grass roots music and true music lovers. They had the opportunity to open for Vince Neil and Blackfoot. They also made a side stage appearance at Alltel pavilion, opening for Three Doors Down, Shooter Jennings, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the midst of all this touring the band was still trying to secure a record deal. They had been in contact with many labels over the past few years going back as far as the Catfish Lane days. Sony Records recruited Jack Osbourne to check out the band in 2003 only to report that the style of music was not "marketable". Justin has often stated that Jack was right; this was before the name change and the band was playing primarily blues. Other connections were made with Arista Records, however things once again fell through. With almost two years of on and off touring the band decided to take a small break to write and record a full length album. They entered the studio in January 2007 to record "Shaking Hands".
Shaking Hands and Right Hook Records.
Medusa Stone recorded "Shaking Hands" over a period of four months at Audio Genesis in Wilmington, NC with long-time friend and fellow musician Tommy Brothers. Brothers recorded the band, helped with pre-production, and co-wrote "Loaded Gun" with Justin. He also plays rhythm guitar on the album and provides many backing vocals. Medusa Stone and Tommy Brothers share production credit for the album. Damon Johnson provided production consultation for the band from the road. During the mixing Tommy and Justin seemed to live in the studio, sometimes not leaving until 3am. Around the time of the album's completion the band was contacted by Right Hook Records, an independent label out of Greensboro, NC. The label showed interest in releasing the album and sent the final mixes to Atlanta, GA to have them mastered by Glenn Schick. The ending result would be what is now titled "Shaking Hands". The album was released on July 24, 2008. The band starts touring in support of it in August 2008.
Live Your Life and adding a new member.
On Medusa Stone’s latest record “Live Your Life” the music is real and from the heart, taking inspiration from tragedy, Love and rebirth. “Live Your Life” is a snap shot of run away train pulled back onto the rails, framed in rock and pop fundamentals. Adding the newest member Worth Weaver(guitar,vocals). This has brought Medusa to a new level both live and in the studio.Rock n Roll music is more than a genre, it is something that can bring people together, to free their minds and electrify their spirits. Musician and fan are both part of a family, they rely on one another to feel the positive effects of music. Medusa Stone lives for their family and because of their family.

Decorah Shale

The Decorah Shale is a fossiliferous shale that makes up the lower most formation in the Galena Group. The Decorah lies above the Platteville Limestone and below the Galena Limestone in the sedimentary sequence that formed from the shallow sea that covered central North America during Ordovician Time. The Decorah consists of three members (from bottom to top): Spects Ferry, Guttenberg, and Ion. [http://www.iowageology.org/gb70/stop-09.htm] The Spects Ferry member is organic-rich and suggests a large influx of terrigenous sediment during deposition. The Guttenberg is characterized by nodular calcareous beds and contains several K-bentonite deposits. The Ion Member, present in the southern Decorah in Iowa, is characterized by alternating beds of shale and limestone. 
Where it crops out in the Upper Midwest, especially in the Twin Cities, the Decorah is a popular place for amateur fossil collecting. It contains trilobites, brachiopods, horn corals, gastropods, crinoids, and large numbers of bryozoans. Cephalopods may also be found in the lower layers of the Decorah Shale.

<doc id="18498124" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18498124" title="The Peculiar Institution">
The Peculiar Institution

The Peculiar Institution is a book about slavery published in 1956 by academic Kenneth M. Stampp of the University of California, Berkeley and other universities.
"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South" describes and analyzes the many different facets of slavery in the south, from the seventeenth century through the mid-nineteenth century, including demographics, lives of slaves and slaveholders, the southern economy and labor systems, the northern and abolitionist response, slave trading, and political issues of the time. An interesting element of the book is how Stampp analyzes the standard view of historians such as Ulrich Phillips that many southern slave owners were very kind to their slaves, and provided well for them. It was sometimes known for slaves to have lives as good as or better than poor northern workers. However, Stampp examines this issue mostly to show this behavior as a selfish strategy, easing the lives of some slaves, in order to prevent dissent among slaves, or possible legal action for mistreatment of slaves. In fact this treatment did little to convince slaves that their lives were acceptable, and dissent and opposition were common among slaves.
Stampp's main thrust was to counter the arguments of prior historians who had characterized slavery generally as a benign, paternalistic tradition, helpful in many ways to the slaves, which encouraged racial harmony in the southern states. Stampp also characterizes some critics of slavery as adopting a position where they claimed that "to the Negroes, slavery seemed natural; knowing no other life, they accepted it without giving the matter much thought. Not that slavery was a good thing, mind you—but still, it probably hurt the Negroes less than the it did the whites. Indeed, the whites were really more enslaved than were the Negro slaves" (429). Stampp condemns such an argument and likens it to pro-slavery arguments before the Civil War, which were "based on some obscure and baffling logic" (429).
Stampp held that the national debate over the morality of slavery was the focal point of the Civil War. Stampp wrote, "Prior to the Civil War southern slavery was America's most profound and vexatious social problem. More than any other problem, slavery nagged at the public conscience; offering no easy solution..." (vii). The book was for Stampp not only history but a necessary examination for Americans in the 1950s because "it is an article of faith that knowledge of the past is a key to understanding the present," and "one must know what slavery meant to the Negro and how he reacted to it before one can comprehend his more recent tribulations" (vii). Later work by other historians qualified certain of Stampp's findings, but "The Peculiar Institution" remains a central text in the study of US slavery.
The organization of "The Peculiar Institution" includes the following chapters:
I. The Setting "Background and demographics in the Old South. "
II. From Day Clean to First Dark "Slaves' toilsome daily lives; slavery within southern labor systems."
III. A Troublesome Property "Defiance of slaves; Stampp asserts that African-American slaves actively resisted slavery, not just through uprisings and escape, but also through work slowdowns, feigning illness, damaging plantation machinery and work implements, theft, and other means. He lauds these actions as honorable resistance by slaves, which could be used as models by other oppressed groups, not least black Americans in the 1950s.."
IV. To Make Them Stand in Fear "Disciplinary practices and submission; slave feelings of inferiority; fear and dependence in slave life; religion; incentives offered to slaves; power structures; cruelty of slaveowners and overseers."
V. Chattels Personal "Conflicts in racial classifications; slave laws and codes; limited freedoms for slaves."
VI. Slavemongering "Slave movement and sales; African slave trade prior to the nineteenth century; separation of slave families."
VII. Maintenance, Morbidity and Mortality "Slave food, clothing, housing and sickness."
VIII. Between Two Cultures "Class and caste systems; personal relationships of slaves and masters; social positions; sex, family, religion, leisure."
IX. Profit and Loss "Slave value; economic gains and losses through slavery; slavery in the economic system; agrarian vs. industrial development in the Old South; land exhaustion in the Old South."
X. He Who Has Endured "Moral ambiguity of slaveowners; the desperate defense of slavery; destructive effects of slavery on free labor, non-slaveowners and white yeomen in the Old South; intellectual torpor in the South due to rigid pro-slavery positions."
Use by Martin Luther King.
In "", author Martin Luther King, Jr. quotes extensively from "The Peculiar Institution". King describes Stampp's "fascinating" depiction of "the psychological indoctrination that was necessary from the master's viewpoint to make a good slave."

His first professional series was the Barber Saab Pro Series in 1993 which he ran concurrently with the 1993 Barber FF Series, finishing 10th (1993) and 4th (1994) in series points in his two years with the league. The 1994 championship came down to four drivers (Boss, Diego Guzman, Mark Hotchkiss and Juan Pablo Montoya) at the season finale in Phoenix, with future NASCAR driver Jerry Nadeau winning the race and Columbia's Diego Guzman taking the 1994 series title. In 1994 Boss also teamed with his brother in the 12 Hours of Sebring driving Bob Leitzinger's factory backed Nissan 240SX but the car suffered from mechanical trouble while leading the GTU class. Although the car was repaired, it later retired due to engine failure. In 1995 Boss raced a select number of Barber Dodge pro Series, Vauxhaul Lotus (England) and USAC FF2000 races.
Indy Lights.
In 1996 he made his Indy Lights debut, driving in the first two races of the season but no other races. He competed in the Barber Dodge Pro Series in 1997, finishing 3rd in the championship with six podium finishes and a victory at Mid-Ohio. He returned to Indy Lights full-time in 1998 with Conquest Racing and had a best finish of 4th at Michigan International Speedway, a race which he momentarily led but finished under caution. In 1999 he moved to LucasPlace Racing but still only had a best finish of 4th, this time at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He drove for LucasPlace again in 2000, but the team was severely underfunded and closed their doors at the end of the season. Although he received and offer from Dale Coyne Racing, Boss never moved on to Champ Cars like his older brother. Along with his professional racing, Boss also competed for several years in the vintage racing series, HSR, driving a 1957 Porsche 356A Speedster.

Emergency Powers Act 1939

The Emergency Powers Act 1939 was an act of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) enacted on 3 September 1939 after an official state of emergency had been declared on 2 September 1939. The act allowed the government to:
The act gave the government the ability to maintain Irish neutrality during "The Emergency" by providing sweeping new powers to the government for the duration of the emergency, such as internment, censorship of the media and mail by postal censorship, and the government control of the economy.
During the Dáil debate on the act, Fine Gael TD, John A. Costello was highly critical of the delegation of powers, stating that,
Preparation for the emergency were well in hand a year before it was needed, because by way of the 1938 Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, access had been acquired to the British government's second world war legal emergency preparations. The Sudetenland crisis prompted the adapting of the British "war book" for Ireland's purposes with draft legislation already finished by September 18, 1938.
According to Tony Gray, the "Emergency Powers Orders", EPOs, "made under the Act were so draconian that they effectively abolished democracy for the period, and most aspects of the life of the country were controlled by the dictatorial powers the government acquired". The Garda Síochána got extended power of search and arrest. Compulsory cultivation of land and compulsory queuing for buses, were a few topics for which orders were made. A total of 7,864 orders were made. One aspect of the EPOs was that once they were laid before the Oireachtas, TDs could only annul an EPO, but could not scrutinise, or amend them like they could with legislation.
Media censorship of radio broadcasts was effected by having news bulletins read to the head of the Government Information Bureau for approval before being broadcast by Radio Éireann and weather forecasts were forbidden; this inconvenienced both farmers and fishermen.
The "Emergency Powers Act" finally lapsed on 2 September 1946. However the state of emergency itself was not rescinded until 1 September 1976.

Caro Dawes

Caro Dana Dawes, née Blymyer (January 6, 1866 – October 3, 1957), was the wife of Vice-President Charles Dawes, who served from 1925 to 1929. Therefore, she was the Second Lady of the United States during that period. 
Caro Blymyer married Charles Dawes in 1889. They had two children and adopted two more. After the death of their son Rufus in 1912, the Daweses retreated from social life and instead devoted much of their energies to charity work.
While serving as Second Lady, Dawes disappointed the social elite of Washington, DC because she declined many social invitations. Nonetheless, it was observed that her "manner was sweet and gentle, her conversation cultured, and her dignity unimpeachable."
Dawes died in 1957, and is buried along with her husband in Rosehill Cemetery.

Johnny Chester

John Howard "Johnny" Chester (born 26 December 1941) is an Australian singer-songwriter, who started his career in October 1959 singing rock'n'roll and in 1969 changed to country music. He has toured nationally with The Beatles, Roy Orbison, The Everly Brothers, Kenny Rogers, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette and Charley Pride. During his career he has led various groups including Johnny Chester and The Chessmen, Johnny Chester and Jigsaw, Johnny Chester and Hotspur. With Jigsaw he had five top 30 hit singles, "Gwen (Congratulations)" (1971), "Shame and Scandal", "Midnight Bus" (both 1972), "World's Greatest Mum" (No. 9, 1973) and "She's My Kind of Woman" (1974).
Chester has hosted various TV series: "Teen Time on Ten" (GLV-10, Gippsland, 1963–64), "Teen Scene" (ABC TV, 1964–65) and "Country Road" (ABC TV, 1977–78). He has worked as a radio announcer on Melbourne radio station 3UZ and Radio Australia. He wrote a musical comedy, "Rebound", that opened in Wagga Wagga. Chester has won Golden Guitars at the Country Music Awards of Australia for best selling track in 1975 and for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1981, 1982 and 1983. In 1994 he was awarded the Songmaker of the Year Award from the Tamworth Songwriters Association. According to Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, he is "one of Melbourne's first and best rock'n'roll singers of the early 1960s". Music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, acknowledges Chester's "essential inclusion on any major national rock package coming into Melbourne" and later he "helped bring Australian country music to pop respectability".
Biography.
John Howard Chester was born on 26 December 1941 and grew up in Melbourne's suburb of Preston. His father, Jack, was a mechanic with his garage in Carlton, and his mother was Norma. He has a younger sister, Margaret (born ca. 1951). Chester attended Bell Primary and followed with Preston Technical School. At the age of 14, he left school and worked as a brake specialist for his father. He had learned to play the drums, from the age of six, and guitar. In October 1959 Chester formed a band, The Jaywoods, and organised dances at a West Preston church hall, "I could play the guitar ... but I was pretty useless at it. So I started singing – and the kids seemed to like my voice ... We used to get about 200 kids to these dances ... We had an old amplifier that distorted everything, but we thought we were mighty". His idols were Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent and Johnny O'Keefe. Music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, noted "without really trying the Jaywoods' rehearsals were attracting a crowd to St. Cecilia's Hall in West Preston, which turned into regular Saturday night dance". By 1960 The Jaywoods became Johnny Chester and The Chessmen with Chester on lead vocals, Jeff Cason on upright slap bass guitar, Huey Fryer on lead guitar, Bert Stacpool on piano, Les Stacpool on saxophone, and Len Woodhouse on drums. The following year the line-up were Bert Stacpool, Les Stacpool (now on guitar), Frank McMahon on bass guitar and Graeme Trottman on drums.
Chester was also backed by The Thunderbirds, which were an instrumental group formed in 1957 and, by the end of 1960, consisted of Henri Bource on saxophone and flute, Harold Frith on drums, Charles Gauld on guitar, Gordon Onley on bass guitar and Murray Robertson on piano. Both backing bands maintained independent careers, released their own material and backed other artists. In April 1961 Chester's first stadium performance was supporting Connie Francis and Johnny Burnette. One of his early fans was radio DJ, Stan Rofe, who promoted the artist on the 3KZ program, "Platter Parade". Rofe was highly supportive and introduced Chester to W&G Record's Ron Tudor. Chester signed with the label and issued his debut single, "Hokey Pokey", in May 1961 with backing by The Thunderbirds. The track became a top 10 hit in Melbourne. His second single, "Can Can Ladies", appeared in July and reached the local top 5 in July. In January 1962 a third single backed by The Thunderbirds, "Shakin' All Over", reached No. 4. Johnny Chester and The Chessmen toured to Brisbane and Hobart but had less popularity in Sydney.
From 1962 to 1964 his next eight singles for W&G were all recorded with backing by The Chessmen. Of these, the highest charting was a cover version of Cochran's "Summertime Blues", which appeared at No. 6 in December 1962. He had also issued his debut album, "Wild and Warm" in 1963 and two extended plays, "Johnny Chester's Hit Parade" and "My Blues and I", with W&G. In February that year he took over as host of "Teen Time on Ten", on regional Gippsland channel GLV-10. "Australian Women's Weekly"s Ainslie Baker declared he had "proved himself an easy, friendly talker" and predicted this could lead to his "having Melbourne's first teenage TV show". In July 1964 Chester supported the Australian tour by The Beatles with his backing by The Phantoms. According to Chester "my only worry is that I mightn't live up to this honour and obligation to give the kids a good performance". He was disappointed that The Chessmen were unavailable for the 19-gigs, through state capitals and to New Zealand, "As all the boys have day jobs ... they would not be able to get the time off". The Phantoms were another instrumental group, which had formed in 1960, and by 1964 had the line-up of Alan Fenton on drums, Bob Garde on rhythm guitar, Dave Lincoln on lead guitar, and Pete Watson on bass guitar. From October for two seasons, Chester was the host of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC-TV) program, "Teen Scene", with The Chessmen as the resident band.
He recorded further material for W&G on their sub-label, In Records but none charted and by mid-1966 he parted with the W&G and The Chessmen. Retaining Bert Stacpool, he formed the Johnny Chester Four with Johnny Marco on guitar and Tom Vigushin on bass guitar. As well as maintaining his musical career, for eight years, Chester was a DJ on Melbourne's radio station, 3UZ. In May 1968 Chester formed a new backing band, Jigsaw, with Fenton, Ray Eames on lead guitar (ex-Tony Worsley and the Fabulous Blue Jays), Ron Gilby on rhythm guitar, Dennis Tucker on bass guitar (both Merv Benton and the Tamlas). Jigsaw also had an independent career. His last pop single, "Heaven Help the Man", appeared in 1968 on Astor Records. In 1969 his first two country music singles, "Green Green" and "Highway 31", were issued on Phillips Records. Johnny Chester and Jigsaw signed to Fable Records, owned by Tudor (ex-W&G Records). Fenton died in a car accident and was replaced on drums by Eddie Chapel, at about that time Eames was replaced by Jon Calderwood. In August 1970 Jigsaw, without Chester, had a number-one hit with a cover version of United Kingdom group, Christie's "Yellow River", it was co-credited with Sydney-based band Autumn which also covered the track. With Chester, they had five hit singles on the "Go-Set" National Top 40: "Gwen (Congratulations)" (No. 26, October 1971), "Shame and Scandal" (No. 13, February 1972), "Midnight Bus" (No. 25, December), "The World's Greatest Mum" (No. 9, August 1973) and "She's My Kind of Woman" (No. 19, June 1974).
Chester has won Golden Guitars at the Country Music Awards of Australia for best selling track in 1975 In 1977 Chester toured nationally, backed by the Blue Denim Country Band, and also compered "Country Road" for ABC-TV. In 1979 he formed Hotspur and continued to issue country music singles and albums into the 1980s. From 1981 to 1983, at three successive Tamworth Country Music Festivals, he won Male Vocalist of the Year. In 1994 he was awarded the Songmaker of the Year Award from the Tamworth Songwriters Association. According to Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, Chester is "one of Melbourne's first and best rock'n'roll singers of the early 1960s". Nimmervoll felt that in the early 1960s Chester was an "essential inclusion on any major national rock package coming into Melbourne" and during the 1970s he "helped bring Australian country music to pop respectability".
Personal life.
In October 1964 Johnny Chester married Larraine "Liz" Isbister (born ca. 1944), a stenographer. Liz had attended the same primary school and their grandparents were neighbours. The couple had begun dating in September 1959 – to the Royal Melbourne Show. As from October 2012 they have three daughters, eight grandchildren and live in Rosebud.

Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard

Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard (February 7, 1768 – November 27, 1825) was a French physician who was born in the village of Sompuis, département Marne. He was a younger brother to philosopher Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard (1763–1845).
He studied medicine in Paris, and in 1806 became chief physician at the Charenton mental asylum. In 1816 he became a professor of forensic medicine at the Faculté de Médecine de Paris, and in 1819 was appointed to the first chair of "médecine mentale".
In 1803 Royer-Collard founded the periodical, "Bibliothèque médicale". After his death in 1825, his position at the Charenton was filled by Jean-Etienne-Dominique Esquirol (1772–1840). 
One of his famous patients at the Charenton was Donatien Alphonse François de Sade (1740–1814), better known as Marquis de Sade, who spent the last eleven years of his life incarcerated at the asylum. Royer-Collard protested against the imprisonment of Marquis de Sade at the Charenton, believing him to be sane, and his only madness being vice. (This contrasts with the character Dr. Royer-Collard in the 2000 Philip Kaufman movie Quills, based on the Doug Wright play of the same name.)

University United Methodist Church

University United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas, is a United Methodist Church belonging to the Southwest Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church. Located at the corner of 24th Street and Guadalupe Street (known to locals as the "Drag"), UUMC has been a fixture near the University of Texas at Austin campus for more than 120 years.
History.
University United Methodist Church began its life in 1887 under the name Austin City Mission. The congregation met in a tiny building called Honey Chapel, which was located on the northeast corner of 24th Street and Whitis Avenue, one block east of the present location of the church. The first pastor was Rev. John E. Stovall, who served as pastor for one year.
In 1888, the church was renamed Twenty-Fourth Street Church, and the congregation continued to meet in the building known as Honey Chapel until 1891.
In 1891, a new brick building was built at the corner of 24th Street and Nueces, two blocks west of the church's present location. This new church continued to be called Twenty-Fourth Street Church until 1895, when it was renamed Hotchkiss Memorial Church. (Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Hotchkiss had been members of the church since the day of its first service in 1887.) The congregation remained Hotchkiss Memorial Church until 1905, when the name of the church was officially changed to University Methodist Church—even though services continued to be held in the Hotchkiss Memorial Church building until 1909.
In 1905, at the same time as the name change of the church, it was decided that the congregation would sell off the existing church building and property and invest the money in new property and a new building. The new property, on the Northeast corner of 24th Street and Guadalupe, was owned by an eccentric University of Texas math professor, who lived in a house build on stilts, and kept chickens under his house. The cornerstone for the new church was laid on October 8, 1907. Architect Frederick M. Mann designed the building, which was unlike any other in Austin at the time. The architectural style is considered to be Richardsonian Romanesque, similar to the style of buildings designed by noted architect Henry Hobson Richardson. The use of native limestone with a Mediterranean red-tile roof was unique in Austin at the time, although this style was soon adopted by The University of Texas as the central architectural style for most campus buildings built during the first half of the 20th century.
Work continued on the new church for nearly two years, with the congregation holding its first worship service in the new building on May 23, 1909.
A second building was added to the property in 1924. The Wesley Bible Chair building was constructed just north of the church, in the area now occupied by Heinsohn Hall. This new building housed all student activity at the church, as well as providing much-needed space for Sunday School classes and other meetings.
Also in 1924, the three-story rear section of the church was demolished and rebuilt, turning what had been Sunday School classrooms and offices into an expanded sanctuary and balcony space, leaving a few classroom spaces on either side. If you look at the exterior of the building, you can still see the third-floor windows underneath the eaves. While those windows once provided light to the classrooms on the third floor of the sanctuary, they are now only accessible from the attic above the barrel-vaulted section of the rear of the church.
The congregation purchased the property adjacent to the Wesley Bible Chair at some point before the 1940s, expanding the church's property to include the entire block between 24th and 25th Streets. An old bakery, along with several small buildings, were on that property, and those spaces were used for several years as meeting rooms for children's Sunday School, as well as Boy Scouts and other groups.
In 1949, the Wesley Bible Chair building was demolished, and a new education building was constructed. This four-story building, named Heinsohn Hall, still stands today, housing all offices for the church, along with a child care center, choir room, fellowship hall, chapel, library, kitchen and numerous Sunday School classrooms and meeting rooms.
A major renovation of the entire property was undertaken beginning in 1956, when the old bakery and other buildings on the corner of 25th Street were demolished to make room for a parking lot. During these renovations (known as "The Big Step" program), outdoor play areas attached to Heinsohn Hall's child care rooms were enclosed, and both Heinsohn Hall and the sanctuary building were air-conditioned. The exposed pipes in the sanctuary's pipe organ were covered with an organ screen, and the lantern or dome area in the ceiling of the sanctuary was closed off and turned into a fluorescent light fixture.
The name of the church changed again in 1968, when the Evangelical United Brethren Church joined with The Methodist Church to form The United Methodist Church. At that time, the official name of the church became University United Methodist Church.
The next major renovation to the church came in 1968-1969, when the original pipe organ was removed and a new Schantz pipe organ was installed. The new instrument was significantly larger than the original instrument, and the Schantz Organ Co. organ remains in place to this day.
The sanctuary was again renovated in 1978, when the chancel area and choir loft were expanded, and the dome was reopened to allow in natural light through the stained glass windows around its perimeter. Heinsohn Hall underwent a fairly large renovation in 1985 when an elevator tower was added to the building. Minor modifications were made to the sanctuary choir loft area in 1995, to accommodate a new Steinway grand piano.
In 2007, it was announced that a campaign would begin to raise money for a complete renovation of the now-100-year-old sanctuary building. This Capital Campaign was kicked off in early 2008, with the goal of raising $3 million for the first phase of the renovations. These renovations include a complete restoration/preservation of the stained glass windows, improving accessibility to the sanctuary for the mobility-impaired, replacing the 100-year-old roof, and a complete reconstruction of the chancel area, to enlarge it and bring it all to one level.
God Is Here.
In 1978, as part of the Festival of Worship, a new hymn was commissioned from renowned hymnwriter Fred Pratt Green. That hymn, "God Is Here," has since been published in many languages and in many different hymnals, including "The United Methodist Hymnal," "The Presbyterian Hymnal," "Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal," "A New Hymnal for Colleges and Schools," among many others.
Former Director of Music Russell Schulz-Widmar, commenting on "God Is Here," said, "Certainly in the area of church music at UUMC, commissioning that hymn is one of the most important things we've done."

The Attic Expeditions

The Attic Expeditions (also known as Horror in the Attic) is a 2001 horror film starring Andras Jones and Seth Green, with appearances by Alice Cooper and Ted Raimi.
Plot.
Trevor and Faith are a happy couple who decide to buy a home together. After purchasing their new house, Trevor is cleaning the attic and discovers a chest. In the chest there is a staircase, under which he finds a book of black magic that only he can read. He begins studying the book, and starts to perform rituals with Faith. In an effort to gain even greater power, he and Faith perform a ritual in an attempt to merge their two consciousnesses. The ritual goes wrong, and Faith suffers a violent death. Trevor calls the police.
Years later, Trevor appears in a hospital. Apparently having been found insane, he is now under the care of Dr. Ek. The doctor has learned about the book Trevor found, and wants to use it for his own means - one of which, he later admits, is to cure all mental illness. It is around this time that Dr. Coffee comes to stay at the sanitarium and study under Dr. Ek. Trevor seems to have forgotten much of his past including practicing black magic and killing Faith. Dr. Ek talks with Trevor, trying to help him regain any previous memories about where Trevor may have hidden the book. At first Ek is very coy about his intentions. He worries that if Trevor knows the value of the book and his intent, he won't willingly surrender it.
Dr. Ek sends Trevor to be rehabilitated at "The House of Love." While Trevor thinks he's being sent to a recovery facility filed with other patients, he is actually being sent to his former house which is now filled with actors pretending to be patients. He interacts with the other patients, and eventually befriends Douglas. While he thinks Douglas is just as oblivious to the strange happenings in the house, Douglas is actually trying to get Trevor to sneak around the house (including the attic) and expose the location of the book. Ronald pretends to confess secrets of the house, hoping it will motivate Trevor to explore more. As Douglas and Trevor's conversations and expeditions continue, Trevor develops an interest in Amy - another supposed patient. While Amy seduces and has sex with Trevor, the first "murder" takes place. As time goes on, several more fake murders are orchestrated in an attempt to build urgency and get Trevor to continue exploring.
Unhappy with his results so far, Dr. Ek commits further surgery on Trevor. As Dr. Coffee's skepticism builds, Dr. Ek also subjects Trevor to several medications and hallucinogens. In his drugged state, Trevor communicates with Faith who now appears to be searching for the book as well. She explains to Trevor his past, the truth about the House of Love, and Dr. Ek's actual intent. She has sex with Trevor and tries to manipulate him into giving her the book.
Dr. Ek has another conversation with Trevor, and sends him back to the House of Love. Previously murdered characters are seen alive, just as they were the first time Trevor came to the house. While Trevor remembers his previous time here, the actors continue to pretend he has never been here before. The charade breaks down and actors begin to confess the ruse. Trevor suspects Faith will attempt to possess one of them in a final attempt to find the book. Observing all of this on the monitors, Dr. Coffee and Dr. Ek have a fight over Dr. Ek's methods. Dr. Ek drugs Dr. Coffee in a fit of rage. Dr. Ek eventually accepts the experiment's failure. He sends two orderlies to the house and begins to pack up and leave the sanitarium.
Thinking Faith has possessed Amy, he kills her. As the orderlies arrive at the house, Douglas (who is the one actually possessed by Faith) kills them and goes looking for Trevor. They run through the house, and Trevor eventually knocks Douglas down and makes his way to the attic. Douglas follows him down the stairs within the chest, and Trevor kills him. Trevor begins to see the situation playing out the way it did when he killed Faith in her own physical body. He attempts to make his way out of the Attic while another version of his consciousness is knocking on the chest. In the final scene, Trevor is seen pulling himself into the chest.
Production.
"The Attic Expeditions" was originally written to be the fourth film in the "Witchcraft" series. After reading the script, Kasten decided it had far more potential than he saw in the "Witchcraft" films. Together with the producers, they spent several years alternating between fundraising and filming. 
The film is notable for being one of Seth Green's early performances in his transition from working as a child actor; Jeffrey Combs (who was attached from very early on) was responsible for bringing Seth and many of the other lead actors to the film. 
Toward the end of production, a modern rock soundtrack was added at the request of the producers (and against Kasten's wishes) in an attempt to sell a soundtrack. While a soundtrack was never actually released, Blockbuster eventually picked the film up for distribution.
Critical reception.
One of the only reviews from a prominent source is by "Variety", who gave the film a negative review, calling it "an overly ambitious slice of Grand Guignol that is none too grand in conception or execution", and writing, "it could do small biz on the midnight circuit, although auds would have to be told whether laughing or cringing would be most appropriate."

Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar

Padma Vibhushan Diwan Bahadur Sir Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, KCSI(b. October 14, 1887 - d. July 17, 1976) was an Indian lawyer, politician and statesman who served as a senior leader of the Justice Party and in various administrative and bureaucratic posts in pre-independence and independent India.
Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar was born on October 14, 1887 in the town of Kurnool and had his schooling in Kurnool. He graduated from the Madras Christian College and studied law at the Madras Law College. On completion of his studies, practised as a lawyer before joining the Justice Party and entering politics. Mudaliar was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council in 1920 and served from 1920 to 1926 and as a member of the Madras Legislative Assembly from 1931 to 1934, losing to S. Satyamurti in the 1934 elections. He served as a member of the Imperial Legislative Council from 1939 to 1941 and as a part of Winston Churchill's war cabinet from 1942 to 1945. He was India's delegate to the San Francisco Conference and served as the first President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. He also served as the last Diwan of Mysore kingdom and occupied the seat from 1946 to 1949.
Early life.
Ramasamy Mudaliar was born on October 14, 1887 in Kurnool in a Tamil-speaking Thuluva Vellalar family. He was the eldest of a pair of twins, the other being Arcot Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar. He studied at Municipal High school, Kurnool and graduated in arts from Madras Christian College. On graduation, Mudaliar studied law and was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council. Uncle to world war II vateran Commander V.S.P.Mudaliar. File photo of Ramasamy mudaliar along with Krishnamachari two representative in imperial war cabinet.
Justice Party.
Ramasamy Mudaliar was a part of the Justice Party ever since its inception in 1917 and served as its General Secretary. In July 1918, Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar went to England along with Dr. T. M. Nair and Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu as a part of the Justice Party delegation to argue in favor of communal representation and give evidence before the Reforms Committee. The evidence was taken just before Dr. Nair's death on July 17, 1919.
Ramasamy Mudaliar rose in stature gradually and began to be regarded as the "brain of the Justice Party". He assisted in coordinating between non-Brahmins in different parts of India and organizing non-Brahmin conferences. Mudaliar was a prominent orator and was known for his inspiring speeches.
In the elections to the Madras Legislative Council held on November 8, 1926, the Justice Party lost the elections winning just 21 of the 98 seats in the Council. Mudaliar was one of the many who met with failure in the elections. Mudaliar took a temporary retirement from politics and replaced P. N. Raman Pillai as the editor of "Justice", the mouthpiece of the Justice Party. Under Mudaliar, there was a tremendous growth in circulation and the "Justice" became widely popular. On March 1, 1929, Mudaliar appeared before the Simon Commission along with Sir A. T. Paneerselvam another important leader of the Justice Party, to provide evidence on behalf of the Justice Party. Mudaliar served as the mayor of Madras from 1928 to 1930. In 1935, Mudaliar resigned as the Chief Editor of "Justice" following his appointment to the Tariff Board. Mudaliar was knighted in the 1937 Coronation Honours List, by which time he was a member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. He received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 25 February 1937.
All India Non-Brahmin Movement.
Mudaliar maintained friendly relations with Shahu Maharaj and non-Brahmin leaders from Maharashtra and parts of North India and helped in coordinating between and uniting leaders from different parts of India and in organizing non-Brahmin conferences. Mudaliar was a participant in the Satara non-Brahmin Conference held on December 18, 1922. Rajaram II presided over this conference. He also participated in the All-India Non-Brahmin Conference held at Belgaum on December 26, 1924 where Mudaliar's oratory was appreciated. At the Seventh Non-Brahmin Conference held on February 8, 1925, he appealed for unity amongst non-Brahmins.
Following the death of Sir P. T. Theagaroya Chetty in 1925, Ramasamy Mudaliar functioned as the sole link between Shahu Maharaj's Satya Shodhak Samaj and the Justice Party. He assisted the Raja of Panagal in organizing an All-India Non-Brahmin Confederation at Victoria Hall, Madras on December 19, 1925. Mudaliar supported the candidature of B. V. Jadhav who was eventually appointed President. On December 26, 1925, he organized a second conference at Amaravati. The conference comprised two sessions. The Maharaja of Kolhapur presided over the first while the Raja of Panagal presided over the second. In the second session of the Conference, Mudaliar said:
Mudaliar's utterances at this conference became the target of "The Hindu" which criticized him by saying that "the Speaker was desiring to produce an effect in another province, forced him to draw rather freely on his imagination".
As member of the War Cabinet.
Shortly before the Second World War broke out in 1939, Ramaswamy Mudaliar was appointed member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. In June 1942, he was knighted again as a KCSI. In July 1942, Ramasamy Mudaliar was appointed to Prime Minister Winston Churchill's War Cabinet, one of the two Indians nominated to the post,with equal rights and privileges as representatives from Britain's dominions. I
As President of ECOSOC.
Mudaliar served as India's delegate to the United Nations at the San Francisco Conference between April 25 and June 26, 1945 where he chaired the committee which discussed economic and social problems. Mudaliar was elected as the First President of the Economic and Social Council during its session at Church House, London, on January 23, 1946. Under his presidency, the Economic and Social Council passed a resolution in February 1946 calling for an international health conference. At the health conference which was eventually held on June 19, 1946, inaugurated by Sir Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, the World Health Organization came into being and the constitution for the new organization was read out and approved by delegates from 61 nations. On the expiry of his one-year term, he returned to India and took over as the Chief Minister of Mysore.
As Diwan of Mysore.
Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar was appointed as the Dewan in 1946. He succeeded Dewan N. Madhava Rao. He presided over a very turbulent period. On 3 June 1947, Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy made a public declaration about the acceptance by the Indian Leaders for partition of India in to two Independent dominion. This announcement had a tremendous impact on the Indian States. Early in June 1947. the Dewan convened a Press Conference , at Bangalore, and announced that the Mysore Government had taken a decision to accede to the New dominion of India and to send its representatives to the Indian Constituent assembly. Thereafter British parliament passed the Indian Independence Act, 1947 on 15 july 1947 and the Bill received Royal Assent on 18 july 1947. This act provided for the creation of independent dominion of India and Pakistan on 15 Aug 1947. This act also freed the Indian states from the suzerainty of British Government. There were a lot of misgivings about the lapse of suzerainty and the resultant freedom given to the over 560 Indian States. Indian leaders drafted an Instrument of Accession asking the Rulers to accede to the dominion government on three subjects of Defence, Communication and External affairs. Maharaja of Mysore executed the Instrument of accession on 9 Aug 1947 and the same was accepted by the Governor General of India on 16 Aug 1947. But this also gave impetus to the local congress leaders to renew their demand for a Responsible Government. This led to an agitation known as " Mysore Chalo". There appears to be a obfuscation of facts among the agitating public that Mysore Maharaja on the advice of the Dewan and his secretary Sir. T.Thamboo Chetty was refusing to join the Indian Union. The truth of the matter was India was not a Union then. India had just become an Independent Dominion. Maharaja of Mysore was one of the earliest to sign the Instrument of accession. Maharaja soon on 24 Sept 1947 gave his assent to setting up of a Responsible Government and on 25 Oct 1947, Mr. K.C. Reddy became the First Chief Minister with a cabinet of nine ministers. But Dewan continued to remain asa link between the Cabinet and the Maharaja. But as Maharaja accepted the recommendation of the Constituent assembly of Mysore to accept the Constitution of India for the state of Mysore and become a Part-B state in the soon to be formed Republic of India, and issued a proclamation to this effect on 25 Nov 1949. With this the post of Dewan was also abolished. During his tenure as Diwan of Mysore, Mudaliar organised a number of Tamil music concerts in the Mysore kingdom in order to raise money for the restoration of Carnatic musician Tyagaraja's samadhi or tomb at Tiruvaiyaru.
Mr. Ramasamy Mudaliar was sent by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as head of the Indian Delegation To New York to argue India's case in The Security Council when Hyderabad appealed to it against Accession to India and eloquently argued the case for India and Security council decided in favour of India.
Later years.
Mudaliar was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1970. In his later years, Mudaliar served as the Chairman of the India Steamship Company and of the Tube Investments of India, until his death in 1976; helped AMM group setup TI cycle of India. AMM group runs Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar higher secondary school in Ambattur in remembrance of him.A.R.L.M. Matriculation Higher Secondary School is run by his family in his remembrance. His sons are based out of United States.
Religious beliefs.
Despite his violent tirades against "Varnashrama dharma" and Hindu scriptures in his writings and editorials in the "Justice", Ramasamy Mudaliar was known to be a staunch Vaishnavite. He regularly sported the Vaishnavite "namam". Once while offered beef during a visit to England, he refused it with horror.
Notes.
Dr.Lakshmanasamy Mudaliar is the younger twin brother of Sir A.Ramasamy Mudaliar.

Statehood Party officials tried to get her to retire, which she resisted, but eventually they succeeded, only to realize that they had nobody to replace her, at which point they worked to persuade her not to retire. By then, however, the electorate was tired of the issue and she finished third in an at-large race that elected two council members.

Zhang Haijie

Zhang Haijie (; born 28 August 1971) is a Singaporean television news presenter with MediaCorp TV Channel 8, one of two Mandarin Chinese free-to-air television channels in Singapore. Born in Xi'an, China, she became a Singaporean citizen in 2003. Since 1 May 2008, she has been anchoring "News Tonight" (previously known as "News 8 at Ten") every weekday night. Zhang has a reputation for being a highly respected news anchor in the industry, and proves to be popular among the audience due to her distinctive clear voice and professional image she portrays in the newsroom.
Zhang was a part-time Ph.D. candidate at the Nanyang Technological University's Chinese division, researching the changing political role of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry before Singapore's independence. She completed her PhD in April 2012. 
Career.
Prior to relocating to Singapore in November 1998, Zhang graduated top of her cohort from the Communications University of China (formerly known as Beijing Broadcasting Institute) with a First Class Honours Degree in Broadcasting and Hosting （播音主持专业）. After graduation, Zhang taught at her alma mater for four years before moving on to journalism.
Zhang then worked in the Shanghai Cable TV Station for one-and-a-half years as a financial-news presenter and producer. She then decided to relocate to Singapore to work abroad. One week into her initial job as a trainer, where she worked at the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) (now MediaCorp's News Department), she was asked to anchor the 1 pm news bulletin instead. Zhang was then promoted and asked to anchor the 10 pm news on MediaCorp TV Channel 8.
In 2003, with SPH MediaWorks Channel U, Zhang hosted the current-affairs programme, "Inside Out", which explores various social issues in Singapore and the region. The programme was very well received, which set the record with sky-high viewership ratings. "(Inside Out, last episode)" Till now, no other Chinese-language current-affairs programme has managed to break the viewership record "Inside Out" had set. Zhang also co-hosted radio talkshows on UFM 1003.
On 1 January 2005, following the merger with MediaCorp TV and SPH MediaWorks, SPH MediaWorks closed down. Zhang was the only news anchor from SPH MediaWorks to be invited back to MediaCorp's News department. However, she rejected the move.
Zhang took a six-month break, travelled to places such as Egypt and Russia. In July 2005, she went back to studies and became a full-time PhD candidate at Nanyang Technological University's Chinese division with her thesis on the political role of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry before Singapore's independence.
After three years off the air, Zhang announced on 7 January 2008, that she would return to broadcasting on MediaCorp TV Channel 8, and would assume duties as a news anchor on 15 February 2008, reporting on the "2008 Singapore Government Financial Budget".
Controversies.
"Cross-over to SPH MediaWorks".
In 2001, she resigned from MediaCorp News and crossed-over to rival TV station SPH MediaWorks Channel U. It was rumoured that she left MediaCorp because she was unhappy she did not win the Best News Presenter Prize in the Star Awards 2001 despite leading by a landslide victory of 70% of the audience vote according to several reports by the local media. "(Straits Times, 2008)" She resigned four days after the award ceremony was held. Then SPH MediaWorks head Man Shu Sum (now Director of MediaCorp Raintree Pictures) dismissed the rumours and added that negotiations with Zhang were going on for months before the award ceremony.
When interviewed in Year 2003 by Lianhe Zaobao, Zhang admitted that she was extremely disappointed she did not bag the coveted award in 2001. Zhang also revealed she cried in the taxi while on her way home because the taxi driver had thought she won the award. She disclosed that she was not on good terms with her colleagues in MediaCorp TV and hinted that one's work performance there was judged solely based on the amount of work hours put in. (Ref: 15 Dec 2004, Lianhe Zaobao)
"Missing out on Best News Presenter Award".
Zhang has been nominated for the "Best News Presenter" every year while under MediaCorp TV's employment, but never won the award. In January 2011, an online Facebook page was set up in a bid to garner audience support for Zhang to win her long overdue "Best News Presenter" prize. Many netizens have also expressed support for Zhang in various online forums, as well as on MediaCorp TV Channel 8's Chinese language News Official Facebook Page.
However, Zhang did not win the award once again in 2011. Her poor public relations skill was thought to be a contributing factor as to why she has never won despite being widely acknowledged as one of the finer news presenters in the industry with vast experience. Zhang was once quoted as saying to reporters: "I once told my superior this – The TV station employed me all the way from China to come here to work, not to make friends."
Nevertheless when Zhang was interviewed in 2009, she was quoted as telling reporters that she no longer held any expectation of winning an award. Zhang said her perception of life changed greatly after a close friend of hers had a brain tumour in 2007, which made her treasure life more and do what she loves most - newsreading. She added that the audience support garnered for her would be the best form of recognition.
Zhang finally bagged the award in 2012 for her broadcasts and live analysis with political analysts for the Singaporean general election, 2011 and Singaporean presidential election, 2011.
Family life.
Zhang is the youngest child of a school-principal father and an architect mother. She has two older sisters and an older brother.
She is unmarried and has said she does not mind going for match-making sessions to find a partner. Zhang was rumoured to be dating Creative Technology CEO Sim Wong Hoo, but she denied the rumours.

Zhong Xang Yajiaumo

Zhong Xang Yajiaumo, also known as Tou Long Vaj or Yan Ju Muo, born on June 26, 1154, was the General of the Huang / Miao (also known as Hmong) people's rebellion during the 11th through the mid-12th centuries in Southern China against the Song Dynasty. He was born in the mountains in a Miao village and grew up hated by many of the villagers because he was poor and was an orphan. Instead of learning his culture's teachings, he studied swordsmanship and martial arts, and then defended his village from random attacks of the Chinese, (Xhua Liab).
When the Emperor ordered a sweep to take out the Miao people, many fled into deeper southern Asia; Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. Those who stayed supported Zhong Xang with the war against the Chinese; in the first battle in the northern mountains of Huangshan, Zhong Xang led his people to victory. Stunned by this, the Emperor ordered more men to attack, but the second battle of Qin Xing was won by Zhong Xang as well.
At Haji Bay, Zhong Xang and his armies were ambushed and Yajiaumo almost died. He managed to survive with the help of the "Green Hmong" (Hmoob Gauws), who later agreed to help him fight.
In 1172, the Khong Ming of the Song surrendered and fled to the east. The Miao people then moved to the higher mountains to avoid future warfare.
In 1186, arrows lit with fire and yelling from the distance was heard as Chinese soldiers ravaged the mountains of Huangshan. Once again, the Miao was forced to fight.
Zhong Xang was appointed general and battle continued until 1208, when Zhong Xang's soldiers numbered less than 150,000. Before the battle, he gave a speech to the Miao People and asked them to help him in the battle; instead, 66% of the population of the Southern China region decided to leave, leaving him with less than 12,000 soldiers. Not surrendering, he plunged into an attack on the Chinese.
He was outnumbered and his entire army was wiped out in less than 4 hours. Zhong Xang was caught and faced the Emperor.
He refused to willingly kneel before the Emperor, so his back-knees were cut by a knife, forcing him to kneel. Grabbing his sword, he plunged the grounds and forced himself to never bow down. The Emperor then grabbed his knife and plunged it into Zhong Xang's neck, causing him to bleed and die, in the winter of 1209. Almost a thousand years later, his remains were found and a statue was built in his memory.

Love Games (Belle and the Devotions song)

"Love Games", written and composed by Paul Curtis and Graham Sacher, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1984, performed by the trio Belle and the Devotions, which was headed by Kit Rolfe. 
Belle and the Devotions won the right to perform at Luxembourg by winning the UK national final, "A Song for Europe", where they were the fourth act to perform. At Luxembourg, the song was performed sixth on the night, following Norway's Dollie de Luxe with "Lenge leve livet" and preceding Cyprus' Andy Paul with "Anna Maria Lena". At the end of judging that evening, "Love Games" took the seventh-place slot with 63 points. At the time, the song was the third-worst performer for the United Kingdom since entering Eurovision in 1957 (the songs in 1966 and 1978 were the only ones to rank lower).
The song was an homage to the girl group sound of 1960s Motown, with the girls lamenting that their lovers had "played love games" with them and broken their hearts. The trio was dressed in bright day-glo coloured jackets and miniskirts, with similarly eye-popping hair (Rolfe went for a platinum blonde, while the other singers dyed their hair yellow and bright red, respectively). 
At the end of their performance, some cheers in the audience were met with boos, as many people in Luxembourg were still upset with the United Kingdom after English football fans rioted in the country as a result of being knocked out of the European Championship the previous November.
After Eurovision, the song peaked at #11 on the UK Singles Chart.

<doc id="18498549" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18498549" title="Arnau March">
Arnau March

Arnau March (fl. c. 1410–30) was a Provenço-Catalan knight and poet of the famous March family. He was related—it is unknown how—to Jaume I, Jaume II, Pere, and Ausiàs March. He bore the rank of "mossèn" ("milord"). He was active during the life and consortship of Margarida de Prades (queen 1409, nun 1424, dead 1430), to whom he addressed one poem, and before the compilation of the Cançoner Vega-Aguiló (1420–30), which contains three of his poems. In total, he has left only six pieces of verse. His dates suggest that he came a generation or two after the brothers Jaume II and Pere and one before Ausiàs. He may have been a nephew of the former and cousin of the latter, but it cannot be proved. 
Arnau's work can be divided into three types: his three religious and three amorous pieces, and a single fragment preserved in part by Pere Torroella. His religious masterpiece is the "Visió de la Verge Maria" ("Vision of the Virgin Mary") which, in a solemn and pious tone, heaps praise on the Virgin Mary, the angels, Apostles, martyrs, and virgins. Its final "tornada" makes reference to "mercès a vós demana" ("thanks to your pleading"), which may be an allusion to the local cult of Barcelona for Mary Mother of Mercy. 
Arnau's "Qui parà dir lo misteri ten alt" is a gloss on the Annunciation as described in the Gospel of Luke, 1:31–38. The wording of this narrative poem is both scholastic and emotional. The Latin Vulgate translation of Luke is provided as a refrain after each verse: "Ecce ancilla Domini; fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum!" ("Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" in the KJV). Arnau's final religious poem, "Un novell fruyt, exit de la rabaça", is a gloss on the Nativity as described in the first chapter of the Gospel of John. In it the scholasticism completely overtakes the traditional lyrical treatment of its subject. 
Just as his religious poems fall completely within the scholastic tradition, so Arnau March's love poems fall completely within the courtly love tradition of the troubadours. His poetic style is similar in his religious and courtly verses: elegant, delicate, and emotive. "Si m'havets tolt, Amor, del tot lo sen", is a "planh" (lament) of the duress of a lady in love. In "Novelh penser m'és vengutz soptamén" Arnau questions whether a woman would actually believe the calumny raised against the service of love. Arnau's most famous love song is the "Cançó d'amor tençonada", which is phrased as a debate ("tenso") between Wisdom and the Heart. The tension between the demands of these two domains was a constant theme in contemporary lyric poetry. The debate, in March, is unresolved, but according to its rubric it was submitted for adjudication to "senyora reyna dona Margarida" (Queen Margarida), but no further verses were added.

Her next victim was on 20 April, southwest of Rockall; also lost when this ship went down were two launches which were being carried as deck cargo: "ML-1003" and "M-1037".
3rd, 4th and 5th and patrols.
These sorties were conducted in mid-Atlantic but were uneventful.
6th patrol.
"U-73" entered the Mediterranean Sea via the heavily defended Straits of Gibraltar on 14 January 1942 during her sixth patrol. Rosenbaum claimed to have sunk a destroyer in February, but post-war records offer no confirmation. She docked at La Spezia in Italy on 12 February.
7th patrol.
The submarine was attacked by a Bristol Blenheim of No. 203 Squadron RAF about north northwest of Derna in Libya on 22 March 1942. The damage was such that the boat was unable to dive and had to return to La Spezia on 26 March 1942. The U-boat was under repair at La Spezia for four months.
8th patrol.
On 11 August 1942 she sank the aircraft carrier during Operation Pedestal (supplying Malta). Rosenbaum was awarded the Knight's Cross and sent to command the Black Sea U-boat flotilla.
9th patrol.
First watch officer Horst Deckert was promoted to command "U-73". He was the son of German-American parents living in Chicago and had joined "U-73"s crew as a midshipman in 1940. "U-73" was depth-charged during an unsuccessful attack on Operation Torch (the invasion of French North Africa) troopships on 7 November. On 10 November, "U-73" missed the battleship with four torpedoes launched at a range of five kilometers.
She also damaged the "Lalande" off Oran on 14 November 1942. This ship was under repair until June 1943.

The boat was also attacked by a British Lockheed Hudson of 500 Squadron on 27 December 1942; damage was slight - the Hudson was shot down. She sank the 7,200-ton American Liberty ship SS "Arthur Middleton" from the convoy UGS 3 on 1 January 1943 miles off Oran.
12th patrol.
As allied forces prepared for Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily), "U-73" sank the 1,600-ton British freighter "Brinkburn" off Oran on 21 June 1943 and damaged the 8,300-ton Royal Navy oiler RFA "Abbeydale" on 28 June 1943.

As the damaged vessel returned to port, the destroyers , and left Mers-el-Kebir to find the U-boat. She was located by sonar at 18:15. Hull turbulence made the U-boat's hydrophones ineffective at the speed "U-73" was leaving the area, so she was unaware of the destroyers until "Woolsey"s pattern of depth charges exploded below the submarine at 18:39. Sea water poured in between the bow torpedo tubes and from a salt water inlet valve for the diesel engine cooling system. All ballast tanks were blown to bring "U-73" to the surface as inflowing water exceeded pumping capacity. "U-73" surfaced in darkness at 19:27 and men manned the heavy machine guns. The destroyers promptly detected her on radar and illuminated the submarine with searchlights. She sank by the stern following a brief exchange of gunfire, 34 of the crew were rescued by 22:10. Three of "Woolsey"s crew were wounded by machine gun fire and sixteen of the U-boat crew perished.

Danielle Jones (EastEnders)

Danielle Jones is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Lauren Crace. The character appeared between 18 August 2008 and 3 April 2009. Crace's casting in the role was announced in July 2008, when she was described as a love interest for fellow new character Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan). In October 2008, it was revealed that Danielle was actually the long-lost daughter of established character Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). Crace has disclosed that even she was unaware of this fact upon being cast in the role, but always knew Danielle would only have a short arc. Danielle's feelings were further explored in a segment of the BBC "EastEnders" homepage entitled Danielle's Diary, documenting the character's thoughts on the storylines she was involved in, while a special episode of "EastEnders Revealed" entitled "The Secret Mitchell" further explored the character's impact on the show.
Danielle's storylines focused on her friendship with local resident Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), her crush on Callum, and her adoption secret. She was deemed a welcome addition to the soap by members of the Telford local council, for raising awareness of the town the character originates from, however was poorly received by "The Guardian" Gareth McLean and Grace Dent, and dubbed "Drippy Danielle" by the "Daily Mirror" Jane Simon. Her final episode was watched by 11.46 million viewers, and caused a notable power surge on the National Grid.
Storylines.
Danielle arrives in Walford, having left her hometown of Telford and is befriended by local resident Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who gives her a job on her market clothing stall and offers her the spare room in her family's home. Danielle quickly develops a crush on fellow stall-trader Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan), who leads her on in an attempt to make Stacey jealous but he helps her get a second job, cleaning at The Queen Victoria public house, where she gets caught in the feud between Ronnie (Samantha Janus) and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). Both try to use Danielle to get information from the other, with Archie persuading Danielle to steal Ronnie's post. Ronnie is furious when she realises and sacks Danielle after publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen clutching a locket containing a photograph of Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's long-lost daughter, Amy.
It transpires that Danielle is the result of a teenage romance between Ronnie and her first boyfriend, Joel Reynolds. Archie disapproved of the pregnancy and put Danielle - named Amy by Ronnie — up for adoption. Danielle was adopted by Lizzie and Andy Jones (Aneirin Hughes). She began trying to locate her birth mother after Lizzie's death in 2007. Following Ronnie's tirade, Danielle tries to leave Albert Square but Stacey and her family persuade her to stay with them. 
Ronnie's sister, Roxy (Rita Simons, gives birth to a baby girl that she names Amy, to Danielle's surprise. Ronnie's dislike of her lessens with time, and when Danielle falls out with Stacey and ends up squatting in a flat owned by landlord Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Ronnie convinces him not to call the police.
Danielle later breaks down and tells Ronnie that she is pregnant by Paul, a barman she had a one night stand with. She intended to tell him about her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend. Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy, suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie. She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life. Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy. She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, so in order to preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression and she should keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts her off to maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses to believe her. Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Ronnie cradles Danielle and apologises for not believing her, saying that if she had known, she would never have given her up. Danielle dies in Ronnie's arms, leaving her devastated. Danielle is buried and a grief-stricken Ronnie sings to her when alone.
Creation and characterisation.
On 19 July 2008, "The Sun" reported that a new character, Danielle, would be introduced to "EastEnders" as the love interest of fellow newcomer Callum Monks. Nineteen-year-old Danielle was described as a "naive blonde [...] easily taken in by Callum's smooth patter", arriving in Walford with "just a suitcase and a dream of a new life". It was later revealed that Danielle had additionally been created as the long-lost daughter of established character Ronnie Mitchell, and a member of the soap's long-running Mitchell family. Her introduction had been planned from 2007, when story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins conceived the idea of two new Mitchell sisters, Ronnie and Roxy. Ronnie was depicted as the more detached and icy sister, and a hidden secret was first alluded to eight months after their introduction, when Roxy made a veiled reference to Ronnie's child and a physical fight ensued. Several months later, off-set episodes shot in Weymouth and dubbed "Mitchell Week" by the BBC were aired, during which the audience were introduced to Ronnie and Roxy's father Archie, and learned that Ronnie had given a child up for adoption.
Treadwell-Collins explained that it was necessary to introduce Danielle shortly after this revelation, but in such a manner that she would arrive "under the audience's radar", to preserve the later revelation of her identity as Ronnie's daughter. Lauren Crace, then a third year student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, was cast as Danielle and began filming in June 2008. "EastEnders" was Crace's first professional acting role, and executive producer Diederick Santer expressed his pleasure that Crace had chosen to make her debut on the show. Upon her introduction, "EastEnders" producers attempted to deceive the audience into believing Danielle was nothing more than a new friend for Stacey. Crace herself was only told of Danielle's true identity after her successful audition, though as she only signed a six-month contract with the show, was always aware Danielle would only have a short arc. She stated that some audience members guessed Danielle to be Ronnie's daughter almost as soon as she arrived, and that she found maintaining the secret difficult.
Crace initially portrayed Danielle as being shy and afraid of rejection, though felt that Stacey's friendship and living with the Slater family could have a positive impact on her confidence. Discussing her failure at romantic relationships, Crace assessed that Danielle's eagerness may scare men off. She came to find portraying Danielle depressing, explaining that she was bored by and had doubts about Danielle's constant naivety and passive personality. She suggested to the producers that Danielle should stand up for herself more, which was accepted and adapted into her personality, to the point that by the end of her tenure on the show, Danielle was "not a little mouse any more". Crace's view is that Danielle's Mitchell heritage manifested itself in an inner-strength and ability to "come back fighting", giving her a toughness beneath her "wet and pathetic" personality.
Development.
Series writer Simon Ashdown explained that Danielle initially chose to conceal her identity from Ronnie due to her fear of being rejected. He described her as "hurt and broken by her life", and hoping to charm Ronnie into liking her before revealing the truth. Crace observed that Danielle was intrigued by Ronnie and the Mitchells, but also worried that she was too different from them and may be a disappointment to Ronnie. Danielle's pregnancy was used as a plot-device to bring the two closer together. Crace deemed the development "a huge thing" for Danielle, as contrary to her constant rejection, the one person she most desired support from was finally showing her affection. However, Ronnie's failure to attend Danielle's second clinic appointment signified "a step back" for the character, leaving her "hurt and distraught" and less willing to confide the truth in Ronnie than ever. 
In the aftermath of her abortion, Danielle was depicted as being increasingly emotionally unstable and angry with Ronnie, believing that she deserved to belong to the Mitchell family. The writers had Archie discover her secret as a test of his character, experimenting with whether he would be despicable enough to conceal the truth. Lamb deemed Danielle "a huge threat" to Archie's position as patriarch of the Mitchell family, explaining why he chose to lie that Ronnie was suffering from depression and Danielle ought not tell her. Danielle accepted the lie, believing it to explain Ronnie's "hot and cold" reaction to her, and attempted to care for Ronnie and help her recover. Crace explained that despite their turbulent relationship, Ronnie was all Danielle had ever wanted. Despite seeing Archie as "a domineering figure", Danielle initially trusted him and believed he would reunite her with her mother when the time was right. However, as time passed she became aware of Archie's "true colours" and grew afraid of him. 
The ultimate revelation of Danielle's identity was set at Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding "the perfect opportunity" for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, it gives you an event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment "as dramatic and sensational" as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter in front of the entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was "heartbreaking" and served to highlight the fact that "she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".
Danielle was killed off minutes after revealing her true identity to Ronnie, dying in her mother's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as "EastEnders" "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie to have her daughter, the "one thing that is key to her character" would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter, but as it was set in early April, snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence. A body double was used for the moment Danielle was run over. Although sad to leave, Crace felt that the story's conclusion was the right one, and was glad that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end, explaining: "It was so important that that tender moment was finally found, because that's all people wanted. It's all Danielle wanted, and it's all Ronnie wants." Crace concluded: "I think Danielle will leave quite a big mark on the Square and on the people in the Square – probably a bigger mark than she did when she was alive.
News of Danielle's death was subject to a media embargo, although several newspapers and magazines including the "Radio Times" leaked news of Crace's exit in advance of the event. Digital Spy's Kris Green reported that most of the online "EastEnders" community had anticipated the character's exit from the soap beforehand, some as early as January 2009.
Related media.
The BBC used viral promotion on the "EastEnders" homepage to further develop the character of Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." In this manner, viewers were able to keep up with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R&R... away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other "EastEnders" characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.
Reception.
Miles Hosken, a former mayor of Telford, welcomed the choice to give Danielle a Telford background due to the national exposure it gave the area. Sarah Raper, chief executive of economic development company Transforming Telford, commented: "We hope the new character will portray Telford in a positive light and increase national awareness of the town", and Councillor Eric Carter, Telford & Wrekin Council cabinet member for regeneration, adding: "There are a lot of people working to put Telford on the map and this will help". 
The "Daily Mirror" sympathised with Danielle over the storyline which saw her manipulated by Archie, deeming it one of the more interesting "EastEnders" plot strands. Gareth McLean of "The Guardian" described Danielle as a "wet weekend incarnate", criticising the drawn out nature of the secret Mitchell storyline. Fellow "Guardian" critic Grace Dent was similarly critical of the storyline, particularly the scripting. The "Daily Mirror" Tony Stewart wrote that "when a downcast Danielle walks into a room, it's like all the lights have been switched off", and his colleague Jane Simon christened the character "Drippy Danielle", writing that "If she's half Mitchell, her father must have been a marshmallow."
Discussing the character's death, Digital Spy's Kris Green praised Crace's acting. He compared Danielle's revelation that Ronnie was her mother to the "EastEnders" storyline several years previously, when Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) revealed she was actually the mother of her supposed sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan). Green opined: "Although it didn't quite capture the magic of Kat-Zoe scene it definitely comes an "extremely" close second." He concluded: "I'd probably go as far as to say that it's one of the best episodes "EastEnders" has produced in a long time". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by "The Guardian" Sarah Dempster. Simon called it "the "EastEnders" episode of the year", though was again critical of Danielle, writing: "As a nation we've been driven mad by Danielle screwing up her forehead, shrugging her shoulders and walking around like a wide eyed simpleton. She isn't the first person in the world to track down their biological mother and while it's seldom easy, I can't imagine it's ever been quite so hard as Danielle has made it." Writing for "The Times", Tim Teeman was critical of the length of time it took for the storyline to conclude, calling it "the most drawn-out 'reveal' in soapland". He deemed Ashdown's scripting of Danielle's exit to be "mad crescendo after mad crescendo", and the storyline as a whole "implausible", concluding that by the time Danielle died in Ronnie's arms: ""EastEnders" had hit the misery mother lode."
Crace was pleased with public reaction to the mother-daughter storyline, commenting prior to the reveal: "Everyone seems desperate to know why Danielle hasn't told Ronnie yet, so I'm taking that as a sign they're enjoying the story. Viewers are always telling me that they love it when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they're on the edge of their seats, waiting to see when Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity." Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by "The Sun" opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. "EastEnders" – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9 p.m. watershed.
Danielle's final episode was watched by an average of 11.46 million viewers, peaking at 11.5 million during its broadcast, and attaining a 48.3% audience share. A further 1.2 million viewers watched the episode's repeat on BBC Three later that evening. The high ratings caused a power surge more than double the national average, seeing a grid surge of 1270MW compared to the 550MW usually experienced during "EastEnders" episodes. A National Grid spokeswoman commented that the surge was "equivalent to around half a million kettles being switched on at once."

David Levine (politician)

David Levine (March 18, 1883–May 9, 1972) was a Seattle, Washington politician. He served on the Seattle City Council from 1931 to 1962 (with a one-year interruption in the mid-1930s) including several stints as council president. On retirement, he received the title of Council President Emeritus, unique in the city's history.
Life.
Born in Kiev in 1883, Levine came to Seattle in 1900. Prior to his political career, he worked as a jeweler and watchmaker. In 1929, he served on a City Planning Commission, a role he would play again from 1964 to 1970 after retiring from the city council. An active trade unionist, as a young man he was a member of the Socialist Labor Party and later was president of the Seattle Central Labor Council, international vice president of the Jewelry Workers' Union, (a role in which he continued while in public office) and editor of "State Labor News". From 1953, he also served as a director of the Seattle Federal Savings & Loan Association. He was also a Freemason, a member of the Order of the Eastern Star and the Elks Club, and of Temple de Hirsch, a Reform Jewish congregation. Despite his membership in a Reform congregation, he often attended an Orthodox synagogue on the High Holy Days.
In the 1920s, Levine had supported reformist mayor Bertha K. Landes and, according to his own account was surprised when he was appointed to the City Planning Commission by Mayor Frank E. Edwards, her successor who defeated her in an election. Levine was appointed to the city council July 14, 1931 to fill a vacancy left when Mayor Edwards was recalled in a special election the previous day. The council elected its own president, Robert H. Harlin as mayor and Levine was selected to fill his unexpired council term.
He was repeatedly re-elected by the public, serving over three decades on the council, and serving as council president in 1934–35, 1938–39, 1941–42, 1950–54, and 1956-62. Nard Jones describes him as having been "virtually mayor as far as power and action went." His sole electoral defeat came in 1935, when a political insurgency by a young men's group called the New Order of Cincinnatus brought three new members to the council, including Arthur B. Langlie, later governor.
Levine served over 250 times as the city's acting mayor and described himself as "flattered" by suggestions that he run for mayor, but he chose never to do so. On November 2, 1953, with Mayor Allan Pomeroy out of town, Levine as acting mayor signed the ordinances enacting the annexation to the city of the area from N 85th Street to N 145th Street, adding 40,800 people and to the city. 
Levine played an important role in the management of the city's finances, to the point that A. A. Lemieux, president of Seattle University dubbed him the "watchdog of the city treasury". The "Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce" described him in 1958 as having "specialized in municipal finance" and "credited with saving the taxpayers millions of dollars"; four years later, upon his retirement, they praised his "prudence and thrift" on behalf of the city. At the time he announced his retirement, the "Seattle Times" said that "more than any other single individual" Levine had been responsible over the years for Seattle's "operation in the 'black'" and added that "His budget-balancing feats are widely recognized by municipal officials across the nation."
Levine was also known as a supporter of public housing including, in particular, the pioneering Yesler Terrace development.
After retiring from the council, he retained until 1968 a small office at city hall and what Jones characterizes as the "mostly honorary" title of "adviser to the mayor". During this era, by his own account, he never gave unsolicited advice, but "f someone in city government asks my opinion on a question I'll give it…" He served on the boards of the Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle World's Fair), the Seattle Municipal League (the "Muni League"), and on the Seattle Center Advisory Commission, the Metro Council, the Board of Administration, the City Employees' Retirement System, the Firemen's Pension Board, the Police Pension Board, and the city's Board of Investment.

South Saint Paul High School (also known as South Saint Paul Secondary) is a public high school in South St. Paul, Minnesota, United States. Located high on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, it is a public school of just over 1,400 students, grades 7-12. 
Approximately 54% of our students go on to a four-year college or university, and about 20% to junior college or technical school. The high school graduated its first class in 1908. Our IB World School, with its state-of-the-art technology, is a source of pride for citizens of this hard-working community located just across the river from downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.
South St. Paul High School is an authorized International Baccalaureate World School aiming for high student achievement and a safe, caring, learning environment. The school features the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Program (MYP) for grades 7-10 and the IB Diploma Program (DP) for students in grades 11 and 12. 
Recognized for providing students with a wide variety of course opportunities that include core academic areas in addition to arts, technology, world language, fine arts, health, and physical education. The goal is to help develop students into well-balanced, grounded, inquisitive and effective thinking scholars.
The school’s team name, the Kaposia Packers, reveals the history of the community; Kaposia for the Kaposia Indians who were founded in South St. Paul and Packers, for the former center of the meat-packing industry, in honor of what was once the world's largest stockyards located on the banks of the Mississippi River. Celebrating its 100th graduating class in 2007, South Saint Paul High School is the only high school in Special School District 6.
Middle Years Program.
The Middle Years Program (MYP) embraces the middle-school philosophy of balancing basic skills, exploratory classes, and International Baccalaureate (IB) programming. It includes all students in grades seven through ten. As part of the Middle Years Program, a student studies eight traditional subjects each year which are organized around a framework for learning that is especially appropriate for the development of students in this age group. The program has no external assessments. However, in each subject area students must be assessed according to criteria established by the International Baccalaureate Organization.
The core curriculum includes a strong foundation in the areas of Math, Science, Language, and Social Studies. A six period day provides possible electives which include World Language, Industrial Technology, Computers, Physical Education, Health, Band, General Music, Visual Art, and Choir for students in grades seven and eight.

IB Diploma Program.
The International Baccalaureate Diploma Program is a challenging course of studies for high school students. At the end of each IB course, students take exams that are externally assessed – the students' work is sent off to be graded by IB examiners from around the world. Colleges and universities appreciate the value of the IB curriculum and assessments, and they often offer advanced placement and credit to students who score well on exams. South St. Paul High School's IB Program has been in place since 1986.

Hayford ellipsoid

The Hayford ellipsoid is a geodetic reference ellipsoid, named after the US geodesist John Fillmore Hayford (1868-1925), which was introduced in 1910. The Hayford ellipsoid was also referred to as the International ellipsoid 1924 after it had been adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics IUGG in 1924, and was recommended for use all over the world. Many countries retained their previous ellipsoids.
The Hayford ellipsoid is defined by its semi-major axis a = 6,378,388.000 and its flattening f = 1:297.00. Unlike some of its predecessors, such as the Bessel ellipsoid (a = 6,377,397 m, f = 1:299,15), which was a European ellipsoid, the Hayford ellipsoid also included measurements from North America, as well as other continents (to a lesser extent). It also included isostatic measurements to reduce plumbline divergences. Hayfords ellipsoid did not reach the accuracy of Helmerts ellipsoid published 1906 (a = 6378 200 m ; Erdabplattung f = 1 : 298.3).
It has since been replaced as the "International ellipsoid" by the newer Lucerne ellipsoid (1967), GRS 80 (1980) and WGS 84 (1984).

Wake Up Sid

Wake Up Sid is a 2009 Bollywood coming of age film. It is directed by Ayan Mukerji, produced by Karan Johar's Dharma Productions, distributed by UTV Motion Pictures, and has visual effects by the Prime Focus Group. The film takes place in contemporary Mumbai and tells the story of spoiled, careless rich-kid Sid Mehra (Ranbir Kapoor), a college student who is taught the meaning of life by Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), an aspiring writer from Calcutta. It was critically and commercially successful. Ranbir Kapoor won numerous awards for his performance.
Plot.
Siddharth "Sid" Mehra (Ranbir Kapoor) is the spoiled, carefree son of wealthy businessman Ram Mehra (Anupam Kher). A resident of Mumbai, his only interest is to have fun and spend his father's money. Thus, he spends little time at college and is not prepared for the final exams. His father, not being aware of this fact, tells Sid it is time to join his company, which Sid reluctantly does only after his father tempts him with the promise of a new car.
Sid meets Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), an aspiring writer. On their first meeting, they go out on a walk along the streets of Bombay. Sid shows her the city and takes her by the sea. They strike a chord instantly and a friendship ensues. Sid helps her to find and furnish her own apartment. She also lands a job with "Mumbai Beat", (based on "Time Out! Mumbai")[http://www.timeoutmumbai.net/film/film_details.asp?code=266&source=5] a hip magazine run by the handsome editor-in-chief Kabir (Rahul Khanna). On the eve of her 27th birthday, Aisha invites Sid to her place. When Sid tentatively explores moving their relationship beyond friendship, he finds that Aisha perceives him as boyish and immature. Despite feeling hurt, he maintains his friendship with her.
When the exam results come out, Sid finds that he failed. His failure leads to an intense family fight that ends with him moving out. With nowhere to go, Sid (who has never been on his own) asks Aisha if he can stay with her. Aisha is initially happy to have the company. When she finds out he has not eaten all day, Ayesha is amused by the fact that Sid cannot cook and does not know how to feed himself. Sid leaves her place a mess and throws tantrums. Over time, Sid learns that to care for himself, he has to begin cooking and cleaning. He also realizes he must work, and Aisha helps him become a photography intern at the magazine she works for.
Aisha is ecstatic when Kabir selects her article for the magazine and asks her on a date. However, she realizes she does not have much in common with him. She then understands that she is in love with Sid. As Sid begins working, he finds meaning in life. He begins to see for the first time how his behavior has hurt his loved ones and that he needs to change his ways. After he is hired as full-time staff and receives his first paycheck, he meets his father. They reconcile and Sid's father asks him to come home. Sid, who often considers himself a burden on Aisha, tells her that he won't be dependent on her anymore and expects her to be thrilled. He doesn't realise that Aisha has fallen in love with him and thus is furious to hear that he is leaving. His departure is a hostile one.
When Sid returns home, he thinks constantly of Aisha, though he does not consider that she might share his feelings, since she told him they can only be friends. When the latest issue of "Mumbai Beat" arrives, Sid reads Aisha's column and is startled to discover that it is about her feelings for him. As it starts raining, he rushes to meet her at the same beach where they had gone the day they met. Sid expresses his love for her and the two embrace.

Critical reception.
"Wake Up Sid" was well received by a number of critics. Subhash K. Jha (film critic and author of "The Essential Guide to Bollywood") gave "Wake Up Sid" a rave review stating that it is, "a triumph on many levels. It takes the protagonist's predictable but yet kinetic voyage into self-realization to a level where the languorous plot exudes a beam of light that cuts right across the radiant narrative [...] The most obtainable component of young Ayan Mukherjee's artless narrative is the remarkable rhythms of the ordinary and the unostentatious in the narrative. All the relationships in the plot are potentially predictable and cliched. Ayan takes the age-old dramatic conflicts of our commercial cinema into quiet supremely understated corridors." Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three out of five stars, stating that "Wake Up Sid", "has its heart in the right place and it marks the breakout of a bright, shining star who has come into his own so early in his acting career. Watch it, and be awestruck by Ranbir." Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out of five stars as well as a "thumbs up" stating that it is "strongly recommended."
Mayank Shekhar of the "Hindustan Times" gave it 3.5 out of four stars and states, ""Wake Up Sid" belongs to a sweet genre that, without doubt, flows on from Farhan Akhtar's "Dil Chahta Hai": part Hollywood; part Bollywood; mostly coming-of-age; subtly romantic; largely original; authentic in feel; light in weight; English in expression; Hindi in language." Avijit Ghosh of "The Times of India" gave it three and half out of four stars and suggests that, ""Wake Up Sid" becomes a sort of template of how GenNow navigate their lives: deal with their own little rebellions, find meaning to their own definitions of independence and handle their own set of mistakes. It feels good when the two friends finally meet in driving rain under the grey skies by the sea. Refreshing and heart-warming, "Wake Up Sid" really puts you in the mood for love." Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave it three and half out of five stars and praised the director saying, "Ayan Mukerji arrives in style and manages to leave his own mark on the film despite having a producer like Karan Johar whose other productions always tend to have his stamp. "Wake Up Sid" really puts you in the mood for love."
Joginder Tuteja of the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) calls the film "flawless" and gave it three and a half stars. He states: "There are five things that make "Wake Up Sid" a delightful affair. It has a constant flow throughout; no over the top or understated drama; no ultra emotional strangulation of audiences; absolutely no yuppie cool dude act; and last but not the least, this is an original and refreshing story." Rachel Saltz of "The New York Times" argues that: "With no big production numbers (songs play over montage sequences), a quiet style and credible characters, "Wake Up Sid" is Bollywood in an indie mood, a film for people like Aisha and Sid: young and educated. It may not be as hip as "Mumbai Beat", the magazine where the two work, but it shows that Mr. Mukherji is a director to watch."
Controversy.
On 2 October, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena supporters protested to halt the screening of "Wake Up Sid" in Mumbai and Pune. The MNS objected the use of the word "Bombay" instead of "Mumbai" in the movie.
Awards.
2010: Filmfare Awards
Soundtrack.

Reception.
The reactions towards the music were favorable. Chandrima Pal of Rediff gave the album 3.5 stars, stating, "the music sticks to the brief. It is hip, urban and bubbly, and unhurried. And thanks to Shankar Ehsaan Loy's musicianship, it is a slick, well-balanced production". Joginder Tuteja (Bollywood Hungama) gave it 3 stars out of possible 5, suggesting that, "this may not really turn out to be the best seller of the year but should certainly be a perfect fit for the narrative."
Sequel.
Rishi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor confirmed the possibility of a sequel to the film.

Wade-Dahl-Till valve

The Wade-Dahl-Till (WDT) valve is a cerebral shunt developed in 1962 by hydraulic engineer Stanley Wade, author Roald Dahl, and neurosurgeon Kenneth Till.
In 1960, Dahl's son Theo developed hydrocephalus after being struck by a car. A standard Holter shunt was installed to drain excess fluid from his brain; however the shunt jammed too often, causing pain and blindness, risking brain damage and requiring emergency surgery. Till determined that debris accumulated in the hydrocephalic ventricles could clog the slits in the Holter valves, especially with patients, such as Theo, who had bad bleeding in the brain. 
Dahl knew Wade to be an expert in precision hydraulic engineering, from their shared hobby of flying model aircraft. (In addition to building his own model aircraft engines, Wade ran a factory at High Wycombe for producing precision hydraulic pumps.) With Dahl coordinating the efforts of the neurosurgeon and the hydraulic engineer, the team developed a new mechanism using two metal discs, each in a restrictive housing at the end of a short silicone rubber tube. Fluid moving under pressure from below pushed the discs against the tube to prevent retrograde flow; pressure from above moved each disc to the "open" position. As Till reported in "The Lancet", the invention was characterized by “low resistance, ease of sterilisation, no
reflux, robust construction, and negligible risk of blockage”.
By the time the device was perfected, Theo had healed to the point at which it was not necessary for him; however, several thousand other children benefited from the WDT valve before medicine technology progressed beyond it.
The co-inventors agreed never to accept any profit from the invention.

Josef Berg

Josef Berg (March 8, 1927 – February 26, 1971) was a Czech composer, musicologist and librettist. His work represents a remarkable value in the context of Czech music after the World War II.
Life.
From 1946 to 1950 he studied at the Brno Conservatory, in the class of Vilém Petrželka. Simultaneously he attended the music lectures at the Faculty of Philosophy on Brno university given by Jan Racek and Bohumír Štědroň. He worked as a music editor in the Czechoslovak Radio in Brno (1950–53), and also wrote reviews for the journals and newspapers. Later he concentrated exclusively on composing. Berg founded an association of young composers called "Group A". The members of the group strived in their program to connect convincing artistic activity with the new musical language, and also to promote new musical trends in Czechoslovakia.
Style.
Even though the Berg's style was at first influenced by Moravian folk music, his mature compositions are very individual and take advantage of new composition techniques and principles. However, his works are not mere technical exercises. Particularly in chamber music Berg brought spontaneous creative invention. Berg was successful in the field of vocal and scenic music, and composed song cycles to his own lyrics. He also made a number of contributions to the chamber opera genre, including "The Return of Ulysses", "European Tourism", "Breakfast at the Schlankenwald Castle" and "Euphrides in Front of the Gates of Tymenas".

Captain Qwark

Captain Qwark is a fictional character from Insomniac Games' "Ratchet & Clank" video game series. He first appeared in the 2002 video game "Ratchet & Clank" as a game's antagonist. In the series, Qwark is a selfish, deluded coward willing to do daring acts in order to gain money and publicity. He also has been known to temporarily side with the villains and betray his allies in order to save himself. However, as of the end of the third game, he has become much more moral, though he still remains a coward.
Video game reviewers have provided different opinions regarding the character. Some criticized his personality calling he is "idiot" and "coward", while others praised his role as a villain.
Appearances.
In "Ratchet & Clank", he was Drek's secret henchman. Despite being known as a hero, he was being paid money to be Drek's spokesperson of his new artificial planet and took advantage of the offer. Drek noticed Ratchet and Clank's interference with his plans, so had Qwark trick them into a battle with the Blargian Snagglebeast on a training death course. Ratchet and Clank still defeated the monster and survived the death course. Drek was upset with Qwark's failure and ordered Qwark to personally eliminate the duo in a spacefight or he would be fired. Qwark failed again and after being fired, went to try making money selling gadgets as a fake alias "Steve McQwark" (claiming the defective gadgets to be Gadgetron products), such as the Personal Delivery Assistant, which could be used to purchase ammo anywhere away from a Gadgetron vendor, and most notably a device called a "Personal Hygenator".
In "", Qwark served as the main villain. He used his "Steve" alias and attempted to make bolts off his Personal Hygenators. The device caused itching pains for its users and alerted authorities to his scam. Qwark was charged 6 billion bolts in fines to the purchasers, but Qwark was unable to pay the fine and when he tried to flee to Pokitaru, was sent to galactic prison, but escaped by flushing himself down one of the toilets in the prison.
Afterwards, Qwark was assumed lost or dead by authorities. With nobody on his tail, Qwark secretly kidnapped Abercrombie Fizzwidget, the president of the MegaCorp company, and disguised himself as Fizzwidget. Qwark, as Fizzwidget, then hired Ratchet and Clank to retrieve the MegaCorp main Protopet, which was stolen by Angela Cross. Then, Qwark would record himself on TV destroying the Protopets by destroying the main one linked to all the others, thus saving the galaxy and regaining his title as galactic hero. Qwark also planned on placing the blame of the Protopets' destructive nature on Ratchet and Clank.
His plans ultimately failed when he tried to press the button to destroy the lead Protopet. The batteries of the device used to do so were in backwards, and instead it mutated the Protopet into a giant Protopet. The giant Protopet ate Captain Qwark and the device. Ratchet and Clank managed to defeat the giant Protopet which resulted in Qwark and the device being released. Angela Cross then took the device and fixed it so she could fix all of the Protopets. Qwark was then sentenced to take part in the MegaCorp testing facility's painful new "Crotchitizer" invention as punishment for his crimes.
In "", Qwark fled to the Florana jungles after leaving the MegaCorp testing facility. He had gone mad and forgotten everything previous to joining the monkeys there. Ratchet and Clank had heard he previously had defeated Dr. Nefarious and were sent by the galactic president to search Florana for him. They captured Qwark and brought him aboard the Starship Phoenix, where Ratchet and Clank played Qwark's vid-comics to refresh his memory.
Once remembering his past life, Qwark was assigned as leader of the Starship Phoenix by the galactic president in the task of taking down Dr. Nefarious again, who had returned and was seeking to turn the whole universe into robots. Qwark mainly sent Ratchet and Clank out to do all the dangerous work while he sat around and took all the credit.
Ratchet and Clank eventually found out that Nefarious was aboard a starship called the Leviathan. The duo went with Qwark and Scrunch (a monkey) to confront the villain. Nefarious had turned out to have tricked them and ordered his butler, Lawrence, to teleport him off the Leviathan as he activated the self-destruct system. Qwark elected to stay behind because he said he saw something important. The ship blew up and it was assumed that Qwark died with the Leviathan.
In reality, Qwark had faked his death so he could stop helping the defeat of Nefarious and instead could retreat to his house to live a lazy life of eating and watching TV. Ratchet and Clank found him and were frustrated with his cowardice, but he still refused to help. Shockingly, in the final battle against Nefarious, Qwark returned in his starship to help defeat him.
In "", Qwark plays a minor role and only appears as a voice over at the end claiming that the whole hero-kidnapping business was rubbish as no one ever tried to kidnap him, as Ratchet and his friends escape from the ruins of the Colosseum.
In "", Qwark began following Ratchet and Clank to see what they were doing in hopes of joining them in their next adventure. Ratchet and Clank agreed to let Qwark use their ship's computer to research his family history in return for him leaving them alone. Qwark found that his dad was Emperor Otto Destruct of the Technomites, who was planning to make himself big and begin getting credit for all the work he did. After Ratchet and Clank defeated Otto, however, Qwark discovered he was wrong and his parents were killed by defective Technomite technology. He put Otto in Otto's Intelligence Machine, planned to use to trade his intelligence with Otto's intelligence. Otto used his shrink device to shrink Qwark before it happened, but because of that, was given the intelligence of Skrunch the monkey instead of Qwark. Tiny Qwark was taken to Ratchet and Clank's apartment where they kept him hostage there. In the following games, Qwark has somehow returned to normal size.
In "", Qwark sends a distress call to Ratchet and Clank after he is attacked by Emperor Tachyon's forces. Though he appears to side with Tachyon, he is in fact working as a double agent, helping Ratchet and Clank from behind the scenes. He later attempts to destroy the Dimensionator, but only ends up accidentally giving Tachyon the device. He is present when the Zoni kidnap Clank.
In "", he actively assists Ratchet in rescuing Clank from Dr. Nefarious at various points throughout the game. First he accompanies Ratchet through an early portion of the story, breaking down otherwise impassable doors and obstacles. He was soon captured by the evil Lord Vorselon and taken to his warship along with a large group of aliens called Fongoids. Soon, Ratchet confronts Vorselon and frees Qwark and the Fongoids, who leave the ship using an escape pod. Later on, Ratchet finds him at the Battleplex, where they team up to take on the War Grok; After Ratchet defeats it, The announcer demands they kill it. Qwark delivers a heartfelt speech about heroics, which changes the attitude of the crowd, and they spare the War Grok; Qwark then decides to keep it as a pet, naming it Snowball. After that, Qwark goes undercover as "Nurse Shannon" and infiltrates Nefarious' base. A newly reunited Ratchet and Clank soon show up and together the three fight through waves of enemies, though eventually get captured by several robots and Ratchet and Clank are thrown into space. Later, Qwark and Snowball are seen fighting Nefarious' troops while Ratchet and Clank go to confront Nefarious. After the game, a cutscene reveals Qwark and Snowball flowing through space on a small asteroid, ending with Snowball becoming hungry and presumably eating Qwark off-screen.
The upcoming comic book mini-series reveals Qwark survived and has become the new Galactic President of Polaris. He calls Ratchet and Clank to investigate the disappearance of several planets.
Conception and creation.
Captain Qwark was a late addition in "Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando"; halfway through production of the game, the development team, having missed the character, shoehorned him into the game with a series of vignettes before making him the main villain of the game.
Reception.
In his review of "Ratchet & Clank", Gavin Frankle of Allgame stated that Captain Qwark's scenes (along with Chairman Drek's) proved to be more entertaining than those of the main characters. He was included in GameSpot's "All Time Greatest Video Game Villain" contest and reached the "Round 2" before losing to General RAAM. IGN ranked him 54th on their list of "The Top 100 Videogame Villains", saying Qwark's "biggest fault, [...], is his cowardice". Qwark was listed by GamesRadar on its "The Top 7 Bestest Frenemies". In 2012, ScrewAttack ranked him as the tenth "douchiest" video game character, adding he is very similar to Groose from "Skyward Sword" and Zapp Brannigan from "Futurama", and "is an idiot... and a coward."

<doc id="18498857" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18498857" title="Utah State Route 181">
Utah State Route 181

State Route 181 (SR-181) was a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah connecting SR-152 in Murray and Holladay north to SR-186 in Salt Lake City at its peak, the former being suburbs of the latter. The route was for thirty-eight years before being truncated in 2007 and decommissioned entirely later in the same year.
When the route was formed in 1935, it went from U.S. Route 89/U.S. Route 91 (US-89/US-91) near North Salt Lake southeast to the Utah State Capitol, then south on State Street, east on South Temple, and south again on 1300 East to US-40 in Salt Lake City. The route was eventually truncated south to SR-186 and extended south to SR-152, then decommissioned north of SR-171 in 2007 and deleted entirely the same year.
The residential and institutional land uses along the route contrast sharply with the nearby and nearly parallel route formed by 1100 East and Highland Drive (part of former SR-152), which has commercial and retail uses along a very high percentage of its length, and SR-181 in effect served as a bypass of the congestion associated with that commercial development.
Route description.
SR-181 began at the modern border of Murray and Holladay at the intersection of SR-152 and 1300 East and headed north on the latter on a two-lane undivided highway, as it was for most of the route (The portion of 1300 East south of SR-152, which was never state maintained, is actually much wider than most of SR-181). In the route's first two miles (mostly within modern Millcreek Township), a small military logistics facility and St. Mark's Hospital were located on the west side, the latter at the junction with 3900 South. Further north, SR-181 crossed over Mill Creek and then immediately climbed a steep hill to cross the Jordan and Salt Lake Canal just before intersecting SR-171 (3300 South) and entering Salt Lake City. From this point on, the route ran along the top of the nearly-continuous escarpment dividing the East Bench of the Salt Lake Valley from lower-lying land to the west; the escarpment coincidentally runs almost perfectly north-to-south.
The highway expanded to four lanes past SR-171 and veered northwesterly through a major commercial area, therefore going slightly out of the alignment of 1300 East in the Salt Lake County grid system and becoming Richmond Street through southern Highland Park. This was brief, however, and it returned to 1300 East on the grid alignment past Highland Drive and reverted to its original direction in northern Highland Park. At Highland Drive, the highway widened to six lanes (plus, for the first time, frontage roads on the west side). SR-181 continued north to intersect I-80, Parley's Creek (with Parley's Trail, still under construction as of 2012), and 2100 South in Sugar House (next to Sugar House Park, the former Sugar House Prison), where it lost four of its six lanes. This stretch of road, from 2100 South north to 1300 South, was frequently congested. After the crossing of Emigration Creek, Westminster College and the Frank M. and Susan E. Ulmer House were located on the west side of the road on this segment, while the Wasatch Hollow neighborhood was on the east side. The route gained a lane in the southbound section past 1300 South and another lane in the northbound section by 900 South, but these extra lanes have been removed in favor of bicycle lanes, center turn lanes, and extra parking since Salt Lake City took ownership of the road. Beyond 900 South, the road passed east of East High School. It continued in this matter to its terminus at SR-186, near the University of Utah and west of the Rice-Eccles Stadium.
History.
The state legislature formed State Route 181 in 1935, beginning at the junction of US-89/US-91 (now solely US-89) and going southeast on Victory Road to the Utah State Capitol. It then went south on State Street to South Temple, turned east on that street and then turned south on 1300 East. It continued south to US-40 (2100 South), where it terminated. In 1957, the highway was extended south by Commission to 1300 East (SR-152), which at that time ran along Highland Drive in Sugar House. In 1961, the highway was extended further south to 3300 South (SR-171). Another southward extension in 1969 brought the route to SR-152, which at that time was running along the Van Winkle Expressway.
In the early 1990s, traffic planners planned to relieve the congestion that was affecting the two-lane section of the route between 2100 South and 1300 South by implementing a center reversible lane. The reversible lane would have flowed in a northbound direction in the morning and a southbound direction in the evening. There would also be eight overhead signals spaced about a block apart each reminding motorists what direction the lane was flowing in. However, this plan never came to fruition due to local opposition over safety and cost and was canceled at the end of 1993. On 17 October 2007, the portion of the route in Salt Lake City city limits (north of SR-171) was transferred to the city's ownership. On 7 December of the same year, the remainder of the route was transferred to Salt Lake County's jurisdiction.
Major intersections.
This table reflects the routing 1969–17 October 2007. The entire route was in Salt Lake County.

The development of the first Bulgarian micrcomputer started back in 1979 at the Institute for technical cybernetics and robotics. The first working samples were manufactured in 1980. The abbreviation IMKO means Individualen Mikro KOmputur (Individual Micro COmputer). This model is an analogue of Apple II Plus and only about 50 units were manufactured for testing purposes.
Start of production: 1980.
End of production: 1982.
Processor: 6502/1Mhz.
Memory (RAM): 48KB (with the possibility to extend to 64KB).
Memory (ROM): 12KB.
Disk drives: No disk drives available, only a cassette player port.
Operating system: None.
Screen resolution: Text mode 40x24 (columns/rows), graphics mode 280x192 pixels - 6 colours,
280x160 pixels + 4 text rows, 40x40 pixels + 4 text rows, 40x48 pixels in 16 colours.
Variations: None.
Notes: Manufactured as an experimental model at the Institute for cybernetics and robotics 
at the Bulgarian Academy of Science. It was well accepted due to its low price for its time as well 
as due to its universal features and ease of use. It was first presented to the foreign audience in 
1981 at the symposium on robotics in England as part of the demonstration of a robot arm (ROBKO-01).At that time the robots in Japan and the USA were controlled by minicomputers, not microcomputers like IMKO-1 and this demonstration was a real success as the whole system cost tens of times less than the Japanese or American analogues. As all computers of the Pravetz series this model has hardware Cyrillic support, but due to the fact that the keyboard was using 7 bits for transmitting the character codes the Cyrillic letters were overlapping the lower case Latin letters and it was only possible to type with upper case Latin or Cyrillic letters.
Ports/slots: Cassette player port, 8 expansion slots. The zero slot was used for attaching extra 
memory up to the 64KB limit.
Manufacterer: ITCR - Sofia.

<doc id="18498968" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18498968" title="Falling (accident)">
Falling (accident)

Falling is the second leading cause of accidental death worldwide and is a major cause of personal injury, especially for the elderly. Builders, electricians, miners, and painters are occupations with high rates of fall injuries. The World Health Organization estimates that as of 2010 that 540,000 people die from falls.
Causes.
Elderly.
In elderly, even falls from standing position to flat ground may cause serious injuries. Stephen Lord at the University of New South Wales studied 80,000 elderly persons in Australia and found that the risk of falling increases for any who are taking multiple prescription medications and for all who are taking psychoactive drugs. This increased risk was demonstrated through the use of a variety of balance and reaction time tests. Older men when matched with women of identical height, weight, and age, on average, performed measurably better in all of the balance and reaction time tests.
Workplace.
In the occupational setting, falling incidents are commonly referred to as slips, trips, and falls (STFs). Falls from elevation hazards are present at almost every jobsite, and many workers are exposed to these hazards daily. As such, falls are an important topic for occupational safety and health services. Any walking/working surface could be a potential fall hazard. An unprotected side or edge which is or more above a lower level should be protected from falling by the use of a guard rail system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system. These hazardous exposures exist in many forms, and can be as seemingly innocuous as changing a light bulb from a step ladder to something as high-risk as installing bolts on high steel at in the air. In 2000, 717 workers died of injuries caused by falls from ladders, scaffolds, buildings, or other elevations. More recent data in 2011, found that STFs contributed to 14% of all workplace fatalities in the United States that year.
Companies must make sure that they follow the applicable safety legislation (e.g. the Occupational Safety and Health Act in the United States) to keep the work environment safe.
Risk factors.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has compiled certain known risk factors that have been found responsible for STFs in the workplace setting. While falling can occur at any time and by any means in the workplace, these factors have been known to cause same-level falls, which are less likely to occur than falls to a lower level.
Workplace factors: Spills on walking surfaces, Ice, snow or rain, Loose mats or rugs, Boxes/containers, Poor lighting, Uneven walking surfaces
Work organization factors: Fast work pace, Work tasks involving liquids or greases
Individual factors: Age, Employee fatigue, Failing eyesight / use of bifocals, Inappropriate, loose, or poor-fitting footwear
Self harm.
Falls from buildings are often accidental but can also be caused intentionally, such as by defenestration. Injuries caused by falls from buildings vary depending on the building's height and the age of the person. Falls from the second floor (American; first floor European) usually cause injuries, but are not fatal.
Height and severity.
The severity of injury increases with the height of the fall, but also depends on body and surface features and the manner of body impacts on to the surface. The chance of surviving increases if landing on the surface of high deformity (a surface that bends, moves, or compresses), such as snow or water.
Overall, the height at which 50% of children die from a fall is between four and five storey heights (around ) above the ground.
Epidemiology.
[[Image:Falls world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Disability-adjusted life year for falls per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
In 2010 falls resulted in 540,000 deaths up from 350,000 in 1990, making them the second most common cause of death from unintentional injuries after motor vehicle collisions. They were the most common cause of injury seen in emergency departments in the United States. One study found that there were nearly 7.9 million emergency department visits involving falls, nearly 35.7% of all encounters.

Life.
Saniz Mirza succeeded his father upon his death in 1457 or 1458. Choosing to establish himself in Yarkand, he gave Kashgar and Yangi Hisar to his brother Muhammad Haidar Mirza and the latter's mother Urun Sultan Khanim.
As a supporter of the Moghul khan Yunus Khan, Saniz Mirza soon came into conflict with his brother, who supported Yunus' rival Dost Muhammad Khan. As a result, Muhammad Haidar fled to Aksu, which was under the control of Dost Muhammad, while Saniz Mirza regained control of Kashgar.
In 1464 or 1465 Saniz Mirza was wounded in a hunting accident. He soon died of his wounds; upon his death Dost Muhammad came down to Yarkand and demanded Saniz Mirza's widow, who he married upon her surrender. He also received the latter's children (including Mirza Abu Bakr), whom he brought back with him to Aksu.
The Dughlat historian Mirza Muhammad Haidar characterized Saniz Mirza as a "violent, but generous man".

Johansson was born on September 26, 1984 in Avesta, a locality of 15,000 people in Dalarna province of Sweden. He had broken a clavicle at birth, a minor defect which he still carries. Johansson participated in various sports as a child, including hockey, track and field athletics, skiing and table tennis. Hockey was his favorite sport, but as he was small and skinny (just over 50 kg at the age of 16), he had to abandon it at the age of 13-14. He switched to skiing in winter and running in summer, combining both with orienteering and training in the club IFK Mora. Extensive training gradually his built muscles and success in local competitions, both in ski and foot orienteering. Overtraining put him out of competitions for 6 month before the 2004 season. However, he recovered and won silver in ski relay in Vuokatti 2004 Junior World Orienteering Championship, as well as gold in relay and silver in long distance at the Gdansk 2004 Junior World foot Orienteering Championship.
Foot orienteering.
In 2005, Johansson debuted in adult competitions. Although he was a Swedish champion in sprint, he was not included into the Swedish team for the 2005 World Orienteering Championship (WOC), however he was competing for the team in other events. At the Kiev 2007 WOC he had collapsed on the long distance run, but amazingly recovered to win bronze medal in the sprint just a few days after that. Before the next WOC in Olomouc, 2008 he had a serious toe injury, but recovered and again won a bronze medal in sprint.
2009 WOC injury.
His injuries did not stop and the most serious one came during the 2009 WOC in Miskolc, Hungary. He finished 5th in sprint and his next discipline was relay on August 21. The Swedish team was battling for the victory with France and Norway, and each team put the strongest runner on the last leg. French Thierry Gueorgiou was a favorite and was leading the race, but made an orienting mistake and fell behind Johansson. At the end of the race, Johansson got injured in an event witnessed by nobody, including Johansson himself. He described it as he was running downhill and suddenly something hit him in a quadriceps. He made a few steps, but had to stop and found a big tree branch sticking out of his leg. He fell and panicked anticipating a splash of blood, but saw Gueorgiou coming and yelled for help. Gueorgiou stopped and was soon joined by Norwegian Anders Nordberg and Czech Michal Smola. Johansson told them to keep running, but they refused and started working as a team. Nordberg ran to the finish line for help, whereas Gueorgiou and Smola removed the branch, which pierced the leg to a 12-cm depth, and harnessed the wound using Gueorgiou's shirt and the straps of his GPS device. Then they carried Johansson, who passed out several times in the meantime, to the road where an ambulance car was waiting. After Johansson was on his way to the hospital, Smola, Gueorgiou and Nordberg continued the course. They jogged together finishing at 25th, 26th, and 27th places.
All of this was witnessed by spectators worldwide who were following the men's relay race, via GPS tracking shown live on the Internet. Foot orienteering races are cross-country, off-rail races and the preferred route choice often is through forests. Thus spectators have limited access on course. Spectators who were watching a map of the race in progress witnessed the strange behavior of the four leaders' GPS tracks – the tracks stopped. Soon Nordberg’s track started moving again, but it went to the road and then to the finish area. Viewer-controlled replays of the race are available for analysis, in a RouteGadget web tool.
Interpretation of International Orienteering Federation (IOF) competition rules was at issue: rule 26.13 states "The organiser must void a competition if at any point it becomes clear that circumstances have arisen which make the competition unfair or dangerous for the competitors. After much deliberation on whether or not to void the relay, the organizers declared that it stood. IOF president Åke Jacobson told Gueorgiou, Nordberg and Smola "What you did today is a great example of extreme sportsmanship and fair play. You are an inspiration for all of us!" As an orienteering relay team has 3 runners, orienteers have dubbed Gueorgiou, Nordberg and Smola "Team Fairplay".
Johansson underwent an operation to clean the infection in his wound. The operation went successfully and already on August 26, 2009 he returned home, praising Hungarian doctors.
Ski.
At the Junior World Ski Orienteering Championships in Vuokatti, Finland in 2004, apart from the silver in relay, Johansson also finished 5th in the "long distance" and 6th in the "short distance" disciplines. As a strong cross-country skier, he participated in the 2006 Vasaloppet – a 90-km race held annually in northwestern Dalarna, Sweden, the oldest and one of the biggest cross-country ski marathon in the world. He was in the front group, but finished around 50th place. He also represented Sweden at the cross-country skiing World Championship in 2007.
Trivia.
As of August 28, 2009, Johansson was placed 7th at the World foot-orienteering ranking qualification. His best results were achieved at the World Cups – two bronze medals in sprint and long run in 2007 and a gold medal the long run in Oslo 2009. His best WOC results are two bronze medals in sprint, and his best WOC achievements in other disciplines are more modest – 9th in the long run and 8th in relay, both in Olomouc 2008. He did not compete in the WOC middle run. 
Johansson participated in the European Orienteering Championship (foot) in Ventspils Latvia (2008) and was 5th in the long distance, 12th in sprint and 6th in relay. When free from sport, Johansson is studying construction engineering. He has two sisters and one brother.

Falling (sensation)

A sensation of falling occurs when the labyrinth or "vestibular apparatus", a system of fluid-filled passages in the inner ear, detects changes in acceleration. This sensation can occur when a person begins to fall, which in terms of mechanics amounts to a sudden acceleration increase from zero to roughly 9.8 m/s2. However, once the body is in free fall (for example, during skydiving), there is no falling sensation. While velocity continues to increase, the downward acceleration due to gravity remains constant and is not sensed. Increasing drag force may even cause a feeling of ascent.
The vestibular apparatus also detects spatial orientation with respect to visual input. A similar sensation of falling can be induced when the eyes detect rapid apparent motion with respect to the environment. This system enables us to keep our balance by signalling when a physical correction is necessary. Some medical conditions, known as balance disorders, also induce the sensation of falling. In the early stages of sleep, a falling sensation may be perceived in connection with a hypnic jerk, sometimes awaking the sleeper abruptly.
Labyrinth.
The vestibular system works with other sensorimotor systems in the body, such as visual system (eyes) and skeletal system (bones and joints), to check and maintain the position of our body at rest or in motion. The vestibular apparatus functions by detecting forces that act upon bodies including gravity. There are two sections in the labyrinth that are helpful for accomplishing those tasks: the semicircular canals and the otolithic organs.
Balance disorder.
A balance disorder is a condition that makes a person feel nausea, disorientation or dizziness, as if moving, spinning or falling even though steady. Balance disorder can be caused by medication, problems of inner ear or the brain.
Hypnic jerk.
Hypnic jerk, also called as hypnagogic jerk, is a kind of sleep disorder that can be caused by anxiety, caffeine, a dream, or discomfort of sleeping. Basically, hypnic jerk is the feeling when people experience a sudden muscle twitch and feel like they are falling while sleeping and sometimes dreaming. About 70% of people have experienced hypnic jerk.
There is no completely accurate explanation of this phenomenon, but most experts agree that as muscles begin to slack right after one falls asleep, the brain senses these relaxation signals and misinterpret as one is falling down. Then the brain will send signals to muscles to keep the balance.
Studies also showed that there is a correlation between the frequency of hypnic jerks and anxiety. Fatigue, discomfort of the bed, highly intense exercise and stress might cause people to jerk during sleeping.

Bavarian A II

The Bavarian A II engines were early German 2-2-2 steam locomotives with the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn").
The locomotives were conceived as Stephenson Long Boiler engines. They had an inside forked frame and the firebox was supported by the trailing axle. The only difference between the engines from the two manufacturers was the location of the feed pump. On the Kessler variant this was on the outside and driven by crank pins; on the Maffei version they were suspended from the reverse eccentric cam ("Rückwärtsexzenter"). 
After it was discovered that the riding qualities of the loco were very rough, the trailing axle was moved about further back. In the 1860s the old boiler on some vehicles was replaced by a Crampton boiler. In addition, six engines were rebuilt with a wheel arrangement of 0-6-0 and three into 0-4-2 locomotives. The remainder were taken out of service between 1871 and 1877 and scrapped.
They were coupled with 2 T 4.2 tenders.

Screamin' Demon

<br>
The Screamin' Demon was a shuttle loop roller coaster at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. Designed by Arrow Development, it opened in 1977 as one of the first looping roller coasters in the United States to run both forward and backward. After ten years of operation, the ride was moved to Camden Park. 
History.
Anton Schwarzkopf and Intamin AG co-developed the first shuttle loop design, which opened as King Kobra at Kings Dominion in 1977. A total of six shuttle loop roller coasters opened that same year throughout the United States. Screamin' Demon had the distinction of being the first from Arrow Development to open to the public. Unlike the vertical tracks used as reverse points at both ends on the King Kobra, Arrow used loading platforms instead.
At the end of the 1987 season, the ride was sold and relocated to Camden Park in West Virginia where it was renamed to "Thunderbolt Express". It was closed in 2000 and never reopened. It was eventually scrapped in 2004.
Ride experience.
After riders board a train in the loading station, they are launched forward into an immediate drop. The propulsion system consists of an electric motor and pulley system. The drop leads into a vertical loop as riders experience a maximum of 4 g. The train exits the loop and ascends to a horizontal section of track similar in length to the loading station. After coming to complete stop for a brief moment, the train in launched in reverse to repeat the course and return to the loading station.

Fama–French three-factor model

In asset pricing and portfolio management the Fama–French three-factor model is a model designed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French to describe stock returns. Fama and French were professors at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
The traditional asset pricing model, known formally as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) uses only one variable to describe the returns of a portfolio or stock with the returns of the market as a whole. In contrast, the Fama–French model uses three variables. Fama and French started with the observation that two classes of stocks have tended to do better than the market as a whole: (i) small caps and (ii) stocks with a high book-to-market ratio (BtM, customarily called value stocks, contrasted with growth stocks). They then added two factors to CAPM to reflect a portfolio's exposure to these two classes:
Here r is the portfolio's expected rate of return, "R""f" is the risk-free return rate, and "K""m" is the return of the market portfolio. The "three factor" "β" is analogous to the classical "β" but not equal to it, since there are now two additional factors to do some of the work. "SMB" stands for "Small capitalization Minus Big" and "HML" for "High ratio Minus Low"; they measure the historic excess returns of small caps over big caps and of value stocks over growth stocks. These factors are calculated with combinations of portfolios composed by ranked stocks (BtM ranking, Cap ranking) and available historical market data. Historical values may be accessed on Kenneth French's web page.
Moreover, once SMB and HML are defined, the corresponding coefficients "b""s" and "b""v" are determined by linear regressions and can take negative values as well as positive values. The Fama–French three-factor model explains over 90% of the diversified portfolios returns, compared with the average 70% given by the CAPM (within sample). The signs of the coefficients suggested that small cap and value portfolios have higher expected returns — and arguably higher expected risk — than those of large cap and growth portfolios.
Griffin shows that the Fama and French factors are country specific and concludes that the local factors provide a better explanation of time-series variation in stock returns than the global factors. Therefore, updated risk factors are available for other stock markets in the world, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. Eugene Fama and Kenneth French recently analysed models with local and global risk factors for four regions (North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific) and conclude that local factors work better than global factors for regional portfolios. The global and local risk factors may also be accessed on Kenneth French's web page.
A number of studies have reported that when the Fama–French model is applied to emerging markets the book-to-market factor retains its explanatory ability but the market value of equity factor performs poorly. In a recent paper, Foye, Mramor and Pahor (2013) propose an alternative three factor model that replaces the market value of equity component with a term that acts as a proxy for accounting manipulation.

Map-winged Swift

The Map-winged Swift ("Pharmacis fusconebulosa") is a moth belonging to the family Hepialidae. It has a patchy distribution throughout Eurasia. It was previously placed in the genus "Hepialus" and some references still place it there.
This moth gets its common name from the variegated pattern of the forewing, in various shades of black, brown and white, which look rather like a map (although there are plainer forms). Unlike most hepialids, the pattern is rather similar in both sexes although the female is usually rather larger with a wingspan of up to 50 mm.
The adult flies from May to July (August in the north of the range) and is attracted to light, sometimes strongly so. This species overwinters twice as a larva.
This moth is strongly associated with bracken ("Pteridium spp") and it is most frequently encountered in habitats where this plant occurs (e.g. moorland, heathland, open woodland). However the larva, which is a root-feeder, has been recorded on other ferns such as "Polystichum", grasses such as red fescue and also on potatoes and probably will feed on a wide range of other plants.

King Cobra (roller coaster)

King Cobra (1984–2001) was a TOGO Stand-up roller coaster located at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. It was the first in the world to be designed from the ground up as a stand-up roller coaster. Other stand-up roller coasters that preceded King Cobra were sit-down models later modified to accommodate stand-up trains. After the ride's manufacturer, TOGO, went out of business in 2001, parts for the ride became more expensive and harder to find. In addition, the ride was losing popularity in recent years. So in April 2002, Paramount Parks decided to dismantle King Cobra and put it up for sale. Trains were sent to Kings Island's "graveyard" located at the old Wild Animal Habitat feeding house area next to the Son of Beast. After the ride wouldn't sell, the decision was made in 2008 to transfer some of the ride including the trains to Kings Dominion to be used as spare parts for Shockwave. As of 2010, remnants of the King Cobra can still be spotted in some back areas of Kings Island near Flight of Fear
Ride experience.
After being loaded into the 24 passenger stand-up trains, the riders were taken up a hill, before turning 180 degrees to the right and encountering the first drop. The riders were first welcomed by the vertical loop, which was taken quickly and smoothly. Shortly after, the train climbed up the first camel-back hill, allowing for some floater airtime, then dropped into a 540-degree helix, which had riders standing almost completely sideways. Upon exiting the helix, the second camel-back hill was encountered and followed by the unique "trick track" section of the ride, where the track was straight, but banked to the left before turning to the right. Before hitting the brake run, the track went over two bunny hills allowing brief moments of airtime before the ride came to a complete stop. The train then turned to the right and was brought back to the station.
Clones and similar attractions.
There are three roller coasters, all of which are still operating, that are similar in design to King Cobra.

Badminton Australia

Badminton Australia (BA) is the top governing body for badminton in Australia. It is committed to promoting the awareness and development of badminton within Australia and is also responsible for the management of international badminton relations + events. Junior events such as the June Bevan Teams Event or CP Maddern Trophy with their respective Australasian Championships, along with the Australian Closed Championships are also organised and run by Badminton Australia.
History.
Badminton has been existent in Australia since the early 1900s, especially within regions in Victoria. The official Australian Badminton Association was formed in 1932, and shortly after, Australia became the 11th member of the International Badminton Federation. In 1936, it founded the development of the Oceania Badminton Confederation alongside New Zealand. This is now known as Badminton Oceania.
The current national office for BA resides in Melbourne, Victoria.
Achievements.
Australia is yet to be a competitive nation in the field of badminton, in the context of current Asian and European/Scandinavian dominance. Its best achievement to this date has been at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where Anna Lao reached the quarterfinals in the ladies singles. Lao also partnered Rhonda Cator to reach the quarterfinals of the women's doubles event as well.
Another noticeable achievement is from a player call Sze Yu. He was runners-up at the 1985 World Badminton Grand Prix. Silver-medallist in men's singles at the 1986 Commonwealth Games. He was also the Winner of the 1988 U.S. Open Badminton Championships.
When commenting on Australian players at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, BA's Chief Executive Paul Brettell has stated that 'A bad draw will see Australian players out after their first game' and that 'Australia's greatest achievement is just qualifying for the event'. These statements reflect the current status of badminton within Australia. 
Further, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, badminton was one of just 2 Australian sports (the other being Rugby Sevens) not to win a medal at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games
Recent performances at the 2008 Olympics have reinforced this viewpoint, with all Australians knocked out of their respective first matches.

The Diary of One Who Disappeared

The Diary of One Who Disappeared () is a song cycle for tenor, alto, three female voices and piano, written by Czech composer Leoš Janáček.
Background.
On May 14, 1916, the "Lidové noviny" newspaper published verses titled ""From a Pen of the Self-taught Writer"". This "diary in poems" tells the story of a village boy who falls in love with the young gipsy girl Zefka (Žofka), and decides to leave his family and village with her. The verses made a deep impression on Leoš Janáček (cooperator of "Lidové noviny" in that time), and he decided to rework the poems into the song cycle. He created a work in twenty-two parts, accompanied by scenic demands. The cycle was composed during August 1917 and June 1919; the last modifications were finished in December 1920. The composer created the work simultaneously with other compositions.
The composition was based on the story of Janáček's friend and late love Kamila Stösslová. Janáček expressed his inclination in the letters to Stösslová, and he mentioned even the inspiration for the character of the gipsy girl Zefka: "...And the black gipsy girl in my Diary of One Who Disappeared – that was you. That´s why there´s so much emotional fire in the work. So much fire that if we both caught on, we´d be turn into ashes. ...And all through the work I thought of you! You were my Žofka. Žofka with a child in her arms, and he runs after her!..."
The Diary was premiered at the "Reduta" Theatre in Brno on 18 April 1921 under the title "The Diary of One Who Disappeared and Never Heard of Again"; the end of the title was later crossed out. The tenor part was performed by Karel Zavřel, the alto by Ludmila Kvapilová-Kudláčková, and piano part played Janáček's student, the pianist and conductor Břetislav Bakala.
In 1943 the work was orchestrated by Ota Zitek and Vaclav Sedláček for a staged performance in Plzen. A recording of this version was made in 1987 (released 1989) by Brigitte Balleys and Philip Langridge with the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado (DG 427 313–2 GH).
Libretto.
The author of the text was originally anonymous. Dr. Jan Mikeska in 1998 identified the author of the poems as the Wallachian writer Ozef Kalda.
Structure.
The cycle consists of twenty-two parts:
The atmosphere of the work is mysterious; it contains emotional strength as well as psychological depth. The piano part bears some impressionist features. The soprano parts were rewritten and lowered by the composer for alto. Approximate duration is 37 minutes.

Joseph Biederman

Joseph Biederman is Chief of the Clinical and Research Programs in Pediatric Psychopharmacology and Adult ADHD at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School. Biederman is Board Certified in General and Child Psychiatry.
Awards and honors.
Biederman received the American Psychiatric Association’s Blanche Ittelson Award for Excellence in Child Psychiatric Research, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry’s Charlotte Norbert Rieger Award for Scientific Achievement. He has been inducted into the CHADD “Hall of Fame”.
In 2007, Biederman was ranked as the second highest producer of high-impact papers in psychiatry overall throughout the world with 235 papers cited a total of 7048 times over the past 10 years as determined by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The same organization ranked Biederman at #1 in terms of total citations to his papers published on ADD/ADHD in the past decade.
Biederman was the recipient of the 1998 NAMI Exemplary Psychiatrist award. He was also selected by the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society Awards committee as the recipient of the 2007 Outstanding Psychiatrist Award for Research. In 2007, Biederman received the Excellence in Research Award from the New England Council of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He was also awarded the Mentorship Award from the Department of Psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital.
Conflict of interest investigations.
Chuck Grassley led a 2008 Congressional Investigation which found that well-known university psychiatrists, who had promoted psychoactive drugs, had violated federal and university regulations by secretly receiving large sums of money from the pharmaceutical companies which made the drugs. Congress investigated charges that Biederman earned consulting fees of at least $1.6 million over eight years from pharmaceutical companies, but did not report much of this income to university officials. Johnson & Johnson gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, and some of its research was about Risperdal, the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment. In 2011, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School disciplined three psychiatrists, including Biederman, for violating conflict of interest polices.

Suzuki FR-50

The Suzuki FR50 was a scooter produced by Suzuki from 1974 to the early 1980s. It was very similar in design to the Suzuki FR80
It was powered by a 49cc, 2-stroke, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine which incorporated a self-mixing system so it had a separate 2-stroke oil tank and petrol tank. It is started by a kick start mechanism which turns over the engine. The engine was quoted as producing 4.4 hp (3.3 kW) @ 6,000 rpm (revolutions per minute) or 5,39 Nm (0,55 kg-m) @ 5,000 rpm
It had a small 6V (six volt) battery fitted and an ignition switch to provide easy starting and for constant and even power to the lights and horn. 
Like the FR80, the engine drives a 3-speed semi-automatic gearbox, with a heel-and-toe gear shift. 
In the early 1970s Suzuki started to import the FR50, followed by the introduction of the FR 50 K an improved
version in 1974, then it was discontinued in August 1975. Production didn't resume until February 1981 in the form of an even further improved version, the FR50 X. 
The FR80 replaced the FR70 in the summer of 1976.

Plague Ship (Cussler novel)

Plague Ship is the 5th installment of the The Oregon Files by Clive Cussler & Jack Du Brul. It is based around a series of violent viral attacks on cruise ships by extremists who want to make half the worlds population sterile.
Plot.
The crew has just completed a top secret mission against Iran to steal a rocket torpedo that was illegally sold to them by the Russian Federation, when they come across a cruise ship adrift at sea. The passengers and crew were killed by a hemorrhagic fever, similar to Ebola, and, as Captain Juan Cabrillo tries to determine what happened, explosions rack the length of the ship. Barely able to escape with his own life and that of the liner's sole survivor, Cabrillo finds himself plunged into a mystery as intricate—and as perilous-as any he has ever known and pitted against a cult with monstrously lethal plans for human race—plans he may already be too late to stop.

Moshavim Movement

The Moshavim Movement (, "Tnu'at HaMoshavim") is one of the main settlement movements in Israel, whose members are cooperative villages organized as moshavim and moshavim shitufiim. Founded in 1920 with the establishment of the first moshav, Nahalal, in the Jezreel Valley in the north of Israel, the movement today has a membership of 253 moshavim from the total of 440 moshavim and moshavim shitufiim in Israel.
The member moshavim have access to a range of mutual help instruments maintained by the Moshavim Movement. These include a mutual insurance company, a mutual help fund, a mortgage bank for moshavim, and a pension and retirement fund for individual moshav members. In the past, the Moshavim Movement created a system of regional service cooperatives ("mif'alim ezoriim" in Hebrew) for supply of farm inputs and for marketing and processing of farm products for its members. These regional cooperatives were essentially similar to those established by the Kibbutz Movement for kibbutzim and included fruit packing and canning facilities, livestock feed mixing centers, poultry and meat processing plants, egg sorting and packing facilities, and refrigerated storage capacities.

SS Königin Luise (1913)

SS "Königin Luise" was a German steam ferry. She operated between Hamburg and Holland, before being taken over by the Kaiserliche Marine on the outbreak of the First World War. She was used as an auxiliary minelayer before being sunk on 5 August 1914.
Construction and early career.
"Königin Luise" was laid down at AG Vulcan Stettin in 1913, and launched on 8 May 1913 for service with the Hamburg America Line. After serving for sometime as a ferry, she was requisitioned by the Kaiserliche Marine on 3 August 1914 to serve as an auxiliary minelayer, carrying 200 naval mines. She was fitted with two revolver cannons, and there were plans to fit her with two 88 mm guns, but the British entry to the war on 4 August led to the navy pressing "Königin Luise" into immediate action. She was disguised in the black, buff, and yellow colours of the steamers of the Great Eastern Railway that sailed between Harwich and the Hook of Holland, and sailed from Emden on the night of 4 August. Her captain, Commander Biermann, had orders to lay mines off the Thames Estuary.
Minelaying and encounter with the British.
"Königin Luise" was able to lay a number of mines off the coast during the night, but was sighted by a number of fishing vessels. The light cruiser "Amphion" of the Harwich Force and a number of destroyers of the 3rd Flotilla sailed early in the morning of 5 August and headed towards Heligoland Bight. On the way they encountered a fishing boat, whose occupants informed the British force that they had seen an unknown ship "throwing things over the side" about 20 miles north of the Outer Gabbard. "Amphion" and the destroyers set off to investigate.
The taskforce spotted "Königin Luise" at 10:25, and the destroyers "Lance" and "Landrail" moved to investigate. "Königin Luise" fled at her top speed, moving into a rain squall, where she proceeded to lay more mines. "Lance" and "Landrail" gave chase, signalling to the rest of the force that they were engaging. "Lance" opened fire, the first British shot of the war. "Amphion" soon closed and also began to fire on the fleeing "Königin Luise". The German ship attempted to escape to neutral waters to the south-east, while leading the pursuing British through her minefield, but under heavy and accurate fire, Commander Biermann ordered the scuttling of the ship. The surviving crew abandoned ship, and the "Königin Luise" rolled over to port and sank at 12:22. 46 of the 100 crew were rescued by the British ships. She was the first German naval loss of the war.
Loss of "Amphion".
The British ships continued their patrol, before heading back to port that evening. Their course took them through the minefield the "Königin Luise" had previously laid, and at 06:45 on the morning of 6 August "Amphion" struck one of the mines. Heavily damaged, she was abandoned, with her crew being taken off by the escorting destroyers. "Amphion" drifted back into the minefield, struck another mine at 07:03 and sank, becoming the first British naval war loss, with those killed being the first British casualties of the war.

Tropical Storm Norman (2006)

Tropical Storm Norman was a weak tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico in October 2006. The twelfth named storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Norman developed on October 9 from a tropical wave well to the southwest of Mexico. Unfavorable conditions quickly encountered the system, and within two days of forming, Norman dissipated as its remnants turned to the east. Thunderstorms gradually increased again, as it interacted with a disturbance to its east, and on October 15 the cyclone regenerated just off the coast of Mexico. The center became disorganized and quickly dissipated, bringing a large area of moisture which dropped up to 6 inches (150 mm) of rainfall to southwestern Mexico. Rainfall from the storm flooded about 150 houses, of which 20 were destroyed. One person was injured, and initially there were reports of two people missing due to the storm; however, it was not later confirmed.
Meteorological history.
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000 UTC on October 9, about 765 mi (1235 km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.
Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving north-northwestward, around the western periphery of a weak ridge; the first forecast advisory by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the depression to gradually intensify before weakening and crossing the Baja California Peninsula. Located over warm water temperatures, the system developed an area of organized, deep convection near the center; with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using the Dvorak technique, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman about 12 hours after it first formed. Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) early on October 10. At the time, it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward. However, some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening and a sharp turn to the southeast. Shortly after peaking in intensity, southwesterly wind shear increased, which led to a decrease in convection coverage. At the same time, a trough extending from California southward caused Norman to stall and turn to the east. The convection rapidly became separated from the center; by late on October 10, the center was located about 115 miles (185 km) from the nearest thunderstorms. By then, it had weakened to tropical depression status, and early on October 11 Norman degenerated into a remnant low about 530 miles (855 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
The remnants of Norman continued to the east, and later to the east-southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance off the coast of Mexico. Initially, re-development of Norman was not expected, as the disturbance was instead given the possibility for further development. On October 13, the NHC noted that the remnants of Norman were merging with the disturbance to its east; during the interaction, convection redeveloped and organized around the remnant low of Norman, and early on October 15 it reformed into a tropical depression, near the coast of southwestern Mexico. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Norman was predicted to re-attain tropical storm status before moving ashore. However, the center quickly became less-organized, turning northward and northwestward within the larger tropical disturbance. Late on October 15, it is estimated Tropical Depression Norman dissipated 23 miles (37 km) south and offshore of Manzanillo, Colima, although satellite imagery suggested the center may have dissipated inland.
Preparations and impact.
When Norman redeveloped into a tropical cyclone, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to Cabo Corrientes.
The storm brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35 inches (161 mm) in La Villita, Michoacán. Flooding from four days of rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150 homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses. In total, 20 homes were destroyed, and 20 villages were left without power. A transport vehicle carrying 15 people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; the truck was later rescued by police workers. About 300 hectares (740 acres) of crop fields sustained damage; however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended. Across Mexico, the storm affected about 500,000 people, and initially there were two people missing; however, a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm.

<doc id="18499558" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18499558" title="Chromostereopsis">
Chromostereopsis

Chromostereopsis is a visual illusion whereby the impression of depth is conveyed in two-dimensional color images, usually of red-blue or red-green colors, but can also be perceived with red-grey or blue-grey images. Such illusions have been reported for over a century and have generally been attributed to some form of chromatic aberration. 
Chromatic aberration results from the differential refraction of light depending on its wavelength, causing some light rays to converge before others in the eye (longitudinal chromatic aberration or LCA) and/or to be located on non-corresponding locations of the two eyes during binocular viewing (transverse chromatic aberration or TCA). 
Chromostereopsis is usually observed using a target with red and blue bars and an achromatic background. Positive chromostereopsis is exhibited when the red bars are perceived in front of the blue and negative chromostereopsis is exhibited when the red bars are perceived behind the blue. Several models have been proposed to explain this effect which is often attributed to longitudinal and/or transverse chromatic aberrations. However, recent work attributes most of the stereoptic effect to transverse chromatic aberrations in combination with cortical factors. 
It has been proposed that chromostereopsis could have evolutionary implications in the development of eyespots in certain butterfly species. Additionally, some stained-glass artists were probably very aware of this effect, using it to generate protruding or receding, sometimes referred to as "warm" and "cold", color images.
History.
Over two centuries ago, the effect of color depth perception was first noted by Goethe in his Farbenlehre (Theory of Colours) in which he recognized blue as a receding color and yellow/red as a protruding color. He argued that, “like we see the high sky, the far away mountains, as blue, in the same way a blue field seems to recede…(also) One can stare at a perfectly yellow/red field, then the color seems to pierce into the organ”. This phenomenon, now referred to as chromostereopsis, or the stereoptic effect, explains the visual science behind this color depth effect, and has many implications for art, media, evolution, as well as our daily lives in how we perceive colors and objects.
Although Goethe did not propose any scientific reasoning behind his observations, in the late 1860s Bruecke and Donders first suggested that the chromostereoptic effect was due to accommodative awareness, given that ocular optics are not achromatic and red objects require more accommodation to be focused on the retina. This notion of accommodation could then be translated into perception of distance. However, what Donders and Bruecke originally missed in their theory is the necessity of binocular observation to produce chromostereopsis. Later, veering off from accommodative awareness, Bruecke proposed that chromatic aberration, along with the temporal off-axis effect of the pupil, can explain the chromostereoptic effect. It is this hypothesis that still forms the basis for our present day understanding of chromostereopsis.
Over the years, art analysis has provided ample evidence of the chromostereoptic effect, but until about thirty years ago little was known about the neurological, anatomical and/or physiological explanation behind the phenomena. For instance, in 1958 Dutch art historian De Wilde noted that in analyzing cubist painter Leo Gestel's painting "The Poet Rensburg", instead of using conventional graded depth cues, "If you put violet next to yellow or green next to orange, the violet and the green retreat. In general, the warm colours come forward, and the cool colours retreat". In this sense, the chromostereoptic effect gives shapes plasticity and allows for depth perception through color manipulation.
Binocular Nature of Chromostereopsis.
The binocular nature of the chromostereopsis was discovered by Bruecke and arises due to the position of the fovea relative to the optical axis. The fovea is located temporally to the optical axis and as a result, the visual axis passes through the cornea with a nasal horizontal eccentricity, meaning that the average ray bound for the fovea must undergo prismatic deviation and is thus subject to chromatic dispersion. The prismatic deviation is in opposite directions in each eye, resulting in opposite color shifts that lead to a shift in stereoptic depth between red and blue objects. The eccentric foveal receptive system, along with the Stiles-Crawford effect, work in opposite directions of one another and roughly cancel out, offering another explanation to why subjects may show color stereoscopy “against the rule” (a reversal of the expected results).
Reversal Effect.
Evidence for the stereoptic effect is often quite easy to see. For instance, when red and blue are viewed side by side on a dark surrounding, most people will view the red as "floating" in front of the blue. However, this is not true for everyone, as some people see the opposite and others no effect at all. This is the same effect that both Goethe and De Wilde had indicated in their observations. While a majority of people will view red as “floating” in front of blue, others experience a reversal of the effect in which they see blue floating in front of the red, or no depth effect at all. While this reversal may appear to discredit chromostereopsis, it does not and instead, as originally proposed by Einthoven, can be explained by an increase in the effect and subsequent reversal via blocking of the eccentric position of the pupil with respect to the optical axis. 
The diverse nature of the chromostereoptic effect is due to the fact that the color depth effect is closely intertwined with both perceptual and optical factors. In other words, neither the optical nor the perceptual factors can be taken in insolation to explain chromostereopsis. This multifactorial component of chromostereopsis offers one explanation of the reversal of the effect in different people given the same visual cues.
Another interesting reversal effect was observed in 1928 by Verhoeff in which the red bars were perceived as farther away and the blue bars as protruding when the bars are paired on a white background instead of a black background. Verhoeff proposed that this paradoxical reversal can be understood in terms of the pupil’s luminance contours (see: Illusory Contours). The pupil has lines of constant luminance efficiency, with each subsequent line marking a 25% decrease in efficiency. Around 1998, Winn and co-workers confirmed Verhoeff’s interpretation of this reversal using experiments on different colored backgrounds. Other research has also suggested that border contrast changes could lead to color depth reversal with the switch from black to white backgrounds. 
In 1933, Stiles and Crawford discovered that the light sensitivity of the fovea differs significantly for rays entering the eye through the center of the pupil versus rays entering from its peripheral regions. They observed that the usual "intensity multiplied by aperture" rule did not apply in foveal vision and that rays entering the eye via peripheral regions of the pupil were less efficient by roughly a factor of five. This effect is now known as the Stiles-Crawford effect and also has implications for the reverse chromostereoptic effect.
Theory.
In 1885, Einthoven proposed a theory which states: “The phenomenon (chromostereopsis) is due to chromatic difference of magnification, for since, for example, blue rays are refracted more than red rays by the ocular media, their foci not only lie at different levels (chromatic aberration) but make different angles with the optic axis, and will thus stimulate disparate points. It follows that individuals with temporally eccentric pupils see red in front of blue, while with nasally eccentric pupils the relief is reversed.” Einthoven first explained chromatic aberration in the eye, which means that the eyes will not focus all the colors at the same time. Depending on the wavelength, the focal point in the eyes varies. He concluded that the reason why people see red in front of blue is due to the fact that light with different wavelengths project onto different parts of the retina. When the vision is binocular, a disparity is created, which causes depth perception. Since red is focused temporally, it appears to be in front. However, under monocular vision, this phenomenon is not observed. 
However, Bruecke objected Einthoven’s theory based on the grounds that not all people see red as closer than blue. Einthoven explained that this negative chromostereopsis is probably due to eccentrically positioned pupils because shifting the pupil can change the position of where light wavelengths focus in the eye. Negative chromostereopsis was further studied by Allen and Rubin who suggested that changing the angle between the pupillary center and visual axis can change the direction of chromostereopsis. If the pupillary center is located temporal to the visual axis, red will appear closer. The reverse effect is observed when the pupillary center is nasal to the visual axis.
Stiles-Crawford Effect.
Recent research has attempted to extend the basis for the traditional chromostereoptic theory, including work done by Stiles and Crawford. In 1933, Stiles and Crawford accidentally discovered that the light sensitivity differed for rays entering through center versus those entering from peripheral regions of the eye. The efficiency of the rays is less when the rays enter via the peripheral region because the shape of the cone cells that collect the incident quanta are different than cone receptors in the center of the eye. This effect can cause both positive and negative chromostereopsis depending on the position of the pupil. If the pupil is centered on optical axis, it causes positive chromostereopsis. However, if the pupil is significantly off-center from the optical axis, negative chromostereopsis will ensue. Because most people have a point of maximum luminous efficiency that is off-center, the Stiles-Crawford Effects generally will have antagonistic chromostereoptic effects. Therefore, instead of seeing red in front of blue, blue will be seen in front of red and the effect will be reversed. The Stiles-Crawford effect also explains why positive chromostereopsis is decreased when illumination is lowered. At lower illumination, the dilation of pupil increases the pupillary peripheral region and therefore increases the magnitude of the Stiles-Crawford effect.
Chromatic Aberration.
Stereoptic depth perception obtained from two dimensional red and blue or red and green images is believed to be caused primarily by optical chromatic aberrations. Chromatic aberrations are defined as types of optical distortions that occur as a consequence of refracting properties of the eye. However, other factors, image characteristics, and perceptual factors also play a role in color depth effects under natural viewing conditions. Additionally, texture properties of the stimulus can also play a role. 
Newton first demonstrated the presence of chromatic aberration in the human eye in 1670. He observed that isolated incident light rays directed at an opaque card held close to the eye strike the refracting surfaces of the eye obliquely and are therefore strongly refracted. Because the indices of refraction (see: Refractive Index) vary inversely with wavelength, blue rays (short wavelength) will be refracted more than red rays (long wavelength). This phenomenon is called chromatic dispersion and has important implications for the optical performance of the eye, including the stereoptic effect. For instance, Newton noted that such chromatic dispersion causes the edges of a white object to be tinged with color. 
Modern accounts of chromatic aberrations divide ocular chromatic aberrations into two main categories; longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA), and transverse chromatic aberration (TCA).
Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration.
Longitudinal chromatic aberration is defined as the "variation of the eye's focusing power for different wavelengths". This chromatic difference varies from about 400nm to 700nm across the visible spectrum. In longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA), the refracting properties of the eye cause light rays of shorter wavelengths, such as blue, to converge before longer wavelength colors. 
Transverse Chromatic Aberration.
Transverse chromatic aberration is defined as the angle between the refracted chief rays for different wavelengths. Chief rays, in this case, refer to the ray of a point source that passes through the center of the pupil. Unlike LCA, TCA depends on object location in the visual field and pupil position within the eye. Object location determines the angle of incidence of the selected rays. By Snell's Law of Refraction, this incidence angle subsequently determines the amount of chromatic dispersion and thus location of the retinal images for different wavelengths of light. In transverse chromatic aberration, different wavelengths of light are displaced in non-corresponding retinal positions of each eye during binocular viewing. The interocular difference in TCA is generally attributed to the chromostereoptic effect. However, it should be noted that color induced depth effects due to TCA can only be perceived in images containing achromatic information and a single non-achromatic color. Additionally, the amplitude of the perceived depth in an image due to the stereoptic effect can be predicted from the amount of induced TCA. In other words, as the pupillary distance from the foveal achromatic axis is increased, perceived depth also increases.
Implications of Chromatic Aberrations.
Longitudinal and transverse chromatic aberrations work together to effect retinal image quality. Additionally, pupil displacement from the visual axis is critical for determining the magnitude of the aberration under natural viewing conditions. In chromostereopsis, if the pupils of the two eyes are displaced temporally from the visual axis, then blue rays from a point source will intersect the retinae on the nasal side of red rays from the same source. This induced ocular disparity makes blue rays appear to come from a more distant source than red rays.
Evolutionary Significance.
Chromostereopsis may also have evolutionary implications for predators and prey, giving it historical and practical significance. Possible evidence for the evolutionary significance of chromostereopsis is given in the fact that the fovea has developed in the lateral eyes of hunted animals to have a very large angle between the optical axis and visual axis to attain at least some binocular field of view. For these hunted animals, their eyes serve to detect predatory animals, which explains their lateral position in order to give them a full panoramic field of view. In contrast, this observed foveal development is opposite in animals of prey and in primates. Animals of prey and primates depend primarily on binocular vision, and therefore their eyes developed to be frontal in position. The angle between their optical and visual axis, therefore, can be reduced to almost negligible values, down about five degrees in man).
Butterflies may also have taken evolutionary advantage of chromostereopsis in developing distinctive "eye" patterns, which are presented on their wings. These eyespots can appear as being forward or receding in depth based on their color pattern, producing an effect of protruding or receding eyes, respectively. Natural selection may have developed these color and texture schemas because it produces the illusion of protruding or receding eyes of much larger organisms than the actual butterfly, keeping potential predators at bay. 
Yet another evolutionary example of chromostereopsis comes from cuttlefish. It has been suggested that cuttlefish estimate the distance of prey via stereopsis. Additional evidence suggests that their choice of camouflage is also sensitive to visual depth based on color-induced depth effects.
Methods of Testing.
Many different methods of testing have been employed to view the effects of chromostereopsis on depth perception in humans. Technological progress has allowed for accurate, efficient, and more conclusive testing, in relation to the past, where individuals would merely observe the occurrence. 
In one method, twenty-five control subjects were tested using color-based depth effects through the use of five different colored pairs of squares. The different colors were blue, red, green, cyan and yellow. Subjects were placed in a dark room and the colored square stimuli were presented for 400 milliseconds each, and during this time the subjects were asked to attend to either the right or left square (evenly counterbalanced across subjects). Using a joystick, the subject indicated whether the square was behind, in front of, or in the same plane as its pair. According to the theory, the longer the wavelength of the color, the closer it should be perceived by the observer for positive chromostereopsis. Having a longer wavelength than the other colors, red should appear closest. To enhance this effect, subjects put on blazed-grating ChromaDepthTM glasses, which contain a prism structure to refract the light to an angle of approximately 1° and were tested again. 
The use of electrodes to test brain activity is another, relatively new way to test for chromostereopsis. This form of testing utilizes EEG recordings of visual-evoked potentials through the use of electrodes. In one experiment, subjects were shown different stimuli in regard to color-contrast and were asked questions about its depth, as before. The electrodes attached to the subjects subsequently collected data while the experiment occurred. 
Another more routinely used technique tests the subject's extent of chromatic aberration. In one such experiment, slits placed before the subject’s eyes measured the chromatic dispersion of the eyes as a function of the separation of the slits. Prisms in front of the eyes determined the separation of the visual and null axes. The product of these separate measurements predicted the apparent depth expected with full-pupil stereoscopy. Agreement was good with expected results, supplying additional evidence that chromostereopsis depends on chromatic dispersion. 
Other experimental techniques can be used to test for reverse chromostereopsis, an occurrence seen by a minority of the population. The direction of chromostereopsis can be reversed by moving both artificial pupils in a nasal direction or temporal direction with respect to the centers of the natural pupils. Moving the artificial pupils nasally induces blue-in-front-of-red stereopsis and moving them temporally has the opposite effect. This is due to the fact that moving the pupil changes the position of the optic axis, but not the visual axis, thus changing the sign of transverse chromatic aberration. Therefore, changes in the magnitude and sign of transverse chromatic aberration brought about by changing the lateral distance between small artificial pupils are accompanied by equivalent changes in chromostereopsis 
Recent Research.
While a lot of physiological mechanisms that cause chromostereopsis have been discovered and researched, there are still unanswered questions. For instance, many researchers believe that chromostereopsis is caused by combination of multiple factors. Because of this, some of the more recent research has attempted to investigate how the different luminescence of backgrounds and different luminescence of red and blue color affect the chromostereoptic effect.
Additionally, previous studies have taken a psychophysical approach to studying chromostereopsis in order to document it as a perceptual effect and observe its optic mechanisms. However, until recently, no studies had examined the neurophysiological basis of chromostereopsis. 
The most recent neurophysiological study by Cauquil et al. describes V1 and V2 color-preferring cells as coding local image characteristics (such as binocular disparity) and surface properties of a 3D scene, respectively. The study conducted by Cauquil et al. indicates, based on electrode stimulation results, that both dorsal and ventral pathways in the brain are involved in chromostereoptic processing. This study also concluded that chromostereopsis starts in the early stages of visual cortical processing, first in the occipito-parietal region of the brain, followed by a second step in the right parietal area and temporal lobes. Additionally, activity was found to be greater in the right hemisphere, which is dominant for 3D cortical processing, indicating that chromostereopsis is a task-dependent, top-down effect. Overall, chromostereopsis involves cortical areas that underlie depth processing for both monocular and binocular cues.

The Blue Sickness

The Blue Sickness, released by Tonic records in 2000, is Bocephus King's third album. Described within the lyrics as "Goodnight forever to the two album curse", although fans will disagree that "It started out bad and it only got worse". The album is a mixed landscape of sounds that spreads out as a kind of musical soundtrack to life.
"The blue sickness is a theme I came up with. It initially started when I was trying to describe taking too much codeine. 
Then I started to think of the blue sickness as more of a mind frame for people in our age group, where you sort of don't want to go back. you don't want to go forward, it's like everyone's on this one constant nasty middle ground. The blue sickness went on to describe that whole position of sort of being stuck in the middle."
Within the liner notes of the CD there are two quotes that prepare you for the journey King has created. Before taking the trip you are warned Hustlers of the world, there is one mark you cannot beat: the mark inside." William S. Burroughs
For some, knowledge has made a godless purgatory-a savage middle ground, an incurable disease, a blue sickness." Rev. Theolopolous Jones

Easy Living (1949 film)

Easy Living is a 1949 American drama film directed by Jacques Tourneur, starring Victor Mature, Lizabeth Scott and Lucille Ball. The film features the real-life Los Angeles Rams football team.
Plot.
Star professional quarterback Pete Wilson (Victor Mature) thinks nothing of his future after football, not even after longtime teammate Bill "Holly" Holloran (Gordon Jones) is released by the team. Pete gets advance after advance on his salary from Anne (Lucille Ball), the secretary of team owner and coach Lenahan (Lloyd Nolan).
One day, however, he goes secretly to see a doctor (Jim Backus) about various symptoms he has been experiencing and learns that he has a heart condition due to a childhood bout of rheumatic fever, one that could kill him if he continues playing football. He starts to tell his wife Liza (Lizabeth Scott), but changes his mind when she is cool to Holly, whom she describes as a has-been after he is gone.
Liza is struggling to make her own interior design business a success, and drags Pete to a fancy party to try to land Gilbert Vollmer as a client. Gilbert knows she has no talent, but is interested in her for other reasons. So is his father, Howard (Art Baker). The older man is looking to replace his young girlfriend, Billy Duane, and dangles before Liza the prospect of redecorating his apartment. Knowing what he is after, Liza is willing to do whatever it takes to further her ambitions. 
Meanwhile, Pete is bitterly disappointed when his friend, retiring college head coach Virgil Ryan (Everett Glass), informs him that he cannot recommend him as his replacement because Liza is unsuitable for the duties of a coach's wife. Instead, the job is given to Pete's teammate and friend, Tim "Pappy" McCarr (Sonny Tufts). Tim offers Pete the position of his assistant, but Pete turns it down. 
Afraid of physical contact, Pete turns in a very poor performance and loses the next game. Lenahan cannot afford another loss if he wants to make the playoffs (and earn $100,000), so he benches Pete in favor of Tim. Tim plays well, and they win their next game.
When Pete proposes taking the assistant coaching position, Liza breaks up with him. However, when she gets dumped by Howard, she tries unsuccessfully to get Pete back. Pete is given another chance at glory when Tim is injured, but ultimately tells his teammates about his condition and walks away from the game. Though Anne has made it clear that she loves him, Pete decides to take Liza back, making it clear, however, that it will be on his terms.

John Wingfield

Sir John Wingfield (before 1585–1596) was an English soldier.
Life.
He was the third son of Richard Wingfield of Wantisden in Suffolk, and Mary, daughter and coheiress of John Hardwick of Derby, and the sister of Bess of Hardwick. His brother Anthony Wingfield was reader in Greek to Elizabeth I of England.
He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Lichfield in 1593.
A volunteer against the Spanish in Holland, he was appointed captain of foot in the expedition there of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in December 1585. Wounded action before Zutphen on 22 September 1586, he was knighted by Leicester. He was one of the twelve knights, friends and relations, who walked at the funeral of Sir Philip Sidney on 16 February 1587.
Returning to the Netherlands, he was appointed governor of Geertruidenberg. With the assistance furnished him by his brother-in-law, Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, he managed to hold out successfully during 1588, and to assist materially in forcing Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma to raise the siege of Bergen in November. His position, though, suffered from tension between the English auxiliaries and the States-General. The garrison lacked pay, and was mutinous. A rumour arose that he intended to hand over the place to the Spanish, and Maurice of Nassau came with a demand for its surrender. Wingfield denied the imputed treason; but Geertruidenberg was on 10 April 1589 delivered to the Spanish.
Returning to England with his wife and newly born child, Wingfield served as master of the ordnance under Sir John Norris in Brittany against the forces of the Catholic League in 1591, and the following year he is mentioned as being in charge of the storehouse at Dieppe.
In June 1596 he sailed on board the Vanguard, as camp-master with the rank of colonel, in the expedition under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex against Cadiz. After an attack on the Spanish fleet led by Walter Ralegh, in which he took part, he was one of the first to enter the town. Ordered on 21 June to bait an ambush, Wingfield led 200 men along the isthmus leading to the city gates which were defended by 500 Spanish cavalry. He then feigned a panic-stricken retreat and drew the Spanish back into the arms of a larger hidden English force. In the rout that followed the English broke through the city gates and Wingfield was wounded in the thigh, while Essex and a small band fought through to the plaza. Unable to walk, Wingfield captured a horse to follow Essex, and—now an obvious target—was killed instantly by a bullet to the head just as the city surrendered. He was buried five days later with "all the funerall solemnities of warre" in the cathedral at Cadiz, while "the generalls threw their handkerchiefs wet from their eyes into the grave" (Stow). John Donne, a member of the expedition, composed the well-known epigram ("Farther then Wingefield, no man dares to go") in tribute. In the following year the queen granted his widow an annuity of £100 a year.
Family.
Wingfield married, about 1582, Susan Bertie, countess of Kent, sister of Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, and widow of Reginald Grey, 5th Earl of Kent, by whom he had two sons, Peregrine, born in Holland, presumably named after her brother, and Robert Wingfield.

Edge of the City

Edge of the City is a 1957 American drama film directed by Martin Ritt, starring John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier. It was Ritt's debut film as a director. Robert Alan Aurthur's screenplay was expanded from his original script, staged as the final episode of "Philco Television Playhouse", "A Man Is Ten Feet Tall" (1955), also featuring Poitier.
The film was considered unusual for its time because of its portrayal of an interracial friendship, and was praised by representatives of the NAACP, Urban League, American Jewish Committee and Interfaith Council because of its portrayal of racial brotherhood.
Plot.
Young drifter Axel Nordmann (John Cassavetes) arrives at the waterfront on the west side of Manhattan, seeking employment as a longshoreman, and giving his name as "Alex North." He goes to work in a gang of stevedores headed by Charlie Malik (Jack Warden) a vicious bully, and is befriended by Tommy Tyler (Sidney Poitier), who also supervises a stevedore gang. Malik resents blacks in positions of authority, and is antagonized when Axel goes to work for Tommy.
Axel moves into Tommy's neighborhood and becomes friends with Tommy's wife Lucy (Ruby Dee) and becomes romantically involved with her friend Ellen (Kathleen Maguire). Tommy serves as a mentor to Axel, urging him to stand up to Malik, and that if he does he will be "ten feet tall." It is apparent from the start that Axel is hiding something, and it emerges that he is a deserter from the United States Army. Malik is aware of that, and is extorting money from him.
Malik frequently tries to provoke Tommy and Axel into fights, with Tommy coming to Axel's aid. Malik finally provokes Tommy into a fight, with both men using their baling hooks. Tommy at one point disarms Malik and implores him to stop, but Malik seizes the hook and kills him. The police investigation is stymied by lack of cooperation from the longshoremen, including Axel. But after meeting with the distraught Lucy, who accuses him of never being Tommy's friend, Axel finally decides to cooperate. He goes to Malik to tell him that. They get into a fight, and in the end, though beaten, Axel strangles Malik unconscious and drags him away.
Production.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer budgeted only $500,000 for the film because its racial content was believed to limit its marketability in the south. Poitier was paid $15,000 for the role and received his first co-star billing, though it was considered small by movie industry standards. Ritt, who had been blacklisted, was paid only $10,000. The film was shot on location at a railroad yard in Manhattan and on St. Nicholas Terrace in New York's Harlem.
MGM delayed release of the film because it was uneasy with the racial theme. However, the film was released after receiving rave reviews from preview audiences.
The film was not a commercial success because it did not play in the South, and was refused by many theater managers because of its depiction of an interracial relationship.
Poitier was the only actor remaining from the TV version, in which the Jack Warden character was played by Martin Balsam and the Cassavetes character was played by Don Murray. The TV version was directed by Robert Mulligan. The script was completely rewritten for the film.
The opening title sequence and theatrical release poster were designed by Saul Bass.
Reception.
Box Office.
According to MGM records the film earned $360,000 in the US and Canada and $400,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $125,000 despite its low cost.
Critical response.
The film earned positive reviews, with critics praising the unusual multiracial relationship between the Poitier and Cassavetes characters. Up till then, whites were ordinarily shown in positions of authority. "Time magazine" noted that the Poitier character "is not only the white man's boss, but is his best friend, and is at all times his superior, possessing greater intelligence, courage, understanding, warmth and general adaptability." "Variety" said the film was "a milestone in the history of screen in its presentation of an American Negro." The London "Sunday Times" said the film was "splendidly directed" by Ritt.
Cassavetes also won acclaim for his portrayal, which resembled that of Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront" (1954).
"New York Times" film critic Bosley Crowther called "Edge of the City" an "ambitious little film" that "at times close to some sort of fair articulation of the complexities of racial brotherhood." In one scene in which they have lunch at the river, "the attitudes of the young fellows—the white man with terrors in his mind and the Negro with cordial disposition to be as generous with his friendship as with food—are swiftly and trenchantly established in this little scene and the pattern of deep devotion in their subsequent comradeship is prepared." At those times, Crowther said, "Edge of the City" was a "sharp and searching film." But more often, he said, Aurthur and Ritt "have let their drama fall too patly into the pattern and the lingo of an imitative television show—a television show imitating the film "On the Waterfront.""
Cast notes.
Poitier's performance received glowing reviews, and the film, along with "Blackboard Jungle", helped establish him as "one of Hollywood's few established representatives for black Americans."
The Cassavetes character was notable for its hint of homosexuality, which was uncommon for the time. The Motion Picture Production Code Administration allowed the innuendo, but recommended "extremely careful handling to avoid planting the suspicion that he may be homosexual."
Legacy.
"Los Angeles Times" critic Dennis Lim, writing in 2009, described "Edge of the City" and "Something of Value" (1957) as "variations on an early Poitier specialty, the black-white buddy movie, the most vivid example of which is perhaps Stanley Kramer's "The Defiant Ones" (1958)," in which Poitier and Tony Curtis played escaped convicts shackled to each other.
One history of African-Americans in film, originally published by author Donald Bogle in 1973, was critical of Poitier's portrayal, referring to him as portraying a "colorless black" with "little ethnic juice in his blood." His death scene is described as being in the tradition of "the dying slave content that he has served the massa." Bogle writes that Poitier's "loyalty to the white Cassavetes destroys him just as much as the old slave's steadfastness kept him in shackles."
Music.
The score was composed, conducted and orchestrated by Leonard Rosenman.
The first release of portions of the score was on MGM Records on LP at the time of the release of the film. This recording re-issued on cd in 2003, on Film Score Monthly records.

The Bundesliga (women) 1996–97 was the 7th season of the Bundesliga (women), Germany's premier football league. It was the last season, in which the first league was divided into two divisions. Beginning with the 1997–98 season all Bundesliga teams played in a single division. As the new uniform league had eight spaces less than the divided Bundesliga, eight teams had to play in the qualification with the champions of the Regionalligas.
In the final the leaders of the northern division met. Grün-Weiß Brauweiler defeated FC Rumeln-Kaldenhausen 4–3 on penalties. Previously the regular time had ended goalless. In the extra time Rumeln-Kaldenhausen had taken an early lead, but Brauweiler had equalized late in the game. It was Brauweiler's only championship.

Christian Egenolff

Christian Egenolff or Egenolph (26 July 1502 - 9 February 1555), also known as Christian Egenolff, the Elder, was the first important printer and publisher operating from Frankfurt-am-Main, and best known for his "Kräuterbuch" and re-issue of books by Adam Ries, Erasmus von Rotterdam and Ulrich von Hutten.
Egenolff was born in Hadamar and studied humanities at the University of Mainz from 1516, but later took up the trade of bookprinting in Strasbourg, working for Wolfgang Küpfel and marrying Margarethe Karpf. He left Strasbourg in 1530 and started business as a printer/publisher and typecasting in Frankfurt-am-Main. Here he published more than 400 books over the next 25 years. His publications were often illustrated by the Nuremberg artist Hans Sebald Beham and Virgil Solis. Egenolff worked with Jacques Sabon in developing new fonts.
In October 1533 Egenolff was sued by Johann Schott, a noted Strasbourg publisher, for infringement of copyright on "Herbarium Vivae Icones", illustrated by Hans Weiditz and compiled and annotated by Otto Brunfels. Egenolff in his defense, argued that nature could not be copyrighted and that plants stood as communal models for any artist.
In 1535 he printed the German Bible and his own compilation of "Chronica". In the following years Egenolff published works by prominent authors such as Hans Sachs, Johann Eichmann aka Johann Dryander (1500–1560), Sebastian Münster, Philipp Melanchthon and Sebastian Franck.
He died in Frankfurt-am-Main and was buried in the Peterskirchhof in Frankfurt. His daughter, Magdalena Egenolff, married Adam Lonicer, one of Egenolff's employees. Lonicer became a director of the firm after Egenolff's death, publishing no fewer than four editions of the "Kräuterbuch" between 1557 and 1577. Egenolff's widow, Margarethe, carried on the business until 1572 and afterwards his children until 1602.

Groupe Nervia

Founded in 1928 at the instigation of the insurance broker Léon Eeckman and of the painters Anto-Carte and Louis Buisseret, the Groupe Nervia was a Belgian artistic circle, the purpose of which was to foster Walloon art, obscured by the Flemish Expressionism of the Laethem-Saint-Martin School, by supporting young talented artists of Hainaut. It included, in addition to Anto-Carte, eight other painters: Louis Buisseret, Frans Depooter, Léon Devos, Léon Navez, Pierre Paulus, Rodolphe Strebelle, Taf Wallet and Jean Winance.
Nervia’s art claims a Latin essence and is more realistic, lyric and intimist than their northern neighbors’. In addition to their obvious skills, Nervia’s artists refused avant-garde at all costs, deeply studied other artists, and expressed a sort of neo-humanism through themes taken from everyday and family life, treated with harmony and idealism.
Twenty exhibitions were organized between 1928 and 1938, together with other guest artists (Andrée Bosquet, Gustave Camus, Alphonse Darville, Élisabeth Ivanovsky, Geo Verbanck, Fernand Wéry and Ernest Wynants). Nervia stood out at the Salon of Ghent in 1933 and 1938 and successfully participated in the first Congrès Culturel Wallon held in Charleroi. Seven other exhibitions were organized between 1946 and 1978, including an itinerant exhibition on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Group’s creation.
Nervia was also honored by a retrospective in the Art Museum of Mons in 2002.

Isabelle Ferron

Isabelle Ferron (born 1967) is an actress in both film and stage. She is also a comedian and singer/dancer. Now she tries to write a musical with a friend, making her a complete artist.
Mini-Biography.
Isabelle Ferron was born on January 27, 1967 in Poitiers, France. When she turned seven, her mother enrolled her in the Conservatoire de Poitiers to learn the art of dancing (which she was not fond of), and eventually to learn how to play piano. With her extreme talent and loads of energy, she decided to move to Poitiers to develop her skills. In 1987 she trained with Niels Arestrup, then with Maurice Benichou in 1988. Then from 1992 to 1997 she trained with John Strasberg.
Isabelle then entered the theater stage in 1986 with her first performance in "Six Assassins Assassinés" followed by "Un Enfant Mort sur le Trottoir" in the same year (she was 19). After long years filled with experiences on stage, she moved to try the screen. She played the role of Didier's wife, Murielle in Didier Bourdon and Bernard Campan's "Le Pari" ("The Bet") in 1997 and more films. From then on, she took turns from being on screen to the stage. In 1999, she was chosen to play the very energetic Lady Capulet in Gerard Presgurvic's version of "Roméo et Juliette". She signed their contract without second thoughts, as she knew that she was about to interpret beautiful songs. She had once described her audition for the role, and said that she was first asked to sing a challenging, yet striking song, called La Haine (The Hate) and afterwards a song which she had found funny. The song was called Tu dois te marier (You Must Marry).
After more than a hundred performances as Lady Capulet,Isabelle left the cast on July 21, 2001 to continue her switches from film to stage. She was replaced by Karoline Blandin. Isabelle was still included in the music videos of the two songs, Verone and Aimer. She was also chosen to appear in some TV shows such as "Julie Lescaut". Her other stage performances include: "Y’a-t-il un Magicien dans la Salle"(Is there a magician in the room?) and "Un violon sur le toit", the French version of the classic "Fiddler on the Roof". Her solo in the aforementioned turned out to be a single as it is probably the only song with coherent lyrics. Isabelle won an award for her role as Golde in 2007 during the Marius awards. She has several plans for her career. The first one is to write a musical with her colleague, Anna Angeli. She describes that in that certain play, she would have a scene where she is alone with the monologue and the music. If not, then Isabelle dreams to earn more roles for films, stage plays and musicals, like "Roméo et Juliette". Isabelle Ferron continues to work as it is one of her strongest and deepest desires. In 2008, she was included in the Festival Diva Music (a festival of twenty different musicals). She performed in "L'ultime rendez-vous" and a solo lecture-musical called "Chienne".

Frans Depooter

Frans Depooter, born in Mons, Belgium, in 1898, was a Belgian painter. He died in 1987 in Maffe (Marche-en-Famenne, Belgian Ardennes) at age 89.
Depooter began working at age 13 in his family’s business (his father was a decorator in Mons), where he met Anto-Carte, Léon Navez, and Léon Devos. In 1928, Depooter, Anto-Carte, Navez, and Devos became co-founders of the Groupe Nervia.
In 1923, Frans Depooter married the painter Andrée Bosquet, taking painting courses at the Art Schools of Mons (E. Motte) and Brussels (Delville, Constant Montald) soon after. Recognized for his work, Depooter received several awards (among others: Gold Medal at the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs (Art Déco) in Paris in 1925, Prize of the Académie Royale de Belgique in 1969, Gold Medal of the Mérite Artistique Européen) and held the position of Director of the Molenbeek-Saint-Jean (Brussels) Art School from 1944 onwards.
A poet at heart, Frans Depooter deepened his consistently representational style in accordance with his nature. His stylized still lifes, expressionist landscapes, and portraits gave way very early to refined works of an apparent simplicity. His portraits on plain backgrounds isolate themselves in the model’s dream or inner life. His flowers compose fragile and tender bouquets. His landscapes, often treated in half tints and transposed by a shaded light, testify to a discrete sensitivity (he was called the songster of the Brabant Wallon). Frans Depooter’s talent displays a search for measure, refinement, and poetry.

Andrée Bosquet

Andrée Bosquet, born in Tournai in 1900 was a Belgian painter. She died in La Louvière in 1980. She was Frans Depooter’s wife.
Coming from cultured society, she took painting courses with M. Putsage (pastel), Anto Carte, and E.Motte, but she was primarily self-taught. She exhibited regularly from 1922 onwards, invited in particular by the Groupe Nervia and Le Bon Vouloir (Mons). She was awarded the Charles Caty Prize in 1963.
Using oil, red chalk and charcoal, Andrée Bosquet painted and drew, with simplicity and delicate elegance but without affectation, self-portraits and children’s portraits, restful and clear still lifes, and bouquets of an exquisite fragility. Her choice went towards soft and fine colors in half-tints and towards round and statuesque shapes. Her style cannot be connected with any school defined by art history, even though it might be likened to the Florentine Primitives or have common features with naïve art or Symbolism. Her works can be seen in various Belgian museums (Ghent, Brussels, Mons, La Louvière).

Govind Pant Bundele

Govind Ballal Kher (1710 ? - 1761), historically known as ‘Govind Pant Bundele’, was a Military General of Peshwas in Northern India during 1733 to 1761. Peshwa Bajirao appointed him his trustee for the 1/3 kingdom rewarded to him by Maharaja Chhatrasal in Bundelkhand. He was the founder of the city of Sagar situated in the Central India.
Early life.
Govind Pant was born in a Karhade Brahmin family in village ‘Nevare’ in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra in or around 1710. His father was Kulkarni of the village and Govind Pant inherited this post on early death of his father. Being a vagabond, however, he was forced to leave the post and also his native place and was compelled to wander in the search of a job.
Career.
In the beginning, he worked under the then rising Maratha Generals Malharrao Holkar and Antaji Mankeshwar and got good experience of guerilla war and administration.
On recommendation by Antaji, Bajirao Peshwa assigned some jobs to Govind Pant and found him extremely useful. Soon he became Bajirao’s one of the most favorite.
When Bajirao got Bundelkhand from Maharaja Chhatrasal in 1733, he appointed Govindpant as his Administrator and Power of attorney for this newly annexed land.
In 1735-1736 with Peshwa’s permission, he built a new town called ‘Sagar’ and made it his Capital.
He was always known to be the greatest ‘Fund raiser’ of the Maratha Empire.
Contribution to the Battle of Panipat.
Govind Pant did his best to help the Maratha army under the leadership of Sadashivrao Bhau during Battle of Panipat in 1761. He himself had trapped Ahmed Shah Abdali in the region between Ganges and Yamuna (termed as "Duab") and had made him totally helpless.But when he got the opportunity he delivered a considerable amount at Delhi to Naro Shankar and started attacking the supplies of Ahmad Shah Abdali. Unfortunately however, a sheer misunderstanding led him to lose his life in an unexpected tussle with the troops under Abdali’s General Ataikhan.
Controversy.
Veteran historian V K Rajwade holds Govind Pant responsible for the defeat of Marathas in the battle of Panipat (1761). Also he does not consider him as a man of importance. Moreover, he accuses him to be always corrupt. These allegations have however been refuted stating that the first two statements by Rajwade are contradictory to each other. Govind Pant can be held responsible only if he was a man of importance. Secondly, Marathas were on the verge of victory even after substantial time had passed for Govind Pant’s death. There were so many other reasons for the defeat including wrong decisions by Sadashivrao Bhau, untimely retreat by Malharrao Holkar and death of Peshwa Vishwas Rao. Thirdly, accusing Govind Pant of corruption would mean underestimating the capabilities of Peshwa Bajirao and Nanasaheb as Govind Pant was their Power of Attorney continuously for more than 25 years.

Kan-Cheong Kitchen

Kan-Cheong Kitchen is the title of a culinary-themed game show produced and broadcast by 8TV in Malaysia. "Kan-cheong" () is Cantonese for "nervous", which describes the tense, hustled atmosphere which arises from contestants deficient of cooking skills who had to cook on their own in a limited time, subjecting themselves to yelling.
Format.
In each episode, two pairs, each consisting of a "cook" and a "cannot cook" (i.e. one possesses the skills while the other does not, at least for the featured meal), competing against each other in a cooking showdown. Only the "cannot cooks" will enter the kitchen and perform the cooking while the "cooks" yell instructions to their partners. To make matters harder, the "cooks" are kept fairly distant from the "cannot cooks" in a booth equipped with monitor to observe the his/her partner's performance – a camera is attached on each "cannot cook's" forehead.

Northern Territory general election, 2008

General elections were held in the Northern Territory of Australia on 9 August 2008. Of the 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly, 23 were contested; two safe Labor seats were uncontested. The incumbent centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), led by Chief Minister Paul Henderson won a narrow third term victory against the opposition centre-right Country Liberal Party (CLP), led by Terry Mills. Labor suffered a massive and unexpected swing against it, to hold a one seat majority in the new parliament.
Results.
Independents: Gerry Wood
Two safe seats were won by the ALP by default as no CLP or other candidate was fielded and therefore do not contribute to votes in the above result table. The Greens ran in six of the 25 seats, averaging around 16 percent. Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage, Minister for Parks and Wildlife Len Kiely was defeated as was Minister for Sport and Recreation, Corporate and Information Services Matthew Bonson.
Background.
The first territory election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974 saw the CLP led by Goff Letts win 17 of 19 seats on 49 per cent of the vote, while the ALP did not win a seat, on 30 per cent. The CLP retained government under various leaders at each election until 2001, when the ALP led by Clare Martin unexpectedly won government, with 13 of 25 seats. The Martin-led ALP retained government in 2005 on 19 of 25 seats, leaving the CLP with four, the largest result since 1974. Clare Martin resigned as Chief Minister on 26 November 2007, along with her Deputy Syd Stirling. Paul Henderson the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training took over as Chief Minister with Marion Scrymgour as Deputy, who was the highest ranking indigenous politician in Australia.

Mosquito Squadron

Mosquito Squadron is a 1969 British war film made by Oakmont Productions, directed by Boris Sagal and starring David McCallum, with a memorable music score (starting with 29 pounding bass drum beats to background the V-1 flying-bomb theme of the film), which was composed and conducted by Frank Cordell.
Plot.
Second World War and the Royal Air Force attacks German V-1 flying bomb installations during the early summer of 1944. The de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bomber aircraft of Squadron Leader David "Scotty" Scott (David Buck) is shot down during a low-level bombing raid on a V-1 launching site, and Scott and his navigator/bomb-aimer are reportedly killed. His wingman and friend, then-Flight Lieutenant (later insignia Royal Canadian Air Force squadron leader) Quint Munroe (David McCallum) comforts Scott's wife Beth (Suzanne Neve) and a romance soon develops, rekindling one that they had had years earlier. 
After nearly losing his own life on a photographic reconnaissance mission over the Chateau de Charlon in Northern France, Munroe, under orders from a somewhat exuberant Air Commodore Hufford (Charles Gray), leads a Barnes Wallis-type land-use "bouncing bomb" (referred to as "Highball") attack against the chateau. There, following the reported capture by the Gestapo of a French Maquis resistance fighter who supposedly talked under torture, Allied prisoners, including a very-much-alive Scott and men from their group, are held as "human shields." This is seen in a disturbing film dropped by a Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter that had, in tandem with one other, raided the base several days earlier, strafing the airfield and killing many personnel.
The Royal Air Force target is an underground tunnel in the grounds of the chateau where new weapons based on the V-1 are being constructed. In a coordinated raid, the prisoners are held in the chapel during Sunday morning mass in order to concentrate them in one place, thus allowing French Maquis resistance fighters to get them out once a Mosquito has used one of the "Highballs" to blow a hole in the outer wall close to the chapel, only not before Father Belaguere (Michael Anthony), a Catholic priest and Maquis agent, is killed by an enraged German army officer, Lieutenant Schack (Vladek Sheybal), for refusing to order the RAF men to go back to their cells. The senior RAF officer amongst the captives, Squadron Leader Neale (Bryan Marshall) is killed by German machine-pistol fire during the breakout as fellow comrades make their way with the help of the resistance fighters out of the chateau grounds while the bombing raid continues with a second wave of Mosquito bombers dropping conventional bombs with the intention of completely destroying the building.
Munroe and Scott are briefly reunited after the former's aircraft is brought down by flak, though Scott, still suffering from amnesia and unable to remember even his own name (hence, he sports a chalked "X" on his uniform), rebuffs Munroe's attempt to get him to remember who he is, ignoring mention of even his wife's name. Scott then sacrifices himself while stopping a German tank, saving Munroe and others, but too late to save Munroe's navigator, Flight Sergeant Wiley Bunce (Nicky Henson). 
The next day, after rescue by a submarine, Munroe, along with survivors from the raid, is repatriated and comes back to the base in one of two Avro Anson transport aircraft. There, after being congratulated by his commanding officer, Wing Commander Penrose (Dinsdale Landen), as well as Air Commodore Hufford, he is reunited, albeit separately, with Beth and her brother Flight Lieutenant Douglas Shelton (David Dundas), an ex-pilot who had lost his right hand on operations (he sports a hook in its place) but now serving with the same squadron and in charge of training. However, he deliberately still conceals the secret from her that her now-dead husband had survived the crash that he had witnessed, although, thanks to the German film, both he and Shelton had, in fact, known for some time that he had not been killed as first generally believed.
Production.
Although not a sequel, the film is similar to the 1964 film "633 Squadron" and is influenced by it, even using footage from the earlier film. The pre-title sequence of the film (including the aforementioned opening music by Frank Cordell) was also taken from an earlier film called "Operation Crossbow." Bovingdon Airfield in Hertfordshire was a location for many scenes in the film; four "flightworthy" de Havilland Mosquito aircraft, including "RR299", which eventually crashed and was destroyed in July 1996, were based at the airfield. The "chateau" used in the film is actually Minley Manor, the officers' mess of Gibraltar Barracks, near Farnborough in Hampshire, Southern England. The raid echoes Operation Jericho, a co-ordinated RAF/Maquis raid which freed French prisoners from Amiens jail in which the Mosquito took part.
The Highball weapon featured in the film was an actual development of Barnes Wallis's "dam-busting" Upkeep bomb, and the footage seen in the film of Mosquitoes dropping Highballs on land is genuine archive film. Charles Gray's character mentions Barnes Wallis during his briefing, in such a way as to imply that the name was well-known to the RAF men. The special Highball bombsight seen in the film is also a genuine representation of the sight used for dropping Highball.
Reception.
Most reviewers concentrated on the low-budget production values, but the script and cast have also come in for some severe criticism in some quarters.

1983–84 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1983–84 campaign was Town's first season in the second tier since their dreadful campaign in the 1972–73 season under the management of Ian Greaves. They had a very good first season, finishing a respectable 12th place, although without the mid-season slump, Town might have finished nearer the promotion places.
Review.
Following their impressive promotion campaign the previous season, many Town fans were hoping that Town would return to the promised land of the First Division and Town had a fairly good start to the season, with the exception of losing their 34 match unbeaten home record, which went back to the end of the 1981–82 season, when they lost 3–2 to Chelsea in September.
Following Christmas, Town suffered a dramatic lost in form, going on a run of 9 matches without a win, which seemed to put Town in a downward spiral right back to the Third Division. So Mick Buxton decided to bring in some more strikers on loan to help Town in their time of need.
Peter Eastoe (on loan from West Bromwich Albion) and Mel Eves (on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers) helped bring up a mini-revival which eventually got Town clear of the relegation mess and finished in a respectable 12th place with 57 points, the same amount of points as Fulham and Charlton Athletic.

Heinz Nowarra

Heinz Nowarra (born 1897 – died 1945?) was a German chess master.
He tied for 4-6th in Berlin City Chess Championship in 1938 (Kurt Richter won), shared 1st with Berthold Koch and Paul Mross at Berlin 1938 (GER-ch qual), tied for 15-16th at Bad Oeynhausen 1938 (the 5th GER-ch, Erich Eliskases won), tied for 9-10th at Berlin 1939 (Franz Mölbitz won), and took 10th at Berlin 1940 (Efim Bogoljubow won), 
During World War II, he played in several tournaments in General Government (occupied central Poland). He took 5th in 1941 (dr Walcker won) and 2nd, behind Mross, in 1942 in Kraków City championships, tied for 10-12th at Kraków/Warsaw 1941 (the 2nd General Government-ch, Alexander Alekhine and Paul Felix Schmidt won), tied for 7-8th at Krynica 1943 (the 4th GG-ch, Josef Lokvenc won), took 7th at Radom 1944 (the 5th GG-ch, Bogoljubow won), and took 5th in Kraków in May 1944 (Rudolf Teschner won).
Nowarra took also part in correspondence chess tournaments. In December 1944, his game against Klaus Junge had to be interrupted as a draw, when Junge left for the front. As Luděk Pachman wrote, Nowarra shared probably the fate of his opponent, who died in the final days of World War II. Until today, there are no news about what occurred to Nowarra.

Dechen Cave

The Dechen Cave () at Iserlohn in Germany is one of the most beautiful and most visited show caves in Germany. It is located in the northern part of the Sauerland at Iserlohn (Grüne district). 360 metres of the 870-metre long cave have been laid out for visitors, beginning at the spot where, in 1868, the cave was discovered by two railway workers. The workers dropped a hammer into a rock crevice which turned out to be the entrance to a dripstone cave when they were searching for the lost tool.
The cave is named after "Oberberghauptmann" Heinrich von Dechen (1800–1889), in recognition of his contribution to researching the geology of the Rhineland and Westphalia.

Amateur Station Operator's Certificate

Amateur Station Operator's Certificate or ASOC is the examination that needs to be passed to receive an amateur radio licence in India. The exam is conducted by the Wireless and Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC) of the Ministry of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. The examination is held in various cities in India on monthly or quarterly basis depending on the size of the city. The licence may be awarded to an individual or a club station operated by a group of licensed amateur radio operators. 
The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921 during the British rule. Partly due to low awareness among the general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators remained low for several decades. In 1970, there were less than a thousand operators; by 1980, the number had risen to 1,500. In 2000, there were 10,000 operators and as of 2007, there are more than 17,000 licensed users in India.
History.
[[Image:VU2ZD1.jpg|thumb|QSL card of a fictitious amateur radio operator. 
VU is the call-sign prefix for Indian Amateur Radio Operators. The middle number signifying the Examination Category passed.]]
Examination and syllabus.
The exam consists of two parts:
The maximum number of marks that a candidate can secure is 100. To pass the examination, a candidate must score a minimum of 40 (50 for Grade I) in each written section, and 50 (55 for Grade I) in aggregate for a pass.
Radio theory and practice.
The Radio theory and practice syllabus includes eight subtopics:
The first subtopic is the elementary theory of electricity that covers topics on conductors, resistors, Ohm's Law, power, energy, electromagnets, inductance, capacitance, types of capacitors and inductors, series and parallel connections for radio circuits. The second topic is the elementary theory of alternating currents. Portions include sinusoidal alternating quantities such as peak values, instantaneous values, RMS average values, phase; electrical resonance, and quality factor for radio circuits. The syllabus then moves on to semiconductors, specifically the construction and operation of valves, also known as vacuum tubes. Included in this portion of the syllabus are thermionic emissions with their characteristic curves, diodes, triodes and multi-electrode valves; and the use of valves as rectifiers, oscillators, amplifiers, detectors and frequency changers, stabilisation and smoothing.
Radio receivers is the fourth topic that covers the principles and operation of TRF receivers and Superheterodyne receivers, CW reception; with receiver characteristics such as sensitivity, selectivity and fidelity; Adjacent-channel interference and image interference; AGC and squelch; and signal to noise ratio (S/R). Similarly, the next topic on transmitters covers the principles and operation of low power transmitters; oscillators such as the Colpitts oscillator, Hartley oscillator, crystal oscillators, and stability of oscillators.
The last three topics deal with radio propagation, aerials, and frequency measurement. Covered are topic such as wavelength, frequency, nature and propagation of radio waves; ground and sky waves; skip distance; and fading. Common types of transmitting and receiving aerials such as Yagi antennas, and radiation patterns, measurement of frequency and use of simple frequency meters conclude the topic.
Regulations.
Knowledge of the Indian Wireless Telegraph Rules and the Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Service) Rules are essential and always tested. The syllabus also includes international radio regulations related to the operation of amateur stations with emphasis on provisions of radio regulation nomenclature of the frequency and wavelength, frequency allocation to amateur radio service, measures to prevent harmful interference, standard frequency and time signals services across the world, identification of stations, distress and urgency transmissions, amateur stations, phonetic alphabets, and figure code are the other topics included in the portion.
Also included in the syllabus are Q codes such as QRA, QRG, QRH, QRI, QRK, QRL, QRM, QRN, QRQ, QRS, QRT, QRU, QRV, QRW, QRX, QRZ, QSA, QSB, QSL, QSO, QSU, QSV, QSW, QSX, QSY, QSZ, QTC, QTH, QTR, and QUM; and CW abbreviations and prosigns such as AA, AB, AR, AS, C, CFM, CL, CQ, DE, K, NIL, OK, R, TU, VA, WA, and WB.
Morse.
The syllabus includes the following Morse code characters: all alphabets, numbers, prosigns, and punctuations such as the full-stop; comma; semi-colon; break sign; hyphen and question mark.
Receiving: For Grade II, the test piece consists of a passage of 125 letters, five letters counting as one word. Candidates are required to copy for five minutes at the speed of five words per minute, international Morse signals from an audio oscillator keyed either manually or automatically. A short practice piece is sent at the prescribed speed before the start of the test. More than five errors disqualifies a candidate. For Grade I, the test piece consists of a passage of 300 characters: letters, figures, and punctuations. The average words contain five characters and each figure and punctuation is counted as two characters. Candidates have to receive for five consecutive minutes at a speed of 12 words per minute.
Sending: For Grade II, the test piece consists of 125 letters, with five letters forming one word. Candidates are required to transmit by using a Morse key for five consecutive minutes at the minimum speed of five words per minute. A short practice piece is allowed before the test. Candidates are not allowed more than one attempt in the test. More than five uncorrected errors disqualifies a candidate. For Grade I, the speed sent is 12 words per minute.

String Quartet No. 2 (Smetana)

Bedřich Smetana's String Quartet No. 2 in D minor is a chamber composition for string quartet. It's Smetana's last quartet.
Background.
In June 1882, after composing the monumental cycle Má vlast, operas Tajemství, Čertova stěna and other works, Smetana began thinking about the creation of his second string quartet. A month later he finished the first movement. In a letter to his friend Josef Srba the deaf and dejected composer presents the difficulties with the work, his misgivings and fears. He continued very slowly, and the whole composition wasn't finished until 12 March 1883. (Several minor changes were made after the work was completed). Smetana attended the first non-public performance in Spring (April?) 1883. The first public performance took place on 3 January 1884, at the "Konvikt Hall" in Prague. The work was played by Ferdinand Lachner, Julius Raušer, Josef Krehan and Alois Neruda. 
The quartet was published posthumously, in 1889.
Structure.
The composition consists of four movements:
Smetana said, that the second quartet takes up from where the first finished: ""...after the catastrophe, it represents the turbulence of music in a person who had lost his hearing"". The musical construction and language are entirely new, unusual. The composition was at first received by the part of listeners and critics with hesitation, and even with objections. However, thanks to many successful interpretations (Czech Quartet, Smetana Quartet, Janáček Quartet etc.) the quartet today belongs to the great values of Czech music history and culture.

Lapo Mosca

Lapo Mosca is the fictional main character of a series of detective novels written by Hélène Nolthenius, a Dutch novelist and historian. Professionally, Nolthenius specialized in the history of Italian music during the renaissance, and her character Lapo Mosca was a travelling musician before he became a Franciscan monk. Even as a monk, Lapo continues to entertain the crowd with his popular poetry and songs. Many translations of actual Italian poetry and songs of the 14th century are included in the novels. Lapo himself carries the nickname "Mosca", fly, for his restlessness, but is also called "Lapo Duedonne" in reference to his most famous song. The historical figures mentioned in the novels include a number of 14th century travelling musicians, such as Angelo Moronti. 
Background.
Scant detail is given about the previous life of Lapo Mosca. He was born in Lucca, and although from a poor family received some education in a local school. As an adult he became a travelling musician, apparently achieving his greatest popularity in Tuscany but travelling at least as far as Avignon. Many of his songs were protest songs, but on a bad day in Verona he was arrested for incitement to rebellion: Two men who had put heeded his rebellious advice were hanged, while Lapo himself was only branded, because the local ruler had been amused by his songs. He stopped singing protest songs and year later he joined the Franciscan order, seeking a way to show his solidarity with the poor in a less dangerous manner. He finally settled down in a monastery in Fiesole, which suits him, being a simple and poor institution. It is led by a "guardiano", not named, who Lapo respects for his intelligence and wisdom, even if he may find some of his fellow monks lacking in these qualities. Lapo Mosca is greatly attached to Florence, the capital of Tuscany.
Lapo Mosca as detective.
It is not clear from the novels how Lapo Mosca acquired his reputation as a skilled detective, but his superiors in the church are eager to employ him on difficult missions. In the first novel, No leg to stand on (a Dutch expression meaning as much as "to lack reasonable arguments"), the services of Lapo Mosca are lent to a monastery of the Dominican order in exchange for a relic. In the second, When wolf eats wolf, bishop Orsini sends him to investigate rumours about ghosts and witchcraft in the mountain village of Vertine. In the third, Babylon on the Rhone, Lapo Mosca is sent to Avignon to look after the business interests of his order. 
Lapo Mosca relies on his extensive contacts and peasant common sense rather than any scientific method. He walks through he hills of Tuscany, uses his state as a monk and his skills as a musician to gain entry, and interrogates people. He is easily diverted, acquiring subsidiary missions along the way, and follows numerous false tracks. The truth is revealed at the last moment and often by coincidence. 
The tone of the novels is often deeply ironic and the plot tends to reflect this. One of the murder victims in "When wolf eats wolf" is Benedetto Strozzi, an extremely hard and cruel man, through strictly honest. Throughout a long investigation Lapo Mosca assumes that Strozzi has been murdered out of revenge by a relative of one of his own numerous victims, but finally he discovers that Strozzi became the victim of his honesty, and was murdered at the instigation one of his own relatives because he threatened to expose a fraud. Nevertheless Lapo himself decides to promulgate the story that Strozzi was murdered out of revenge by Angelo Moronti, a story which he knows to be untrue, but actually is of some benefit to Moronti's relatives. Such plot twists are typical for the Lapo Mosca novels.
Context.
According to her biography, Nolthenius was rather a loner who did not belong to any literary or scientific circle. She is better known for her non-fiction work, the most important of which is a study of the history of Gregorian music. 
In 1975 she did publish a first detective novel that was clearly inspired by Agatha Christie. The first Lapo Mosca novel was published in 1978, a few years before "The Name of the Rose" in 1980 by Umberto Eco, the third and last one in 1991. Both authors chose to have a Franciscan monk as detective and protagonist in a 14th-century Italian setting, and made extensive reference to the historical context. While William of Baskerville is a very intellectual Englishman, Lapo Mosca is an Italian and a simple peasant, but both share the same barbed and somewhat ironic relationship with authorities and wealthy religious orders. References to radical Franciscans, heresy, the papacy in Avignon, and Roger Bacon, can be found in the works of both authors, making it at least plausible that they influenced each other. However, in other respects the two literary worlds are very different, a major distinction being that Nolthenius greatly respected historical accuracy, while Eco deliberately weaved numerous anachronisms into his book.

Easton Ski Area

Easton Ski Area, part of the Eaglebrook School, is a small, private alpine ski area located on the western slope of the Pocumtuck Range in Deerfield, Massachusetts.
Eaglebrook School's skiing history dates back to 1923. For many decades, various areas were used around the campus, including a rope tow served slope located near the northern portion of the present day ski area.
In the 1970s, a T-Bar lift was built from the bottom of the ski jumps to the top of the ridge, serving intermediate and expert terrain. A mid station was available for those using the lower mountain's beginner terrain. Years later, snowmaking and machine grooming were added.
In the mid 1990s, a novice trail was blasted just above the dormitories, providing the first top to bottom beginner terrain at the ski area.
Around the start of the 20th century, the T-Bar was removed and a slightly longer Doppelmayr double chairlift, purchased from Wachusett Mountain Ski Area, was installed.
Snowmaking.
Most of the trails at Easton Ski Area are covered with snowmaking. The snowmaking fleet includes many fan guns.

Jangchang

The Jangchang, literally "long spear", is a Korean weapon first described in the martial manual Muyejebo from the 16th century. The weapon was preferably made from the yew tree, but other wood could be used as well, like wood from the oaktree and chestnut.
The length of the spear was about four meters. Because of its length the weapon wasn't used to throw with.
Techniques.
In the Muyedobotongji two forms are described to practice with the "jangchang". The first one being "jangchang jun chong bo" (장창전총보, 長槍前總譜) and the second one being "jangchang hubo" (장창후보, 長槍後譜). The forward moving form and the backward moving form respectively. The way of the movements is also given in diagrams called "jangchang jun chong do" and "jangchang hudo", where the word "do" (도, 圖) means 'drawing' and stands for 'diagram'.
Spears were used by the infantry as well as the cavalry.

Alaska gubernatorial election, 2002

The 2002 Alaska gubernatorial election took place on 5 November 2002 for the post of Governor of Alaska. Republican US Senator Frank Murkowski defeated Democratic Lieutenant Governor Fran Ulmer. Murkowski became the first Republican elected governor of Alaska since Jay Hammond in 1978.
Primaries.
Incumbent Democratic Governor Tony Knowles was term limited from running again. Lieutenant Governor Fran Ulmer easily won the Democratic primary on 27 August against outsiders Michael Beasley and Bruce Lemke, neither of whom did much campaigning. Meanwhile Senator Frank Murkowski also gained an easy win in the Republican primary.
Campaign.
Murkowski started the campaign as the clear favourite as Ulmer, despite being Lieutenant Governor, had a lot less name recognition. Polls initially showed Ulmer about 20 percent behind Murkowski but as the campaign continued Ulmer closed on Murkowski in the polls by concentrating on local issues such as the state budget and by portraying herself as a moderate. By October polls showed the candidates about level with one poll on the 17 October showing Ulmer on 46% and Murkowski on 43%.
The biggest issue in the campaign was the economy and what to do about the projected budget shortfall in Alaska. The issue dominated the October debates between the two candidates in Fairbanks and Anchorage. Ulmer argued that the state should consider introducing a statewide tax for the first time since 1980 if the budget reserve fell too far and that state spending should be capped. However Murkowski opposed any new taxes and called his opponent pro-tax. He said that new oil prospects, high oil prices and revenues from other resources could close the gap in the budget.
President George Bush made an advertisement to support Murkowski, who also received support from Republicans Gale Norton, Ted Stevens and Don Young. Ulmer received support from former Republican Governor Jay Hammond, Governor Tony Knowles and called on voters to support her so that Murkowski could stay working as Senator for Alaska in Congress. During the campaign Murkowski refused to say who he would appoint to serve his remaining two years as Senator but after the election appointed his daughter Lisa Murkowski, majority leader in the Alaska House of Representatives, to the US Senate.
Election results.
U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski won the election with 55.85% of the vote, the highest percentage for any Alaska gubernatorial candidate up to that time.

Reinhard Freiherr von Werneck (28 June 1757 – 27 July 1842) was the successor of Benjamin Thompson in the management of the English Garden in Munich. During the six years that he held this office he was responsible for the creation of the Kleinhesseloher See and the addition of the Hirschau to the garden.
Life.
He was born in Ludwigsburg, the son of Franz Friedrich Freiherr von Werneck and his wife Marianne Dorothea, born von Mentzingen. He served briefly in the Austrian army, then turned to farming, before joining the Bavarian army as a colonel ("Oberst") in the infantry in 1797. In November 1798, he was given the direction of the English Garden "to fill out his free hours" ("zur Ausfüllung seiner Mußestunden"); and this responsibility was made his main duty in March 1799, with the guidance of Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who had general responsibility for garden construction in Bavaria and Rheinland Pfalz. At his own cost Werneck travelled to Bohemia and Saxony to prepare himself for his duties. He hoped to make the English Garden self-supporting or even profitable by means of farming and mills (a sawmill and a grainmill were built in 1798), almost doubling the area of the garden for the purpose, through the addition of a stretch of ground to the north of the original garden. improvement of the garden was not inspired by business considerations: around 1800 a new lake was created at the northern end of the original garden, the Kleinhesseloher See. Kleinhesselohe, after which it was named, was a small collection of buildings at the original northern entrance to the park, where beer, milk and cold food was served. Werneck's lake was smaller than the modern one; his successor Sckell increased its area considerably in 1812
The newly acquired ground, the Hirschau, was of low agricultural quality; and Werneck set his soldiers to improving it in 1800 to 1802. These improvements had been expensive; and when Werneck sought money to cover the debts incurred and to buy more livestock for the garden, the request was refused. In order to finance the garden, he was driven to himself buy the concession to the mills, when no other buyer could be found at the price demanded of 5000 florins. In addition, he had made an enemy of Professor Anton Will, director of the veterinary school, which Thompson had created along with the English Garden. Insulting language from Werneck – as, for instance, that he shat on Will's demands – led Will to complain at court. In 1804 Maximilian IV Joseph gave Sckell direct charge of the English Garden and removed Werneck, with assurances of "complete satisfaction" ("allerhöchster Zufriedenheit") with his work. Werneck was disappointed: "I am losing the English Garden, working on which made my life agreeable; I had sought nothing, asked for nothing, and I lose the only thing that gave me pleasure."
As consolation, he was promoted to major general ("Generalmajor") and given charge of the corps of cadets, in which children destined to become officers were instructed. He held this post until his retirement on account of ill health in 1817. In 1818 he settled in Schloss Triesdorf in Ansbach. He survived for many years and was still living in 1838, when Ludwig I honoured his contributions to the English Garden with a monument, designed by Leo von Klenze near the banks of the Kleinhesseloher See. He died on July 27, 1842 at the age of 85 in Tegernsee.

Nangseon

The nangseon (Chinese: langxian, also called "nangseonchang" in Korean) was a branched spear with many thorns attached to the branches. It is also called 'multi tip spear'. The blades could be dipped in poison. The "nangseon" was a perfect weapon for defense. It would be difficult for the opponent to get near the person holding the nangseon without getting touched by the thorns. The "nangseon" is already being mentioned in the 16th century martial arts manual Muyejebo.
The weapon was probably an invention of the Chinese general Qi Jiguang (戚继光) of the Ming Dynasty who describes it in his manual titled Ji Xiao Xin Shu which served as an example to the Muyejebo. The nangseon acted as the backup up of the shield (deungpae) bearers in a "Mandarin duck formation".

Dispersion staining

The optical properties of all liquid and solid materials change as a function of the wavelength of light used to measure them. This change as a function of wavelength is called the dispersion of the optical properties. The graph created by plotting the optical property of interest by the wavelength at which it is measured is called a dispersion curve.
The dispersion staining is an analytical technique used in light microscopy that takes advantage of the differences in the dispersion curve of the refractive index of an unknown material relative to a standard material with a known dispersion curve to identify or characterize that unknown material. These differences become manifest as a color when the two dispersion curves intersect for some visible wavelength. This is an optical staining technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce the color. Its primary use today is in the conformation of the presence of asbestos in construction materials but it has many other applications.
Types.
There are five basic optical configurations of the microscope used for dispersion staining. Each configuration has its advantages and disadvantages. The first two of these, Becke` line dispersion staining and oblique dispersion staining, were first reported in the United States by F. E. Wright in 1911 based on work done by O. Maschke in Germany during the 1870s. The five dispersion staining configurations are:
All of these configurations have the same requirements for the preparation of the sample to be examined. First, the substance of interest must be in intimate contact with the known reference material. In other words, the clean solid must be mounted in a reference liquid, one mineral phase must be in intimate contact with the reference mineral phase, or the homogenous liquid must contain the reference solid. Most applications involve a solid mounted in a reference liquid. Second, dispersion colors will only be present if the two materials have the same refractive index for some wavelength in the visible spectrum (referred to as λo) and they have very different dispersions curves for the refractive index. Finally, the sample must be properly mounted under a coverslip to minimize any other optical effect that could complicate the interpretation of the color seen. Once these criteria are met the sample is ready to be examined.
The starting configuration of the microscope for all of these methods is properly adjusted Köhler illumination. Some additional adjustments are required for each of the methods.
Becke' line dispersion staining.
The Becke' Line method takes advantage of the fact that particles behave basically like lens because they tend to be thinner at the edges than they are at the center. If the particle has a higher refractive index than the liquid surrounding it then it behaves as a convex lens and focuses a parallel beam of light on the side opposite the source of the light. Looking through the microscope this is seen as a bright ring of light, the Becke` Line, moving in from the edge as the particle is dropped out of focus by increasing the distance between the stage of the microscope and the objective. If the stage is moved closer to the objective then the particle behaves like a magnifying glass and the image of the Becke` Line is magnified and it appears outside the particle.
A requirement for this method is that the incoming beam of light is as parallel as possible. This requires the closing down of the sub-stage condenser iris. Closing the sub-stage condenser iris decreases the resolution of the particle and increases the depth of field over which other objects may interfere with the effect seen. For large particles this is not a significant limitation but for small particles it is a problem.
When the conditions for dispersion staining are met (the particle is mounted in a liquid with a matching refractive index in the visible range of wavelengths but with a very different refractive index) then the particle has a high refractive index in the red part of the spectrum and a lower refractive index in the blue. This is because liquids tend to have a steeper dispersion curve than colorless solids. As a result, when the particle is dropped out of focus the red wavelengths are focused inward. For the blue wavelengths the particle behaves like a concave lens and the blue Becke` Line moves out into the liquid.
The color of these two bands of light will vary depending on where the particle and liquid match in refractive index, the location of λo. If the match is near the blue end of the spectrum then the Becke' Line moving into the particle will contain nearly all of the visible wavelengths except blue and will appear as a pale yellow. The Becke` Line moving out will appear a very dark blue. If the match is near the red end of the spectrum then the Becke` Line moving into the particle will appear dark red and the Becke` Line moving out will appear pale blue. If the λo is near the middle of the visible wavelengths then the Becke` Line moving into the particle will be orange and the Becke` Line moving out will be sky blue. The colors seen (see Chart 1) can be used to very precisely determine the refractive index of the unknown or confirm the identity of the unknown, as in the case of asbestos identification. Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at http://microlabgallery.com/gallery-dsbecke.aspx. The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.
The Becke' Line method of dispersion staining is primarily used as an exploratory technique. As a particle field is scanned and the fine focus is constantly adjusted and flash of color around or in a particle is noted and one of the other methods can be used to sharpen the sensitivity in determining the matching wavelength. For large particles (greater than 25 micrometers in diameter) the colored Becke` Lines may be sufficiently distinct to determine the lo with the required accuracy. For very large particles (greater than 100 micrometers) this may be the best method because it is least sensitive to other types of optical interferences.
Oblique illumination dispersion staining.
Oblique illumination dispersion staining is the result of refraction and the convex shape of most particles. With oblique illumination the beam of light illuminating the sample is directed at an oblique angle through the sample. This enhances the resolution of structural details in the particle that are oriented at right angles to the incident beam of light while sacrificing some of the resolution of features parallel to the direction of the beam. Because of this orientation of the beam the relative refractive index of the particle and the mounting liquid becomes apparent. The wavelengths for which the liquid has the higher refractive index are refracted into the front lens of the objective from the side of the particle nearest the side from which the light is coming. If the particle has a higher refractive index for all visible wavelengths then this side of the particle is dark. The side farthest from the source of the light shows all the wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. These effects are seen with the particle in sharp focus. This is a significant advantage over the Becke` line method because the particle doesn’t have to be defocus to see the colors and generally the colors are more distinct than are the Becke` line dispersion colors. The colors seen with this type of dispersion staining are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1. Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at microlabgallery.com site for Becke` Line Dispersion Staining. The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.
Darkfield illumination dispersion staining.
Darkfield illumination dispersion staining is the result of the image of the particle being formed only by the light that is refracted while all the direct light impinging on the specimen is oriented at such an angle that it misses the front lens of the objective. 
The result is that the background is black. All of the features of objects in the field of view that don’t match the refractive index of the mounting medium appear as bright white. When a particle is mounted in a liquid that matches its refractive index somewhere in the visible wavelengths then those wavelengths are not refracted by the particle and are not collected by the objective. The image of the object is formed by all of the wavelengths that remain. These wavelengths combine to produce a single color that can be used to indicate which band of wavelengths are missing (see Chart 2). Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Darkfield Dispersion Staining. This method is more difficult to interpret due to the single color rather than two bracketing colors but is relatively accurate near the center of the visible range.
Phase contrast dispersion staining.
Phase contrast dispersion staining requires that a phase contrast objective with the appropriate phase annulus in the substage condenser be used to see the effect. It takes advantage of the fact that the rays of light that are not shifted in phase by the presence of the object are separated from the phase shifted rays at the back focal plane of the objective. These 
unaffected rays are then significantly decreased in intensity. With “Positive Phase Contrast” the wavelengths for which the liquid has the higher refractive index color the particle. Because of the physical size of the phase plate and its image onto the back focal plane of the objective where it is modified a halo is created around the particle. This halo takes on the color of the combined wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. The colors seen with this type of dispersion staining are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1. Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Phase Contrast Dispersion Staining. The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.
Objective stop dispersion staining.
Objective stop dispersion staining takes advantage of the fact that all light unaltered by the presence of particles in the field of view is focused at the back focal plane of the objective. If the substage condenser iris is closed down then all of the direct light is focused into a small image of the opening in the substage condenser iris at the back focal plane of the objective. If an opaque stop is place at that position then all of the direct light is blocked and the image of the particle is made up by the wavelengths at which the particles and the mounting liquid do not match. These colors are basically the same as the colors seen when using darkfield dispersion staining. The double aperturing of this method enhances the color effect but also sacrifices resolution of the particles. In fields of view where particles may be stacked or in very close proximity it may be difficult to be sure which small particle is actually producing the color. Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Objective Stop Dispersion Staining. This method is more difficult to interpret due to the single color rather than two bracketing colors but is relatively accurate near the center of the visible range.
Historical development.
Isaac Newton demonstrated that “white” light was actually composed of many different “simple” colors and that materials had different optical properties depending on which of the simple colors was being used to measure them. He demonstrated these facts with a series of experiments using one or more prisms. The difference in the optical properties of materials as a function of the “simple” or monochromatic colors of light is called dispersion. He was also the first person to note that different materials had different dispersion properties. “Sulfurous” liquids (organic liquids) had a higher refractive index than was expected based on their specific gravity and had a steeper dispersion curve than most solids. These well documented observations would take just over two centuries to become an analytical technique.
The first paper documenting dispersion effects seen through the microscope was written in 1872 by O. Maschke in Germany. This paper discussed the occurrence of colored Becke` lines when a particle was in a liquid of matching refractive index. Prior to this paper these colors were thought to be the result of the microscope lenses (chromatic aberration) and not the result of the slide mounted subject and the medium in which it was mounted. In 1884 and 1895 Christian Christiansen published his data on the first analytical application of dispersion colors, the Christiansen filter. He found that by placing a colorless transparent powder into a vial of a colorless organic liquid he could create monochromatic light from white light if the liquid and powder had the same refractive index for just that wavelength. Only that wavelength would see an optically homogeneous media and pass directly through the vial. The other wavelengths would be scattered in all directions by the particles in the liquid. Monochromatic light could be viewed by looking through the vial along the path of the direct beam of light. At any other angle the complementary color of that wavelength would be observed. If he chose a liquid that matched the refractive index of the powder in the far red, 700 nanometers wavelength, he could create any other wavelength by heating the vial, thereby changing the wavelength at which the powder and liquid’s refractive index matched. This technique did not work for any powder or liquid. For optimal effects the powder and the liquid had to be carefully selected so that the intersection of their dispersion curves created as large an angle as possible over the full range of visible wavelengths. Christiansen’s interest was in the creation of monochromatic filters and not the development of an analytical technique. It wasn’t until 1911 that the analytical potential of dispersion effects was reported by F. E. Wright. He observed that the colored Becke` lines noted by Maschke could be used to distinguish between two materials with the same refractive index but different dispersion curves. The colors could also indicate the region of the visible light spectrum for which a particle and liquid it was mounted in had a refractive index match. Wright also noted that by using oblique transmitted illumination the particle would show these colors without having to inspect the Becke` line.
The technical literature had little additional discussion of dispersion effects until 1948. That year S. C. Crossmon, N. B. Dodge, and co-authors R. C. Emmons and R. N. Gates all wrote papers on the use of dispersion effects through the microscope to characterize particles. Crossmon seems to have coined the term “Dispersion Staining” as any optical technique that used the “Christiansen Effect” to produce color in the image of colorless particles. He demonstrated the use of Becke` Line, Oblique Illumination, Darkfield, and Phase Contrast Dispersion Staining methods. S. C. Crossmon and W. C. McCrone have published numerous papers on the use of objective back focal plane stop dispersion staining techniques since that time. Yu. A. Cherkasov published an excellent paper on this topic in 1958 and it was translated into English in 1960. Well over 100 papers have been written on the various methods of dispersion staining and their application since about 1950 and most of these since 1960.
In spite of the early work done on this technique it was not until the 1950s that it became generally known among microscopists. It is now recognized as a powerful tool in the characterization of materials and the detection of low level contaminants. It has demonstrated sensitivity for particle contaminants in powders down to the parts per million. 
The dispersion of the refractive index is a fundamental property of matter. It may be thought of as the result of the relative proximity of the harmonic frequencies of the outer shell electrons in a compound to the frequencies of visible light. The harmonic frequency of the bonding electron is the result of the energy of that bond. If the bond is very strong the frequency will be very high. The higher the frequency the less effect the difference in frequencies from blue to red will have on the refractive index. For the relatively high energy bonds in most inorganic solids this means their refractive indices change very little over the visible range of frequencies. The refractive indices of organic compounds on the other hand, with their lower bonding energies, change significantly over the visible range. This difference in dispersion is the basis of the Christiansen effect and the dispersion staining methods.

Steamboats of the Mackenzie River

The Mackenzie River in Canada's Northwest Territories is a historic waterway, used for centuries by the original Dene as a travel and hunting corridor. It is part of a larger watershed that includes the Slave, Athabasca, and Peace rivers extending from northern Alberta. In the 1780s, Peter Pond, trader with the North West Company discovered this watershed and began viable trade with the Athapascan-speaking Dene of these rivers. The Mackenzie River itself, the great waterway extending to the Arctic Ocean, was first put on European maps by Alexander Mackenzie in 1789, the Scottish trader who explored the river. The watershed thus became a vital part of the fur trade, and before the advent of the airplane or road networks, the river was the only communication link between northern trading posts and the south. Water travel increased in the late 19th century as traders, dominated primarily by the Hudson's Bay Company, looked to increase water services in the Mackenzie River District.
Steamboat service established.
The first steamship to ply in the Mackenzie River watershed was on the Athabasca River in 1882, and its name was the "S.S. Grahame", a sternwheeler built by the HBC, operating from Athabasca Landing north of Edmonton to the Slave River rapids, the only significant obstacle en route to the Mackenzie. In 1886, the "S.S. Wrigley" was launched on the other side of these rapids, at Fort Smith, and for the first time a steam-driven vessel operated on the Mackenzie River as far as Aklavik in the river delta before it spilled into the Arctic Ocean. A series of small portage trails were established between Smith's Landing (later Fort Fitzgerald) and Fort Smith to skirt the 16-mile rapids - this was later upgraded into a full road in the 1920s.
Effect of the Klondike Gold Rush.
In 1898 the Klondike Gold Rush gave an impetus to the exploration of the Canadian North and the Mackenzie River basin was promoted as the best route to the Yukon if one was departing from Edmonton. The 1898-1900 period was very busy for the waterways with many new private vessels built and running between the Athabasca and Mackenzie Rivers. In 1908, the Hudson's Bay Company launched the "S.S. Mackenzie", the first steam-powered shallow-draught sternwheeler ship on the Mackenzie River. In the 1920s, police, church missions, government agents, oil and mining companies, prospectors, and competing fur trade interests descended on the Northwest Territories and water transportation services boomed. Three companies competed for supremacy of the fur trade and water transportation: the Hudson's Bay Company, Lamson & Hubbard Trading Company, Alberta & Arctic Transportation Co., and Northern Traders Company each with a fleet of steam vessels. A series of amalgamations and takeovers left only two main water operators after 1924: the HBC and Northern Traders Co. which later became the Northern Transportation Company Limited (NTCL) in the 1930s. The HBC continued in the business of transportation in conjunction with serving its own posts through Mackenzie River Transport, until 1947 when it got out of public freighting. The "S.S. Distributor", built in 1920 by Lamson & Hubbard, was the flagship of the HBC on the Mackenzie River for over 20 years. Communities such as Waterways and Fort Smith thrived as the base for shipyards along the Athabasca and Slave Rivers, respectively.
Later years.
Most of the old steam-driven vessels were replaced by diesel or gas-powered tug boats in the 1930s and 1940s. The Northern Transportation Company Limited inaugurated a new fleet of steel-hull, diesel tugs in 1937, and the Hudson's Bay Company and its transportation arm Mackenzie River Transport Limited got out of the common carrier business in 1947. The last steam-propelled sternwheelers, the "S.S. Distributor" and "S.S. Mackenzie" were retired around that time. In later years, with the construction of the Mackenzie Highway from Alberta to Great Slave Lake, the importance of the Athabasca-Slave River route dwindled and NTCL operations were based from shipyards in Hay River in the 1970s. The northern barge traffic is still essential to the heavy freight as fuel, food, and heavy equipment can be moved economically in the summer months to communities along the Mackenzie River and oil fields of the Beaufort.

Woldo

The Woldo (literally “moon blade”), was a Korean pole weapon that closely resembled the Chinese guandao (also known as yanyuedao), though proportionally smaller. It was so named because of its curved blade. It and its use methods were described in the Muyedobotongji (“Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts”), which was published in 1795.
Description.
The Muyedobotongji describes its design: “The length of the handle is six feet, four inches; the length of the blade is two feet, eight inches; and the weight is three pounds, 15 ounces.”
It usually had a spike on the end of the handle, and a feather or tassel attached by a ring to the back of the blade. There was a variant of the woldo, called the "danwoldo", which had a bigger blade
History.
Woldo was typically used by the medieval Shilla warrior class the hwarang. Wielding the woldo, because it was heavier than other long-reaching weapons, took time, but, in the hands of a practised user, the 
woldo was a fearsome, agile weapon famous for enabling a single soldier to cut down ranks of infantrymen. Korean cavalrymen, usually in the Choson era, also used the woldo, mainly because it was longer than most other pole weapons and for its heavy striking power. Korean warriors and generals who took military exams to take up high positions in the army had to take an exam that tested proficiency and skill with the woldo. Those who could demonstrate great martial skill in the use of the woldo passed one of the exams and proceeded to the next. Those who could not were ordered to withdraw and to train for the next military examination.
Techniques.
Techniques for the use of this weapon by infantry are described in the earlier Muyejebo, published in 1749. With the publication of the updated version of this manual in 1791, the dismounted techniques were retained, while techniques for use in horseback were added. The latter techniques are called "Masang woldo" (마상월도, 馬上月刀)

Edward Walpole

Sir Edward Walpole KB PC (Ire) (1706 – 12 January 1784) was a British politician, and a younger son of Sir Robert Walpole, Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742. 
Political career.
Walpole first entered Parliament as Member for Lostwithiel in a by-election on 29 April 1730, following the death of Sir Edward Knatchbull earlier that month. He was appointed junior Secretary to the Treasury the same year. 
On 2 May 1734, in the next general election, he succeeded his uncle Horatio Walpole as Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, retaining the seat for nearly 34 years until the 1768 election, when his first cousin the Hon. Richard Walpole (son of Lord Walpole of Wolterton) replaced him. 
On 7 September 1737 the Duke of Devonshire was named Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Walpole his Chief Secretary, though he also continued as Secretary to the Treasury. Walpole was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland on 8 October that year and stood for Ballyshannon in the Irish House of Commons, a seat he held until 1760.
On 9 May 1739 Edward Walpole's elder brother Robert, Lord Walpole resigned his post of Clerk of the Pells in order to become an Auditor of the Exchequer, and Edward was appointed to succeed him, holding the office until his death. On 27 August 1753 Walpole was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath, the order re-founded by his father in 1725.
Family.
Walpole lived at Frogmore House in Windsor in Berkshire. He never married, but left three daughters by his mistress Dorothy Clement:

Hubert Jedin

Hubert Jedin (17 June 1900, Groß Briesen, Friedewalde, Silesia – 16 July 1980, Bonn) was a Catholic Church historian from Germany, whose publications specialized on the history of ecumenical councils in general and the Council of Trent in particular, on which he published a 2400 page history over the years 1951-1975 .
Early years.
He was born in Upper Silesia as one of ten children and studied theology in Breslau, Munich and Freiburg. He was ordained in 1924. In 1927 he went to Rome where he completed a biography of Girolamo Seripando. He returned to Germany in 1930, to teach Church History at the Catholic faculty of the University of Breslau. Because of his Jewish mother, he was defined half-Jewish by the National Socialists. They stripped him of all academic titles and prohibited him from working in public institutions in Germany. Jedin returned to Rome and worked there for the Görres Society. From 1936 until 1939, he worked for his diocese in Breslau. He returned to Rome after narrowly escaping deportation to the Concentration Camp at Buchenwald. 
History of the Council of Trent.
In Rome, he lived at the Campo Santo Teutonico in the Vatican and was thus under the protection of Pope Pius XII during the German occupation. He worked on a history of the Council of Trent, which he published in the years 1951-1976. Jedin created the most comprehensive description of the Council in his "History of the Council of Trent" (Geschichte des Konzils von Trient with about 2400 pages in four volumes: 
Vatican Two.
After the war he was rehabilitated in Germany and accepted a professorship at the University of Bonn in 1948. Pope John XXIII nominated him to assist in the preparation of the Second Vatican Council in 1960. He continued to work for the council until it ended in 1965. 
Publications.
His work includes over seven-hundred titles, including forty books and 250 articles in journals. Jedin issued numerous publications on the council of Trent, which, in his view, determined the relation of Catholics and Protestants for centuries. He addressed issues of controversy, trying to give interpretations of ecumenical perspectives at that time. In addition, he oversaw the publication of a seven-volume "Church History" (1963-1979), an "Atlas of Church History" (1979), and the fundamental "Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche" (1957-1975, "Encyclopedia for Theology and the Church"). As a historian, he leaned on historicism as a method. As a theologian, he was an enlightened conservative, critical of some of the implementations of Vatican Two.

Intergradation

In zoology, intergradation is the way in which two distinct subspecies are connected via areas where populations are found that have the characteristics of both. There are two types of intergradation:
Primary intergradation:
Occurs in cases were two subspecies are connected via one or more intermediate populations, each of which are in turn intermediate to their adjacent populations and exhibit more or less the same amount of variability as any other population within the species. Adjacent populations and subspecies are subject to cline intergradation, and in these situations it is usually taken for granted that the clines are causally related (by selection) to environmental gradients.
Secondary intergradation:
When contact between a geographically isolated subspecies is reestablished with the main body of the species or with another isolate subspecies, interbreeding takes place as long as the isolate has not yet evolved an effective set of isolating mechanisms. Consequently, a relatively distinct zone or belt of hybridization will develop depending on the degree of genetic and phenotypic difference that was achieved by the previously isolated subspecies.

Forever Autumn (song)

"Forever Autumn" is a song written by Jeff Wayne, Gary Osborne and Paul Vigrass. The original melody was written by Wayne in 1969 as a jingle for a Lego commercial. Vigrass and Osborne, the performers of the original jingle, added lyrics to the song and recorded it for inclusion on their 1972 album "Queues". Their interpretation was also released as a single and gained moderate commercial success in Japan, selling more than 100,000 copies and becoming a top-20 hit on the country's record chart.
The best-known version is the recording by Justin Hayward from the album "Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds". Wayne wanted to include a love song on the album that sounded like "Forever Autumn", and he decided that the best course of action was to simply use the original song. Hayward, of The Moody Blues, was hand-picked by Wayne to sing it (because, Wayne said, he "wanted that voice from 'Nights In White Satin'"), and it was recorded at London's Advision Studios in 1976. The song reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart in August 1978.
A new version was released in late 2012, sung by Gary Barlow for the new album "Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – The New Generation".

Leonard Cheshire Disability

Leonard Cheshire Disability is a major health and welfare charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1948 by RAF pilot Leonard Cheshire VC.
In 2006–7 it had a total expenditure of £143 million, placing it in the top 30 of UK charities.
History.
The charity was originally known as The Cheshire Foundation Homes for the Sick, then in 1976 it became the Leonard Cheshire Foundation. In July 2007 it changed to its current style, Leonard Cheshire Disability.
Cheshire started the charity in 1948 with a residential home for disabled ex-servicemen at Le Court, a large country house near Liss in Hampshire. By 1955 there were six Cheshire homes in Britain and the first overseas project was also started in Bombay, India. By 1992 there were 270 homes in 49 countries.
Each of these "Cheshire Homes", as they came to be called were similarly set up; local communities came forward, assembled a group of volunteers, found whatever suitable accommodation they could, set up administrative committees and set about raising funds for development. This gave each Cheshire Home a "local" structure closely knit to the community they were serving while being affiliated with an international organization.
Aims.
The charity is headquartered in London and its stated objects are "to relieve the consequences of physical and/or mental disability by the provision, in the United Kingdom and overseas, of accommodation, services and support for the spiritual, social, physical and/or mental wellbeing of disabled people, by such means as are charitable, whatever their race, nationality, creed, sex or age."
Activities.
It provides support to disabled people through a variety of different services including care at home, residential care and training. It describes itself as "the UK's leading voluntary sector provider of support services for disabled people". Its goal is to change attitudes to disability and to serve disabled people around the world.
LCD's activities are particularly focused on guiding and encouraging the disabled to move toward independence and live life their way.
The Media and Press relations unit of the charity work on influencing public opinion about disability and raising funds for its various objectives.
It also organizes sports and other social events for disabled persons making for an inclusive environment for the disabled.
The Bank Workers Charity (BWC) works in partnership with (LCD) to provide independent and confidential information, advice, guidance and mentoring support to disabled people and carers in the banking community.
Related organisations.
The Ryder-Cheshire Foundation was set up by Leonard Cheshire and his wife Sue Ryder at the time of their marriage in 1959. It now mainly operates in two fields: 
The Leonard Cheshire Disability & Inclusive Development Centre is a joint project by Leonard Cheshire Disability and University College London (originally set up in 1997 as the Leonard Cheshire Centre of Conflict Recovery).
Cheshire founded the Raphael Pilgrimage to enable sick and disabled people to travel to Lourdes.
Sue Ryder Care, a charity founded in 1953 by Sue Ryder, before she met Leonard Cheshire, is also one of the 50 largest charities in the UK.

Maggiora was an Italian coachbuilder from Moncalieri near Turin. They produced the Fiat Barchetta and the Lancia Kappa Coupé which was designed by Centro Stile Lancia. In 2003 the company was closed.
The company was formed in 1925 as "Martelleria Maggiora" by Arturo Maggiora as a high quality car body maker - a coach builder or 'Carrozzeria'. Their work has graced many Fiat and Lancia cars like the early Fiat 1100 Viotti Giardiniettas and the Lancia Flaminia Tourers. The company was grown and extended, with several Abarth and Cisitalia bodies produced. In 1951 it moved to Borgo San Pietro Moncalieri where car like the Glas (BMW) GT (1963), Glas V8 (1965) and the Maserati Mistral (1963) were built. 
Maggiora merged with Sanmarco and Lamier to form "IRMA SpA" in 1991 - later a major supplier to the Ducato range. Maggiora SRL took over the old Lancia factory in Chivasso north of Turin in 1992, and produced there from October 1992 to 1994 the last Integrale Evoluzione. The new capacities in the Lancia factory were later used to produce the Fiat Barchetta - at around 50 bodies a day. Some complete cars were produced here too (including the rare Kappa Coupe). 
In addition many design studies, prototypes, special orders e.g. were produced by Maggiora, these have included soft top Unos and Cinquecentos, special Integrales, a Barchetta Coupes, a Puntograle, the Lancia Thesis Coupe prototype.

Eric Clay

Eric Clay (19 May 1922 – 3 October 2007) was a British rugby league referee popularly known as "Sergeant Major" for his style during games.
Early life, private life.
Born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, Clay was married with two daughters. During the Second World War, Clay was a Warrant Officer in the RAF.
Professional career.
A leading referee, Albert Dobson, suggested that Clay try refereeing. Aged 25, he began in the Leeds and District League in 1947.
It was while refereeing a reserve match as a curtain-raiser to the 1952 Challenge Cup semi-final that Clay's "authoritative presence" was noted. After that he was elevated quickly from Grade 5 to Grade 2, and took charge of his first senior games in 1953–54.
Clay had a distinctive style. He was a "big, even heavy man, he did not race around the field like his modern successors, but he had a knack of being in the right place at the right time to defuse trouble, in a game that was much more violent then than it is now".
Clay became widely recognised due to his regular Saturday afternoon appearances on Grandstand during the 1960s, although he is often better remembered as the Sergeant Major. This nickname, conferred by broadcaster Eddie Waring, "captured the way he controlled a game, like a battle-hardened veteran showing the raw recruits who was in charge".
Two of the major games refereed by Clay were Challenge Cup finals at Wembley, between Wakefield Trinity and Hull in 1960 and Featherstone Rovers and Barrow in 1967. These are the only two Challenge Cup finals to have been attended by the Queen.
Clay was the referee when Great Britain last won the Ashes on home soil in 1959.
Clay was also popular in France, where he was asked to officiate the final of the 1967 Lord Derby Cup between Carcassonne and XIII Catalan in Perpignan.
1963 Ashes.
Clay's most controversial match was the third test of the 1963 Ashes series between Great Britain and Australia played at Headingley, Leeds, in which the two sides set about settling scores and the Australians felt Clay was biased. It is considered was one of the most brutal Tests ever played, with two Australians and one British player, Cliff Watson, being sent off. Barry Muir, one of the Kangaroos sent off (for kicking) later told that he first told Clay "where to go" as he left the field, and later approached Clay after the game and said to him "You robbed us". Clay reportedly responded with "Barry, I've got to live here" (Australia had already won The Ashes and had Great Britain lost the final game it would have been the first time, either as England or Great Britain, that the Lions had lost the series 3-0 on home soil).
Retirement from Rugby League.
After his retirement from refereeing, Clay concentrated on his other job as company secretary of an engineering firm in Leeds. Despite his name remaining one of the best-known in the game, he was rarely seen at rugby league events. There was one exception to that - when Alex Murphy was appointed OBE in 1999, he insisted on the man who sent him off three times accompanying him to Buckingham Palace as one of his guests.
Death.
Eric Clay died in Wheatfields Hospice, Leeds after a short illness. He was 85. A funeral service was held at Rawdon Crematorium on Friday, 12 October 2007 at 12.20pm. 
Dave Hadfield wrote in "The Independent" "Even though he had been retired from refereeing for 35 years by the time of his death, ""Sergeant Major"" Eric Clay remained the most memorable and instantly recognisable figure ever to officiate at rugby league matches in Britain".

Willie Llewellyn

William Morris "Willie" Llewellyn (1 January 1878 – 12 March 1973) was a Welsh international rugby union player. He captained Wales in 1905 and London Welsh in 1902. He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks, toured with the British Isles to Australasia in 1904 and won three Triple Crown trophies. He played club rugby for many teams, predominantly for Llwynypia and Newport.
Club career.
Llewellyn began his club rugby days with Rhondda team Ystrad Rhondda before moving to Llwynypia. Although an unfashionable second tier club, Llwynypia had already provided two Welsh internationals, Dick Hellings and Billy Alexander, and Llewellyn joined their ranks when he was capped in 1899. In 1900 he moved to London to study at the Pharmaceutical College in Bloomsbury and joined a shabby London Welsh team. Llewellyn's arrival is seen as a turning point for the club; he was immediately made captain and turned the team from a losing side to a force to be reckoned with. On his return to Wales, Llewellyn joined first class club, Newport, who he would stay with through four seasons. On his retirement from international rugby Llewellyn returned to second class club rugby and the Rhondda when he joined Penygraig.
International career.
Wales.
Llewellyn made his debut for Wales against England in 1899, alongside Welsh greats Billy Bancroft and Gwyn Nicholls. It was an impressive display from Llewellyn and the team, with England thoroughly beaten and Llewellyn scoring four tries. Llewellyn scored again on his second game, which was against Scotland, and should have scored on his third match when he faced Ireland but for a poor choice by team mate Reg Skrimshire.
Llewellyn was part of the 1900, 1902 and 1905 Triple Crown winning sides, but his true moment of glory was being part of the great Welsh side of 1905 which beat the Original All Blacks. He was considered a poor choice for the game by many critics as at the time of the game he had switched to Penygraig, a junior club, and he was considered too old for the wing. An uncharacteristic fumble within distance of the try line may have proven his detractors correct, but it did not affect the end result and his marking of the All Black Billy Wallace was noted as being ruthlessly impressive.
British Lions.
In 1904 Llewellyn was chosen to tour Australasia alongside fellow Welsh winger Teddy Morgan under the captaincy of Bedell-Sivright. Llewellyn would play in four tests, scoring four tries in the first three tests against Australia.
International games played.

<br>British Isles
Later career and death.
Around 1905 Llewellyn opened a pharmacy in his birth town of Tonypandy. It is reported that during the 1910 Tonypandy Riot the rioters left Llewellyn's pharmacy unscathed due to his sporting celebrity.
When Llewellyn died in 1973 in Pontyclun at the age of 95, he was the last of the 1905 Wales team which beat the Original All Blacks. He is remembered as a modest man who was an excellent captain for club and country and was one of the most devastating wing players in Welsh rugby history.

Buchanania arborescens

Buchanania arborescens, Little gooseberry tree, is a small slender tree native to monsoon forests of northern Australia, south-east Asia, and the Solomon Islands.
The leaves are spirally arranged, smooth, leathery, elongated oblong, 5–26 cm long. The flowers are very small cream to yellowish white. The edible fruit are globular, small (1 cm long), reddish to purple-black.
These are eaten by Torresian imperial pigeons and other birds.
The species was formally described in 1826 by botanist Carl Ludwig Blume based on plant specimens collected from Java. Initially naming it "Coniogeton arborescens", Blume transferred the species to the genus "Buchanania" in 1850.
In Australia the species occurs naturally across the northern extremities of the continent from Western Australia and across the Northern Territory to Queensland where it extends down the east coast as far south as Hinchinbrook Island.
Uses.
Aboriginal people eat the fruit raw. The plant is also used as a traditional medicine in Australia and Malaysia.

<doc id="18500670" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18500670" title="Murder of Ofir Rahum">
Murder of Ofir Rahum

The Murder of Ofir Rahum was a shooting attack which occurred on 17 January 2001, in which Palestinian militants from the Tanzim faction of Fatah killed 16-year-old Israeli high school student Ofir Rahum on the outskirts of Ramallah.
The murder was planned and initiated by a Palestine Liberation Organization collaborator, 24-year-old Mona Jaud Awana from Bir Nabala. After many weeks in which Mona conducted long private conversations in English with Rahum through the instant messenger program ICQ, during which she masqueraded as a Jewish immigrant from Morocco named Sally, Mona managed to gain his confidence and get him to meet with her in Jerusalem, supposedly for romantic purposes. When he arrived for the meeting, she drove him through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory and towards a secluded area on the outskirts of Ramallah where Palestinian terrorists shot him at close range, with Mona standing aside and watching.
Background.
Mona Awana, later arrested by the Israeli police, stated that on the day of the lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah in late 2000 by a Palestinian mob, she decided to abduct an Israeli and murder him. Mona had been present at the Ramallah lynching, and said she was "excited" by what she saw. Soon after, she began contacting Israelis on the Internet. Awana chatted with several Israeli teenagers on chat rooms and engaged in an online romance with Rahum. In conversations over several months she pressed for a meeting in Jerusalem. When Rahum suggested a venue closer to his home, she claimed she had no car but promised to arrange for his return by 5 P.M. Employing sexual innuendos, she persuaded him to meet her. Two days before the murder, she wrote, "You don't know how much I am waiting for Wednesday." When they met, she convinced him to accompany her to Ramallah.
The murder.
On 17 January 2001, Mona and Rahum met at the central bus station in Jerusalem, spoke briefly in English, and then got on a taxi which drove to the el-Ram intersection. From there they drove in a Ford Escort with Israeli license plates, through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory and towards the outskirts of Ramallah. When Rahum questioned Mona why they were traveling through Arab-dominant areas, Mona replied that "that's the way it is in Jerusalem, which has both Arab and Jewish neighborhoods."
At 11:30, Mona stopped the car at a secluded area on the outskirts of Ramallah next to a car with Palestinian license plates, at a location which was chosen in advance with the Palestinian militant cell. Mona immediately jumped out of the vehicle, while the militants, Hassan Alkadi and Abdul Fatah Doleh, armed with rifles, got out of their car and shot Rahum from close range more than 15 times, while all along Mona was standing aside and watching. Afterwards, the assailants threw Rahum's body into the trunk and fled to Ramallah.
The assailants secretly buried Rahum's body in the al-Tira neighborhood in Ramallah.
Investigation.
After Rahum did not return home from school, his family began looking for him, and found out that he did not go to school that day. Following further investigation by the Israeli Shin Bet security agency and the Israeli International Crimes Unit, it was revealed that Rahum corresponded with Mona through the Internet and that she pressed Rahum to meet with her in Jerusalem, and that she promised to have intimate relations with him.
Meanwhile, an undercover Israeli Duvdevan Unit force, in conjunction with the Shin Bet, raided Mona's house in Bir Nabala and managed to apprehend Mona. She was later interrogated by the Shin Bet.
On 18 January, Palestinian security forces located Rahum's body and brought it to the Ramallah hospital. A short time later, his body was transferred to Israel.
Although Mona initially refused to cooperate with the investigators, she broke down after about four weeks and gave a full confession of her involvement in the murder, and revealed the identities of her partners in crime – the senior Ramallah-area Fatah Tanzim operatives Hassan Alkadi and Abdul Fatah Doleh of Beituniya.
Aftermath.
The murder caused great shock amongst the Israeli public. The Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated in response to the murder that the attack was a "heinous crime committed by vile killers, lacking human dignity.

Thousands of people attended Rahum's funeral which was held on 19 January at noon in the Ashkelon cemetery. Rahum's gravestone was built in the form of a personal computer.
Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations wrote to the Secretary-General to protest the "recent acts of Palestinian terrorism directed against Israeli civilians".
Awana was tried, and eventually convicted of murder in February 2003 and sentenced to life imprisonment. She was later transferred to the Neveh Tirza prison in 2006 after attacking another inmate.
Though the Israeli government initially said that Awana would not be part of the deal, she was released to Gaza on 18 October 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas. Awana is now residing in exile in Turkey.
Abbas-Awana meeting.
On 20 December 2011, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas privately met Awana in Ankara, for which he was criticized by Israel. Abbas said that the release of the remaining Palestinian prisoners in Israel was at the top of the Palestinian agenda. An Israeli government spokesman said that the Israeli government was "disappointed" by this decision, and that "instead of promoting peace and reconciliation, the Palestinian leadership seems to be putting extremist murderers up on a pedestal. This raises serious questions as to their commitment and as to their desire to end the conflict."

Isle of Swords

Isle of Swords is a pirate novel for young adults by Wayne Thomas Batson, also author of The Door Within Trilogy. First published in 2007, it tells of sailors, pirates, and a mysterious group of monks all working to get a great treasure, the treasure of Constantine. A sequel, "Isle of Fire", was published in 2008.
Plot summary.
The fates of the crew of the "William Wallace" are dramatically altered when Anne, daughter of the pirate Captain Declan Ross, finds a young man unconscious on a deserted island. The young boy had been nearly whipped to death and, when the kind crew of the "William Wallace" revives him, he has no memory at all of his past. He soon becomes friends with the crew members, particularly Anne. All they can determine of the boy's past is that, judging from his confident, daring sailing skills, he was once a pirate. They dub him Cat based on both his ability to survive his violent whipping and the instrument that probably did it: the cat o'nine tails.
Later, when stopping briefly at a monastery, Captain Ross agrees to the request of the monks dwelling there: to take one of their number, Padre Dominguez, aboard and keep him safe. Their reason is the priceless map tattooed on Dominguez's back, a map leading to the Isle of Swords, where the legendary Treasure of Constantine awaits. The monks know that Bartholomew Thorne is after the great riches and, hence, after Dominguez.
On their route to the Isle of Swords, the ship docks temporarily at an island that seems vaguely familiar to Cat. Though both he and Anne were ordered to stay aboard, Anne encourages her friend to come with her and sneak away from the ship for a time. Cat reluctantly agrees to the mutinous act, and they steal ashore to search for clues to his past. They discover an abandoned pirate stronghold that holds signs of a gruesome past, and, to Cat's horror, the place seems slightly familiar. While trying to flee the place he and Anne are captured by a group of British soldiers headed by Commodore Blake. They believe the two young pirates know something about the fort and the whereabouts of its former inhabitant: Bartholomew Thorne.
Anne manages to escape and tells Declan of Cat's plight. Ross rallies a group of men to help him and, together with local friend Jacques St. Pierre, they heroically spring Cat from the island's British jail. Taking Jacques with them, the crew of the "William Wallace" sets off again.
After being punished for their mutinous behavior, Cat and Anne sign the ship's articles and become official members of the crew. When Ross later stops at another island to pick up some final supplies, in his absence Thorne attacks the "William Wallace". He burns the ship and takes Anne and Padre Dominguez as prisoner.
When Ross discovers this he is devastated, but quickly harnesses his emotions into hard resolve to get Anne back. With the help of his remaining crew members, including Cat, he buys a ship to chase after Thorne.
In the prison of one of Bartholomew's strongholds, two of Thorne's crewmen make the fatal error of whipping Dominguez without their captain's permission. Now that some of the map is destroyed, Thorne resorts to torturing the monk to make him explain what is broken on the map. When this fails, Bartholomew turns his torture instruments on Anne, and at this Dominguez breaks down and tells everything. Thorne, satisfied, leaves Padre in his cell to bleed to death and takes Anne with him, on to the Isle of Swords.
Ross, close behind Thorne, is not close enough to save Dominguez. When he discovers Bartholomew's deserted fort, Padre is almost dead. The monk manages to assure Ross that Anne is still alive, and then Dominguez dies.
In a final confrontation in the treasure chamber on the Isle of Swords, Thorne and Ross's crews face off. The battle ends when Thorne, after identifying with shock Cat as his son, gains the upper hand. He ties Cat, Ross, and Anne to pillars in the chamber, which is beginning to become unstable due to the eruption of a nearby volcano. The rest of Ross's crew is forced to join Thorne and he leads them down to his ships, where they begin loading treasure.
Due to some secret help from Stede, Cat, Anne, and Ross escape, though the latter is injured. They escape to their ship and a sea battle begins. Ross's crew in the enemy ships sabotage them and then escape to Declan's side. Commodore Blake, too, joins the fray, having been carefully tipped off earlier by Ross of Thorne's whereabouts. Thorne is captured and Ross is invited to meet with the British for a parlay.
At the meeting with the Commodore, Ross begins to work out a peaceable offer with Blake about offering a pardon to pirates who stop their ways. Suddenly, however, a vast tidal wave strikes the town, completely submerging the prison where Thorne was held. The Commodore, Declan and his group rush to the jails and find, to their horror, that Bartholomew has disappeared.
Characters.
Declan Ross - Pirate captain of the "William Wallace". He is a brave, kind man who, even though a pirate, discourages violence and promotes mercy. Ross's wife Abigail died under mysterious circumstances when their daughter, Anne, was very young.
Anne Ross - Declan's daughter. Red-headed, feisty and proud, she adores the perilous sailing life.
Cat - A friendly young lad who is fond of Anne. Though he lost most of his life's memories because of an injury, he is proving himself an adept seaman and a valiant fighter.
Bartholomew Thorne - The villain of this story. His cruelty on land and at sea had earned him the reputation of one of the most notorious pirates of the Caribbean. Because of a fire set by the English, Thorne's hands and voice were scarred and his favorite wife Heather was killed. Chiefly because of the death of his wife, Thorne harbors a deadly, vengeful hatred against the British.
Padre Dominguez - a quiet, tall monk who is nonetheless an extraordinary fighter. On his back is tattooed a map to the Isle of Swords.
Commodore Blake - A brave Commodore in British Navy, who, though technically Ross's enemy, holds a grudging respect for the honorable pirate.
Nigel - Blake's right hand man.
Stede - Declan Ross's quartermaster, an intensely loyal man with a pronounced accent and a fierce "thunder gun".
Scully - A ratlike little man who works for Thorne, chiefly as a messenger and spy.
Red Eye - A "powder monkey" on the "William Wallace". He is so named because of a reddish-tinged, blinded eye, the result of a past incident involving some gunpowder. Though equipped with a fierce passion for all things sharp and dangerous, he a good friend and very faithful to Ross.
Jacques St. Pierre - Master of all things explosive. With a passion for "things that go BOOM!", this elegant yet naturally dangerous Frenchman joins Declan's crew midway through the book.
Jules - Ross's largest and physically strongest crew member. Like nearly all of the men on the "Robert Bruce", he is very devoted to his captain and shipmates.
Nubby - The fierce, one-armed cook of the "William Wallace".
Drake- The oldest crew member on the "William Wallace", and one who adheres closely to the laws of the sea and its superstitions.
Setting.
The story takes place mostly in the real-world Caribbean and in the North Atlantic. No specific dates are given in the novel, but muskets have been invented, and slavery is still around, though only mentioned once with distaste in the book, so the estimated time period is the 18th century.
Sequel.
The sequel, "Isle of Fire", was released on Sept. 9th, 2008.

Forensic developmental psychology

Forensic developmental psychology is a field of psychology that focuses on "children's actions and reactions in a forensic context" and "children's reports that they were victims or witnesses of a crime". Bruck and Poole (2002) first coined the term "forensic developmental psychology". Although forensic developmental psychology specifically focuses on a child's reliability, credibility, and competency in the courtroom setting, it also includes topics such as autobiographical memory, memory distortion, eyewitness identification, narrative construction, personality, and attachment.
Child testimony process.
Similar to adults, children who testify must undergo a testimony process in order to determine their relative competency, reliability, and credibility. This is important because trauma resulting from exposure to an open courtroom or confrontation with a defendant can ultimately lead to inaccurate testimony.
There are several similarities and differences between the competency evaluation for adults and for children. Both adults and children must be deemed as competent in order to testify in court. With regards to children, competency refers to a child's capacity and relative intelligence, his or her ability to distinguish between truth and lie, and his or her duty to tell the truth. In order to determine a child's competency, four factors may be considered: 
These guidelines were determined by the Wheeler v. United States (1985) Supreme Court case in which a 5-year-old boy was the only witness to a murder. The boy's testimony was ruled as admissible on the grounds that he was "sufficiently intelligent", could "distinguish between truth and lies", and understand that he was "morally obligated to tell the truth". Although federal guidelines exist for determining a child's competency, the capacities required for a child to be deemed competent also vary from state to state. For example, some states may require a child to be able to differentiate between truth and lie as well as recall past incidents, whereas other states may only require that the child is able to tell the truth.
Along with competency, a child's reliability and credibility must be tested as well. However, the guidelines for a determining a child's reliability and credibility are not as stringent as determining the child's competency. Although it is important to establish a child's relative reliability and credibility for his or her testimony, a judge cannot bar a witness from testifying on the grounds that he or she is competent but not credible.
Factors impacting children's reports.
Although measures exist to try and prevent poor reliability, credibility, and accuracy of children's reports, research of the child testimony process indicates that there are several difficulties that may be associated with the child testimony process, especially with regards to eyewitness testimony. Topics such as language development, memory skills, susceptibility to suggestion, the truth-lie competency, and credibility and deception detection are currently being researched to determine their impact on a child's competency, reliability, and credibility.
Language development.
Individual differences in language development and compehension may cause difficulties in determining a child's relative competence with the child testimony process and the trial. Although attorneys are required to use language that is developmentally appropriate with young child witnesses, children may still have difficulty understanding the difficult terminology associated with the courtroom. Even if a child's report is accurate, adults can also make inaccurate inferences based on his or her report. However, some research suggests that the reliability of children's communicative competence can be minimized by better and clearer instructions as well as by more thorough preparation before the trial.
Memory skills.
The inconsistency of children's memory potentially creates a problem with the reliability of children's reports. A study done by Klemfuss and Ceci (2012) indicates that "general memory skill is inconsistently associated with children's accuracy". Children younger than the age of 6 also tend to remember a higher proportion of details inaccurately in their reports when compared to children of ages 8 and 10. Along with the problem of poor memory development at a young age, there is a problem with remembering information accurately after a certain period of time. According to Beuscher and Roberts (2005), individuals tend to remember a higher ratio of accurate to inaccurate information over time.
Susceptibility to suggestion.
Suggestibility is defined by Ceci and Bruck (1995) as "the degree to which the encoding, storage, retrieval, and reporting of events can be influenced by internal and external factors". Although children's autobiographical recall can be highly accurate in many situations, increased exposure to suggestion can potentially increase the inaccuracy of a child's report. While previous research focused on the impact of a single piece of misinformation on the accuracy of children's reports, current research is now focusing on how multiple suggestive techniques affect the accuracy of children's reports. Ceci & Friedman (2000) suggest that a combination of implicit and explicit suggestive techniques such as bribes, threats, and repetitions of questions can have a large impact on young children's reports. These techniques are especially prevalent when interviewer bias is present during an interview with a child. Interviewer bias refers to when an interviewers' own prejudices or opinions about the event influence the manner in which they conduct the interview, and can occur when interviewers mold the interview to maximize disclosures that are consistent with their beliefs by gathering confirmatory evidence and neglecting disconfirmatory evidence.
Several other factors may contribute to a child's susceptibility to suggestion such as internal or external factors. For example, the child's memory report could have been permanently altered which would be an internal factor, or the child could simply be trying to please the report interviewer or another adult which would be an external factor. Another factor that contributes to increased susceptibility to suggestion is seen through the use of peer pressure. Ceci and Bruck (2002) stated that children who were exposed to higher amounts of peer pressure were more prone to change their perception of the event in question even if their initial report was accurate. Although it is difficult to predict whether or not a child will be more susceptible to suggestion, age and language skills are currently the most reliable predictors of children's resistance to suggestion.
Truth-lie competency.
Another difficulty encountered with a child's credibility and reliability in the courtroom setting is truth-lie competency. Truth-lie competency refers to a child's relative accurate conception of the truth, and how a child perceives the truth when compared to an adult's perceptions. In order to determine whether a child is providing truthful testimony, the judge must determine whether the child has an accurate conception of the truth from an adult perspective before the child's testimony. There are three traditional methods of assessing a child's ability to differentiate between truth and lies such as asking the child to (1) define two concepts, (2) explain the difference between truth and lies and (3) identify examples of truth and lies statements.
Although limited, research suggests that young children may have differing definitions of lies than older children and adults. Developmentally inappropriate methods of gauging a child's truth-lie competency could also hinder a child's ability to distinguish between truth and lie. Two specific factors that may also influence a child's definition of a lie include the intention of the speaker and the virulence of what is said. Furthermore, a child's perception of the truth can be influenced by personal gain or reward or by the child's desire to please significant others such as parents, lawyers, or therapists.
Credibility and deception detection.
Although the legal system takes care to ensure that children are sufficiently competent before testifying, it is still difficult to determine a child's credibility. Because of the relative difficulty in determining a child's reliability and credibility, few techniques exist to determine a child's ability to recount narratives accurately. One potential method of determining the reliability of a child's report is by the number of "fantastical" or highly implausible or imaginary details within the narrative. According to Bruck, Ceci, & Hembrooke (2002), a higher number of fantastical details are correlated with false narratives. Furthermore, children who describe false narratives tend to creatively utilize incorrect information to construct a false narrative. Research also suggests that the accuracy and credibility of children's reports are closely related when reports are influenced by suggestion.
A study done by Nysse-Carris et al. (2011) had adults rate videos of children's truthfulness and deceitfulness. The study's results indicated that the adults' accuracy was low (only slightly above chance) when rating the children. Furthermore, the study concluded that adults tend to be more biased in labeling children as liars. In general, adults—even adults who are experts in the field—cannot reliably predict the accuracy of a child's report or a child's competence.

Berg Castle (Bavaria)

Berg Castle () is situated on the east shore of Lake Starnberg in the village of Berg in Upper Bavaria, Germany.
History.
Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, acquired a tract of land on the shores of Lake Starnberg in 1676 from the Horwarth family, where he ordered the construction of Berg Castle. Ferdinand used it himself for festivities, but it reached its zenith under his successors Max Emanuel and Charles VII, when it was often the scene of spectacular entertainments and hunts.
Between 1849 and 1851 King Maximilian II instructed the architect Eduard Riedel to redesign the castle in Neo-Gothic style, with added crenellations and four towers, for which the king bought additional land. (Maximilian's son Ludwig II of Bavaria had a fifth tower constructed, which he called "Isolde"). In 1853 Maximilian had a small private harbour built.
Ludwig II used the castle as his summer residence, moving here regularly every year on 11 May and performing the business of state from it. For this purpose he had a telegraph connection installed between the castle and Munich.
In 1868 the Czarina of Russia Maria Alexandrovna visited Berg at the King's invitation. Ludwig gave her the castle to live in for the duration of her visit and had it magnificently decorated for the occasion: the castle was otherwise, by Ludwig's standards, rather modestly appointed.
The surrounding park had been treated by his predecessors in the fashions of the times, from a Baroque formal garden to an English landscaped garden. Ludwig had the "Moorish Kiosk" set up here which Franz von Seitz had designed and built for the Winter Garden on the roof of the Munich Residenz.
In 1876 the King had a small chapel built.
On June 12, 1886, Ludwig, who had been declared medically incapable of ruling shortly before, and deposed, was transported to Berg Castle. On June 13 he was found dead, floating in the shallow water near the shore, with his doctor, von Gudden. The deaths remain unexplained, despite an official explanation of drowning. A votive chapel and a memorial cross set in the lake form a memorial.
After the king's death the castle became a museum and in 1939 was declared a monument, as it had not been changed since Ludwig's death, and had thus acquired not only an historical but also a cultural significance.
After World War II the castle was occupied by American soldiers, who damaged it severely, compounding previous damage caused by the war, especially to the corner towers. It was repaired and completely renovated from 1949 to 1951; the corner towers were entirely removed and the building was restored on the basis of what it had been before Maximilian's intervention, although the chapel was left. Today the castle continues to be a home for the head of the house of Wittelsbach, currently Franz, Duke of Bavaria.

Humoresques (Dvořák)

Humoresques (), Op. 101 (B. 187), is a piano cycle by the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák, written during the summer of 1894. One writer says "the seventh Humoresque is probably the most famous small piano work ever written after Beethoven's "Für Elise." 
History.
During his stay in America, when Dvořák was director of the Conservatory in New York from 1892 to 1895, the composer collected many interesting musical themes in his sketchbooks. He used some of these ideas in other compositions, notably the "From the New World" Symphony, the "American" String Quartet, the Quintet in E Flat Major, and the Sonatina for Violin, but some remained unused.
In 1894 Dvořák spent the summer with his family in Bohemia, at Vysoká u Příbrami. During this "vacation", Dvořák began to use the collected material and to compose a new cycle of short piano pieces. On 19 July 1894 Dvořák sketched the first Humoresque in B major, today number 6 in the cycle. However, the composer soon started to create scores for the pieces that were intended to be published. The score was completed on 27 August 1894. 
The cycle was entitled Humoresques shortly before Dvořák sent the score to his German publisher F. Simrock. The composition was published by Simrock in Autumn, 1894. 
The publisher took advantage of the great popularity of the seventh Humoresque to produce arrangements for many instruments and ensembles. The piece was later also published as a song with various lyrics. It has also been arranged for choir. The melody was also used as the theme of Slappy Squirrel in the popular animated television show "Animaniacs". In 2004 the vocal group Beethoven's Wig used Humoresque as the basis for a song entitled Dvořák the Czechoslovak.
Structure.
The cycle consists of eight pieces:
The main theme of the first Humoresque was sketched in New York on New Year's Eve 1892, with the inscription ""Marche funèbre"" (sic). The minor theme was accompanied with the inscription ""people singing in the street"". The opening theme of the fourth piece was also sketched in New York, among ideas intended for the unrealized opera "Hiawatha". The "American" style is also apparent in other themes of the Humoresques.
Recordings.
Edith Lorand Chamber Orchestra with violin solo by Edith Lorand. Recorded on February 12, 1932. Released in Germany on the 78 rpm record Parlophon B 48161.
New Light Symphony Orchestra. Recorded in New York City on December 30, 1933. It was released by Victor Records as catalogue number 44344 (in USA) and by EMI on the HMV Records label as catalogue number B 3926.
"Passengers will please refrain...".
In the United States, Dvořák's Humoresque Number 7 became the setting for a series of mildly scatological humorous verses, regarding passenger train toilets, beginning:
The tune together with these words has achieved the status of a "traditional" folk song, often entitled simply "Humoresque". As with all folk art, there are many variations and innumerable verses, often describing troublesome bathroom predicaments and unlikely solutions.
A 1989 letter published in the "Orlando Sentinel" refers to it:
This dating is consistent with the song's mention in a 1941 novel. A 2008 memoir of 1930s life on a Carolina plantation describes a railroad trip in a Pullman car and notes:
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas claimed that the humorous lyrics to Dvořák's music were the work of himself and of Yale law professor Thurman Arnold. "The Erotic Muse: American Bawdy Songs" says that

The Elusive Corporal () is a 1962 French comedy film directed by Jean Renoir and starring Jean-Pierre Cassel. It was entered into the 12th Berlin International Film Festival. Renoir shot his film in Austria in 1961 from Jacques Perret's book based on his own prisoner of war experiences. Renoir's friend and assistant director Guy Lefranc had also been a World War II prisoner of war and had developed the project for seven years.
The story serves as a companion piece to the director's 1937 film, "Grand Illusion", once more bringing together men from across the broad social spectrum of French society to depict one man's Sisyphean efforts to escape captivity in a German POW camp.

The Overloaded Ark

The Overloaded Ark, first published in 1953, is the debut book by British naturalist Gerald Durrell. It is the chronicle of a six months collecting trip to the West African colony of British Cameroon - now Cameroon - (Dec 1947 - Aug 1948) - that Durrell made with the highly regarded aviculturist and ornithologist John Yealland.
Their reasons for going on the trip were twofold - ' to collect and bring back alive some of the fascinating animals, birds, and reptiles that inhabit the region,' and secondly, for both men to realise a long cherished dream to see Africa. 
Its combination of comic exaggeration and environmental accuracy, portrayed in Durrell's light, clever prose, made it a great success. It launched Durrell's career as a writer of both non-fiction and fiction, which in turn financed his work as a zookeeper and conservationist.
"The Bafut Beagles" and "A Zoo in My Luggage" are sequels of sorts, telling of his later returns to the region.
History.
Durrell had married Jacqueline Sonia Wolfenden (Jacquie Durrell), 21, a music student, on 26 February 1951. She knew that he could keep a company spellbound with his talk, and wondered why he couldn't present stories of his animal collecting to a wider audience. Durrell, having criticized a BBC radio talk about life in West Africa, sent in a fifteen-minute radio script about his trials attempting to catch a hairy frog in the Cameroons. It was his first piece of professional writing. 
The BBC accepted the script, which he read, live, on the BBC Home Service the morning of Sunday 9 December 1951. The Overloaded Ark appeared in 1953.

Tiggywinkles

Tiggywinkles is an animal welfare charity and veterinary hospital in the United Kingdom, also known as St Tiggywinkles and The Wildlife Hospital Trust. It specialises in the rescue and treatment of wild animals. The name derives from the hedgehog character in Beatrix Potter's story "The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle".
It is based at Haddenham in Buckinghamshire, where it operates an animal hospital and visitor centre, and teaches wild animal practice to veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses.
It was formally constituted in February 1983 by Les Stocker MBE HonAssocRCVS. It is a charity registered in England & Wales as The Wildlife Hospital Trust, and in 2006–7 had an annual expenditure of £1,005,614.
Les Stocker has written a number of books based on the work of the hospital, including a veterinary manual ("Practical Wildlife Care", WileyBlackwell, 2nd edition, 2005) and a popular account ("Something in a Cardboard Box: Tales from a Wild Life Hospital", Chatto & Windus, 1989).
Stocker was the recipient of a Rolex Award for Enterprise in 1990 for his work at the hospital. In 1991 he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to wildlife.
Beginning in July 2008, Tiggywinkles featured in a 20 part, half hour documentary TV series produced by Two Hand Productions, and shown on Channel Five in the UK – "Wild Animal ER" – presented by Kate Gerbeau.

Saint Columban College

Saint Columban College is a leading Private Catholic educational institution run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pagadian, founded by the Missionary Society of St. Columban (MSSC) in consortium with the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartes (SPC) in Pagadian City, Republic of the Philippines.
It is the flagship school of the sixteen(16)-member Diocesan Schools Group of Pagadian and is also one of the largest academic institutions in the Zamboanga Peninsula region.
History.
As Saint Columban School.
Saint Columban School(SCS) was established in 1957 by Fr. Sean Nolan of the Missionary Society of St. Columban(MSSC), Sisters Teresita del Niño Jesus Reyes, Isabel of the Angels Narciso, Marie Odille Cayetano and Anne Bacomo of the Sisters of Saint Paul de Chartres (SPC). Under the leadership of Fr. Partick Campion of the MSSC, SCS earned "full operation status."
Following the success of its high school, in 1963, SCS began to offer collegiate programs. The college department piloted with programs under Liberal Arts, Education, Secretarial, and Commerce. With the expansion, SCS sought the development of a larger campus to cater its collegiate student population with the construction of the 3-storey building which today serves as the main campus, housing the Grade School after the College Department moved to its current campus in 1970.
In 1963, SCS opened the college department with programs under Commerce, Education, Liberal Arts, and Secretarial. With the growing number of its college students, SCS sought an expansion of its facility which lead to the construction of the 3-storey building for the college department, but was turned over to the grade school department when the college department was moved to its current campus in 1970.
SCS only opened its basic education component in 1965 under Sister Eugenie de Marie of the SPC as principal.
As Saint Columban College.
With the incorporation of the basic, secondary, and tertiary components, in 1967, Saint Columban School(SCS) was renamed Saint Columban College(SCC) when it up scaled as a tertiary academic institution.
In 1978, SCC was turned over by the MSSC to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pagadian through Bishop Jesus Tuquib who served as Chairman of the Board Trustees. Fr. Jose Maria Luengo was installed as the first Filipino President of the institution. Luengo with Bishop Patricio Getigan and Sister Agnes Lawrence Catalan also composed the "SCC Hymn" which until day, is used as the institution's ceremonial march.
In 1982, SCC celebrated its 25th Anniversary and inaugurated a new 4-storey building in the college campus. The building houses the College of Business Education.
Recent History-Present.
In 2002, Saint Columban College opened its College of Computer Studies which today, bears the distinction of being the "Center of Development and Excellence in Information Technology" in Region IX, as recognized by the Commission on Higher Education.
On November 8, 2006, the main building of the high school which was then one of the oldest buildings of SCC was totally destroyed by fire. The event left the High School maximizing the secondary academic building and some grade school classrooms for 1 year.
In 2008, SCC inaugurated phase 1 of its new high school main building which houses a number of classrooms, a chemistry laboratory,an audio-visual room, a library, 2 computer laboratories, a school clinic, and the offices of the faculty, school treasurer, registrar, guidance counselor, and school principal.
In 2011, SCC built a new administrative building in its college campus to pursue a facade overhaul for the campus. The building houses the administrative offices, the guidance and counseling center, and a chapel.
Campuses.
Saint Columban College has three(3) campuses. Although the Grade School and High School campuses are on geographically interconnected lands, they are technically divided by the boundary between Balangasan and Sto. Niño Districts of the City.
Facilities.
There are other facilities that have not been enlisted, but are, for practical reasons, existing due to the compliance of SCC to the requirements of higher learning.

Governance.
Bishop Emmanuel T. Cabajar, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pagadian, sits as Chairman of the Board of Trustees with Fr. Gilbert Hingone, STL, member of the board and School President, and Sister Amelia David, ICM, member of the board and Diocesan Schools' Superintendent.
All students from the Grade School, High School, and College departments are represented by their respective student body organizations.

Kleindienst v. Mandel

Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the United States Attorney General has the right to refuse somebody's entry to the United States, as he has been empowered to do so in 212 (a) (28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.
This action was brought to compel Attorney General Kleindienst to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician whom the American plaintiff-appellees, Ernest Mandel et al., had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in the US. The alien had been found ineligible for admission under 212 (a) (28) (D) and (G) (v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish "the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism." Kleindienst had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under 212 (d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted.

Gifford Beal

Gifford Beal (January 24, 1879 – February 5, 1956) was an American artist noted for his work as a painter, watercolorist, printmaker and muralist.
Early life.
Born in New York City, Gifford Beal was the youngest son in a family of six surviving children. His oldest brother Reynolds Beal (1866–1951) also went on to become an accomplished painter as did his niece Marjorie Acker (1894–1985), who married Duncan Phillips, the founder of The Phillips Collection of Washington D.C.
Beal knew from an early age that he wanted to paint. Between 1892 and 1901 he studied with William Merritt Chase (1849–1916) on weekends in New York City and during the summer at Chase’s School in Shinnecock Hills, Long Island.
After graduating from Princeton University in 1900 he studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1901 to 1903 with George Brandt Bridgman (1864–1943) and Frank Vincent DuMond (1865–1951).
Career rise and recognition.
In 1903 Beal won his first award (3rd prize) in a competitive exhibition, held at Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts. Many prizes followed including those awarded by:
Beal was elected President of the Art Students League of New York in 1916, again in 1918, and from 1920 he held this office continuously until 1930, becoming the longest serving President in its history. He taught at The Art Students’ League in 1931 and 1932. 
In 1920 Beal held his first one-man exhibition at Kraushaar Galleries in New York City. It was the beginning of a lifelong relationship he would have with the gallery. His work was exhibited continuously in the country.
Beal’s involvement with organizations for the advancement of the arts began in 1908 when he was elected to Associate by the National Academy of Design; in 1914 he was elected to National Academician. In 1923 he became a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1943 he became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was a National Academician of the American Watercolor Society from 1910 until 1955. He was also a member of the Century Association, a New York City club founded in 1847 for artists and writers.
Museums and government buildings.
Beal’s work is held in a number of museum collections including:
Additionally Beal was commissioned to produce murals for two government buildings:
Gifford Beal Archive.
The Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. holds an archive concerning Beal’s career as an artist containing correspondence, writings, works of art and printed material, much of it provided by Kraushaar Galleries, New York City. This collection has been fully digitized and is available online.
Style and inspiration.
Beal’s subjects varied. He found inspiration not only in holiday spectacle and pageantry but also in the natural and everyday side of life. Some of his best known pictures are of holiday crowds, circus performers and hunting scenes. Yet, Beal enjoyed painting the Caribbean Islands and the landscape along the Hudson River and in Gloucester and Rockport, Massachusetts, where he spent many summers. He depicted many scenes of the fishermen who worked there.
The French Impressionists' use of color and light to create form and atmosphere provided Beal's first influence. As his personal style developed, other elements of painting were emphasized: compositions were built on line and form thereby adding more solidity to the work. For example, he depended on balanced, rhythmic elements to depict motion in riding or fishing scenes. Beal believed in the power of spontaneity and would sometimes rework a "dead" area of color with line in order to revitalize it.
Beal's style underwent a simplification in the 1930s, his "austere" phase which coincided with American regionalism. As he grew older, his work became increasingly free and spirited, in part due to his exploration of different media, especially egg/oil tempera and brush and ink. These changes increased his sense of color and gesture, and he began to emphasize the abstract qualities of his subject. He did some of his boldest and brightest work during the last years of his life.

Refraction microtremor

Refraction microtremor (ReMi) is a surface-performed geophysical survey developed by Dr. John Louie (and others) based on previously existing principles of evaluating surface waves and in particular Rayleigh waves. The refraction microtremor technology was developed at the University of Nevada and is owned by the State of Nevada. Optim of Reno, Nevada has the exclusive license to develop the technology, and SeisOpt® ReMi™ has been available commercially from Optim since 2004. Since Rayleigh waves are dispersive, the propagating waves are measured along a linear seismic array and evaluated relative to wave frequency and slowness (or the inverse of the velocity). Due to the dispersive characteristics of higher frequency waves travelling through the more shallow conditions and lower frequency waves passing through deeper materials, a 1-D subsurface profile can be generated based on the velocity with depth.
Equipment and Field Procedures
The method utilizes equipment typically employed in seismic refraction surveys. This equipment consists of a seismograph, geophones placed in an array, and a seismic source. An array consists of 6 to 48+ geophones placed at some interval along the ground surface to measure the propagating waves and are connected to a seismograph that records the data. Rayleigh waves are generated from seismic sources described to be active, passive, or a combination of both. For example, active sources can be generated sources from a sledge hammer striking a plate or other sources that are created near the traverse. Passive sources can be nearby highway traffic, construction equipment working in the distance, etc. Several recordings (typically 15 to 60+ seconds long) are captured and stored for later analysis. As multiple traverses are performed along the ground surface, the 1-D profiles can be compiled to generate a 2-D profile of the subsurface conditions. It is worth noting that since seismic traverses typically "average" conditions along the traverse length to some extent, the expectations and limitations of geophysical methods should be realized.

AN/APG-69

Emerson Electric's AN/APG-69 is an X band coherent pulse doppler radar originally designed for the F-20 Tigershark aircraft. Northrop skipped over the APG-69 in favor of the General Electric AN/APG-67 for the F-20 project, but the APG-69 was used by a number of other F-5 operators, and other light fighter projects like the ALR Piranha.
Unlike Emerson's earlier radars, the APG-69 offered a complete suite of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The air-to-air modes included velocity search for long-range wide-angle searches, track-while-scan, single target track and dogfight modes that locked onto the closest target. The APG-69 was capable of guiding the AIM-7 Sparrow missile, making it the first of Emerson's offerings to reach production with beyond visual range capability. The air-to-ground modes included Doppler-Beam Sharpening mapping, moving target search and track, and sea-surface-search modes.

ETen Chinese System

ETen Chinese System (倚天中文系統) was the most popular DOS-compatible traditional Chinese operating system before Chinese Windows 95.
DOS did not support Chinese characters, which are not in Extended ASCII. Many companies in Taiwan developed their own IBM PC compatible traditional Chinese operating system running on DOS, which were mutually incompatible between the OS, such as Kuo Chia (國喬) and Acer. 
The developer of the Eten OS, E-TEN, earned their early profits from sales of their hardware based plug-in card based Chinese system products. Their software (only) Chinese systems were widely copied by many traditional Chinese users and software pirates, but this was difficult for E-TEN to control. Most traditional Chinese products were compatible with the Eten OS at that time.
When Microsoft developed the Chinese Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, traditional Chinese software developer and users shifted to Windows from DOS. The last version of the Eten OS was a Chinese Windows-compatible version. The Eten and other traditional Chinese OS are now used in a few DOS based POS systems.

Parmanand Jha

Parmanand Jha () (born 1944) is a Nepali politician who had been Vice President of Nepal 2008-2009, and again 2010 to the present. Previously he served as a Supreme Court judge. He was born and brought up in Darbhanga in Indian Mithila in Bihar, India, his mother's home - according to Hindu traditions, but on his father's side belongs to North Mithila, a subject of Nepal, and so a citizen of Nepal. Jha resigned as a judge in December 2007 after he was not proposed by the Judicial Council as a permanent judge at the apex court, following allegations of involvement in drug smuggling. Later, Jha joined political life and became a member of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, one of several organizations agitating against dominance of Nepal's politics, etc., by the minority hill population as against the Madhesias, a collection of plains countries ethnicities with Indophile tendencies espousing Hindi as their lingua franca. On 19 July 2008, he was elected as Vice-President of Nepal by the Constituent Assembly.
He began his first term of office as Vice-President of Nepal on 23 July 2008 by taking the Oath of Office from President Ram Baran Yadav at the Sheetal Niwas Presidential Palace in Hindi in the presence of Prime Minister Girijaprasad Koirala and others.
Hindi Oath Controversy.
Jha's legitimacy as Vice-President was challenged and controverted for taking the Oath of Office in Hindi, by Gorkha and other Hill ethnicities that have dominated Nepal's politics since the Gorkhas formed Nepal. Jha's mother tongue is Maithili but he is also fluent in Hindi, Bengali, Nepali and English.
A writ petition was filed by Advocate Balkrishna Neupane at the apex court claiming that the oath was unconstitutional as it was taken in a language not recognized by the interim constitution. After a year long court procedure, the Supreme Court on 24 July 2009 ordered Jha to retake the oath of office and secrecy for the second time "in accordance with the Constitution," ruling that taking oath in Hindi was not constitutional.
However, Jha objected to the Supreme Court verdict, accusing the court of being biased and of conflict of interests. He stated that he would decide whether or not to retake the oath after consulting political parties and the "people he represents," i.e., the Madhesias who principally speak Bhojpuri, Maithili and other plains languages and who consider Hindi their de facto "national language," and demanded changes to the law to ensure that all languages (i.e., Hindi) "are given due respect." 
The Supreme Court's deadline for retaking the oath expired on 30 August 2009. As Jha did not swear once again the Oath of Office, the office was considered to have become vacant from August 31, 2009. In order to maintain political and ethnic inclusivity, the Nepalese government did not seek a new Vice-President but continued to work with Jha towards a compromise, seeking to re-instate him. Changes were made to the law to allow the Oath of Office to be taken in native ethnic languages, e.g., Jha's native Maithili, and on February 7, 2010, he accordingly took a fresh Oath of Office as Vice-President in the Maithili language.

Afghanistan–Canada relations

Afghanistan–Canada relations are relations between Afghanistan and Canada.
The Canadian government announced in February 2009 that it was adding Afghanistan to its list of preferred countries to receive foreign aid. This list includes 18 countries and the West Bank and Caribbean region.
History.
Beginning.
Official relations between Afghanistan and Canada did not occur immediately, but developed over time. Canadians involvement in Afghanistan dates back to the 1960s, with the creation of the first Canadian development assistance program to Afghanistan. As the need for greater coordination of efforts by development agencies working there grew, Ottawa decided to establish full diplomatic relations with Afghanistan in 1968.
In 1971, Canadian aid to Afghanistan included 257 000 bushels of wheat, where drought had reduced production of cereal crops.
Soviet war in Afghanistan.
The Soviet war in Afghanistan in 1979 and the installation of an undemocratic regime in Afghanistan led Canada to sever diplomatic ties. Even after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 the two countries did not re-establish full diplomatic relations, and contact was minimal despite humanitarian aid efforts by Canada in the 1990s.
Taliban period.
The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996. Canada became an outspoken critic of the Taliban's human rights abuses against the citizens of Afghanistan. Canada continued to provide humanitarian aid to the country despite Taliban restrictions on aid agencies.
War in Afghanistan.
The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks prompted Canada to re-evaluate its polices toward Afghanistan. The Minister of National Defence Art Eggleton authorized more than 100 Canadian Forces members serving on military exchange programs in the United States and other countries to participate in the War in Afghanistan. Although Canada did not participate in the opening days of the war, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced on October 7 that Canada would contribute forces to the international force being formed to conduct a campaign against terrorism. General Ray Henault, the Chief of the Defence Staff, issued preliminary orders to several CF units, as Operation Apollo was established. The Canadian commitment was originally planned to last to October 2003.
Canada re-established diplomatic relations with Afghanistan on January 25, 2002.
Diplomatic relationships.
Canada has an embassy in Kabul. In July 2009, an agreement on handing over of eight acre land by the Afghan government to Canadian embassy was signed in Kabul by the Afghan Minster of Foreign Affairs (Rangeen Dadfar Spanta) and the Canadian ambassador (Ron Hoffmann). The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has an embassy in Ottawa and a consulate in Toronto. The current Canadian ambassador is Glenn V. Davidson. Afghan ambassador Jawed Ludin. completed his assignment in Ottawa in December 2010 and was filled by Barna Karimi in March 2012.

Henk van der Kroon

Hendrikus Ferdinandus Maria van der Kroon (born March 4, 1942, in Amsterdam) is the founder and president of the Federation of European Carnival Cities (FECC).
FECC involvement.
The FECC is an international carnival association with over 500 members representing Carnival organizations in 52 countries with members from Eastern and Western Europe, America, Africa and the Caribbean isles. Since 1980, President van der Kroon has been a tireless missionary, traveling the world, bringing with him a plethora of knowledge regarding the history and tradition of global Carnivals. Throughout the year Henry van der Kroon and other board members travel to member cities6 and local Carnivals to learn, educate and often officiate at ceremonies and special events. Many Carnivals have grown and benefited from the mentorship of FECC. President van Der Kroon has been featured as a diplomatic star in over 300 parades. He draws cheering crowds with his large rotund physique, booming voice and regal demeanor. His uniform features a tuxedo and a most impressive tall, white and blue cock hat and numerous colorful medals hanging from his neck. Conventions and Celebrations FECC organizes two events annually. During springtime (May or June) a one week International Convention is held. All members are invited to a forum which enables them to promote their carnival and their city at seminars and workshops.
As chairman, Henry van der Kroon presides over the general assembly at each annual convention which began with Patras Carnival in 1981. A gala dinner is held at the beginning of each Convention. During the Opening Ceremony Mr. van der Kroon presents a specially minted medallion of the annual International Carnival capital city to each participant. A particular highlight of the convention is the award of special medallions of merit to individuals whose efforts have been exceptional in making the local Carnaval, Congress or organization succeed in their goals. "Everyone can still take part, create a fantasy - and follow their dreams." he has said, but creating the chemistry of great Carnaval takes special efforts which should be recognized. 
During autumn a less formal event called "Gala Dies Natalis" (annual birthday celebration) takes place in October. This is an exclusive gathering for members that is a celebration rather than a meeting. These events are always hosted by different member countries. A unique and charismatic individual, Henry van der Kroon is gregarious at one moment and serious the next. He has delivered the message of Carnaval to the world and garnered the necessary support of elected officials to preserve carnival traditions. The songs, stories, dances, floats and costumes passed on by many generations are best preserved as living traditions. The annual Carnival celebration is highlighted with a grand parade.
Future initiatives.
Among FECC President van der Kroon's boldest initiative is a bottom up initiative to bridge the gap and cooperate with the Arab world through the organization of festivals and carnivals. "Carnival is not about jokes but about heritage." he told a group of Maltese officials preparing to host the 25th Silver Anniversary of the organization in 2005. "If ideologies fail to create a better world the cultural and the human sense can bring people closer and push away conflicts between civilization and religions." the FECC President told dignitaries and the people as he unveiled the third FECC monument in as many years at the 2007 Sousee, Tunisia Opening Ceremonies which was the first FECC International Carnival City Congress to held in an Arab and African country.
