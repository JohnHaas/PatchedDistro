1946 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race

The 1946 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was the second annual running of the "blue water classic" Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. It was hosted by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia based in Sydney, New South Wales. 
The inaugural race in 1945 had been planned as a cruise, and no thoughts were given to repeating the event. However it became a race at the suggestion of visiting Royal Navy captain John Illingworth, and the race proved so popular a repeat was planned.
The second race began on Sydney Harbour, at noon on Boxing Day (26 December 1946), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170 km) through the Tasman Sea, past Bass Strait, into Storm Bay and up the Derwent River, to cross the finish line in Hobart, Tasmania.
The 1946 expanded fleet comprised more than double the vessels of the inaugural event with19 starters. Of the 19 starters, 8 yachts were forced to retire, and the remaining 11 made it successfully to Hobart, with "Morna" captained by Claude Plowman winning line honours, and "Christina" captained by JR Bull took handicap honours on adjusted time.

Alex Lithgow

Alexander Frame Lithgow (1 December 1870 in Glasgow – 12 July 1929 in Launceston, Tasmania) was a Scottish-born, New Zealand and Australian based composer and bandleader known as the "Sousa of the Antipodes".
His name is pronounced "Alek" by his family.
Youth.
In 1876, the Lithgows emigrated to Invercargill, New Zealand aged 6. 
Alex went to Invercargill Grammar School (now Invercargill Middle School). 
He attended Invercargill's Presbyterian Church, First Church.
He liked Ice Hockey, the Circus and Rugby.
His family was musical, performing as the six-member Lithgow Concert Company around Southland.
1881 At the age of 11 having had lessons on the cornet initially by his father, Alex joined the local brass band the Invercargill Garrison Band. Alex also learnt the violin to a very high standard.
1886 At the age of 16 he advanced to be the band's solo and principal cornetist. However despite often being stated, he never was this Band's conductor.
1887 At the age of 17 his first composition, 'Wairoa', was published. This was named after a ship at the band was playing on at the Invercargill estuary.
Early adulthood.
Alex played for the Star Rugby football club in Invercargill.
Alex played with the Theatre Royal orchestra as first violin. 
He won national solo cornet titles for the next few years.
1893 At the age of 23 he toured New Zealand as a professional soloist.
Move to Australia.
1894 Aged 24 he left New Zealand and moved to Australia where became conductor of the St Joseph's Total Abstinence Society Band in Launceston Tasmania. He earned his living as a compositor at "The Examiner" and the "Daily Telegraph".
1900 Alex aged 30 married Elizabeth Hill Telfer at a Presbyterian church at Launceston on 6 June.
1901 He came back briefly to New Zealand to conduct the Woolston Band at Christchurch where at a charity concert the band performed an entire concert of his compositions.
1903 He went back to Launceston St Joseph's Band.
1904 At the age 34 he started the Australian Army's 12th Battalion Launceston Regiment Band.
1909 He spent his time conducting and being a spontaneous composer for the silent film orchestra at the Lyceum and Princess Theatres.
The 'Invercargill March'.
1909 At the age of 39 his celebrated quick march, The 'Invercargill March' was handed over to the city of Invercargill. 
The 'Invercargill March' link will explain the origin of the tune, how the tune became famous, an update on the centenary of the tune and the official Lyrics.
Later life.
1922 He returned to the St Joseph's band for the last time.
1923 He founded and conducted the Launceston Concert Orchestra where he presented many of his compositions plus symphonic jazz. There were more charity all-Lithgow compositions concerts.
1927 At the age of 57 he retired from work and the Band due to ill health.
His marches were published throughout the world and the Americans acclaimed him as 'the Sousa of the Antipodes'. Lithgow produced approximately two hundred marches, as well as numerous pieces for band, orchestra, piano and voice. He acquired no copyrights and many of his pieces, in his immaculate notation, were lost or unpublished. Music dominated his existence, but time for composing was scarce when after a long day's work he cycled home to change for an evening performance or a musical gathering.
12-7-1929 At the age of 59 a few months short of his 60th birthday Lithgow died of a Stroke at Launceston. At his funeral massed bands played The 'Invercargill'. He is buried in Carr Villa cemetery. He was survived by his wife, son and two daughters. One of the daughters Pat Ward wrote a book on him. In 1953 a memorial plaque was unveiled at Paterson Street Barracks and a Band Rotunda built in City Park, Launceston. Still today in Tasmania they continue with Lithgow-only concerts. Tasmanians regard him as theirs but to Kiwis he is from Invercargill.
Lithgow wrote the 'Galvini March' in tribute to his patron B. Galvin, an Australian construction and manufacturing magnate who was a pallbearer at his funeral.

I Hear Talk (song)

"I Hear Talk" is a 1984 single by UK pop group Bucks Fizz. It was written by Andy Hill and Peter Sinfield - the team responsible for the group's biggest hit in the UK, "The Land of Make Believe". It was also produced by Hill. Released as a single in December 1984, it is the title track from the group's fourth studio album. In 2010, this song was chosen to be the first single by The Original Bucks Fizz in a live jazz-style reworking.
Background.
Released on 15 December 1984, the single coincided with a much-publicised coach crash the group experienced earlier in the week. While the group were returning from a gig in Newcastle, their tour bus collided with road works and careened off the road and injured the members of the group as well their entourage. Member Mike Nolan was badly injured and the group were inactive for several months. As a result of this, promotion for the single was minimal and the song failed to chart as highly as had been expected, reaching No.34 in the UK Charts, despite it being seen as one of their strongest ever songs by fans. Reviewing the single for "Number One" magazine, pop group Bananarama made positive comments about the song, saying that it had "something that their last few singles didn't". Member Cheryl Baker has also commented that it is one of her favourite Bucks Fizz songs.
The song's lyrics centre on a man's jealousy within his relationship, after hearing rumours that his partner has been cheating on him. The lead vocalist for the song is member Bobby G, while the middle 8 section is performed by Cheryl Baker alone. The B-side of the single, "Pulling Me Under" was written and performed solely by Bobby G, while an extra track on the 12" single, "Invisible" featured member Jay Aston on lead. This latter song was a planned single for the group back in 1983, but was replaced at short notice by "London Town". It featured here in a remixed form, although the original was later released on the compilation, "The Lost Masters" in 2006. The song was co-written by Mike Batt, the only song Bucks Fizz recorded of his. 
"I Hear Talk" in a slightly different mix, was featured on the group's album of the same name, released a month earlier. A 12" version of the song was also released. The single cover featured the same photograph as the album, but against a white background rather than black. A limited-edition poster calendar for 1985 was included as well. Over the next two years, the song became a popular Club hit and featured on the Billboard Club Charts - the group's only American success. Due to this renewed interest in the song, another remix was featured on the group's 1986 album "Writing on the Wall". In the 2000s, a new version of the song mixed with added vocals by later member Shelley Preston. This version was eventually released on the 2013 compilation "The Best of The Lost Masters and More!". Journalist Mark Frith complimented the song labelling it "euphoric" and saying that it deserved to reach No.1.
The song was later covered and released as a single by girl-group Teen Dream, but failed to chart.
On 24 May 2010, The Original Bucks Fizz released a jazz-style reworking of "I Hear Talk" as their debut single. The song was performed on their 2009 tour in this style. The new arrangement was devised by Cheryl Baker's husband, Steve Stroud, who also plays bass on the track. A promotional video of the group performing on tour was also compiled for the release.

Biotic index

Biotic Index (also called "Family Biotic Index") is a scale for showing the quality of an environment by indicating the types of organisms present in it. It is often used to assess the quality of water in rivers. It is measured from 1 to 10 and corresponds to the four basic water quality (Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor). The concept of the Biotic Index was developed by William M. Beck in an effort to provide a simple measurement of stream pollution and its effects on the biology of the stream
To assign a biotic index value to a specific water site, the tester first collects macroinvertebrates from portions of the sample area of the stream, river or lake and separate them into groups of similar-looking organisms. More extensive testing can be done by looking for certain microscopic organisms.
Then an identification key is used to help determine which category or group the organism belongs in and allows a numerical value be assigned to that organism. A worksheet is then used to calculate the final value or score of all the organisms found. Depending upon the worksheet's equations, the score determines the condition of the water quality.
Usefulness of macroinvertebrates.
Aquatic macroinvertebrates have some general characteristics that make them very useful to assess stream health.
1. They are abundant and found in water bodies throughout the world.
2. They are not extremely mobile.
3. They carry out part or all of their life cycle within the stream or river.
Macroinvertebrates limited mobility and extended presence in the water means that they are exposed on a continuous basis to water quality in that stream or river. In particular, many of these organisms breath dissolved oxygen that is in the water. They are also easier to see at the time of sampling.
Not all the macroinvertebrates found in samples are listed on the biotic index scoring sheets. This is because some do not rely on oxygen within the water for survival. Many are able to collect air from the atmosphere and hold a bubble alongside their body to use like a scuba diver uses a tank of oxygen. 
For those macroinvertebrates that do rely on dissolved oxygen, some can only live in water that has a lot of oxygen. Others can live in water that doesn't have much oxygen dissolved in it at all. Generally, it is assume that the more pollution there is in the water, the less oxygen.
Classification.
The biotic index works by assigning different levels of tolerance to pollution to the different types of organisms. 
The types of macroinvertebrates and other organisms found during sampling are broken into 4 groups:
1: Pollution intolerant: These organisms are highly sensitive to pollution. (IE: Stonefly or Alderfly Larva)
2: Semi-Pollution intolerant: These organisms are sensitive to pollution. (IE: Dragonfly Larva or Crawfish)
3: Semi-Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in clean and slightly polluted waterways. (IE: Snails or Black Fly Larva)
4: Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in polluted, as well as clean aquatic ecosystems (IE: Leechs,Bloodworms)
Some index worksheets combine groups 2 and 3 together giving only 3 groups. Each group has a number assigned to it and is multiplied by the number of organisms found in that group. This is why identifying the type of organism is important.

Balard shooting range

During the Second World War, the Balard shooting range ("stand de tir de Balard") was the site of Nazi torture and executions, now disappeared with the construction of the Boulevard périphérique de Paris.
Location.
It was situated on the training area at Issy-les-Moulineaux (now situated with Paris in the 15e arrondissement). The Air Ministry now occupies the site, and it also forms part of the parc Suzanne Lenglen situated on the old héliport de Paris, opened in 1957. It was bounded by the quai d’Issy, the boulevard Victor, the rue de la porte d’Issy in Paris 15ème, and by the rue Jeanne d’Arc, the rue Guynemer, the boulevard Gambetta and the boulevard Gallieni in Issy-les-Moulineaux. It was here that the first French attempts at powered flight occurred in 1905, which in 1911 accidentally killed Maurice Berteaux, minister for war.
History.
200m and 50m firing ranges were created here in 1938 for police training, and taken over by the German Geheime Feld Polizei (GFP) after the defeat of France in the 1940 Battle of France.
Malgré un secret total de la part des nazis, des « signes » avaient traversé le champ de manœuvre et fin août 1944 des curieux vont en reconnaissance vers le ministère de l’Air, qui était occupé par la Luftwaffe depuis juin 1940. 
Parmi ces curieux, le commissaire de police Henri Danty et le photographe Roger Schall qui vont découvrir l’horreur du stand de 50 mètres (rapport du commissaire Henri Danty): 
Ce lieu tragique a disparu le 24 juin 1964, lors de travaux de construction d’un bâtiment administratif et de logements pour les troupes.
Le mur d’amiante.
La construction du mur d’amiante témoigne d’une parfaite connaissance de ses caractéristiques. L’amiante est incombustible. On peut le chauffer à l’infini sans qu’il fonde.On suppose que des câbles électriques traversaient le mur et alimentaient des résistances chauffant le mur à de très hautes températures. Les résistants qui tombaient sur le mur y laissaient leur vie mais également l’empreinte de leurs mains.--->
Victims.
The first massacre occurred on 6 July 1942, with the Kommando für Kapital Verbrechen charged with "managing" the firing range, on the orders of Karl Oberg, chief of SS and police. 143 people were tortured then shot here, including :
A plaque commemorating the names of the 143 people executed here was unveiled on 23 April 1961 on the wall of the air ministry (BA 117) on the range's exact site.

Weather.
The average annual temperature is 21 °C, the highest reaches 38 °C and the minimum 0 °C. The highest annual amount of the country in rainfall occurs in the region of Alto Paraná.
Animals and Plants.
The Municipal Park Monday includes a natural reserve of nine hectares covered by a thick vegetation, rich with diverse species of flora and fauna and is one of the last remaining blocks of the Atlantic Forest west from Paraná River. 
Hydrography.
The Monday River empties into the Paraná River, has a variable flow depending on the seasons of rain, while at the top of the jump, the most risky can swim in its cool waters, with countless small falls and whirlpool jets that serve as natural . Also, with extreme caution, you can practice canoeing. 
At dawn or at dusk, the rumor produced by the waters that fall on the black basalt stone can be heard at great distances, like the mist that rose on strong clash between the vital liquid and rocks.
Tourism.
In Presidente Franco District, nature gives the region a show over the waters, the imposing Monday Falls, form a remarkable natural spectacle that has a long history, it was one of the stations in the path of the pre-Hispanic Guarani. 
The waterfall is more than 40 meters high and consists of three main falls with other minors who rushed up near the mouth of the River Monday, one of the major tributaries of the right bank of the Parana River. 
It is a beautiful spectacle that foams with their yellow and white steam caused by the impact of water with rocks and bushes that surround the vast depression Monday River can be viewed from a system of walkways and viewpoints in a beautiful and well cared Natural Park. 
The park is used by tourists in the region for picnics, hikes and camps, trails in the midst of vegetation take visitors up viewpoints and walkways where you can contemplate the depression 40 meters from the river. 
To those who like adventure, rocky cliffs favor the practice of climbing and rappelling alongside the water, hiking trails that cut through the park and go up the banks of the river. The attraction is inside the City Park Monday Jumps River, which provides space for camping and meals.
How to get there.
You get to the park taking the highway that links Saltos del Guairá Presidente Franco. When you reach the viaduct km 4 Ciudad del Este takes southward. A 10 km south to his right hand, displayed a poster showing the path of entry into the jumps.

Richard Aldridge was a British palaeontologist, Bennett Professor of geology at the University of Leicester.
Aldridge's career began at Southampton University before moving to a temporary lectureship at University College London and then to Nottingham University where he remained until 1989 when, during the Oxburgh Review of Earth Sciences, he moved to his current institution, the University of Leicester, where he served two terms as Head of Department. Aldridge's research has been focused primarily on the conodont biostratigraphy and palaeobiology and one of his seminal contributions has been to uncover the vertebrate nature of the long-enigmatic conodont animal, principally in collaboration with Derek Briggs and Euan Clarkson. This was achieved through careful analysis of skeletal remains, but also through analysis of rare soft tissue remains of conodonts. This led naturally to Aldridge's current research focus which is fossil Lagerstätten. Aldridge was awarded the Pander Medal of the Pander society in 2006. He is currently President of the Palaeontological Association.

Mark Purnell

Dr Mark Andrew Purnell is a British palaeontologist, Reader of Geology at the University of Leicester.
Purnell is an expert in conodont biostratigraphy (principally Carboniferous) and conodont palaeobiology, focussing especially on attempts to uncover the function of conodont elements. Using conventional functional morphology, physical modelling and microwear analysis, Purnell uncovered unequivocal evidence that conodont elements had performed a mechanical tooth function in life, resolving a palaeobiological debate that had run for more than a century. His work has expanded in recent years to analysing feeding mechanisms of extinct vertebrates more generally, exploiting microwear, including validation studies based on extant stickleback fish.
Purnell was awarded the Hinde Medal of the Pander society in 2006 and served as Vice-President of the Palaeontological Association from 2003-2005.
In 2009, Purnell conducted a study into the chewing methods and diet of hadrosaurids, a herbivore species of duck-billed dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous period. The study, which Purnell co-authored with paleontologist Paul Barrett and graduate student Vince Williams, was published on June 30, 2009 in the journal, "The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences". By analyzing hundreds of microscopic scratches on the teeth of a fossilized "Edmontosaurus" jaw, the team determined hadrosaurs had a unique way of eating unlike any creature living today. In contrast to a flexible lower jaw joint prevalent in today's mammals, hadrosaurs had a unique hinge between the upper jaws and the rest of its skull. The team found the dinosaur's upper jaws pushed outwards and sideways while chewing, as the lower jaw slid against the upper teeth. The study also found that hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs. However, Purnell said these conclusions were less secure than the more conclusive evidence regarding the motion of teeth while chewing.

The program is broadcast live (in the eastern states) on ABC1 and online, in front of a studio audience. From October 2010, "Q&A" is also simulcast live on ABC News 24, allowing it to be viewed live across the country.
The program is broadcast from the ABC's studios in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo. Anyone wishing to be in the audience can fill in a form on the program's website, which as well as asking for contact details, asks some questions relating to the applicant's political views to help "select a diverse and well-balanced audience". "Q&A" is occasionally broadcast from other cities.

Gaspar da Costa

Gaspar da Costa (d. Penfui, West Timor, 9 November 1749) was the leader or "tenente general" (lieutenant general) of the Portuguese-speaking Topasses, a Eurasian group that dominated much of the politics on Timor in the early modern period. He was largely responsible for the dramatic collapse of Portuguese power in West Timor, a process that laid the foundations for the modern division of Timor in an Indonesian and an independent part.
Political rise.
His exact parentage is not known, but he might have been the son of the former tenente general Domingos da Costa (d. 1722). He appeared as tenente general in 1732, shortly after the conclusion of a treaty between the Topasses and the official Portuguese governor of Timor. There had been a state of intermittent warfare between the two Portuguese fractions since 1702, but during the time of Gaspar da Costa there was a lull in the hostilities. He supported the foundation of a priest seminar on Timor, but at the same time dominated large parts of Timor without caring about the governor. His main seat of residence was Animata in the present Oecussi-Ambeno enclave, close to Lifau at the north coast, where the governor resided. Animata was described as an extensive settlement with circa 1,800 houses.
The son of Gaspar da Costa.
In 1748 Gaspar da Costa sent his eldest son Baltazar together with a Dominican priest to France for educational purpose. In the next year the boy and his preceptor arrived to Lorient in France. The priest, however, disappeared with the goods and left Baltazar to fend for himself. The latter pursued the rest of his life as a ship's cook and a humble relief-seeker. His plight was noted by some French persons of standing, who presented him to the public as the "Prince of Timor", but Baltazar eventually died poor and forgotten, some time after 1778.
The Battle of Penfui.
Gaspar da Costa's relations with the Dutch colonizers in Kupang in westernmost Timor were generally poor. In 1735 a Topass army seriously threatened Kupang, and in 1746-49 the Topasses intervened on the Island of Roti, a Dutch dependency close to Timor. In 1748 a number of Timorese princedoms in West Timor, who were usually clients to the Portuguese, turned rebellious against Gaspar da Costa. As the Topass forces fought back, lots of Timorese refugees headed for Kupang and the Dutch, who sympathized with the rebels. Especially, the ruler of the prestigious Sonbai princedom joined the Dutch with the bulk of his followers. Gaspar da Costa raised a comprehensive army consisting of Topasses and levies from the various Timorese princedoms still under his control. The Dutch calculated it to be 20,000 men or even more. The professed aim of Gaspar da Costa was to bring the fugitives back and to eliminate the Dutch garrison in Kupang.
The Topass-Timorese army camped at Penfui, at present-day El Tari Airport east of Kupang, where they made fortifications of stone and earth. On 9 November 1749 the Dutch sent out a multi-ethnic force consisting of Europeans, Solorese, Sawunese, Rotinese, mardijkers (non-whites in Dutch service), Timorese, etc. In the ensuing Battle of Penfui they attacked the fortifications of Gaspar da Costa with success. The weakness of his large but non-uniform army became apparent as big contingents fled the field in the beginning of the battle. When Gaspar da Costa attempted to leave the battlefield on horseback he was pierced by a Timorese spear, while his followers were slaughtered in the thousands. The Topass defeat meant that the Dutch were able to extend their sphere of influence to most of West Timor during the following decade. In this way the battle laid the ground for the colonial division of Timor in two halves, which was permanented in the nineteenth century, with consequences until today.

History.
After serving in the First World War, Cliff Schaten returned to Cincinnati, Ohio and started an art studio named C. H. Schaten Studios in 1919. The company grew to be one of the largest art studios in the area, and in 1959, seven of its employees purchased the company, renaming it Studio Art Associates. During the 1960s and 1970s, the company—renamed Cato Johnson—extended its global reach with offices in London, Brussels, Geneva, Paris, New York, and Toronto. In 1975, Cato Johnson was acquired by the advertising firm Young & Rubicam (Y&R), which continued to expand locations, spreading into San Francisco, Hong Kong, São Paulo, and Mexico City. In 1983, five Y&R shareholders—Mort Libby, Ray Perszyk, Jerry Kathman, Howard McIlvain and Jim Gabel—organized a leveraged purchase of the Cincinnati office, which had established close working relationships with Cincinnati-headquartered Procter & Gamble and other consumer goods clientele. LPK emerged from this buyout.

XAML Browser Applications

XAML Browser Applications (XBAP, pronounced "ex-bap") are Windows Presentation Foundation (.xbap) applications that are hosted and run inside a web browser such as Firefox or Internet Explorer. Hosted applications run in a partial trust sandbox environment and are not given full access to the computer's resources like opening a new network connection or saving a file to the computer disk and not all WPF functionality is available. The hosted environment is intended to protect the computer from malicious applications; however it can also run in full trust mode by the client changing the permission. Starting an XBAP from an HTML page is seamless (there is no security or installation prompt). Although one perceives the application running in the browser, it actually runs in an out-of-process executable (PresentationHost.exe) managed by a virtual machine. In the initial release of .NET Framework 3.0, XBAPs only ran in Internet Explorer. With the release of .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 which includes an XBAP extension, they also run in Mozilla Firefox. 
XBAP limitations.
XBAP applications have certain restrictions on what .NET features they can use. Since they run in partial trust, they are restricted to the same set of permission granted to any InternetZone application. However 99% of standard WPF functionality is available to an XBAP application. Therefore most of the WPF UI features are available.

Wedding Central

Wedding Central was an American digital cable television channel that focused on programming involving brides and weddings, which was a spin-off of the programming which made up much of WE tv's schedule at the network's launch on August 18, 2009. The network was launched by the Rainbow Media subsidiary of Cablevision. Much of the network's programming was taken from previously aired WE tv wedding programming and wedding-related motion pictures, with little new content offered outside of promotions and on-screen quizzes. Also offered solely on Cablevision systems was interactive television components such as quizzes, polls, voting, and advertising opportunities for national and local wedding retailers.
Unlike WE tv, which was a successful spin-off of AMC itself in 1997, the network had only limited distribution, only being carried on the systems of Cablevision, a limited amount of Time Warner Cable systems, and Mediacom. When Cablevision spun-off Rainbow Media into a separate public company known as AMC Networks via an initial public offering on July 1, 2011, the new company closed Wedding Central on the same day. Wedding-related programming returned to have a focus on WE tv, and Wedding Central's website now redirects to WE tv's weddings section.

Pukwudgie

A Pukwudgie is a being from the Wampanoag folklore. Pukwudgies' features resemble those of a human, but with enlarged noses, fingers and ears. Their skin is described as being a smooth grey, and at times has been known to glow.
In Native American lore, Pukwudgies have the following traits and abilities;
Native Americans believed that Pukwudgies were best left alone. When you see a Pukwudgie you are not supposed to mess with them, or they will repay you by playing nasty tricks on you, or by following you and causing trouble. They were once friendly to humans, but then turned against them. They are known to kidnap people, push them off cliffs, attack their victims with short knives and spears, and to use sand to blind their victims.
Origin in legend.
"Legends of the Pukwudgie began in connection to 'Maushop', a creation giant believed by the Wampanoag to have created most of Cape Cod. He was beloved by the people, and the Pukwudgies were jealous of the affection the Natives had for him. They tried to help the Wampanoag, but their efforts always backfired, until they eventually decided to torment them instead. They became mischievous and aggravated the Natives until they asked 'Granny Squanit', Maushop’s wife, for help. Maushop collected as many as he could. He shook them until they were confused and tossed them around New England. Some died, but others landed, regained their minds and made their way back to Massachusetts.
Satisfied he had done his job and pleased his wife, Maushop went away for a while. In his absence, the Pukwudgies had returned. They again changed their relationship with the Wampanoags. They were no longer just a nuisance, but began kidnapping children, burning villages and forcing the Wampanoag deep into the woods and killing them. Squanit again stepped in, but Maushop, being very lazy, sent his five sons to fix the problem. The Pukwudgies lured them into deep grass and shot them dead with magic arrows. Enraged, Squanit and Maushop attacked as many as they could find and crushed them, but many escaped and scattered throughout New England again. The Pukwudgies regrouped and tricked Maushop into the water and shot him with their arrows. Some legends say they killed him, while others claim he became discouraged and depressed about the death of his sons, but after these events Maushop disappears from the Wampanoags' mythology."
Recent history.
Pukwudgie encounters have been reported in the Freetown-Fall River State Forest in Massachusetts, which includes the Watuppa Reservation, which belongs to the Wampanoag Nation. Several unexplained suicides at a ledge in the state forest have been linked by some to the Pukwudgie lore of pushing people off cliffs.
Mounds State Park in Anderson, Indiana is a hotspot for Pukwudgie activity.
Round Rock's Hairy Man Festival is based on a human boy who grew into a wild hermit. After his death, he vengefully haunted Hairy Man Road. Some locals claim that he summoned a troll, using old Nordic Runes to help him; it is that troll who resides on Hairy Man Road, still there after the hermit's death. He causes accidents and misfortune to those who dare travel Hairy Man Road by bicycle at night.

Common Ground (NYC)

Common Ground is a nonprofit social services organization in New York City whose goal is to create high-quality permanent and transitional housing for the homeless. Its philosophy holds that supportive housing costs substantially less than homeless shelters — and many times less than jail cells or hospital rooms, and that people with psychiatric and other problems can better manage them once they are permanently housed and provided with services. Since its foundation in 1990 by Rosanne Haggerty, the organization has created more than 5,000 units of housing for the homeless. "This is about creating a small town, rather than just a building," according to Haggerty. "It's about a real mixed society, working with many different people."
Programs.
Street to Home.
Among Common Ground's activities is documenting the homeless population and then trying to persuade those who spend the most time on the streets to seek permanent housing, even if they still have drug, alcohol or medical problems. Some of those involved in the issue of homelessness consider Common Ground a pioneer in this approach in the United States.
However, the count, which has been adopted by the city for use in other areas, is not an end to itself, but a first step. According to Becky Kanis, the former Director of Common Ground's "Innovations Department",
The important part is what we do with this information. We want to move from crisis management to lasting solutions. Other cities have done that successfully. We plan to do the same... At the real end of the day the only thing that's going to matter is the people who have been thus far completely unwilling to accept the offers of shelter, etc. by outreach workers. Can we reach them and make a positive difference in their lives? What can we do compassionately to help these people who have, for all practical purposes, fallen through the cracks of society? That's where our focus is; that's what matters. ... We don't know exactly what's going to work here in New York, but we know what's worked in other cities. Therefore, we're going to spend our efforts doing those things, and as we find smarter and better ways to do things we will adopt them.
The Street to Home initiative is a partnership of Common Ground and the Times Square Alliance, and the strategy reduced homelessness by 87% over two years. It incorporates strategic targeting of individuals and intensive followup modeled on the successful approach used in the United Kingdom's Rough Sleepers Initiative. The Rough Sleepers Initiative achieved a 75% reduction in street homelessness across England and prompted deeper investment in homelessness from Parliament. In New York City, Street to Home has been adopted as a citywide strategy to reduce street homelessness by two-thirds within three years. Common Ground will direct all efforts on the streets of midtown Manhattan and throughout the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.
Common Ground's initial strategy was to deal with a 20-block neighborhood around Times Square with one of the highest levels of homelessness in the city, focusing on securing housing for those who have been living on the street the longest and need housing the most. They replaced the random "first come, first served" approach with a targeted, strategic process: identify and prioritize the most vulnerable individuals on the street, assess and negotiate housing options with those individuals, then house and retain.
Street to Home partners with Business Improvement District public safety officers or community outreach workers who – because they are on the front lines every day – have a thorough knowledge of the people continually living on their streets. They are trained by Common Ground in approaches to introduce clients to a housing team that will help them to secure housing. A simple tracking tool enables workers to differentiate between those who are consistently in the targeted area – called "anchors" – and those who are transients. The role of "anchor" individuals in street homelessness was identified in the Rough Sleepers Initiative, with subsequent targeting of those individuals yielding greater success – a tipping point – in engaging and moving individuals in the surrounding area. Common Ground developed a research-based Vulnerability Index to take the guesswork out of outreach and offer a rational system for prioritizing the most vulnerable homeless for housing.
Because most people who have lived on the streets for a long time are suffering from multiple disabilities and are usually eligible for some form of housing subsidy, Common Ground trains service providers in how to assess for eligibility for housing, services, and benefits, and provides tips on expediting this process. With the immediacy of the housing offer in hand for the individual, Street to Home uses techniques derived from Motivational Interviewing and Trauma Informed Care in working with clients to negotiate placement into housing. Street to Home assesses each individual's eligibility for subsidized housing and income benefits and walks each person through the process of obtaining permanent housing- registering for disability or income support benefits, completing medical and psychiatric tests, and finding an apartment that fits the person's needs.
Since the start of the Street to Home initiative, Common Ground has helped more than 175 adults – who had been homeless an average of 9.9 years – move from the streets directly into permanent housing, where more than 90% are able to maintain their housing. Most individuals who have lived on the streets for long periods do not wish to live in a shelter but want and are successful in their own homes, which begins their reintegration into society. Some clients of Street to Home have re-established relationships with family members. Many are working or have returned to school.
Foyer.
While on vacation in Ireland, Common Ground founder Rosanne Haggerty looked into how that country addresses the housing needs of its poorest residents. She found in the city of Belfast, the Foyer Program, a model long used in France, Ireland, and England to help young people without family and at risk of homelessness make the transition to adulthood. Haggerty hoped the model might be useful in New York City, where about 20 percent of homeless adults have a history of foster care, and where, according to one city agency, some 3,700 young people will age out of foster care between 2002 and 2004.
Haggerty decided to replicate the Foyer Program in her next project – the renovation of an old YMCA residence in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, which set aside 40 of its 207 units for young adults ages 18 to 24 who are aging out of foster and residential care or are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The Chelsea Residence (The Christopher) provides employment, educational mentoring and life-skills training programs; participants work over an 18-month to two-year period toward permanent housing and stable employment. The $32 million project, which includes $9 million for acquisition, has received state, city and private financing.
Foyers are a way "to help people who aren't ready to be on their own to develop the life skills, job skills and maturity to lead independent, successful lives," according to Sister Paulette LoMonaco, executive director of New York City's Good Shepherd Services.

Current residences.
As of March 2011 Common Ground has 12 buildings with 2,497 units.
The Times Square.
This 15-story art deco building has a lobby with vaulted ceilings and a marble staircase. Fifteen years ago, the Times Square Hotel was in a state of decay. Its ceilings were caving in, its halls were dark and dangerous, and its tenants were drug addicts, homeless families and elderly people with no place else to go.
A young college graduate named Rosanne Haggerty became obsessed with saving the run-down hotel at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street from the wrecker's ball and converting it into a home for street people, low-income workers and psychiatric survivors. Haggerty and other housing activists applied for every grant, tax credit and low-interest loan available, won the support of corporate and community leaders and sold Mayor David Dinkins on their vision.
In 1994, the restored Times Square Hotel emerged from its scaffolding, and is today the home to 652 residents. Supportive social services are provided by the Center for Urban and Community Services.
The Prince George.
For decades the Prince George Hotel, with its burnished wood, lavishly detailed ceilings and classical columns welcomed visitors to Edith Wharton's New York. But then the hotel declined, becoming one of New York's notorious welfare hotels of The Bowery (Manhattan) in the 1980s, when it housed about 1,600 people. The city closed it in 1989.
Today, the hotel on East 28th Street has reopened, combining aspects of both of its previous incarnations. It once again provides housing to the formerly homeless, but the number of residents is far less, and they are able to take advantage of supportive services right in the building. At the same time, the Prince George has been restored to its former glory in what now has become one of Manhattan's official historic districts, Madison Square North, with particular attention to its once-again elegant ballroom, a grand gathering place. Supportive social services are provided by the Center for Urban and Community Services.
Prince George Ballroom.
In 2004, Common Ground launched an ambitious project to restore the ballroom and adjacent former Hunt Room. The project presented an opportunity to offer needed training and jobs. Common Ground, working with four other non-profit groups, arranged for at-risk youth, high school students interested in restoration arts, architectural students, and individuals with HIV/AIDS to work on the renovation. Students at the Parsons School designed and built an entry foyer and gallery space in what had been the Hunt Room. Faced with an area that was beyond restoration, the students developed an airy, modern space that is now the World Monuments Fund Gallery, which serves as a special exhibition and events space.
The Christopher.
In 2000, the YMCA sold its second building for $9 million to Common Ground Community of Manhattan. The building, which is entered through 202 West 24th Street, once housed the Y's transient residences. In July 2000 the group began a $23 million transformation of the 24th Street building into 207 residences for homeless people and low-income single adults - those earning up to $32,640 a year - as well as teenagers at risk of becoming homeless. Supportive social services are provided by the Center for Urban and Community Services. 
The Andrews.
Common Ground Community purchased The Andrews, a dingy century-old building, in 2002 for $2.5 million. The renovation added three floors to accommodate 136 residential units and allow for a medical team to be housed on the premises. A transitional housing program, residents do not pay rent and case managers assist them in attaining permanent housing.
The Betty Ruth and Milton B. Hollander Foundation Center.
Common Ground renovated the property at 410 Asylum, known as The Capitol Building, and created 70 mixed-income apartments there, along with space for street-level retail businesses. The rehabilitation of the Hollander Foundation Center incorporates sustainable design elements that enhance energy efficiency and reduce the building's carbon footprint. Green elements include a high-efficiency heating system, low-flow fixtures, an energy-efficient lighting plan, EnergyStar appliances and plans for a green roof. Common Ground now incorporates green in all of its projects in Connecticut and New York.
NEF provided funding for the project through Common Ground's allocation of low-income housing tax credits and historic tax credits, both stemming from federal programs designed to encourage private-sector investment in affordable housing.
The upper floors of the former office building were converted into 70 affordable mixed-income apartments. The street level storefronts, comprising were also restored. About 80 percent of the apartments at the center are rented to those with incomes below 60 percent of the area's median income. Rents start at $765 per month. The remaining two-bedroom units will be rented at market rate, $1,400 per month.
Construction was completed in the summer of 2009.
The Lee.
In 2007, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), in cooperation with Common Ground began construction on a $59 million, supportive housing complex at 133 Pitt Street on the Lower East Side that will be Manhattan's first such LEED Silver development. Designed by Kiss + Cathcart Architects (Brooklyn Health House, Stillwell Avenue Subway Terminal), The Lee, named after one of the project's major financiers, will offer affordable housing and on-site social services for 263 residents. 104 units are reserved for the homeless, 105 are for low-income residents, and 54 units are for young adults that are at high risk for homelessness. Green design features include an efficient condensing boiler, a green roof, efficient water fixtures, high-performance lighting, and low-irrigation landscaping. HPD and Common Ground expect a minimum of twenty percent savings in utility expenses.
Montrose Veterans Residence.
Renovation of a vacant hospital building on the Montrose campus began November 27, the result of a partnership between the VA and Common Ground. By Fall 2008, the first phase of the project was completed accommodating 96 veterans.
The $700,000 renovation included asbestos removal, electrical and plumbing upgrades, a new fire-alarm system and architectural changes to create individual rooms and common rooms in the post-World War II-era building. Most residents are referred by the Montrose VA's Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans Program after a four-month rehabilitation program there. Others come from shelters and streets in New York City and Westchester County as well as veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who are facing imminent homelessness.
During their nine- to 12-month stays, veterans also receive support to find employment, manage their physical and mental health conditions, reconnect with family, and later move into their own apartment.
The Schermerhorn.
This eleven-story, 217-unit apartment building in Brooklyn's Boerum Hill neighborhood was completed in 2008. Units are for households earning under 60% of the area's median income, and half are reserved for the homeless or people with special needs. Schermerhorn House is surrounded by luxury condominiums and townhouses, so developers Common Ground and the Actors Fund knew good design was vital to winning local support. They interviewed top architects, and in a sign of growing interest in affordable housing, nearly all of them expressed interest. "I was even worried if they were going to take my call," says Nadine Maleh, Common Ground's director of design and construction. The developers chose Polshek Partnership, a New York firm known for high-profile projects such as the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the new planetarium building in New York's American Museum of Natural History. Polshek's design — which has a glass façade and a rooftop garden — is meant to fit in with the surrounding buildings. But the glass wall isn't just for looks: Due to site restrictions, part of the project had to be built atop a subway tunnel, a complex engineering challenge. Instead of making the north wall out of heavy masonry, the architects used textured glass, which is lighter and allowed for less costly support trusses. "Constraints can be challenging, but they can provide opportunity," says Polshek principal Susan Rodriguez. Polshek, like many prominent firms working in this field, charged a reduced fee.
Supportive social services are provided by the Center for Urban and Community Services and The Actors Fund.
Facilities under construction.
As of March 2011 Common Ground has 5 buildings with 554 under construction (only 371 units shown below).

Recursive ascent parser

In computer science, recursive ascent parsing is a technique for implementing an LALR parser which uses mutually-recursive functions rather than tables. Thus, the parser is "directly encoded" in the host language similar to recursive descent. Direct encoding usually yields a parser which is faster than its table-driven equivalent for the same reason that compilation is faster than interpretation. It is also (nominally) possible to hand edit a recursive ascent parser, whereas a tabular implementation is nigh unreadable to the average human.
Recursive ascent was first described by Thomas Penello in his article in 1986. He was not intending to create a hand-editable implementation of an LR parser, but rather a maintainable and efficient parser implemented in assembly language. The technique was later expounded upon by G.H. Roberts in 1988 as well as in an article by Leermakers, Augusteijn, Kruseman Aretz in 1992 in the journal "Theoretical Computer Science". An extremely readable description of the technique was written by Morell and Middleton in 2003. A good exposition can also be found in a TOPLAS article by Sperber and Thiemann.
Recursive ascent has also been merged with recursive descent, yielding a technique known as recursive ascent/descent. This implementation technique is arguably easier to hand-edit due to the reduction in states and fact that some of these states are more intuitively top-down rather than bottom up. It can also yield some minimal performance improvements over conventional recursive ascent.
Summary.
Intuitively, recursive ascent is a literal implementation of the LR parsing concept. Each function in the parser represents a single LR automaton state. Within each function, a multi-branch statement is used to select the appropriate action based on the current token popped off the input stack. Once the token has been identified, action is taken based on the state being encoded. There are two different fundamental actions which may be taken based on the token in question:
There is also a third LR automaton action which may be taken in a given state, but only after a reduce where the shift counter has decremented to zero (indicating that the current state should handle the result). This is the goto action, which is essentially a special case of shift designed to handle non-terminals in a production. This action must be handled "after" the multi-branch statement, since this is where any reduction results will "resurface" from farther down the call stack.
Example.
Consider the following grammar in bison syntax:
This grammar is LR(0) in that it is left-recursive (in the expr non-terminal) but does not require any lookahead. Recursive ascent is also capable of handling grammars which are LALR(1) in much the same way that table-driven parsers handle such cases (by pre-computing conflict resolutions based on possible lookahead).
The following is a Scala implementation of a recursive ascent parser based on the above grammar:

Antigua and Barbuda at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Antigua and Barbuda competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, submitting a delegation that included athletes Daniel Bailey, Brendan Christian, James Grayman, and Sonia Williams in track and field events, and Kareem Valentine in swimming. Antigua and Barbuda's appearance in Beijing marked its eighth appearance at the Summer Olympics since the nation's debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, Canada. There were no medalists from Antigua and Barbuda in 2008, although Bailey reached the quarterfinals and Christian the semifinals of their respective events.
Background.
Antigua and Barbuda participated in eight Olympic Games between its debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal and its 2008 appearance in Beijing, competing in every edition except for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The 2008 Summer Olympic delegation was smaller than those of 1980s and 1990s, when they were composed of thirteen or more athletes, but, with five participants, it was the same size that it had been at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. As of the conclusion of the Beijing Games, no Antiguan or Barbudan athlete has won a medal, although Brendan Christian progressed to semifinals and Daniel Bailey to quarterfinals of their respective events in 2008. At the 2008 games Kareem Valentine was the youngest athlete at fifteen years of age and Sonia Williams was the eldest at twenty-nine.
The Foreign Ministry of Antigua and Barbuda supported the Chinese handling of the civil unrest in Tibet, an issue marred in controversy due to self-immolations by Tibetans and numerous crackdowns on protesters, and expressed support for Chinese efforts to host the Olympics in Beijing despite the controversy. The flag-bearer for the Games was James Grayman, an Antiguan athlete.
Athletics.
Men's 100 meters.
Antigua Track Club athlete Daniel Everton "Bakka" Bailey competed in the men's 100 m dash on behalf of Antigua and Barbuda and was that year's only Antiguan to take part in the event. His participation in Beijing marked his second appearance in the Olympic games, following the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. In Beijing he was assigned to Heat 1 during the first round on August 14, competing against Usain Bolt of Jamaica and Vicente Lima of Brazil, among others. Bailey ran the event in 10.24 seconds, coming in second place in a heat of eight people, placing behind heat leader Bolt by 0.04 seconds and ahead of Lima by 0.02 seconds. Overall, in the first round, Bailey tied Trinidad and Tobago's Richard Thompson for tenth place out of eighty athletes.
Bailey advanced to the quarterfinals, which occurred later that day. Bailey was placed in Heat 5 against, among others, the United States' Walter Dix and Jamaica's Asafa Powell, completing the second round in 10.23 seconds. He ranked fourth out of eight in the event, falling behind Derrick Atkins of the Bahamas (3rd place with a time of 10.14 seconds) and ahead of Ghana's Aziz Zakari (5th place with a time of 10.24 seconds). Overall, Bailey tied Japan's Naoki Tsukahara for twentieth place out of forty remaining athletes and did not progress to semifinals.
Men's 200 meters.
Former University of Texas at Austin student Brendan Kyle Akeem Christian participated on behalf of Antigua and Barbuda in the 200 m dash at the Beijing Olympics. Christian, who broke the best American high school time in the 100 m and 200 m dashes, is the son of former Olympian Donald Christian, a cyclist for Antigua and Barbuda at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Brendan's participation marked his second Olympic appearance, having competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. In Beijing he raced in Heat 8 during the first round of the event on August 17. He ranked second place out of eight athletes, falling behind heat leader Aaron Armstrong of Trinidad and Tobago by 0.01 seconds and placing ahead of Canada's Jared Connaughton by 0.02 seconds. Overall, Christian tied Trinidad and Tobago's Rondell Sorillo and Japan's Shinji Takahira for ninth place out of sixty-six athletes.
The next day Christian participated in the quarterfinals and was placed in Heat 3 against athletes that included Churandy Martina of the Netherlands Antilles and Kristof Beyens of Belgium. Christian took first place in the race with a time of 20.26 seconds, beating second-place finalist Martina by 0.18 seconds and ranking second overall out of thirty-two athletes. Christian fell behind the overall quarterfinal leader Brian Dzingai of Zimbabwe by 0.03 seconds and defeated the United States' Walter Dix by 0.01 seconds. Christian advanced to semifinals, which took place on the same day.
Christian competed in Heat 2 against Usain Bolt of Jamaica, Shawn Crawford of the United States, and Kim Collins of Saint Kitts and Nevis, among others, and ranked fifth out of eight after running a time of 20.29 seconds. Collins ran 0.04 seconds faster than Christian, while Mauritius' Stephen Buckland ran 0.11 seconds slower. Christian did not advance to the final round.
Men's high jump.
James Grayman competed in the Beijing Olympics as Antigua and Barbuda's sole high jumper, where he participated in the second qualifying heat on August 17 against athletes that included Brazil's Jesse Lima and the Czech Republic's Tomas Janku. Grayman cleared a 2.20 meter height on his second attempt, placing behind tenth-place heat finalist Dmytro Dem'yanyuk of the Ukraine, who made the height on his first try, and eleventh-place heat finalist Linus Thörnblad of Sweden, who also made the height on his second attempt, but had fewer overall misses than Grayman. He finished ahead of the three thirteenth-place heat finalists (Italy's Alessandro Talotti, Spain's Javier Bermejo, and Botswana's Kabelo Kgosiemang) and the sixteenth-place heat finalist (Hup Wei Lee of Malaysia) who achieved the same height, but did so in three tries. Overall, Grayman ranked 28th out of 40 competitors and did not advance to finals on August 19.
Women's 100 meters.
Sonia Williams competed for Antigua and Barbuda in the women's 100 m dash and was the only female member of the Antiguan national delegation in Beijing. Her participation these Games marked her second Olympic appearance, her first having been at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In Beijing Williams participated in the first round of the event on August 15, when she was placed in Heat 5 against athletes that included Belgian Kim Gevaert and Belarusian Yuliya Nestsiarenka. She completed the race in 12.04 seconds, finishing sixth out of eight athletes. Guam's Cora Alicto, the seventh place finalist, ran 1.35 seconds slower than Williams, while the fifth place finalist, Chisato Fukushima of Japan, ran 0.3 seconds faster. Gevaert, who was the heat leader, earned a time that was 0.71 seconds faster than Williams'. Overall, Williams ranked 54th out of 85 athletes and did not progress to quarterfinals.
Swimming.
Fifteen-year old Kareem "Grinny" Valentine Sandoval was the only person to compete in a swimming event from Antigua and Barbuda in 2008. At the time he was in his third year in high school. He competed in the men's 50 m freestyle, taking part in the August 14 preliminaries. His participation in the event marked the fifth time that he had swum in a pool, as he usually practiced in the ocean. During the course of his event Valentine was placed in Heat 2 of 12 against swimmers that included Thepphithak Chindavong of Laos. Valentine swam the event in 31.23 seconds, ranking fifth among six competitors. Stany Kempompo Ngangola of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (6th) finished nearly four seconds behind him with a time of 35.19 seconds, while Chindavong led the heat with a time of 29.31 seconds. Overall, Valentine ranked 96th out of 97 swimmers in the event and did not advance to semifinals, which were held that same day.

You and Your Heart So Blue

"You and Your Heart So Blue" is a single by UK pop group Bucks Fizz. Released in June 1985, the song was written by Andy Hill and Peter Sinfield and was produced by Hill. This single was the last to feature member Jay Aston, who quit the group the same month.
Background.
The single release came at a traumatic time for the group. Having only just got over a coach crash, which had incapacitated the group for several months, the release date collided with member Jay Aston walking out of the band amid much publicity. Halfway through promoting the single, the group recruited a new female singer, Shelley Preston. As well as this, Bucks Fizz (with Aston) had recently filmed a TV special in Mauritius, but went unscreened as the production company had gone bankrupt midway through filming. The single became overshadowed in all the publicity and failed to reach the UK top 40, stalling at No.43, although is now considered by fans to be one of the group's best songs .
Despite the fact that Aston was still with the group at the time of release, the promotional video for the song only featured three members. This is most likely because the group's management knew she was leaving and decided to leave her out of the video, although they did some promotional TV work with her to support the song. The new line-up with Preston was premiered on the popular talk-show, "Wogan," where they elected to perform this song, although too late to revive its chart fortunes.
The picture cover of the 7" and 12" single didn't feature a photo of the group, possibly because the membership was in a state of flux, although a limited edition EP of the single did feature the group - with Aston (although she was noticeably separated from the other three). The B-side of the song was the earlier Bucks Fizz hit, "Now Those Days Are Gone", which was included to signify the recovery of member Mike Nolan, who was the most badly injured of the group in the coach crash. The 12" version of the single included a new song, "Evil Man" - a song solely written and performed by departing member Aston, while the EP included two previously unreleased tracks, "One Touch (Don't Mean Devotion)" and "Censored" - both tracks which had previously been recorded by writer Andy Hill's spin-off group, Paris. "You and Your Heart so Blue" was later included on the group's fifth studio album "Writing on the Wall", released in 1986.
An earlier version of "You and Your Heart So Blue" was uncovered during the making of the album "The Lost Masters" in 2006 and was included on the album in two different versions. This version was significantly different in that the lead vocals were sung by Cheryl Baker - rather than Bobby G as on the single version, and the song was completely different in tone, containing a light reggae beat in comparison to the heavy rock edge that the single had. Another alternate mix was featured on "The Lost Masters 2 - The Final Cut", released in 2008.
"You and Your Heart So Blue" was covered in 1992 by The Four Seasons

Magical (song)

"Magical" is a song written by John Parr and Meat Loaf and was released as a 1985 single by Parr. A few months later it was released in the UK as a single by pop group Bucks Fizz. It entered the charts by both artists in the US and UK respectively but was not a big hit for either.
John Parr version.
John Parr began working with Meat Loaf for the latter's 1984 album "Bad Attitude". Together they composed some songs, including "Magical", which became the opening track for Parr's debut album. Parr scored a US hit with the song "Naughty Naughty" in late 1984 and was followed up in April 1985 by "Magical" which entered the Billboard Hot 100 that month but stalled at No.73. It also reached No.28 on the Mainstream Rock chart. In Parr's native UK the single made no impression, although he did go on to achieve success a few months later with the song "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)", prompting his album to enter the UK charts. "Magical" remains the only (released) song written by Meat Loaf that he never recorded.
Bucks Fizz version.
Following the success of the rock-orientated track "Talking in Your Sleep", Bucks Fizz were keen to replicate it with the release of this similar-themed song. This was the heaviest sound the group ever adopted. With the public still familiar with their clean-cut pop image, the move was unsuccessful and "Magical" became the group's lowest charting single. Released in September 1985, the song reached No. 57 and spent only three weeks on the chart. 
The single was significant in that it was the first release with new member Shelley Preston, who had joined a few months earlier, although she didn't perform on the recording. It was also the group's last release with label RCA before their move to Polydor early the following year. Due to the failure of the single, plans for an album release at this time were shelved for a year. The song eventually featured on their fifth album "Writing on the Wall," released in 1986. An alternative edit of the song, featuring vocals by departed member Jay Aston was uncovered during production for the album "The Lost Masters 2 - The Final Cut". The song was included on the 2008 album. 
The B-side of the single was "Oh Suzanne", written by Warren Bacall. This song had been released two years previously on the group's "Greatest Hits" album. At the time of original release, it caused controversy within the group as it had featured lead vocals by Jay Aston, but they were removed and replaced by a lead vocal by other female member Cheryl Baker. Years later, Aston commented on the incident and was angered by the time and money that had been spent re-recording it. In 2006, this original version was uncovered and included on the compilation; "The Lost Masters", as well as an extended 12" version, hinting that it may have been considered for A-side release.

Pressure melting point

The pressure melting point is the temperature at which ice melts at a given pressure. As the pressure increases with depth in a glacier from the weight of the ice above, the melting temperature of ice decreases within bounds, shown in the diagram. This pressure melting point can reach values many degrees below 0°C.
Due to geothermal heat flux from below, the temperature at the same time increases. The level where ice can start melting is where the pressure melting point equals the actual temperature. In static equilibrium conditions, this would be the highest level where water can exist in a glacier. It would also be the level of the base of an ice shelf, or the ice-water interface of a subglacial lake.

The Lost Fleet

The Lost Fleet is a military science fiction series written by John G. Hemry under the pen name Jack Campbell. The series is set one-hundred-plus years into an interstellar war between two different human cultures, the Alliance and the Syndics. The protagonist of the story is discovered floating in a suspended animation escape pod one hundred years after he made a "heroic last stand" against an enemy fleet. In his absence, he has been made into a renowned hero in the Alliance, but his legend and actions are used to justify poor tactics and decisions. Awakened after being discovered during a secret mission that turns out to be an enemy trap, he is suddenly dropped into the role of fleet commander and expected to live up to the legend that has grown around him.
The series has ended with "Victorious" (2010). The author however plans to continue the "Lost Fleet" series with two spin-offs: "Beyond the Frontier", focusing on the main characters from the Lost Fleet, and "The Lost Stars", focusing on the Syndicate Worlds.
Plot summary.
The Lost Fleet.
The Alliance has been fighting the Syndicate Worlds for a century. The Alliance, however, has obtained a "hypernet key" from a Syndic traitor, allowing them to send a large fleet through a hypernet gate to directly attack the Syndic homeworld. This turns out to be a trap and the remnants of the Alliance fleet find themselves at the mercy of overwhelming Syndic forces.
During the approach to the Syndic homeworld, the fleet had discovered the escape pod of Captain John Geary in an abandoned star system. Known as "Black Jack" in the present, his legendary exploits are taught to every schoolchild and he is revered for his heroic last stand in the early days of the war. Awakened from hibernation, the posthumously-promoted survivor still sees himself as a regular and all-too fallible naval officer, one who could not possibly live up to his flawlessly heroic legend. After an act of Syndic treachery during surrender negotiations, Geary, as the most senior captain, is left as the "de facto" fleet commander and with great reluctance takes it upon himself to lead the fleet to the safety of Alliance space. Geary does this in the knowledge that the survival of the hypernet key, the fleet, and of the Alliance itself, all depend on him.
Geary is also forced to retrain the fleet to fight in formation instead of the "modern" free-for-all tactics of charging straight at the enemy, supposedly inspired by Geary's example at his famous last stand. Geary's attempt to change the fleet's culture causes tension with other senior officers, including one egomaniacal senior captain freed from a Syndic labor camp with a reputation almost as famous as Geary's, who proceeds to split off a portion of the fleet on a disastrous mission.
The above insubordination is made possible through the existence of a pseudo-democratic command structure that Geary has to deal with. Over a century of war, characterized by heavy losses due to poor tactics and inexperience, the Alliance Navy's command structure has degenerated into independent ship captains voting on overall fleet decisions. The system resembles an allied clan structure, with a traditional command structure existing below fleet rank. Geary's overall command of the Alliance fleet is constantly threatened by a group of ship commanders who overtly and covertly oppose his leadership. Insubordination, defection, and, eventually, sabotage is instigated against Geary and his closest supporters. To complicate the situation, a third faction wishes to stage a military coup upon the return of the fleet to Alliance space with Geary as dictator. Geary resists the temptation offered by this faction with great effort, though they continue to apply pressure to him throughout the series.
As the entire military force of the Syndicate Worlds continues to hunt the Alliance fleet, Geary is often forced to raid Syndic star systems for supplies and raw materials. During these raids, the fleet gradually uncovers evidence of a third party in this war. Geary believes they are an unknown alien civilization who may have tricked the Syndics into starting the war with the Alliance. These aliens may even have been responsible for humans "discovering" the hypernet and may have sinister reasons for giving humans this technology after Geary discovers that a hypernet gate can be used to destroy an entire star system. The hypothetical aliens also have a means of remote destruction of hypernet gates, which will allow them, given time, to extend the war between the humans indefinitely.
The alien civilization, whatever their designs for humanity are, do not appear to want the Alliance fleet to reach their home space. When Geary leads the fleet to attack the Lakota star system, the aliens manipulate the Syndic hypernet to divert a Syndic fleet to the system.
Throughout the series, Geary is troubled by larger issues. First, he is concerned by the declining state of the Alliance civilian government, which is losing control of its member worlds and the support of the military forces after a century of futile warfare. Also, even though Geary is unswervingly loyal to the Alliance, he fears that the government may choose to imprison him as a threat to its own power. In addition, the Alliance Navy itself has allowed its standards to slip, frequently destroying entire planets and their civilian populations in retaliation for Syndic atrocities, murdering prisoners of war, and has ceased saluting and other traditions reaffirming the command structure. Geary therefore fears that the Alliance may not deserve any victory it might achieve. Combined with these is his speculation that, if the increasingly non-hypothetical aliens are perpetuating the war within human-controlled space, what might their actions be if he can somehow end it?
The Lost Stars.
"The Lost Stars" (formerly "The Phoenix Stars") deals with the collapse of the Syndicate Worlds, and specifically the efforts of Midway System's system CEO commander and ground force CEO commander to deal with the aftermath. The series expands the story to include the viewpoint of Syndicate Worlds citizens and how the leaders of the Midway star system react to the collapse of central authority, occurring at the same time as the events in the "Beyond the Frontier" series.
The series was renamed from "The Phoenix Stars" to "The Lost Stars", and the first book was renamed from "Phoenix Rising" to "Tarnished Knight" and was published in October 2012.
Major themes.
Hemry acknowledged in an interview that "The Lost Fleet" was inspired by Xenophon's Anabasis, detailing the return march of the Ten Thousand, and myths about kings returning to save their nation. In the same interview, Hemry, based on his own military experience, found Geary to be his ideal commanding officer:
He’s a pro, he knows his stuff, but he also knows what he doesn’t know and isn’t afraid to seek advice or sanity checks. A commander needs a lot of self-confidence, but has to balance that with an understanding that he or she isn’t any more perfect than anyone else. (Initially, when he’s still shell-shocked from what has happened to him and is trying to learn how the fleet works ‘today’, Geary is less assertive at times. But part of that is because he’s taking the time to learn how the system works instead of flying in and immediately carpet-bombing everything and everybody.) Geary evaluates his subordinates based on their capabilities, tries not to act on negative reactions to personalities, allows debate, but always makes it clear who’s in charge. Like any other commander, he’s operating within a system that constrains his ability to act, so he has to figure out how to do things right despite that. He also has to avoid the temptation to do things just because he can, since that’s a big step down the slippery slope.
Ancestor worship is a belief system fairly homogeneously embraced within Hemry's universe. This allows Hemry to explore a few aspects of the role of religion in military life without making comment on any current or modern religious group. Personnel in the Alliance fleet are mostly believers, and concerned with the morality of their actions in relation to their religious beliefs. In addition, they think a great deal about the afterlife, which makes sense considering that they constantly face death in the line of duty. Religious concerns, prayer, and terminology are infused throughout all aspects of the lives of the sailors and officers in the fleet, and are often included in official communications and events. Some comments from the narration indicate that there are those in the society who have more or less belief in the existence of their ancestors but no characters are openly identified as such.
A primary theme of John Hemry's work as a whole, and the Lost Fleet series in particular, is the importance of the rule of law, particularly military and naval regulations and the laws of war. Specifically, he deals with the proper treatment of enemy combatants, prisoners, civilians, and saboteurs, as well as traitors within one's own organization. The separation of civilian and military authority is also important to the messages the series conveys. Hemry, through John Geary, continually reinforces the concept that military forces must be subordinate to civilian authority, and shows democratic systems of civilian government (the Alliance) to be superior to a commercial-military autocracy (the Syndics). At the same time, the military must follow established systems of rank and seniority, rather than a democratic system which are is essential to civil society. The character of Co-President (and Alliance Senator) Victoria Rione gives advice and assistance to Geary when necessary, but does not and cannot give actual orders or dictate military policies.
As with other works by Hemry, the proper expression of romantic interest between military personnel is explored and clearly defined as being strictly controlled by those regulations which concern fraternization. While the subject of homosexual relationships is only openly broached once (as a joke between Geary and Captain Roberto Duellos), heterosexual relationships are an important aspect of the plots of the novels. Geary's relationship earlier in the novels with Victoria Rione are legally safe, but politically dangerous. This is in contrast to his relationship later in the novels with Captain Tanya Desjani, an officer who is directly subordinate to Geary as the captain of his flagship, making any romantic situation legally impossible but politically safe within the culture of the fleet. The refusal of Geary and Desjani to act upon any feelings that are legally forbidden continues Hemry's message of the importance of the rule of law and military regulations.
Honor and duty are also strong themes. The double edged nature of honor is explored in the latter half of the series, showing how honor can be both a bulwark against attack, and a knife to one's own throat.
The themes within this book also seem to concentrate loosely around knowledge of the Latin America political system and aspects of the American political system. It has strong inferences to the iron triangle, oligarchy, and corporatism. It is clear the author highly respects an involved democratic system, and treats other systems and power structures with suspicion or negatively based on the losers and winners in his books.
Reception.
"We Read Science Fiction" reviewed the series and gave it a good review, giving positive comments on the narrative and the detailed battle scenes. The only complaint directed at the series in the review was Hemry's tendency to repeat details from earlier books in later books. Hemry himself replied to the review thanking them for their comments and explaining that he repeats information for the readers who picked up later books but have not had the chance to read from the beginning of the series with "Dauntless".

Gozo F.C.

Gozo Football Club is a Maltese football club based on the island of Gozo. Gozo FC was founded in 1987. 
Gozo FC is run by the Gozo Football Association. The Gozo FC represents the island of Gozo in the Maltese Leagues. Its squad is formed of Gozitan players who play their trade in the Gozitan Leagues mainly in the First Division. Their home matches are played at the Gozo Stadium.
Through the years.
After their foundation Gozo FC spent most of their years in the Second Division and in the Third Division. In the season 1997/1998 finally Gozo FC won the Section B of the Second Division, that is the third tier of the Maltese League system. Subsequently in the following season that is 1998/1999 they participated in the First Division and surprisingly topped the table with Zurrieq F.C. with 35 points. However, having a better goal difference they won the first division title. This was somewhat a big feat for a small club like Gozo FC who had within just two years gone from the Maltese Second Division to the Maltese Premier League.
The Historical Year.
The 1999-2000 season is considered to be the highlight of the short history of the Gozo FC. Not only did they compete with the elite for the first time in their history, but for the first - and to date the only - time they made it to the quarter-finals of the Maltese Cup by beating Lija Athletic 4-2 in Gozo in the second round. They were drawn against Maltese powerhouse Sliema Wanderers, and even though their tie was played at home, they could not match up to their more illustrious opponents and suffered a 6-1 defeat.
Their performance in the Maltese Premier League was a good one overall, despite it lasting only one season. The first round was a very positive one for Gozo. When the division was split into two, Gozo FC occupied eighth position with 14 points from 18 outings. Given they were considered the hot favourites for relegation, their performances were above expectations and they never suffered a humiliating defeat. The biggest defeat was a 5-1 defeat suffered in the hands of Floriana. While from 9 away fixtures they only collected five points, a win against Pieta Hotspurs and two draws with Naxxar Lions and Zurrieq respectively, at home they proved to be a difficult bone to crack down. A 1-0 historic victory over leaders and eventual champions Birkirkara was the highlight of the campaign. For sure to date this is the most prestigious victory in the whole history of Gozo FC. Other prestigious results achieved include the 1-1 draw against Hibernians, followed by wins against Zurrieq and draws against Rabat Ajax and Pieta Hotspurts respectively. Also other significant results are marginal defeats suffered against more illustrious opponents such as against then current champions Valletta (2-0 at home and 1-0 at Ta' Qali) and Sliema Wanderers (2-1 at home).
The second round proved not to be as positive as the first round. A single win and 3 draws from 6 outings weren't enough and in the end Gozo FC were relegated to the Maltese First Division after a solitary season in the Maltese Premier League. In the whole season Gozo FC scored a total of 22 goals and conceded only 39, the fourth best defence in the premier division.
Decline.
The relegation to the first division proved to be the start of the decline of the Gozitans. In the season 2000/2001 they ended in the seventh position. The following season saw little improvement and again finished in the seventh position. In the season 2002/2003 Gozo FC got relegated to the Second Division when they finished in the 9 th place with 17 points. However they returned to the First division on the first time of asking after beating Gzira United in the promotion playoff. Their adventure in the First division lasted only when season and they were relegated again to the Second Division. Gozo FC finished bottom with a single win and 4 draws from 18 outings. In the 2005/2006 Gozo FC showed some good performances and they ended their campaign in a comfortable sixth position. The following season Gozo FC were relegated to the lowest tier of the Maltese League, the Maltese Third Division when they finished bottom with 11 points. For the 2007/2008 Gozo FC were drawn in the Section B. This time, Gozo FC were in class of their own and proved too strong for their opponents and topped the Third Division Secion B. From 16 outings they recorded 15 wins and 1 draw, coming against Kalkara totaling to 46 points from a possible 48. They scored 40 goals and let in only 14 goals. This entitled them for a promotion play-off against Zebbug Rangers which won their respective division that is Section A. While Gozo FC were winning 3-1 and were dominating the match, in the 57th minute the match was abandoned. This happened because the assistant referee was hit by an object in his head and the referee had no other option but to abandon the match. Of course the Gozitans were disappointed to see this happen because they were waiting for the moment to lift the cup from September but now they had to wait for the decision to be took by the MFA about the final result of the match. Given that Gozo FC had nothing to do with those actions they were handed the cup and as well promoted to the Second Division. Former Valletta striker Chris Camilleri finished runner-up in the scoring charts.

Azerbaijan in the Eurovision Dance Contest

Azerbaijan took part for the first time in the Eurovision Dance Contest in 2008 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. Azerbaijan came in 5th place with 106 points, getting two 12 points from Lithuania and Poland.
The EBU confirmed that the Eurovision Dance Contest 2010 will be held in Baku, Azerbaijan at the Heydar Aliev Sports and Concert Complex in 2010.
2008.
Azerbaijan debuted in the Eurovision Dance Contest in 2008, after debuting in the Eurovision Song Contest in the same year. They were represented by Eldar Jafarov and Anna Sajina, who were selected internally. They danced to a version of "Phantom of the Opera", from the musical of the same name, arranged by Yashar Bahysh. Their routine was a fusion of Paso Doble, Rumba, Tango, and Azeri Folk Dance.
2009.
According to contest coordinator on behalf of EBU Tal Barnea "concrete plans for a 2010 autumn event are now being developed, with considerable changes to introduce a new programme proposal". These plans are expected to be unveiled in the autumn of 2009. EBU also praised "the commendable work on the next Eurovision Dance Contest already completed by our partners Ictimai Television and the Azerbaijani officials" stating that 2010 edition of the contest is planned to take place in Baku, Azerbaijan as well. 
In January 2010, EBU Eurovision coordinator, Svante Stockselius, announced that contest has been postponed again, and is now unlikely to happen at all, at least within the next couple of years. He explained this decision with the fact that the boom of the TV dance shows has calmed down recently.

Controversy.
Azerbaijan and Greece announced professional dance couples as their representatives at the Eurovision Dance Contest 2008. According to the regulations of the contest, professional couples were not allowed to take part in the competition. The EBU specified that the couple had to be composed of one professional (defined as a dancer who earns his or her living through dance and dance-related activities), and one non-professional known in a field other than dance. The non-professional was not required to be a celebrity, as long as he or she was known in his field, and it was also not a requirement that the non-professional had no dance experience. Since the representatives for Azerbaijan and Greece both consisted of two professional dancers, however, it is not clear why their entries were considered valid.

The easy-to-walk, shade-covered trail follows what was originally part of a trolley line that shuttled passengers between Ellicott City and Baltimore from the late 1890s to the mid-1950s. A century after its construction, in the 1990s, the abandoned right-of-way was converted as part of a rails-to-trails program. Today, the path is paved and features a section of boardwalk next to walls of rock that were hand-cut by the original builders.

SR-22 (insurance)

In the United States, an SR-22 is a vehicle liability insurance document used by some state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices. A DMV may require an SR-22 from a driver to reinstate his or her driving privileges following an uninsured car accident or conviction of another traffic-related offense, such as a DUI. An SR-22 may be required for three years for driving without insurance or driving with a suspended license and up to five years for a DUI. If an SR-22 should expire or be canceled, the insurance company is required to issue an SR-26 form, which certifies the cancellation of the policy.

Free shipping

Free shipping is a marketing tactic used primarily by online vendors and mail-order catalogs as a sales strategy to attract customers. 
Online sales model.
Internet vendors benefit from a simplified sales model as compared to traditional brick-and-mortar stores. By storing goods remotely at a warehouse location and shipping goods directly to a consumer, significant transportation needs are eliminated both on the part of the vendor (shipping goods to stores) any by the consumer (traveling to stores). Additionally, near universal access to the Internet means that a relatively few warehouse locations can compete with a market without having to deal with amounts of real-estate.
Shipping and Fees.
The simplified business model provides potentially lower costs or higher profit margins for remote vendors. The 'up front pricing' model attracts customers with low up-front prices reflecting the lower cost of goods to the vendor with less overhead. The vendor would then add the cost of shipping, and any other applicable fees to the order before processing. Since the vendor typically makes the shipping arrangements, it is entirely possible that the cost of shipping passed on to the consumer will not be the same as the cost of shipping borne by the vendor. Some online vendors use this as a source of revenue, further increasing profits or allowing the vendor to advertise even lower up-front prices. (The classic joke here is the "free car" worth $20,000 that has a $30,000 shipping and handling fee) 
Free Shipping Day.
"Free Shipping Day" was created and has run since 2008. One day in the holiday season (in 2010, this day was December 17th), companies such as Toys "R" Us and J. C. Penney participate by offering free shipping. These merchants are featured on the official Free Shipping Day website. There were 1,750 participating merchants in 2010. ComScore estimates that shoppers spent more than $942 million on Free Shipping Day, 2010, a 61% increase over the previous year.

Henry L. Eustis

Henry Lawrence Eustis (February 1, 1819 – January 11, 1885) was a civil engineer, college professor, and soldier who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Early life and career.
Henry Eustis was born at Fort Independence near Boston, Massachusetts. His father Abraham Eustis, a career army officer, was stationed there at the time. Henry graduated from Harvard University in 1838 and then attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After graduating first in his class, Eustis was assigned to engineering roles, including working on several improvements to the unfinished Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. Eustis taught engineering at West Point from 1847 to 1849. He resigned on November 30, 1849, and took an appointment teaching engineering at Harvard.
Civil War.
After the Civil War broke out, Eustis joined the volunteer infantry being raised in Massachusetts. He was commissioned as the new colonel of the 10th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry on August 21, 1862. (The regiment had been mustered into the service on June 21, 1861.) He joined the division of Brig. Gen. Darius Couch in the IV Corps, Army of the Potomac. Couch’s division served in the Maryland Campaign, but it was not present at the Battle of Antietam.
After the battle, the division became 3rd Division of the VI Corps under Brig. Gen. John Newton. Eustis participated in the Battle of Fredericksburg in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Charles Devens. He then served under Col. William H. Browne in the Chancellorsville campaign. When Browne was wounded at the Battle of Salem Church, Eustis succeeded to command of the brigade. He led the brigade at the Battle of Gettysburg, where his units were in reserve. Eustis became a brigadier general on September 12, 1863. He served in the autumn campaigns of 1863 under Brig. Gen. Henry Dwight Terry, who had taken over after Newton became commander of I corps.
In the reorganization of the Army of the Potomac preceding Ulysses S. Grant’s Overland Campaign in 1864, Eustis’s brigade was moved to the 2nd Division of VI Corps under Brig. Gen. George Getty. Eustis commanded his brigade in the Battle of the Wilderness. After Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick was killed at the Battle of Spotsylvania, Brig. Gen. Horatio Wright became the corps commander. Brig. Gen. David Allen Russell took over Wright’s 1st Division and Eustis was moved to the command of Russell’s former brigade. He led this brigade at Spotsylvania and the subsequent actions of the army through the Battle of Cold Harbor. Eustis resigned his commission on June 27, 1864, for reasons of “health.” It is reported that he was compelled to resign because of his addiction to opium, which caused neglect of military duties.
Post-war.
Eustis returned to teaching at Harvard and wrote several technical articles, as well as a genealogy of his family in 1878. He became the dean of the Lawrence Scientific School, later the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He was holding that post when he died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 11, 1885. 
General Eustis was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.

His major work is his extension of Salomon de Brosse and Jacques Lemercier's Palais du Luxembourg between 1836 and 1841 - in 1835 he added a new facade overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens, and in 1836 he extended the lateral façades into the gardens in the same style as the side facing the gardens, creating a new wood-panelled Chamber of Sessions on the first floor. He also restored the arms of France and of the Medici on the fountain in the gardens, and created a 50m long rectangle of water bounded by an alley of plane trees. His work there was completed by Delacroix. 
He also worked on the Ecole Normale Supérieure (1847).

Neural correlates of consciousness

The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept. Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover neural correlates of subjective phenomena. The set should be "minimal" because, if the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.
Neurobiological approach to consciousness.
A science of consciousness must explain the exact relationship between subjective mental states and brain states, the nature of the relationship between the conscious mind and the electro-chemical interactions in the body. Progress in neurophilosophy has come from focusing on the body rather than the mind. In this context the neuronal correlates of consciousness may be viewed as its causes, and consciousness may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.
Discovering and characterizing neural correlates does not offer a theory of consciousness that can explain how particular systems experience anything at all, or how they are associated with consciousness, the so-called hard problem of consciousness, but understanding the NCC may be a step toward such a theory. Most neurobiologists assume that the variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level, governed by classical physics, though a few scholars have proposed theories of quantum consciousness based on quantum mechanics.
There is great apparent redundancy and parallelism in neural networks so, while activity in one group of neurons may correlate with a percept in one case, a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated. It may be that every phenomenal, subjective state has a neural correlate. Where the NCC can be induced artificially the subject will experience the associated percept, while perturbing or inactivating the region of correlation for a specific percept will affect the percept or cause it to disappear, giving a cause-effect relationship from the neural region to the nature of the percept.
What characterizes the NCC? What are the commonalities between the NCC for seeing and for hearing? Will the NCC involve all pyramidal neurons in cortex at any given point in time? Or only a subset of long-range projection cells in frontal lobes that project to the sensory cortices in the back? Neurons that fire in a rhythmic manner? Neurons that fire in a synchronous manner? These are some of the proposals that have been advanced over the years.
The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools (e.g., Adamantidis et al. 2007) depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioral assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. It is the combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness, one of the central mysteries of life.
Level of arousal and content of consciousness.
There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term "consciousness", one involving "arousal" and "states of consciousness" and the other involving "content of consciousness" and "conscious states". To be conscious "of" anything the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called "vigilance"), whether in wakefulness or REM sleep, vividly experienced in dreams although usually not remembered. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a circadian rhythm but may be influenced by lack of sleep, drugs and alcohol, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction (for instance, the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source). Clinicians use scoring systems such as the Glasgow Coma Scale to assess the level of arousal in patients.
High arousal states are associated with conscious states that have specific content, seeing, hearing, remembering, planning or fantasizing about something. Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences. The "awake" state is quite different from the "dreaming" state (for instance, the latter has little or no self-reflection) and from the state of deep sleep. In all three cases the basic physiology of the brain is affected, as it also is in "altered states of consciousness", for instance after taking drugs or during meditation when conscious perception and insight may be enhanced compared to the normal waking state. 
Clinicians talk about "impaired states of consciousness" as in "the comatose state", "the persistent vegetative state" (PVS), and "the minimally conscious state" (MCS). Here, "state" refers to different "amounts" of external/physical consciousness, from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in a minimally conscious state such as sleep walking or during a complex partial epileptic seizure. The repertoire of conscious states or experiences accessible to a patient in a minimally conscious state is comparatively limited. In brain death there is no arousal, but it is unknown whether the subjectivity of experience has been interrupted, rather than its observable link with the organism. 
The potential "richness of conscious experience" appears to increase from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness, as might be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience to give an integrated-information-theoretical account of consciousness. As behavioral arousal increases so does the range and complexity of possible behavior. Yet in REM sleep there is a characteristic atonia, low motor arousal and the person is difficult to wake up, but there is still high metabolic and electric brain activity and vivid perception.
Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the thalamus, midbrain and pons must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the amygdala, thalamus, claustrum and the basal ganglia.
The neuronal basis of perception.
The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made vision a preferred modality in the quest for the NCC. Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques – masking, binocular rivalry, continuous flash suppression, motion induced blindness, change blindness, inattentional blindness – in which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject's mind is disrupted. In particular a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time: the image is projected into one of the observer's eyes but is invisible, not seen. In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated, permitting visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain. In a "perceptual illusion", the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates. The best known example is the "Necker cube" whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth.
A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is "binocular rivalry". Here, a small image, e.g., a horizontal grating, is presented to the left eye, and another image, e.g., a vertical grating, is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye. In spite of the constant visual stimulus, observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one. The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images. 
Logothetis and colleagues recorded a variety of visual cortical areas in awake macaque monkeys performing a binocular rivalry task. Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image. The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon. In the primary visual cortex (V1) only a small fraction of cells weakly modulated their response as a function of the percept of the monkey while most cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time. But in a high-level cortical area such as the inferior temporal cortex along the ventral stream almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus, so that a "face" cell only fired when the animal indicated that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye. This implies that NCC involve neurons active in the inferior temporal cortex: it is likely that specific reciprocal actions of neurons in the inferior temporal and parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary.
A number of fMRI experiments that have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans demonstrate quite conclusively that BOLD activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway (e.g., the fusiform face area and the parahippocampal place area) as well as in early regions, including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), follow the percept and not the retinal stimulus. Further, a number of fMRI experiments suggest V1 is necessary but not sufficient for visual consciousness.
In a related perceptual phenomenon, "flash suppression", the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye while the original image remains. Its methodological advantage over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event. The majority of cells in the inferior temporal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal's percept: when the cell's preferred stimulus is perceived, the cell responds. If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed, the cell falls silent, even though primary visual cortex neurons fire. Single-neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of response when the preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked.
Global disorders of consciousness.
Given the absence of any accepted criterion of the minimal neuronal correlates necessary for consciousness the distinction between a persistently vegetative patient, who shows regular sleep-wave transitions and may be able to move or smile, and a minimally conscious patient who can communicate (on occasion) in a meaningful manner (for instance, by differential eye movements) and who shows some signs of consciousness, is often difficult. In global anesthesia the patient should not experience psychological trauma but the level of arousal should be compatible with clinical exigencies.
Blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI (BOLD fMRI) have demonstrated normal patterns of brain activity in a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house. Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including akinetic mutism) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of awareness. Impaired consciousness in epileptic seizures of the temporal lobe was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the mediodorsal thalamus.
Relatively local bilateral injuries to midline (paramedian) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of awareness. These structures therefore "enable" and control brain arousal (as determined by metabolic or electrical activity) and are necessary neural correlates. One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen nuclei on each side of the upper brainstem (pons, midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus), collectively referred to as the reticular activating system (RAS). Their axons project widely throughout the brain. These nuclei – three-dimensional collections of neurons with their own cyto-architecture and neurochemical identity – release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine and orexin/hypocretin to control the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain, mediating alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as general level of behavioral and brain arousal. After such trauma, however, eventually the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return. Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus. These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly, directly to the basal ganglia and, in a more distributed manner, into layer I of much of the neocortex. Comparatively small (1 cm3 or less) bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness.
Forward versus feedback projections.
Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid, transient, stereotyped, and unconscious. They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behavior as seen, e.g., in complex partial epileptic seizures. These automated responses, sometimes called "zombie behaviors", could be contrasted by a slower, all-purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader, less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs (or a reflection of these, as in imagery) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses. Without such a consciousness mode, a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events.
A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.
From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioral programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner, and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behavior. This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness. 
It seems possible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the dorsal stream in the parietal region. However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream, at least under some circumstances. The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas (beyond V1) and especially on the ventral stream. 
Seemingly complex visual processing (such as detecting animals in natural, cluttered scenes) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130–150 ms, far too brief for eye movements and conscious perception to occur. Furthermore, reflexes such as the oculovestibular reflex take place at even more rapid time-scales. It is quite plausible that such behaviors are mediated by a purely feed-forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1, into V4, IT and prefrontal cortex, until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press (as in a typical laboratory experiment). The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times (approx. 100 ms) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells.
Conversely, conscious perception is believed to require more sustained, reverberatory neural activity, most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions, thalamus, claustrum and related structures that support short-term memory, multi-modality integration, planning, speech, and other processes intimately related to consciousness. Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented. This is the core hypothesis of the global workspace theory of consciousness.
In brief, while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo-cortical system can mediate complex behavior without conscious sensation, it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well-organized neural activity dependent on long-range cortico-cortical feedback.

Way to Normal

Way to Normal is a 2008 studio album by Ben Folds. It was released on 30 September 2008 in the United States and on 29 September 2008 in the United Kingdom. The album is Folds' highest-charting debut ever in the US, reaching #11 on the "Billboard" 200 in its first week of release.
A music video for "You Don't Know Me" was directed by Eric Wareheim, featuring Eric himself and his comedy partner Tim Heidecker.
In 2009, Folds re-released the album in less compressed audio quality as "Stems and Seeds", adding various bonus tracks and providing "stems" for fans to create their own remixes.
Production notes.
The album is named after Normal, Illinois as referenced in the track "Effington". "Effington" refers to Effingham, Illinois.
The song "Hiroshima" is about a time when Folds fell off the stage during a concert in Hiroshima. The subtitle "B B B Benny Hit His Head" is also a reference to the Elton John song Bennie and the Jets. John says "B B B Bennie" during the main chorus, which Hiroshima's subtitle mimics. Both songs share a fake audience in the background, as well as having a similar melody with different timing.
The metallic percussive effect on "Free Coffee" was achieved by placing Altoids tins on top of the piano strings and feeding the audio output through a distortion pedal; Folds demonstrated this in live performances of the song. (See prepared piano)
"Dr. Yang" was used in the trailer for the 2011 film, "Mars Needs Moms".
"Before Cologne" was used for the introduction of the iPhone 4S.
Fake leak.
On 16 July 2008, an anonymous user posted what they claimed was a "leak" of Folds's latest album on two fan sites. The file contained nine tracks along with a PDF of supposed cover art, and was a mix of what appeared to be legitimate songs from "Way to Normal" and bizarre pastiches of foul-mouthed humour and melodramatic pop. Accordingly, the online forums became full of debate as to which were real and which were fake until 12 August 2008 when Folds admitted on Triple J radio that many songs in the leak were fake.
He claimed that he and the band recorded fake versions of songs from the new album when they "had a night to kill in Dublin", and had a friend leak it to the public "to give them something to listen to".
After confirming that the leaked "Brainwascht", "The Frown Song" and "Free Coffee Town" were fake, he stated that they will be used as B-sides and bonus tracks on upcoming releases. A few days later, in a "Rolling Stone" article, Folds discussed the differences between the real album cuts and the fake leak cuts.

Tavo Nachón

Tavo Nachón is the main protagonist in the TV series "Skimo". He is portrayed by actor Miguel Santa Rita.
Profile.
Tavo is the total opposite of Fito but also his inseparable best friend. He is a shy, methodical 16-year old boy overly obsessed with cleanliness and health. He often finds himself in situations because of his obsession for order and control. He often smears his hands in alcohol or gel to eliminate bacteria, or reads the anti-cancer properties of broccoli and other foods. Tavo is very thoughtful, sensitive and cautious so that business would be at its peak. He is highly organized: always doing things on a long list of events. Tavo sometimes treats Ursula as if she was his girlfriend. He enjoys anything near or to do with Ursula (like when he organized her sweet 16, which is almost ruined by the twins). Tavo is intelligent and very nice. He secretly had a crush on Ursula, and asked if she wanted to be his girlfriend in the 1st season but she said no. In the second season the two of them tried to forget about having a romantic relationship, and to just be friends. Tavo sees Ursula on the verge of kissing Fito in the last season since Ursula started to like Fito but no one knew this.
Relations.
Although Tavo and Fito possess such different personalities (or maybe that's why), they are inseparable. Also their friendship is very competitive, which is why we always see them trying to show who is the best at everything. This benefits the business but also puts them in constant problems. Tavo is often intimidated by the constant attacks and insults from the twins Nora and Nori, who he hates more than anyone in the world. Tavo is very obsessive, controlling and paranoid, and falls into problems and even fights with his friends because of his personality. Compared to some people, Tavo has a conservative look and has no piercings and rings on his body; always well managed.

Rodney, Mississippi

Rodney is a former city in Jefferson County in southwest Mississippi, approximately northeast of Natchez. Rodney was founded in 1828, and in the 19th century, it was only three votes away from becoming the capital of the Mississippi Territory. Its population declined to nearly zero after the Mississippi River changed course. The Rodney Center Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Today a small number of inhabitants remain but the area is considered a ghost town and reliable data is hard to find as the town isn't listed as a separate entity by the census bureau.
Early history.
Rodney was originally settled by the French in January 1763 and named Petit Gouffre, meaning "Little Gulf". As a result of the French and Indian War, the area was taken by Great Britain. Spain would later control this area after taking West Florida from the British in 1781. Spain would hold the site until selling it to Thomas Calvit in 1798. The city was later renamed Rodney in 1828 in honor of Judge Thomas Rodney.
Structures and city layout.
The Old Rodney Presbyterian Church was dedicated in 1832. It is located at the middle section of the town, across the Rodney – Red Bone – Lorman Road from Alston Grocery Store. Formerly at the south edge of the town was Sacred Heart Catholic Church, built in 1869. On the southeast corner of Rodney lies Alston's Grocery, operated by the Alston family since 1915.
Alston's Grocery Store, actually a country general store, closed many years ago but
the building still stands. In the northeast corner of the town is a small park where regular band concerts were held by the Jefferson County Band. On the northwest corner are remains of a wooden drugstore. West of Alston's Grocery is the one surviving structure on Batchelor Street. Located at the southwest corner is a two-story brick structure. At the western end of Batchelor St. is Mt. Zion No. 1 Baptist Church, a white frame structure combining several styles of architecture which was constructed in 1850. The Presbyterian Church has a solid shot above the middle window which appears to have been fired by a 12 lb. Napoleon. It was placed there when a group of officers from the U.S.S. Rattler decided to attend services one Sunday and a unit of Confederate cavalry from Grand Gulf began the process of arresting them all as prisoners of war. Shooting started and the Rattler returned fire striking the Church. The minister was known at the time as a Union sympathizer and left shortly thereafter. 
Other.
Rodney was noted for its high level of culture, county fairs and business activity. Rodney once contained a bank, a newspaper, 500 people and 35 stores, artists, theater, lecture hall, schools, debating society, churches, jockey club and thespian groups. Cottonseed development, riverboat landings, taverns and high literacy made Rodney a leading river town. Among the businesses fronting on Commerce and Magnolia Streets were a bank, wagon makers, tinsmiths, barbers, doctors, dentists, general mercantile stores, hotels, saloons, and pastry shops. Mississippi Lodge #56 of the Free and Accepted Masons was located in Rodney from the 1850s until the 1920s. It was not unusual for traveling thespians on the show boats to play at Rodney and use the Masonic Hall for their performances. Rodney Town Cemetery is now abandoned and overgrown. Many people from across the Mississippi River brought their dead to Rodney and buried them above the overflow line.
Growth.
The 1850 United States Census listed the population of Rodney as 210.
Civil War effects.
In June 1863, forty Union hand-picked cavalry troops of the 5th Illinois Cavalry under the command of Captain Calvin Mann, were disembarked in Rodney to launch a surprise raid across the state to the Confederate-controlled Mobile and Ohio Railroad in Alabama. The Confederates, pursuing them after their raid on Brookhaven and the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern railroad facilities there, would later capture the Union troops at a skirmish near Rocky Creek outside of Ellisville, Jones County, Mississippi on June 26, 1863.
After the fall of Vicksburg, the Union Navy was in charge of the Mississippi River. The gunboat "Rattler" was stationed in front of Rodney to ensure the federal control of this important town, and aware that the area was not completely secure, the admiral left strict orders that no sailor was to leave the ship. But on Sunday September 12, 1863, 22 sailors, contrary to these orders, a lieutenant, and a captain left the ship dressed in their best uniforms, and quietly seated themselves amongst the Presbyterian Church congregation. As the second hymn was being sung, a Lt. Allen of the Confederate Cavalry walked up the aisle to the pulpit. Apologizing to the Reverend Baker, he turned and announced that his men had surrounded the building and demanded the Yankee sailors surrender. One of the Yankee sailors jumped behind a door and took a shot at Lt. Allen. A general melee broke out, and most of the citizens dove under their pews for safety and reputedly one Yankee sailor hid in the undergarments of his local southern girlfriend. One older lady, however, would not run. She stood up in her pew and shouted "Glory to God!" A skeleton crew had remained on board the "Rattler", and, when they heard the commotion, began firing their guns at the church. The church and four homes were hit. The firing ceased once word was sent that the Confederates threatened to execute the prisoners. It was on this day that a cannonball lodged itself in the front wall of the Presbyterian Church. The Confederate Army had taken 17 prisoners, including the lieutenant and captain. The crew of the Rattler became the laughingstock of the nation, for it was the first time in history a small squad of cavalry captured the crew of an ironclad gunboat. (Local history tells us that the cannonball that is imbedded very high up in the front of the Church was placed there many years later. The original one had fallen out. Photos of the church in the 1930's one on this site show no cannonball in the front of the church) To eliminate all Confederate presence in Rodney, Union infantrymen landed in Rodney and plundered almost every house in town. Citizens of Rodney later formed Company D. 22nd Mississippi infantry to fight against the Union army. 
Famous people.
Rodney was host to many notable visitors, including Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay and Zachary Taylor. Taylor was so taken by the area that he purchased Cypress Grove Plantation, complete with 81 slaves, in 1842. It was at this time that Taylor's daughter, Sarah, eloped with Lt. Jefferson Davis, much to her father's dismay. Taylor's house, which was located on the property south of Rodney, would later cave in and fall into the Mississippi River.
Although Rodney entertained some important political figures, one of its own residents made quite a name for himself. Dr. Rush Nutt, a native of Virginia, came to Rodney in 1815. It would be Dr. Nutt who led the south to become the cotton kingdom of the world. His contributions were two-fold. The cotton seed being used in the area had developed a rot that destroyed half-the crop. His extensive research led him to develop new methods to grow cotton. A new strain of cotton called "Egypto-Mexican" cotton was more resilient. Nutt improved Eli Whitney's cotton gin by connecting the gin to steam power. His son Haller's never finished Natchez home, Longwood, was the last burst of southern opulence before war brought the cotton barons' dominance to an end. Longwood, fortunately, survived decades of neglect and near-abandonment to become one of Natchez's most popular attractions. However, Haller grew up at Laurel Hill, Dr. Nutt's house, just east of Rodney. 
American Indians.
Early maps dating back to 1715 suggest that the site where Rodney stands today was originally a location where local Native Americans crossed the Mississippi. The Rodney area has long been regarded as an important place for crossing the Mississippi River. Crossing the Missisisppi was a major problem until the construction of bridges in the 1930s. Rodney was also said to be the one of the early crossings for the Spanish colonial trade route El Camino Reale.

Kingsport, Nova Scotia

Kingsport, is a small seaside village located in Kings County, Nova Scotia on the shores of the Minas Basin.
Geography.
Kingsport is located just northeast of the mouth of the Habitant River, on the west side of Minas Basin, a few miles east of Canning at the eastern end of Route 221. It is bordered by a tidal marsh to the west and sandy beaches to the south and east. Red sedimentary cliffs carved by continuous erosion rise from the beaches to the east. The dramatic 12 metre tides produce very large sand and mud flats at low tide. The village is surrounded by large expanses of fertile farmland.
An earlier name was Indian Point, later changed to Oak Point due to the number of oak trees that grew along the bank of the south side of the lower road, leading to the wharf. The name was finally changed to Kingsport in the 1870s, as it became the major port in Kings County.
Early history.
As indicated by the name Indian Point, Kingsport is believed to have once been a summer settlement of the Mi'kmaq. It was also part of the Acadian farming community which stretched along the Habitant River. After the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755, Kingsport was settled by New England Planters One source indicates that Indian Point is mentioned as Lot 16, second division, Cornwallis township granted to Benjamin Newcomb in 1761. Another source says that Kingsport was founded in 1761 or 1762 by Isaac Bigelow who came from Connecticut and was given a grant of land called Oak Point, now Kingsport.
Bigelow is the most favoured and Isaac’s son, Ebenezer, born in 1776, is thought to have built the first house in Kingsport.
Shipbuilding and the Railway.
Shipbuilding emerged as a major industry in Kingsport beginning in 1833 with the launch of schooner "Emerald". "Some of the largest and finest ships ever built in Canada were designed and built by Ebenezer Cox of Kingsport," according to shipping historian Frederick William Wallace. Starting with the schooner "Diadem" in 1864, Cox became the master shipbuilder for a series of partnerships which built over 30 vessels of increasing size. Most had names beginning with the letter "K" and began known as the "K Ships". The shipyard included a large mill and blacksmith and used tuboats to brings rafts of timber from the Cape Blomidon area. The Kingsport yards reached their peak in 1890 with the launch of the four masted barque "Kings County" followed by the ship "Canada" in 1891, two of the largest wooden ships ever built in Canada. Launch days for these vessels were the biggest events in the history of Kingsport, some of them attracting up to 3000 people from across the Annapolis Valley. The collapse of the wooden shipbuilding industry in Atlantic Canada in the late 19th century led to a decline in the yard with the last major launch being the barquentine "Skoda" in 1893. The final Kingsport built vessel was the schooner "FBG" built in 1929, the last coastal schooner built in all of Nova Scotia. The Kingsport yard refocused for a number of years on ship repair, using the massive Minas Basin tides as a natural drydock into the 1920s repairing such vessels as the American "Bradford C. French", the largest three masted schooner ever built.
As wooden ships declined, shipbuilding investors in the Kingsport area re-invested in railways. The Cornwallis Valley Railway was built in 1890 connecting Kingsport to Kentville and the mainline of the Dominion Atlantic Railway. Kingsport was the terminus for the eastern end of the line. A wye and engine shed were built to turn and service locomotives under the care for many years of Ephraim Hiltz. Trains ran four times a day at the peak of the line. The railway rapidly developed the surrounding apple industry and two large apple warehouses were soon constructed in the village. The line also exploited the large wharf at Kingsport as a regional shipping point for schooners and ocean steamers. It was steadily extended to over 400 feet by 1911 and received a lighthouse in 1889. Apples and potatoes were exported with coal and fertilizer being imported as well as various freight including on one occasion, horses from Sable Island. 
The railway also connected at the wharf with the "Parrsboro packets", a series of coastal steamships carrying passengers, vehicles and freight to the Minas Basin ports of Wolfville and Parrsboro, the last of which was the MV Kipawo. Kingsport also became a local holiday resort. People came during the summer months to spend time at their cottages along the bank and at the "bluff". First a hotel, and in later years an ice cream parlour and a dance hall were operated near the wharf area during the summer months.
Kingsport's social life included skating and hockey on Webb's pond and baseball during the spring and summer. Concerts, motion picture shows, pie socials, annual strawberry festivals, harvest suppers, card parties and Whist Club were among social functions. A drive-in operated in the 1930s and 1940s. An Congregational (later United) and Anglican church served Kingsport along with two story school which also served as a community hall.
Postwar.
The Minas Basin ferry service ended during World War II when "Kipawo" was called away to war service. The apple industry surrounding Kingsport faced a dramatic downturn with the loss of the British market after the war. This led to a steady decline in traffic on the Cornwallis Valley Railway which ended service to Kingsport in 1961. The growth of highways also bled local shoppers to bigger stores elsewhere. The school was closed in 1963. Both of Kingsport's general stores and its gas station closed. The massive wharf steadily fell into ruins and the village lost half its population in a few decades, declining from 500 to 225 by the 1950s.
Recent years.
However Kingsport remained a popular local holiday location for cottagers and in the 1970s emerged as a bedroom community for the growing towns of Eastern Kings County. In 1977, the Kingsport Community Association was organized to improve life in Kingsport. Social events such as pie socials and card parties were held to help bring the residents together and to raise funds to build a playground, clean up the beach and provide steps and picnic tables. In 2003, the Kingsport Community Association began reconstruction of the ruins of the wharf. The outer portions were demolished and the inner portion was rebuilt into a boardwalk, boat ramp, and floats to encourage recreational boating. The association rebuilt a former general store in 2004 as a community centre and public access point for internet use.
Popular culture.
L.M. Montgomery used the name Kingsport in her novel Anne of the Island as a moniker for the fictional Nova Scotia town where Anne Shirley attends university after she leaves Avonlea. The fictional Kingsport is a larger town combining elements inspired by Halifax and Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia.
The famous Canadian poet Bliss Carman wrote a classic poem of courage about a Kingsport schooner named "Scud" and her fearless twelve-year-old master. Entitled "Arnold, Master of the Scud", it featured in many Canadian poetry textbooks.
Kingsport features prominently in the book "Blomidon Rose", a nostalgic look at the life and landscape of 1930s Annapolis Valley by Esther Clark Wright.

Kexec

In computing, kexec (coming from kernel execution, derived from the Unix/Linux kernel call exec) is a mechanism of the Linux kernel that allows "live" booting of a new kernel "over" the currently running kernel. Essentially, kexec skips the bootloader stage (hardware initialization phase by the system firmware, BIOS or UEFI) and directly loads the new kernel into memory, where it starts executing immediately. This avoids the long times associated with a full reboot, and can help systems to meet high-availability requirements by minimizing downtime.
While feasible, implementing a mechanism such as kexec raises two major challenges:
There are security concerns associated with the kexec mechanism, as basically anything can be loaded and executed that way, due to the fact that new kernel to be executed is not required to be signed. In other words, despite a robust in-kernel mechanism for ensuring that only signed Linux kernel modules can be inserted into the running kernel, root user can still load arbitrary code via kexec and execute it.

Alexandre-Jean-Baptiste-Guy de Gisors (1762–1835) was a French architect.
His works include the Église de la Madeleine in Paris, and Saint-Vincent Cathedral in Mâcon in 1816. In about 1810 he took over the ongoing designs for the Piazza del Popolo in Rome, succeeding Giuseppe Valadier and adhering to Valadier's grand plan.
A.-J.-B.-G. de Gisors should not be confused with his relative and contemporary, French architect Jacques Pierre Gisors (1755–1818). Jacques Pierre worked on the Palais Bourbon (seat of French National Assembly) in 1795, and there with Emmanuel-Chérubin Leconte designed the "Salle des Cinq Cents", the Council of the Five Hundred.
Sources differ on whether the two were brothers or cousins. Sources also differ on which of the two won the Prix de Rome for architecture in 1779. :fr:1778 en architecture If A.-J.-B.-G. de Gisors, he would have been age 17, not impossible for a prodigy, but Jacques Pierre would have been a far more likely age of 24.

Bishop Bell School

The Bishop Bell School (full title: The Bishop Bell Church of England Mathematics & Computing Specialist School) is a voluntary aided coeducational secondary, Church of England 11–16 voluntary aided school situated on the south coast of England in Eastbourne. The school has Specialist Mathematics and Computing College status.
The school offers a post-16 (sixth form) college and has an on-site nursery (3–5 years old).
Overview.
History.
Formerly Bedewell School on Whitley Road, Eastbourne, (the town's Fire Station now stands on the old site) it was reopened in its current location in Priory Road on 25 May 1959 by Princess Margaret. It is named after Bishop George Bell, who ordered its construction and of whom there is a painting in the school. The old site was commemorated with the addition of a Science and Technology building across the road from the main site, which is named Bedewell. The two sites are joined by a skywalk which cost £800,000 in 2004, replacing an outdoor metal bridge which had been deemed impractical.
There have been several ecclesiastical visits from Bishops and members of the Christian faith. The school has had visits from the Quicken Trust, a Christian organisation which works with people in Kabubu, Africa. Bishop Bell has links with Schlenker Secondary school from Freetown, Sierra Leone, within which it helped to implement an IT centre in 2008.
Performance.
Following a period of poor performance, the school's educational achievement improved when Terry Boatwright became head teacher in 1995. There was an increase in pupils achieving 5 A*-C grade GCSEs, which rose for eleven consecutive years. By 1999 it was one of the top improving schools in the country; this was attributed to Boatwright by the local MP. By 2006 the school was oversubscribed.
Curriculum.
The school educates students from Year 7 through to Year 11, after which they may continue their education within limited post-16 positions in ICT and the school nursery. The school offers pupils a range of voluntary and compulsory GCSE subjects which are taken from Year 9 to Year 11. This is a change from the previous academic year (2007–2008) in which the school started GCSEs at Year 10, with pupils deciding their subject choices the year before.
The school educates all of its pupils in Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health Education. English, Mathematics and Science, the core subjects, are taught to all students throughout the entirety of the pupils' education at the school. The arts and foreign languages are optional as GCSEs in the upper school.
School day.
The day comprises five one-hour periods, with breaks at 11.15 and 1.40. Mondays are shorter than the rest by twenty minutes to allow for pupil mentoring meetings at the end of the day.
Once every term (of which there are six in an academic year) there is an 'Academic Development Day' in which the school is divided up to partake in single subjects for the entire day. This time may be used to plan school trips, or sports days, or to complete coursework in the upper school.
Global Awareness group.
This group has been active in many areas of modern ethical concern, including fairtrade goods and global education, for example the 'Send my friend to school' campaign and the subsequent 'My friend needs a teacher' campaign. The group undertook to make the school a 'fairtrade school' by encouraging fair trade use within the school; in 2009, they succeeded.
Child sexual abuse.
The school has been at the centre of three major child safeguarding problems, including a child sexual abuse scandal:

<doc id="18345516" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18345516" title="Peter L. Gluck">
Peter L. Gluck

Peter L. Gluck is principal of GLUCK+ (formerly Peter Gluck and Partners), an architecture firm based in New York City since 1972. A monograph of his work, "The Modern Impulse", was recently published by ORO Editions. Gluck has designed buildings ranging from hotels, schools, university buildings and affordable housing to churches, houses, corporate interiors and historic restorations. Many of his projects regularly win national and international design awards and have been published in architectural journals and books in many countries.
Education.
Gluck received his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1962. He received his Masters in Architecture at the Yale School of Architecture studying under dean Paul Rudolph (architect), and noted architects James Stirling (architect), Shadrach Woods and Henning Larson. The influence of Louis Kahn who served as a design critic and professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957 was also still deeply felt. Toward the end of his program the "Yale Building Project" was initiated. A shift in the focus of learning to direct experience and away from the drafting room coincided with a design-build culture which already existed at Yale. "The design-build culture was largely initiated by two members of the class of 1965, David E. Sellers and Peter Gluck. In 1963, Sellers helped Gluck to build a vacation house for Gluck's parents in Westhampton, New York. A cedar-clad house which was supported on telephone poles took two summers to build and was featured in a 1967 article in Progressive Architecture which described the young Gluck as "plunging headlong into architecture--designing, building and developing."
Early work.
After graduation in 1965, Gluck purchased land in Vermont with the intention of building his own designs—a manifestation of the entrepreneurship that educator Denise Scott Brown has described as characteristic of Yale architecture students during the nineteen-sixties. Gluck purchased near Warren, Vermont, for which he designed vacation condominiums that were actually erected a few years later in a nearby town, Bolton.
The 4 four-bedroom cluster housing units built in Bolton were partially pre-fabricated with the complicated outer form of the building broken down into component wall panels which were made in a local carpentry shop. "The real value of prefabrication in this case" says Gluck, "lies in getting the product fast and getting it when you want it, and maintaining quality control". It is also a way of betting a rather complex building gets built at all, in areas of the country where builders will either refuse to bid such a job or automatically figure it at a premium because of its unfamiliarity. This early goal of saving both time and money for clients and developers in an integrated design-build method is one that Gluck will carry through the rest of his work.
After designing a series of houses from New York to Newfoundland, Gluck went to Tokyo to design large projects for Takenaka Komuten Co., LTD a leading Japanese construction consortium. This experience influenced Gluck's later work both in his knowledge of Japan's traditional aesthetics and of its efficient modern methods of integrated construction and design.
In the 1970s and 1980s Gluck designed projects of all types including the Marriot Casa Marina (Key West, Florida), Ojai Valley Inn (Ojai, California), Trancas Medical Center (Napa, California) work for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Technimetrics Inc., Lloyd's Bank International in New York, in addition to many private residences.
In 1986 Gluck designed an addition to Uris Hall at Columbia University's School of Business. The original building, completed in 1964, was an eight-story glass and aluminum tower that had widely drawn sharp criticism since its inception. A 30,000 sf three-story addition designed by Gluck provided the building with a new entrance, classrooms, offices, a recruiting center plus student and faculty lounges and preserved something of the original McKim, Mead and White plan. The new facade brought Uris Hall into scale with the original plan and the use of limestone blended naturally with the Low Library directly in front of it.
In the end, perhaps the most pleasing thing about the new addition is the restraint and sense of decorum it exhibits. Indeed, despite its calculated historical resonances, the new Uris Hall addition remains a frankly Modernist building, though one that now acknowledges and defers to its surroundings.
During the years 1986-1989 Gluck designed the addition of guest quarters, an entertainment space and a pool to a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe house in Connecticut. His design, while clearly in the manner of Mies, incorporates elements that are fresh as well as deferential. In trying to "out-Mies Mies" the project grew technically more challenging so that in the end Gluck took on the role of contractor himself. The influence of Japanese style is evident in Gluck's work, as he created systems of panels which are reminiscent of the movable walls in traditional Japanese architecture. Also, dropping the ceilings and raising the floors within the pavilions by several inches are also classic Japanese devices for defining space. In the end "Gluck succeeded in producing work in the manner of Mies that transcends an exercise in imitation or role playing. It succeeds by not being exactly Mies while always being about Mies, an absorbing gloss in steel and glass. It's exactly the deference the master deserves".
Work.
Gluck's dedication to the idea that the architect must take responsibility for the architectural process from conception to construction assuming oversight of all aspects of design led to the establishment of ARCS Construction Services, Inc. Together with Peter Gluck & Partners, ARCS provides a wholly integrated construction management service performed by the same team who have designed the buildings. This process of design and construction management completely permeates the thinking at Peter Gluck & Partners so that in cases where ARCS is not the construction manager, the benefits of construction knowledge informs the designs and benefits the client.
His recent architect-led-design-build projects include The East Harlem School and an Affordable Housing project in Aspen.

Christopher James "Chris" Bolder (born 19 August 1982 in Hull, England) is an English footballer who plays as a midfielder for Northern Premier League Division One South side Scarborough Athletic.
Bolder played in the Football League for Grimsby Town between 2001 and 2004. He came through the youth ranks at Hull City and has also appeared for Ossett Town and Guiseley as well as notably spending seven seasons in two spells with North Ferriby United.
Career.
Grimsby Town.
Bolder and brother Adam were part of the junior setup at Hull City, and both left the club at a young age to pursue career's in the higher divisions. Chris left Hull in the summer of 2001, to sign a professional contract with Grimsby Town, who at the time were several divisions higher than Hull. He made the move to Blundell Park with fellow City youngster Graham Hockless, and the pair slotted into the club's reserve squad. Bolder failed to make an appearance in his first season with The Mariners, and did not make his debut until nearly 18 months later playing against his brothers team Derby County in a 3–1 victory on Boxing Day 2002. He went on to make a handful of appearances that season but was unable to help Grimsby in there relegation battle, and they dropped down into the Second Division. He was to make only seven showings the following season and was released in May 2004 following another relegation.
Non-league.
His next port of call was Non League outfit Ossett Town, which is seen as a considerable step down from the professional game into the lower breaches of semi-professional and amateur football. After a season with Ossett, he joined fellow Hull and Grimsby team mate Graham Hockless in joining up with North Ferriby United in the summer of 2005. Bolder played three seasons with Ferriby.
Bolder joined Guiseley in September 2008. Bolder's contract expired at the end of the season and left the club in May 2009. After weighing up his options he returned to North Ferriby United 10 months after leaving the club. Bolder spent seven seasons in total with Ferriby and eventually left the club in May 2013 and signed for Scarborough Athletic.
Personal life.
Bolder is the younger brother of fellow footballer Adam Bolder.

Paris Indian Society

The Paris Indian Society was an Indian nationalist organisation founded in 1905 at Paris under the patronage of Madam Bhikaji Rustom Cama, B.H. Godrej and S. R. Rana. The organisation was opened as a branch of the Indian Home Rule Society founded that same year in London under the patronage of Shyamji Krishna Varma.
The Paris Indian Society also saw active participation from Indian nationalists who at various times were associated with the India House during its short existence. This included Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Har Dayal, M.P.T. Acharya and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Other prominent Indians associated with the society included P.O. Mehta, H.M. Shah, P.C. Varma and a number of other prominent Indians in Paris at the time. The Paris Indian Society, under the strong leadership of Madam Cama, developed close links with the Socialist Party and Russian socialists in exile in Paris, and Cama herself attended the Socialist Congress of the Second International at Stuttgart in 1907, where seconded by Henry Hyndman, she demanded recognition of selfrule for India. It was at this congress that Cama famously unfurled one of the first Flag of India.
Following the liquidation of the India House in the wake of Curson Wyllie's assassination in 1909 by Madanlal Dhingra, the PIS became the refuge and hub of Indian revolutionaries who fled England. The Paris Indian Society at this time grew to be one of the most powerful Indian organisations outside India at the time, and grew to initiate contacts with not only French Socialists, but also those in continental Europe. It sent delegates at this time to the International Socialist Congress in August 1910. At the time of V.D. Savarkar's rearrest at Marseilles following his escape during deportation from England, this socialist network was successfully able to exert pressure on the French government to press for Savarkar's extradition to France before the International Tribunal at Hague ruled in favour of Britain. In Paris, the Indian Society also held regular meetings and sought to train its members in skills necessary for revolution, which included training in firearms, learning military tactics, as well as organising the publication of revolutionary literature. It also sent recruits other countries and, after training, some were sent back to India to carry on propaganda work The Paris Indian Society produced the "Bande Mataram" from 1909, and Madam Cama later financed the "Talvar" to be produced in Berlin.

<doc id="18345642" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18345642" title="Behavioral addiction">
Behavioral addiction

Behavioral or behavioural addiction (as opposed to chemical addiction), also referred to as soft addiction, process addiction, or non-substance-related addiction, is a form of addiction not caused by the usage of drugs. Behavioral addiction consists of a compulsion to repeatedly engage in an action until it causes negative consequences to the person's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being. Behavior persisting in spite of these consequences can be taken as a sign of addiction.
Definition.
The ICD-10 of the World Health Organization does not single out behavioural addictions as an independent spectrum of mental disorders. Its recognition among psychiatrists is supposed to be hampered by the fact that the aetiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of the whole variety of addictive behaviour patterns are as yet undetermined. As a rule, different scientists tackle with different deviations, with the consequence that the results obtained include but fragments of information concerning particular forms of addiction. Few, if any, complex and methodologically validated studies have been made of addiction as such. The very concept of behavioural addiction is to be explicated. Research workers point out the lack of a definition of addiction which is scientifically useful.
Current investigations set out to clarify definitions and devise a diagnostic system. Patrick Carnes attaches paramount importance to a pathological relationship with a mood-altering experience. Aviel Goodman indicates that Carnes’s formulation represents an advance from earlier definitions because it implies that the basis of addiction is not a substance or a behaviour but an alteration of the emotional state. And yet this approach is susceptible to the criticism. Unless Carnes’s definition is followed by a specific definition of “pathological relationship,” it does not provide enough information to be useful in a scientific context. While sharing the advantages of Carnes’s definition, A. Goodman endeavours to propose diagnostic criteria specified in a format similar to that of DSM. He defines addiction as a disorder in which a behaviour that can function both to produce pleasure and to provide escape from internal discomfort is employed in a pattern characterized by:
Tsezar Korolenko who was the first to suggest a classification of non-chemical dependencies in Russia characterises addictive behaviour as the tendency to escape from reality by means of changing one’s mental condition.
Behavioral addiction, which is sometimes referred to as impulse control disorders, are increasingly recognized as treatable forms of addictions.
The type of behaviors which some people have identified as being addictive include gambling, food, sex, viewing of pornography, use of computers, playing video games, use of the internet, work, exercise, spiritual obsession (as opposed to religious devotion), cutting, and shopping.
When analyzing the addiction to food for example, a published study in 2009 from The Scripps Research Institute have shown for the first time that the same molecular mechanisms that drive people into drug addiction are behind the compulsion to overeat, pushing people into obesity. In this study, scientists focused on a particular receptor in the brain known to play an important role in vulnerability to drug addiction—the dopamine D2 receptor. The D2 receptor responds to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is released in the brain by pleasurable experiences like food or sex or drugs like cocaine.
Behavioral addictions has been proposed as a new class in DSM-5, but the only category included is gambling addiction. Internet gaming addiction is included in the appendix as a condition for further study.
The term "soft addiction" was coined by Judith Sewell Wright to describe activities, moods or ways of being, avoidances, and things - edible and consumable but which do not pose a grave health disease risk - rather, they have the most effect on personal time and productivity. These behaviors were profiled in a 2007 ABC News story titled Bad Habits.
On August 15, 2011 the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) issued a public statement defining all addiction in terms of brain changes. "Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry."
The following excerpts are taken from the FAQs: The new ASAM definition makes a departure from equating addiction with just substance dependence, by describing how addiction is also related to behaviors that are rewarding. This is the first time that ASAM has taken an official position that addiction is not solely "substance dependence." This definition says that addiction is about functioning and brain circuitry and how the structure and function of the brains of persons with addiction differ from the structure and function of the brains of persons who do not have addiction. It talks about reward circuitry in the brain and related circuitry, but the emphasis is not on the external rewards that act on the reward system. Food and sexual behaviors and gambling behaviors can be associated with the "pathological pursuit of rewards" described in this new definition of addiction. 
We all have the brain reward circuitry that makes food and sex rewarding. In fact, this is a survival mechanism. In a healthy brain, these rewards have feedback mechanisms for satiety or 'enough.' In someone with addiction, the circuitry becomes dysfunctional such that the message to the individual becomes ‘more’, which leads to the pathological pursuit of rewards and/or relief through the use of substances and behaviors. So, anyone who has addiction is vulnerable to food and sex addiction.
Since ASAM released its statement, and shortly before its release, additional new studies have come out on Internet addiction. They reveal the same fundamental brain changes seen in other addicts of drugs. Another 2011 study found that the risk of Internet addiction in men was about three times more than women. Researchers noted, Internet addiction is a psychosocial disorder and its characteristics are as follows: tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, affective disorders, and problems in social relations. Internet usage creates psychological, social, school and/or work difficulties in a person's life. Eighteen percent of study participants were considered to be pathological Internet users, whose excessive use of the Internet was causing academic, social, and interpersonal problems. Excessive Internet use may create a heightened level of psychological arousal, resulting in little sleep, failure to eat for long periods, and limited physical activity, possibly leading to the user experiencing physical and mental health problems such as depression, OCD, low family relationships and anxiety.
DSM or "Impulse control disorder".
There is disagreement as to the exact nature of behavioral addiction or dependency. However, the biopsychosocial model is generally accepted in scientific fields as the most comprehensive model for addiction. Historically, addiction has been defined with regard solely to psychoactive substances (for example alcohol, tobacco and other drugs) which cross the blood–brain barrier once ingested, temporarily altering the chemical milieu of the brain. However, "studies on phenomenology, family history, and response to treatment suggest that intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, problem gambling, pyromania, and trichotillomania may be related to mood disorders, alcohol and psychoactive substance abuse, and anxiety disorders (especially obsessive–compulsive disorder)."
In the case of pathological gambling, for example, the American Psychiatric Association has previously classified the condition as an impulse control disorder and not an addiction. However, the 5th edition includes it in the addictions section and not the impulse control group.
Neurobiology.
There are many similarities in the neurobiology of behavior and drug addictions. One of the most important discoveries of addictions has been the drug based reinforcement and, even more important, reward based learning processes. Several structures of the brain are important in the conditioning process of behavior addiction. One of the major areas of study includes the region, called the amygdala, which involves emotional significance and associated learning. Research shows that dopaminergic projections to the amygdala facilitate a motivational or learned association to a specific behavior. The cycle that is created is considered the dopamine reward system.
Dopamine neurons take a role in the learning and sustaining of many acquired behaviors. Research specific to Parkinson’s disease has led to identifying the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the immediate actions of dopamine. The most common mechanism of dopamine is to create addictive properties along with certain behaviors. There are three stages to the dopamine reward system: bursts of dopamine, triggering of behavior, and further impact to the behavior. Once electronically signaled, possibly through the behavior, dopamine neurons let out a ‘burst-fire’ of elements to stimulate areas along fast transmitting pathways. The behavior response then perpetuates the striated neurons to further send stimuli. The fast firing of dopamine neurons can be monitored over time by evaluating the amount of extracellular concentrations of dopamine through micro dialysis and brain imaging. This monitoring can lead to a model in which one can see the multiplicity of triggering over a period of time. Once the behavior is triggered, it is hard to work away from the dopamine reward system.
Behaviors like gambling have been linked to the newfound idea of the brain’s capacity to predict rewards. The reward system can be triggered by early detectors of the behavior, and trigger dopamine neurons to begin stimulating behaviors. But in some cases, it can lead to many issues due to error, or reward-prediction errors. These errors can act as teaching signals to create a complex behavior task over time.
Research.
It is estimated that at least 90% of Americans have at least one form of soft addiction in their lives. Nadine Kaslow, PhD, professor of psychology and behavioral sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, has commented on the issue, saying that while it is healthy to relieve stress with behaviors like drinking coffee and watching television, when they become habitual they become problematic to one's health and happiness.
Cyber-psychologist Kimberly Young, director of the Center for Online Addiction, has addressed Internet addiction as one of the most common types of "soft addictions". Young has likened excessive Internet use to pathological gambling.
While also, another "soft addiction" would be considered as texting, or repetitive behaviors such as.
Research around addictions and social media sites has been growing. The Retrevo company recently came out with research suggesting that there is an obsessiveness to the way people are checking their pages.

2007 Rink Hockey World Championship

The 2007 Rink Hockey World Championship was the 38th edition of the Rink Hockey World Championship, being held between 16 and 23 June 2007, in Montreux, Switzerland. It was disputed by 16 countries and saw Spain achieving his 13th title, after a 8–1 win over Switzerland, in the final. The event marked the first time Switzerland reached the final of the most important international roller hockey competition. It also marked the worst performance ever for Portugal, with a disappointing 6th place.
Format.
The competition was disputed by 16 countries, divided in four groups of 4 teams each one. Unsurprisingly, the four major National Teams, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Argentina were divided by the four groups and they all won them. The two highest classified teams of each group would qualify for the knockout phase, starting with the quarter-finals. The winners would face each others at the semi-finals and then would advance for the final. The losers played for the 3rd place award.
Every game lasted 40 minutes, divided in 2 parts of 20 minutes.

John McDonough (sports executive)

John McDonough (born 1953) is a sports executive who is perhaps best known for his two decades with the Chicago Cubs. In 2007, he left the presidency of the Cubs to become president of the Chicago Blackhawks. On June 1, 2011, McDonough was promoted to President and CEO of the Blackhawks. He specializes in the area of marketing.
Personal life.
McDonough is a lifelong Chicago area resident, graduating from Notre Dame High School in Niles, Illinois before matriculating to Saint Mary's University in Winona, Minnesota. McDonough and his wife Karen are parents of three children: Colleen, Ryan (Katie) and Michael.
Professional career.
Chicago Sting.
McDonough's first work as a sports executive was with the Chicago Sting, Chicago's franchise in the North American Soccer League (NASL). He served as General Sales Manager, and later as Vice President of Sales and Marketing. McDonough was also a member of the front office when the Sting won the 1981 NASL Soccer Bowl Championship.
Chicago Cubs.
McDonough spent 24 years with the Cubs (1983–2007). During his tenure with the team, the Cubs set numerous attendance records, setting an all-time mark in 2007, when McDonough was team president. In McDonough’s time as Cubs president, the franchise saw great success both on and off the field, winning the 2007 National League Central title. 
One of the major innovations McDonough is credited with is the annual "Cubs Convention" which gives fans a chance to meet and interact with coaches, players and licensed vendors. Debuting in 1985, this was the first event of its kind in sports and is now viewed as a prototype for professional team and league fan festivals. 
He also is credited with creating the role of "guest conductor", where celebrities, local heroes, and local high school sports champions are given the chance to lead the singing of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" during the seventh-inning stretch at Cubs home games. The promotion started in the wake of the death of broadcaster Harry Caray in 1998, and continues as a tradition today.
Chicago Blackhawks.
In 2007, McDonough left the Cubs and became president of the Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago's National Hockey League franchise. In his tenure with the team, the Blackhawks have moved quickly to revitalize the team’s profile and fan base, in what Forbes Magazine called “The Greatest Sports-Business Turnaround Ever.” Most importantly, the Blackhawks won the 2010 Stanley Cup championship, the franchise’s first since 1961, with McDonough guiding the organization, and another Stanley Cup title in 2013.
Upon his arrival to the Blackhawks, McDonough welcomed back Hall of Famers Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita and Tony Esposito as team ambassadors, and helped foster a landmark partnership with WGN Television and Comcast SportsNet which allowed all 82 regular-season games to be broadcast on television for the first time in team history. The Blackhawks also announced a partnership with Chicago’s WGN Radio 720 to become the team’s new radio broadcast rightsholder.
McDonough was also instrumental in bringing the NHL Winter Classic 2009 to Chicago, a contest which matched up the Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings in front of 40,818 at Wrigley Field on January 1, 2009. The game drew an 11.8 overnight rating and a 21 share on NBC in Chicago, making it the most-watched NHL game in almost 34 years.
The Blackhawks franchise has undergone an enormous transformation under McDonough’s leadership; since 2007, the team’s season ticketholder base has more than tripled, and the Blackhawks have sold out more than 250 straight home contests, leading the league in average attendance each season since 2008-09. In less than two years since McDonough’s arrival, the Blackhawks organization jumped from 118th (2007) to 16th (2010) in ESPN Magazine’s Ultimate Standings. The organization’s ranking marked the best among Chicago’s professional sports teams. In 2012, a survey of SportsBusiness Journal readers voted the Blackhawks the NHL team for which they'd most like to work.

The Anchorage (Kilmarnock, Virginia)

The Anchorage is a historic home located in Northumberland County, seven miles (NE) outside of Kilmarnock, Virginia, near to Wicomico Church, Virginia. It was built in 1749 as a 2 1/2-story home (original section which is still lived in) with a gambrel roof and then extended in the 1840s, including basement foundation. An annex building of 1.5 rooms which was built also in the mid-19th century, was moved and attached to the house in the 1930s. The original section of the house was then extended in the rear in the mid 1980s. There are five fireplaces, three of which are part of the original chimney.
In over 260 years, the home has only had a handful of owners. The current owners, The Byrne Family, are on the 3rd generation, having owned the home since the 1920s. The original property (originally called "Road View") was approximately and sits on Mill Creek which feeds off of the Chesapeake Bay. The dock is situated in Kent Cove, which runs approximately 100 yards off of the Creek. At the entrance of the woods is the Kent family cemetery which dates back through the Civil War, inclusive of a CSA (Confederate States of America) Memorial tombstone and Grave.
The property is complemented by rolling orchards and woods sitting on Mill Creek with approximately of waterfront acreage. The barn lot has a corn crib and additional barns dating back to the 1840s. The property which was originally a tobacco farm, is situated in Ball's Neck in the Northern Neck of Virginia, rich in early colonial history. Mary Ball Washington was born only a few miles away in Lively, and Richard Lee I ("The Immigrant" was Robert E. Lee's GGG Grandfather) emigrated from England in 1639 and had a large tobacco plantation ("Ditchley") of approximately on property approaching The Anchorage.
It was registered as an historic landmark by the Virginia Landmarks Register (Virginia Department of Historic Resources) in Virginia by the Byrne Family in 1995. It also appears on the National Register of Historic Places.

Overview.
The song was the first number-one single for Southern All Stars since the 1996 single "Ai no Kotodama" on the Oricon weekly charts.

American Idols LIVE! Tour 2005

American Idols Live! Tour 2005 was a summer concert tour in the United States featuring the top 10 contestants of the fourth season of "American Idol", which aired in 2005. It was sponsored by Kellogg Pop-Tarts. It followed in the tradition of other "American Idol" summer tours following the completion of each season in May. After the poor attendance of the tour the previous year, the tour was scaled down somewhat. Forty dates were initially planned, four more dates were however later added. An extra show was further added at the end of the tour as a benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina which struck Mississippi two weeks earlier.
Before the Las Vegas show, runner-up Bo Bice came down with serious stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a blockage in his intestines, and received emergency surgery. He returned for the last two shows of the tour in Syracuse, New York. Bice also broke his foot on stage earlier in the tour at Manchester.
Show overview.
Shows from this year's tour differed significantly from the previous three tours. Each performer performed their own set of two to three songs to showcase their differing talent. Unlike previous years, ensemble singing was more limited. There were only a few duets in addition to the obligatory final group performance which consisted of two songs in this tour. The individual sets started off with tenth-place finisher Jessica Sierra and ending with the winner Carrie Underwood, but those in between did not performed in elimination order. The first half of the show ended with Nadia Turner's set, and the second half began with a duet between Anwar Robinson and Vonzell Solomon.
Bo Bice was absent throughout most of the later part of the tour due to his serious nature of his illness, and this necessitated modifications and re-arrangement to the tour set list. Extra songs were added by some singers, and a group performance by the male singers was also added.
Setlist.
"Intermission"
Response.
The tour returned to form after the dismal Season 3 tour. Excluding the sold-out Hurricane Katrina benefit show, the average attendance was at 89% capacity, with 12 of the 43 shows sold out. Excluding the last charity show in Syracuse, the revenue from ticket sales totalled $17,364,290 million with 392,094 tickets sold according to Billboard.

Juan Carlos Da Costa

Juan Carlos Da Costa (born 1944 in Asunción, Paraguay) was a writer, politician, activist and leader of the OPM (Political Military Organization) clandestine movement, created in the mid 1970s, against General Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship. He died fighting the police, on April 3, 1976.
Youth and studies.
Born in 1944, he was the child of a Bolivian woman who married Juan Da Costa, a Paraguayan citizen that took her to Asunción to live with him. Juan Carlos Da Costa studied in the Colegio Nacional de la Capital, from which he was expelled in 1956, for being too much of a “troublemaker”. During his youth, he had was briefly active in the Liberal Party. His literary knowledge led him to contribute to some cultural magazines like "Pendulum" and "Criterion".
He was imprisoned for the first time in August 1967, when he was determined to create a clandestine organization of resistance to then-president Stroessner’s dictatorship. Alfredo Stroessner had become the president of the Republic of Paraguay in 1954, through a coup d'état. In that time, Da Costa was brutally tortured and remained there until 1971 when he was deported to Argentina. Once he got there, he didn’t desist with the idea of creating an organization that could start a revolution in Paraguay.
Exile.
In Argentina, Da Costa established many relations with socialist organizations, mostly with Montoneros. In 1973, after Salvador Allende's victory, he traveled to Chile and met with leaders of the Unidad Popular and the Revolutionary Left Movement. During those years, he began to live with Nidia González Talavera, who would be his companion during the rest of the revolution attempt. In 1974 he entered Paraguay clandestinely, where he began contacting and organising the first members of the organization that would become the OPM. The movement defined its political view as "revolutionary nationalism", a euphemism of a Leninist movement, which was willing to use guerrilla warfare to fight the dictatorship.
The OPM.
His leadership and constant planning, were fundamental to the growth of the organization in the capital and in certain farmer groups, most of them associated in the past with the Ligas Agrarias Cristianas movement. During the next few years, the OPM grew unexpectedly; in fact, so unexpectedly that it had more militants than his poor security system would allow it. The organization even military trained a small group of his members not heavily armed. It never really did anything, even though in the first few months of 1976 the organization counted with a group of leadership that was composed by a small number of Paraguayans students that studied in Corrientes, Argentina.
His death.
In March 1976, one of the students, Carlos Brañas, was caught by the border police in Encarnación, surprising the OPM and even the police. After investigating him, the police found out about the OPM and its members. In the next days, the government replied with a repression extremely harsh in which every revolutionary found lead to the next one. Finally, the night of April 4, the police arrived at a house located in a neighborhood called Herrera, in Asunción. There, Juan Carlos Da Costa, Mario Schaerer Prono and his wife, Guillermina Kannonikoff, important leaders of the OPM, were found. Once the police entered the property, they started to shoot the house and Da Costa died, but not before shooting the police commissioner, Alberto Buenaventura Cantero, in the chest. Shaerer Prono and Kannonikoff escaped through the back door of the house and hid in a school that was nearby, where they both used to teach. However, a priest decided to turn them in to the police, with the promise that they wouldn't be tortured. Years later, information from the Archives of Terror established that the police had lied to the priest and the prisoners were in fact tortured. Mario Shaerer Prono was tortured to death, in the department of Investigations and Guillermina, his wife, gave birth to their son during her imprisonment.
The painful easter.
The repression against the OPM continued during the next weeks, taking the lives of twenty people and more than 1,500 people in jail. Most of them didn’t even know what the OPM was. The press called it the "Painful Easter".
The repression against the OPM was the biggest one during the dictatorship of Stroessner. The name of Juan Carlos Da Costa remained in the collective unknown, and just a few men knew his attempt to establish a revolution in the country until the discovery of the Terror Archives in 1992. Those secret documents showed all the horrors perpetrated by the police, including massive repressions and tortures but it also showed the great number of Paraguayans heroes that gave their lives to fight for their freedom and the freedom of the land in which they were born.

1919–20 Montreal Canadiens season

The 1919–20 Montreal Canadiens season was the team's 11th season and third as a member of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Canadiens opened their new Mount Royal Arena built to replace burnt-down Jubilee Rink.
The Toronto NHL franchise was now operated by a new group and known as the Toronto St. Patricks. A Quebec team was active this season, meaning a four-team league operated, and players from the Quebec NHA team were 'returned' to the new Quebec Bulldogs NHL team. The Canadiens lost Joe Malone and Jack McDonald to the Bulldogs.
Harry Cameron joined the Canadiens from Ottawa and Howard McNamara re-joined the Canadiens after not playing since 1917 with the Toronto 228th Battalion, and serving in the Canadian army. Don Smith, who had last played for the Canadiens in 1914–15, returned after serving in the army, last playing for the Montreal Wanderers in 1915–16.
Regular season.
The Mount Royal Arena was not ready for the start of the season, and the Canadiens started their season on the road. The home opener was held January 10, and Newsy Lalonde used the occasion to celebrate with six goals in a 14–7 drubbing of the Toronto St. Patricks.
On March 3, the Montreal Canadiens pummeled the Quebec Bulldogs 16–3, setting an all-time
record for goals by one team.
Georges Vezina came third in the league in goals against average of 4.66 per game. Newsy Lalonde led the Canadiens in offence, scoring 37 goals and 9 assists to place second in league scoring to Joe Malone.
The Canadiens picked up their scoring from the previous season, but gave up more goals on defence and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1914–15 season.
Playoffs.
There was no playoffs as the Ottawa Senators won both halves of the season.

Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008

The Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 (c. 15) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was a piece of emergency legislation and was introduced by the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, in order to overturn the judgement of the House of Lords in "R v Davis" and permit the use of anonymous witnesses in criminal trials in special circumstances.
Provisions.
The Act abolished the existing common law rules on anonymity of witnesses and replaced them with a framework in which "witness anonymity orders" would be granted by the Court on the application of the prosecutor or defendant. Section 2 of the Act set out the terms which could be included in such orders, such as withholding of identity, protection from certain types of questioning, and also authorises visual screening of the witness from the defendant (but not from the judge, jury or any interpreter required by the witness). Section 4 set out the conditions which had to be satisfied before an anonymity order could be made; they were
The Act contained a sunset clause which stated that the Act would expire on 31 December 2009 (although Parliament could authorise extensions of 12 months at a time). This was because of the emergency nature of the bill, and because Parliament was already expected to debate a new criminal justice bill before the Act expired, in which further attention was to be given to the law on anonymous witnesses.
The Act was replaced by sections 86 to 97 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 96 repealed most of the 2008 Act. These sections came into force on 1 January 2010.
Criticism.
Geoffrey Robertson, QC argued that the Act was a "perjurer's charter," describing the proposed changes as "the most serious single assault on liberty in memory." He wrote 
He further argued that Jack Straw's statement that the Bill conformed with the European Convention on Human Rights was incorrect:
Legislative history.
"R v Davis" was decided by the House of Lords on 18 June 2008. The bill to overturn the Lords' judgement was introduced by Justice Secretary Jack Straw on 4 July 2008. The bill received its third reading in the House of Commons on 8 July and a third reading in the House of Lords on 15 July. On 16 July, the Commons approved the Lords Amendments. The bill became effective upon royal assent, which it received on 21 July.

History.
Company history.
In 1940 José Navarro, Sr. founded Navarro Discount Pharmacies in Havana, Cuba. The first store was located on Monte Street and had a large client base including the employees of the Power Company of Cuba. Years later, with the success of the first store, Navarro opened a second store. 
After the political change in Cuba in 1961, the government confiscated the Navarro stores, forcing the family to flee to the United States. Upon arriving in Miami, José Navarro, Sr. cashed an insurance policy and used the $4000 to open a pharmacy on S.W. 8th Street and 13th Avenue, in what would become the heart of Miami’s Little Havana.
2007 expansion.
While the founding Navarro family still holds 40% of the drugstore chain, the family ceded control of the company to investment firm MBF Healthcare Partners in 2007. In mid-2007 Navarro entered into an agreement to combine its operations with Sedano's Pharmacy. The two formed 31 stores, and operate under the Navarro brand name. As of 2010 there are a total of 28 stores.. As a result, Navarro is currently the 18th largest Hispanic-owned company in the United States and the sixth largest in Florida.

Positive deconstruction

Positive deconstruction, in relation to Christian apologetics, is a term first used by Nick Pollard in "Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult" (drawing on Dr. David Cook), to describe a methodology for engaging with worldviews in Christian apologetics. The process is one of "deconstruction" because it involves 'dismantling' the worldview in order to identify areas of conflict with a Christian worldview. It is "positive" because the intention is not to destroy a person's ideas and belief system, but to build on areas of agreement between the two worldviews in order to argue for the truth of the Christian worldview.
Pollard identifies four key aspects:
Tony Watkins develops this in relation to film in "Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema". He aims to make the positive deconstruction process more accessible, and accordingly re-labels the four aspects of the process (pp. 31–45):

Curtis Eller

Curtis Paul Eller (born 1970, Detroit, Michigan) is a banjo player, yodeler and songwriter based in New York City. 
Eller's work has an old-time feel, drawing on an abundance of direct or indirect influences from the first half of the 20th Century, combined with a modern perspective and a healthy dose of rock & roll energy. Many of the lyrics deal with American politics both historical and contemporary. He got an early introduction to show business when his father ran the Hiller Old Tyme Circus in Detroit, Michigan.
The songwriting draws on many historical people and events but addresses contemporary American culture. Lyrical subjects have ranged from pigeon racing and performing elephants to sweatshop fires and presidential assassinations and the Hartford circus fire of 1944. Historical figures as diverse as Buster Keaton, Abraham Lincoln, Amelia Earhart, Joe Louis, Jack Ruby, and Elvis Presley appear in the lyrical content. 
An excellent and highly intriguing singer/songwriter who is based in New York City, Curtis Eller has successfully brought a variety of influences to his unorthodox folk-rock vision. The banjo-playing Eller's work has an old-time feel, drawing on an abundance of direct or indirect influences from the '20s, '30s, and '40s (including country singer Jimmie Rodgers, cowboy icon Gene Autry, and Mississippi Delta bluesman Robert Johnson). But Eller's material is far from a carbon copy of music from that era -- there is plenty of rock bite and attitude in his rootsy work, which also contains elements of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and the ballsy outlaw country of Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard. Eller, consciously or unconsciously, reminds listeners what Dylan, Cash, Son House, Pete Seeger, and Haggard have in common -- they are all known for being effective storytellers, and storytelling is where Eller himself shines. --Alex Hederson (Allmusic)
Eller has released three full length CDs and a one EP with his band Curtis Eller's American Circus. [ 1890] (2000), Banjo Music For Funerals (2002), [ Taking Up Serpents Again] (2004), [ Wirewalkers & Assassins] (2008). The recordings feature Eller on banjo & lead vocals and a backing band that consists of upright bass, drums, accordion, pedal steel, tuba, violin and lots of three part harmony.
Eller does away with the backing band and tours the US, Canada and Europe extensively as a solo act. In addition to the usual folk, punk and indie-rock clubs, he has appeared in numerous unusual venues, including funerals, horse races, vaudeville/burlesque revues. He has shared the stage with contortionists, strippers, glass-eaters and folksingers. The live performances are high energy, intensively physical events that have more than once landed Eller on crutches.
In 2010, Eller relocated to Durham, NC where he continues to record and perform regularly.

American Palestine Line

The American Palestine Line was a steamship company, formed in 1924 in the U.S., for the purpose of providing direct passenger service from New York to Palestine and was reportedly the first steamship company owned and operated by Jews. The company negotiated to purchase three ocean liners from the United States Shipping Board, but it was only able to purchase one, , a former North German Lloyd steamer that operated as "Princess Alice" before being seized by the United States during World War I. After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when "President Arthur" sailed on her maiden voyage. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and Yiddish. The company claimed that "President Arthur" was the first ocean liner to fly the Zionist flag at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers.
The line had labor difficulties and financial difficulties throughout its existence. On "President Arthur" 's first trip in 1925, rumors of a mutiny were reported in "The New York Times", and several crew members got into an altercation with members of the Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group, when the liner made an intermediary stop in Naples. On her second voyage, the ship's master-at-arms was killed by a fellow crew member. Financial difficulties included unpaid bills and resultant court actions as well as accusations of fraud against company officers that were leveled in the press. In late 1925 the company was placed in the hands of a receiver; "President Arthur"—after a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold—ended up back in the hands of the United States Shipping Board (USSB), and the company's office furniture and fixtures were sold at auction in early 1926.
Background.
The newly formed American Palestine Line, reportedly the first ever steamship company owned and operated by Jews, began working to institute direct passenger service from New York to Palestine. To that end, the company began negotiations with the United States Shipping Board (USSB) to purchase three former German ocean liners, sister ships and and the smaller . On October 9, 1924, the American Palestine Line's president—Jacob S. Strahl, a New York Supreme Court justice—announced the purchase of "President Arthur" from the USSB, with plans to begin the Palestine service the following March. Strahl also publicly announced American Palestine's intent to acquire "President Fillmore" at the same time; plans 
for that acquisition and that of "Mount Clay", however, never materialized.
The ship.
SS "President Arthur" was formerly "Kiautschou", a launched in September 1900 for the Hamburg America Line's Far East passenger and mail service. When Hamburg America withdrew from the service, the liner was traded to North German Lloyd, and regularly used—under the new name of "Princess Alice"—on both North Atlantic and Far East passenger routes. The liner was interned in the U.S.-controlled Philippines at the outset of World War I and was seized upon the American entry to the conflict. The ship was used as a transport ship for both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army under the name "Princess Matoika". After some post-war use as a passenger liner and yet another name change—this one in honor of the 21st U.S. President, Chester A. Arthur—she was taken out of service when changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s. At the time of the purchase by American Palestine, the ship had been laid up in Baltimore since late 1923.
News reports the following month fixed the purchase price of "President Arthur" at $60,000 cash, plus assurances that the liner would be reconditioned within six months. Announced plans for reconditioning included reducing passenger capacity to 675 and increasing the cargo capacity to . Also on tap were swimming pools, a game room, a gymnasium, a lecture hall, a social hall, and a moving picture theater. The line had originally planned to change the name of the liner to "White Palace", but that was never brought about.
After undergoing reconditioning at Morse Dry Dock & Repair in Brooklyn, "President Arthur" was taken out for a shakedown cruise on March 7, 1925. Steaming off the New Jersey coast, "President Arthur", expected by American Palestine officials to top out at , reached a reported maximum cruising speed of , which company officials claimed would reduce her travel time to Palestine by two or three days. At the end of the shakedown, the liner was docked at the foot of West Houston Street in preparation for her maiden voyage five days later.
The acquisition of "President Arthur" by American Palestine inspired Jewish lyricist Solomon Small to pen the song "President Arthur's Zion Ship" which contained these lines in its refrain:
Palestine service begins.
On the morning of March 12, 1925, crowds started gathering at "President Arthur" 's pier at 7:00 a.m. By the time the ceremonies—broadcast by New York's municipal radio station, WNYC—opened with the singing of both "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Hatikvah", the crowd had swelled to 15,000 in number. The festivities included speeches and prayers from Orthodox Rabbi Morris S. Margolies; David Yellin, Vice Mayor of Jerusalem, who addressed the crowd in Yiddish; Rabbi David de Sola Pool; and Rabbi Stephen S. Wise. Cantor Josef Rosenblatt sang to the crowd and a telegram from New York merchant Nathan Straus, unable to attend the event, was read aloud. American Palestine Line president Jacob S. Strahl, in his remarks, made the claim that the sailing of "President Arthur" marked the first appearance "in more than 2,000 years of the flag of Judea on the high seas".
The ship, with Stars of David painted on her funnels, pulled away from the dock at eight minutes before noon, nearly an hour later than her planned departure time, and headed to Haifa, with an intermediate stop in Naples. On board were some 400 passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount Scopus by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. "President Arthur" also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.
Herman Hirsch, a Jew from Chicago on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, kept an account of "President Arthur" 's maiden voyage. On Friday, March 13, one day into the voyage, Hirsch reported that the torah was dedicated and a procession to songs and music accompanied a march over all parts of the ship. Afterwards, Rabbi Aaron Ashinsky of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, officiated at a service held in a chapel provided for the passengers.
Newspapers published radio dispatches emanating from "President Arthur" throughout her maiden voyage, thanks to a powerful new radio set installed aboard the liner. On March 14 the liner was able to avoid the worst of a gale that slowed of the United States Lines, and on March 26 "President Arthur" was able to avoid a waterspout east of Gibraltar. At Gibraltar, the local Jewish community chartered a ship to escort "President Arthur" through the Mediterranean. The ship docked at Naples on March 27, four days later than her planned arrival there, and departed the same day.
The liner arrived at Haifa on March 31, nearly a week late. Herman Hirsch reported that a passenger from Chicago, Jacob Drapekin, 72, had died aboard the ship on March 24. The man's dying wish was to be buried in the Holy Land, and the crew of "President Arthur" helped fulfill his wishes. After arrival in Haifa, his flag-draped coffin was placed on deck and services were conducted in English and Hebrew by Rabbi Ashinsky before the body was taken ashore for interment. A sizable crowd, comprising delegations from Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Tel Aviv, greeted the arriving ship. Most of the passengers on "President Arthur" were hurried to Jerusalem for the Hebrew University dedication ceremony the next day.
"President Arthur" departed Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17. While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from "President Arthur" got into a confrontation with members of the Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000 bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000 cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500 well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the Jewish sabbath, but "President Arthur" was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship. Sources are unclear as to what actually happened aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.
On May 12 "President Arthur" sailed on her second voyage to Palestine, counting Hemda Ben-Yahuda, the widow of Hebrew linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, among her passengers. During the trip, an altercation between a Steward and the ship's master-at-arms resulted in the death of the latter while the ship was in Naples. Though the steward was arrested by Italian authorities, he was acquitted of murder by the Assize Court at Naples. After a return to New York, "President Arthur" sailed for Haifa on July 19 for what would be her last voyage for American Palestine.
The demise of American Palestine.
By this time, the company, perpetually undercapitalized by its own admission, faced mounting financial troubles. On July 10, the company had to post an indemnity bond to avoid the impoundment of "President Arthur" for a disputed bill owed to Morse Dry Dock for the ship's 1924 refit. The following month, "President Arthur" was used as collateral for $100,000 loan from a Bronx bank, but it was too little, too late. American Palestine Line was placed in receivership on September 11 by federal judge Thomas D. Thacher of the U.S. District Court after suit was brought by a creditor. Eight days later, "President Arthur", docked at the foot of West 34th Street, experienced a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold that brought out both land-based firefighters and the New York City Fire Department fireboat "James Duane". In December, the line was accused of fraud in some of its prior financial dealings, charges the company denied. By the time all the legal wrangling was finished, "President Arthur" was back in the hands of the USSB, and the furniture and fixtures of the American Palestine offices were sold at public auction by the company's receiver in early March 1926.

William Clyde Thompson

Captain William Clyde Thompson was a Texas Choctaw leader who rallied against the Dawes Commission for Choctaw enrollment. He was born in 1839 near Fort Towson in the Choctaw Nation.
Background.
William C. Thompson was born on February 6, 1839 at Fort Towson, Choctaw Nation. He was the son of William Thompson, who was one-fourth Choctaw and one-eighth Chickasaw, and Elizabeth Jones Mangum who was also one-eighth Choctaw, the great granddaughter of Nashoba. His family were part of the Yowani Choctaws, originally from the village of Yowani Indians east of the Chickasawhay River near present day Shubuta, Clarke County, Mississippi. Many of the Yowani's moved west into Louisiana and Texas, taking on the customs of their neighbors, to the point that many scholars have included the Yowani Choctaws as a part of the Caddo Confederacy, while others became part of the leadership of the Koasati or Coushatta a former part of the Creek Confederacy. It was this same Choctaw group that were listed as part of the Cherokees and Twelve Associated Tribes, in the Treaty of Bowles Village between the tribes and the Republic of Texas, concluded on February 23, 1836.
William was descended paternally from Atahobia (c.1750-c.1824)a full blood Choctaw who was at one time the husband of Sally McCoy a half blood Chickasaw and later wife of Chickasaw leader Major James Colbert (1768–1842). Atahobia was one, if not the primary leader of the Yowani's who moved into Texas following their petition of the Mexican government for permission to settle in the province in 1824. Prior to this, Atahobia was a signer of the Treaty of Doak's Stand in 1820, as one of the Chiefs and Headmen of the Choctaw.
In Texas the villages prior to 1837 were located east of the Trinity River in what was then Nacogdoches County, west of the U.S. (Louisiana) Border. After 1837 the villages were combined to form a single village on Attoyac Bayou in extreme southeastern Rusk County. By 1844, following the Treaty of Birds Fort, there were two villages, one near the Cherokees under the leadership of Chicken Trotter (Devireaux Jarrett Bell 1817-1866), in what would become the Mt. Tabor/Bellview Indian Communities in Rusk County and the second under the leadership of Woody Jones (grandson of Nashoba), located in Houston County near the border with Trinity County. The southern village dwindled to only a few individuals until 1881, when John Martin Thompson (Cherokee, grandson of Cherokee Nation Chief Justice, John Martin) opened mills in Trinity and Angelina counties near Woodlake and Diboll, thereby bringing a large number of Choctaws along with some Cherokees (Thompson's & Starr's) and Muscogee-Creeks (Berryhill's & Posey's) into the area.
William C. Thompson's family moved between the Choctaw Nation and the Texas Choctaw villages until 1840, when vigilantes seeking retribution against Indians (possibly Chicken Trotters Cherokees) who had killed three whitemen near Nacogdoches, fell upon the unsuspecting Choctaw village. From this attack, eleven Choctaw men, women and children were murdered. According to Dr. May and information from the Thompson-McCoy Choctaw Descendants Association, William's family was in the village at the time, forcing them to flee back to the Choctaw Nation. William's mother and infant sister died there on August 30, 1840, followed two days later by his father. Family speculation has led some to tie these deaths to the attack by Texians against the Choctaws, but no collaborating evidence has yet to be found.
The death of his parents led William and his brother Arthur James Thompson (1837–1884) to be sent west to live with their paternal grandmother Margaret (McCoy) Thompson (c.1774-c.1868), residing at a community known then as Virginia Hill near Fort Washita in the Chickasaw Nation. It was there they remained until their maternal grandfather William Mangum arrived and took them back to Mississippi where they would stay until the American Civil War. It should be noted that Margarets brother was Judge James A. McCoy, Supreme Judge of the Chickasaw Nation, thus Margaret's reason for living near Fort Washita. His daughter Lucy (1855–1891)later married Chickasaw Governor Robert Maxwell Harris (1850–1927).
American Civil War.
As the Civil War broke out, both William and his brother Arthur enlisted in the Simpson Fencibles as privates (Simpson County, Mississippi). His first experience in battle was at the battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded while charging Union fortifications. The injury wasn't serious enough to hamper him as he was back with his unit within two days. It was then that he was elected Captain of his company.
His next injury was much more serious, His skull was fractured by shrapnel in a fight at Fort Gibson, Cherokee Nation in May 1863. From this injury he was hopitalized for some time before he could reume his command. Later seeing action in the Atlanta campaign. During this period at a place called Peach Tree Creek, his company (H of the Mississippi 20th Regiment) were being detailed in support of Cowman's battery, when they encountered a regiment of Union troops. Without hesitation they charged the federals with fixed bayonets, eventually capturing some forty-seven. During the Atlanta campaign, he saw action several times before he accompanied General Hood back to Tennessee. There, at the Battle of Franklin he was shot in the thigh and captured by the federals. From the field he was taken to a Union prison hospital in Nashville where he would sit out the remaining years of the war. During his incarceration he was promoted by the Confederate States government, to the rank of Lietenant Colonel of a Mississippi regiment, which had formed following the consoldation of the 6th and 20th Mississippi regiments. Of further note, although he was promoted to Lietenant Colonel, he never used that title, but continued to desire to be called Captain to the day he died. His tombstone in the Marlow City Cemetery in Marlow, Oklahoma simply reads Capt. William C. Thompson.
From Nashville, Colonel Thompson was sent to Camp Chase, Ohio, then on to Baltimore, and finally by boat to Richmond, Virginia, where he was paroled a short time before the close of the war. He reached Simpson County, Mississippi on June 1, 1865 and immediately began his preparations to return to his family in Texas.
He reached Dallas County, Texas in December 1865, later living in Cherokee County, south of present day Troup, Smith County, near present day Overton and later in Trinity County. While living in Smith County near many of his cousins, both Choctaws and Cherokees, he became involved in the efforts to preserve the culture and lands that had been a part of the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. His paternal uncle Archibald Thompson (1791–1857) had settled there in 1851 and had taken the role of leadership among the Texas Choctaws. Following Archibald's death in 1857, the role of leadership went to Jeremiah Jones (1814–1963)a cousin of William's through his mothers line. William's intelligence and leadership experience was of great value to the Texas Choctaws, Cherokees and the neighboring McIntosh Party Creek Indians as well. His reputation among local Indians and non-Indians was one of dependability and trust worthiness. However, due to such kindness his efforts at opening a mercantile, were often less than glorious as he just couldn't turn down credit to those in a bad way. Sometimes leaders, tribal or otherwise, must say no. William had a problem with that. Thus the overall community ledership of what was known initially as the Mount Tabor Indian Community and later as the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands, was clearly in the hands of Jack Bell (John Adair Bell 1806-1860)who along with his brother Devireaux Jarrett Bell (known by his Indian name of Chicken Trotter) and members`of the Starr, Harnage, Watie and other prominent Cherokee families. (Note: The Texas Cherokees Cherokees and Associate Bands were officially formed as a` political organization in 1871 by Colonel William Penn Adair and Clement Neely Vann, both Cherokees and both former Mount Tabor residents) After all it had always been a Cherokee community, but the Yowani connections to the Bell, Adair and Thompson Cherokee families, made it the safest place in Texas for Indians to live following the blood baths of the early 1840s. Additionally following the war and his return to Texas, William took another step that would change his life forever. On May 29, 1867, he married Miss Sarah S. Estes, the daughter of Thomas Coleman Estes (b. 1811) and the former Elizabeth Darby (c.1815-c.1853). From this union three children were born; Arthur M. (1869–1926), Mary M. (b. 1862) who married William McNeece and William Clyde Jr. (1875–1921). The Estes family was not of American Indian ancestry but predominately English.
After leaving Smith County, William followed the work and money. Both were moving to Trinity County. John Martin Thompson (1829–1907)a distant cousin, the son of Benjamin Franklin Thompson(1803–1868) and his Cherokee wife Annie Martin (1810–1851), established new lumber mills in the county bringing a prosperity unknown in the "big thicket" before that time.
William, while living in Trinity County was elected the second probate clerk of the county, and later to the office of probate judge. In 1889 he left Texas for good, relocating first to Ardmore in the Chickasaw Nation and later moving to the new community of Marlow, where he would remain throughout the remainer of his life. Of his Thompson and Jones relatives, several would follow him north into the Chickasaw Nation. Among these were John Thurston Thompson (1864–1907), Martin Luther Thompson (1857–1946) and Robert E. Lee Thompson (1872–1959). William and John were elected by family members that had relocated into the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations as their formal representatives. Martin Thompson and Robert Thompson both stayed for a short period, but later returned to Texas. For Martin it was a good move. Oil was discovered on his land and at the time of his death, he was worth over $200.000. in 1946. Martin also would take the lead among the Choctaws in Texas, but keeping close to his Cherokee relatives. The exception to this was the continuing feud between Martin and Texas Cherokee and Associate Bands attorney George Fields over inclusion of the Choctaws in any litigations over treaty rights undertaken by the TCAB. In the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the George Fields papers contain briefs to be submitted to the United States Supreme Court. In those, the word Choctaw has been scratched off.
For William, being in the Chickasaw Nation would keep him busy trying to get his family enrolled as citizens by blood in the Choctaw Nation. The case went back and forth for years, with his name and that of all the Texas Choctaws stricken from the roll in March 1906. In February 1909 some seventy Texas Choctaws were restored to citizenship and included upon a re-instatement list. For those that returned to Texas, there was nothing.
William's never say die attitude made him a very good leader, not only among the Texas Choctaws but among non-Indians as well being elected Mayor of Marlow, Chickasaw Nation, I. T. (now Oklahoma) in 1901. Many of his descendants and the descendants of those whom he helped re-establish themselves in the western Chickasaw Nation still have him to thank for their current prosperity, from, car dealers, to farmers and doctors, William Thompson just would not give up.

Princeton University Department of Psychology

The Princeton University Department of Psychology, located in Green Hall, is an academic department of Princeton University on the corner of Washington St. and William St. in Princeton, New Jersey. For over a century, the department has been one of the most notable psychology departments in the country. It has been home to psychologists who have made well-known scientific discoveries in the fields of psychology and neuroscience (e.g., adult neurogenesis in primate brains, cognitive miser, bystander non-intervention, face-selective neurons in primate brains, feature integration theory, mental models theory, prospect theory).
The department's undergraduate and graduate programs are highly ranked and the department has developed a well-respected neuroscience program. The department has over forty faculty members, over forty graduate students, and over one hundred undergraduate students. The faculty have received numerous awards, which include a Nobel Prize, six Distinguished Contributions awards from the American Psychological Association, and three William James Fellow awards from the Association for Psychological Science (APS). Additionally, two faculty members have previously served as presidents of the APS, twelve faculty members are fellows of the APS, and four faculty members have been inducted into the National Academy of Sciences.
Since 2002, the department has been chaired by social psychologist Deborah Prentice.
History.
In 1893, fourteen years after Wilhelm Wundt founded the first psychology laboratory in the world, a Psychology Laboratory was built in Nassau Hall, the oldest building in the university, under the leadership of J. Mark Baldwin. In 1915, psychology received recognition in the title when the department was renamed Department of Philosophy and Psychology. It was not until 1920, however, that the Department of Psychology was established with Howard Warren as its first chairman. In 1924, Eno Hall was constructed to house the department. The building was named in honor of Henry Eno, the principal donor and research associate in psychology. Warren was also a donor, but he chose to keep his donation anonymous at the time. He commented that it was "the first laboratory in this country, if not in the world, dedicated solely to the teaching and investigation of scientific psychology." According to university president John Hibben, the laboratory was the realization of a dream that Warren had cherished for a long time.
University president James McCosh was primary professor of psychology in the early days of the department. Baldwin, who studied under both McCosh and Wundt, continued this tradition.
In 1963, the department relocated to Green Hall on the corner of Washington St. and William St. The building, which had been previously occupied by the School of Engineering, was redesigned by university alumnus Francis W. Roudebush for the use of the psychology and sociology departments.
In 1972, the Princeton Psychology Colloquium Committee, which schedules weekly speeches and discussions for psychology students, invited Richard Herrnstein, psychology professor at Harvard University to speak about the vision of pigeons. At the time, Herrnstein was the victim of serious criticism because he had written an article in which he argued that genetic differences would play an increasingly larger role in the determination of social status. Because Princeton's University Action Group, a radical student organization, threatened to sabotage the event on the grounds that Herrnstein was a racist, the Harvard professor canceled his appearance. Kamin asserted that "the climate in which [Herrnstein's] decision was made raises serious questions about freedom of speech."
Most of the department's graduates from the classes of 2004 to 2007 had placements in the faculties of research universities and post-doctoral positions. Thanks to a group of faculty and students who work across traditional disciplines and departments, interdisciplinary research and scholarship in the department has grown significantly since the end of the twentieth century.

The quality of the department's teaching and research has been recognized by several sources. The department's graduate program has been ranked fifth best in the United States by "U.S. News and World Report" ("USNWR"), and twelfth best in the United States by the National Research Council. "USNWR" ranked the department's behavioral neuroscience program and its social psychology program sixth and seventh best in the United States, respectively.
Graduate.
The graduate study is focused on systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, perception and cognition, personality and social psychology, and physiological psychology. It is a preparatory program for a Ph.D., which takes approximately five years to complete, and a career of scholarship in psychology. Every year, six doctoral degrees and eight master's degrees are awarded on average. Students in the university's M.D./Ph.D. program, run jointly with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, are also able to pursue their doctoral degree in the department.
Laboratory units are organized around the research programs of the faculty. These programs range from animal motivation and conditioning processes to decision making in human social groups, from neurophysiological mechanisms controlling basic drives to attributional processes in judging other individuals, from the sensory and perceptual roots of human cognition to concept formation and problem solving behavior in the child and adult, from the mathematical and computer techniques employed in research to the mechanisms of attitude formation and change.
Admission to the graduate program is highly competitive. The number of applications received by the department has risen steadily from 2003 to 2007 and, consequently, the admission rate has declined accordingly. In 2003, twenty out of 192 applicants were accepted. Though seventeen applicants were admitted to the program in 2007, the applicant pool had almost fifty more applicants than the applicant pool from four years earlier.
Men are better represented in the department's student body than in the student bodies of most psychology graduate programs in the United States. Women account for about half of the department's graduate student body, even though women made up 68 percent of the recipients of doctoral degrees in psychology in 2005. Gender representation notwithstanding, female graduate students in psychology programs may benefit from same-sex mentors in their departments. Whereas only 33 percent of faculty members in psychology departments in the United States are women, the Department of Psychology's faculty has a female representation of over 40 percent. Additionally, the department is one of two departments at Princeton University that has had women who have served as departmental chairs.
Nine percent of the department's graduate students are underrepresented minorities. In contrast, twelve percent of recipients of psychology doctoral degrees in 2005 were African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. However, the ethnic and racial diversity of the department's students is comparable to the diversity of the student body of the university's Graduate School. Eight percent of the university's graduate students are members of the three aforementioned underrepresented groups. To reduce minority underrepresentation in graduate school, the department's faculty and graduate students participate in the Princeton Summer Undergraduate Research Experience program, which seeks to encourage students from underrepresented groups to apply to and succeed in graduate school.
Program in cognitive psychology.
The department is "a presence in the burgeoning field of cognitive psychology." The research of the cognitive psychology program's faculty spans a wide set of issues within the study of cognitive processes that include cognitive control, memory, judgment and decision making, language processing, reasoning, and visual perception. The highly interdisciplinary quality of these topics of study results in research that is interactive and multifaceted. Most of the research is conducted at the intersection of fields like computer science and neuroscience.
Program in psychology and public policy.
Run jointly by the university's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Department of Psychology, the program was planned with the intent of being a “discipline plus” degree. The growing interest in the incorporation of psychology in law schools and public policy schools is another reason why the program was established. Such interest is evidenced by the fact that five members of the Department of Psychology's faculty have an additional appointment at the Woodrow Wilson School and the fact that the department is one of the sponsors of the Princeton Graduate Student Conference on Psychology and Policymaking.
Undergraduate.
Undergraduate students can concentrate in Psychology to receive an A.B. in the discipline. As part of the degree requirement, they must complete two junior research papers and a senior thesis under the supervision of the department's faculty members. Psychology is one of the most popular concentrations on campus. It is one of the seven concentrations that have more than one hundred concentrators and undergraduate student enrollment in the department continues to rise steadily. Every year, the department confers 58 undergraduate degrees on average.
Additionally, undergraduate students can enroll in the Program in Neuroscience, which encourages the study of molecular, cellular, developmental, and systems neuroscience as it interfaces with cognitive and behavioral research, to earn a Neuroscience Certificate.

Unless otherwise noted, a date indicates the year in which a Ph.D. was conferred.
Equipment and facilities.
The department is closely affiliated with the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior (CSBMB), which fosters research on the neural underpinnings of psychological function and plays a central role in the. Located in the basement of Green Hall, the CSBMB houses state of the art facilities for the study of brain function, including a research-dedicated, high-field fMRI scanner, an EEG laboratory, a TMS coil, an eye tracking laboratory, and high-performance computing facilities for data analysis and computational modeling. Seventeen faculty members from the department are affiliated with the CSBMB. Unique among research institutions that own and operate fMRI scanners, the CSBMB is the first facility to own a scanner that is run solely by neuroscientists that conduct basic research. Most scanners in the United States are located in clinical settings and are utilized primarily in applied research.
When the University unveiled its $1.75 billion capital campaign in 2007, it allocated $300 million to build a . headquarters for the department on a site of about . The psychology building, which would be in the shape of a half-circle cylinder, will consist of five floors above general ground level and one floor below ground level. The department will share this space with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The complex will house state-of-the-art labs, faculty offices, and classrooms in an attempt to push the university to the forefront of neuroscience and behavioral science research. Due to the economic environment, however, the construction of the new building has been postponed. The start date for the construction has been postponed until June 2010.
Psychology Library.
In 1963, the department moved to Green Hall; a room located next to the lobby in the first floor served as the department's academic library. In 1968, two more rooms were added to house monographs and journal stacks. In 1990, the third journal room was moved into the basement to accommodate compact shelving. The Psychology Library, a branch of Princeton University Library, underwent significant renovations in 2002. The basement room was no longer used because the library gained a Reading Room, which has become a popular study space for psychology concentrators. A ramp that leads to the second room was built to ease the reshelving of materials. A librarian’s office was built next to one of the computer clusters.
As of 2006, the Psychology Library contains a large collection of material. The library's collections will be moved to Lewis Library once the new psychology and neuroscience buildings are complete.

Theofrid

Saint Theofrid ("Chaffre, Theofredus, Theofred, Théofroy") of Orange (or "of Carmery") (d. 728 or 732 AD) was an abbot of Calmeliac or Carmery-en-Velay (later called Saint-Chaffre, and today Le Monastier-sur-Gazeille), situated near Le Puy-en-Velay and originally founded by Saint Calminius.
A native of Orange, he is venerated as a martyr, as Christian tradition holds that he was killed by Muslim raiders who had crossed into southern France. 
Tradition states that the circumstances of his death are as follows: when the raiders neared Calmeliac, Theofrid ordered the other monks to hide in the forest. He remained near the monastery and was found in prayer, and was dragged away and mortally wounded in the head with a stone. 
The legend further states that after Theofrid fell to the group, the earth shook and a dark storm cloud unleashed lightning, hail, and winds that dispersed the raiders. Theofrid died seven days later.
Veneration.
His cult spread in Southern France during the 11th century. In Piedmont, his cult was confused with that of the legendary member of the Theban Legion, Chiaffredo (Theofredus, Teofredo).

The Crowd Roars (1932 film)

The Crowd Roars is a 1932 film directed by Howard Hawks starring James Cagney and featuring Joan Blondell, Ann Dvorak, Eric Linden, Guy Kibbee, and Frank McHugh. 
The driver in the film's auto racing sequences was Harry Hartz, a successful board track and Indianapolis 500 race professional. It was remade in 1939 as "Indianapolis Speedway," with Pat O'Brien in Cagney's role, Ann Sheridan in Blondell's role, and McHugh playing the same role he played in the original.
Plot.
Motor racing champion Joe Greer (James Cagney) returns home to compete in an exhibition race featuring his younger brother Eddie, who has aspirations of becoming a champion. Joe's misogynistic obsession with "protecting" Eddie from "women" causes Joe to interfere with Eddie's relationship with Anne (Joan Blondell), leading to estrangement between Joe and Eddie, and between Joe and his longtime girlfriend Lee (Ann Dvorak), who is made to feel "not good enough" to be around Eddie.
During the race, a third driver, Spud Connors, wrecks and is burned alive. Driving lap after lap through the flames and the smell of burning flesh (and maybe past the burning body) while blaming himself for the accident, Joe loses his will to race. Eddie goes on to win. Afterward, Joe's career plummets as Eddie's rises. The power of love eventually triumphs and Joe's career and his relationships with Lee and Eddie are rehabilitated.
Sentimentalism is downplayed in this "pre-Code" film. The lingering stench of Spud's burning body is implied strongly by the horrified expression on each driver's face as he passes through the smoke and tongue of burning gasoline that marks the wreck site, sometimes pushing his scarf against his nose.

Jimmy Justice (musician)

James Anthony Bernard Little, better known by his stage name Jimmy Justice (born 15 December 1939, Bermondsey) was an English pop singer. He scored three Top 40 hits in the UK in 1962.
Biography.
As a young man, James Little befriended Dave and George Sweetman, who were stepbrothers of Emile Ford. Because of this, Little was occasionally invited to sing with The Checkmates, and was encouraged by Ford to start his own group. After competing in a talent show he was noticed by executives from EMI, but he eventually signed with Pye Records instead at the urging of Ford. His debut single, credited to "JJ & the Jury", was 1960's "I Understand". While "The Jury" was the name used for Justice's subsequent backing band, on this first recording he is backed by The Checkmates.
Despite the single's lack of success, Pye offered him a three-year recording contract. While visiting his girlfriend, who lived in Sweden, he sang in clubs and on radio and television, resulting in his first major exposure; eventually, he would score a major hit in Sweden with the tune "Little Lonely One", originally by The Jarmels. He remained in Sweden during the time that his records began to break in the UK, with three of them hitting the UK Singles Chart in 1962; "When My Little Girl Is Smiling" (#9, March), "Ain't That Funny" (#8, June), and "Spanish Harlem" (#20, August). His version of "When My Little Girl Is Smiling" had competition from both The Drifters original cut (UK #31) and Craig Douglas' cover (UK #9).
Because of his general absence in UK at the time his records hit the charts, he was unable to capitalize fully on his popularity in his home country. Meanwhile, Kapp Records picked up "When My Little Girl Is Smiling" for distribution in the U.S., where it peaked at #127. His records were also popular throughout continental Europe and in Australia.
Justice released two full-length albums in 1963 ("I Wake Up Crying" and "Justice for All!") but soon faded in the wake of the beat group explosion. The former included a cover of Clyde McPhatter's hit - "Since You've Been Gone".
In 2001, fifty of his Pye recordings were released on two compact discs by Castle Music.

Renewable Energy Systems

The RES Group (Renewable Energy Systems) is a UK-based renewable energy project developer. Its core business is to develop, construct and operate large-scale, grid-connected renewable energy projects worldwide. RES is active in the wind (onshore and offshore wind), wave and tidal, biomass, and solar energy sectors. It has been active in the wind energy industry for over 30 years and has now expanded in on-site and building-integrated renewables as well as in building design and consultancy.
RES is also an independent power producer, owning and operating a growing portfolio of wind farms around the world.
History.
Renewable Energy Systems was started in 1982 as part of the Sir Robert McAlpine group of engineering and construction companies. Its early years were spent in researching various designs for commercial wind turbines, including work on a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) model as well as the now more widely used horizontal axis (HAWT) units. The company built its first commercial wind farm at Carland Cross in Cornwall in 1992, using 15 Vestas turbines, each of 400 kW capacity. In December 1998, the first commercial 1MW wind turbine to be designed and built in the UK was installed by RES at Slievenahanaghan, Co Antrim. 
The RES Group has now developed and/or constructed over 100 wind farms worldwide, with more than 6.5GW of capacity. In addition, it has projects on its books totaling several thousand megawatts worldwide, at various stages of development.
The group will be managing the assets of the Renewables Infrastructure Group, a company involved in onshore wind and solar energy in Britain, France and Ireland, that plans a stock market flotation to raise up to GBP 300 million.
The RES Group has offices across the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia.
UK Headquarters Building.
Since late 2003 RES has been based at its low carbon headquarters building at Beaufort Court, Kings Langley, Hertfordshire in the UK. This unique site, centred on the old 'Arts and Crafts' style Ovaltine Egg Farm building originally constructed in 1929, uses electricity supplied from its own 225 kW Vestas V29 wind turbine and from on-site photovoltaic panels. Heat comes from 170 m2 of solar thermal panels and from a biomass boiler. A miscanthus energy crop is grown on 5 hectares of the site, whilst cooling is produced on demand using pumped ground water.

99th Reconnaissance Squadron

The 99th Reconnaissance Squadron (99 RS) is a squadron of the United States Air Force. It is assigned to the 9th Operations Group, Air Combat Command, stationed at Beale Air Force Base, California. The squadron is equipped with the Lockheed U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft.
The 99 RS is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, first being organized as the 99th Aero Squadron on 21 August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to France and fought on the Western Front during World War I as a Corps observation squadron. 
During World War II the unit served both in the Panama Canal Zone as an anti-submarine unit and in the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) as part of Twentieth Air Force as a B-29 Superfortress bomber squadron. During the Cold War was part of Strategic Air Command equipped with B-47 Stratojet medium bombers, and later with the SR-71 Blackbird strategic reconnaissance aircraft.
Mission.
The 99th Reconnaissance Squadron is responsible for providing critical intelligence for use by the highest levels of our government. Squadron pilots fly the Lockheed U-2S aircraft as they continuously train to upgrade from normal aircraft commander status to that of instructor pilot status.
Pilots from the squadron frequently rotate overseas to support the wing's various operating locations. The squadron has one of the highest TDY rates in the Air Force, second only to that of the aircrews supporting the E-3 Sentry AWACS. This high operations tempo could not be effectively maintained without the crew chiefs assigned to the squadron who perform routine maintenance to keep the aircraft flying on a daily basis. 
In addition to the military reconnaissance mission, U-2 pilots fly many humanitarian, search and rescue and environmental missions.
The current mission statement of the 99th Reconnaissance Squadron is "To deploy and employ warrior Airmen and execute effective and sustained U-2 operations globally in support of National Objectives."
History.
World War I.
Organized at Kelly Field, Texas on 21 August 1917, the 99th Aero Squadron moved to Garden City, New York in early November and sailed for France on the fourteenth. After training in the Sopwith Camel and the Salmson 2, the squadron began flying combat missions in June 1918.
Assigned to the V Corps Observation Group, United States First Army Air Service, the 99th Aero Squadron (Corps Observation) was assigned to the Toul Sector of the French Western Front on 22 June. It served as a school squadron with V Army Corps Infantry Liaison School. On 19 July, was assigned to the St. Die sector during which time one flight of unit, operating in Vosges region of Alsace and Lorraine where it participated in combat with French XXXIII Corps.
Between September 12 and 16 the squadron flew reconnaissance missions and directed artillery fire in support French 8th Army and the American V Army Corps during the St. Mihiel offensive. It also participated in the Meuse-Argonne offensive between September 26 to November 11, 1918 when the Armistice with Germany was reached.
The 99th Aero Squadron remained in France until 8 May 1919, then moved to Mitchel Field, New York where the unit was demobilized; the men who had served in France were demobilized and returned to civilian life.
Inter-war period.
The 99th was retained after World War I as part of the permanent United States Army Air Service, and after a series of administrative moves in which the squadron was an administrative unit, was assigned to Bolling Field, District of Columbia where it was organized as 99th Corps Observation Squadron. It was manned largely with veterans of the AEF who remained in the Air Service and was equipped with war surplus Dayton-Wright DH-4s and some British Royal Aircraft Establishment SE-5s that had been shipped from Britain during the war as engineering models to license produce in the United States. 
At Bolling Field, the pilots of the squadron trained in aerial reconnaissance and also trained with Army units in Northern Virginia on battlefield observation maneuvers and artillery spotting and adjustments, similar to the combat missions the squadron flew on the Western Front during the way. However lack of funding for training and the general feeling in the United States that the peace lessened the need for a strong military led to many of the combat veterans to leave the service. As a result, the proficiency of squadron aircrews deteriorated until the 99th had no one proficient enough to participate in the 1929 bombing and gunnery matches.
In 1927, the 99th moved to Kelly Field, Texas where it was assigned to the Air Corps Training Center. It was inactivated on 31 July. On 9 November 1928, it was reactivated at Mitchell Field, New York and was eqipped with a series of observation aircraft, and performed operational testing on the planes, and various variants over the next several years. With the creation of the GHQ Air Force on 1 March 1935, the group became the 9th Bombardment Group and the 99th became a bombardment squadron. With the new mission came new airplanes. The new bombardment squadron received American-made Martin B-10s in 1936 and Douglas B-18s in 1938. Squadron members trained hard learning the tactics and maneuvers of their new aircraft and new mission.
World War II.
Antisubmarine warfare.
As part of the buildup of Air Corps forces in the Panama Canal Zone prior to the United States entry into World War II, the 99th was transferred to Rio Hato Field, Panama on 13 November 1940. It was almost immediately re-designated as the 99th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), and equipped with Douglas B-18 Bolos. Its mission was to patrol the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal. 
Tragedy struck the 99th early in its Panama assignment. On 27 February 1941, one of its B-18As, piloted by 1st Lieutenant Jack L. Schoch and with six other crew members aboard, crashed into Panama Bay just off Venado Beach, with the loss of all on board. The cause of this mysterious loss were never determined, although rescue efforts continued late into the night. With its remaining four B-18As, the unit continued its intensive training program from its base at Rio Hato until, on 25 August 1941, it received one of the new Boeing B-17B Flying Fortresses assigned to the Command. 
Just before the Pearl Harbor Attack, on 3 December, the Squadron was ordered to distant Zandrey Field, Dutch Guiana (by way of Piarco Field, Trinidad) under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, by which the United States occupied the colony to protect bauxite mines. However, to the disappointment of the crews, the squadron had to leave its B-17 behind. It was, however, reinforced with additional B-18As, bringing squadron strength up to six aircraft. At Zandry, the unit shuttled from Zandery to Atkinson Field, British Guiana and, by January 1942, had eight Curtiss P-40C Warhawks assigned. The P-40s were, in actuality detached for airfield defense by the Trinidad Base Command, under which the 99th fell at the time. 
The intensive flying of the first two months of the war soon took its toll, however, and by the end of February 1942, the Squadron was forced to report that it had but three B-18A's operational at Zandery and that " ... none of them are airworthy at this time." Apparently the unit was quickly reinforced and by 1 March strength was back up to six aircraft, and seven combat crews, all of whom had more than 12 months experience. 
Operations From Zandry Field consisted of coastal, convoy and anti-submarine patrols until 31 October 1942. Just prior to which time the 4th Antisubmarine Squadron was attached to the Squadron between 9 and 16 October. At this point Antisubmarine Command took over the mission of the 99th and the men and aircraft of the squadron were reassigned. The squadron was detached from Sixth Air Force and reassigned to Orlando AAF, Florida without personnel or equipment, where it became part of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) in central and northern Florida. 
At the AAFSAT, the squadron trained units at various airfields in central and Northern Florida, the squadron trained cadres for 44 bomb groups in organization and operations, performed bombing pattern tests, experimented with 3-plane formations to attack moving ships, and performed over a hundred equipment tests.
B-29 Superfortress era.
On 3 March 1944, the squadron was again moved without personnel or equipment to Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas where the 99th was assigned to the 313th Bombardment Wing, with a mission to organize and train for B-29 operations in the Western Pacific. The 99th helped to develop operational bombardment tactics and tested special devices and equipment during this time.
In 1944 the 99th moved to Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas where it began training on the new B-29 Superfortress as part of the 313th Bombardment Wing, to organize and train for B-29 operations in the Western Pacific. The 99th helped to develop operational bombardment tactics and tested special devices and equipment during this time. It then moved to McCook Army Airfield, Nebraska in May 1944 where it trained in earnest for its own combat deployment. 
After six months in the new B-29, the 99th transferred to North Field, Tinian, in the Mariana Islands, just east of the Philippines. Arriving at Tinian on 28 December 1944, the 99th Bombardment Squadron (Very Heavy) flew its first bombing raids on 27, 29 and 31 January 1945, against Japanese installations in the northern Marianas. On 25 February the 99th joined an all-out Allied effort against Tokyo's port and industrial areas.
For the remaining months of the war, squadron B-29s repeatedly struck Japanese aircraft factories, chemical plants, naval bases and airdromes. It also participated in night, low-level incendiary bombing attacks on urban areas. 
During these months the 99th won two Distinguished Unit Citations. The first came for 15–16 April 1945 bombing raids on Kawasaki, Japan's industrial center, which furnished components for Tokyo and Yokohama's heavy industry. The squadron won the second award in mine-laying operations beginning in mid May, 1944 in the Shimonoseki Straits, which controlled access to the Inland Seas. This operation crippled Japan's efforts to ship food, raw materials, war supplies, troops, and combat equipment to and from the homeland. 
The 99th Bomb Squadron continued its attacks on Japan until flying its last mission, a low-level night incendiary attack on Kumagaya on 14 August 1945. With the end of World War II, the squadron moved to Harmon Air Force Base, Guam on 17 March 1946 and inactivated there on 20 October 1948.
Strategic Air Command.
The Air Force established the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Fairfield-Suisun (later Travis) AFB, California on 25 April 1949 and activated it on 1 May as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) unit. 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron flew B/RB-17s and, later, B/RB-29s. RB-29s and a few RB-36s. Their mission was to conduct visual, photographic, electronic, and weather reconnaissance operations.
Squadron reconnaissance operations were short-lived,however, as on 1 April 1950, the Air Force re-designated the wing as the 9th Bombardment Wing and the 99th as a bombardment squadron. The 99th continued to fly B-29s at Fairfield-Suisun AFB until 1 May 1953, when SAC transferred the wing and its squadrons to Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. By June 1955, the 99th Bombardment Squadron had replaced its B-29s with new B-47 Stratojets. In November 1955 the 99th and other wing squadrons demonstrated the Strategic Air Command's ability to strike anywhere in the world making several deployments to England and Guam.
Squadron B-47s flew nonstop from the 8,300 miles from Mountain Home AFB to New Zealand. The 99th flew nuclear deterrent missions for ten years. In November 1965, SAC agreed to transfer Mountain Home AFB to the Tactical Air Command. The 99th's B-47s were retired and by 1 February 1966 all squadron aircraft were gone.
In January 1966 the first production SR-71 Blackbirds had landed at Beale AFB, California. This new aircraft gave SAC a reconnaissance capability that far exceeded any then available in terms of speed, altitude, and coverage. The SR-71 flew at more than three times the speed of sound (Mach 3+) at altitudes above 80,000 feet. It carried the most advanced observation equipment in the world. The provisional 4200th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (SRW) was activated at Beale AFB on 1 January 1965 as the SR-71’s parent unit. In October 1965 Fifteenth Air Force suggested the Air Force re-designate the 9th Bombardment Wing as the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing to continue the wing’s proud history. The Air Force agreed and on 25 June 1966 the wing became the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and the 99th a strategic reconnaissance squadron. The 9th SRW replaced the 4200th SRW at Beale AFB.
At Beale, the 99th trained with the SR-71 to bring the aircraft and crews to mission-ready status. By March 1967 the aircraft was ready. The SR-71 quickly deployed to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa and began flying operational missions over Southeast Asia. Squadron pilots and reconnaissance systems operator gathered photographic and electronic data for U.S. commanders in South Vietnam from 1967 until 1 April 1971 when the squadron inactivated.
In November 1972, the 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron was re-activated at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand. The squadron was equipped a combination of U-2s, DC-130’s and CH-3s flying classified missions over Southeast Asia until 30 June 1976. When the U-2 joined the SR-71 under the 9th
Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB, the 99th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron returned to Beale.
The U-2, although slower than the SR-71, cost much less to operate and provided more “on-station” time. As intelligence collection increased throughout the 1980s, 99th U-2 pilots manned detachments at sites around the world. With the SR-71’s retirement in 1990, the U-2 assumed responsibility for all of America’s manned high-altitude reconnaissance.
During Operation Desert Shield, 99th Squadron pilots immediately deployed to Saudi Arabia and flew their first missions of 19 August 1990, just 17 days after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Throughout Desert Shield/Storm, squadron pilots provided vital reconnaissance that kept coalition commanders informed on the positions and movement of Iraqi troops. This information made air attacks more effective and helped reduce casualties in the ground war.
Modern era.
Operational missions include extensive reconnaissance efforts during Operations Urgent Fury, Just Cause, Desert Shield, Desert Storm and operation Iraqi Freedom as well as humanitarian efforts covering wildfire and earthquake damage in California and Midwestern United States floods. 99 RS personnel are currently temporarily assigned to four overseas detachments.

The 99th Aero Squadron was a Air Service, United States Army unit that fought on the Western Front during World War I.
The squadron was assigned as a Corps Observation Squadron, performing short-range, tactical reconnaissance over the V Corps, United States First Army sector of the Western Front in France, providing battlefield intelligence. After the 1918 Armistice with Germany, the squadron returned to the United States in June 1919 and became part of the permanent United States Army Air Service in 1921, being re-designated as the 99 Squadron (Observation).
The current United States Air Force unit which holds its lineage and history is the 99th Reconnaissance Squadron, assigned to the 9th Operations Group, Beale Air Force Base, California.
History.
Origins.
The 99th Aero Squadron was organized on 21 August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. On 13 October 1917 the squadron was ordered to the Aviation Concentration Center, Mineola, Long Island, New York for overseas duty. 
The squadron proceeded by train from San Antonio to New York City, and arrived without incident. The 99th embarked for duty in France at Hoboken, New Jersey on the White Star liner RMS Cedric on 14 November. The liner crossed the Atlantic via Halifax, Nova Scotia without incident, and arrived in Liverpool, England, on 30 November. From Liverpool, the squadron took a train south to Winchester, where it remained until 7 December at a rest camp. On 8 December, the squadron crossed the English Channel, arriving in Le Harve, France. After two days awaiting transportation, the squadron boarded a troop train and arrived at American Expeditionary Forces 2d Aviation Instruction Center at Tours Aerodrome, France.
The 99th was the first complete American Aero Squadron to arrive at the 2d AIC. Men were assigned to special duty in various training departments. The instruction concentrated on becoming familiar to the British and French aircraft and various engines with which they were expedited to have experience with at the front. 
The squadron, now composed of three officers and 136 enlisted man left Tours on 9 March and arrived on 11 March at Haussimont Aerodrome, in the "Zone of Advance", or the Western Front. The squadron was designated as a Corps Observation squadron, and assigned to the Headquarters, Chief of Air Service, AEF. Hangars were erected at the field in preparation for reception of airplanes and pilots. On 23 March, 18 pilots were assigned to the squadron and an equal number of aircraft, British Sopwith 1½ Strutter, commonly called "Pups". At Haussimont, the squadron organization grew to include an armament, engineering, radio, photographic, and other departments. With the arrival of observers, the squadron was ready to enter combat as a completely equipped American Observation Squadron.
Combat in France.
The initial operations of the squadron began on 1 April with missions being flown in conjunction with the 3d Artillery Observation School at Mailly, France as part of the First Army Observation Group. This work continued daily until 31 May, when orders were received to move to Amanty Aerodrome. On 20 June, the first casualty of a flying officer occurred, while testing an aircraft at the French airdrome at Apiz, a 99th pilot was killed in a crash. 
The first flight across the lines into enemy territory occurred on 22 June 1918 when Lieutenants Alexander, Kahle, and Nutt, along with three observers flew over the enemy lines on a reconnaissance mission over the Toul-Moselle Sector. All of the aircraft returned with holes in the wings, attesting to the accuracy of enemy anti-aircraft artillery. 
Missions in the Toul Sector were of brief duration and on 1 July, the squadron was ordered to Luxeuil-les-Bains Aerodrome and transferred to the V Corps Observation Group. Being the first American Aero Squadron to arrive at Luxeuil, the squadron was given an unusually cordial reception. There, the squadron received the latest in French observation planes, the Salmson 2A2, as the Sopwiths were found to be unsatisfactory for reconnaissance over enemy territory.
Missions began immediately with the V Corps Infantry Aviation School at Luxeuil. A detachment of flying officers were dispatched to Corcieux Airdrome, Voages, France for flights over the lines with the French 285th Spad Squadron. The mission of the squadron at Corcieux was to cooperate with the French Air Force and enable the pilots and observers to learn the St. Die Sector. In order to learn the sector, the American Observers flew with French pilots, and French Observers flew with American pilots. In these flights, frequent combat was encountered with German aircraft.
On 24 July the 285th Squadron was ordered to move and the 99th’s 3d Flight, consisting of seven Salmsons, seven pilots, seven observers and their maintenance crews moved from Luxouil-les-Bains, to the French Dogneville Airdrome. There, the flight was assigned to the 33rd French Corps, was ordered to carry on the work over the sector formerly covered by the 285th Squadron. The 99th flew reconnaissance missions and directed artillery fire in support of U.S. Army, 5th Division’s offensive against German soldiers entrenched at Frapelle.
From Dogneville, the 3rd Flight flew photographic missions more than 40 kilometers behind enemy lines. No other unit, in this sector, had ever photographed deeper than ten kilometers before. When the 5th Division began its attack on 17 August 1918, the 3rd kept two aircraft airborne throughout the day. One observed enemy positions and directed artillery fire. The other maintained contact with Allied infantry and advised headquarters of the line-of-advance. Since the ground troops never displayed panels to show their position, pilots often had to fly low enough to distinguish between friendly and enemy uniforms. This exposed the aircraft and crew to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire. Contact crews often aided the ground offensive by attacking machine-gun sites and firing at enemy troops. After the successful offensive, 3d Flight crews photographed the new front lines
Observers developed an effective means of communicating their information to the ground commanders. They first radioed the data to their ground station. Pilots then flew over the unit command post and observers dropped a written message confirming the radio call. They next flew over corps headquarters and dropped another note verifying their radio communication. Despite what seemed to be an efficient method, aviators and artillery troops often had difficulty communicating and seldom made an effective team.
The 99th also aided the 5th Corps during the St. Mihiel offensive from 12 through 16 September. The squadron had moved to Souilly Aerodrome on 7 September. German soldiers were well entrenched and prepared for a prolonged defense of their positions. Before the attack, crews flew photographic reconnaissance missions taking oblique shots of enemy positions. As the ground offensive began on 12 September, a heavy mist, low-hanging clouds and intermittent rain severely hampered aerial observation. Nevertheless, 99th pilots flew visual observation and artillery adjustment missions throughout the day.
Severe weather also affected aerial operations on 13 September, but skies cleared the following day. So the 99th flew infantry contact, artillery adjustment, photographic and visual reconnaissance missions. Flying eight kilometers deep behind enemy lines, crews produced photographs that clearly defined enemy positions. Some of Germany’s best aviators operated in this area, but Allied crews successfully defended themselves and completed their mission. On 15 September, foul weather returned and limited flights to visual operations and artillery adjustments.
On 20 September the 99th Aero Squadron moved to Foucaucourt Aerodrome and prepared to help the 5th Corps in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Again, the German soldiers opposed the attack from barbed-wire-protected trenches. Also, additional enemy pursuit, observation and bombardment forces meant most of the Kaiser’s best aviation units defended the area.
When the ground attack began on 26 September, inclement weather restricted flight operations. Rain, haze and fog usually obscured the ground from then until 11 November. Since cloud cover severely limited photographic reconnaissance, headquarters confined missions to a few, well-defined and extremely important areas. Aircraft and pilots often stood ready to fly, waiting in vain for any break in the clouds. When weather permitted, crews took oblique photographs along enemy lines. If the need for information was great, pilots flew even in heavy cloud cover hoping for a chance break to take that important picture.
Pursuit planes protected observation aircraft during these missions. The large number of enemy pursuit aircraft operating in the area made an attack during photographic flights almost a certainty. The pursuit protectors often flew about 500 meters above the observation aircraft. This gave them an advantage against enemy attackers. Photographic aircraft also flew during large bombing and pursuit operations to take advantage of the amassed firepower. The four black crosses on the 9th Reconnaissance Wing’s emblem today represent 1st and 99th Squadrons’ participation at St. Mihiel, Argonne-Meuse, Champagne-Marne and Aisne-Marne.
Demobilization.
With the Armistice with Germany reached on 11 November 1918, combat operations ended. After nearly three months of service on the front, the 99th Aero Squadron lost 3 members Killed in Action, and another 5 members killed from wounds or other causes. Six other members were wounded. One aircraft, a Salmson, did not return from a mission on 29 September, its pilot and observer were not accounted for and were carried as Missing In Action. Both members were later determined to be KIA and their bodies were recovered. 
With the end of combat, the 99th was transferred to Air Service Headquarters, AEF, at Chaumont. With the sudden end of the war, the process of returning the AEF to the United States took several months. Squadron pilots began flying courier and liaison flights within the American sector, while flights of the squadron were dispatched to several airfields to support the French Air Force in reconstruction and other necessary tasks.
On 19 February 1919 orders were received for the squadron to report to the 1st Air Depot, Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome to turn in all of its supplies and equipment and was relieved from duty with the AEF. The squadron's planes were delivered to the Air Service Production Center No. 2. at Romorantin Aerodrome, and there, practically all of the pilots and observers were detached from the Squadron.
Personnel were subsequently assigned to the Commanding General, Services of Supply and ordered to report to a staging camp at Sadirac. There, personnel awaited scheduling to report to one of the Base Ports in France for transport to the United States and subsequent demobilization. In early May, the 99th was moved to the Base Port at Bordeaux, and the squadron arrived in New York about the 23d and began the process of demobilization at Hazelhurst Field on Long Island. By the middle of June, the 99th Aero Squadron was fully demobilized, its men returned to civilian life.

List of Big Brother 10 (U.S.) HouseGuests

Thirteen HouseGuests in total entered the House on the tenth edition of American reality television series "Big Brother"; the HouseGuests were observed by television viewers 24 hours a day. Each week, one or more HouseGuests were evicted by votes of the remaining HouseGuests until the winner was left standing.
The HouseGuests are complete strangers for the first time since "Big Brother 3". Unlike previous seasons which featured 14 to 16 HouseGuests, the tenth edition will only feature thirteen HouseGuests. This is the first time there has been a decrease in the number of HouseGuests over a previous season and the first time since "Big Brother 4" that only 13 HouseGuests will enter the House.
Angie.
Angie Swindell
April.
April Dowling-Cruise (born March 24, 1978), 35, from Higley, Arizona, was working as a financial manager at a car dealership. She has taken part in the Lingerie Football League, as part of the Phoenix Scorch team. She graduated from Doane College in Crete, NE with a Bachelor's Degree in Sports and Fitness Management. She is a practicing Roman Catholic and is of Irish descent. While in the house, April had a romantic relationship with Ollie, with the two also working together. She also had rocky relationships with Keesha and Libra, who she formed an alliance with the first week. Numerous people in the house disliked April, mainly Keesha, Renny, and Memphis. During the first week, April, Libra, Keesha and Ollie managed to turn the other HouseGuests against Brian, ultimately leading to his eviction. April won the fourth Head of Household competition of the season, and nominated Jessie and Memphis for eviction. Despite April's heavy campaigning for Memphis to leave, her allies turned against her and Jessie was evicted. When Renny won the sixth Head of Household competition, she chose to nominate April and Jerry for eviction. Despite April trying to bribe him to use the Veto on her with $5,000 she had earned in a previous Veto competition, Dan chose to leave nominations the same. April was evicted on Day 45 in a four to one vote. She came in 8th place, and voted for Dan to win. On the show, she had sex with another houseguest, Ollie.
Since her appearance on the show, April is now married to Ryan Cruise and has a son Easton Mitchell Cruise, born June 14, 2010. She also has a second son, who was born in August 2012. 
Brian.
Brian Hart (born August 21, 1980), 33, worked in the telecommunications industry but was also involved in several entrepreneurial ventures. He's from San Francisco, California. He served in the U.S. Air Force for six years as an F-16 crew chief and was honorably discharged and received an associate degree from the Community College of the Air Force. Brian became close with Angie, Dan and Steven in the house, and formed an alliance with Dan and Ollie during the first few days. On Day 7, Brian was put on the block after Jessie used the Power of Veto and took himself off the block. He became the first HouseGuest evicted from the house on Day 9 with a nine to one vote. Brian returned to the season briefly in the fifth week, as the host of the "In the News" food competition.
The following year for "Big Brother 11", Brian was a candidate to return should his clique, the "Brains", win the first Head of Household competition. The group failed, and Brian did not return to the house.
Dan.
Dan Gheesling (born September 1, 1983), 30, is from Dearborn, MI. Gheesling teached biology, physical education, and health at Orchard Lake St. Mary's Preparatory School and was the assistant coach of the school's football team. Gheesling had close friendships with Brian, Libra, Memphis, Keesha, Steven, Angie and Renny. Gheesling and his closest friend in the house, Memphis, formed an alliance and named it "The Renegades". Gheesling was nominated along with his friend Steven by HOH Jessie in Week 2 and survived the eviction. He was voted by viewers for America's Player (for Week Four only). He accepted the offer. Dan's tasks were to get Jessie nominated, hug Jessie for ten seconds, and vote for Jessie in the eviction ceremony. Gheesling succeeded in all three and earned $30,000. Dan had also been the victim of constant attacks from Jerry, with Jerry repeatedly referring to Dan as a 'Judas' and accusing him of "hiding behind his cross." Jerry even stated at the veto meeting that he wanted Dan on the block because he believed he is a "Judas," to which Dan simply replied, ""I understand."" Jerry didn't use the veto that week. In Week 6, Dan won the PoV but chose not to use it. Dan also won HoH for Week 7. After turning on a deal made with Ollie, Dan nominated Michelle as a replacement when Memphis saved himself. This was followed by Ollie thrashing items in the house and directing homophobic slurs towards both Dan and Memphis. Dan also won the POV during the live double eviction episode, choosing not to use it. When Jerry subsequently became HoH, Dan was nominated alongside Keesha. In Week 9, Dan won Head of Household, making him the 3rd person to win HoH twice. He also won the Luxury competition in the same week and could take another HouseGuest or a Jury member with him; Dan chose to take Michelle, hoping to bond with her and secure her vote. Afterward, Dan won the final Head of Household, becoming the first person in season 10 to win the position three times. He chose to take his alliance member and closest friend Memphis to the finale. At the finale, Dan won Big Brother 10. He's the first and only person in Big Brother history to win by a 7-0 unanimous vote. Dan returned to play the game a second time for "Big Brother 14" as a coach or "mentor," playing for his own separate prize ($100,000) along with three other returning houseguests. After the first four houseguests left the game in season 14, the coaches were offered the chance by America to re-enter the game as main players and houseguests. Dan was one of three coaches, along with Britney and Janelle, who accepted the offer to become a player in Big Brother 14. Mike "Boogie" Malin chose not to become a player, but was compelled to do so when production dictated that if any one of the coaches chose to enter the game as a player, every one of them must. Thus, the coaches joined in the competition with the new house guests for the main $500,000 prize. He outlasted the entire house once again, becoming the first person to be in the final two twice, the first winner from a previous season to be in the final two, as well as the first person to play twice and receive no eviction votes against them in both seasons. He also holds the record to play the game twice and only exit on finale night. However, he ultimately lost in a 6-1 vote to Ian Terry, becoming the runner-up of Big Brother 14. 
Jerry.
Jerry MacDonald (born March 13, 1933), 80, worked for 38 years in a sales/marketing environment and retired as a general manager. He spent four years in the United States Marine Corps and was honorably discharged in 1954. He's been married for 54 years and takes care of his wife who was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. He lives in Magnolia, Texas. At 75 years old, he is the oldest male HouseGuest in "Big Brother" history and the oldest HouseGuest in American "Big Brother" history. Jerry was voted Head of Household for Week 1. He nominated Jessie and Renny but when Jessie was taken off the block he put Brian up. He was involved in a conflict with Memphis, caused in part by Jerry calling him a womanizer. Jerry has also attacked Dan, notably referring to him as a "Judas", and in fact telling him that at a veto meeting. He has also accused Dan of "hiding behind his cross". He also said for Dan to "burn in hell." Jerry also got into a verbal fight with Libra in week 2 and accused her of calling him slow and old. He won the PoV two weeks in a row, Week 4 and Week 5 and both times he chose not to use it. In Week 6 he was nominated with April by Renny. In Week 7 he was nominated with Memphis by Dan. In that same week he won a phone call from home, and again was nominated with Ollie by Keesha. Then in week 8 he won HoH, being the second person this season to win HoH twice. He was evicted by Dan on day 66, becoming the seventh and final jury member. On Day 71, it was announced that Jerry had come second in the poll to find America's Favourite Juror behind Keesha. Dan and Jerry later become friends and continue to keep in contact. Jerry was referenced in "Big Brother 14" during the August 30, 2012 live show during Britney's eviction speech.
Jessie.
Jessie Godderz (born April 23, 1986), 27, is a professional bodybuilder with the World Natural Body Building Federation from Huntington Beach, California. He graduated from high school in Iowa. His goal is to be an inspirational figure to people who want to lose weight, get fit or pursue a drug-free, bodybuilding life style. When he was 19, he worked as a Train Conductor for the Union Pacific Railroad. In Week 1, Jerry nominated he and Renny; then he won the Veto and took himself off the block. He was the HoH for Week 2 and nominated Steven and Dan. He was nominated with Angie by Keesha in Week 3 and survived the eviction. He was nominated yet again with Memphis by April, and was evicted by a 4-3 vote. Jessie also made appearances on the MTV dating shows "Next" and "Exposed"; both appearances were not successful. On Day 60, he made an appearance in the house as part of a luxury competition, dressed as a gorilla. Jessie was given the opportunity to join the Big Brother 11 houseguests at the first head of household competition. His clique, the athletes, won the competition, so Jessie became the 13th houseguest of Big Brother 11. He was then evicted on Day 40 by a vote of 3-2 and became first member of the jury. Jessie returned briefly during Big Brother 12 after HOH Britney opened Pandora's Box offering free advice from a past houseguest. The twist was that the free advice was not gameplay advice but fitness advice and the past houseguest was revealed to be Jessie. The two then spent an hour locked inside Pandora's box with Jessie giving fitness advice while the other houseguests were given a luau party in the backyard. He would then return the next season on Big Brother 13 again with a Pandora's Box offering a shopping spree with Tori Spelling. However, Rachel, the HOH of the week, was locked inside Pandora's Box with Jessie for a shopping spree of "Mr. Pec-tacular" merchandise, while the rest of the house earned the shopping spree with Tori Spelling. In 2011, Godderz signed a contract with professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Jessie returned once again in Big Brother 14. This time, after houseguest Ian opened Pandora's Box, Jessie came and took all the houseguests' junk food away.
Keesha.
Keesha Marie Smith (born August 1, 1978), 34, is a waitress at Hooters from Burbank, California. Keesha is a member of PETA and doesn't eat red meat. Early in the game, Keesha found herself aligned with Libra and April, despite both her and April verbally expressing their dislike of each other. Keesha also had an odd relationship with Libra because Keesha constantly talked bad about Libra behind her back and even made up lies about Libra to Renny and Jerry so they would verbally attack her. On several occasions, Keesha wanted Libra to be evicted and even when Keesha won HOH she almost nominated Libra. The two women had a huge argument on Day 8. Keesha won her first HoH competition in Week 3 following the departure of Steven, with whom she had grown very close. She nominated those who she felt responsible for his eviction - Angie and Jessie. Keesha then won the Power of Veto but did not use it. In Week 4, Keesha aligned herself with Dan, Memphis and Renny, as well as her previous ally Libra, and was pivotal in the move to evict Jessie instead of Memphis. However, this resulted in her being nominated along with Libra by Michelle in Week 5, though Libra was evicted in a 6-0 vote. Keesha won her second HoH in Week 7 nominating Jerry and Ollie, making her the first houseguest of season 10 to hold the role twice. The next week, Keesha was nominated by Jerry, but was saved 2-0 against her best friend in the house Renny. The following week, Memphis won the PoV making Keesha the only remaining potential nominee. Despite the pair being close throughout the game, Memphis chose to evict Keesha over Jerry on Day 64 claiming that it would be easier for him to get to the finals with Jerry in the final 3. Keesha became the 6th member of the jury of seven. Keesha has a brother-sister relationship with Dan. On Finale Night, it was revealed that the public had voted for Keesha to win $25,000 having received the most votes in a poll to find America's Favourite Juror. Keesha voted for her close friend Dan to win Big Brother 10 over Memphis.
Libra.
Libra Thompson (born August 6, 1976), 36, is a human resources representative from Spring, Texas. She describes herself as an "Obama supporter living in Bush country." She attended Rice University and has a bachelor's degree in political science and economics. Thompson, An African American has been in an interracial marriage for seven years and has three children: a 4-year old girl and 4-month old twins; one twin is dark-skinned and the other is light-skinned, a medical rarity. In the house, Libra became known for her strong strategic play which saw her pivotal in the evictions of the first four houseguests. This gameplay however came back to haunt her when she was nominated with Keesha by Michelle in Week 5, and was then evicted by a 6-0 vote on day 38. Libra became the first member of the jury, and voted for Dan to win Big Brother 10.
Memphis.
Robert "Memphis" Garrett (born December 6, 1982), 30, is a bartender (or, as he preferred, "mixologist") from Los Angeles, California. He is originally from Tennessee, hence the nickname "Memphis". Memphis attended Florida State University and earned an associate's degree in event management. In the first food competition Memphis won a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro as a bonus. Memphis has particularly close relationships with Dan and Keesha. Memphis and Dan formed an alliance and named it "The Renegades". Memphis was nominated Week 4 and narrowly escaped the eviction, by Keesha getting half the house to turn on Jessie. Memphis was once again nominated on Week 7 along with Jerry by his fellow ally, Dan. In Week 7 Memphis won The Power Of Veto and used it to take himself off the block. He won POV on week 8 and chose to take off Dan. He's the second person this season to win POV on back to back weeks. He also won POV on week 9, having the only vote, he chose to evict his good friend in the house, Keesha. At the finale, in a 7-0 vote Memphis became the Runner-Up of Big Brother 10 and won the $50,000. After leaving the house, Memphis was told that Big Brother couldn't give him the car because they didn't own it and someone else held the title so the car was returned almost immediately to the owner so Memphis received an undisclosed amount of money instead.
Michelle.
Michelle Costa (born December 29, 1979), 33, is a realtor from Cumberland, Rhode Island. She is of Portuguese descent. She graduated from Cumberland High School and studied real estate with RE/MAX. Michelle had a close friendship and alliance with fellow houseguest, Jessie. She held the PoV in Week 2 and didn't use it. She won the HoH competition for Week 5 and nominated Keesha and Libra in revenge for them rallying to get rid of Jessie. However, Michelle told Keesha that Libra was her main target because Michelle had a strong dislike for Libra and wanted to get rid of her more than Keesha. Keesha agreed with Michelle and said that she did not like Libra either. In week 7 she replaced Memphis on the block after he used the Power of Veto on himself. On Day 52, Michelle was evicted by a 3-1 vote and became the third member of the jury. In Week 9, Michelle was given the opportunity to go on a private beach vacation for a day with Dan, who had won the trip and chose to take her. Michelle voted for Dan to win in the finale.

Pathfinder Roleplaying Game

The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a fantasy role-playing game (RPG) that was first published in 2009 by Paizo Publishing. It extends and modifies the Revised 3rd edition "Dungeons & Dragons" ("D&D") game rules published by Wizards of the Coast under the Open Game License. "Pathfinder RPG" is intended to be backward-compatible with "D&D" version 3.5, while addressing some of its issues.
The "Pathfinder RPG" supports "Pathfinder" adventure paths as well as other works set in the "Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting".
Background.
The Paizo Publishing company had been publishing "Dungeon" and "Dragon" magazines, which were about the "Dungeons & Dragons" (D&D) role-playing game. Paizo was publishing under contract with Wizards of the Coast, who held the rights to D&D. Wizards of the Coast chose not to renew the contract in early 2007, and Paizo began publishing the "Pathfinder" periodical line as a replacement. In August 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the pending release of the 4th edition of "Dungeons & Dragons", which replaced version 3.5. Many of the staff at Paizo were concerned about the more restrictive Game System License the 4th edition was being released under. Instead of continuing to support "D&D", Paizo released "Pathfinder" as a modified version of the 3.5 edition game, under the Open Game License used by the older version. Announced in March 2008, the "Pathfinder RPG" was designed over the course of a year using an open playtest model, where players could try the system and post their feedback on Paizo's website.
Reception.
Paizo’s decision to create "Pathfinder RPG" at the same time as the release of "Dungeons & Dragons" 4th edition split the gaming community, with some showing more loyalty to the 3.5 compatible system and others showing more loyalty to the "Dungeons & Dragons" brand. Jeff LaSala writing for geekosystem.com says that the system has drawn away half of the gaming base from "Dungeons & Dragons".
Paizo has won ENnie Awards at Gen Con in a variety of categories including Best Publisher and Best Game. The beta release of the game won the 2008 gold ENnie award for "best free product or web enhancement."
"Pathfinder" has frequently been a best-selling role-playing game.
Design.
The "Pathfinder" is a modification of version 3.5 of "Dungeons & Dragons", and is intended to be 100% compatible with the older game. Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn felt that the basic classes of D&D version 3.5 were lackluster, as they did not provide incentive to stay with a single class for 20 levels of play. "Pathfinder" adds many options to the classes and boosts their abilities in their core roles.
The game has also been modified compared to "D&D" version 3.5 to clean up and streamline problematic areas. Changes were made to improve balance between different game elements. For example, less combat-oriented classes receive more hit points each level. Additionally, several aspects of 3.5 have been simplified in "Pathfinder", including several spells, the skill system, and combat maneuvers such as tripping and grappling.
Books and magazines.
The "Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook" is 576-page hardback book under the Open Game License.
The "Bestiary", "Bestiary 2", "Bestiary 3", and "Bestiary 4" contain statistics and descriptions of creatures that player characters may encounter. The "Pathfinder Bestiary" includes over 350 monsters designed for use with the game. 
Paizo also publishes the "Pathfinder" periodical product lines. The "Pathfinder Modules" line has been entirely compatible with the "Pathfinder RPG" since July 2009.
In addition, there have been numerous other expansions and accessory books which contain expanded rules, new classes, spells, equipment and other optional game features.

Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp

Berlin-Marzahn Rastplatz was a camp set up for Romani people in the Berlin suburb of Marzahn by Nazi authorities.
At 4 a.m. on 16 July 1936, prior to the opening of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, police began arresting all Romani people in Greater Berlin and forcibly relocated them to Marzahn, an open field in eastern Berlin sandwiched between a cemetery and a sewage dump.
Later, the prison would be surrounded by barbed wire and prisoners were subject to forced labour in armament plants.
Eventually, the men from Marzahn would be sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp (in 1938), and women and children were sent to Auschwitz (in 1943).

Jeff Hensley (born November 11, 1962, in Ridgeway, Virginia), is a former NASCAR driver. Currently, he is the crew chief for Miguel Paludo, who drives No. 32 truck for Turner Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series. He most recently served as the Director of Competition for Bobby Hamilton Racing-Virginia.
Hensley began racing at the age of eighteen, racing in various short tracks in Virginia and North Carolina. In 1982, he moved to the newly formed Busch Grand National Series, competing in the #63 for his family-owned team. In his first season of competition, he ran ten races, and had five top-ten finishes. His abbreviated schedule landed him twentieth in points. The following season, he ran twenty-eight of the schedule thirty-five races, and had nine top-ten finishes, and improved to tenth in standings.
He had two less top-tens in 1984, but had a career-best eighth-place finish in points. After he dropped to three top-tens in 1985, in the #2 Flute's Sheetmetal car, he retired and became the crew chief for his family's #63 car. He worked with Jimmy Hensley, Larry Pollard, and Mike Swaim over the next three years before Chuck Bown became the new driver of the 63 in 1989. They won the championship together in 1990, earning Hensley Mechanic of the Year honors. They continued to work together until the 1994 season, when Bown left and was replaced by his brother Jim. Hensley continued working for the team until it was sold in 2001.
Following the sale, he worked for Arrington Manufacturers for three years before returning to the track when he was hired by Bill Davis Racing in 2004 to serve as the crew chief for Bill Lester's #22 truck. The following season, he was reassigned to the #5 of Mike Skinner, where he stayed for two and a half seasons. He and Skinner won eight races and finished second in points during the 2007 season. In June 2008, he left BDR for personal reasons, before he was hired at Hamilton Racing.
Hensley then moved to Red Horse Racing for 2009 and 2010 to work with Timothy Peters. The duo won in both years with victories at Martinsville and Daytona. Hensley left RHR after 2010 to work for Kevin Harvick Incorporated. Though he initially served as Ron Hornaday's crew chief, he moved to crew chief for Nelson Piquet, Jr. and the #8 truck

List of Space Invaders video games

Space Invaders is a Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. It was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who was inspired by other media: "Breakout", "The War of the Worlds", and "Star Wars". Though simplistic by contemporary standards, it was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry. It was first released as an arcade game and later remade on different platforms; re-releases include ported and updated versions. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional gameplay options, including moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player modes.
Taito released numerous sequels and spin-offs, many of which have also been remade on multiple platforms, including home consoles and handheld devices. Follow up titles are typically released in celebration of the original's anniversary. The first sequels were primarily released in arcades, while later titles were released on portable devices. Sequels often added power-ups and incorporated new gameplay mechanics—like three-dimensional playing fields, bosses, and rhythm-action—to the original's design. Most titles were released internationally, though some are exclusive to select regions. The games have received different receptions: the Atari 2600 port of the original became the video game industry's first "killer app", while some sequels were regarded as insignificant updates. "Space Invaders" and several of its arcade sequels are often included in video game compilations released by Taito. It inspired numerous other games; many companies created clones that copied its gameplay (such as "Super Invader" and "TI Invaders"), while others built upon the original's gameplay (such as "Galaxian" and "Galaga").

Honda CD250U

The Honda CD250 is a two-cylinder motorcycle which was retailed by Honda in the UK from 1988 to 1993. It has a single front disc brake and a rear drum. It has two into two exhausts. High level of reliability and very reasonable torque and handling, has electric starting and CDI ignition.
The engine is an air-cooled 233 cc four-stroke 180-degree parallel twin, with the cylinders inclined forwards at 15 degrees from vertical and a chain-driven single overhead cam. The fuel tank holds 10 litres of petrol (with a 1.8 litre reserve capacity). With an oil capacity of 1.6 litres using 10W40 SE spec oil. A diamond frame is used, with telescopic front forks and a rear swingarm.
Very similar to the Honda Benly range of cycles, except the Benly models had a 360-degree crankshaft, which meant they could use a single coil and a single carburetor. The CDU has twin CV carbs. No tachometer in the instrumentation, only a speedometer and supplementary lighting for Neutral, Indicators and High Beam. Gear change ratios are placed around the speedometer to indicate gear change speed ranges. A dualseat provides good passenger compatibility and comfort.
The CD250U has a top speed between 70 and 80 mph, depending on wind conditions and gradient, and passenger / luggage.
Very economical, 80 mpg; though some claim they are able to get up to 90 mpg (imp).
Rickman made a full fairing option, and the model was used by police units in the early 1990s.
The engine was also used in the later CM250 Rebel and CB "Two Fifty" models (also known and marketed as the "Night Hawk" in the U.S.)

The hotel opened in 1907. Named for the Gadsden Purchase, the stately five-story, 160-room hotel became a home away from home for cattlemen, ranchers, miners, and businessmen. The hotel was leveled by fire and rebuilt in 1929. The Gadsden's spacious main lobby is majestically set with a solid white Italian marble staircase and four soaring marble columns. An authentic Tiffany & Co. stained glass mural extends forty-two feet across one wall of the massive mezzanine. An impressive oil painting by Audley Jean Nichols is just below the Tiffany window. According to the hotel's website, vaulted stained glass skylights run the full length of the lobby.
The Hotel is said to be haunted and has been in "ghost" shows on TV, such as "Sightings" in 1995.
The Gadsden Hotel has also been in several movies such as "The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean" with Paul Newman, "Terminal Velocity" with Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski, "Ruby Jean and Joe" with Tom Selleck and many others. The Gadsden was featured on "Hotel Impossible" on August 26, 2013.

Every Second Counts (book)

Every Second Counts is a 2003 autobiographical book by cyclist Lance Armstrong written in collaboration with sports writer and columnist Sally Jenkins. It is a follow-up to Armstrong's which was also written with Sally Jenkins. The narrative begins from after Armstrong's first Tour de France win in 1999 and continues up until his fifth win in 2003.
In Paris on 25 July 1999, Lance Armstrong made world headlines with a stunning comeback, winning the Tour de France after battling against life-threatening testicular cancer just eighteen months previously. A few months after that historic victory, he became a father for the first time. His first book, It's Not About the Bike, charted his journey back to life and went on to become an international bestseller, and to win the William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2000.
Now, in this follow-up, Armstrong shares more details of his life story, including four more Tour de France wins, an Olympic medal, and the births of his twin daughters Grace and Isabelle. Never shy of controversy, Lance Armstrong is a genuine global sports superstar and one of cycling's most recognizable figure. Here he offers his life philosophy - his thoughts on training, competing, winning, doping and failure. He also recounts the work done for the Foundation he set up following his dramatic recovery and introduces further inspirational tales of cancer survival.
Every Second Counts is another book from a man who strives every day to meet life's momentous challenges. However, the authenticity of the tale of Armstrong's anti-doping stance described in the work has been challenged by a report from USADA in 2012.

Career.
Hunter's career began with a band called "Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays," who released their first album in 1986 entitled "Cry Wilf". Later he released three more with his own band. He spent much of the 1990s playing small clubs in London, such as the Weavers Pub in Islington (North London), and the 100 Club on Oxford Street in London. Hunter's soulful style drew the attention of Van Morrison, who appeared on Hunter's first album released on Ace, "Believe What I Say", in 1996. (Morrison sang backing vocals on "Turn On Your Love Light" and "Ain't Nothing You Can Do".)
Hunter's relationship with Morrison led to a tour with the latter in the early nineties; he sang backing vocals on Morrison's 1994 live album, "A Night in San Francisco", and his 1995 studio recording "Days Like This". Hunter's first solo release in the United States, his 2006 breakthrough album "People Gonna Talk", was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album at the 49th Grammy Awards ceremony.

E.B. Morgan House

The E.B. Morgan House at 431 Main St, Aurora, New York was designed in the Italianate style by New York architect Joseph C. Wells for Edwin Barber Morgan, a wealthy entrepreneur and US Congressman. Built between 1857 and 1858, the mansion expressed the new wealth of businessmen in Central New York. Their innovative companies had operations extending to California and the South. The mansion is a contributing property within the Aurora Village–Wells College Historic District, listed in 1980 on the National Register of Historic Places.
History of E.B. Morgan and his house.
Morgan had the house constructed beginning in 1857 at a cost of $50,000 (a staggering sum for the 19th century.) He commissioned it from New York City architect Joseph C. Wells for his wife, Charlotte Wood Morgan, and their children. (Wells also designed the Presbyterian Church in Aurora.)
Morgan was born in Aurora in 1806, and maintained a home there his entire life. From a young age, Morgan showed considerable business savvy. As a child he worked alongside his father at the family store. Once an adult, E.B. Morgan made money as an entrepreneur in the trade industry on Cayuga Lake. With the capital he earned, he built the Aurora Inn in 1833. It served people involved with the busy shipping on the lake.
Morgan became lifelong friends and business partner with Henry Wells. E.B. Morgan became an early investor in several of Wells' business ventures, including his American Express Company and the Wells Fargo Company. Morgan was also an investor in many local enterprises, and a founding investor in the "New York Times".
The prominent Ithaca resident Ezra Cornell was another of E.B. Morgan's business partners. In the 1870s they invested in the Cayuga Lake Railroad Company. The train ran along Cayuga Lake behind both the Inn and E.B. Morgan's private home. Morgan was thrilled with the train and saw its location as allowing him to monitor his investment. He was said to stand with a watch in hand to check the train's punctuality as it passed through his yard.
Following Morgan's death, his daughter and her husband Nicholas Zabriskie took over the E.B. Morgan House. The mansion continued as a Morgan-Zabriskie family home until it was donated to Wells College in 1961. Wells College used the home as dormitories for students' studying French; only French was allowed to be spoken there. While being used as a French-immersion dormitory, the E.B. Morgan House was called "French House", a name which many locals continue to use today.
Architecture.
In 2005 the Aurora Foundation and the Pleasant Rowland Foundation completed a multi-million dollar renovation of the house. The E.B. Morgan renovation team included Pleasant Rowland, Katie Waller (Director of Aurora Foundation) and Steve McGlynn (Project Manager), Holmes King Kallquist Architects of Syracuse, McGlynn Interiors of Skaneateles, and Northeast Construction Services of Syracuse. It is operated as an inn, with options to rent single rooms or the entire mansion for special events. The Foundation focused on maintaining the architectural history of the house, while enhancing it as a lakefront retreat.
Architectural details were preserved while contemporary heating and cooling systems were installed. In addition, it was upgraded with contemporary plumbing. Gas fireplaces were installed in four of the guest rooms. 
Now operated as a bed and breakfast, the house features seven guest rooms, living areas, and a shaded porch that overlooks Cayuga Lake. The house features views of either Cayuga Lake or the village. It is fitted with modern technology. 
The Morgan House is available for individual room rental, or the whole house can be rented. The house can accommodate up to 14 for a seated dinner (served on regional specialty Mackenzie-Childs china) or 48 for a cocktail reception.

1975–76 Chicago Black Hawks season

The 1975–76 Chicago Black Hawks season was the Hawks' fiftieth season in the NHL. During the previous season, the club had a 37-35-8 record, earning 82 points, and finished in third place in the Smythe Division. Then, the Black Hawks upset the heavily favored Boston Bruins in the NHL preliminary series before losing to the Buffalo Sabres in the NHL quarter-finals.
Chicago started off the 1975–76 regular season with a 10-4-11 record in their first 25 games and took the lead in the Smythe Division. The Hawks had a 15 game unbeaten streak (6-0-9) during that span. The team reached a peak of being ten games over .500 with a record of 21-11-16 through 48 games. Chicago then fell into a slump and found themselves under .500 with only four games left in the season, falling to 29-30-17. The club went unbeaten in their last four games (3-0-1) to finish the year with a 32-30-18 record, earning 82 points, which was enough to finish in first place in the Smythe Division. The Hawks 32 wins was their lowest toal since 1967-68, when they also won 32 games.
Offensively, the Black Hawks were led by Pit Martin, who had a club high 32 goals and 71 points. Dennis Hull rebounded from a poor 1974-75 season to score 27 goals and 66 points. Ivan Boldirev scored 28 goals and 62 points. Defenseman Dale Tallon led the club with 47 assists, while scoring 15 goals for 62 points. Stan Mikita missed 32 games due to injuries; however, he still earned 57 points. Keith Magnuson had a team high +13 rating, and Phil Russell led the club with 194 penalty minutes.
In goal, Tony Esposito once again led the club with 30 victories and a 2.97 GAA, earning four shutouts in 68 games.
Since the Hawks won their division, they were given a bye in the NHL preliminary series, and they faced the powerful Montreal Canadiens in the NHL quarter-finals. The Canadiens had a record breaking season in 1975-76 with 58 wins and 127 points and finished in first place in the Norris Division. The Black Hawks—Candiens series opened with two games at the Montreal Forum. The Canadiens quickly took control of the series, shutting out Chicago 4-0 in the series opener, and then winning 3-1 in the second game. The series continued at Chicago Stadium for the next two games, where the Canadiens took the third game by a 2-1 score, and then swept the Hawks out of the playoffs with a 4-1 victory in the fourth game.

Midnight Ramblers

The Midnight Ramblers (Ramblers) is an award-winning, all-male, contemporary, a cappella group based at the University of Rochester. Since their creation they have been entirely student organized and directed. They are also made up exclusively of members of Rochester's undergraduate community. In April 2008, they celebrated their tenth anniversary, with nearly every alumnus of the group in attendance. Following the show, they became the first, and to-date only, undergraduate organization to sponsor a scholarship for incoming students at the university.
History.
The Midnight Ramblers were founded in 1998 by Jon Huang, then a sophomore at the University of Rochester. Jon, an experienced a cappella singer who was eager to start his own musical group, dreamed of a group where academic and musical excellence would be equally encouraged, unlike many of the other extra-curricular musical ensembles on campus at the time. He also envisioned a group that would enhance school pride through active participation in official college events and continual involvement in the campus community. Lastly, Jon wanted to provide a unique opportunity for a new pool of talent, focusing on crowd-pleasing pop and rock styles instead of the classic a cappella repertoire. Inspired by the Rolling Stones title, Jon christened his creation “The Midnight Ramblers.” 
The nascent ensemble gave its first performance on April 30, 1998 in the Welles-Brown room in the University’s Rush Rhees Library. Their premiere set included “Some Kind of Wonderful”, “Good Lovin’”, “Truly Madly Deeply”, and “Everybody Wants to Rule the World”. This small private performance proved to be the first of many for the fledgling group.
Since their inception, the Ramblers have continually worked toward realizing Jon’s original goals of performance and innovation. In ten years, they have released eight full-length studio albums, including the newly debuted "Ça C'est Bon", which has garnered critical acclaim from across the a cappella community. Their music has been featured on numerous a cappella compilations including "Sing 3", "Sing 4", "Voices Only 2007", "Voices Only 2009", and "Best of College A cappella 2008". They also placed third in the nation at the 2005 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella finals held at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City.
Shows.
Each year the Ramblers perform regularly on the university campus, throughout the Rochester community, and across the country. Their largest concerts usually occur bi-annually towards the end of each fall and spring semester in the university’s 1,031 seat Strong Auditorium, the River Campus’s main performance venue. Each show traditionally has a “theme” which is played out over the course of concert through a series of videos and skits interspersed between sets of songs. These themes usually revolve around a common element of pop culture and/or TV and cinema, humorously rewritten to include the members of the group. Recent titles include “Midnight Ramblers of the Caribbean”, “Midnight Ramblers and the Chocolate Factory”, “Midnight Ramblers Horror Show”, and “The Midnight Ramblers Host Saturday Night Live”. Certain elements have made recurring appearances in these shows, especially though the interstitial short videos, including a stock footage clip of a building imploding and shots of River Campus food service workers, especially Wilson Commons cashier Dawn Marshall-Hosier. In 2006, a DVD compilation of these video shorts, as well as live concert footage, was released as "Midnight Ramblers: The DVD".
In recent years, the advertising for these major Ramblers performances has changed to include different activities connected to the show intended to provide additional entertainment for the University community. These activities have usually taken the form of a scavenger hunt, with clues posted on the concert fliers leading to hidden prizes around campus, or, occasionally, at nearby Rochester landmarks, such as the University of Rochester Medical Center. In addition, the Ramblers have also been joined on stage by various professional guest artists from around the world, including FORK from Helsinki, Finland in Fall 2008 and, most recently, multi-platinum 80s Latin pop star Alondra.
Tours.
Beginning in 2003, the Ramblers have gone on their annual Spring Break Tour each March. Specific destinations vary from year to year, though the group has performed up and down the east and west coasts, as well as in London, England in 2007. These tours usually consist primarily of workshops and performances at local schools, but have also featured National Anthem renditions for professional sporting events, live radio concerts, as well as other, less conventional, performances, such as serving as the headlining entertainment act at the Microsoft Corporation’s annual St. Patrick’s Day party. Highlights from these tours often make their way into subsequent performances, such as in 2004 when the group performed a 10 minute musical about their encounter with a deer on Alternate US 17 in South Carolina. The 2005 Spring Show, “The Real World”, based on the popular MTV reality show, featured video exclusively from the recent tour to Los Angeles.
The jersey.
One of the most recognizable traditions of the Midnight Ramblers is their unique performance garb, which consists of jeans, a t-shirt (occasionally matching, though this is not the case at most shows), and a grey baseball jersey featuring the word “Ramblers” on the front and the singer’s name and number on the back. In most cases, the singer’s last name is used, but certain members of the group have featured nicknames instead.
The jerseys are also regularly integrated into the Ramblers performances, being removed and repurposed as pants, blindfolds, turbans, or, when twisted up and used like a whip, weapons. Wearing the jerseys in public has occasionally caused the Ramblers to be mistaken for members of a baseball team, rather than a vocal ensemble. Critics of the jerseys have pointed out their similarity to those worn by the LA Dodgers.
Albums.
The Ramblers made their recording debut with their 1999 release "Now Playing". Since then, they have produced an additional seven studio albums, including their most recent full length CD, "Ça C'est Bon" and its corresponding B-Side "CCB-Sides" Also, to commemorate their tenth anniversary in the Spring of 2008, the Ramblers re-released specific tracks from all seven previous albums on "Anthology". All proceeds from sales of this disc have been used to sponsor a new University of Rochester scholarship for incoming students with musical backgrounds.
Philanthropy.
In recent years, the Ramblers have been pursuing increasing numbers of philanthropic projects. With help from their alumni and the UR office of admissions, the group now sponsors the Midnight Ramblers Scholarship, to be given for the first time to an incoming student from the class of 2013. Also, recordings of the Ramblers have been featured on "Ripple Effect", a compilation album released by Liquid 5th Productions in Fall 2008 to fund drilling for wells that will provide water for impoverished African villages. Most recently, in March 2009 the Ramblers spent their spring tour in New Orleans, Louisiana where they sang entirely "pro bono" leading workshops and performances for students at schools stricken by Hurricane Katrina. In addition to their vocal work on the tour, they also worked to help with the reconstruction of a house in St. Bernard Parish.
National exposure.
The Ramblers have been featured on a number of a cappella compilation albums alongside other collegiate and professional groups, including two appearances on "Best of College A cappella" first in 2001 and again in 2008. In December 2008, they recorded their version of "Army" with Ben Folds for inclusion on his upcoming album "" which consists entirely of a cappella covers of his music. Proceeds from the album go to benefit the Save the Music charity. To promote the album, the Ramblers appeared as the featured opening act at Folds performance at Rochester's Water Street Music Hall in March 2009.

21 cm Kanone 38

The 21 cm Kanone 38 (21 cm K 38) was a heavy gun used by Germany in World War II. Its development began in 1938 after Krupp's success with the 21 cm Mrs 18, but it was not fielded until 1941. It likely equipped "Artillerie-Abteilungen 767" and "768", which were the only "Heer" battalions to field 21 cm guns during the war. Some guns may have served on coastal defence duties as well.
Design and history.
It was generally similar in design to Krupp's 21 cm Mrs 18, but had an improved carriage that sped up emplacement and displacement times. It was transported in the customary two loads – barrel and carriage, although the carriage rode on two limbers. Each end of the carriage had inclined under-surfaces that rode on the limbers. When winched apart or together those inclined surfaces allowed the carriage to easily raise out of or lower into position. It fired from a central platform stabilized by three jacks which allowed all-around traverse.
Only eight were produced before the "Heer" decided 21 cm was an unsuitable caliber and canceled the remaining seven guns under contract. One gun was sent to Japan by submarine.
Ammunition.
The gun fired a 21 cm "K Gr 38" HE shell. It used three individual bags of propellant in the cartridge case; they were not combined. The "light load (Kleine Ladung)" weighed and propelled the shell at . The "medium load (Mittlere Ladung)" weighed and gave a muzzle velocity of . The "big load (Grosse Ladung)" weighed and yielded a muzzle velocity of .

Acorns Children's Hospice

Acorns Children's Hospice Trust is a registered charity, offering a network of care and support to life-limited and life-threatened children and their families across the heart of England. Acorns has three hospices, situated in Birmingham, Walsall and Worcester as well as a Community Team that offer support to families in their homes. The catchment area for the Hospices comprises the counties of Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire as well as parts of Staffordshire, Shropshire, and the West Midlands.
Installations.
Shops.
The Trust runs 46 shops across the "Heart of England." Acorns has the largest retail chain among children’s hospices and in 2009-2010 they raised over £1,000,000. The Trust's latest shop to open was in Bromsgrove, and this brings their total number to 55 .
Acorns have since opened another retail outlet in Station Road, Solihull, that deals in high-quality ladies' wear and fashionable accessories. However, owing to its popularity, management has now begun to stock several varieties of menswear items to satisfy local demand.
Aston Villa partnership.
Aston Villa F.C. have supported "Acorns" since 2006 and has already paid for 230 days' worth of hospice care. Several players have visited the children and families who use Acorns. Acorns highlighted the need for further assistance to aid the extra thousand children in the local area who needed the assistance of Acorns. Aston Villa responded by offering a platform to advertise the Hospice to a wider audience. On 7 July 2008, the club unveiled the kit for the 2008–09 season which has the Acorns logo in the position associated with the main kit sponsor. An Acorns spokesperson said "We are absolutely delighted that our logo will be seen at every home and away match during the 2008–09 season, helping to raise awareness of our work and of the constant need by all children’s hospices to fundraise. This really is the beginning of an amazing partnership, believed to be the first of its kind in the Premier League." The deal was extended for the 2009–10 season. For the 2010–11 season onwards, Acorns is Aston Villa's Official Charity Partner. When Marc Albrighton scored the 20,000th goal in Premier League history, he chose Acorn's as the charity to receive the £20,000 prize donation.

UK online centres coordinates a network of 5000 community partners, who provide free or low-cost access to computers and the internet. The organisation also provide training and support to hundreds of volunteers, centre staff and community leaders, helping them to work within their own communities. 
Over 1 million people have been helped to improve their skills through UK online centres to date, with many learners also going on to further learning and increased employment opportunities. 
In 2011 the management of the UK online centres network was taken over by OCF, a staff-owned mutual and social enterprise formed by the Sheffield-based team previously managing the UK online centres contract on behalf of Ufi Ltd. In July 2013, Online Centres Foundation became known as Tinder Foundation. 
Tinder Foundation Chief Executive, Helen Milner, was inducted into the BIMA Digital Hall of Fame in 2012 alongside Sir Tim Berners Lee, Stephen Fry, and others noted for their work in the digital arena. 
Online learning.
In April 2011, UK online centres launched a brand new learning platform Go ON, which was renamed Learn my way in 2012 (http://www.learnmyway.com/). The website was developed by UK online centres with the aim of bringing together all of the resources on the market for internet beginners, including those developed specifically by UK online centres, and from other providers including the BBC and Digital Unite. 
The new website contains four main sections:
Get started, which includes fun engagement resources to help get first time learners started.
Online basics, the course that was developed in conjunction with BIS and Becta to provide learners with all of the skills they need to get started with computers and the internet.
Learn more, which includes a number of popular courses including Facebook and socialising online, Shopping online and Using a computer.
What’s next, which contains resources to help learners progress, including details on volunteering opportunities.
myguide, the original learning platform which was developed by UK online centres ceased to exist in September 2011. The most popular courses that existed on myguide have been moved across to the new learning platform.
Get online week.
Get online week is an annual national campaign run by UK online centres, which helps tens of thousands of people to improve their computer and internet skills each year. 
In 2010, UK online centres partnered with many organisations to run Get online week, including the BBC, Race Online 2012, Post Offices, BT, Three Mobile, Google, Sky, and Facebook, getting nearly 80,000 people started with computers and the internet.
In 2011 Get online week followed a “Give an hour” theme, encouraging those with digital skills to help others.
Get online week 2012 was 15-21 October, and will take place between 14-20 October in 2013. 
Digital Inclusion Statistics.
There are currently 7.82 million people who have never used computers and the internet, and an estimated 14.5 million who don't have the skills to make the most of what the internet has to offer. These people are likely to be socially excluded as well as lacking in online skills. UK online centres, along with their partners, are aiming to combat this digital and social exclusion.

Second Battle of Manzanillo

The Second Battle of Manzanillo was a naval engagement of the Spanish American War on 1 July 1898. Two American gunboats attempted unsuccessfully to destroy the shipping present in the harbor of Manzanillo, Cuba.
The battle.
The and had arrived at Manzanillo on 1 July expecting to find an American squadron, but did not know that the squadron had fought a battle in the harbor and retired the previous day. The two vessels under Adolph Marix nonetheless decided to follow their orders and sailed into the bay to capture or destroy any enemy shipping there. In the harbor, they found several small vessels including the gunboats "Estrella" and "Guantánamo", the "Delgado Parejo", and a barracks ship. The Americans then proceeded to open fire on the vessels but could not get close enough to destroy them due to the shallow water that lay in between the two aggressors. Not only did the Spanish gunboats return fire, but infantry and artillery from the shore as well.
The Americans were outnumbered, and after "Scorpion" had been hit 12 times the attackers withdrew. "Osceola" was not hit and the Americans reported casualties, while Spanish casualties were three men wounded aboard the pontoon "María".
Aftermath.
As had occurred the day before, the Spanish had managed to repel the American squadron. Wrote one American sailor:
"Scorpion" and "Osceola" met up with the squadron that had attacked the previous day and waited for reinforcements to arrive, before finally managing to destroy the Spanish naval force at Manzanillo on 18 July.

William Cowherd

Reverend William Cowherd (1763 – 1816) was a Christian minister serving a congregation in the City of Salford, immediately west of Manchester, and one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society founded in 1847. Cowherd advocated and encouraged members of his then small group of followers, known as 'Cowherdites' to abstain from the eating of meat as a form of temperance.
Early life.
After teaching philology at Beverley he came to Manchester and became curate to the Rev. John Clowes at St John's church. Having studied the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg he like Clowes adopted Swedenborgian doctrine and preached at the Swedenborgian church, Peter Street. He is said to have been the only man to read the Latin writings of Swedenborg in their entirety.
Bible Christian Church.
In 1800 he established a new congregation in Salford, building the chapel at his own expense. His chapel, called Christ Church, was located in King Street, Salford, just across the River Irwell from Manchester. Believing that ministers should maintain themselves he conducted a school and practised as a physician from time to time. In 1809 he promulgated the doctrine that people should "eat no more meat till the world endeth" and abstain from alcoholic drinks.
The denomination he founded was known as the Bible Christian Church (not to be confused with Methodist sect of the same name based in the South-west of England). His early ideas and insight into the abstinence from eating meat, provided the basis for early ideas about vegetarianism. This message was later preached in the U.S. as some 41 members of the Bible Christian Church crossed the Atlantic in 1817.
Cowherd is credited with being the main figure advocating the theory of vegetarianism. It is noted that he asked his congregation in a sermon preached on January 18, 1809, to refrain from eating meat which culminated in the founding of the Vegetarian Society in 1847.
Library.
A compilation called "Facts Authentic in Science and Religion towards a new Translation of the Bible" which he had compiled was printed after his death. He left his personal library to the chapel and it was transferred to the new Bible Christian chapel in Cross Lane. According to William Axon "It was at one time a circulating library, accessible to the public upon easy terms, but the books are not such as can be read by those who run." It was a scholar's library, strong in theology (including the London polyglott edition of the Bible, 1657), with some mystical works and books on health from the 17th century and later.

Pool factor

In finance, a pool factor is the amount of the initial principal left in a mortgage-backed security. It is expressed as a factor of one that is used to indicate the remaining principal balance. Pool factors are only used to describe specific classes of securities, namely pooled asset-backed securities (ABSs) and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) whose component payments are returned to investors on a monthly basis. Pool factors are published monthly in the US for Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities.
Calculation.
To calculate the pool factor,
For example, a pool factor of 0.523 indicates that for each note of $10,000, $4,770 of principal has been repaid.
If one multiplies the original face value of mortgage back security with the pool factor we get the current face value.
Usage.
Asset-backed securities and MBSs typically contain issue terms that specify a method through which redeeming principal is shared among investors. When redemption is done pro-rata, a pool factor is useful to investors in cases of early repayment. Early repayment reduces the amount of collateral available for an issue, and therefore some of the outstanding principal is returned to investors as stated in the issue terms. In this case, the pool factor is used to indicate how the remaining outstanding principal is adequately securitized.

A recent example is the mapping of the residences of U.S. Facebook users and their social links [http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/02/how-to-split-up-the-us.html].
In "marketing" a social map is a visualized analysis of a digital identity of a person, brand or company. A social map shows exactly where a digital identity is created, formed or discussed and sets each element in context and proportions.
These social map created an intense discussion about digital reputation and digital identities. For companies a so-called Corporate Social Map is still very new and an unusual methodology, but also very effective and meaningful.

Fred Talbot (baseball)

Frederick Lealand Talbot (June 28, 1941 - January 11, 2013), was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He pitched from 1963-1970 for the New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, Seattle Pilots, Chicago White Sox, and Oakland Athletics. He attended Fairfax High School in Fairfax, Virginia. 
Talbot is one of the more memorable Pilots in Jim Bouton's book "Ball Four". Bouton had a somewhat antagonistic relationship with Talbot dating back to their days as Yankee teammates, but Talbot's near-constant stream of funny stories and put-downs leads Bouton to admit, "Talbot is in rare form these days." Talbot would go on to be traded to Oakland only five days after Bouton was traded to the Houston Astros.

Stage Show (TV series)

Stage Show was a popular music variety series on American television originally hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. Produced by Jackie Gleason, the CBS-TV show included the first national television appearances by Elvis Presley.
The series began as a one-hour show on July 3, 1954 as a summer replacement for "The Jackie Gleason Show". Gleason brought it back in the fall of 1955 as a half-hour show and scheduled it from 8–8:30 p.m. ET before his own program on Saturday nights.
In 1956, Jack Carter, a frequent guest, became the permanent host. The June Taylor Dancers made regular appearances. Bobby Darin made his national TV debut on the program in early 1956, singing "Rock Island Line".
The show's final telecast was September 18, 1956.
Elvis Presley appearances.
Introduced by Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley first appeared on January 28, 1956, performing "Shake, Rattle and Roll", "Flip, Flop and Fly" and "I Got a Woman". He made five more appearances during the next eight weeks:
These shows were preserved on kinescopes and released on home video.

Scathophaga stercoraria

Scathophaga stercoraria, commonly known as the yellow dung fly or the golden dung fly, is one of the most familiar and abundant flies in many parts of the northern hemisphere. As its common name suggests, it is often found on the feces of large mammals, such as horses, cows, sheep, deer, and wild boar, where it goes to breed. The distribution of "Scathophaga stercoraria" is likely influenced by human agriculture, especially in Northern Europe and North America. Scathophaga are integral in the animal kingdom due to their role in the natural erosion of dung in fields. They are also very important in the scientific world due to their short life cycles and susceptibility to experimental manipulations, and have thus contributed significant knowledge about animal behavior.
Description.
"Scathophaga stercoraria" are sexually dimorphic insects with an average lifespan of one to two months. The adult males of "Scathophaga stercoraria" are bright golden-yellow with orange-yellow fur on the front legs. Females are a little duller in color, with pronounced green-brown tinges, and no brightly colored fur on the front legs. The adults range from 5 mm to 11 mm in length, and the males are generally larger than the females. The physical features of separate "Scathophaga stercoraria" populations can vary greatly, due in part to the range of locations in which the species is found. Generally, they are located in cooler temperate regions, including North America, Asia, and Europe. They may also favor higher latitudes, such as the Swiss Alps, and higher altitudes, such as the Pyrenees.
Feeding.
The adults mainly prey on smaller insects — mostly other Diptera. They can also consume nectar and dung as additional sources of energy. In a laboratory setting, adult "S. stercoraria" can live off of solely "Drosophila" and water. Females spend most of their time foraging in the surrounding vegetation and only visit dung pats to mate and oviposit on the dung surface. Both males and females are attracted to dung by scent, and approach dung pats against the wind. Males will spend most of their time on the cow pats, waiting for females and feeding on other insects that visit the dung, such as blow-flies. In the absence of other prey, the yellow dung fly will turn to cannibalism. The “S. stercoraria” larva are coprophagous, relying on the dung pat for nutrition.
Reproduction.
"S. stercoraria" will breed on the dung of many large mammals, but generally prefer fresh cow pats. The operational sex ratio on these pats is very male biased and competition is high. Females are small and have limited pre-copulatory choice. Copulation lasts 20–50 minutes, after which the male will attempt to guard the female from other males. Both males and females will often mate multiply. Reproductive success depends on a variety of factors, including sperm competition, nutrition, and environmental temperature
Anatomy.
Females have paired accessory glands, which supply lubricants to the reproductive system and secrete protein-rich egg shells. Sperm is received in a large structure called the bursa copulatrix, and is stored in a structure called the spermatheca. "Scathophaga" have three spermathecae, (one pair and one singlet), each with its own narrow duct that connects it to the bursa. Sperm can be stored in the spermathecae for days, weeks, or even years, and sperm from several males can be stored simultaneously.
Males have two projections, the paralobes, which are used to hold onto a female during copulation. Between the paralobes is the intromittent organ, the aedeagus, which transfers sperm into the female's bursa copulatrix.
Behavior.
During copulation, sperm are not directly deposited into sperm-storing organs. Ejaculation occurs in the bursa copulatrix, and then females actively move sperm into the spermathecae using their muscular spermathecal invagination to pump sperm into transit. This gives females a level of control over which and how much sperm enters her system, an example of cryptic female choice. Although current results are inconclusive regarding whether or not females are cryptically selecting for a better phenotypic match, it has been suggested that a female benefits from having variable sperm fertilizing her offspring. Such adaptations are advantageous because females benefit from being able to control which sperm are successful in fertilizing eggs. It may not be that the females are aware of which sperm are better suited for her offspring, but simply that being able to control the proportion of sperm from multiple mates can maximize the possibility of an optimal phenotypic match. It is to her advantage to have multiple males’ sperms reach her eggs, rather than just one.
After copulation females prefer to lay their eggs on the small hills of the dung surface, avoiding depressions and pointed areas. This survival strategy aims to prevent desiccation and drowning so that the eggs are placed where they will have the greatest chance of reaching adulthood.
Sexual Conflict.
Countless studies have looked at the many manifestations of sexual conflict, including postmating sexual selection, in the yellow dung fly. Sperm competition occurs when a female mates with multiple males. Each male's sperm is then in direct competition to fertilize the eggs.
Sperm mix quickly once they reach the female's stores. The goal of males is to displace the sperm of other males as much as possible. Larger males tend to have longer copulation times and greater rates of sperm displacement. The fertilization success of males that were secondary mates increased as their body size relative to the first male increased.
Traits such as body size, testis size, and sperm length are variable as well as heritable in "S. stercoraria" males, Larger sperm may be advantageous if they have greater propulsion along the female's spermathecal duct, resulting in higher fertilization success rates. When competition among males is high and females are mating with multiple males, those with the largest testes also have the most success in terms of proportion of sperm that fertilize a female’s eggs. The resulting male offspring would then have a similar advantage.
A positive correlation was found between sperm length of males and spermathecal duct length of females. The size of male testis was also positively correlated with female spermathecae size. Additionally, females with larger spermathecae are better able to produce spermicidal secretion. This cryptic female choice betters their ability to influence paternity over their offspring. These covariances are an example of an “evolutionary arms race.” This suggests that each sex evolves certain traits to undermine the beneficial traits of the other, resulting in the coevolution of male and female reproductive systems of "S. stercoraria."
Life Cycle.
The eggs that the female lays on the dung pat will hatch into larvae after 1–2 days, depending on temperature. The larvae quickly burrow into the dung for protection and feed on it. At 20 °C, larvae undergo three molts over five days, during which they grow exponentially. After growth, larvae spend another five days emptying their stomachs before pupation, where no additional body mass is gained. After 10–20 days the larvae burrow into the soil around and beneath the dung and pupate. The time needed for the juvenile flies to emerge can vary from 10 days at 25 °C to 80 days at 10 °C or less. The smaller females typically emerge a few days before the males. The fitness of the resulting juveniles is greatly dependent on the quality of the dung in which they were placed. Factors affecting dung quality include water content, nutritional quality, parasites, and drugs or other chemicals given to the animal. 
Yellow dung flies are anautogenous. In order to become sexually mature and produce viable eggs or sperm they must feed on prey to acquire sufficient proteins and lipids. Females under nutritional stress will have higher rates of egg mortality and less survival of offspring to adult emergence. "Scathophaga stercoraria" can then produce anywhere from 4 to 10 clutches per lifetime. The adults are active throughout much of the year in most moderate climates.
Phenology.
Yellow dung fly viability depends strongly on the environment. In warmer climates, there is often a sharp population decline in the summer months, when the temperature increases above 25 °C. Meanwhile, there is no population decline in colder climates, such as Iceland, Finland, northern England, and high elevations. Additionally, the number of generations per year varies with altitude and latitude, typically between two and four overlapping generations. The end of winter synchronizes the first emergence in March, and the overwinter generations are produced in the fall. In northern Europe, where the mating season is shorter, only one or two generations can be expected.
Phenotypic Plasticity.
Yellow dung flies have extremely variable phenotypes, body size and development rate in particular. Proximate causes of variation include: juvenile nutrition, temperature, predation, and genetic variation. Much phenotypic plasticity in yellow dung flies is a result of food (dung) availability in the larval stage, which is often mediated by conspecific competition. Experimentation shows that less dung, more competitors, and more pat drying all result in decreased growth rate and adult body size. Additionally, when exposed to constant temperatures in a laboratory setting, higher temperatures during growth yield smaller flies. Egg volume, but not clutch size, also decreases with increasing temperature. Giving merit to the hypothesis that constraints on physiological processes at the cellular level account for temperature-mediated body size, studies have also shown that "S. stercoraria" body size varies via gene-by-environment interactions. Different cell lines vary significantly in growth, development, and adult body size in response to food limitation.
Geographic Variation.
"S. stercoraria's" phenotype has been shown to vary seasonally, latitudinally, and altitudinally. Seasonal variation occurs in "S. stercoraria" as a result an adaptive response to time constraints on development due to temperature changes. In the fall, as the temperature becomes cooler, the flies are able to increase development rate, so they can achieve the necessary, albeit smaller than average, size. Furthermore, "S. stercoraria" development rate increases with increasing latitude. This is likely an adaptive response to shorter mating seasons. Body size, but not development rate, vary with altitude. Dung flies are larger at higher altitudes as a result of colder temperatures.
Reasons behind Phenotypic Plasticity.
Larger yellow dung flies have a competitive advantage. Therefore, body size plasticity must be a survival mechanism. Studies show that offspring of large adults still survive under food limitations, despite needing more nutrients for a longer development. Thus, the observed growth plasticity is a result of altering body chemistry and not differing survival rates of offspring from small and large parents. Plastic development rate and body size are effective at avoiding premature death, meaning "S. stercoraria" adopt a strategy of being small and alive over large and dead. Smaller flies have an advantage in stressful environmental situations, due to larger dung flies needing more energy. Additionally, there is low genetic differentiation between yellow dung fly populations, likely due to extensive gene flow, as "S. stercoraria" are able to travel great distances. When species are unable to adapt through genetics, phenotypic plasticity is the most viable option to adjust to changing environments. Yellow dung flies develop in extremely variable environments, with pat drying, dung availability, and larvae competition hindering survival. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity allows "S. stercoraria" to adjust development according to unpredictable ecological situations without genetic adaptation.
Parasites and diseases.
Since 'Scathophaga stercoraria' is a synanthropic fly, it does carry the risk of passively contaminating human food with various pathogens, molds, or yeasts.
There are some known sexually transmitted diseases of insects, particularly in Coleoptera, Similar diseases have also been studied in 'Scathophaga stercoraria'. Many of these sexually transmitted diseases are from multicellular ectoparasites (mites), protists or the fungus "Entomophthora muscae". These are frequently responsible for either sterilizing or killing the host fly.
Predators.
Besides being an easy meal for a great many bird and bat species, they are also preyed upon by other insects. There is much competition between different species of larvae within a dung pat. Other insect species may also view the pats as ideal hunting grounds. These can include robber flies, and clown beetles.
Use as a Model Organism.
Like "Drosophila melanogaster", the yellow dung fly is an ideal model organism due to its short life span and susceptibility to various experimental manipulations. Initial interest in yellow dung flies came from their potential as bio-control agents against pest-flies around livestock. In the past 40 years alone, countless studies have used "S. stercoraria" to research topics such as sperm competition, mating behavior, sexual conflict, reproductive physiology, thermal biology, and genetics. In particular, research on yellow dung flies has contributed greatly to understanding of multiple mating systems and sperm competition.
Recently, "S. stercoraria" was approved by the government as a standard required test species for eco-toxicological testing. This includes evaluating the residues of veterinary drugs in livestock dung. Yellow dung flies are a key part of decomposing waste in pastures which is key to preventing the spread of endoparasites and returning nutrients to the soil. The species’ diet also serves to reduce the abundance of pest flies. To test a chemical's toxicity, the chemical is mixed with bovine faeces, to which yellow dung fly eggs are added. Then, endpoints, such as sex and number of emerged adult flies, retardation of emergence, morphological change, and developmental rate, are measured and analyzed to determine toxicity. A great deal of research has been done on the effects of avermectins on populations of "S. stercoraria". Avermectins are drugs used to control endoparasites in livestock. The resulting dung contains drug residues that can have unintentional adverse effects on yellow dung fly populations, such as increased mutations and decreased offspring viability. If the use of such drugs in agriculture is not carefully monitored, there could be considerable economic losses.

Antonio Fabrés

Antonio Maria Fabrés y Costa (1854–1938), also known as Antonio Fabrés, was a famous Spanish artist during the turn of the 20th century. He was born in Barcelona Spain in 1854. It is said that he was the artist gene since his father was a draughtsman and his uncle a silversmith. He started studying at the Escuela de Bellas Artes in his native city at the age of 13. When he turned 21, he received a grant to study in Rome. There are records of his sculptures from early in his career but later on he became a painter almost exclusively. He joined Mariano Fortuny with a group that became known for their intense realism. Their popularity grew with the taste of the bourgeoisie seeking exotic images with oriental of medieval themes. He went back to Barcelona in 1886 and in 1894 he moved to Paris. The popularity he had earned during his decade in Italy helped him open a large studio where he could create complex scenes for the upper classes. 
In 1902 the Academia de San Carlos decided to renovate their classical techniques with the ones of realism that were so popular in Europe at the time. Antonio Fabrés was called to take the place of Santiago Rebull as head of this important institution. Although some of his students went on to become what was later known as the Post-Revolutionary Movement in Mexican art, the faculty had a hard time adapting to his distinct style and personality. In 1907, he returned to Rome. One of his last commissions in Mexico was the decorations of a hall at the Porfirio Diaz mansion where he mainly focused on art nouveau style .
Fabrés was recognized most everywhere he traveled. He was acclaimed in Barcelona, London, Paris, Vienna and Lyon. At the end of his life he was dealt a very unfortunate blow when in 1926 he decided to donate a large amount of works to the Museo de Bellas Artes de Barcelona. In exchange for this generous donation he asked the Museum that a hall be built with his name, but the museum never built that hall and although he protested several times, they could never settle the argument. Antonio Fabrés died in Rome in 1938.

Kartanoism

Kartanoism (Kartanolaisuus) was a Christian sect in the 1920s through the 1950s in Finland, mostly in the Satakunta region. The main centres of influence were Huittinen and Vampula, which were considered the "mother parishes" of the movement, but Kartanoism was also present in at least Kangasniemi, Lavia, Sippola and Juupajoki. The leaders of the movement were Alma Maria Kartano (1885-1953) and the "sleeping preacher" Amanda Matilda "Tilda" Reunanen (1894-1965). At first, they led the movement together, but later their paths separated because of personal arguments.
The movement was most famous for its child preachers. These child preachers, trained in secret, numbered around ten. At its largest, the movement had around one hundred members, but its societies all over Finland gathered large crowds, even over one thousand. As well as the child preachers, the movement was known for Tilda Reunanen's spirited sermons.
Alma Kartano, the founder of the movement, had studied in the Sortavala deaconess academy, but she never graduated as a deaconess. After this, she took a one-year travelling school teacher course in the Hämeenlinna teachers' seminar. She stayed in Inkerinmaa for long times, where the local preacher Voldemar Kurki introduced her to the Russian skoptsy - "castrater" and khlysts - "spanker" communities. Becoming acquintated with these movements convinced Kartano that all kinds of sexuality were evil, even when in marriage.
The sermons of Kartanoism were best known for significant coverage of waiting for the end of the world. The second coming of Jesus was thought to be coming immediately, and before it, the sinful world would receive its punishment. The Winter War provided a good reason to declare that the Wrath of God would be wrought upon the infidels. The Kartanoists themselves thought they had founded a bridal parish for the end of times, which Jesus would embrace as his own when he came. On the other hand, Kartanoism did not try to organise itself to a separate community, instead its members stayed within the Lutheran church.
Kartanoist life was strictly asceticist, including most of all total sexual abstinence, even in marriage. Women were forced to wear dark-coloured clothes, cover their heads in scarves and dress in long dresses, to avoid rousing sexual urges in men. Children were raised severely, even cruelly. The movement held prayer and sermon meetings, which could last well into the night. They included long kneeling prayers, preferably with the face pressed into the floor, and praying in such a loud voice "that the devil would flee away". The prayer meetings would often end in ecstatic experiences, where participants banged their heads and hands on the floor, shouted and wailed, had visions, spoke in tongues and prophesied.
Kartanoism received negative publicity already in the 1930s because of a certain trial, and in 1938 writer Eino Hosia from Satakunta published a novel called "Tulipunaiset ratsastajat" ("The scarlet riders"), criticising the movement. After this, the movement received negative publicity in various other contexts as well. After Alma Kartano's death, the movement faded away. There are currently very few Kartanoists, and they are usually integrated into the local Lutheran parishes.

Direct Anonymous Attestation

The Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a cryptographic protocol which enables the remote authentication of a trusted platform whilst preserving the user's privacy. The protocol has been adopted by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) in the latest version of its Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specification as a result of privacy concerns (see also Loss of Internet anonymity).
Historical perspective.
In principle the privacy issue could be resolved using any standard signature scheme (or public key encryption) and a single key pair. Manufacturers would embed the private key into every TPM produced and the public key would be published as a certificate. Signatures produced by the TPM must have originated from the private key, by the nature of the technology, and since all TPMs use the same private key they are indistinguishable ensuring the user's privacy. This rather naive solution relies upon the assumption that there exists a "global secret". One only needs to look at the precedent of Content Scramble System (CSS), an encryption system for DVDs, to see that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore this approach fails to realize a secondary goal: the ability to detect rogue TPMs. A rogue TPM is a TPM that has been compromised and had its secrets extracted.
The solution first adopted by the TCG (TPM specification v1.1) required a trusted third-party, namely a "privacy certificate authority" (privacy CA). Each TPM has an embedded RSA key pair called an Endorsement Key (EK) which the privacy CA is assumed to know. In order to attest the TPM generates a second RSA key pair called an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). It sends the public AIK, signed by EK, to the privacy CA who checks its validity and issues a certificate for the AIK. (For this to work, either a) the privacy CA must know the TPM's public EK "a priori", or b) the TPM's manufacturer must have provided an "endorsement certificate".) The host/TPM is now able to authenticate itself with respect to the certificate. This approach permits two possibilities to detecting rogue TPMs: firstly the privacy CA should maintain a list of TPMs identified by their EK known to be rogue and reject requests from them, secondly if a privacy CA receives too many requests from a particular TPM it may reject them and blacklist the TPMs EK. The number of permitted requests should be subject to a risk management exercise. This solution is problematic since the privacy CA must take part in every transaction and thus must provide high availability whilst remaining secure. Furthermore privacy requirements may be violated if the privacy CA and verifier collude. Although the latter issue can probably be resolved using blind signatures, the first remains.
Overview.
The DAA protocol is based on three entities and two different steps. The entities are the TPM platform, the DAA Issuer and the DAA verifier. The issuer is charged to verify the TPM platform during the Join step and to issue DAA credential to the platform. The platform uses the DAA credential with the verifier during the Sign step. Through a zero-knowledge proof the verifier can verify the credential without attempting to violate the platform's privacy. The protocol also supports a blacklisting capability so that verifiers can identify attestations from TPMs that have been compromised.
Privacy properties.
The protocol allows differing degrees of privacy. Interactions are always anonymous, but the user/verifier may negotiate as to whether the verifier is able to link transactions. This would allow user profiling and/or the rejection of requests originating from a host which has made too many requests.

Type 77 pistol

The Type 77 () is a 7.65x17 mm Type 64 caliber semi-automatic pistol in service with all branches of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the People's Republic of China, People's Armed Police and various Chinese police forces. The Type 77 has been the main sidearm of the PLA for over two decades and is slowly being phased out by the QSZ-92 pistol in both military and police service but is still in widespread use across the country amongst second line military units and provincial police forces. Beginning in 1990, several variants of the Type 77 were developed for the international market.
History.
Following the successful development of the Type 64 pistol and the silenced Type 64 and Type 67 pistols, the Jinan Military Region Ordnance Factory began development of a self-defense weapon for officers, armed police and public security police in 1976 and by 1978 a design for the new side arm had been selected. In 1981 the design had been finalized for production and was designated as the Type 77.
Design details.
The Type 77 pistol is a compact, pocket-sized, blowback-operated handgun that fires the indigenously developed 7.62x17mm Type 64 pistol round, which was originally created for the Type 64 pistol. The Type 77 utilizes a striker-fired single action firing mechanism and is carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber.
The Type 77 has both a forward blade front sight with a slight taper and a rear, fixed notch.
The magazine seems to be derived from the Czechoslovakian vz. 52 and is a single-stacked box magazine that carries seven rounds and is released by a button on the left side of the frame on the trigger guard below the actual trigger. A lanyard ring is located at the bottom of the grip. The frame is covered by a one-piece plastic wrap-around grip retained by a single screw. The grip is marked with a single five-pointed star in a circle on each side.
The most unique feature of the Type 77 is the use of an obscure, system of operation developed in the early 20th century by firearms designer, Witold Chylewski, and first manufactured under Louis Schmeisser and later Hugo Schmeisser's Theodor Bergmann Waffenfabrik, a German arms manufacturing company.
This German 'Einhand' system allows the user to single-handedly chamber a cartridge by pulling the trigger guard back, which is connected to the slide. This pulling action will retract the slide back against the return spring. When the trigger guard is released, the slide will return and chamber the cartridge almost instantaneously. The chamber is fluted to reduce slide recoil, this reduces gas pressure acting on the base of the cartridge case. The trigger is then pulled to fire in single-action and the trigger guard is then automatically locked forward as to not strain the index finger during normal firing. An advantage of this system is that misfired cartridges can be quickly discharged with only one hand. If one prefers to carry with a loaded chamber, a traditional, manual safety exists above the left grip panel on the frame.
Recently, China has begun importing the Israeli CornerShot gun system for the People's Armed Police, and at the same time, began developing its own modifications of the weapon for the Type 79 submachine gun. The CornerShot Type 79 has been slightly modified to house the Cornershot system and most notably mounts a Type 77 pistol in a special, rotating mount, placed under the barrel that also houses a tactical flashlight. This rotating mount allows the user to fire the pistol and the submachine gun independently of each other. In addition the entire barrel of the Type 79 can also turn left or right, with the user able to see around corners thanks to a small camera attached to a side mounted LCD screen.
Variants.
There are five variants of the Type 77 pistol, three of which (NP-20, NP-24 and NP-24A) are based on the M-77B variant. All variants of the Type 77 except the Type 77-1 are for export only and not in use domestically in China, neither with military nor with police.
M-77.
The M-77 (Model 77) is an exact copy of the Type 77, made by Norinco. It is meant for export, rather than internal use.
M-77B.
The M-77B (Model 77B) is a highly modified variant of the Type 77 pistol and was developed in 1991. It is often marketed as a 'Chinese Military' Pistol, regardless of the fact that it is not in fact used by the People's Liberation Army. The M-77B is a single-action pistol and weighs twice as much as the original Type 77 and is over forty millimeters longer. The frame and slide are made from forged carbon steel and the grip panels are of polymer construction which are placed on a curved back strap grip. The M-77B is designed to fire the 9x19mm Parabellum round. As the Parabellum round is much more powerful than the 7.62×17 mm Type 64, the M-77B uses a gas-delayed blowback action to reduce recoil and has a fixed barrel. The gas cylinder is located under the barrel and the gas piston is connected to the slide. The M-77B retains the Type 77's unique 'trigger guard cocking system'. There is a thumb and magazine safety and a fixed, forward, and adjustable three-dot sights rear sights. The magazine uses a single stacked nine-round magazine.
NP-20, NP-24 and NP-24A.
The NP-20 pistol is a variant of the M-77B developed in 1993. The pistol is also made from forged steel construction. The NP-20 series is often marketed as a 'Chinese Police' but the NP-20 series is not in use with any police service or People's Armed Police unit in China. The only difference between the M-77B and the NP-20 is the removal of the 'trigger guard cocking system' on the latter. The NP-24 pistol (sometimes referred to as the M-77B2) is another variant of the M-77B developed in 1995. The difference between the M-77B and the NP-24 is the removal of the 'trigger guard cocking system' and replacement of the original nine round magazine with a double stacked fifteen round magazine. The NP-24A pistol is a variant of the NP-24 pistol developed in 1998 and is made from a high quality aluminum alloy. The NP24A is .85g lighter than the NP24.
Type 77-1.
The Type 77-1 is a variant of the Type 77 pistol which is designed for export and internal use. The Type 77-1 pistol was introduced in 1988 and differs from the Type 77 due to its, a strengthened grip and an eight round magazine capacity. Very little information has been released on this variant.

Hector Neil McLarty

Hector Neil McLarty (15 March 1851 - 24 November 1912) was a Western Australian Police officer, and customs detective. During his service as a police officer he accompanied future Premier John Forrest on two expeditions and was in charge of the officers attempting to capture the Fenian escapees on the Catalpa.
Personal life.
McLarty married Elizabeth Campbell in March 1875, they had six children, three boys and three girls. The eldest Campbell McLarty was one of the pastrolists to open up the north west of Western Australia for graziers. Roy McLarty received the Military Medal at Gallipoli and went on to become the Chief Executive for the AMP Society. His youngest son Duncan Keith was killed in action on 25 September 1915 a during the Battle of Loos.
The youngest of his daughters, Muriel Eileen McLarty, was the oldest surviving McLarty to attend the National Trust of Australia official opening of Old Blythewood homestead near Pinjarra by Governor Wallace Kyle. Old Blythewood was built Hector McLarty's father John in 1851 and was given to the National Trust by the McLarty family in 1974.
Police Officer.
Hector McLarty joined the Western Australian Police in June 1868 at the age of 17 years. In March 1870, as a police constable, he was part of John Forrest's expedition to survey a route for the first overland telegraph. The expedition plan was to start at Esperance tracing the route of John Eyre's previous crossing from Adelaide, South Australia to Esperance. They arrived at the Dempster farm in Esperance in April to replenish before commencing the successful expedition, returning from Adelaide by steamship in September 1870. Between August and November 1871 the same expedition party returned to Esperance explore pastoral land they had identified north-northeast of Esperance during the first expedition.
McLarty was promoted to Sargeant on 25 May 1874 while assigned to Perth's central police station. On 17 April 1876 McLarty led a group of 8 men, 2 pensioner guards from Perth and 6 police constables from Fremantle in pursuit of the six Fenian prisoners that had escaped from the Fremantle Prison. They boarded the "Georgette" in Perth steamed out of the Swan river in search of the "Catalpa"; unsuccessful, they returned that night to Fremantle to refuel. They recommenced the search the following day, successfully finding the "Catalpa", firing a shot across at the vessel the ordered it to stop or they would sink it. Captain of the "Catalpa" pointed at the United States flag and indicated that they were in international waters and that such action would be an act of war. The "Georgette" then returned to Fremantle; in his report on the incident McLarty wrote of the frustration and humiliation of letting the "Catapla" sail away.
In 1883 McLarty moved to Albany while there here sent a telegraph to Esperance instructing Lance Corporal Truslove to intercept suspected bushranger James Cody, who was accused of stealing two horses. When Truslove caught Cody he refused to stop; Truslove then shot Cody. Taking him to Dempster property in Esperance for treatment, and despite the aid of a doctor giving instructions via telegraph from Albany, Cody died ten days later. At the age of 33, Hector McLarty retired from the police force on 29 February 1884.
Later career.
Hector McLarty moved his family to the timber town of Canning Mills in the Darling Scarp. There he worked for the Western Australian Government Railways on the Eastern Railway, while his wife was the Postmistress for the town during the early 1890s. McLarty then took up a position as a detective with the Western Australian Customs on 1 July 1895. As part of the Federation of Australia the WA Customs service was amalgamated with similar services in the other States to form the Australian Customs Service, Hector remained with the ACS until he retired on 30 June 1911.

Passive Resistance (Hungary)

Passive Resistance ("passzív ellenállás") is a name attributed to an era of Hungarian politics in the 19th century. It refers to a form of opposition to Austrian domination of Hungary. "Passive resistance" refers in this case to the reluctance of any notable and prestigious personalities to take any position or office or to otherwise engage in politics, and also to certain other acts of non-cooperation. This approach characterized Hungarian public life between 1849 and 1865, with a brief intermezzo in 1860-61. In Hungarian historical context, therefore, the meaning of the term passive resistance is slightly different from in other contexts. Passive resistance, including in the forms practised in Hungary in this period, represents one form of the broader phenomenon of civil resistance.
First stage - 1849-1860.
Passive resistance began immediately after the 1848-1849 war of independence was crushed by the Austrians and Russians in August 1849, and became crystallized as a movement under the "leadership" of Ferenc Deák, a former moderate leader of the Reformist party in the 1840s. In 1850 Austrian minister of justice Anton von Schmerling requested Deák to participate in a committee of the legislation in order to bring about consolidation between Austria and Hungary. Deák's response ("After the dismal events in the near past, under the circumstances that still prevail, my cooperation in public matters is impossible") was widely distributed in secret and served as a call for other notables to join Deák's passive resistance. The journal Pesti Napló, edited by novelist Zsigmond Kemény became the chief organ of the movement, which was instrumental in keeping up hope and spirit in a Hungary fully incorporated into Austria and characterized by reprisals against political dissidents, thousands of treason trials, military governance, centralization, absolutism, censorship and direct control of Vienna over every aspect of public life.
Deák, Kemény and other leaders of the resistance carefully avoided any political agitation or criticism of the establishment (which was impossible anyway), and, strictly in the framework of civic organizations, concentrated on national issues of non-political nature, such as the use of the Hungarian language, development of the Hungarian economy, and protection of the legal standing of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Their followers, a considerable part of the intelligentisa and the landed gentry, either completely withdrew to private life or similarly limited themselves to non-political activities and, through various means of civil disobedience, refused to lend support or recognition to the authorities. Through their non-cooperation they managed to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the institutions of the Austrian oppression, which came to be dependent on foreign (mostly Czech) civil servants and discredited collaborationists collectively known by the sobriquet "Bach hussars". (Alexander Bach was Austrian minister of the interior at the time with the mission of transforming Hungarian public administration in such a way that all chance for commotion should be eradicated; the 1850s are therefore also referred to as "Bach era" in Hungarian historiography.)
Besides the absence of authentic personalities from state institutions, passive resistance was increasingly characterised by a widespread refusal to pay taxes, avoidance of military service and desertion.
Political events of 1860-1861.
By the beging of the decade, the worsening diplomatic isolation of Austria and events such as the 1859 Second Italian War of Independence undermined the Habsburg Empire militarily and financially, increasing Vienna's willingness to come to a compromise with the Hungarians. In 1859 Bach, the symbol of repression was dismissed; this, and the issuance of two successive "constitutions" for the Empire (the October Diploma and the February Patent, issued in 1860 and 1861, respectively) paved the way for Hungarian political leaders Ferenc Deák and József Eötvös to abandon their passive resistance and actively engage in politics again at the Diet convened by the Emperor on 2 April 1861.
However, the Hungarian Estates and the Viennese Court were unable to arrive at an agreement. The constitution proposed by Emperor Francis Joseph was seen as curbing Hungarian autonomy to an extent unacceptable by Hungarians, many of whom were still unwilling to give up their hopes of seceding Hungary from Austria entirely. The constitution was therefore rejected by the Diet, which was, in turn, dissolved by the Emperor with the threat of military violence.
Road to the Compromise.
After the dissolution of the Diet, Deák resumed his policies of passive resistance; however, political fermentation started in 1860-61 proved unstoppable. Deák expressed his willingness to resume negotiations with Vienna in his famous 1865 article (the so-called Easter article), marking the end of the era of passive resistance.
The worsening politico-military situation of the Empire, especially the disastrous defeat in the Austro-Prussian War strengthened the support of reform in Vienna, while the diminishing moral and financial reserves of the Hungarian nobility also proved instrumental in bringing the majority of Hungarian leaders to acquiescing in their inability of achieving the complete independence of Hungary. The necessity of coming to a modus vivendi was therefore increasingly accepted by both parties; eventually, these tendencies and the interdependence of Austria and Hungary led to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the creation of Austria-Hungary.
The Passive Resistance as seen in Ireland.
The period of passive resistance in Hungary from 1849 to 1867 attracted the interest of one prominent Irish nationalist, Arthur Griffith, who was a leading figure in the Sinn Féin movement from 1905 onwards, and who was later to be the Irish Foreign Secretary. He wrote a notable book, published in 1904, on "Resurrection of Hungary: A Parallel for Ireland"; and in a later edition of this book he reproduced his speech to the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn Féin, in which he urged that Ireland follow the models of Hungary and Finland in casting off oppressive foreign rule through sustained passive resistance.

Phare de l'Espiguette

The Phare de l'Espiguette (Espiguette Lighthouse) is a -high square tower. Built in 1869, the lighthouse is found on the Pointe de l'Espiguette, near to Le Grau-du-Roi on the Gulf of Lion in Languedoc-Roussillon, France.
Geography.
L'Espiguette appears on some of the oldest maps: on the Barentzoom map of 1593 it is called Lapiquete and was an island. The channels in the Rhone delta are constantly changing, it was in 1570 that the Grau de Roi opened up, and the subsequent channelling of this watercourse and the silting of the land alongside it led to the fishing village of Le Grau-du-Roi, and the silting made a land bridge through to L'Espiguette. To the south of L'Espiguette is the Mediterranean sea and to the north the Lagune de la Sicarex, which in itself is a protected breeding ground for endangered avian species. The point consists of 197 ha of sand dunes, and is a protected nature reserve. The beaches are popular with tourists, and host a large naturist beach.
History.
The square tower was built in 1869, from the mean high tide mark, the silting has continues and it is now situated in sand dunes more than from the water.

Richard Dominick

Richard Dominick is the former executive producer of NBC Universal Domestic Television Distribution's "The Jerry Springer Show" for almost 18 years. Dominick also served in the same capacity on "The Steve Wilkos Show" for its first season, as well as the truTV police series "Bait Car". He now produces (and created) another popular truTV series, "Hardcore Pawn".
Early life and career.
Dominick began his career as the artistic director of the New Jersey Public Theater. While there, he also created, wrote and performed in the Comedy Workshop, a group that innovated late night weekend comedy presentations.
Journalism.
His next career move was into journalism for the Weekly World News and The Sun where he reported on stories like "Toaster Possessed by the Devil' and "Howdy Doody Dummy comes alive and saves drowning Man." With his unique perspective, Dominick made seven appearances on Late Night with David Letterman to discuss his unusual assignments.
Transition to television.
Versed in writing, reporting and directing, Dominick soon made the transition into television with "The Wilton North Report", a short-lived late night comedy program for Fox. Later, he served as a producer for a 1990 syndicated revival of the TV series "House Party", which was hosted by future "Fox and Friends" co-host Steve Doocy. Dominick was also the sole writer for ESPN's Sports Emmy Awards, broadcast live in May 1991 and hosted by "Saturday Night Live" alumni, comedian Dennis Miller. 
Dominick also contributed comedy material as a freelance writer to Jay Leno. Other jobs have included writing for "The Jenny Jones Show" and serving as supervising producer of "Not Just News", a syndicated children's news program that aired during the 1991-92 season. Dominick has also made his mark as a freelance writer for such publications as National Lampoon, Cracked and Penthouse where, on assignment in 1990, he traveled the entire United States in search of Elvis.
"The Jerry Springer Show".
In 1991, Dominick joined "The Jerry Springer Show" and became the show's executive producer three years later, following the departure of original producer. Around this time, "Springer" was on the verge of being cancelled, prompting Dominick to take drastic action with regards to the show's format. He turned the world of TV talk shows upside down by taking the show out of the hands of experts and allowing ordinary people to come on stage and offer a slice of their lives - something they never had a chance to do before. He demanded his producers "make the show interesting with the sound off" and encouraged the show's controversial themes and topics, which led to the show's success and turned Jerry Springer himself into a pop culture icon. In 1998, Springer had made it to the top, knocking Oprah out of the top spot for 57 straight weeks. This led to Dominick being named one of 1998's "Marketing 100" by Advertising Age magazine. He was quoted in Newsweek as saying "If you want to save the whales, call Oprah. If you're dating a whale, call us." Dominick is also responsible for the sound effects that are often heard on the show.
Dominick was also one of the Executive Producers for Springer's 1998 film "Ringmaster".
"The Springer Hustle".
In 2006, Dominick teamed with VH1 to create a behind-the-scenes show, following the events of "The Jerry Springer Show". It debuted to good ratings, but was canceled after one season. Dominick dropped the show after finding it was too much on his heavy producing load.
"The Steve Wilkos Show".
In September 2007, former Springer bodyguard Steve Wilkos started his own show, taking on predators and bad parents. Richard Dominick served as the show's Executive Producer for the first season. He was relieved of his duties following the production of the first season.
Departure from Springer and Wilkos.
On September 3, 2008, Dominick announced he was leaving both "The Jerry Springer Show" as well as "The Steve Wilkos Show", to pursue other television offers as well as continue to grow his production company. 
In 2010, Dominick's production company and truTV launched the reality series "Hardcore Pawn". The show is recorded at American Jewelry And Loan
