Second round of voting in the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election

The second round of voting in the Zimbabwean presidential election of 2008 was held between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai after the first round failed to produce a 50% majority for either candidate. The election process was marred by violence against and intimidation of voters and party workers, which eventually led to the withdrawal of Tsvangirai from the poll. This left Mugabe as the winner of, effectively, a one-candidate election.
Start of the second round.
"The Herald" reported on 21 May that the ZANU-PF run-off campaign would be launched by Mugabe on 25 May at the party's national headquarters in Harare. According to Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, 2,000 people would be invited to attend this main launch, although other launches would be held in wards across the country. Speaking at a police recruit graduation ceremony on 21 May, Mugabe again blamed the MDC for the violence, saying that it was "on an evil crusade of dividing our people along political lines".
Tsvangirai announced on 22 May that he planned to return to Zimbabwe on 24 May. Tsvangirai accordingly arrived from South Africa at the airport in Harare on 24 May. Speaking at a press conference later that day, Tsvangirai said that he did not think a national unity government was possible. He also expressed certainty in victory and described meeting with people who had been injured in the violence. Meanwhile, a truck carrying 60,000 copies of "The Zimbabwean" newspaper into Zimbabwe from South Africa was hijacked and burned, destroying the newspapers on board.
At the ZANU-PF official campaign launch on 25 May, Mugabe stressed Tsvangirai's Western backing, stating that the UK and US were joyful over the result of the first round and that some Zimbabweans wanted to "sell country for candy, like children"; he said that Zimbabweans should instead "unite as a family against outsiders". In response to US Ambassador McGee's earlier call for Tsvangirai to return, he threatened to expel McGee from Zimbabwe, and he derided the MDC's claim of an assassination plot against Tsvangirai.
On 25 May, Tsvangirai attended the funeral of MDC activist Tonderai Ndira, who was, according to the MDC, killed on 14 May for political reasons after putting up posters. The MDC alleged that, out of 20 people who put up posters, three had been killed and five were missing, while four had been arrested and the remainder had gone into hiding. Meanwhile, in the "Sunday Mail", Chinamasa emphasised the critical nature of the second round for ZANU-PF, saying that "we are fighting with our backs to the wall". It was reported on the same day that the Pan African Parliament would send 30 observers, due to arrive on 13 June, with an advance team preceding them on 10 June.
In an article published in "The Herald" on 26 May, Mnangagwa expressed confidence that Mugabe would win, but said that Mugabe would "be the first one to go on national television to acknowledge the result to the people" if he lost. Angolan Foreign Minister Jo√£o Bernardo de Miranda said on the same day that SADC would increase the number of observers it was sending for the second round "so as to assure greater transparency and trust in the process". The MDC had requested more observers; on 26 May, Chamisa said that the MDC wanted
"full coverage of all the polling stations", and he said that it was particularly important that the observers have a strong presence in rural areas, as the MDC believed that problems were more likely to occur there. He also requested that SADC send a security monitoring team.
On 27 May, Tsvangirai and Chamisa said that more than 50 supporters had been killed in the violence up to that point. According to Chamisa, important members of the MDC were being abducted and their bodies were being found a few days later. He also said that the MDC was given no access to the state media and that it was "almost impossible" for the party to hold rallies, with permission for the MDC's previous two rallies being given only after it appealed to the High Court. However, he said that the difficulties the party was facing were merely "birth pangs" marking the transition to a new Zimbabwe, noting that the codename for the MDC's campaign was "Let's Finish It". On the same day, three people, including two South Africans, were arrested in Bulawayo after police found broadcasting and computer equipment belonging to Sky TV, a British television network, hidden in a factory. According to state radio, the equipment had been there since 23 March; it also said that the arrested individuals had attempted to bribe the police with 25,000 rand.
Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba expressed their concern regarding violence against worshippers to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 28 May. According to Williams and Makgoba, on 18 May security forces beat worshippers at churches in Harare and prevented them from attending church services.
Rather than endorse a candidate, Makoni called for the cancellation of the second round and the formation of a national unity government at a press conference on 29 May 2008, saying that this was urgently needed to prevent further violence. According to Makoni, there was evidence that some MDC supporters were engaging in retaliatory attacks against ZANU-PF. He said that a national unity government should exist on a transitional basis for two to five years, during which time healing and reconstruction would take place. He would not reveal whether he intended to ultimately support Tsvangirai, saying that if a second round could not be prevented, he and his Mavambo Kusile Dawn movement would "take a clear stand at the time".
Also on 29 May, Mugabe and his wife Grace visited the site of an alleged attack by MDC supporters at Shamva, in which a homestead was burned down. He said that they were deeply affected by seeing the destruction and warned the MDC that they should "stop immediately this barbaric campaign of burning and destroying people's homes". On this occasion, Grace told ZANU-PF supporters that, even if Tsvangirai won the second round, he would not be allowed to take office; she said that her husband would only leave office if he was succeeded by a member of ZANU-PF.
Meanwhile, it was reported by Michael Gerson, a columnist for "The Washington Post", a US newspaper, that Mbeki had sent a letter to Bush in April complaining about the US attitude towards Zimbabwe and its involvement in the situation.
On 30 May, Tsvangirai told the members of the MDC parliamentary caucus that, for the sake of healing, unity, and "moving the country forward", the MDC should try to co-operate with "those peaceful members of Zanu-PF whose eyes are open to the disastrous state of our nation", but he rejected any co-operation with ZANU-PF's "violent hawks". In this speech, which Tsvangirai described as a state of the nation address, he said that Zimbabwe was in "a state of despair" and was "an unmitigated embarrassment to the African continent" due to its economic situation; he also said that those engaging in political violence would receive no amnesty from his government. Tsvangirai said that the MDC's legislative program would be "based on the return of fundamental freedoms to the people of Zimbabwe". A new "people-driven constitution" would follow within 18 months, according to Tsvangirai, and a "truth and justice commission" would be established; the army would "defend our borders, not attack our people", while the prisons would "hold only criminals, not innocent people". He pledged that the party would introduce a new strategy combining "demand and supply-side measures" to bring inflation under control. Tsvangirai also promised the revival of agriculture, saying that the issue would be "completely depoliticized" and that there would be measures to "compensate or reintegrate" farmers who lost their land as part of land reform.
Chinamasa said in South Africa on 30 May that Tsvangirai was anti-Zimbabwean and that a victory for Tsvangirai would be disastrous and "destabilising". However, he expressed confidence in a victory for Mugabe, attributing Mugabe's failure to win in the first round to "complacency and overconfidence" among ZANU-PF supporters who neglected to vote. He said that the party was encouraging those supporters to vote in the second round. Regarding the violence, Chinamasa accused the US and British governments of encouraging it. Chinamasa also claimed that US Ambassador McGee was taking victims of the violence to the hospital and paying for their treatment, but that he was doing so only for MDC supporters; furthermore, he said that McGee was "moving round with journalists and photographers in places where there had been no violence", intending to "foment the violence in order to take pictures".
State media reported on 31 May that two ZANU-PF supporters had been killed by assailants believed to be MDC supporters. The MDC had planned to hold rallies in Hwange and Victoria Falls on the same day, but it was unable to do so because the police did not allow its supporters into the venues, according to Chamisa. He said that the police were obstructing the MDC on instructions from ZANU-PF. Eric Matinenga, the newly elected MDC MP for Buhera West, was arrested on 31 May for allegedly paying MDC supporters to attack war veterans; the MDC said that his arrest occurred when he went to visit MDC supporters who had already been arrested.
Continued campaigning, incidents.
Early on 1 June, Mutambara was arrested at his home in Harare. According to his lawyer, the arrest was due to an article he wrote in "The Standard" in April, which allegedly included "falsehoods" and "contempt of court"; in the article, Mutambara blamed Mugabe for the state of the economy and accused the security forces of committing abuses. The editor of "The Standard" was previously arrested in May due to this article. On 3 June, Mutambara was released on a bail of 20 million Zimbabwean dollars, with the next court date being set for 17 June. After the hearing on 3 June, he described his own suffering as minor compared to that of the people, saying that Mugabe's "human rights violations" would fail to accomplish their goals and vowing that "we will triumph over evil".
"The Herald" reported on 2 June that over 70 people had been arrested in connection with an attack on war veterans and ZANU-PF officials that occurred in Buhera district in the previous week; six people were injured in this violence. On 3 June, Tsvangirai declared in Bulawayo that he would continue campaigning even though Mugabe was "determined to turn the whole country into a war zone".
CARE International, a prominent international aid agency, said on 3 June that Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Nicholas Goche had ordered CARE to immediately suspend its activities at a meeting with the group on 30 May. This decision was based on allegations that members of CARE actively supported Tsvangirai, distributing literature in support of him and threatening to deny food to supporters of ZANU-PF; the suspension was to be followed by an investigation. CARE insisted that it had "a very strict policy against political activity", while the US government condemned the suspension. At the UN food summit in Rome, Mugabe said on 3 June that non-governmental organisations funded by the West "use food as a political weapon". Aside from CARE, two other NGOs, Save the Children and ASAP-Africa, said that they had been required to partially halt their activities.
The three arrested South Africans working for Sky News were sentenced to six months imprisonment on 3 June for illegal possession of broadcasting equipment. South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma described the first round as "free and fair" on 3 June and expressed the hope that the second round would be held under similar conditions. "The Herald" reported on 4 June that SADC had again increased the number of observers it planned to send for the second round to between 300 and 400.
Tsvangirai was detained near Lupane on 4 June, along with his security team and other top MDC officials, such as Thokozani Khupe and Lovemore Moyo. A lawyer for the MDC said that Tsvangirai was alleged to have addressed a rally near Lupane without permission. His vehicle was stopped by police at a roadblock and his motorcade was searched; after two hours, he was taken to a police station. The MDC described this as "part of a determined and well-orchestrated effort to derail our campaign programme", while the US government called the incident "deeply disturbing" and the German government demanded his release; Amnesty International said that it was "part of a sudden, sharp and dangerous crackdown on political opposition in the run-up to the elections". Tsvangirai was released later on the same day after nine hours. Bvudzijena, the police spokesman, rejected any suggestion that the police were trying to interfere in Tsvangirai's campaign; he explained the detention by saying that the police had wanted to determine whether a vehicle in Tsvangirai's motorcade had valid registration. According to Bvudzijena, the police had wanted to take only the driver of this vehicle to the police station to review the relevant documents, but that Tsvangirai and the rest of his entourage insisted on coming as well. Although the MDC said that Tsvangirai was released only after being charged with "attracting a large number of people", Bvudzijena said that he had not been charged. In a statement on 5 June, Tsvangirai vowed to persevere, and the MDC said that he was continuing his campaign.
According to rights activists, ZANU-PF supporters bombed an MDC office in Masvingo Province on 4 June; they said that at least two MDC officials were killed in the blast.
On 5 June 2008, diplomats and local embassy staff from the US and UK investigating political violence were detained at a roadblock in the town of Bindura, from Harare, by police and military officers. It was claimed by those in the convoy that they were forced off the road at gunpoint after refusing to go to a police station. They reported that tyres on the vehicles were slashed and a Zimbabwean driver was attacked. None of the diplomats was harmed. A police spokesman claimed the officials were being rescued from a dangerous mob. The US government said the attack was "absolutely outrageous" and, along with the UK government, asked for an explanation of the incident. The Zimbabwean ambassador in London was summoned for an explanation.
Subsequently, Deputy Information Minister Matonga gave the government's account of the incident: he said that the diplomats had addressed a gathering at the home of an MDC member and that police arrived at the scene due to commotion. According to Matonga, the diplomats then fled the home but were stopped by the police at a roadblock; after they "refused to disembark", police "deflated the tyres of one of the vehicles". Matonga also expressed the government's outrage at the way the British and Americans were behaving, accusing them of provocations intended to elicit a government response that would "play into their hands". US State Department spokesperson Sean McCormack said that the US would not forget the incident and that it intended to complain at the UN Security Council.
Also on 5 June, the United Nations announced that it was sending UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Haile Menkerios to Zimbabwe to discuss how the UN could assist in the electoral process. At the UN food summit in Rome a few days earlier, Ban Ki-moon had suggested to Mugabe the idea of sending Menkerios to Zimbabwe, and Mugabe agreed; Ban also stressed to Mugabe "the need to stop the violence and to deploy neutral international observers".
After meeting with Mbeki at the World Economic Forum Africa conference on 5 June, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said that Mbeki told him that both Mugabe and Tsvangirai recognised the need for a national unity government, but that they disagreed on the timing: Tsvangirai wanted it to be formed before the run-off was scheduled to be held, while Mugabe wanted it to be formed only after the run-off. Odinga also described Tsvangirai's detention as "detestable" and said that the crisis could only be resolved if South Africa took "a firm stand on the issue".
Also on 5 June, the government banned all international non-governmental organisations from working in Zimbabwe; Social Welfare Minister Goche informed the National Association of Non-Governmental Organisations that their activities were banned because they had been violating the terms of those of activities. The ban on NGO activities followed accusations that the agencies were supporting the MDC. They denied these accusations, and the administrator of one of them, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), criticised the suspension as "a direct threat to the lives and well-being of tens of thousands of innocent people in Zimbabwe".
Following the incident involving the diplomats, Biti said at the World Economic Forum conference on 6 June that "it is almost as if the regime is sending out a message to the region, to the international community that it doesn't care, that it has no respect for life, it has no respect for the rule of law." On the same day, the US embassy said that McGee would formally complain to the Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry. Meanwhile, Bvudzijena said that the diplomats had brought the problem on themselves by failing to identify themselves to the police.
The police refused to allow the MDC to hold rallies in Glen Norah, Kambuzuma, Mufakose, and Chitungwiza, on the grounds that the MDC had expressed fears that its leaders could be assassinated; according to the police, it was necessary to prevent the rallies so that the lives of MDC leaders would not be endangered by their appearances at the rallies. The MDC, rejecting this decision, took the matter to the High Court on 6 June, and Judge Alphas Chitakunye ruled on 7 June that the rallies should be allowed to take place without police interference.
Having been released on 5 June, MDC elected MP Eric Matinenga was arrested again early on 7 June and charged with incitement to public violence. Although the charge of incitement was dismissed and Matinenga's release was ordered, police continued to keep Matinenga in custody; his lawyers argued that Augustine Chihuri, the police commissioner, was guilty of contempt of court for failing to release him, and they sought to have Chihuri arrested for this. "The Herald" also reported on 7 June that 28 MDC supporters and eight ZANU-PF supporters had been arrested in Buhera following the discovery of a variety of weapons.
Chamisa alleged on 8 June that ZANU-PF supporters had prevented the MDC from holding one of the three rallies it planned to have in Harare that day, despite the court ruling allowing the rallies to proceed. Tsvangirai was campaigning in Bulawayo at this time. On the same day, a court ordered that Matinenga be released. Meanwhile, according to "The Herald", MDC supporters killed a war veteran and wounded four other ZANU-PF supporters in an attack in Bikita district.
On 9 June, Deputy Attorney-General Johannes Tomana said in "The Herald" that anyone arrested for involvement in the violence would not be granted bail. Chamisa was critical of this, saying that the purpose of it was to keep MDC supporters in jail and predicting that it would not be applied to ZANU-PF supporters.
The South African newspaper "Business Day" reported on 10 June that representatives of ZANU-PF and the MDC (Chinamasa and Goche for ZANU-PF, Biti and Elton Mangoma for the MDC) had participated in a late May meeting in South Africa, chaired by South African Minister of Local Government Sydney Mufamadi, at which options for resolving the situation were discussed. Among the possibilities reportedly discussed was a national unity government in which Mugabe would remain President while Tsvangirai would take up a newly created post of Prime Minister, similar to the arrangement devised to resolve the Kenyan crisis earlier in 2008. Chamisa denied the existence of this meeting in South Africa. In Johannesburg, Makoni reiterated his opposition to holding the run-off and said that negotiations between the two parties on the formation of a unity government were underway. According to Makoni, both Mugabe and Tsvangirai had agreed to a unity government, but that an agreement had not been reached on who would be the "top person" under such an arrangement.
Also on 10 June, according to the MDC, ZANU-PF supporters threw rocks at the home of elected MDC Senator Empire Makamure and burned his car, in addition to setting ablaze two lorries belonging to a businessman thought to support the MDC. Tsvangirai said on the same day that there had been a ""de facto" coup d'√©tat" and that Zimbabwe was "effectively now run by a military junta", but he vowed to continue his campaign. He said that Mugabe was ultimately to blame for what he described as "state-sponsored violence". According to Tsvangirai, 66 MDC supporters had been killed up to that point, in addition to 200 missing and 3,000 hospitalized. Furthermore, he said that if Mugabe was declared the winner of the election, that would only confirm "the illegitimacy of this regime". Tsvangirai was dismissive regarding speculation about a national unity government.
A new campaign bus for the MDC was debuted in Harare on 11 June. According to Chamisa, this 80-seat bus‚Äîpainted with the MDC's colours and featuring Tsvangirai's image‚Äîwas "a new concept to ensure we remain visible under circumstances of violence". Tsvangirai said that the party would go to "every town, village, to meet the people of Zimbabwe".
In Masvingo, ZANU-PF officials said on 11 June that they were sending war veterans to campaign for Mugabe and work against the MDC in the province. On the same day, the government announced that it was lowering taxes for low-wage workers. Meanwhile, the MDC claimed that the government was making people remove satellite dishes so that they would lack access to foreign television, but Minister of Information Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said that in fact only one war veteran had tried to make people take down the dishes and that the government had stopped him.
Biti returned to Zimbabwe on 12 June and was immediately arrested at the airport in Harare. Before his departure from Johannesburg, Biti said that he had already learned that he would be arrested, but maintained that his only crime was "fighting for democracy". Furthermore, he said that it was necessary for him to return to participate in the MDC's struggle, despite describing it as "a stupid decision" for him to do so. Biti also said on this occasion that talks on a national unity government had collapsed because the MDC insisted on having Tsvangirai as President and excluding Mugabe from the arrangement, while ZANU-PF insisted on Mugabe remaining President. He also expressed disappointment with regional efforts to resolve the situation and doubted that the UN would be able to resolve it, saying that Zimbabweans were "on their own ‚Äì and the sooner we realise it, the better".
Following Biti's arrest, Bvudzijena, the police spokesman, said that he would be charged with treason, based on an MDC document about changing the government. Bvudzijena said that Biti would additionally be charged with making false statements "prejudicial to the state" due to his announcement of election results prior to their release by the Electoral Commission. US Ambassador McGee expressed deep concern on behalf of the US government, saying that the document in question was an unobjectionable statement of the MDC's plans and goals; according to McGee, another, more extreme version of the document existed, but it was forged. He called on SADC to send "three or four times" as many observers as the 400 it planned to send. McGee also alleged that 20 tons of US food aid had been confiscated and distributed to ZANU-PF supporters, contrary to its intended use, in the previous week. McGee said that he had complained about this misappropriation of food aid but that he had received no response: "The bottom line is, they don't care".
While campaigning on 12 June, Tsvangirai was detained twice; after being first detained in Kwekwe for about two hours, he was detained in Gweru, along with about 20 other MDC officials, for about four hours before being released.
At a ZANU-PF rally on 12 June, Mugabe said that war veterans had asked him after the first round if they could "take up arms". According to Mugabe, he replied that he did not want war, but he also vowed that the MDC would never take power, saying that the MDC would forfeit the gains of the liberation struggle and give Zimbabwe "back to our former oppressors, the whites".
On 13 June, Biti's lawyers said that they had not been allowed to meet with him, and they filed an urgent application with the High Court on the same day. The MDC said that it was "deeply worried" about Biti's welfare and that it had sent a team to police stations across Harare, hoping to determine where he was being held. Meanwhile, two MDC campaign buses were impounded by the police. The South African Litigation Centre said on the same day that a number of domestic non-governmental organisations in Zimbabwe had been ordered to cease operations by the police, while South African Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad gave an assurance that his country would work to prevent a civil war from developing in Zimbabwe.
In an open letter on 13 June 39 prominent figures in Africa‚Äîincluding Kofi Annan, former heads of state, and civic leaders‚Äîcalled for a free and fair election, stressing that this was "crucial for the interests of both Zimbabwe and Africa".
Mugabe said at a rally on 14 June that he was willing to step aside at some point in favour of someone else from ZANU-PF, although he did not name the successor he envisioned or the time he planned for this to happen. He remarked, however, that he would "not grow old" "as long as the British still want to come here" and "until we know we no longer have sellouts among us". At a rally on 15 June, Mugabe said that the aid agencies had been suspended for exploiting the need for food aid by encouraging people who received the aid to vote for the MDC. Speaking at Silobela in Midlands Province, he said that "a mere X" (a vote) could not overturn the liberation struggle. In "The Herald" on 17 June, he again accused the MDC of orchestrating the violence and said that MDC leaders would soon be held responsible for violence committed by their supporters under a law regarding "vicarious responsibility and liability". He also said that hunger and the absence of commodities were not problems worth "selling the country" over.
In the March election, the MDC won 45 of the 46 local council seats in Harare, and Emmanuel Chiroto of the MDC was elected as Mayor of Harare by the councillors on 15 June. Ignatius Chombo, the Minister of Local Government, has not sworn in the new local administrations, and because the elected Harare councillors were not allowed to meet at Harare's Town House, they met elsewhere to elect Chiroto. On the night of 16 June, Chiroto's house in the suburb of Hatcliffe was attacked and destroyed by ZANU-PF supporters; Chiroto believed that petrol bombs were used. Chiroto's wife and son were taken away by the attackers, although his son was delivered to a police station on 16 June. His wife was subsequently found dead, and Chiroto went into hiding.
On 16 June, UN diplomat Menkerios arrived in Harare; he met with Mugabe on 17 June "to discuss the technical requirements for holding the election, to see what the UN can do to help build capacity for a free and fair election". On the same day, the Nelson Mandela Foundation announced that it had signed the open letter in support of a free and fair election, while Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga, speaking in Washington, DC, described Zimbabwe as "an eyesore on the African continent" and said that he was saddened by the silence of many African leaders regarding the situation. He also criticised the second round as a "complete sham". UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour said on 18 June that a member of her staff, who had arrived in Zimbabwe on 15 June, had been expelled from the country on 17 June. Also on 18 June, it was reported that Mbeki was visiting Zimbabwe, cancelling a trip to Sudan to do so. On that day, he and Mugabe met in Bulawayo. It was reported that they discussed Biti's arrest and the possibility of Mugabe meeting with Tsvangirai, but this was not confirmed. Mbeki met with Tsvangirai as well on 18 June. Mbeki reportedly wanted the second round to be cancelled in favour of a national unity government, believing that the second round would not resolve the situation. This attempt was reportedly unsuccessful, however.
Ban Ki-moon said on 18 June that he was alarmed by conditions in the period leading up to the election and that, if the situation did not improve, "the legitimacy of the election outcomes would be in question". Meanwhile, Gordon Brown described the Zimbabwean government as a "criminal cabal" and denied the possibility of a free and fair election under the existing circumstances, saying that international observers needed to be freely admitted. Rwandan President Paul Kagame was also critical, condemning the suggestions from ZANU-PF that it might not relinquish power if defeated, while Jacob Zuma also doubted that the election would be free and fair.
Also on 18 June, another elected MDC MP, Shuwa Mudiwa, was arrested in Harare for allegedly kidnapping a girl, while six other elected MDC MPs were declared to be wanted for allegedly engaging in violence. 11 MDC activists, accused of taking down posters of Mugabe and defacing them, were also arrested in Chinhoyi on the same day.
Biti was charged on 19 June. He faced four charges: "treason, communicating falsehoods prejudicial to the State, insulting President Mugabe and causing disaffection among the defence forces".. Prosecutors argued against granting bail to Biti, noting that the charges against him were so serious that he could be executed. The defence submitted an application to have the charges thrown out, but on 20 June magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe dismissed this application, saying that he believed there was "reasonable suspicion that the accused committed the said offence". Biti's next court appearance was set for 7 July, and Guvamombe ordered that he remain in custody until then.
With state media refusing to print or broadcast the MDC's campaign material, Chamisa said on 19 June that the party had applied to the High Court seeking an order to ensure that the MDC could have its campaign material in state media. The party also challenged the police ban on MDC rallies, as well as the practice of having members of the security forces vote early by postal ballot while their superior officers were present. Zimbabwe Broadcasting Holdings (ZBH) said that it did not broadcast the MDC's advertisements because it objected to the assertions of some of these advertisements that Tsvangirai had already won the election in the first round. It also objected to what it described as "hate language" used in some of the advertisements, while noting that other advertisements which did not include these things were acceptable. Chamisa also said that four MDC activists, allegedly abducted by ZANU-PF supporters on 17 June, had been found dead in Chitungwiza, near Harare; he placed the party's death toll up to that point at "about 70".
Also on 19 June, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe, speaking for SADC, said that there was "every sign that these elections will never be free nor fair". According to Membe, this evaluation was based on what 211 observers already present in Zimbabwe had seen; he said that the observers witnessed two people being shot and killed on 17 June.
Meanwhile, Mugabe, campaigning in Matabeleland North, said in reference to land reform that he would be ready to retire when he believed that "this legacy is truly in your hands people are empowered"; he said that he treasured all Zimbabwean soil and could not allow it to be given back to the British. At a rally in Bulawayo on 20 June, Mugabe said that he was appointed by God and that he could only be removed from office by God. He also said that the MDC claimed its supporters were being victimised only so that it could use this as a basis for allegations that the election was not free and fair.
Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri said on 20 June that the MDC was primarily responsible for the violence, alleging that the party was using its Democratic Resistance Committees to intimidate voters in an effort "to influence the outcome of the elections". Chihuri stressed that the police would not tolerate any violence and said that they were enforcing the law fairly and without regard for political affiliation, despite the MDC's claims to the contrary. According to Chihuri, 390 MDC supporters had been arrested for political violence since the first round, along with 156 ZANU-PF supporters. On the same day, Chamisa suggested that the MDC might withdraw from the election, saying that there was "a huge avalanche of calls and pressure from supporters across the country, especially in the rural areas", expressing opposition to taking part in the run-off under the circumstances. Meanwhile, in a draft statement on 20 June, the EU said that it was prepared "to take additional measures against those responsible for violence", which was viewed as a threat to impose stronger sanctions on Zimbabwe.
Tsvangirai's withdrawal.
After a planned MDC rally in Harare on 22 June was prevented by ZANU-PF supporters, Tsvangirai announced at a press conference on the same day that he was withdrawing from the election due to the violence. He said that his supporters faced being killed if they voted for him and that under such circumstances he could not ask them to do so. According to Tsvangirai, a free and fair election was impossible for eight basic reasons: "state-sponsored violence" ("The police have been reduced to bystanders while Zanu PF militia commit crimes against humanity varying from rape, torture, murder, arson, abductions and other atrocities."); interference with the MDC's campaign, including its inability to hold rallies; the arrests of many members of the MDC, including important figures, thereby disrupting the party's organizational ability to campaign; Electoral Commission "partisanship" (although he said that the Electoral Commission was not really in control); media censorship, harassment of journalists, and the exclusion of foreign journalists; Mugabe's attitude and his suggestions that he would not accept defeat; and the existence of "an elaborate and decisive plan by Zanu PF to rig the elections", which included extensive intimidation, obstruction of MDC election agents, and ballot stuffing in the Mashonaland provinces. Tsvangirai said that the MDC would ultimately prevail and that its victory "can only be delayed".
Despite Tsvangirai's withdrawal, Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said that the second round would nevertheless be held: "The constitution does not say that if somebody drops out or decides to chicken out the runoff will not be held". Chinamasa dismissed the MDC's decision as "threats", noting that it had not been formalised; he also said that it was too late to withdraw, and that any withdrawal should have occurred at least 21 days before the first round was held. Furthermore, he said that ZANU-PF would continue its campaign and "romp to victory". According to Chinamasa, Tsvangirai had only been prepared for a "sprint", not a "marathon", and by leaving the country for a substantial period‚Äî"globe-trotting and gallivanting in Europe"‚Äîhe had enabled ZANU-PF to take the advantage in campaigning. Chinamasa stated that Tsvangirai realised, after returning to Zimbabwe, that he had lost the advantage, and preferred withdrawal to suffering defeat. Additionally, Chinamasa claimed that Tsvangirai had promised 1,000 United States dollars to each of his polling agents after the first round, but had failed to pay this amount to many of them, leading them to abandon him; he also alleged that MDC supporters were wearing ZANU-PF symbols while attacking people.
According to Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen, Tsvangirai took refuge at the embassy of The Netherlands in Harare late on 22 June. The police again raided Harvest House, the MDC headquarters in Harare, on 23 June; according to MDC spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka, many of those who were in Harvest House had fled the building during the raid, but he said that police took away about 40 people. Bvudzijena, the police spokesman, said that the police had taken 39 people from the building for health reasons.
Mugabe said on 24 June that ZANU-PF was "open to discussion", but that the second round must be held first. He rejected any attempts at foreign interference or judgements from those with "ulterior motives", and he asserted that the election was a sovereign matter, with the decision belonging to the people alone. He noted that some other African elections had seen hundreds of deaths, but these elections had not received as much criticism from the West; Mugabe attributed this disparity to the West's alleged control of the MDC. He also derided Tsvangirai for taking refuge in the Dutch Embassy, saying that no one wanted to attack him and that he went to the Embassy due to anxiety about losing the election.
The MDC formally submitted Tsvangirai's withdrawal to the Electoral Commission on 24 June, but the Electoral Commission did not accept the withdrawal because it considered the withdrawal to have been filed too late. Also on 24 June, according to the MDC, its Senator-elect for Chimanimani, Mayemureyi Munhuri, was taken from her home at gunpoint along with her husband; the party said that about 30 other MDC activists were also abducted on that day. MDC MP-elect Pishai Muchauraya alleged that such abductions were becoming more common following Tsvangirai's withdrawal, and he accused the government of trying to prevent the withdrawal from becoming more widely known so that the second round would appear more legitimate.
Tsvangirai said in an interview with the British newspaper "The Times" on 26 June that if Mugabe went ahead with the election, there would be no further possibility of negotiations and he would "not speak to an illegitimate president". He also indicated that he did not anticipate leaving the Dutch Embassy in the near future, saying that he was "the prime target" and would not "take chances" regarding his safety; he claimed that the rule of law did not exist in Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai stressed in another statement that he did not favour military intervention.
Biti was released on bail on 26 June.
International reaction.
Following Tsvangarai's withdrawal from the election, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on 23 June that the election should be postponed as Tsvangarai's decision to withdraw was understandable because of the scale of violence against his supporters. He said that the "people of Zimbabwe have the right to choose their own leader." He has also talked to other African leaders (especially South Africa) on this issue and said that the elections should take place only when the conditions are conducive to a free and fair vote, adding that the situation in Zimbabwe at the moment was the "single greatest challenge to regional stability."
African Union Chairman of the Commission Jean Ping described the events as "a matter of grave concern". On 25 June, SADC called for the election to be delayed and for "meaningful talks" to take place between ZANU-PF and the MDC, stating that "the people of Zimbabwe can solve their own problems".
Representatives of South Africa's ruling African National Congress party rejected the idea of foreign intervention into Zimbabwean affairs, especially by the former colonial powers.
Zimbabwean Government reaction.
Zimbabwean officials hailed the decision by the United Nations Security Council to block efforts by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to halt the run-off. The key role was played by South Africa's Ambassador to the UN, Dumisani Khumalo.
Second round voting and aftermath.
The second round was held as planned on 27 June, and Tsvangirai's name remained on the ballot. Voting took place over the course of 12 hours, ending at 7¬†pm. Mugabe and his wife Grace voted in Highfield Township, near Harare, and he said that he was "optimistic upbeat". Tsvangirai denounced the vote, describing it as "an exercise in mass intimidation", and called on other countries to not recognise the results, saying that to do so would mean "denying the will of the Zimbabwean people and standing in the way of a transition that will deliver peace and prosperity".
According to official media, turnout was high and the MDC's call for a boycott was not followed. "The Herald" described turnout as "massive". There were reports that some people were pressured or forced to vote, as well as reports that voter secrecy was not respected in some places.
The spokesman of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) observer mission, Khalid A. Dahab, said that there was "a lot of tension" and the situation was "not normal". The PAP observer mission also said that there were a substantial number of spoiled ballots and that turnout was "very, very low". The BBC reported that ZANU-PF militias went to homes in townships near Harare to pressure people into voting. According to the Zimbabwe Election Support Network, people were forced to vote in rural areas.
Although results were expected on 28 June, the Electoral Commission announced on that day that they would be delayed so that the collation of votes from some rural areas could be completed. Also on 28 June, Mugabe declared that trends from the results showed him winning overwhelmingly; he said that he had won in all 26 of the constituencies in Harare, despite the MDC's victory there in the first round. Chamisa said on the same day that the election was "an unbelievable sham" and "a farce", and he criticised Mbeki for "acting as a shield for a rogue regime".
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement on 29 June that in two Harare neighbourhoods ZANU-PF supporters inflicted beatings on people who did not vote; non-voters were reportedly identified either by the absence of indelible ink on their fingers or by their absence from a list of those who had voted. HRW is part of a network of organisations associated with George Soros, which also includes the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa and Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, parent organisation of the MDC.
The Electoral Commission announced results on 29 June, showing Mugabe with 2,150,269 votes against 233,000 for Tsvangirai, or 85.51% of the vote; turnout was placed at 42.37%, and 131,481 ballots were spoiled. Mugabe was promptly sworn in for another term as President by Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku at State House about an hour after the announcement of results.
Speaking immediately after being sworn in, Mugabe called for "serious dialogue" between political parties to promote greater "unity and cooperation". He also praised Mbeki's role in the situation, saying that the country was "indebted to his untiring efforts to promote harmony and peace", and he thanked "many African states, members of the Non-Aligned Movement, allies and friends in the United Nations Security Council and other progressive movements ... for their unwavering solidarity with us as we continue to face the vicious onslaught by Britain and its allies". Mugabe said that he was "honoured and humbled" by his re-election and pledged that his government would concentrate on empowering the people in all sectors of the economy as part of efforts to "improve the economy and living standards." Furthermore, he expressed satisfaction that, in his view, the electoral process had met "all constitutional requirements". He then left Zimbabwe later on the same day to attend an AU summit in Egypt.
Tsvangirai was invited to Mugabe's swearing in ceremony, but he refused to attend. According to a presidential spokesman, George Charamba, this invitation was extended to Tsvangirai "in the spirit of the president's wish to reach out" and that it was "a major step towards political engagement". The spokesman of the MDC-Mutambara faction, Gabriel Chaibva, attended the ceremony, saying that he expected to be criticised for his presence but that he felt it was necessary to look forward and embrace dialogue.
Biti rejected the possibility of power-sharing on 1 July, saying that by holding the election ZANU-PF had "totally and completely exterminated any prospect of a negotiated settlement". The government also dismissed the possibility on the same day, saying that Zimbabwe could solve its political issues in its own way, without copying the Kenyan power-sharing model.
After the AU called for dialogue between ZANU-PF and the MDC, Mbeki said on 2 July that Mugabe was agreeable to this and expressed his commitment to dialogue. Information Minister Ndlovu also expressed the government's commitment to dialogue and said that the AU's resolution was in line with Mugabe's statements at his inauguration. Tsvangirai, however, rejected dialogue, saying that violence and "persecution" must stop first. He also said that dialogue should lead to the establishment of a transitional government, the creation of a new constitution, and then a new election, rather than merely a national unity government.
On 2 July, CNN reported that 220 Zimbabweans fled to the US Embassy in Harare, seeking refuge from election-related violence. Many of the refugees are supporters of MDC.
Although the AU summit called for dialogue and a national unity government, it declined to adopt the kind of tough measures against Zimbabwe that were favoured by Western countries. Mugabe returned to Zimbabwe on 4 July and was welcomed by a celebratory crowd of about 4,000 at the airport in Harare. Speaking at the airport, he said that dialogue would only be possible if the opposition acknowledged his victory, declaring that the votes of his supporters would "never be thrown away". Chamisa said on the same day that this condition was unacceptable.
Negotiations between the MDC and ZANU-PF regarding the formation of a national unity government began later in July. Human Rights Watch released a report on 12 August 2008 in which it said that at least 163 people had been killed by ZANU-PF supporters throughout the election period and up to the time of the report; 32 of these deaths, according to the report, occurred after the second round, and two of them had occurred after the start of negotiations. The report also said that 5,000 people had been beaten and tortured, and it described criminal charges against 12 elected MDC members of parliament as "politically motivated".
In early August, the Supreme Court ruled that the Electoral Commission's refusal to accept the nomination papers of Zimbabwe People's Party leader Justine Chiota was unlawful. Chiota followed this up by applying to the Supreme Court for the election to be nullified.
Talks between parties.
Preliminary talks to set up conditions for official negotiations began between leading negotiators from both parties on 10 July, and on 22 July, the three party leaders met for the first time in Harare to express their support for a negotiated settlement of disputes arising out of the presidential and parliamentary elections. Negotiations between the parties officially began on 25 July and are currently proceeding with very few details released from the negotiation teams in Pretoria, as coverage by the media is barred from the premises where the negotiations are taking place. The talks were mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki.
A final deal was reached on 11 September 2008, possibly with Tsvangirai chairing the council of ministers and Mugabe chairing a new national security council.

Klaatu (comics)

Klaatu is a fictional Marvel Comics alien. He first appeared in "The Incredible Hulk" vol. 2 #136 (Feb 1971). His character history was a thinly veiled pastiche of Moby Dick.Moby Dick is considered to be a symbol of a number of things, among them God, nature, fate, the ocean, and the very universe itself.It can be assumed,that "Klaatu"-a name barrowed from the Christ like alien of The Day the Earth Stood Still,is also a similar symbol,but watered down for a comic book audience. Klaatu's origin story is reprinted in "The Essential Incredible Hulk Volume 3".
Fictional character biography.
Klaatu was once attacked by the Andromeda Starship, in a manner reminiscent of terrestrial whaling. Klaatu destroyed the craft carrying a young "oarsman" who was badly burned as a result, requiring nearly half his body to be reconstructed with cybernetics. This young man grew up to become the obsessed Captain Cybor, who would stalk Klaatu for the rest of his life as captain of the Andromeda Starship.
On Earth, in New York City during a power shortage, the Hulk jumped to the top of the Empire State Building, as he sensed a disturbance there. At the top of the building the Hulk saw the Andromeda Starship and a harpoon-wielding Xeron the Star-Slayer, while an immaterial Klaatu emerged from the building itself, causing a complete blackout in the city. A confused Hulk attacked Klaatu, to no effect, and the creature disappeared, telling the Hulk it was going to consume all the electricity of the city. Xeron, irritated at the Hulk for causing him to lose his quarry, knocked him unconscious with an energy harpoon. Upon waking, the Hulk was attacked by the ship's first mate, the Abomination.
The Andromeda Starship later confronted Klaatu again, and Xeron and Cybor were able to mortally wound the creature before their own ship was severely damaged in the process. While Xeron tried to save the ship and its crew, Cybor fell onto the creature's back as it drifted into space and apparently into the sun, presumably to both their deaths, while the Andromeda Starship appeared stranded in space.
Years later it is revealed that Klaatu was not killed, but rejuvenated by the sun's energies, and had saved Xeron and Cybor and the Andromeda Starship. The Hulk encountered him again in the Crossroads, an interdimensional nexus in which the Hulk was then trapped. The Hulk, in a more feral state of mind, attacked Klaatu, again to no effect. Klaatu departs before the arrival of the Andromeda Starship, which is still pursuing Captain Cybor's vendetta, and which captures the Hulk, and then follows Klaatu into "Ocean World".
The Andromeda Starship confronts Klaatu again, but must break off the attack when the Hulk wakes up and starts tearing the ship apart. The starship again finds Klaatu, and again apparently mortally wounds it with several energy harpoons. Angered, the creature destroys the ship, killing its entire crew. The Hulk takes pity on Klaatu, however, and removes the energy harpoons from its body, presumably saving its life.
Powers and abilities.
Klaatu is a member of the extraterrestrial race called the Herm, and as such it is immensely powerful, and has been described as power incarnate. It can drain power off of large areas, such as New York, and add to its own power. It can disperse its atoms to feed on a larger area and then bring them back together. It is huge, about as tall as a skyscraper, and is unable to be harmed by physical force, and the Hulk's mightiest blows did absolutely nothing. It is made up of energies and needs to consume them to survive. It can draw power from any electromagnetic energy source. It could fly through space unaided. It is however, susceptible to certain technology, which can injure, and even destroy it, such as special energy harpoons wielded by Xeron the Star-Slayer, and special energy blasts from the Andromeda Starship1. It also cannot live for too long in an environment that is rich with oxygen.

The Clarendonians

The Clarendonians are a ska and rocksteady vocal group from Jamaica, active initially from the mid to late 1960s. They reformed in the 1990s and continue to perform live.
History.
The Clarendonians were originally Fitzroy "Ernest" Wilson and Peter Austin (who would also record as part of The Soul Lads), both from Hayes in Clarendon Parish, the duo coming together in 1963. The duo won several talent contests and recorded their debut single, "A Day Will Come" at Federal Records with producer Leslie Kong. They came to the attention of Studio One boss and producer Clement Dodd, while they were still in their early teens. Dodd took the duo into the studio, and recorded a series of singles (including "Rudie Gone a Jail", "Sho Be Do Be", "Rudie Bam Bam", "You Can't Be Happy", and "Darling Forever" - all chart-toppers in Jamaica, and "You Can't Keep a Good Man Down") that helped to define the 'rude boy' era of ska, alongside the other (initially less successful) young vocal group that Dodd was working with, The Wailers. Dodd expanded the group to a trio with the addition of a seven year old Freddie McGregor (who had to stand on a crate to reach the microphone), although they would often still record as a duo, with McGregor and Wilson recording as Freddie & Fitzie, and McGregor and Austin recording as Freddie & Peter.
Austin became disaffected with Dodd in the late 1960s and went on to record as a solo artist for producer Ken Lack, also recording a brace of tunes for producer Phil Pratt, but failed to match the success of his colleagues. He went on to work as an aviation supervisor at Norman Manley International Airport.
Ernest Wilson was the first member to establish himself as a solo artist, with singles such as "Storybook Children" and "If I Were a Carpenter", and briefly recorded under the name 'King Shark', and with The Techniques. He continued to be sporadically successful through to the 1990s.
McGregor took some time to establish himself as a solo artist, working at Studio One as a session drummer and backing singer, but found success with "Bobby Bobylon", and since the late 1970s has been one of the biggest names in reggae.
Wilson and Austin reformed The Clarendonians in the 1990s and in 2013 performed to celebrate the group's fiftieth anniversary.

The Roscoe Diner, located in the hamlet of Roscoe in Sullivan County, New York is a frequent stopping point for those traveling Route 17 between New York City and Western New York. It was built in 1964 and is considered to be one of the busiest and most well known restaurants along Route 17. Although Roscoe is a small town with a population of less than 600 at the time of the 2000 census, the diner served anywhere between several hundred and a thousand meals each day at its peak although numbers have declined in recent years due to a decline in trout fishing, the region's main draw. 2006 floods in the region came close but did not damage the diner. One of the diner's specialties is its famous French Toast, featuring generous slabs of bread that are 1.5" thick.
Notoriety.
During the 2010 NFL Preseason, the Roscoe Diner was the site of several negotiation meetings between the management of the New York Jets and the representatives of Darrelle Revis during Revis' holdout from the club due to a contract dispute. The prologue and outcome of the meetings were chronicled on the HBO documentary series Hard Knocks: Training Camp With The New York Jets. Revis ended his holdout and signed with the Jets on September 6, 2010.

Wairarapa North

Wairarapa North is a former New Zealand parliamentary electorate, from 1881 to 1887.
Population centres.
The previous electoral redistribution was undertaken in 1875 for the 1875‚Äì76 election. In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875‚Äì76 election). The number of MƒÅori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 35 new electorates being formed, including Wairarapa North, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries.
Wairarapa North was centred on the largest Wairarapa town of Masterton, with its southern boundary south of Masterton.
History.
The Wairarapa North electorate in the Wairarapa district of New Zealand and the adjacent Wairarapa South electorate were formed for the by splitting the old electorate. These electorates existed for two elections from 1881 to 1887, when Wairarapa North was renamed Masterton, and Wairarapa South became the new Wairarapa electorate.
Between 1871 and 1881, the previous Wairarapa electorate had been a two-member electorate. In the 1871 election, one of the incumbents, Henry Bunny, who had represented Wairarapa since a by-election in , was beaten by Walter Clarke Buchanan in the Wairarapa South electorate. The other incumbent, George Beetham, was challenged by Alfred Renall in the Wairarapa North electorate. Beetham and Renall received 670 and 351 votes, respectively, and Beetham was thus declared elected.
In the , the incumbent Buchanan was challenged by William Wilson McCardle. Beetham and McCardle received 542 and 517 votes, respectively.
In 1887, when Wairarapa North was abolished, Beetham became the MP for the new electorate.
Election results.
Wairarapa North was represented by one MP for all six years.

<doc id="18363669" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18363669" title="Continuous duty overnight">
Continuous duty overnight

Continuous duty overnights (CDOs) are also referred to as "stand-ups", "naps", or "high-speeds" and is a scheduling practice used in regional airline operations to circumvent, or "outsmart" government flight crew minimum rest requirements. A few major airlines (such as US Airways) also use them.
A crew working a CDO will generally operate the last flight out at night, have on duty time on the ground (anywhere from 0‚Äì8 hours) at the destination and then operate the first flight back in the morning. Since the break between flights is not sufficient to qualify as a free from duty rest period, the crewmembers remain continuously on duty, even though they may have been provided with a hotel room for rest. Crew members would normally require 9 hours of consecutive rest for a scheduled flight time of less than 8 hours. Since crews can legally be kept on duty up to 16 hours the airlines use this to circumvent the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) minimum crew rest requirements by keeping the crew on duty for the entire night. 
Another factor is delays. Because of this set up; delays taken throughout the day that result in a delay the last flight (first flight of a CDO) do not impact the first flight the next day. It would simply reduced the amount of time the crew are on the ground. 
The continuous duty overnight schedule could be flown 3‚Äì5 times consecutively (i.e., back-to-back).
Examples of a CDO.
Flight crew is to report to the airport at 2040 (8:40¬†pm), which means the crew will have to arrive earlier to park, clear airport security, and get to their operations office to check in. Then they would fly from 2147 to 0037 (2-hour, 50-minute flight). Once at their destination they have 6 hours 13 minutes on the ground. In that time they have to ride to and check in (about 20 minutes) at the hotel. They would get to their hotel room about 0100 and have to be awake at 0530 (30 minutes to get ready) for the 0600 shuttle to the airport. Leaving the crew about 4 hours and 30 minutes of ‚Äúrest‚Äù. A 0650 departure and 2-hour, 18-minute return trip gets them at the gate at 0908. After unloading they would be released (still at the aircraft) at 0923. That is a total of 12 hours and 43 minutes on duty and 5 hours and 8 minutes of flying.
Flight crew would report at 2100, fly from 2200 to 2300, then "stand-up" on duty overnight from 2315 to 0515, then fly 0600 to 0700, followed by a rest period from 0700 to 1700. The flight crew would then report at 1700, fly 1800 to 1900, then "stand-up" on duty 1915 to 0115, and then fly 0200 to 0300. This example involves only one-hour flight examples, a clear underestimation of actual flight times and number of segments that might typically be flown.
Other issues.
Some crews are not provided a hotel by their airline or want to make the most of their time on the ground and resort to sleeping in the aircraft. Pilots take off their ties and hang up their shirts. "You don't want to look unprofessional after sleeping in an aircraft," another pilot said. "There are some people that bring sleeping bags and pillows and their own blankets so they don't have to use the airline blankets." In airline slang, this is called 'a camp out.'

Daniel Clement Colesworthy

Daniel Clement Colesworthy (14 July 1810 ‚Äì 1 April 1893) was an American printer, bookseller, and poet. He was born in Portland, Maine in 1810, the son of Daniel P. and Anna Collins Colesworthy. He became a printer, having served an apprenticeship in the office of Arthur Shirley, beginning at the age of fourteen years. Early in his life, he became the editor and publisher of a young people's paper first known as "The Sabbath School Instructor", and afterwards "Moral Reformer", and "Journal of Reform", which did not last many years.
In June, 1840, he commenced the publication of a small semi-monthly paper call "The Youth's Monitor", which he continued for about two years. In 1841 he printed the first number of a weekly literary paper, the "Portland Tribune", which he continued for four years and ten weeks, and in June, 1845, sold his interest in the paper to John Edwards, who was publisher of the "Portland Bulletin". The two papers, becoming united, were called the "Tribune and Bulletin".
Colesworthy kept a book store on Exchange Street, and for a while in the basement of the old Mariners' church Building, on the corner of Fore and Moulton Streets. 
He afterwards, and before 1851, moved to Boston and opened a bookstore on Cornhill. He was also proprietor of another store in the immediate vicinity, having his home in Chelsea. 
He was a voluminous writer, both in prose and verse, seeking to instruct as well as amuse his readers. Among his publications are several volumes of poetry, including the following in order of publication: "The Opening Buds," "A Group of Children," "The Year," and "School is Out." The latter of these was published in 1876, with copious notes, that were valuable for their biographical and historical data. The following notable quotation is from this work.
His son, William Gibson Colesworthy (1851‚Äì1907), attended Harvard and Boston University, entered his father's business in 1877 and carried on his father's bookstore at 66 Cornhill until his own death in 1907.

<doc id="18363718" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18363718" title="Fideicommissum">
Fideicommissum

The fideicommissum was one of the most popular legal institutions in Roman Law for several centuries. It translates from the Latin word "fides" (trust) and "committere" (to commit), meaning that something is committed to one's trust.
Exegesis.
This fragment dates back to the time of Augustus, who for the first time sets up certain requirements for the institution of the "fideicommissum". The institution itself was first mentioned in 200 BC (Terence, "Andria" 290‚Äì98: "tuae mando fide").
A appoints B as an heir acting as a "fiduciarius" entrusted with passing the inheritance on to C, the so-called "fideicommisarius".
Purpose and enforceability.
The "fideicommissum" made possible that the "heres" could be left with the grantors desire to hand over the estate to the "proscripti", and the transfer would be carried out between them.
"Inst". 2.23.1 shows it was Augustus who made the "fideicommissum" legally binding by favouring it in individual cases. Thus its acceptance was directly based on Emperor‚Äôs Acts, but even previous to this the "fideicommissum" never lacked enforceability. The true reason for it lies in the nature of the institution itself. Personal security in Rome was far more important than it is today, mostly because the Romans attached more weight to the duties of a friendship. Therefore certain legal institutions were simply based on "bona fides" (e.g. the "tutela", "societas", "depositum"), which did not decrease but rather enforce their security. Breach of a fiduciary agreement lead inevitably to being "infamis", which meant the lifetime incapability of taking part in any commercial actions. This threat was force enough, and ensured the "fiduciaries" would not fail. As a matter of "honores", consideration was not required.
Applicability.
The great success of the "fideicommissum" as a clever "fraus legi fracta" is proved by reference to its long usage (redefined by Justinian I, it may have by his reign existed up to 700 years). The reasons lie in the great variety of cases it could deal with and the lack of formal requirements which had to be met.
The practical informality and flexibility of "fideicommissum" is described in "Inst". 2.23.2. There was no need for a certain formula, any word describing the beneficiaries, such as "rogo", "peto", or "volo", employed with the term ""fidei tuae committo"" sufficiently instituted a "fideicommissum". It could be constituted in a will or in a "codicil", made orally or even declared by mere gestures. Most attractive of all, it could be added or revoked or varied after the "institutio heredes" itself. Taking all these advantages in account, it is not surprising that the "legatus", with its strict formal requirements, was far less popular. In later eras, a gradual assimilation of "legates" and "fideicommissa" took place; under Justinian, the two institutions were fused, in an example of the vulgarisation of Roman Law after its classic era.
Restricted "capacitas".
Most important, the "fideicommissum" enabled transferring property by will to those excluded from inheriting. The "lex Voconia" in 169 BC for example did not allow women to be appointed as an heir of Romans listed as wealthy by the "censor". Later, Augustus enforced his "leges Julia" by introducing harsh "leges caducariae", which punished the unmarried and the childless by denying their "capacitas", the privilege of inheriting (the "Lex Julia de Maritandis Ordinibus" was passed in 18 BC and the "lex Papia Poppeia" in 9 AD ("Inst". 1.145)). The "fideicommissum" but enabled a prosperous "pater familias" to appoint his "amicus" as an heir, who would then be trusted with transferring the inherited property to the unmarried "filia". This would ensure her being provided for after his death.
Settlements.
Holding property within a family was of great importance for several reasons. Practically, it ensured the survival of the "familia", its name and wealth. Furthermore it was demanded by the sacral necessity of worshipping the "penates", who would cease to exist if the family did. Most important though, the Roman aristocracy relied on a careful and necessary balance of property, to ensure a balance of power. This could be guaranteed by installing a "fideicommissum". It was able to regulate the succession of several generations by will and hence incorporates the Roman root of family settlements. Unlike "legates", which only allowed passing estate on to a "heres", and "usufructus", which required a determinate person, the "fideicommissum" could be granted to "incertae personae". Using a fideicommissary substitution (making one "fideicommissum" subject to another, enabling the preservation of property within a family for generations through successive trusts) the grantor could therefore direct his "filius" to transfer the estate on to his son at death and so on in perpetuity.
Legacies.
"Legates" are by nature very similar to the "fideicommissum", but the latter did not suffer from the same restrictions. "Legates" could only be charged on a "heres", and the "lex Falcidia" in 41 BC constrained the legacy to three quarters of the entire inheritance. This of course did not apply for the "fideicommissum" and with such could be evaded.
Freeing slaves.
Another existing use of the "fideicommissum" is described in G 2.263-266: "libertas quoque servo per fideicommissum dari potest" if the "heres" or "legatarius" is requested to perform the "manumissio" to become the "patronus" of the slave so freed. 
Freeing slaves was attractive for the "dominus" for several reasons. Firstly, he could get rid of slaves who were of no use to him (because they were thugs, uneducated or incapable of working). Secondly, a freed slave owed the dominus who freed him "honor et sequi", including the procession to the grave. This led to a great number of slaves being freed on the death bed. Rome was gradually crowding with freed slaves, enlarging the poor classes within society. Therefore Augustus passed laws against luxury. They restricted liberation of slaves, but could be partly evaded by the "fideicommissum". The "fideicommissum" also gave way to granting the rights of a "patronus" to the person who was committed to freeing the slave.

Anastacio Caedo

Anastacio Tanchauco Caedo (14 August 1907‚Äì12 May 1990) was a Filipino sculptor. His style of sculpture was classical realist in the tradition of his mentor, Guillermo Tolentino. He produced commissioned representational sculptures mainly monuments of national heroes and successful Filipino politicians, businessmen, and educators. He was born in Macao, China and was brought here at the age of fourteen and stayed in Batangas with his parents Arsenio Caedo and Genoveva Tanchauco. His siblings were Esteban Tanchauco Caedo and Marcial Tanchauco Caedo.
Education.
At the age of 14,entary education at Calaca Elementary School in Batangas. In 1925, he entered the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. Even though lacking the required High School diploma in order to enter the university, Caedo made it to the UP College of Fine Arts through the direct recommendation of Professor Guillermo Tolentino. Thus, Caedo studied night high school while taking up Fine Arts at the UP.
Career.
Caedo's career as a sculptor began in the year 1925 when he worked with Guillermo E. Tolentino's atelier as student-assistant and prot√©g√©. He assisted Tolentino in creating most of his landmark commissions like: the "UP Oblation"; the "Bonifacio Monument" in Caloocan City; the "Rizal Monument" in front of the Rizal Provincial Capitol; and the "Shaw Monument" at Shaw Boulevard in Mandaluyong to name a few.
He graduated in 1932 from the UP College of Fine Arts
The U.P Oblation statue was actually modeled after the physique of Caedo because of his lean and muscular body (he was an amateur bodybuilder). Tolentino later relegated the task of building the other Oblation figures in U.P. Baguio and Manila to Caedo.
After World War II, Caedo was able to establish himself as a sculptor on the commissions from the Jesuits. He executed at least eight major works for the Jesuits. He was also commissioned to build the MacArthur Landing site in Palo, Leyte, as well as other monuments of Philippine national heroes.
Caedo was known for injecting vitality and breathing life into his sculptures, which became the hallmarks of his style. He was also commissioned to build the monuments of Bonifacio in Balintawak, Rizal in Germany, Juan Luna in Madrid, Apolinario Mabini in Manila, and Chief Kipua in Guam. He ultimately became known as a monument builder, and he built more monuments around the world than any other Filipino sculptor. For his lifelike bust of Rizal and his numerous monuments on Rizal, he was conferred the title "Knight Grand Commander" by the Order of the Knights of Rizal.
In 1951, he became a faculty member of the UP School of Fine Arts where he served for 20 years. He was appointed as Head of the Sculpture division of UP Fine Arts from 1957 to the early 1980s. His students and apprentices included Eduardo Castrillo, Abdul Mari Imao, and Ross Arcilla. Caedo's son, Florante Caedo, also learned sculpture from him, and became a noted sculptor in his own right.
Professor Caedo is also known as a meticulous portrait sculptor. His clients included Presidents Aguinaldo, Quezon, Osme√±a, Quirino, Aquino, and Marcos. He also created several portrait busts of famous movie stars, politicians, and businessmen.
Achievements and Famous Sculptural Works.
Professor Caedo refused several times the nomination to become a National Artist in 1983, 1984, and 1986. He died in 1990 at the age of 83.
Personal life.
Professor Caedo was married in 1937 to Ms. Florencia Beltran (1921‚Äì2003 )of Bicol. They had six children, one of whom-Florante Caedo- became a noted sculptor in his own right. Professor Caedo was known as a philanthropist, regularly donating portions of his earnings to charity. He was an active member of The Lion's Club and The Order of the Knights of Rizal.

Wairarapa South

Wairarapa South was a New Zealand parliamentary electorate from 1881 to 1887.
Population centres.
The previous electoral redistribution was undertaken in 1875 for the 1875‚Äì76 election. In the six years since, New Zealand's European population had increased by 65%. In the 1881 electoral redistribution, the House of Representatives increased the number of European representatives to 91 (up from 84 since the 1875‚Äì76 election). The number of MƒÅori electorates was held at four. The House further decided that electorates should not have more than one representative, which led to 35 new electorates being formed, including Wairarapa South, and two electorates that had previously been abolished to be recreated. This necessitated a major disruption to existing boundaries.
Wairarapa South was centred on the smaller Wairarapa towns of Featherston, Greytown, Carterton and Martinborough.
History.
The Wairarapa South electorate in the Wairarapa district of New Zealand and the adjacent Wairarapa North electorate were formed for the by splitting the old electorate. These electorates existed for two parliamentary terms from 1881 to 1887, when Wairarapa North was renamed Masterton, and Wairarapa South became the new Wairarapa electorate.
Between 1871 and 1881, the previous Wairarapa electorate had been a two-member electorate. One of the incumbents, George Beetham, successfully stood in 1881 in the Wairarapa North electorate. The other incumbent, Henry Bunny, who had represented Wairarapa since a by-election in , contested the Wairarapa South electorate in 1881 and was challenged by Walter Clarke Buchanan and Burton Boys. Bunny, Buchanan and Boys received 370, 436, and 133 votes, respectively, with Buchanan thus defeating Bunny.
The was contested by Bunny and Buchanan, who received 504 and 565 votes, respectively, and Buchanan was thus declared re-elected.
In 1887, Buchanan won the reconstituted Wairarapa electorate, again defeating Bunny.
Election results.
Wairarapa South was represented by one MP for all six years.

Liam Cooper

Liam David Ian Cooper (born 30 August 1991) is a professional footballer who plays for Chesterfield as a centre back.
Club career.
Hull City.
Born in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, Cooper attended Malet Lambert school and joined Hull City at Under-12 level. He was in the youth team that won the Football League Youth Alliance Cup Final against Colchester 3‚Äì0, scoring the opening goal but later being sent off for a deliberate handball.
On 26 August 2008 he made his first team debut for Hull against Swansea City in the Football League Cup. On 30 August 2008, on his 17th birthday, he signed professional terms with the club, and featured on the bench as an unused substitute for the Premier League game against Wigan Athletic. He made his first Premier League start on 26 September 2009 at Anfield in the 6‚Äì1 defeat by Liverpool. Cooper signed a new three-year contract at the KC Stadium in March 2010.
2010‚Äì11 season.
Having made three first team appearances for the 2010‚Äì11 season with little opportunity, Cooper was sent on loan to League One side Carlisle United on 10 January 2011 for a month long loan, as part of the deal which saw James Chester end his loan spell with Carlisle and join Hull City from Manchester United. The loan spell came to an early end when he sustained a hand injury in February in the match against Huddersfield Town. Following a return from injury, on 4 March 2011, Carlisle signed him on a further month loan with the option to extend it for the remainder of the season. Cooper decided to return to Hull at the end of the month loan rather than staying for the remainder of the season.
Huddersfield Town Loan.
On 8 July 2011, he joined League One club Huddersfield Town on a season-long loan. After making his full debut in the League Cup match against Port Vale in August, he made his league debut as a substitute in the 2‚Äì2 draw against Leyton Orient at the Galpharm Stadium on 24 September 2011. His first league start came a week later on 1 October 2011 in the 4‚Äì0 away win over Brentford followed by second star 3 days later on 4 October 2011 in the Football League Trophy second round exit to local rivals Bradford City when Cooper was taken off at half time due to injury.
Return To Hull.
On 1 December 2011, after being left out of the squad to play Charlton Athletic, Cooper asked for his loan to be terminated, so he could try and gain a place in new manager Nick Barmby's setup. Huddersfield agreed, and he returned to the KC Stadium.
At the end of March, Hull City captain, Jack Hobbs suffered a cruciate ligament rupture and ruled him out until Christmas 2012. Cooper filled the void, building a solid partnership with James Chester in the remaining few games of the campaign.

SMS Kaiser Franz Joseph I

SMS "Kaiser Franz Josef I" was a protected cruiser of the Austro-Hungarian Navy , the lead ship of the "Kaiser Franz Josef" class. Named in honor of the Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary, the cruiser and its sister ship, "Kaiserin Elisabeth", were built as a reply to the Italian cruisers "Giovanni Bausan" (1883) and "Etna" (1885).
Construction.
Built by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino at Trieste, "Kaiser Franz Josef I" was a steel-hulled vessel of 3,967 tons displacement, she measured in waterline length with a beam of and a mean draft of . The crew comprised 450 officers and men.
Technical Description.
Propulsion was supplied by two sets of horizontal triple-expansion engines with four cylindrical double-ended boilers. Designed performance was for and for ; on trials she in fact reached . 
Originally, "Kaiser Franz Josef I" and "Kaiserin Elisabeth" were each armed with two 9.4in (24cm) and six 6in (15cm) guns, both types Model 1886. "Kaiser Franz Josef I's" 9.4in (24cm) guns were mounted in fore and aft turrets, but owing to fiscal constraints those of "Kaiserin Elisabeth" had armored hoods instead. Both were reconstructed in 1905-06 with each rearmed with two long-barreled 15¬†cm and six short-barreled 15¬†cm guns, both types Model 1901. Rounding out the armament of each were sixteen 4.7¬†cm quick-firing guns, one machine gun and four torpedo tubes located above water, two on either beam. 
Service history.
Although "Kaiser Franz Josef I" burned enormous amounts of coal, in 1914 she could still steam at a very fair speed. At the outbreak of the First World War, "Kaiser Franz Josef I" was serving with the 2nd Cruiser Division. She took part in the shelling of enemy batteries on Mount Lovƒçen (which dominated Cattaro Bay) on 9 September 1914 and again on 8/9 January 1916. Later she was assigned to subsidiary local defense service at Cattaro. She was disarmed in 1917 for use as a floating headquarters.
Upon the defeat and dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, "Kaiser Franz Josef I " was
allocated to France as a war reparation. On her delivery voyage, however, she was overloaded with dismantled machinery and foundered in a gale off Kumbor in Cattaro Bay on 17 October 1919. 
Portions of the wreck were recovered by a Dutch company in 1922 and by Yugoslav salvagers in 1967.

Cliffords Mesne is a village in Gloucestershire, two miles south-west of the nearest town of Newent. It was the home of author Winifred Foley from the mid-1970s, after the success of her first book of reminiscences, "A Child in the Forest".
Facilities.
Cliffords Mesne is home to the Yew Tree Inn public house and the village is also known for its close proximity to May Hill, owned by the National Trust, and to the International Centre for Birds of Prey. There is a bus service to Ross-on-Wye consisting of a single journey on Thursdays. However, daily bus services between Gloucester and Ross-on-Wye pass through Kilcot (4¬†km). The nearest railway station is at Gloucester (20¬†km).
Heritage.
The small Anglican church is dedicated to St Peter. Designed by E.S. Harris, it was built in 1882 of stone with a central bellcote, nave, chancel, south porch, and south vestry. There is contemporary stained glass dedicated to a local falconer and a memorial tablet to two local men who died on active service in the Second World War. The church parish is merged with Gorsley. It shares clergy with Newent and lies in the Diocese of Gloucester. An earlier stone church built in Gothic style in 1872 and extended in 1877, became the village school (now closed). It now serves as a non-denominational village hall. The single listed historic building in Cliffords Mesne is the outlying Ravenshill Farmhouse, north of the village, most of which dates from the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The combined population of Cliffords Mesne and Gorsley was 1320 in 1876.

Yosumin!

Gameplay.
In "Yosumin!", the player tries to select rectangular regions in a grid of tiles that have the same type of yosumin at all four corners. The player has a target goal of the number of rectangles with yosumin of specific types that must be removed, and has a time limit. The larger the rectangle selected, the greater the number of points the player receives. Special yosumin are sometimes included, which when removed can give extra time or points. Later in the game another type of yosumin is added which can be moved, allowing the player to create rectangles of larger size. In multiplayer mode, two players face off in a larger grid. Creating rectangles can remove time from the opponent's timer, and specific yosumin which are selected before the game begins perform other moves such as stunning the opposing player. Wireless two-player competitive mode is playable through game sharing on the Nintendo DS with a single cartridge. Enhancements included new block types such as a block that rearranges the boards layout.
Development.
"Yosumin!" was originally a free browser-based game. The game was showcased in playable form at the Tokyo Game Show 2007. It was shown to be an enhanced port of the original "Yosumin" browser game released by Square Enix on the @nifty network. This was confirmed to be part of publisher Square Enixs' effort to expand their fan base internationally and across more types of players and genres, including more casual games. The game was available at Japanese Nintendo DS demo stations in November 2007. In November 2008 Square Enix trademarked Yosumin! In the United States. On January 26, 2009 Square Enix announced plans to release Yosumin on the Xbox Live Arcade as part of an initiative to put more games on Xboxs games service. On May 26, 2009, "Yosumin" was released over the digital distribution service Steam under the title "Yosumin!", and the following day was released on Xbox Live Arcade as "Yosumin! Live".
Reception.
The Xbox live version had minimal popularity, with fewer than 4,500 players on the games leader-board. Gamasutra cited the Japanese name and a high price as reasons for the games low popularity. IGN liked the PC version of the game, noting the loss of the Xbox Live Arcade multi-player but complimenting the expanded single player mode. UGO called the game its top sixth "Casual Games for Real Gamers", calling it fun and easy to learn.

Architecture criticism

Architecture criticism is a confused topic. Everyday criticism relates to published or broadcast critiques of buildings, whether completed or not, both in terms of news and other criteria. In many cases, criticism amounts to an assessment the architect's success in meeting his or her own aims and objectives and those of others. The assessment may consider the subject from the perspective of some wider context, which may involve planning, social or aesthetic issues. It may also take a polemical position reflecting the critic's own values. At the most accessible extreme, architectural criticism is a branch of lifestyle journalism, especially in the case of high-end residential projects.
Criticism is also a branch of academic study, practised not be architectural journalists but by architects and scholars. In this case, a different set of values is usually present, reflecting the intellectual apparatus of architectural practice and theory. Such criticism is usually published in professional and academic journals, and may be couched in language that lay readers find difficult to penetrate.
Most major national newspapers in developed countries cover the arts in some form. Architectural criticism may be included as a part of their arts coverage, in a real estate section or a "Home & Style" supplement. In the USA, reviews are published in specialist magazines ranging from the popular (e.g. Architectural Digest, Wallpaper) to specialist magazines for design professionals (e.g. Architectural Review, Detail). As with other forms of criticism, technical language is used to a varying extent to convey impressions and views precisely.
Lewis Mumford wrote extensively on architecture in the nineteen thirties, forties and fifties at "The New Yorker". Ada Louise Huxtable was the first full-time architecture critic working for an American daily newspaper when the New York Times gave her the role in 1963. John Betjeman, a co-founder of the Victorian Society, wrote and broadcast from the 1950s to 1970s, principally covering historic rather than new buildings, but contributing to a trend for criticism to expand into radio and then television. Charles, Prince of Wales, is outspoken in his criticism of modern architecture, memorably describing a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a "monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend".
Criteria.
The critic's task is to assess how successful the architect and others involved with the project have been in meeting both the criteria the project set out to meet and those that the critic himself feels to be important. Specific criteria include:
Architectural journalists.
Contemporary critics working for major newspapers include:
Specialist periodicals.

Neti (Hatha Yoga)

Neti is an important part of Hindu Shatkarma (sometimes known as Shatkriya), the yogic system of body cleansing techniques that is an integral part of Hinduism. It is intended mainly to the cleaning of the air passageways in the head. Both the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and other sources usually attribute to Neti many beneficial effects that range from profound physiological ones on the body, mind and personality to even clairvoyance. The two main variants are jala neti using water and the more advanced sutra neti using string.
Jala neti.
For this technique, sterilized and lukewarm isotonic salt water is poured into one nostril, so that it leaves through the other. The procedure is then repeated on the other side, and the nose is dried by bending forward and by rapid breathing.
It is also possible to sniff the water in so that it runs into the mouth, and to spit it out. In a more advanced reverse variant, the water is taken in through the mouth and snorted out of the nose.
Sutra neti.
In sutra neti, a length of wet string or thin surgical tubing is carefully and gently inserted through the nose and into the mouth. The end is then pulled out of the mouth and while holding both ends at once the string is alternately pulled in and out of the nose and sinuses. It is used to clear the nose and also to remove nasal polyps. 
Sutra neti is an advanced form of yogic nasal cleansing and requires an experienced teacher. Sensations of gagging, nausea, and weakness may occur. In case of persistent blockage after jala neti, sutra neti should only be performed after a medical consultation.

Mesivta

Mesivta (also metivta; , "academy") is an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva high school for boys. The term is commonly used in the United States to describe a yeshiva that emphasizes Talmudic studies for boys in grades 9 through 11 or 12; alternately, it refers to the religious studies track in a yeshiva high school that offers both religious and secular studies. The comparable term in Israel is yeshiva ketana (, lit. "small yeshiva"). After graduation from a mesivta, students progress to a beis medrash, or undergraduate-level, yeshiva program.
In practice, yeshivas that call themselves mesivtas are usually a combination of mesivta (high-school) and beis medrash (post-high-school) programs. Students in the beis medrash program are often called upon to mentor those in the mesivta.
History.
In Talmudic and Geonic eras.
The term "metivta" first appears in the Talmud, where it refers to a yeshiva of Talmudic sages. Rav learned in the metivta in Tzippori under Judah ha-Nasi, his son, and grandson. Under the leadership of Rav and Shmuel, the Talmudic Academy of Sura during the Babylonian Exile was called a "sidra", but under Rav Huna, the second dean of the Academy of Sura, the yeshiva began to be called a "metivta" and Huna was the first to hold the title of "resh metivta" (corresponding to "rosh yeshiva"). According to Graetz, the metivta convened in certain months of the year. Metivta frameworks continued to operate throughout the era of the Geonim, a period of approximately 1,000 years.
Modern-day concept.
Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz introduced the concept of a mesivta as a Talmudic studies program for boys aged 14 and older in New York in 1926. Until that time, religious boys attended Talmud Torah (elementary school) until their bar mitzvah and then went on to public high school and college, where their level of Torah observance and commitment were sorely tested. The only post-bar mitzvah religious education available at the time was at Yeshivat Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchonon, which prepared students for a career in the rabbinate. When Rabbi Mendlowitz, who had begun teaching at the Yeshiva Torah Vodaas elementary school in 1923, suggested the innovation, he was met with widespread resistance. An editorial in the Yiddish Morgen Journal stated:
Just as the Reform have a rabbinical Seminary in Cincinnati, and the Conservative have the Solomon Schechter Seminary in New York, so should Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchonon suffice produce Orthodox rabbis.
With the support of three Torah Vodaas board members ‚Äì Binyomin Wilhelm, Ben Zion Weberman, and Abraham Lewin ‚Äì Rabbi Mendlowitz successfully opened Mesivta Torah Vodaas in its own building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in September 1926. The mesivta opened with four classes of post-bar mitzvah students and 11 students in the advanced, beis medrash program. The mesivta went on to graduate generations of students who became Torah scholars and leaders in the American Jewish world.
Rabbi Mendlowitz also influenced the administration at Yeshivas Chaim Berlin to expand beyond eighth grade and open a mesivta as well. Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin opened in the 1930s. Other mesivtas founded in the 1930s and 1940s were Mesivta Tifereth Jerusalem, Kaminetzer Mesivta of Boro Park, and Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. In the 1950s, the latter four mesivtas had their own basketball league.
In 1937 Rabbi Mendlowitz founded Camp Mesivta, the first yeshiva summer camp in America, in Ferndale, New York. This became the summer camp of choice for thousands of students from other yeshivas and a prototype for yeshiva learning camps in later decades. Rabbi Mendlowitz instituted the practice of inviting Gedolim to visit the camp for a few days or a few weeks, giving campers the experience of seeing Torah greats in action. The Gedolim who regularly stayed at Camp Mesivta included Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky, Rabbi Shlomo Heiman, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, and Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz. Camp Mesivta operated until the early 1960s; in 1966, it was succeeded by Camp Ohr Shraga-Beis Medrash LeTorah in Greenfield Park, New York, headed by Rabbi Zelik Epstein and Rabbi Nesanel Quinn.
Mesivtas today.
Today mesivtas are located in cities throughout the United States that have a sizable Orthodox Jewish population. Since the 1980s, the number of mesivtas in the New York/New Jersey area has mushroomed. Whereas before there were at most a handful of schools to choose from, today every city with a religious Jewish population and nearly every township has a yeshiva high school. Because of the proliferation, mesivtas have developed reputations that reflect the academic level of their students. There are schools for "metzuyanim" (top learners), schools for average students, and schools for students with "serious scholastic and/or "yirat shamayim" (religious belief) challenges". Some mesivtas operate different "tracks" to satisfy a diverse student body.
Mesivtas, like yeshivas, do not follow the public education schedule of terms and vacations, but organize the school year according to the Jewish calendar. School is in recess during Jewish holidays, and the term ends in the month of Av, the traditional break for yeshivas since the days of the Talmud. There is also a dress code: whereas in elementary school, boys wear casual clothes to school, upon entering mesivta, they are expected to dress in dark suits and white shirts.
Other uses.
Mesivta is an imprint of Machon Oz Vehadar for its Talmud Bavli series, published in conjunction with the worldwide Daf yomi schedule.

Alberta Health Services (AHS) is the single health authority for the Canadian province of Alberta.
Alberta Health Services delivers medical care on behalf of the Government of Alberta's Ministry of Health through 400 facilities throughout the province, including hospitals, clinics, continuing care facilities, mental health facilities and community health sites, while providing a variety of programs and services.
AHS is the largest single health authority in Canada and is the largest employer in the province of Alberta as well as being the 5th largest single employer in Canada.
Alberta Health Services is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta.

Alberta Health Services was created as a "superboard" in May 2008 with the controversial abolition of the following regional health authorities:
as well as the following agencies:
Health services in Alberta have undergone several governance reorganization attempts in recent decades, with successively fewer separate public organizational entities.
Mission and organization.
Alberta Health Services has articulated three broad goals (access, quality and sustainability) which expand into eight 'areas of focus' (e.g. improving access, fit for the future, learning and improving) and 20 strategic priorities.
Alberta Health Services has been organized so as to separate acute hospital facilities (with separate reporting lines for major tertiary, metropolitan and regional hospitals) from smaller hospitals and community services, the latter of which are organized into five zones (North, Edmonton, Central, Calgary and South). The Calgary Zone, for example, includes some sites and services formerly administered by the Calgary Health Region while other services have been reorganized on a provincial scale.
Leadership.
Edmonton-based Dr. Stephen Duckett was the inaugural President and Chief Executive Officer of Alberta Health Services, taking up the role on 23 March 2009. He was replaced on 23 November 2010 by Dr. Chris Eagle who resigned on 17 October 2013. The organization was previously overseen by a Board of Directors, on June 12, 2013, an Official Administrator, Janet Davidson, for Alberta Health Services was appointed by the Minister of Health Fred Horne, to act in place of its Board of Directors. On September 12, 2013, Dr. John W. F. Cowell replaced Davidson as the Official Administrator.

Joan Brotat

Joan Brotat (1920‚Äì1990) was a painter born in Barcelona. He studied at the School of Arts and Trades of Barcelona and his work was first exhibited at one cycle of experimental art organised in 1950. Before his first exhibition, Brotat had a brief period of Informalism and experimentation with collages and gestual art. He also cultivated a post-modernist painting style with conventional themes, but in 1949 his work began to take on a personal primitivist as a reinvention of Romanesque Catalan painting. Brotat abandoned all experimental concern for new non-figurative forms of expression and became the painter of melancholy faces.
The personal papers of Joan Brotat are preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

Norbreck Castle Hotel

Norbreck Castle Hotel is a large hotel located on Queens Promenade in the Norbreck area of Blackpool, Lancashire England on the sea front. The hotel has 480 bedrooms and 22 conference suites including the Norcalympia Conference Centre.
History.
Originally built as a large private country house in 1869, it was purchased around the end of the 19th century by J.H. Shorrocks who used the house to entertain friends and colleagues at lavish weekend parties. The popularity of these parties led to Shorrocks running them on a commercial basis by taking paying guests. 
In 1912, Shorrocks formed a public company and expanded the building, now named the Norbreck Hydro, in several phases, adding a ballroom, swimming pool and solarium in the early 1930s. By then the Hydro was patronised by nobility and the British upper class, in addition to being a venue for the top stars of stage, screen and radio.
During World War II the hotel was commandeered by the British government as offices and accommodation for evacuated civil servants. The hotel remained under government control for eleven years until being handed back in 1951. At that time the hotel had - Open air car parking for 250 cars, five tennis courts, an 18 hole golf course, a bowling green, a 600 seat restaurant, a ballroom which when used for conferences seated 850, a second smaller ballroom for private parties, two cocktail bars, a swimming pool and 400 bedrooms, 97 of which had private bathrooms.
In the late 1970s, the hotel's disco became the venue for a number of concerts by punk rock, new wave and Mod revival bands. Those who played there included the Angelic Upstarts, Penetration and the Purple Hearts. The venue also saw gigs by two bands before they became famous. Adam and the Ants performed there when they were still a punk rock band in March 1979, a performance which One Way System drummer Dave Brown, listed in his top five gigs. And on 15 March 1979, The Pretenders played one of their first ever gigs at the Norbreck.
In 1988, the hotel was the venue for a conference where the Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party merged to form the Liberal Democrats. Writing in the New Statesman about the merger, the writer Jonathan Calder said of the hotel, "Blackpool‚Äôs Norbreck Castle Hotel does not lift the spirit at the best of times, and in January 1988 its Soviet ambience was enhanced by the trams and melting snow in the streets outside."
In 2003, a group of fifteen children who had just returned from Hong Kong to study at Rossall School were isolated at the hotel over SARS concerns and were kept in a self-contained wing with a nurse. However, they had to be removed by Rossall School for their safety when hotel guests found out the children were staying there, after the story was leaked to the local press and what was described as an "abusive mob" of hotel guests forced the children to be removed from the hotel.
Facilities.
The hotel contains two restaurants and two bars. The hotel has its own 35 seat cinema and a games room as well as a health and leisure club. The hotel has 22 conference, meeting and banqueting rooms, the largest of which can accommodate 3,000 people.
Events.
The Norcalympia is host to a number of events. In November 2001 the BUPA Care Homes Open tournament, an indoor bowls World Bowls Tour competition was held at the venue and filmed live on BBC Two. The venue is also host to the largest annual Elvis Presley contest convention in Europe, the "European Elvis Competition". Other events held there include the "Blackpool Classic Motorcycle Show", and the "Classic" snooker tournament between 1987 and 1990. It also hosts the biggest Model Boat show in the UK in October every year, with even a purpose built indoor pool.

Robert C. Kettler

Robert Charles "Bob" Kettler (born 1952) is an American real estate developer and founder of the Washington D.C. area development company Kettler.
Coming from a long line of real estate developers, Kettler has been around the real estate business his entire life. Kettler's father and uncle were successful home builders in the 1950s and 1960s, and his grandfather developed apartments in the 1920s. Kettler got his start in real estate remodeling apartments while still a student at George Washington University in 1974. He quickly worked his way up to large projects and co-founded Kettler & Scott, Inc. as the majority owner in 1977. The firm was later renamed "KSI Services," and then as the company's prominence grew, the name became "Kettler."
Kettler's career started to take off in the mid-1980s. His first large-scale project - a 3,000 home community in western Fairfax County - helped Kettler discover his talent for planning large-scale, multi-use properties. Kettler has developed many of the largest planned communities in the Washington D.C. Metro Area, large mixed-use commercial properties and several country clubs/golf courses. Developments include over 25 planned communities and more than 46,000 homes, including the 6,050-home community Cascades in Loudoun County, Virginia; the 2,434-home community Piedmont in Prince William County, Virginia; and the 2,600-home community Lorton Station in Fairfax County, Virginia. The company has developed more than 5 million square feet of mixed-used commercial space, including the 1.2-million-square-foot Trinity Centre mixed-use office park in Fairfax County, Virginia, and the 1.3-million-square-foot Village At Leesburg Town Center in Loudon County, Virginia. The company currently has 4.3 million square feet of commercial space development in the pipeline. Among his most notable projects are Lowes Island Club in Loudoun County and the Piedmont Golf Club in Prince William County. 
In addition to planned communities, Kettler has developed some of the region‚Äôs most successful multifamily communities, including national award-winners The Metropolitan at Pentagon City, The Metropolitan at Reston Town Center, Midtown Reston Town Center and The Millennium at Metropolitan Park. The company has developed more than 15,400 apartments and condominiums within 65 communities. Over the last five years Kettler‚Äôs condominium communities in North Bethesda, Maryland, and Reston, Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia, were the Washington, DC Metropolitan area‚Äôs top selling projects with gross sales in excess of $700 million. Additionally, Kettler is the largest developer of affordable housing in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan area. The company has a portfolio of 33 properties with over 6,500 bond-financed apartments that are owned and operated by Kettler. 
Kettler has five multifamily projects in development, consisting of nearly 1,700 apartments in Washington, D.C., Columbia Town Center, Maryland, and Pentagon City, Crystal City and Tysons Corner, Virginia. In 2012 Kettler will break ground on two luxury high-rise apartment buildings. The Acadia at Metropolitan Park will mark the final phase of Kettler‚Äôs Metropolitan Park project in Pentagon City, Virginia, with a 411 unit, high-end apartment building. A mixed-use residential development at 450 K Street in Washington, D.C., will feature 233 apartments. 
In 1986, Kettler was named as the National Association of Homebuilders developer of the year. In 2006, he received a lifetime achievement award known of the Monument Award from the Northern Virginia Building Industry Association. He has also received numerous awards from Fairfax County, the Urban Land Institute, and various community & industry associations. The Washington Times has called him "one of the region's most successful businessmen." 
In 1988, Kettler established Kettler Management, the property management division of his company. The wholly owned subsidiary manages more than 19,000 apartment units in 85 communities and over 1.7 million square feet of office and retail space. In the last two years the company has expanded into several new markets, including New York City, New Jersey, North Carolina and the Virginia Beach and Richmond areas in Virginia. In 2008, Kettler Management received the National Property Management Company of the Year award. In 2012, Kettler Management will add over 5,000 apartment units to its portfolio. As of February 2012 more than 550 people were employed by Kettler. In 2010 Kettler had an annual revenue of more than $407.5 million.
Kettler has also served on numerous boards of directors included those of the Northern Virginia Building Industry Association, the Northern Virginia Political Action Committee, the Washington Metropolitan Area Boys Club, and Venture America. He has also served on advisory boards at George Mason University and Northern Virginia Community College. In 2006 KSI Services bought the naming rights to the Washington Capitals practice arena, which became Kettler Capitals Iceplex.
Kettler attended the George Washington University and American University from 1970 to 1974, studying economics and real estate. He has been married to his wife Charlotte for 29 years. Since 2003, Kettler and his wife, Charlotte, have served as co-chairs of a $50 million capital campaign that led to a transformational redevelopment of the Potomac School. They have four children and live in McLean, Virginia.

Symphony No. 6 (Mozart)

Symphony No. 6 in F major, K. 43, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1767. According to Alfred Einstein in his 1937 revision of the K√∂chel catalogue, the symphony was probably begun in Vienna and completed in Olomouc, a Moravian town to which the Mozart family fled to escape a Viennese smallpox epidemic; see Mozart and smallpox.
The symphony is in four movements, and is Mozart's first in the key of F. Its initial performance was at Brno on 30 December 1767 The autograph of the score is today preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska in Krak√≥w.
Movements and instrumentation.
The instrumentation for the first performance was: 2 flutes; 2 oboes; 2 horns; bassoon; strings and keyboard continuo. The flutes are used in the second movement in place of the oboes. For the first time in a symphony, Mozart uses two obligatory viola parts.
\relative c' {
</score>
This is Mozart's first four-movement symphony, in which he introduces the Minuet and Trio for the first time, a feature common in many of his symphonies thereafter. The movements are:
The Andante movement uses a theme from Mozart's early Latin opera "Apollo et Hyacinthus", K. 38, in which "muted violins sing over pizzicato seconds and divided violas, a ravishing effect".
First performance.
The symphony was included in a concert arranged by Count von Schrattenbach, brother of the Archbishop of Salzburg, given by the Mozart family on 30 December 1767 at the Taverna in Brno. A local clergyman recorded: "I attended a musical concert in a house in the city known as the "Taverna", at which a Salzburg boy of eleven years and his sister of fifteen years, accompanied on various instruments by inhabitants of Brno, excited everyone's admiration"

Halaf culture

The Halaf culture, is a prehistoric period which lasted between about 6100 and 5500 BCE. The period is a continuous development out of the earlier Pottery Neolithic and is located primarily in south-eastern Turkey, Syria, and northern Iraq, although Halaf-influenced material is found throughout Greater Mesopotamia.
While the period is named after the site of Tell Halaf in north Syria, excavated by Max von Oppenheim between 1911 and 1927, the earliest Halaf period material was excavated by John Garstang in 1908 at the site of Sakce G√∂z√º, then in Syria but now part of Turkey. Small amounts of Halaf material was also excavated in 1913 by Leonard Woolley at Carchemish, on the Turkish/Syrian border. However, the most important site for the Halaf tradition was the site of Tell Arpachiyah, now located in the suburbs of Mosul, Iraq.
The Halaf period was succeeded by the Halaf-Ubaid Transitional period (~5500 - 5200 cal. BCE) and then by the Ubaid period (~5200 - 4000 cal. BCE).
Economy.
Dryland farming was practiced by the population. This type of farming was based on exploiting natural rainfall without the help of irrigation, in a similar practice to that still practiced today by the Hopi people of Arizona. Emmer wheat, two-rowed barley and flax were grown. They kept cattle, sheep and goats.
Architecture.
Although no Halaf settlement has been extensively excavated some buildings have been excavated: the tholoi of Tell Arpachiyah, circular domed structures approached through long rectangular anterooms. Only a few of these structures were ever excavated. They were constructed of mud-brick sometimes on stone foundations and may have been for ritual use (one contained a large number of female figurines). Other circular buildings were probably just houses.
Halaf pottery.
The best known, most characteristic pottery of Tell Halaf, called Halaf ware, produced by specialist potters, can be painted, sometimes using more than two colors (called polychrome) with geometric and animal motifs. Other types of Halaf pottery are known, including unpainted, cooking ware and ware with burnished surfaces. There are many theories about why the distinctive pottery style developed. The theory is that the pottery came about due to regional copying and that it was exchanged as a prestige item between local elites is now disputed. The polychrome painted Halaf pottery has been proposed to be a "trade pottery"‚Äîpottery produced for export‚Äîhowever, the predominance of locally produced painted pottery in all areas of Halaf sites including potters settlement questions that theory.
Halaf pottery has been found in other parts of northern Mesopotamia, such as at Nineveh and Tepe Gawra, Chagar Bazar and at many sites in Anatolia (Turkey) suggesting that it was widely used in the region. In addition, the Halaf communities made female figurines of partially baked clay and stone and stamp seals of stone, (see also Impression seal). The seals are thought to mark the development of concepts of personal property, as similar seals were used for this purpose in later times. The Halaf people used tools made of stone and clay. Copper was also known, but was not used for tools.

The Confessionals

The Confessionals is a group of anonymous forums maintained by Oberlin graduate Shibo Xu and developed by various short-term collaborators. They provide a space for college and university students to speak openly and candidly, often on taboo subjects. They've become a source for advice, but have also generated controversy over the prevalence of anonymous personal attacks.
History.
The first confessional created was Oberlin Confessional, created by Harris Lapiroff based on an idea he'd gotten from a similar Livejournal community. This original confessional gained in popularity until its original creator left, after which Shibo assumed control of the site.
Controversy.
When introduced to a college, the confessional often generates a lot of controversy, particularly if it has become a source for anonymous personal attacks. Using the names of others is strictly prohibited under the terms and conditions of the Confessional, but names often appear in violation of these rules. Although these confessions are usually removed from the site, they have the ability to do considerable damage while they remain visible. As such, the administrations of many colleges have spoken out forcefully against these forums, but are usually unable to do more without being accused of censorship
Some critics seriously question whether anonymous attacks against individuals qualifies as "protected" "free speech". Some critics, including prominent legislators, are taking a close look at the degree to which an institution such as a college, Connecticut College for example, may be liable for continued inaction in regard to confessional sites linked to their institutions. Legal action is currently pending in some cases.
Confessionals.
There are currently confessionals for ten different colleges and universities:
Middlebury Confessional
Oberlin Confessional
Amherst Confessional
Mount Holyoke Confessional
Connecticut College Confessional
Kalamazoo Confessional
Smith Confessional 
UMass Confessional 
Cornell Confessional 
Iowa State Confessional 
In addition to the confessionals above, Shibo has created a joint confessional, open to the public, for the summer of 2008. The summer confessional was bought back again for the summer of 2011:

Samarra culture

At Tell es-Sawwan, evidence of irrigation‚Äîincluding flax‚Äîestablishes the presence of a prosperous settled culture with a highly organized social structure. The culture is primarily known for its finely-made pottery decorated against dark-fired backgrounds with stylized figures of animals and birds and geometric designs. This widely-exported type of pottery, one of the first widespread, relatively uniform pottery styles in the Ancient Near East, was first recognized at Samarra. The Samarran Culture was the pre-cursor to the Mesopotamian culture of the Ubaid period.

<doc id="18364479" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18364479" title="MDU Resources">
MDU Resources

MDU Resources Group, Inc. () is a U.S. diversified energy company, with electric and natural gas utility distribution operations in Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming.
Background.
MDU Resources got its start in 1924 as the Minnesota Northern Power Company. Its founder, Rolland Heskett, had previously been involved with utilities in Wisconsin and northeast Minnesota (the forerunners of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Minnesota Power, respectively). The Minnesota Northern Power holdings initially consisted of the electric utility at Cushing, Oklahoma (quickly sold off to Oklahoma Gas & Electric), Minnesota Electric Light & Power Company, which served the Bemidji, Minnesota area (sold in 1925 to the W. B. Foshay interests‚Äîthis property today comprises Otter Tail Power's Bemidji division), and the Eastern Montana Light & Power Company, which was centered around Sidney and Glendive, Montana, and which became the nucleus of MDU's operations.
Initially, Minnesota Northern was only in the business of selling electric power, but entered the gas business following discovery of deposits in Eastern Montana. As Minnesota Northern expanded across Eastern Montana and western North Dakota, it acquired the electric franchise for Miles City, Montana after an acquisition struggle with the Montana Power Company.
Shortly after passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), Heskett reorganized all the gas and electric subsidiaries of Minnesota Northern Power under a new name‚ÄîMontana-Dakota Utilities.
Unlike its neighboring utilities, MDU was generally not in the business of reselling energy at wholesale to other companies, with the exception of five Eastern Montana towns then served by the Mountain States Power Company. The distribution systems in these towns passed into MDU ownership by the early 1940s.
On June 10, 2000, The Westmoreland Coal Company and the Knife River Corporation, a subsidiary of the MDU Resources Group, said that they had entered exclusive talks for the sale of Knife River's coal operations to Westmoreland.
Acquisition and lawsuit.
The largest addition of electric utility territory came in 1945, when MDU purchased the Dakota Public Service Company (DPSC) from NorthWestern Public Service Company (NWPS) of Huron, South Dakota. DPSC served a total of 91 towns in west-central North Dakota originally served by the Hughes Electric Company/North Dakota Power & Light Company (NDP&L) and south-central North Dakota/north-central South Dakota originally served by the Northern Power & Light Company (NP&L). When MDU examined DPSC's books after the purchase, they spent the next six years in litigation with NWPS over allegations of improper internal charges between NWPS, NP&L, and NDP&L. Both companies eventually realized the lawsuit was unproductive and they ceased litigation.
After the end of the lawsuit, MDU refocused on the growing demand for electricity and gas within its newly expanded territory and the necessary system improvements. In the late 1960s, MDU partnered with NWPS and Otter Tail Power in the construction of the Big Stone power plant near Big Stone City, South Dakota. MDU also briefly explored a merger with Otter Tail but both parties decided not to pursue this. The companies have since partnered on two base-load power plants (Big Stone and Coyote). By the 1980s, when the revenue from the utility operations began to plateau, it reorganized into MDU Resources and began an aggressive program of diversification into closely related but unregulated industries. This diversification program has succeeded to the point where the utility operations are no longer the company's main source of revenue. Even so, MDU Resources provides natural gas to about 440,000 residential customers and electricity to about 92,000 residential customers today.
Subsidiaries.
Cascade Natural Gas Corporation, serving parts of Oregon and Washington, was acquired by MDU in 2007. Intermountain Gas Company, serving parts of Idaho, was acquired by MDU in 2008. Knife River Corporation provides construction-related products and services, including aggregate, asphalt, building materials, cement, construction services, liquid asphalt, and ready-mix concrete in 13 states.

Grand-H√¥tel du Cap-Ferrat

The Grand-H√¥tel du Cap-Ferrat is a five star hotel, situated in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat in the French Riviera.
Luxury hotels were invented to be the stuff of dreams. The highest ranking of all the many ‚Äúpalaces‚Äù that
sprang up all over the French Riviera, the Grand-H√¥tel du Cap-Ferrat overlooks the sea from the
furthermost tip of the peninsula from which it takes its name.
History.
At the turn of the 20th Century, Cap-Ferrat was little more than a wilderness of rocks and dense scrubland, vegetation that only changed as real estate began to develop there. At the end of the 19th century, piece by piece, King Leopold II of Belgium
purchased the peninsula‚Äôs only wooded area, and then proceeded to expand his estate by buying up
most of the vacant land around.
Shortly before 1900, Leopold sold part of his property to a company founded by a Mr. P√©retm√®re, the son of a coachman from the north who had some savings of his own. He reserved six and a half hectares of the land for the hotel, whose construction began in 1908 with the two wings built at an open angle to each other, then the following year a loggia dining room and the large, central Rotonde were added. By then the building had its final, distinctive silhouette, remarkably simple for the time. A little later, the Grand-H√¥tel was bought by Madame Ferras, a widow and the grandmother of famous violinist Christian Ferras.
From Hotel to Hospital.
The First World War broke out shortly after the new owner‚Äôs arrival and the hotel became a hospital. In 1922, two professional hoteliers, Messrs Henri Dehouve and Andr√© Voyenne (my father), acquired a majority shareholding and took over the running of
the company. They were to remain in charge for over twenty years, a period marked not only by the Great Depression and the Second World War, but also by a complete revolution in holidaying habits.
When the sun was the enemy.
Since it first became known in the second half of the 19th Century, and up until the 1930s, the French Riviera remained almost exclusively a luxury destination. Most visitors were either wealthy individuals of independent means or royalty from northern countries, in particular England and Russia. They came only in winter and for long visits. Queen Victoria and her court, numerous aristocratic families, Princess Louise, the Duke of Connaught, President Paul Deschanel and many other politicians of the French 3rd
Republic, the pianist Marguerite Long, the violinist Jacques Thibaud, and movie stars such as Charles Boyer, Charlie Chaplin and many others were to follow.
The summer season emerges.
Not until 1930 did a few unconventional visitors venture down to the Riviera in summertime, mostly avant-garde writers and artists. They all came in search of solitude, since practically nobody came then, and relished a certain snobbery surrounding their alternative style of travelling. In Cap-Ferrat itself, these new habits arrived purely by chance. During the summer of 1933, the German filmmaker G.W. Pabst persuaded Chaliapine to star in his version of Don Quixote. Since he did not have the funds to film in Spain, the director decided that Cap-Ferrat‚Äôs landscape would be perfectly suitable. One day, the film crew appeared at the hotel, which was closed at the time but nevertheless offered them improvised accommodation for a few weeks. The actors and film crew were so delighted with their stay in this heavenly location that many of them asked to return the following year for a private visit. Little by little, the summer season emerged, attracting a whole new generation of holidaymakers, younger and more athletic than their predecessors and seeking sun and sea above all else. Since the hotel‚Äôs rocky coastline made it difficult to reach the sea, a cove was blasted from the rock.
The dark years, then a revival and metamorphosis.
A few weeks after the beginning of the war, the Grand-H√¥tel was boarded up and plunged into darkness for six long years. On March 5, 1944, in preparation for an allied landing, the entire peninsula was evacuated and riddled with mines. Local inhabitants were given only a few hours to grab some of their belongings and flee. Thankfully, the hotel and swimming pool survived entirely unscathed by nearby shelling and by the explosion that destroyed the lighthouse.
Text: extracts by Andr√© Voyenne
Other illustrious guests were the novelist Somerset Maugham, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill and Aristote Onassis.
The legendary swimming instructor, Pierre Gruneberg, has given lessons to Picasso, as well to both Paul McCartney‚Äôs and Frank Sinatra‚Äôs children.
Metamorphosis.
2009 will see the completion of a metamorphosis that blends tradition, innovation and respect for
nature.
The extension will be built in two phases while the hotel is closed from October to April 2007-
2008 and 2008‚Äì2009, and will open in May 2009.
The project was designed by architect Luc Svetchine and comprises 16 rooms, 8 suites with private plunge pools, a 7500sq.feet spa
with indoor swimming pool and the creation of two new suites on the garden level of the main building.
The grounds are the work of landscape gardener Jean Mus. With the construction of new underground car parks, the above-ground parking areas will disappear.
Rooms and suites.
As of May 1, 2009, the Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat will propose 74 rooms (including 24 suites and the Penthouse), a spa & fitness center and a presidential suite, the Villa Rose-Pierre with its sea-view and pine grove.
Restaurants.
The Grand-H√¥tel serves food from three locations: at the Le Cap Gastronomic Restaurant, on its terrace overlooking the Mediterranean and shaded by Aleppo pines, or at the Club Dauphin Restaurant next to the pool.
Vintage wines.
The Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat maintains a collection of well-known vintage wines:
Music Festival.
The Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat Music Festival
Artistic director : Michael Desjardins
The Festival is an up-to-date version of the tradition of salon music, which dates back to centuries past, and of the jazz clubs and Parisian caf√©-theatres where audiences would rub shoulders with the artists. The Rotonde, designed by Gustave Eiffel, is a comfortable venue with outstanding acoustics.
The programme spans every genre of vocal and instrumental music from all eras: opera, classical music, baroque music, film soundtracks, international variety, jazz, traditional music, and first performances of original works of contemporary
music.

Maccabi Haifa B.C.

Maccabi Haifa Basketball Club () is a professional Israeli basketball club that belongs to the Maccabi Haifa association. After a 10-year absence, the team returned to the top division in 2008‚Äì09 and, within just a single season in 2012‚Äì13, has become a nation-scale leading team and achieved its ever-first championship.
History.
The club is one of the oldest in the country and it is one of the original eight teams that formed the top division in 1953. In 1971 and 1985, the club qualified for the State Cup finals losing to Maccabi Tel Aviv.
The club was relegated to the second division in 1993, and dropped into the third tier in 1995. Although they returned to Ligat HaAl in 1999, the following year Haifa mayor Amram Mitzna merged the club with Hapoel Haifa to form BC Haifa.
Although the club qualified for the playoffs twice, they began to experience financial difficulties. Upon relegation the club folded and sold its rights to Bnei HaSharon.
In 2004 Maccabi Haifa officials changed the name of the second team under its control, Maccabi Bat Galim, to Maccabi Haifa in an effort to restore the club's glory days.
The following season, the club was promoted to the northern division. In 2007 they were promoted to Liga Leumit under the leadership of the coach Tobi Slilat. After the club was promoted, Avi Ashkenazi (who had coached the team in 1995) was reappointed.
The team was purchased by Jeffrey Rosen (who had previously tried to buy Hapoel Tel Aviv) in July 2007. Rosen pledged that the club would be promoted to Ligat HaAl in his first year of ownership. Deon Thomas, a former player at Maccabi Tel Aviv, was signed to play for the club, which team changed its name to "Maccabi Haifa Heat".
In the 2007‚Äì08 season they finished in fourth place in Liga Leumit, and earned promotion after winning the best-of-five semi-finals 3‚Äì1 against first seed Maccabi Elitzur Netanya.
2008‚Äì09 season.
The 2008‚Äì09 season marked the first year in which the Maccabi Haifa Heat played in the Israeli Premier League's top division under American owner Jeff Rosen. Prior to entering their 2008‚Äì09 season Maccabi Haifa had not played in the league's top division (also known as "The Super League") since 1999. Before the season began the team signed a multitude of talent to its roster which immediately took notice from around the league.
Notable pre-season signings include:
‚Ä¢ Davon Jefferson, who played at University of Southern California with current NBA player O.J. Mayo.‚Ä¢ Tamir Goodman, dubbed the "Jewish Jordan" by "Sports Illustrated".‚Ä¢ Todd Golden, a star guard out of St. Mary's College of California, who was named to the 2008 All-America First Team by Jewish Sports Review.‚Ä¢Ben Strong, the 6-foot, 11-inch center and former Division III Player of the Year out of Guilford College. Strong was the first Native American basketball player to play professionally in Israel.‚Ä¢ BJ McKie (All-Time leading scorer at University of South Carolina), Brooks Sales (Villanova), and Doron Perkins (Santa Clara University).‚Ä¢Ido Kozikaro (center) also plays for the Israeli National Team.
On October 26, 2008, Maccabi Haifa started its season winning its first 3 games by an average margin score of 21 points per game and won 7 of its first 9 games before running into its rival Maccabi Tel Aviv in an 80‚Äì68 loss. With Haifa Heats early success, they earned a trip to the Israeli Cup Tournament. February 19, 2009 became the first time in the new era of the Maccabi Haifa franchise in which they competed in the Cup finals. In the Cup Finals they faced opponent Hapoel Holon in which they lost in a dramatic fashion as Holon walked away with a 69‚Äì68 Israeli Cup Championship victory. Led by team captain Doron Perkins the team finished the season with a 14‚Äì8 record (3rd place), reaching the Israeli League playoffs in the team's first year back in the Premier League.
2009‚Äì10 season.
On August 5, 2009, the club announced that it was dropping the "Heat" from its name due to possible confusion with NBA franchise Miami Heat.
On August 7 the club signed the young high school phenom Jeremy Tyler from San Diego High School.
The club finished the regular season at 4th, but were eliminated by Elitzur Barak Netanya in the first round of the playoffs.
2010‚Äì11 season.
The team won a place in the Eurochallenge by beating the French team Paris. The club played an historic game against the NBA New Jersey Nets in front of 5,174 fans at the Prudential Center. Haifa trailed 56‚Äì43 at the break, but lost 108‚Äì70. In the Israel League Maccabi Haifa finished 9th after a season in which two coaches were fired (Elad Hasin and Ami Nawi).
2011‚Äì12 season.
Mickey Gorka who finished the last season with 6 home wins in a row signed with the team as head coach for a second season alongside his assistant Offer Rachimi. Sylven Landesberg, Tyler Wilkerson, Avi Ben Chimol and Jermaine Jackson also returned from last season and the team signed ex N.B.A players Sean Williams and Qyntel Woods. The team is the tallest team on average in the league ‚Äì 6-foot-5 (1.98 Meters) and one of the youngest ‚Äì 24.5 years-old. In November 2011, the team acquired a new main sponsor, the Oil Refineries LTD.(BAZAN) and is now called Maccabi Bazan Haifa.

Hopewell (Millville, West Virginia)

Hopewell, also known as Hopewell Mills and Hopewell Farm, was established around 1765 by William Little, Sr., who built grain and saw mills near the Shenandoah River. In 1827, William Little, Jr. sold the property to James Hite and Jacob Newcomer. Hite named the property "Hopewell", identifying the mill with a place in Leetown also named Hopewell, where there was a Quaker meeting house. Hite's descendant, Thomas Hite Willis, operated and expanded the mill, adding a woolen mill. The woolen mill operated until the 1920s providing uniforms for the Army. 
The complex includes a log-and-clapboard house, built "circa" 1765 with twentieth century additions, a tenant house (known as the "Viand Cottage") from the same era and of similar construction, several outbuildings and the ruins of the woolen mill, "circa" 1850.

Jacob B. Sweitzer

Jacob Bowman Sweitzer (July 4, 1821 ‚Äì November 9, 1888) was a Pennsylvania lawyer and soldier who commanded a regiment and then a brigade in the Army of the Potomac in the American Civil War. He and his men were significantly engaged at the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, where they reinforced and helped temporarily stabilize the Union defensive line on the second day of fighting.
Early life.
Jacob Bowman Sweitzer was born July 4, 1821, in Brownsville, Fayette County, PA. He was the son of Henry Sweitzer 1780-1852, and Ann Elliott Bowman 1790-1876. His Paternal ancestors were George Ludwig "Lewis" Sweitzer 1740-1795, and Conrad Sweitzer/Schweitzer 1706-1770, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1749, from Germany. His brother, Nelson Bowman Sweitzer, who became a career army officer, was born in Brownsville seven years later. Jacob Sweitzer studied at Jefferson College, graduating in 1843. 
He later studied law, passed the bar exam, and established a legal practice.
Civil War.
Sweitzer was named major of the 62nd Pennsylvania Infantry on July 4, 1861. He became lieutenant colonel on November 17 of that year and colonel on June 27, 1862. Sweitzer served in the Seven Days Battles, being wounded and captured at the Battle of Gaines Mill. After being exchanged on August 15, 1862, he led his regiment in the First Division, V Corps at the Second Battle of Bull Run and at Antietam in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin.
When Griffin became commander of the First Division, Sweitzer was temporarily his successor in brigade command, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Subsequently, Sweitzer returned to his regimental role. He resumed command of the brigade at the Battle of Chancellorsville, succeeding Col. James McQuade. (McQuade was senior to Sweitzer, but he had missed Fredericksburg.)
Gettysburg.
At the Battle of Gettysburg, the V Corps arrived early on July 2, 1863, after a hard march from Unionville, Maryland. The First Division, temporarily led by Brig. Gen. James Barnes, was sent to the left flank to aid III Corps. Sweitzer‚Äôs brigade and that of Col. William S. Tilton went into action between the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard. (The Third Brigade, under Col. Strong Vincent was detached and sent to Little Round Top.) The two brigades were deployed at a perpendicular angle to one another, which made their position hard to maintain under attack. After enduring Confederate assaults, General Barnes decided to withdraw from an exposed position. Sweitzer‚Äôs report describes the order to withdraw as ‚Äúperemptory.‚Äù 
Sweitzer‚Äôs command, however, was sent back into the fight, entering the Wheatfield. It was flanked, however, by Confederate Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford‚Äôs brigade, suffering serious losses. Col. Harrison Jeffords of the 4th Michigan Infantry was killed when Confederate soldiers tried to capture his regiment‚Äôs flag. The brigade withdrew toward Little Round Top and was positioned in that vicinity for the remainder of the battle. It later participated in the retreat of the Confederate army. Sweitzer had only three regiments present, one‚Äîthe 9th Massachusetts Regiment‚Äîbeing on detached duty. He reported that his regiments lost 466 out of 1,010 present on the field.
Sweitzer retained his brigade in the autumn of 1863, participating in the earlier stages of Bristoe Campaign and in the Mine Run Campaign.
After Gettysburg.
When the Army of the Potomac was reorganized preceding Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant‚Äôs Overland Campaign, Sweitzer retained brigade command in Griffin‚Äôs First Division. His brigade absorbed Tilton‚Äôs 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Sweitzer led the brigade at the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania. Sweitzer distinguished himself at the Battle of North Anna, holding the exposed right flank of V Corps during a Confederate attack near Jericho Mills. He also commanded these troops at the Battle of Cold Harbor and the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg.
Sweitzer was mustered out with his regiment on July 13, 1864. He received a brevet promotion to the rank of brigadier general for ‚Äúwar service‚Äù on March 13, 1865.
Postbellum activities.
After leaving the army, Sweitzer settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He resumed legal practice in Pittsburgh. Sweitzer died on November 9, 1888, and was buried at Allegheney Cemetery.

FlexOS

FlexOS was a modular real-time multi-user multi-tasking operating system (RTOS) designed for computer-integrated manufacturing, laboratory, retail and financial markets. It was developed by Digital Research's Flexible Automation Business Unit in Monterey, California since 1986 and was marketed since January 1987 as a derivation of Digital Research's Concurrent DOS 286 multiuser multitasking operating system.
Overview.
FlexOS was re-written in C for higher portability across hardware platforms, and it featured very low interrupt latency and fast context switching.
The original protected mode FlexOS 286 version 1.0 was designed for host machines equipped with 286 CPUs, and with adaptions for NEC V60, NEC V70 and Motorola 68000 processors planned. FlexOS 286 executables using the system's native INT DCh (INT 220) application program interface had the filename extension .286. A CP/M API front end (FE) was available as well, using the extension .CMD for executables. (A filename extension of .68K was reserved for FlexOS 68K, presumably derived from Concurrent DOS 68K as of 1986.)
In May 1987, FlexOS version 1.31 was released for 80286 machines. The developer version required an IBM PC/AT-compatible machine with 640¬†KB of conventional and 512¬†KB of extended memory, and either a (monochrome) CGA or an EGA graphics adapter.
FlexOS supported a concept of dynamically loadable and unloadable subdrivers, and it came with driver prototypes for floppies, hard disks, printers, serial interfaces, RAM disks, mice and console drivers.
During boot, the FLEX286.SYS kernel would load the resource managers and device drivers specified in the CONFIG.SYS "binary" file (not to be mixed up with the similarly named CONFIG.SYS configuration file under DOS), and its shell would execute a CONFIG.BAT startup batch job instead of the common AUTOEXEC.BAT.
FlexOS's optional DOS emulator provided limited PC DOS 2.1 compatibility for DOS .COM and .EXE programs. Certain restrictions applied since these programs were executed in the processor's protected mode. Due to bugs in earlier steppings of the Intel 80286, the FlexOS 286 DOS front-end required at least the 80286 E2 stepping to function properly. These problems had already caused delays in the delivery of Concurrent DOS 286 earlier.
The system optionally supported a multitasking GEM VDI for graphical applications.
FlexOS 1.31 could be linked with none, either or both of these two modules. FlexOS 1.31 also supported FlexNet.
By June 1987 there were also versions 1.0 of FlexOS 386 (for hosts) and FlexOS 186 (for remote cell controllers).
FlexOS 286 and FlexOS 386 versions 2.0 were registered on 3 July 1989.
Novell bought Digital Research in July 1991. 
X/GEM for FlexOS release 1.0 (aka X/GEM FlexOS 286 and 386) and FlexNet were registered on 21 December 1992.
FlexOS was used as the primary test platform for the new Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST).
When Novell decided to abandon further development of the various Digital Research operating systems such as Multiuser DOS (a successor to Concurrent DOS) and Novell DOS (a successor to DR DOS), they sold FlexOS off to the Santa Clara, California-based Integrated Systems, Inc. (ISI) for in July 1994. The deal comprised a direct payment of half this sum as well as shares representing 2% of the company. The company already had pSOS+, another modular real-time multitasking operating system for embedded systems, but they continued to maintain FlexOS as well. FlexOS version 2.33 was current as of May 1998 and with FlexOS 2.34 to be released soon after with added support for faster CPUs, 64 MB of memory, EIDE and ATAPI CDROM drives.
Integrated Systems was bought by their competitor Wind River Systems in 1999, who are owned by Intel since 2009.
Adaptations.
IBM 4680 OS.
Named IBM 4680 OS version 1, IBM originally chose DR Concurrent DOS 286 as the basis of their IBM 4680 computer for IBM Plant System products and Point-of-Sale terminals in 1986. The last release of the IBM 4680 OS has been version 4, before it was replaced by IBM 4690 version 1.
IBM 4690 OS.
In July 1993, IBM announced the adoption of FlexOS version 2.32 as the basis of their IBM 4690 OS version 1, to be pre-released on 24 September 1993 and generally made available from 25 March 1994. FlexOS 2.32 supported 286 and 386 modes, had more efficient memory management, better console and pipe systems, and brought overall quality and performance improvements compared to the version that came with IBM 4680 OS version 4. Further, it removed limits on the number of applications running concurrently due to its more efficient use of KOSPOOL.
In order to support Java IBM 4690 OS version 2 brought support for long filenames by means of a virtual filesystem (VFS) architecture and it introduced FAT32 volumes.
According to "The Year of the Store?", IHL Consulting Group/RIS News, IBM 4690 OS still had a market share of 12% in the POS register/client market in June 2005, when IBM was starting to phase it out in favour to IBM Retail Environment for SUSE (IRES).
IBM continues to maintain their 4690 OS up to the present, with the most recent version in April 2010 being IBM 4690 OS version 6.2.
Siemens S5-DOS/MT.
Siemens used and still maintains FlexOS in their factory automation equipment as well. For example, their Simatic S5 STEP-5 operating system S5-DOS/MT is based on FlexOS 386 with X/GEM, FlexNet and Btrieve, whereas the smaller S5-DOS system, also present on these systems, is a variant of Digital Research's Personal CP/M-86.

Ateneo‚ÄìLa Salle rivalry

The Ateneo‚ÄìLa Salle rivalry is a school rivalry between two universities in the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University. Both are private and Catholic academic institutions within the Metropolitan Manila area. The Ateneo Men's varsity team is known as Ateneo Blue Eagles, Women's varsity team as Lady Eagles, and high school team as Ateneo Blue Eaglets. The La Salle Men's varsity team is known as De La Salle Green Archers, Women's varsity team as Lady Archers, and high school team as Junior Archers.
History.
Ateneo and La Salle were co-founders of the NCAA but now compete in the UAAP. The seed for a future rivalry was planted after an Ateneo loss to La Salle in the championship game of NCAA season 16 (1939‚Äì40). Games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hotly contested but not yet tagged by the sportswriters as a rivalry since the recognized rivalry then was between Ateneo and San Beda. When Ateneo and La Salle transferred to the UAAP, they continued their hotly contested games and the sports press started to write about a rivalry. The basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle are currently the most anticipated in every UAAP season. These games draw huge crowds of students, school faculty/ officials, alums, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators and even a chief justice of the Supreme Court. Former presidents of the Philippines and ambassadors of the United States of America also attend the games. Both schools have extended their rivalry into the academic field and other sports.
From 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle were played at the open basketball courts in the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP and in 1926 at Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of Luneta Park). The venue later moved to the covered court of the US Army's 31st Infantry Gym and UST Gym. The games then moved to the Rizal Memorial Coliseum to accommodate bigger crowds, and at one point, the venues included the Loyola Center, Cuneta Astrodome, and PhilSports Arena. Currently, the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the SM Mall of Asia Arena are the main venues for the sold out games also seen on national television.
Head-to-head records by sport.
Seniors' Division.
As of November, 2013 the De La Salle Green Archers has more collegiate championships compared to Ateneo in the NCAA and UAAP combined. La Salle has 150 collegiate titles versus Ateneo Blue Eagles with 63 collegiate titles. La Salle also has 5 Overall (General) Collegiate Championships versus Ateneo with 1 Overall (General) Collegiate Championship. This count excludes additional collegiate titles and the 3 General Collegiate Championships also won by De La Salle-College of St. Benilde since it participated in the NCAA in 1998.

Collegiate Titles of National Scope.
In terms of collegiate titles of national scope, Ateneo leads 3 titles to 2. Ateneo won the Collegiate Champions League title in 2007, and won back to back the Philippine Collegiate Championship (PCC) in 2009 and 2010. La Salle won the Philippine Inter-collegiate title in 1988 and the Philippine Collegiate Championship in 2008 with La Salle winning over Ateneo.
Ateneo won the 2007 Collegiate Champions League title against the University of the Visayas Green Lancers, 71‚Äì54. The Collegiate Champions League (CCL), was then reformatted and became the Philippine Collegiate Championship (PCC). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during "March Madness."
La Salle's Green Archers won the 2008 PCC title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion San Beda Red Lions and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the Letran Knights in the final four. In the championship match, the De La Salle Green Archers prevailed over the Ateneo Blue Eagles, 71‚Äì62.
In the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16.
In the 2010 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-placed beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and 10 players intact in the line-up.
Ateneo has also won back-to-back titles in the annual University Games, winning in 2008 and 2009.
Championship Streaks.
Ateneo was 3-peat NCAA champion from 1931 through 1933, and its record of 14 collegiate titles remained unsurpassed by any school in the NCAA until 2003. They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012.
La Salle became the first school to be three-peat UAAP basketball champions in the both Men's and Women's division in 1999, 2000, and 2001.
Both schools have also managed to post what are regarded as "double championships" by winning both the seniors and juniors titles in the same year. The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with 4 double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).
Ateneo holds the distinction of being the only double three-peat champion in the Senior and Junior levels from 2008 to 2010 whether in the NCAA or the UAAP, and has posted two four-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors division.
After winning two championships in 1989 and 1990 in the UAAP, La Salle temporarily gained the upper hand, further dominating in the late 1990s through the turn of the millennium as 4-peat champion from 1998 to 2001.
La Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once and also posted a rare four-peat in UAAP men's basketball. The Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own in 2002. This is currently the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era.
La Salle, accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA and UAAP.
NCAA.
In 1939 La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship. A legend states that the rivalry reputedly started that year when after La Salle defeated Ateneo, then the defending champions, La Salle students threw fried chicken outside the gates of the old Ateneo campus in Manila. Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the championship again until 1958 where Ateneo defeated La Salle by a basket in overtime. Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship. Ateneo and La Salle left the NCAA in 1978 and 1981 respectively after games turned into full-blown riots, with Ateneo leaving after losing the 1978 championship against San Beda in closed doors, and La Salle after fan disturbance in their 1980 second-round game against Letran.
UAAP.
Ateneo completed a back-to-back in 1988 by prevailing over La Salle in the first head to head championship match up between the two schools. La Salle, on the other hand, won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped off the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. The two teams most recently met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, the Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school.
2001 Finals: Last of the Four-peat<br>
La Salle was the defending three-time champions, while Ateneo were in a 13-year championship drought; Ateneo started well, but La Salle had a relentless fourth quarter run, capped off by Manny Ramos' insurance free-throws to seal the game with 3.9 seconds left. At Game 2, Enrico Villanueva scored 22 points to lead the Eagles to a series-extending win. After Mike Cortez tying the game at 72‚Äìall, Villanueva passed the ball to teammate Magnum Membrere who scored a three-pointer, on the next possession, Ren-Ren Ritualo failed to answer with a game-tying three of his own to force a sudden-death Game 3, scoring Ateneo's first win against La Salle in the season after three games. In the deciding game, Carlo Sharma scored a UAAP career-high 22 points, 11 in the final quarter to prevent an Ateneo victory; Ateneo's rookie L.A. Tenorio had 30 points of his own, but it wasn't enough, as La Salle coach Pumaren remarking that "This was the sweetest of the four championships because we're able to erase the stigma of our 1988 loss to Ateneo."
2002 Finals: 14 year Ateneo championship drought is over<br>
Prior to the Finals, Ateneo prevented a 14‚Äì0 elimination round sweep of La Salle that would had given a bye up to the best-of-3 Finals. Instead, Ateneo defeated La Salle in the elimination round finale 76‚Äì63. La Salle defeated rival University of Santo Tomas (UST), and Ateneo overcame No. 2 seed University of the East (UE) in two games, with the second game ending in a buzzer beater by Gec Chia to push Ateneo into the Finals anew.
Game 1 ended with Villanueva scoring Ateneo's last ten points, and teammate Larry Fonacier blocking two shots by Mark Cardona that would've forced overtime to give Ateneo a 1‚Äì0 series lead. In Game 2, with the Ateneo team noted as being "tense," La Salle had an 18-point lead at halftime, which Ateneo cut down to three, 80‚Äì77, but Sharma and Adonis Santa Maria converted crucial free-throws that gave La Salle enough breathing space to force another Game 3. In Game 3, La Salle player Mike Cortez missed 11 of 13 shots, which caused La Salle students and alumni to accuse him of throwing the game, as Ateneo eventually won the title to deny La Salle a fifth-consecutive championship.
2003‚Äì2005: Semifinal meetings<br>
Ateneo and La Salle would play second fiddle to Far Eastern University (FEU) from 2003 to 2005, with the Tamaraws defeating Ateneo in 2003, losing to La Salle in 2004 and defeating La Salle in 2005.
Along the way, the two teams met in the semifinals, where the higher seed gets the "twice-to-beat advantage". In 2003, La Salle forced No. 1 seed Ateneo into a rubber match after a 76‚Äì72 overtime win, with the game being halted after a brawl erupted between the two teams. With Ateneo's LA Tenorio and La Salle's Ryan Ara√±a suspended for the deciding game, Ateneo eliminated La Salle from Finals contention in the deciding game with a 74‚Äì68 triumph.
In 2004, La Salle and Ateneo finished the elimination round tied for second place, so a playoff game was played to determine which team gets the twice-to-beat advantage. La Salle won the game, and ended Ateneo's season in the semifinals, to face FEU in the Finals. La Salle would win in three games to deny FEU which had defeated Ateneo a season before, a back-to-back championship run.
In 2005, three teams, La Salle, Ateneo and UE, were all tied for second place. La Salle won the tiebreaker with a superior point differential on games played by the three teams, causing Ateneo and UE to play for the right to face La Salle with the twice-to-win "disadvantage" in which the Eagles won. However, La Salle defeated Ateneo in the semifinals to clinch another Finals appearance against FEU.
2006: La Salle suspension<br>
After FEU swept La Salle in the 2005 championship series, La Salle admitted it fielded two ineligible players from 2003 to 2005, albeit it claimed not to be aware of their ineligibility which caused them to return the 2005 runner-up trophy and the 2004 championship trophy they won against FEU (The league would later award FEU the trophy). The league suspended La Salle in 2006 for a year due to negligence, with all of their games during that period also forfeited. Ateneo faced UST in the 2006 Finals, a series UST won in three games.
2007: "Two is greater than three"<br>
Upon their return in 2007, UE swept the elimination round 14‚Äì0, with their last game against La Salle going into overtime with the Warriors still prevailing. With Ateneo also losing their last game, the two teams were again tied for second place, and La Salle won the playoff game to clinch the twice-to-beat advantage. Prior to this, Ateneo won the two elimination round games against La Salle.
Unlike earlier match-ups where the team with the advantage won the first game, Ateneo won the first game, with Chris Tiu playing pivotal roles in crunch time where he scored the winning lay-up with 7.3 seconds remaining to force a deciding game. In their fifth meeting of the season, Pocholo Villanueva scored a three-pointer to add La Salle's lead to nine with less than three minutes in the game left. After an Ateneo 6‚Äì2 run, Villanueva scored a jump-shot anew, padding the lead to seven. After Ford Arao later cut the lead to five, La Salle's OJ Cua missed two free-throws with 23.9 seconds remaining. Chris Tiu passed the ball to Nonoy Baclao who scored a three-pointer to cut the lead to two, but JV Casio converted both of his free-throws with 4 seconds left to punch La Salle's ticket to the Finals. This had been the only time Ateneo and La Salle played for five games in a season without both the teams advancing to the Finals.
La Salle would eventually sweep UE in the Finals 2‚Äì0 to cap their seventh men's basketball championship. After the season, La Salle coach Franz Pumaren remarked that "This is the only time that two is greater than three, they beat us three times, but we beat them when it counted the most."
2008 Finals: Double Championship<br>
Ateneo would later claim their fourth UAAP title in 2008 against defending champions La Salle by sweeping the finals series 2‚Äì0. In Game 1, Rabeh Al-Hussaini scored 31 points to lead Ateneo to a win. In Game 2, Ateneo led by 15 points at halftime, but La Salle came back cutting the lead to three, 50‚Äì47 at the end of the third quarter. However, La Salle forward Rico Maierhofer was ejected just before the end of the third after the officials said that he flashed the dirty finger, although Maierhofer denied the charge. A La Salle scoring drought saw the lead balloon to eight in the last two minutes, and Ateneo never looked back after a Jai Reyes three-point play to secure Ateneo's fourth UAAP men's basketball title.
2009‚Äì12: Ateneo championships<br>
La Salle paraded several rookies for the 2009 season, while Ateneo emerged with only Chris Tiu as the major graduating player. With these conditions, the first Ateneo‚ÄìLa Salle game came at the heels of former President Corazon Aquino's death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.
In 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66‚Äì63, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007. In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4‚Äì9, the Blue Eagles went on a 10‚Äì0 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74‚Äì57.
2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.
In 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo was the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.
Prior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, facing UST in the finals.
2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo<br>
Upon the departure of Norman Black, Dolreich "Bo" Perasol, a former member of the University of the Philippines men's basketball team and a seasoned Philippine Basketball Association head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.
Over at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013-2014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.
For the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82-73, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66-64, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.
Toward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the UST Growling Tigers.
Ateneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74-82, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.
La Salle, after a disastrous 3-4 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10-4, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the NU Bulldogs and the FEU Tamaraws. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since UAAP Season 71.
During the Finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the UAAP Season 76 Men's Basketball Championship title.
Juniors' basketball rivalry.
The two universities are also represented in the high school level, with the Ateneo de Manila High School and La Salle Green Hills (1968‚Äì1981), De La Salle Zobel (1986‚Äìpresent). And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When La Salle Green Hills used to be the Juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the Ateneo High School and the LSGH High School are both all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School, the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.
In Juniors basketball, the Ateneo has 9 NCAA titles and 17 UAAP titles, for a total of 26, whereas La Salle has 5 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 7 total.
La Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Ateneo Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship. Ateneo High School and De La Salle Santiago Zobel School (DLSZ) met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in 2007 in which DLSZ won in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in 2009 in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2‚Äì1. In addition, the Junior Archers weren't able to defend their 2005 championship due to their suspension along with their seniors' counterparts.

For the De La Salle Zobel Men's football team; they have maintained 5 years of high school football championships in the RIFA cup 1 and 2 where Ateneo was not successful in winning any match against De La Salle Zobel which totaled 9 championship titles from 2001 to 2005. From 2001 to 2005, De La Salle Zobel were RIFA 1 and 2 champions 9 times, most of them back to back champions in every year. The only loss La Salle Zobel encountered was a loss to Xavier high school during the RIFA 2 championship in 2004.

It took 13 years before Ateneo could beat La Salle when in 2004, Johnel Clemente's game-winning RBI single off La Salle pitcher Angel Gabriel nailed Ateneo's victory, 9‚Äì8. In 2006, Ateneo handed La Salle its first humiliating 10-run loss, 17‚Äì7, on Jonathan Sibal's 2-RBI single off pitcher Jeff Ardio which ended the game prematurely at the 8th inning (mercy rule).

The games were played consistently from 1986 until 2006 when La Salle was suspended for fielding two ineligible players.
Official UAAP league records since 1986 show that head to head championships between the teams have Ateneo leading 3 championships to 1. Including regular season, Final Four and Championship games in the UAAP, Ateneo leads 42 games to 29 as seven La Salle wins from 2003 to 2005 were forfeited due to the use of ineligible players using falsified documents. 
Trivia.
Due to many socialites watching the games live, La Salle head coach Franz Pumaren said that "The janitors in Araneta always say, 'If there's an Ateneo-La Salle game, once everybody's out of the coliseum, it still smells good because of the all the socialites watching.' " In the late 1990s, former first daughter and actress Kris Aquino would call Ateneo head coach Joe Lipa to check on the team's progress, according to Ricky Dandan, Lipa's former assistant and brother of former NU Bulldogs coach Manny. Joel Banal, Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to 2003, used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded press, and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills.
Furthermore, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the 2000 NBA All-Star Game to the Moro Lorenzo Sports Center, while shipping magnate Enrique Razon, Jr. donated about US$1 million to refurbish La Salle's sporting facilities.
During the collegiate games between both schools, notably basketball, televised coverage would occasionally flash famous alumni from entertainment, politics, business, education, and other fields watching from the sidelines. Former Ateneo cheerleader and current Senator Richard Gordon is renowned for sideline antics like jumping on the scorer's table to rile up the crowd. Gary Valenciano entertained the crowds during the recent UAAP 73 opening ceremonies.
Orlando Magic player Gilbert Arenas described the Ateneo-La Salle game as "you split the crowd in half, 50‚Äì50. One side of their gym was blue and one side of their gym was green and everybody was just yelling."

1CMS

FM 91.1 CMS (callsign 1CMS) is a multilingual community radio station broadcasting to Canberra in languages other than English from studios in the suburb of Holder. CMS is a member of the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters Council (NEMBC) and the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA).
The policy of CMS is to encourage all languages to broadcast for at least an hour each week, providing time on an equitable basis. Programming priorities include youth, women and emerging communities.
History.
The EBC (Ethnic Broadcasters Council) as it was then called, started broadcasting by purchasing airtime on community station 2XX. Up to 25 language groups were broadcasting for half an hour each per week during the 1980s. Discontent in the early 1990s saw the EBC and 2XX sever ties with each other. EBC were off the air until August 1992 when they were able to apply for their own test broadcast licence. EBC were back on air on Tuesdays and Fridays using the facilities of ArtSound FM.
In 1999 the EBC received a full-time test licence to broadcast on 103.5 FM. Soon after the on air identity was changed to "Canberra Multicultural Service" and the frequency moved to the present 91.1 FM. Then an application for a full broadcasting licence was applied for. This was granted on June 15, 2001.
Current.
FM 91.1 CMS now has programming in around 30 languages. The station broadcasts live from the "Canberra Multicultural Festival" each year. Internet streaming was introduced in 2008.
Programming.
As of 2008, the station broadcasts in the following languages:
Satellite programming from Deutsche Welle, Radio France International and the National Indigenous Radio Service is also carried.

Baldwin de Boulers

Baldwin de Boulers came to England in 1105 when he was granted the Lordship of Montgomery, Powys in marriage with Sybil de Falaise. Sybil was referred to as the niece of Henry I of England but is commonly believed, probably incorrectly, to be one of his illegitimate children. 
Baldwin was of a Flemish family from Boelare and his father was Stephen, Baron de Boelare. Boelare is now known as NederBoelare and is part of the town of Geraardsbergen, East Flanders, Belgium.
The de Boulers were based at Hen Domen, the original site for Montgomery Castle and it is from Baldwin that Montgomery gets its Welsh name, Trefaldwyn "The Town of Baldwin".
The de Boulers continued as a prominent Shropshire family, becoming the Bowdlers.

<doc id="18364865" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18364865" title="Ch√¢teau de Janvry">
Ch√¢teau de Janvry

The Ch√¢teau de Janvry is a stately home in the French village of Janvry, Essonne.
The ch√¢teau dates back to the 17th century. It is still partially surrounded by watered moats. Its main building includes a primary wing facing west and two attached side wings; the north wing and the south wing. All wings are linked, creating a U-shaped ch√¢teau. The ch√¢teau has been listed as an historical monument by the Demeure Historique Association in the early 1980s.
History.
The ch√¢teau was built around 1600 and 1650 in the Louis XIII architectural style. It has been part of the Reille family for many centuries. The ch√¢teau has always been transmitted from generation to generation by the women of the family. Therefore, each succession brought a new last name as the domain‚Äôs owner. The families of Anjoran and Reille are amongst the families who inherited the ch√¢teau. Unfortunately, during the French Revolution of 1789, the ch√¢teau was robbed, resulting in the family losing all of their older documents regarding the ch√¢teau, its domain and history. Since the mid-19th century, the ch√¢teau has been used as a secondary residence by the family. The monument located at the village entrance was built, following the death of Elisabeth Anjoran, who died while giving birth in 1847.
The Baron Jean Victor Reille inherited the domain during World War II. As the ch√¢teau had been unoccupied by the Reille family during the war, the German, English and the French troops successfully lodged in the ch√¢teau. Local inhabitants witnessed the degradation of the property made by some of the French troops, unlike the Germans or the English who took care of the domain. Some soldiers extracted wood panels from the original 17th century hardwood floors to use as fuel for the master living room chimney during the harsh winter months. Today, traces of the new and replaced wooden panels can be seen in some parts of the formal living rooms. Also, in a bedroom on the second floor of the North West tower, some inscriptions and writings on the walls can be found, witnessing the occupancy by French soldiers.
When Baron Jean Reille arrived to the ch√¢teau returning from the war, nettles were growing in some of the rooms of the house. Over the next few years following the end of the Second World, he and his wife Liliane successfully gave the ch√¢teau back its ancient splendor by installing a new roof, adding modern plumbing and electricity, also remodeling the interior of the house. His son, the Baron Ghislain Reille, pursued this laborious work when he took responsibility over the house in the 1980s. The ch√¢teau is now a modern property where many renovations have been made within the original style and charm of the Louis XIII-style chateau.
Over recent years, multiple movie and television production companies intended to use the ch√¢teau for production needs, but the only time the ch√¢teau has ever been open to the public is in 1995 for a fireworks show.
Tourism.
Visitors access the main building using a bridge over passing the moats, passing through a very large wrought iron portal which leads to the formal courtyard (‚ÄòCour d‚ÄôHonneur‚Äô). The portal key weights around 1 kilo (two pounds) and measures up to 30 centimeters (12¬†inches) long. Leading to the ch√¢teau from the fields to the west is a alley, bordered with poplars (‚Äòl‚ÄôAllee des Peupliers‚Äô). This alley was the original ch√¢teau‚Äôs entrance, and is now covered with maintained grass as a paved village street which crosses the alley along the moats, separating the alley from the ch√¢teau, creating an easy access for visitors and owners.
The Cour d‚ÄôHonneur is a large 50 by 50 meter courtyard covered with white gravel. It is surrounded by grassy areas and plants separating the courtyard in symmetric areas, giving a perspective view of the main building to the arriving visitor.
The main building follows a Louis XIII architectural style. Following this architecture trends, the ch√¢teau shows a very typical dissymmetry, unique to the Louis XIII style. The west side of the main building has 4 windows left to the main entrance, and 3 on the right side. Similarly, on the East side of the building (facing the private park), 5 windows can be found on the right of the entrance door, and 4 can be found on the left side.
The Main Building.
Central part of the ch√¢teau (the West wing), includes the master living room, dining room, billiard and ch√¢teau‚Äôs formal entryway. All rooms have windows facing east and west. These rooms get natural daylight from the sunrise over the park to sunset over the fields and the poplar alley. The second floor includes a long corridor leading to multiple bedroom suites overlooking the private park and garden.
The first floor of the north wing has originally been designed to store stagecoaches for lords or visitors. Since then, the arches (where the stagecoaches were stored) have been filled, but are still easily visible.
The south wing faces the small courtyard and is a fully functional home with its own private entrance, kitchen and large living/dining room on the first floor. The second floor is accessible through private staircases. 4 bedrooms and a bathroom can be found on the second floor. The south wing was originally intended for the staff‚Äôs use. The entrance of this wing used to be the fruit cellar; a separate apartment on the first floor. The kitchen was a bedroom, and the current living/dining room was a small studio. The second floor rooms were accessible through the staircases found on the southern part of the West wing.
The Small Courtyard.
This courtyard is surrounded by barns and granaries forming a closed square where poultry, cattle and other farm animals used to be raised. All barns still have many traces of past activities. In one cowshed, some cows‚Äô names can be seen (the stable is still functional and can house up to 4 horses). The attics above the barns are sumptuous with their vaulted ceilings and large oak beams from the local forests. One barn (in particular) has ceilings soaring 15‚Äì20 yards high. They were used to store cereals and grains. One of the barns leads to the south-western part of the tower, where 4 jail cells can still be found. In order to preserve its authenticity, no-one ever renovated these cells. Only a small and inaccessible fanlight gives air and light to the room. Two of the 4 jail doors are still present. It has been confirmed that these jail cells were being used during World War II, for war prisoners.
The Cellar.
The cellar runs under the entire west and north wings. The vaulted cellar has been used to store food and wine for many years. The cider and apple liquor produced in the ch√¢teau were stored there to mature.
The well.
Although the well is filled with rain water, it is still functional and filled each winter with water running down from the gutters.
The Park.
The ch√¢teau is surrounded by a 14 hectare (34.5 acres) park. The park offers complete privacy, and is surrounded by stone walls (except from a small section wire netted). The park includes 10 hectares of forest with large alleys for leisurely strolls (more than two hectares of grassy area, half of which is mowed lawn). A one hectare lake and a tennis court are also located in the park. The park is accessible to modern vehicles through the small courtyard. There are also two portals located on the east and north walls.
The park includes a high density of medium to small trees with primarily large oaks (some of which will reach maturity in a few years). Those multi-century old oaks stand all across the park. according to experts, the oldest oak aged more than 300 years old. The park has been designed over the centuries to include many tree species: oaks, beeches (including the red beech alley), elms, hazel and chestnut trees.
To the north of the ch√¢teau is a large orchard with various fruit trees and an organic vegetable garden that is maintained all year-long. chicken coops and other small farm animals (geese, etc.) are also in this garden.
The ch√¢teau‚Äôs icebox, where ice brought by horses were stored under the oak trees‚Äô coolness, can be found close to the east portal. This icebox has long been used by the ch√¢teau‚Äôs staff.
A legend says that the nearby ch√¢teau called the Ch√¢teau de Saint Jean de Beauregard and a monastery (now disappeared) located in the Arpajon forest were linked through a network of subterranean tunnels. Those tunnels were built to allow the owners to escape in the event of dangers. Traces of those tunnels are clearly visible in the park, but no confirmation has been given to the tunnel‚Äôs destination or length as of today.
The Domain.
Surrounding the village, the ch√¢teau and its park (mostly centered to the northern part of the ch√¢teau), the domain includes 65 hectares (160 acres) of farming fields and 105 hectares (260 acres) of forest.
Location.
The Ch√¢teau de Janvry is located from the center of Paris. Easily accessible by road, Janvry is located 30 minutes from the Orly airport or 15 minutes from the Toussus-le-Noble airport. A 10-minute helicopter ride will take visitors from Paris to the ch√¢teau.
Activities.
Today, the Ch√¢teau de Janvry often featured in motion picture movies, magazines and photo shoots. Also it is rented for private parties and hunting: small game (pheasants, partridges and duck) and big game (roe deer, deer, boar) hunts.

In 1989 the CPN, PSP and PPR participated, under the name "The Rainbow". In the same year those three parties together with the progressive Christian EVP formed the GreenLeft political party.

Between 1984 and 1994 the some of MEPs were formally required to rotate. That is the top candidate and chair sat the entire term, while the second candidate on the list (in both the 1984 and the 1989 elections the combined list won two seats) was required to give up his seat in order to make room for the third candidate on the list. This was meant to give all participating parties (CPN, PSP and PPR) an MEP for a certain period. In 1987 the PPR MEP Verbeek gave up his seat for the CPN candidate Van Dijk. In 1991 PPR MEP Verbeek refused to give up his seat, which would have been taken by the PSP-member Hontelez.

Five Mile House railway station

Five Mile House was a railway station on the Lincolnshire Loop Line which served the village of Fiskerton in Lincolnshire between 1848 and 1964. Situated on the south bank of the River Witham, passengers on the north bank had to use a ferry to reach it. It closed two years after opening due to low traffic, but reopened fifteen years later. Withdrawal of passenger services took place in 1958, leaving the station open for anglers' excursions until 1964. The Water Rail Way footpath now runs through the site.
History.
The station was opened on 17 October 1848 on the south bank of the River Witham near the village of Fiskerton. It was constructed by Peto and Betts civil engineering contractors who, in November 1846, had agreed to construct the line including stations by 28 February 1848. It took its name from a public house near the river which served as a barge inn popular with horse-drawn packets. Two timber-built staggered platforms were provided either side of a crossing which led to a ferry across the river. Users on the north bank of the river were obliged to cross it using the ferry to reach the station, a journey which deterred many potential customers. Lack of traffic resulted in the station closing in 1850, only to reopen fifteen years later when a farmer was granted siding facilities. A footbridge replaced the ferry in 1957 when the latter closed.
Goods traffic was never heavy, and the station was mainly used for transporting potatoes, grain, hay and sugar beet. The station buildings were destroyed by fire in 1919 and were replaced by two small buildings; one was used as an office and the other as a waiting room. The July 1927 timetable saw seven up and five down services, and one Sunday service each way; destinations included , , , , and . Regular passenger services were withdrawn on 15 September 1958, but the station remained open until 6 September 1964 for anglers' specials on summer weekends from and to , and . By September 1964, only one train each way called at the station.
Present day.
The timber platforms remained intact until at least the early 1970s. The Water Rail Way footpath now runs through the site.

Houlihan Smith &amp; Company

Houlihan Smith & Company is an investment banking firm that provides financial advisory and financing services to public and private businesses. Houlihan, founded in 1996, is a provider of financial opinions, merger and acquisitions advisory, financing, and other corporate advisory services. Houlihan Smith is a broker-dealer and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The firm is not affiliated with any financial or investment institutions and does not have referral or financial arrangements with other brokers or dealers. It is authorized to do business in 8 states CA, FL, IL, IA, MN, NV, NY, WA. Houlihan employs approximately 125 professionals with offices in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. In 2006, the firm also implemented an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Houlihan Smith & Company is now closed.
History.
Houlihan Smith & Company was established in 1996 by Richard Alfred Houlihan (former chairman of Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Inc.) and mergers and acquisitions advisor Andrew David Smith. The two met in the early 1990s while Mr. Smith was employed with Kemper Securities (now part of Wachovia Bank) and together they sold a software company where Mr. Houlihan was chairman. The two partners formed Houlihan Smith as a multi-service investment bank with strong underpinnings in the fields of complex business valuation and M&A deal-making.
The firm‚Äôs largest financial opinion was a solvency opinion provided to Reliant Energy, with its $12 billion financial restructuring. Since then, Houlihan Smith has performed more than 400 valuations and financial opinions each year. Houlihan and Smith each own 25-50% of the firm, while Charles Botchway owns 10-25% of the firm.
The increased pressure and scrutiny placed on boards of directors, special committees and key executives led Houlihan to offer fiduciary guidance for its clients through the Houlihan Smith Compendia Series, a compilation of case law that highlights actions and judgments where fiduciaries breached their duty of care and duty of loyalty. The Fairness Compendium and the Solvency Compendium communicate the stringent guidelines that fiduciaries must follow, including the business judgment rule, and the more prevalent Entire Fairness Standard. Under the Entire Fairness Standard, where a transaction involves a conflict of interest and has been contested by minority shareholders, directors bear the burden of proving the entire fairness of the transaction. Many directors and fiduciaries must take considerable measures to ensure that actions and judgment shift the burden of proof to shareholders. A common measure taken is the formation of an independent and disinterested special committee to oversee and negotiate the transaction process.
During the mid-2000s, Houlihan Smith extended its services into portfolio valuation, complex derivatives valuation and investment advisory for hedge funds, private equity groups and other alternative investment groups. A recent accounting pronouncement, Financial Accounting Standard No. 157 (FAS 157): Fair Value Measurements, has mandated the quarterly and annual reporting of fair value for companies and investment firms. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy is composed of the following observable inputs: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 Inputs are typically hard-to-value, illiquid securities that require the use of an independent valuation advisor to opine on the value of these securities.

When the Taiping Rebellion army occupied Nanjing in 19 March, Lu Jianying was killed by the Taiping army. Lu was the second to be killed (the first was the Viceroy of HuGuang in early 1853) and a few of the highest rank governors killed in action in the Qing Dynasty. When Beijing knew of Lu's death and the loss of Nanjing, they chose to impeach Lu in order to place the blame on him, saying he was incapable of commanding the battle.

Pierre Beuffeuil (L'Eguill√©, France, 30 October 1934) is a former French professional road bicycle racer. He won a stage of the Tour de France after the rest of the field had stopped to greet Charles de Gaulle, the president.
Tour de France.
Pierre Beuffeuil was riding the Tour de France in 1960 for the regional Centre-Midi team when news came that Charles de Gaulle, the president, would be by the route at Colombey-les-deux-√âglises, where he lived. The organisers, Jacques Goddet and F√©lix L√©vitan asked the national champion, Henry Anglade, if the riders would be willing to stop. Anglade agreed and the news was spread through the race.
Beuffeuil, however, had stopped to repair a tyre and knew nothing of the plan. He was three minutes behind the race. He reached Colombey convinced he would still be behind the race when it finished in Troyes, then found the race halted in front of him. He pressed on alone, now leading rather than following, and won the stage alone on the boulevard Jules-Guesde by 49 seconds.
"I voted for de Gaulle", he said.
Beuffeuil won the stage from Montlu√ßon to Orl√©ans in 1966 after a break of 204¬†km. He came third in the Four Days of Dunkirk in 1961 and again in 1966.

Judge Lopez

Judge Lopez is a character in the epic Judge Dredd story, "The Judge Child", which originally appeared in the British science fiction anthology comic "2000 AD" issues 156‚Äì181, in 1980.
Publication history.
The character of Lopez was created by writer John Wagner under the pseudonym John Howard, and was first drawn by Brian Bolland. He was also drawn by Ron Smith and Mike McMahon, albeit in the latter's case in just one frame when he appears on a monitor screen. Later McMahon included Lopez along with the other Judges on the cover of the first volume of a three-volume reprint of the Judge Child story for Titan Books.
Fictional character biography.
Previously unseen in the comic, Lopez was assigned to assist Dredd along with Judge Hershey and pilot Judge Larter in his quest for the mysterious Judge Child. However Dredd takes an irrational dislike to Lopez for no other reason than the fact that he has a moustache. Recording entries in his log, Dredd reveals himself to be petty-minded regarding the presence of facial hair on the face of an officer of the law, contrasting being a Judge with being in a beauty contest. Claiming that Lopez is "proving difficult re moutache", Dredd's reaction is to deny him involvement in the team's investigations on the planets they visit, leaving him aboard the craft to carry out menial tasks the robots would usually perform. Hershey advises Lopez to shave off his moustache to prevent further discrimination, but Lopez naively asserts that since he is not breaking any regulations Dredd has no valid reason to single him out.
The conflict between the two Judges reaches critical point when Dredd has Lopez strapped down and makes him take a dangerous hallucinogenic drug called Oracle Spice in the name of the mission. The drug will enable the taker to learn the location of the Judge Child. Dredd refuses to take the drug itself, claiming that Lopez's personality profile shows him to be "the most unstable member of the crew - the most receptive to information from the oracle spice". A single drop has an instant effect causing Lopez's vision to be twisted seeing the other Judge's faces stretched like rubber, a moment which was also captured memorably on the front cover of 2000AD issue 172. Lopez's hallucinations include seeing his own coffin being ejected from the space-ship and himself being devoured by a gigantic toad. He also sees a moustached toad whose back is covered with gravestones which informs him that payment for the information he seeks will be Lopez's own life. Later Lopez does indeed die, prompting Hershey to cry while Dredd coldly remarks "he knew the risks and he accepted them. Try to follow his example, Hershey".
When the Judge Child proves to be corrupt and cruel rather than the supposed saviour of Mega-City One, Dredd's quest ends in failure, and Lopez's sacrifice is proved therefore to have been vain.
When his body is committed to space, Dredd writes in his log "Every Judge must be prepared to give his life for the city. When his moment came, Lopez was not found wanting. He will be remembered". Judge Lopez gave his life to a hypocritical and unsympathetic system of rule and despite Dredd's comments he has never been remembered by either the Judges or the citizens of Mega-City One for whom he gave his life. Only Dredd himself seems to have reflected on the sacrifice later: In a story published in issue 1280 (in 2002), it was revealed that Dredd kept Lopez's badge to remind him of his responsibility for Lopez's death, and that Dredd regrets not taking the fatal Oracle Spice himself.

Beginning in the fall of 2008 the station also started airing the ‚ÄúCross Town Classic‚Äù between Murray High School and Calloway County High School. 
In 2008 the station became even more involved in the local communities by launching Froggyland Sports. The site offers an in depth look at high school sports in much of the broadcast air, known as ‚ÄúFroggyland‚Äù. Froggyland Sports is updated by Travis Turner who hosts his sports talk show on brother station WOFC-AM ESPN The Office. WFGS, WNBS, & WOFC all act as the "voice" of Murray High School Sports and Calloway County Basketball. Games are aired on all three stations as well as on the internet at Froggylandsports.Com.
History.
The station went on the air as WAAW in 1977, owned by Murray Broadcasting Company. Its format was album oriented rock. In 1988, the station was sold to Jackson Purchase Broadcasting, which changed the call to WBLN ("The Blend") and made the format adult contemporary. After being sold to Forever Communications, 103.7 became a country station with the call sign WFGE on 1997-03-17. In July 2008, the owner elected to move the Murray station's call sign to another station with the Froggy branding based in Pennsylvania. The old WFGE then became WFGS.

McLaughlin group (mathematics)

In the mathematical group theory, the McLaughlin group McL is a sporadic simple group of order 27 ¬∑ 36 ¬∑ 53¬∑ 7 ¬∑ 11 = 898,128,000, discovered by as an index 2 subgroup of a rank 3 permutation group acting on the McLaughlin graph with 275 =1+112+162 vertices. It fixes a 2-2-3 triangle in the Leech lattice so is a subgroup of the Conway groups.
Its Schur multiplier has order 3, and its outer automorphism group has order 2. The group 3.McL.2 is a maximal subgroup of the Lyons group.
McL has one conjugacy class of involution (element of order 2), whose centralizer is a maximal subgroup of type 2.A8. This has a center of order 2; the quotient modulo the center is isomorphic to the alternating group A8.
Representations.
In the Conway group Co3, McL has the normalizer McL:2, which is maximal in Co3.
McL is the only sporadic group to admit irreducible representations of quaternionic type. It has 2 such representations, one of dimension 3520 and one of dimension 4752.
Generalized Monstrous Moonshine.
Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For the Conway groups, the relevant McKay-Thompson series is formula_1 and formula_2.
Let formula_3 = 1, 23, 253, 253, 275, 896, 896, 1771, 2024...() and formula_4 = 1, 22, 231, 252, 770, 770, 896, 896...() be the degrees of irreducible representations of "Co"3 and "McL", respectively. Then,

St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Brooklyn, New York)

__notoc__
St. Paul's Episcopal Church of Brooklyn at 423 Clinton Street at Carroll Street in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City was built from 1867 to 1884 and was designed by Richard Upjohn & Son in the High Victorian Gothic style. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
The parish is part of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America in the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, part of the worldwide Anglican Communion, in the Anglo-Catholic tradition.
Parish history.
St. Paul's was founded on Christmas Day of 1849, in South Brooklyn, then the quickly developing southward expansion of old Brooklyn Heights. New homes and businesses were covering old countryside, farmland, and shoreline; industrialization was bringing a new way of life to the City of Brooklyn, waves of immigrants from the nations of the world were arriving and the American Civil War was looming. This was also the era when the Anglican Communion of Churches was experiencing a renewed vision of their catholic faith and order often called the "Anglo-Catholic Revival" of the Oxford Movement. Saint Paul's was formed in heady days of philosophical, social, economic, and religious change.

War of the Portuguese Succession

The War of the Portuguese Succession was fought from 1580 to 1583 between the two main claimants to the Portuguese throne: Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato, proclaimed in several towns as King of Portugal, and Philip II of Spain, who eventually succeeded in claiming the crown, reigning as Philip I of Portugal.
The Cardinal-King.
The Cardinal Henry, great-uncle of Sebastian I of Portugal, became ruler in the immediate wake of Sebastian's death. Henry had served as regent for Sebastian after 1557, and succeeded him as King after the disastrous Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir in 1578. Henry renounced his clerical offices and sought to take a bride for the continuation of the Aviz dynasty, but Pope Gregory XIII, affiliated with the Habsburgs, did not release him from his vows. The Cardinal-King died two years later, without having appointed a Council of Regency to choose a successor.
Claimants to the throne.
Portuguese nobility was worried about the maintenance of their independence and sought help to find a new King. By this time the Portuguese throne was disputed by several claimants; among them were Catherine, Duchess of Braganza (1540‚Äì1614), her nephew Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma, Philip II of Spain and Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato. The Duchess was later acknowledged by the Habsburgs as the legitimate heir, after her descendants obtained the throne in 1640 (in the person of John IV of Portugal), but at that time, she was only one of several possible heirs. According to the feudal custom, her late older sister's son Rainuccio, an Italian, was the closest heir, then the Duchess herself, and only after them, King Philip. Philip II of Spain was a foreigner (although his mother was Portuguese) and descended from Manuel I by a female line; as for Ant√≥nio, although he was Manuel I's grandson in the male line, he was an illegitimate grandson.
Ranuccio Farnese (1569‚Äì1622), the hereditary Duke of Parma and Piacenza, was the son of the late elder daughter of Duarte of Portugal, Duke of Guimar√£es, the only son of Manuel I whose legitimate descendants survived at that time, Ranuccio was according to the feudal custom the first heir to the throne of Portugal. He was the son of Don Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza and of Maria of Portugal. His great-uncle Henry I of Portugal's death triggered the struggle for the throne of Portugal when Ranuccio was 11 years old. However, his father was an ally and even a subject of the Spanish King, another contender, so Ranuccio's rights were not very forcibly claimed at that time. Ranuccio became reigning Duke of Parma in 1592.
Instead, Ranuccio's mother's younger sister Catherine, Duchess of Braganza, claimed the throne, very ambitiously, but failed. Catherine, Duchess of Braganza was married to Duke John I of Braganza (descendant in male line from Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza, an illegitimate son of John I of Portugal), who himself was grandson of the late Duke James of Braganza, also a legitimate heir of Portugal, being the son of infanta Isabella of Portugal, sister of Manuel I and daughter of infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu, second son of King Duarte I. The Duchess also had a son, Dom Teod√≥sio of Braganza, who would be her royal heir and successor to the throne. The Duchess's claim was relatively strong, as it was reinforced by her husband's position as one of the legitimate heirs; thus they would both be entitled to hold the Kingship. Moreover, the Duchess was living in Portugal, not abroad, and was not underage, but 40 years old. Her weaknesses were her gender (Portugal had not had a generally recognized reigning queen) and her being the second daughter, there thus existed a genealogically senior claimant.
According to the old feudal custom, the line of succession of the Portuguese throne would have been:
Succession.
Both Ant√≥nio and Philip were the grandchildren of King Manuel I of Portugal :
War.
On July 24, 1580, Ant√≥nio proclaimed himself as King of Portugal and of the Algarves, in Santar√©m, which was followed by popular acclamation in several locations of the country. However, he governed in Continental Portugal for only 33 days, culminating in his defeat at the Battle of Alc√¢ntara by the Spanish armies led by Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba on August 25. The Battle ended in a decisive victory for the Spanish Habsburgs, both on land and sea. Two days later, the Duke of Alba captured Lisbon.
In early 1581, Ant√≥nio fled to France and, as Philip‚Äôs armies had not yet occupied the Azores, he sailed there with a number of French adventurers under Filippo Strozzi, a Florentine exile in the service of France, but was utterly defeated at sea by a combined Spanish-Portuguese navy commanded by Don √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz at the Battle of Ponta Delgada off Terceira Island on July 26, 1582 and off S√£o Miguel Island on July 27, 1582.
Ant√≥nio still accompanied an English Expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys, to the coasts of Spain and Portugal but the Expedition failed and Ant√≥nio's attempt to rule Portugal from Terceira Island, in the Azores (where he even minted coins) came to an end in 1583.
Consequences.
The combined Spanish-Portuguese navy's victory resulted in the rapid Spanish conquest of the Azores, completing the union of the Portuguese and Spanish empires. The King Philip II of Spain was recognized as King Philip I of Portugal and of the Algarves by the Portuguese Cortes of Tomar (1581). Spain and Portugal would remain united in a personal union of the crowns (remaining formally independent and with autonomous administrations) for the next 60 years, until 1640. This period is called the Iberian Union.

Inside Dave Van Ronk (compilation)

Inside Dave Van Ronk is a compilation album by American folk and blues singer Dave Van Ronk, originally released in 1972 on a double LP called "Van Ronk". It has subsequently been reissued on CD, the first reissue in 1989.
The songs in the compilation consist of the '60s Prestige albums "Dave Van Ronk, Folksinger" and "Inside Dave Van Ronk" in their entirety.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the album "... this is certainly Van Ronk's most enduring work, and indeed one of the few relics of the early-'60s traditional folk boom that holds up well today... One of the few white folkies who could sing acoustic blues without embarrassment, Van Ronk was also an accomplished acoustic guitar picker; instrumentally and vocally, he brought an intensity to his covers that made the songs his own."

<doc id="18365328" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18365328" title="Episcopal Palace of Porto">
Episcopal Palace of Porto

The Episcopal Palace of Porto () is the former residence of the bishops of Porto, in Portugal. The palace is located on a high elevation, near Porto Cathedral, and dominates the skyline of the city. It is part of the historical centre of Porto, designated World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 
The palace is an important example of late baroque and rococo civil architecture in the city. 
History.
The original Episcopal Palace of Porto was built in the 12th or 13th century, as attested by some architectural vestiges like romanesque-style windows that exist inside the present building. In 1387, this mediaeval palace witnessed the marriage of John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster. 
During the 16th and 17th centuries the palace was greatly enlarged, and an old drawing shows it to be composed of a series of buildings with towers, as was typical for the architecture of Portuguese manor houses of the period. The present palace, however, is the result of a radical rebuilding campaign carried out in the 18th century, which turned it into a baroque work.
It is believed that the project for the Bishop's Palace was drawn in 1734 by the Italian Nicolau Nasoni, an architect with an extense work in Porto and surroundings. Building work started in 1737, under the direction of architect Miguel Francisco da Silva, and proceeded slowly. Due to financial constraints, the original project could never be completed and had to be reduced in scale. The works were only finished in the last decades of the 18th century, under the rule of Bishop Rafael de Mendon√ßa, whose coat-of-arms is located on the main portal and the inner monumental staircase of the palace.
The building was used as residence for the bishops of the city until the 19th century. During the Siege of Porto of 1832, the bishop fled the city and the palace was used by Peter IV's troops as stronghold in the battle against Miguel I. Much later, between 1916 and 1956, when the bishops no longer inhabited the palace, the palace served as seat of the Municipality of Porto. 
Description.
The Episcopal Palace is of rectangular shape with a courtyard in the middle. The main fa√ßade is painted white with three rows of windows and a central portal in dark granite. The frames of the higher row of windows come in different rococo frames. The main portal has a balcony topped by the coat-of-arms of Bishop Rafael de Mendon√ßa, who saw the completion of the building.
Upon entering the palace, the visitor goes through a long vestible that leads to the stairway, which is the highlight of the interior. The monumental stairway, attributed to Nasoni, is composed of a first flight of steps followed by a U-shaped stair. The stairway leads to a baroque portal again with the coat-of-arms of Bishop Mendon√ßa. The whole room is harmoniously decorated with wall paintings and stucco executed between the 18th and the 19th centuries in neoclassical style. In the same century a glass dome was added that provides abundant light to the interior. Other rooms of the palace have less artistic relevance.

<doc id="18365344" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18365344" title="Pleidae">
Pleidae

Pleidae, the pygmy backswimmers, is a family of aquatic insects in the order Hemiptera (infraorder Nepomorpha, or "true water bugs"). There are 37 species in three genera, distributed across most of the world, except the polar regions and remote oceanic islands.
Pleidae belong to the Tripartita which contains the more advanced lineages of true water bugs, and are closely related to the true backswimmers (Notonectidae), but closer still to the Helotrephidae, another family of tiny Nepomorpha, which usually swim upside-down and, like the Pleidae, have a sensory organ in the center of the clypeus. Either the pygmy backswimmers are united with the Helotrephidae in the superfamily Pleoidea, or these two and the true backswimmers are placed in a single superfamily Notonectoidea.
Distribution.
In Europe there is a single species, "Plea minutissima", widely found in that continent. "Plea" species occur in the Old World, while "Neoplea" is found in the Americas. "Paraplea" can be found in all warmer parts of Earth, including Australia, where three species occur. Given their inability to fly well ‚Äì if they can fly at all ‚Äì, it is not surprising that the Pleidae do not have as many endemic island taxa as some other Heteroptera (true bugs). Only five species are known from the entire Malesian archipelago for example. "Neoplea apopkana" has been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in Polynesia. One species, originally native to South Asia and Southeast Asia, was found in aquaria in New Zealand. In 2006, "Paraplea puella" was found to be introduced to Guam in Micronesia. Like in the preceding case, this originally American species was probably accidentally introduced with aquarium plants.
Description.
These tiny Hemiptera are only 2‚Äì3¬†mm long and usually of a light brownish color overall. Their body is oval, plump, with a concave back. Their compound eyes are large and the ocelli vestigial, like in other Nepomorpha. Also characteristic for the infraorder are the short and weak antennae which are usually carried tucked to the head. In the case of the Pleidae the antennae are shorter than the head is long and only consist of three segments.
The scutellum is small and triangular. The wings are reduced in some fully flightless species, but normally developed in most; due to their compact, rotund bodies and generally short wings, even those with well-developed wings fly weakly at best. By and large the Pleidae may be considered an effectively flightless group when it comes to biogeography and dispersal into new habitat.
The tarsi consist of two or three segmnents; two claws are borne on the last tarsal segment of the hindlegs. Though the hindlegs are hairless and appear ill-suited for swimming compared to the stout "flippers" of the water boatmen (Corixidae) or the backswimmers (Notonectidae), the small size of the pygmy backswimmers makes for different physics and allows them to swim well regardless.
Both sexes are able to stridulate. The sounds they produce apparently have an intraspecific communication function, as the animals are able to perceive and react to them. Possibly they make sounds to maintain contact among the loose swarms in which the Pleidae roam their habitat.
The larvae have glands between the third and fourth abdominal tergite. Development is direct, without a pupal stage.
Ecology.
Pygmy backswimmers inhabit lacustrine ecosystems, where they occur in loose groups. Like many of their relatives, they are predatory, hunting other tiny invertebrates, from which they suck out the body fluids with their rostrum. They can to some extent biologically control mosquito larvae. Unlike true backswimmers (Notonectidae), they are completely harmless to humans, as their rostrum is far too small to pierce skin.
Their hindleg claws enable them to clamber through vegetation which apart from swimming is their main form of locomotion. Like Notonectidae, they are in an upside-down position when swimming. This is ultimately because as all true water bugs, Pleidae are air-breathers without gills. Similar to the true backswimmers, pygmy backswimmers carry an air reserve with them which is periodically replenished by a dash to the water's surface. This air is contained in a felt-like cushion on the underside. Thus, the belly has higher buoyancy, resulting in the animal turning upside down as soon as it lets loose from the substrate.

Wildland fire emission

Wildland fire and wildland fire atmospheric emissions have been a part of the global biosphere for millennia. The major wildland fire emissions include greenhouse gasses and several criteria pollutants that impact human health and welfare.:
Compared to the preindustrial era, wildland land fire in the conterminous U.S. has been reduced 90 percent with proportional reductions in wildland fire emissions. Land use changes (agriculture and urbanization) are responsible for roughly 50 percent of this decrease, and land management decisions (land fragmentation, suppression actions, etc.) are responsible for the remainder. Anthropogenic activities (e.g., industrial production, transportation, agriculture, etc.) today have more than replaced the lost preindustrial wildland fire atmospheric emissions.
The following charts compare preindustrial wildland fire emissions with contemporary emissions.

Chris Myers (New Jersey)

Chris Myers (born December 2, 1965) is an American business executive and politician, ex-Mayor in Medford, New Jersey<see Medford Township Website>. He was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district, a seat which was open due to the retirement of incumbent Jim Saxton, in 2008.
Biography.
Myers was raised in Medford Township in southern New Jersey, where he attended public schools and graduated from Shawnee High School. He graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a Bachelor's degree in political science and subsequently earned a Master‚Äôs degree in public administration from Cornell University.
Military experience.
Myers, a decorated combat veteran of the Persian Gulf War, served as the Combat Information Center (CIC) officer, anti-air warfare officer, and operations officer on the Navy‚Äôs first forward deployed Aegis-equipped cruiser, USS "Bunker Hill". In this position, Chris directed the actions of four aircraft carriers and hundreds of land and sea-based aircraft, as well as missile ships from U.S. and allied nations. After leaving USS "Bunker Hill", he served as the joint air defense officer for the combined U.S. and NATO Staff of Commander, Second Fleet and Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic aboard the flagship USS "Mount Whitney". In this capacity, Myers designed and coordinated Air Defense and Tomahawk plans for exercise and real world operations. His military decorations include: a Meritorious Service Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Navy Commendation Medal (with Combat V), several Navy Achievement Medals, Combat Action Ribbon and Liberation of Kuwait Medal.
Professional career.
Upon leaving the Navy, Myers joined Lockheed Martin and became a program manager in the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program Office at NE&SS-Surface Systems. He led the High Range Resolution Program, which consisted of a series of radar enhancements and at-sea tests to support Navy BMD efforts. He was promoted to "Director, Missile Defense and Radar Programs," overseeing Lockheed Martin‚Äôs radar business and role in BMD domestically and internationally.
Ultimately, he was promoted to "Vice President, Business Development." In this capacity, he is responsible for new business acquisition, technology research and development for MS2. Myers has also been "Vice President, Advanced Programs," and "Vice President, Sea-based Missile Defense." Myers was released from his duties at lockheed martin after a sex scandle with a gay prostitute was uncoverd, and is currently spearheading the solar energy projects with his company Global Resource Advisors LLC. 
Political career.
Myers was elected to a four-year term on the Medford Township Council in 2001, and he was re-elected in 2005. After each election, the Township Council selects a mayor and deputy mayor from its members. Myers was selected as mayor in 2003, 2008. and 2011. As councilman and mayor, Myers' chief goals have been stabilization of property taxes and preservation of open space. Myers won re-election in November 2009, along with fellow council members Joe Lynn and Dave Brown.
Positions on issues.
Myers calls himself a "Jim Saxton Republican", "a conservative on taxes and spending, a supporter of the environment and a friend of working men and women." 
Myers is a vocal opponent the Affordable Housing Mandate bill in New Jersey. Myers opposes the bill as a result of its inclusion of a section that creates government imposition of fees on non-residential development in order to build an affordable housing fund. He argues that this concept will be bad for taxpayers and will also destroy the preservation of environmental open space 
Myers is pro-life.
Myers supports expanding child health coverage through SCHIP. He had been an outspoken critic against President George W. Bush's veto of the expansion of SCHIP in 2008.
2008 Congressional campaign.
Myers announced his bid for Congress in January 2008, receiving the endorsement and support of the retiring incumbent Jim Saxton.
Primary.
Other candidates for the Republican nomination included Ocean County Freeholder John P. Kelly and former Tabernacle Township Committeeman Justin Murphy. The campaign in the Republican primary included disputes over taxes. Myers criticized Kelly for having voted to raise Ocean County's spending and taxes. Kelly responded that Myers's attack was hypocritical in light of the 50% increase in Medford's spending during Myers's term on the township's committee. Kelly also charged that Myers's lobbying for the defense industry created a conflict of interest.
Myers won the primary with 49% of the vote to Kelly‚Äôs 26% and Murphy‚Äôs 25%.
Kelly endorsed Myers after the primary, offering his "full support" and any help he could give.
General election.
Myers' Democratic opponent is State Senator John Adler, who ran unopposed for his party's nomination. The only independent candidate in the race is Edward Forchion, who will be running under the "Legalize Marijuana (G.R.I.P.)" Party slogan.
Much of Myers' campaign has focused on painting himself as a Washington and Trenton outsider and portraying his opponent as a career Trenton politician who favors higher taxes and more government spending. 
On July 2, Myers announced he would be taking a leave of absence from his job as a Vice President at Lockheed Martin to focus on the remainder of his Congressional campaign.
After being endorsed in January 2008 by the 3rd congressional district's retiring Congressman, Jim Saxton, several organizations have also given him their support, including Vets for Freedom,
National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition,
Veterans for Victory, 
the National Federation of Independent Businesses,
the National Rifle Association (receiving a grade of A-),
Wake Up America,
and Free and Strong America PAC.
Most newspapers favored Adler over Myers. "The Press of Atlantic City",
Philadelphia Inquirer, 
the "Courier-Post",
"The Burlington County Times",
and "The New York Times",
all gave their endorsement to Adler, often citing his economic policies as their reason for endorsing him. Myers did, however, receive the endorsement of the "Asbury Park Press" on the basis that he is an outsider and not a career politician 
Myers faced a 10‚Äì1 funding gap against Adler, having spent a majority of his early warchest on an expensive primary battle against Kelly and Murphy.
Election results.
On November 4, 2008, after polls closed, the 3rd district race was the last one to be called in New Jersey. With 100% of precincts reporting, Myers lost narrowly to Adler, with 48.4% to his 51.6%.
Sex Scandal.
On October 22, 2011, an alleged extra-marital affair was reported on a website about an encounter in a California Hotel with Mayor Myers.
Mayor Chris Myers vehemently denies the accusation. Shortly afterwards, he was placed on administrative leave from Lockheed Martin.
However, in an interview with the "The Courier Post" newspaper Thursday Oct. 27, 2011, he said that he would not resign as Meford's Mayor, but he didn‚Äôt deny allegations made on an anonymous website that he paid for gay sex while visiting California last October. Also, when asked by the Courier Post if he was "gay or bisexual", Myers replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not commenting on my personal life.‚Äù
On December 5, Myers submitted his resignation from the Medford Township council.

Abazgi languages

Abazgi is the branch of the Northwest Caucasian languages that contains the Abaza and Abkhaz languages. "Abazgi" was once the preferred designation, but has now been replaced mainly by the two subdesignations, "Abkhaz‚ÄìAbaza".
The literary dialects of Abkhaz and Abaza are two ends of a dialect continuum. Grammatically, the two are very similar; however, the differences in phonology are substantial, and are the main reason why many linguists prefer to classify them as distinct languages.

Nagasaki Chinatown

Nagasaki Chinatown (Japanese: Èï∑Â¥éÊñ∞Âú∞‰∏≠ËèØË°ó, Simplified Chinese: ÈïøÂ¥éÊñ∞Âú∞‰∏≠ÂçéË°ó) is an area located in Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan. This area today is a big shopping strip that covers many blocks.
History.
The town was home for many Chinese sailors and traders who trade goods with the Japanese from the 15th to 19th centuries. The Chinese Traders came to Nagasaki because it was the only "open port" to visit Japan at this time. The Tokugawa government only allowed Nagasaki to stay open to the rest of the world, but Closed off the rest of Japan to prevent Western influences and the spread of Christianity. Strict rules were placed on these Chinese traders, forcing them to live in China Town, and preventing them from going outside the town at night. Any one found outside of the town at certain times were arrested by the local guard.

Timiskaming Professional Hockey League

The Timiskaming Professional Hockey League (TPHL) was a minor professional ice hockey league based in the area of Lake Timiskaming, Canada. Founded in 1906, the league is notable for providing teams and Ambrose O'Brien, the founder of the National Hockey Association, which became today's National Hockey League.
History.
The league was founded in the early 1900s in the mining towns of Northern Ontario, Canada. Owned by wealthy mine owners, the league paid its players, one of the few leagues to do so at the time. The games between teams served as the basis for high-stakes gambling between the owners, players and the public. 'Ringers' from the southern ice hockey leagues would be paid to join the teams for a single game, hoping to garner large gambling profits for the team owners.
In a 1909 game between Haileybury and Cobalt at Cobalt, over $10,000 dollars was in the pot in bets. Haileybury won 6‚Äì5 in overtime, with five of the six goals scored by Harry Smith who had been lured from the Montreal Wanderers of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association.
The use of 'ringers' had one negative effect on the league. The league challenged for the Stanley Cup twice in 1909 and was rejected twice by the Stanley Cup trustees because of the 'ineligible' players on Cobalt, the 1909 champion. The trustees implemented a rule that players had to be a member of the team at the start of season, set at January 2.
Just before the 1910 season, the league dissolved so that two of its teams, Cobalt and Haileybury would help to form the National Hockey Association. The owner of the two teams Ambrose O'Brien, along with his family's money financed four teams in the NHA, including the Renfrew Millionaires and the Montreal Canadiens, then known as 'Les Canadiens'. In 1910, after their NHA franchises were dealt away, the TPHL resumed play and Cobalt and Haileybury returned to the league for the 1910‚Äì11 season before ending operations.
Notable players.
These may have been 'ringers' imported for single games:

Helena Kantakouzene, Empress of Trebizond

Helena Kantakouzene (died 1463) was the second wife of David of Trebizond. She was the last Empress of Trebizond.
Family.
Donald Nicol has argued that Helena was the sister of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, and thus the granddaughter of Matthew Kantakouzenos and possibly the daughter of Demetrios I Kantakouzenos. Theodore Spandounes reports that George visited her in Trebizond after 1437.
It is unclear which of David's children were also hers; his nine children‚Äîeight boys and one daughter‚Äîhave been attributed variously to Helena or David's first wife Maria of Gothia by various genealogies. Nevertheless, the oldest sons died with their father 1 November 1463; the youngest son, George, who was three years old, and the daughter Anna were spared. Spandounes states they were sent as a present to Sultan Uzun Hassan of the Aq Qoyunlu, where George was converted to Islam, but he eventually escaped and abjured to Christianity. Spandounes says the name of the king who sheltered George Kantakouzene and gave him his daughter in marriage was named "Gurguiabei", which has been interpreted as a king of Georgia (and either George VIII or Constantine II), or Guria Bey, ruler of Guria. Anna's fate is less clear. The historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles contradicts Spandounes, writing that Anna was an inmate of Mehmet's harem until he gave her to Zaganos Pasha and forced to become a Muslim and marry Sinan, the son of Elvan Bey. A local tradition connects Anna to a village south of Trabizon called "Lady Village", where in 1870 an inscription bearing Anna's name was seen in the village church dedicated to the Archangels.
Empress.
On 15 August 1461, Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire forced Emperor David to surrender his throne in return for a pension. David and his family were settled on estates near Serres in the Struma valley, comprising an annual income of some 300,000 pieces of silver. Although Helena presumably was with him, Donald Nicol mentions a source which states David had sent her to refuge with the Georgian king Mamia or Mania of Gurgia prior to Mehmed's arrival before the walls of Trebizond. After two years, his former retainer George Amiroutzes accused David of conspiring against Mehmed, and the former emperor was executed with all but one of his sons.
According to Spandounes, Helena survived her husband and sons. The Sultan reportedly had ordered their corpses to be left exposed outside the Walls of Constantinople. When she dug the graves with her own hands and buried them, she was condemned to pay a fine of 15,000 ducats or be executed herself. Her retainers raised the money, but Helena dressed in sackcloth and lived out her days in a straw hut near the corpses of her dead family.

Immanuel General Mission

The Immanuel General Mission (Immanueru Sogo Dendo Dan) is an indigenous Japanese holiness denomination founded on 21 October 1945 in Tokyo, Japan by David Tsugio Tsutada (born 1906; died July 1971), ""The John Wesley of Japan."(Sigsworth 237) [http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html] It is a member of the Japan Evangelical Association (JEA).
History.
Origins.
David Tsugio Tsutada was the second son of Henry Tsutada, a Japanese Methodist dentist of Singapore. After studying at Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) in Singapore, Tsutada completed high school in Japan. After graduation he studied law at Cambridge University and also at London. Despite his academic success, Tsutada believed he was called to become a preacher, and so terminated his legal studies and returned to Japan to attend Bible College. Prior to graduation, his college president chose a Christian woman, Nobuko, for him to marry. Tsutada was effective in reaching the poor and marginalised of Tokyo, resulting in several conversions to Christianity. David and Nobuko had five children: John Makoto, Mary Migiwa, Joshua Tadashi, and twins Grace Midorino and Margaret Makiba.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
At the outbreak of World War II, Tsutada refused to erect a Japanese flag in front of his church and bow deeply to the Emperor in the direction of the imperial palace, saying "only God in heaven is divine. We worship Him alone". On 26 June 1942, Tsutada was arrested, along with about 130 others who likewise refused to comply with the regulation. (Keyes 100)After two years, Tsutada was convicted, but released on probation. After the war ended, Tsutada decided to build a church in Tokyo, naming it "Immanuel" because "You, O God, are with us, just as you were in the cell with me."The Immanuel General Mission was organised on 21 October 1945 in Tokyo.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html
Immanuel Bible Training College (1949).
Immanuel Bible Training College in Yokohama, Japan, was founded by David Tsutada in 1949 in Urawa, a city 30 kilometres north of central Tokyo. The college trains young men and women for ministry as pastors in the Immanuel General Mission church of Japan. In 1968, the college moved to Yokohama, which was then a rural area. Today, the campus is surrounded by new homes and businesses, and Yokohama is considered part of the greater Tokyo area.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
Each year, Immanuel ministers to approximately 10 students. Students at Immanuel must have a definite call to ministry before being accepted for training and education. Most students come from the Immanuel General Mission denomination, but many students from other denominations have also prepared for ministry at the school.[http://www.wgm.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=2552&srcid=2821]
Death of David Tsutada and Subsequent Developments.
The Immanuel General Mission grew steadily. Churches were established throughout Japan, including outreach to university students and graduates as well as farmers. By 1988, this organisation had more than 10,000 members spread all over Japan.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
Tsutada died in July 1971. John, his eldest son, took over as President of the Bible Training College (BTC), Pastor of the Tokyo Central Church and the head of the Tsutada family. His eight children went into full-time Christian work as staff members of the Tokyo Central Church, missionaries overseas, and one of them in medical work.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
John's brothers and sisters actively supported the Mission and together, continued to serve the Lord in Japan and elsewhere. Mary, a fine scholar, enrolled at the BTC, married her brother's friend Benjamin Saoshiro, but died prematurely, but not before her son, Ken, became a Christian. Benjamin became pastor, teacher, translator of songs and books from English to Japanese and took charge of the missionaries from Immanuel Church.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
Joshua, the third sibling, after graduation from Rikkyo University, studied at BTC, then at Yeotmal Union Biblical Seminary in India where, after graduation, he stayed on as registrar and preached during the weekends for a total of 14 years. Returning to Japan he pastored a church in Ky≈´sh≈´, and after his brother John became Chairman of Education, Joshua succeeded him as President of the Bible Training College. He serves also as Chairman of the Evangelical Fellowship of Asia.[http://lists.topica.com/lists/wef-world-prayers/read/message.html?sort=a&mid=801252601][http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
Grace and Margaret both studied at BTC and alternated pastoring and looking after their mother. Margaret ultimately went on to do pastoral work not far from Tokyo, and later was sent to begin a church at Beppu. Eventually, her work led her to marrying Benjamin Saoshiro in 1988.[http://www.methodistmessage.com/jun2004/tsutada.html]
Current.
The current president of the IGM is Dr. Isaac Teruo Saoshiro, who also pastors the IGM's mother church, Nakameguro in Tokyo, and serves on the Board of the World Gospel Mission.[http://japanlog.wordpress.com/2006/05/][http://www.wgm.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=467&srcid=996]
Affiliations and Partnerships.
The Immanuel General Mission is affiliated with the Christian Holiness Partnership[http://www.faithstreams.com/topics/members-and-partners/christian-holiness-partnership.html]. Additionally, the IGM partners with the Japanese offices of the World Mission department of the Wesleyan Church and the World Gospel Mission through the Immanuel Wesleyan Federation, a cooperative mission organisation formed in 1954.
South India Bible Seminary (1984).
South India Bible Institute (now South India Biblical Seminary) first opened its doors on 16 November 1937 in Madras (now Chennai). The seminary‚Äôs basic purpose is to train Indian young people for Christian ministry. In 1972, SIBS was reorganized into an indigenous organization with an Indian governing board. The seminary was restructured again in 1981 to include the Church of the Nazarene as a partner with World Gospel Mission. Immanuel General Mission of Japan became a partner in 1984. Most of the seminary‚Äôs professors are Indian.[http://wgm.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=2568&srcid=1013]

Bartholomew Gilbert

Captain Bartholomew Gilbert was an English mariner who in 1602 served as co-captain on the first recorded European expedition to Cape Cod. His decisions resulted in that expedition's failure to establish a colony there.
Voyage to Cape Cod.
Gilbert served aboard "The Concord", a small bark which sailed out of Dartmouth, Devon, to establish a colony in New England (which was then known as Northern Virginia and was considered a part of the Colony of Virginia). The ship's captain was Bartholomew Gosnold, an experienced seaman who had sailed with Walter Raleigh and who was related to Gilbert on Gosnold's father's side.
"The Concord" had thirty-two men on board and sailed due west from the Azores to New England, arriving in May 1602 at Cape Elizabeth in Maine (latitude 43 degrees) and skirted the coastline for several days before anchoring in York Harbor, Maine, on May 14, 1602. The next day, they sailed into Provincetown Harbor and named Cape Cod.
Following the coastline for several days, they discovered and touched at Martha's Vineyard, entered Buzzard's Bay (which they called Gosnold's Hope), and established a small post on Elizabeth's Island, which is now called Cuttyhunk Island and is part of the town of Gosnold. In nineteen days they built a fort and storehouse on an islet and began to trade with the Massachusett in furs, skins, and the sassafras plant. They sowed wheat, barley, and peas, and in fourteen days the young plants had sprung nine inches and more.
They planned to leave Gosnold and some of the crew to start a colony while Gilbert returned to Devon for more supplies. However, when it became known that Gilbert had provided insufficient provisions to overwinter (their provisions, after division, would have lasted only six weeks), all hands decided to return to England with him. They made a very short voyage of five weeks and landed at Exmouth on 23 July. Their freight realised a great profit, the sassafras alone selling for ¬£336 a ton.
A notable account of the voyage, written by John Brereton, one of the gentlemen adventurers, was published in 1602, and this helped in popularising subsequent voyages of exploration and colonisation of the northeast seaboard of North America. A second account by Gabriel Archer was not published until over 20 years later. Although the mission failed to establish a colony, the attempt is commemorated by the New World Tapestry and Gilbert is one of the people represented thereon.
Voyage to Virginia.
In July 1603, Gilbert returned to the Americas. Setting anchor in Chesapeake Bay, Gilbert and four crewmen went ashore to search for the missing members of the Roanoke Colony. They subsequently ran afoul of and were killed by a group of Algonquians on July 29.
The date of this historic landing is represented in the Seal of Northampton County, Virginia. Not until 1607 did the English successfully establish Jamestown, Virginia, their first colony in what is now the United States.

Peace of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski

Peace of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski was a peace treaty signed on December 31, 1435 in Brze≈õƒá Kujawski that ended the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War (1431‚Äì1435). The treaty was signed in the aftermath of the Livonian Order's defeat at the hands of the allied Polish-Lithuanian force in the Battle of Pabaiskas (Wi≈Çkomierz). The Teutonic Knights agreed to cease their support to ≈†vitrigaila (who tried to break the Polish-Lithuanian union) and in the future to support only Grand Dukes properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change borders determined by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Peace of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski showed that Teutonic Knights lost their universal missionary status. Teutonic and Livonian Order no longer interfered with Polish‚ÄìLithuanian affairs; instead Poland and Lithuania involved themselves in the Thirteen Years' War, the civil war in Prussia that tore it in half.

Lyrics to 45th Song.
Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are beyond the scope of description by qualification. I am going down now. Kindly tell me the way. 
(1)Oh shapeless Lord, You are without any desire, but I am with desire. Save me from the delusion and deluge.<br>
(2) Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are above the Vedas, but I am confined to the Vedas. Kindly tell me divine wisdom so that I will get rid of the sins of nature. <br>
(3) Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are beyond the Vedas, but I bear a shape. You take ablution in the Ganges water but I take bath in the well-water of this earth. <br>
(4) Oh Lord of the void, You have got one foot but I have two. Rescue me with Your single foot. <br>
(5) My preceptor is free of sins but I am a great sinner. Oh Lord, rescue me from sins and do not deceive me. <br>
(6) Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are intelligent but I am a fool. Knowing fully well the merits have some kindness for me. <br>
(7) Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are a store house of knowledge and I am ignorant. Kindly rescue me from this dangerous Kali Age. <br>
(8) Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are expert in rescuing and I am fit for being condemned. You can save me from sixty six thousand Kumvi hell in which one has fallen by dragging him. <br>
(9) Oh omniscient Lord, knowing in Your heart which is full of kindness that the creatures has fallen in the mire of sins, rescue him. <br>
(10) Oh preceptor, oh Lord, You are free of diseases and I am full of diseases. Your religion is that of the void and You are endowed with all beauty. This creature is very unfortunate. <br>
(11) Oh preceptor oh Lord, You have no companion or friend, but I am in coupe. As soon as I assumed body, delusion is sticking to my skin and hairs of the skin. <br>
(12) Oh Alekha God, you are my illustrious preceptor and I am your disciple. I am being drowned, save me. What more I will tell you. <br>
(13) My good preceptor is very virtuous, and I am a great sinner. Kindly see my condition and save me from the earth which is like an ocean. My preceptor is the fathomless sea of kindness. His religion is called Mahima. It is not even known to the wise as well as to the Vedas. <br>
(15) The Lord has no shape or form. Then how to meditate on Him. Or Lord, you give result without performance of my religious rites. <br>
(16) You are unthinkable. Your body is of the void. You cannot be described in words. Who can get any trace of Him by means of the holy lores. <br>
(17) Oh pious and wise men, you are poet and learned men. Think within yourself. In this great Kali Age follow Alekha Mahima night and day. <br>
(18) This religion has been evolved in this age and there is no importance in any other religion. One will get deliverance, wealth etc. by adopting this religion. <br>
(19) This is Kali Age; from day to day Kali Age is assuming great proportion in the matter of sins. Following the feet of the preceptor Bhima Kanda has composed up till now 900 stanzas.

Stroke in China

Recent epidemiologic studies confirm that stroke is the most frequent cause of death in the People's Republic of China, with an incidence more than fivefold that of myocardial infarction. Intracerebral hemorrhage causes about one third of all strokes, nearly three times the frequency in North American stroke registries. A marked regional variation in stroke incidence exists, with a threefold higher stroke incidence in northern than in southern Chinese cities, suggesting important environmental or dietary influences. Stroke treatment often involves a combination of modern and traditional herbal medicine; the latter may modify platelet aggregation and blood viscosity. Stroke, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage, is the most frequent and important vascular disorder in China.
China reports more patients with stroke than anywhere else in the world. While there is still a great deal of unknown information, stroke research has been making great progress in recent years, such as in the areas of clinical research, population and genetic epidemiology, brain ischemia/reperfusion exploring, leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), neural stem cell and stroke, neuroprotective treatment for stroke, clinical therapy test in stroke, rehabilitation and prevention. 
Cities and towns in China have integrated systems for registering and investigating strokes. Chinese researchers have followed closely the international level of stroke treatment with a forward position in neural stem cell. Traditional Chinese drugs have featured effects on neuroprotective treatment for stroke which has also been investigated. Chinese scientists have suggested a new way of dividing neuroprotectors in stroke. The clinical therapy test with urokinase and defibrase for cerebral infarction in China is effective and relatively safe, yet the original papers published by Chinese researchers and clinical effects for patient treatment still need to be improved and updated.
Epidemiology.
Stroke is the second commonest cause of death and leading cause of adult disability in China. Chronic diseases now account for an estimated 80% of deaths and 70% of disability-adjusted life-years lost in China. 
The major causes of death in China are vascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease. Unlike in western countries, cerebrovascular disease predominates; the number of patients who die from stroke is more than three times that from coronary heart disease. 
In the past 20 years, China has experienced a rapid economic development. Over time, the proportion of elderly people in the population will likely increase, life expectancies will lengthen, and, as in some other developing countries, the influence of a westernized lifestyle might shift disease patterns towards a profile more similar to that seen in more developed regions, so that the number of strokes will rise.
Total age-adjusted incidence of first-ever stroke in China is not very different from that in developed countries. Stroke incidence, mortality, and prevalence varies widely among different regions within China, with a noticeable north‚Äìsouth gradient. The proportion of intracerebral haemorrhage was high and reached 55% in one city.
Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke. The mass approach combined with a high-risk approach for stroke prevention showed encouraging effects, and various unconventional local therapeutic traditions are commonly used to treat stroke in China.
Several national guidelines on stroke prevention and treatment have been developed. Because of methodological limitations in the epidemiology studies, official government data have been unreliable in terms of making any firm conclusions. There have been calls for urgently needed up-to-date, well-designed, and well-done epidemiological studies and therapeutic trials in China.

White currant

The white currant (whitecurrant) is a sport of the red currant ("Ribes rubrum"), a species of flowering plant in the family Grossulariaceae, native to Europe. It is a deciduous shrub growing to tall and broad, with palmate leaves, and masses of spherical, edible fruit (berries) in summer. The white currant differs from the red currant only in the colour and flavour of these fruits, which are a translucent white. 
Cultivation.
Unlike their close relative the blackcurrant, red and white currants are cultivated for their ornamental value as well as their berries. 
Currant bushes do best in partial to full sunlight. They are relatively low-maintenance plants. 
The cultivar 'White Grape' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. There are also cultivars with yellow and pink fruit, called respectively yellow currants and pink currants.
Culinary uses.
White currant berries are slightly smaller and sweeter than red currants. When made into jams and jellies the result is normally pink. The white currant is actually an albino cultivar of the red currant but is marketed as a different fruit.
White currants are rarely specified in savory cooking recipes compared with their red counterparts. They are often served raw and provide a sweetly tart flavor. White currant preserves, jellies, wines and syrups are also produced. In particular, white currants are the classic ingredient in the highly rarefied Bar-le-duc or Lorraine jelly although preparations made of red currants can also be found.
The berries are a good source of vitamins B1 and C, and are rich in iron, copper and manganese.

The Truce of ≈Åƒôczyca was signed during the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War (1431‚Äì1435) between the Kingdom of Poland and the Teutonic Order in ≈Åƒôczyca on 15 December 1433 (this has also led some Polish historians to divide this Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War into two wars, in 1431‚Äì1433 and in 1435). The Teutonic Knights, pressured by the citizens of their lands, agreed to the 12-year old truce to other Polish demands, including that the Order would cease support to ≈†vitrigaila (a Lithuanian noble who attempted to break the Polish-Lithuanian union with the aid of the Order); in addition each side would control the territories it occupied until a peace would be signed ("uti possidetis"), and no party would seek mediation of foreign powers to change this truce. This marked the end of the war on Polish territories; the struggle on Lithuanian lands would continue for two more years (as the truce with Poland did not extend to the Livonian Order).

Firsby railway station

Firsby railway station was a busy station in Firsby, Lincolnshire which closed in 1970 as a result of the Beeching Axe. Firsby served as a main line station and a terminus for two branch lines, one to the seaside resort of Skegness and one to the market town of Spilsby.
Firsby station was located in a small rural linear village 36¬†miles (58¬†km) east from the county town of Lincoln, 4¬†miles (6.4¬†km) south east of the nearest market town of Spilsby and 8¬†miles (12.9¬†km) inland from the popular holiday resort town of Skegness.
Opening.
The railway station at Firsby opened on 3 September 1848, and was a substantial structure for a country station, totally unlike the majority of small isolated rural halts. The station had three platforms each two twenty hundred yards long and covered with buildings, booking offices, several waiting rooms (male, female and general), restaurants, toilets, baggage and goods halls, crew rooms, staff canteen and housing, and several railway offices. The main line tracks were crossed by a substantial passenger footbridge and most of the station was covered by an ornate cast-iron and glass canopy normally only seen at main city stations. The station also had signal boxes, water towers, extensive goods sidings and engine repair sheds.
The station was served by two public houses, one of which doubled as the Firsby Railway Hotel. There are several mentions in old records of a second drinking establishment around 1852, called Whyley's Beerhouse, that stood adjacent to Firsby railway Station.
Branch lines.
Firsby was a junction for the Skegness line and the Spilsby line on their short branches from the main Great Northern Railway's London Kings Cross to Cleethorpes east coast mainline railway. During the summer months holiday passenger traffic from all over the country alighting at Firsby for their connection to Skegness was substantial with hundreds and sometimes thousands of passengers passing through the station at a weekend and the platforms would be teeming with families and their luggage. In the Victorian era most holidaymakers travelled by train and Firsby was one of the busiest stations on the east coast main line. The station was the major employer in the area and between the station master and his assistants, ticket office staffs, ticket inspectors, signalmen, porters, catering staffs, drivers, firemen, guards and track maintenance staff for three separate railway companies, several hundred people worked at or from Firsby station on a regular daily basis.
Between 1943 and 1958 Firsby station was kept busy as the nearest railhead staging point for RAF and later USAF airmen travelling to and from the nearby RAF Spilsby airfield at Great Steeping.
Closure.
The line was closed down in 1970 due to the Beeching axe cuts, and the majority of the station and the platforms were demolished. Only the most southerly section of the station building remains and is now a private residence. With the old east coast mainline between Firsby and Cleethorpes removed a new direct link to Skegness was installed at the junction a few hundred metres south of the old Firsby station. Although the station is long gone many locals still remember the station master calling out "Skegness passengers, Over the bridge for Skegness!"
Timetable for February 1863.
The table below shows the train departures from Firsby & Spilsby station on weekdays in February 1863. At this point, the East Lincolnshire line is only 13 years old, and none of the branch lines have been built yet, but Firsby is still an important station on account of being the railhead for the nearby town of Spilsby.
Timetable for July 1922.
The table below shows the train departures from Firsby station on weekdays in July 1922, when services were at their peak. The most recent addition, the Midville line has been open for 9 years. This was built mainly for excursion trains to Skegness, and the local service is sparse, consisting of only 2 trains each way per day, with one extra on Mondays and Saturdays.

Adelaide Avalanche

The Adelaide Avalanche were a semi-professional ice hockey team based in Thebarton, South Australia that played in the Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL). The club was formed in 2000 and was arguably the most successful team in the short history of the AIHL, winning five minor premierships and two championships in their eight years of competition.
History.
Along with the Sydney Bears and Canberra Knights, the Avalanche were one of the founding members of the AIHL in 2000. They finished first out of the three teams that year and claimed the inaugural AIHL championship. In 2001, the club enjoyed the same success in winning their second consecutive title.
In 2002, the Melbourne Ice, Western Sydney Ice Dogs, and Newcastle North Stars joined the AIHL, expanding it to six teams. The Goodall Cup, Australia's top prize in ice hockey, also became part of the AIHL that year. Adelaide again finished second in the overall standings and lost to the Bears in the Goodall Cup final.
The Avalanche finished the 2003 season with their fourth straight minor premiership but lost to the Ice Dogs in the first round of a newly introduced four-team playoff system. They would lose in the semifinals again in 2004 to the North Stars in double overtime.
As two more teams‚Äîthe Brisbane Blue Tongues and Central Coast Rhinos‚Äîentered the league in 2005, the Avalanche returned to dominance by finishing first overall in the regular season standings. The "curse of the minor premiers" once again came back to haunt the team, however. Despite winning through to the Goodall Cup final for the first time in three years, they were defeated 3‚Äì1 by the North Stars in that game.
The Avalanche have retooled for 2006 in the quest for their first-ever Goodall Cup, with their current roster boasting Mighty Roos players Greg Oddy and brothers Ben & Luke Thilthorpe. They finished second after the regular season and hosted the finals series, beating the Ice Dogs 5‚Äì2 to reach the final but losing the final 0-4 to the North Stars.
Members of the Adelaide Avalanche were featured on episode 11 of Network Ten's "Cyber Shack TV" on 10 October 2006. Both David Huxley and Brad Wanchulak played and reviewed the new "NHL 2K6" on Xbox 360.
The Avalanche came into financial difficulties in 2008, and after being able to host several game at the start of the season, could not meet its road commitments, forcing the team to withdraw from the remainder of the season on June 17. The team's players were transferred to the newly formed Adelaide A's, who in a deal with the AIHL was allowed to play the remainder of the Avalanche's season.
Championships.
The club won five minor premierships (V.I.P. Cup) and one championships (AIHL) in nine years.

Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's Almira (Liszt)

Franz Liszt composed his transcription of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera "Almira" for piano solo (S.181) in 1879 for his English piano student Walter Bache to play at a Handel festival in England. The "Almira" transcription is noted by critics as one of the most striking of Liszt's late concert arrangements as well as his only setting of a baroque piece from his late period.
Liszt's decision to set Handel was probably due at least in part to please British audiences, for whom Handel was still the preeminent national composer and before whom Bache would likely appear. Nevertheless, the choice of subject matter was surprising, not only by being Handel instead of Bach but also from being taken from a Handel opera which was virtually ignored at the time.
In his most recent baroque transcription prior to "Almira", that of Bach's Fantasie and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 dating from 1867, Liszt follows the original almost exactly. With "Almira", Liszt deviates considerably. While retaining the original contour of Handel's melodies, he changes the order of dances (in the opera the chaconne is followed by the sarabande), then adds introductory, transitional and developmental material along with his own varied treatment of the dances themselves.
The result of Liszt's work is a highly unified double-set of variations ‚Äî one set of variations on the sarabande followed by a separate set on the chaconne ‚Äî nearly becoming an independent work in the process. (Humphrey Searle in fact catalogued the work as an independent composition.) The sarabande dominates the piece, functioning much like a Bach chaconne as variations on a harmonic progression, while the chaconne itself is of the balletic variety, having nothing to do with the repeated bass lines of the work. This work is said by some to anticipate Ferruccio Busoni's late-romantic settings of Bach in its overall grandeur, 
especially in the major key transformation of the sarabande at the work's conclusion.

Halton Holegate railway station

Halton Holegate railway station is a former station in Halton Holegate, Lincolnshire. It was on a short branch from Firsby to Spilsby.
History of the branch line.
A small private local railway company built a branch line from Firsby junction to Spilsby, which opened on 1 May 1868. The branch was just over four miles (6¬†km) long and connected Spilsby to the Kings Cross London to Cleethorpes main line. The necessary parliamentary permission had been obtained by an Act in July 1865 which incorporated the Spilsby & Firsby Railway Company with an authorised capital of ¬£20,000 and loans of ¬£8,333 for the construction of the four-mile (6¬†km) long, single-track branch.
Construction of the railway began in March 1867. Ceremonial cutting of the first turf was performed by local rector, The Reverend Rawnsley, who was standing in for the railway company's chairman Lord Willoughby de Eresby the 25th Baron. The Railway was expected to be opened quickly but disputes with the contractors arose over the quality of their work, and several lengths of track had to be replaced. The Great Northern Railway bought out the Spilsby & Firsby Railway Company for ¬£20,000 through an Act of Parliament on 25 July 1890. Halton Holegate Halt was the only other intermediate station on the short branch line.
Passenger services were suspended in 1939. A goods service for grain, potatoes, livestock and other agricultural products continued for nearly 20 years. Goods including petrol, paraffin and coal continued to come into Spilsby via the rail link up to its final closure on 30 November 1958.
Halton Holegate station.
Halton Holegate station had a single platform on the up side and the main station building included the station master's residence, a booking office and a small waiting room. Other buildings included a signal box, an engine shed and a cattle pen alongside a loop siding.
The station has been sold into private ownership and the original station building extended as a private residence. The engine shed remains in good condition and the track bed has been infilled to the level of the platform.

Cellular confinement

Cellular Confinement Systems (CCS, also known as geocells) are widely used in construction for erosion control, soil stabilization on flat ground and steep slopes, channel protection, and structural reinforcement for load support and earth retention. Typical cellular confinement systems are made with ultrasonically-welded high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or Novel Polymeric Alloy strips that are expanded on-site to form a honeycomb-like structure which may be filled with sand, soil, rock or concrete.
History of Cellular Confinement.
Research and development of cellular confinement systems (CCS) began with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in September¬†1975 to test the feasibility of constructing tactical bridge approach roads over soft ground. Engineers discovered that sand-confinement systems performed better than conventional crushed stone sections. They concluded that a sand-confinement system could be developed that would provide an expedient construction technique for building approach roads over soft ground and that the system would not be adversely affected by wet weather conditions.
These early efforts led to the civilian commercialization of the first cellular confinement system known as Geoweb¬Æ by the Presto Products Company. The cellular confinement system was made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) that was light weight, strong and durable.
This new Geoweb cellular confinement system was used first for load support applications in the United States in the early 1980s; second for slope erosion control and channel lining in the United States in 1984 and; third for earth retention in Canada in 1986. Research on cellular confinement in these application areas in cooperation with Presto Products also started during the 1980s. 
Research by Drs. Bathurst and Jarrett discovered that cellular confinement reinforced gravel bases are ‚Äúequivalent to about twice the thickness of unreinforced gravel bases‚Äù when placed over a saturated peat sub-base. Further, 1.25¬†mm (50 mil) HDPE performed better than single sheet reinforcement schemes (geotextiles and geogrids) and was more effective in reducing lateral spreading of the infill material under loading than conventional reinforced bases. In terms of the effectiveness of confinement, geocells have more attractive features due to its 3D structure than any other planar geosynthetic reinforcement. Since this early work, the results of large-scale triaxial test on isolated geocells has demonstrated that cellular confinement imparts apparent cohesion to cohesionless compacted granular material on the order of 169¬†kPa - 190¬†kPa (3500¬†psf - 4000¬†psf).
Cellular confinement systems are now recognized as an important technology when applied to load support (Webster, 1986 and Bathurst & Jarrett, 1988) under roads and rail lines, gravity and reinforced earth retaining wall systems (Crowe, Bathurst & Alston, 1989), (Bathurst, Crowe & Zehaluk, 1993), slope stabilization and erosion control, channel lining systems (Engel,¬†P. & Flato,¬†G. 1987) (Simons, Li & Associates, 1988) (Wu & Austin, 1992) and other innovative uses.
Cellular Confinement Systems (CCS, also known as geocells) are widely used in construction for erosion control, soil stabilization on flat ground and steep slopes, channel protection, and structural reinforcement for load support and earth retention. Typical cellular confinement systems are made with ultrasonically-welded high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or Novel Polymeric Alloy strips that are expanded on-site to form a honeycomb-like structure which may be filled with sand, soil, rock or concrete.
Recent Developments in Cellular Confinement Technology.
Despite the effectiveness of the geocell technology, particularly in slope and channel applications, its use in base reinforcement of paved roads and railways was limited due to the lack of design methods, lack of advanced research in the last two decades and limited understanding of the reinforcement mechanisms (Yuu, et al. 2008).) Recent research in the last few years on geocell reinforcement for roadway applications - reflected by some 40 published papers - has been conducted at the University of Kansas as well as at other leading research institutes around the world, to understand the mechanisms and influencing factors of geocell reinforcement, evaluate its effectiveness in improving roadway performance, and develop design methods for roadway applications (Han, et al. 2011).
Research was conducted on HPDE geocells as well as geocells manufactured from a novel polymeric alloy (NPA), called Neoloy, developed by PRS. NPA is a composite polymeric alloy based on nano-fibers (polyester and nylon) in a polyolefin matrix. The NPA combines the desired properties of polyethylene and polyester, thus enabling a more effective use of geocells in new critical applications, such as reinforcement for earth retention, load support in pavements and railroads and more (Leshchinsky, et al., 2009). While HDPE is the commonly used material for geocells, leading researchers have questioned its suitability for long term applications (Leshchinsky, et al., 2009). This concern is backed up by ‚Äúfacts on the ground‚Äù as HDPE geocells are rarely used in critical applications, such as in the base layer of major highways and railways, subject to long-term heavy static and dynamic loading.
Laboratory plate loading tests on geocells showed that the performance of geocell-reinforced bases depends on the elastic modulus of the geocell. The geocell with a higher elastic modulus had a higher bearing capacity and stiffness of the reinforced base. Geocells made from NPA were found significantly better in ultimate bearing capacity, stiffness, and reinforcement relative to geocells made from HDPE (Pokharel, et al., 2009). NPA geocells showed better creep resistance and better retention of stiffness and creep resistance particularly at elevated temperatures, verified by plate load testing, numerical modeling and full scale trafficking tests (Pokharel, et al. 2011). Research demonstrated that NPA geocells have a lower thermal expansion coefficient and creep reduction factor, and higher tensile stiffness and strength than HDPE geocells.(Thakur, et al., 2010); and NPA increased the bearing capacity and reduced settlement of compacted sand base courses significantly more than geocells fabricated from HDPE (Pokharel, 2011, et al.). 
Laboratory studies, full-scale moving wheel tests, and field demonstrations (cosponsored by US DOT Department of Transportation as well as state DOTs) have demonstrated clear benefits of NPA (novel polymeric alloy) geocell reinforcement in terms of increased stiffness and bearing capacity, wider stress distribution, reduced permanent deformation, and prolonged roadway life, while the design methods developed and calibrated in this research can help engineers design future roadway applications using geocells (Han, et al. 2011). This close cooperation and iterative research and development process between private industry and academia was cited by the editor of "Geosynthetics" magazine, as: ‚Äú"an example of how product development for the geosynthetics industry can be done effectively‚Ä¶ and can further advance the geosynthetics industry into the 21st century with much success".‚Äù
Application vs. Long-term Performance.
HDPE-based geocells have been successfully installed in thousands of projects worldwide. However, it is incumbent to differentiate between low load applications, such as slope and channel applications, and new heavy-duty applications, such as in the base layer of asphalt pavement structures of heavily trafficked motorways and highways. While all polymeric materials used in geocells creep over time and under loading, the question is; what is the rate of degradation, under which conditions, how will this impact performance, and when will it fail? 
The lifespan of geocells in slope protection applications, for example, is less critical as vegetative growth and root interlock stabilize the soil. This in effect compensates for any long-term loss of confinement in the geocells. Similarly, load support applications for low volume roads that are not subject to heavy loading usually have a short design life; therefore any minor loss of performance is tolerable. However, in critical applications such as reinforcement of the structural layer of asphalt highway pavements, long term dimensional stability is critical. The required design life for such roads under heavy traffic loads is typically 20‚Äì25 years, requiring verifiable long-term durability.
The Development of Standards for Testing Geocells.
Standards for geocells have not kept pace with the developments in the field of testing for material sciences, ignoring ASTM and ISO methods for testing, verification and quality assurance of polymer plastics, such as TMA - Thermomechanical analysis, DMA - Dynamic Mechanical Analysis, Stepped Isothermal Method (SIM) and CTE - Coeffecient of Thermal expansion. These methods are particularly suited for predicting long-term behavior and accumulated plastic strain in a geosynthetic under loading under different mechanical stresses, frequencies and temperatures. These widely accepted testing methods are used by the pipe, automobile, electronic, military, security and construction industries. Geomembrane testing, for example, utilizes accelerated test methods, which use temperature to stimulate aging over time to evaluate their durability.
Unfortunately, these ASTM/ISO procedures commonly utilized by many other industries to evaluate performance have not been adopted by the most of geocell industry. Current standards evolved from the world of 2D planar geosynthetics. These do not fully reflect the composite behavior of 3D geometry in soil, nor do they test long-term parameters such as: dynamic loading, permanent plastic deformation, effect of temperatures, environmental durability, etc. Therefore, new standards for geocells were proposed and under discussion by leading experts in geosynthetics in ASTM technical committee D-35. The goal is to set new industry standards that more accurately reflect 3D geocell geometry and material performance in the field rather than lab tests of individual strips and virgin materials that are used by most manufacturers today.
How it Works.
A Cellular Confinement System when infilled with compacted soil creates a new composite entity that possesses enhanced mechanical and geotechnical properties. When the soil contained within a geocell is subjected to pressure, it causes lateral stresses on perimeter cell walls. The 3D zone of confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles while vertical loading on the contained infill results in high lateral stress and resistance on the cell-soil interface. These increase the shear strength of the confined soil, which: 
Confinement from adjacent cells provides additional resistance against the loaded cell through passive resistance, while lateral expansion of the infill is restricted by high hoop strength. Compaction is maintained by the confinement resulting in long term reinforcement.
Applications.
Load Support.
Cellular Confinement Systems (CCS) have been used to improve the performance of both paved and unpaved roads by reinforcing the soil in the subgrade-base interface or within the base course. The effective load distribution of CCS creates a strong, stiff cellular mattress. This 3D mattress reduces vertical differential settlement into soft subgrades, improves shear strength, and enhances load-bearing capacity, while reducing the amount of aggregate material required to extend the service life of roads. As a composite system, cellular confinement strengthens the aggregate infill, thereby simultaneously enabling the use of poorly graded inferior material (e.g. local native soils, quarry waste or recycled materials) for infill as well as reducing the structural support layer thickness.
Typical load support applications include reinforcement of base and subbase layers in flexible pavements, including: asphalt pavements; unpaved access, service and haul roads; railway substructure and ballast confinement; working platforms in intermodal ports; airport runways and aprons, permeable pavements; pipeline road support; green parking facilities and emergency access areas.
Slope and Channel Protection.
The three-dimensional lateral confinement of CCS along with anchoring techniques ensures the long-term stability of slopes using vegetated topsoil, aggregate or concrete surfacing (if exposed to severe mechanical and hydraulic pressures). The enhanced drainage, frictional forces and cell-soil-plant interaction of CCS prevents downslope movement and limits the impact of raindrops, channeling and hydraulic shear stresses. The perforations in the 3D cells allow the passage of water, nutrients and soil organisms. This encourages plant growth and root interlock, which further stabilizes the slope and soil mass, and facilitates landscape rehabilitation. Typical applications include: construction cut and fill slopes and stabilization; road and rail embankments; pipeline stabilization and storage facility berms; quarry and mine site restoration; channel and coastline structures.
Earth Retention.
CCS systems provide steep vertical mechanically stabilized earth structures (either gravity or reinforced walls) for steep faces, walls and irregular topography. Construction of CCS earth retention is simiplified as each layer is structurally sound thereby providing access for equipment and workers, while eliminating the need for concrete formwork and curing. Local soil can be used for infill when suitable and granular, while the outer faces enable a green or tan fascia of the horizontal terraces/rows utilizing topsoil. Walls also can be used for lining channels and in cases of high flow, it is required that the outer cells contain concrete or cementious slurry infill.
Reservoirs and Landfills.
CCS provides membrane liner protection, while creating stable soil, berms and slopes, for non-slip protection and durable impoundment of liquids and waste. Infill treatment depends on the contained materials: concrete for ponds and reservoirs; gravel for landfill drainage and leachates, vegetated infill for landscape rehabilitation. Concrete work is efficient and controlled as CCS functions as ready-made forms; CCS with concrete forms a flexible slab that accommodates minor subgrade movement and prevents cracking. In medium and low flow-velocities, CCS with geomembranes and gravel cover can be used to create impermeable channels, thereby eliminating the need for concrete.
Sustainable Construction.
CCS is a green solution that makes civil infrastructure projects more sustainable. In load support applications, by reducing the amount and type of infill needed to reinforce soil, the usage of haul and earthmoving equipment is reduced. This in turn decreases fuel use, pollution and the carbon footprint, and at the same time minimizes on-site disruption from dust, erosion and runoff. When used for slope applications, perforated geocells provides excellent soil protection, water drainage and growth stratum for plants. The long-term design life of advanced CCS technology means that maintenance and the associated environmental costs are significantly reduced, as are long-term economic costs.

Academy of St Olave's

The Academy of St Olaves is an English chamber orchestra that play in the beautiful setting of St Olave's Church, York, England.
The Academy performs three concerts each year and plays for one orchestral Mass on Remembrance Sunday. The orchestra's repertoire ranges from music of the seventeenth century to that of the present day; from Corelli and Purcell through Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to Stravinsky, Britten and Tavener.
The Academy was founded in 1978 by Charles Macdonald, Organist and Director of Music at St. Olave's Church, in conjunction with local headmaster-violinist, Robin Gilbert. The reason was to raise money for essential work to be done on the very fine organ at the church. The first concert was given on 8 January 1978 and was preceded by an article in the York newspaper, "The Press".
By the time funds had been raised the Academy of St Olave's was sufficiently well-established in the musical calendar of York for it to continue to give concerts. After Charles Macdonald moved from York in the early 1980s his successor, Chris Liddle continued with the orchestra, occasionally adding wind players as and when needed, a practice which further developed when Andrew Wright became Musical Director. By the time John Hastie was appointed Musical Director in 1997 the Academy had become a chamber orchestra and it adopted the policy of playing for the Solemn Requiem Mass on Remembrance Sunday at St Olave's Church, offering the Requiem settings by Gabriel Faur√© and Maurice Durufl√© on alternate years. The current director of the Academy is the celebrated Fitzwilliam Quartet viola player, Alan George. 
The Academy of St Olave's orchestra does not rehearse on a weekly basis - rehearsals are scheduled over a 2 week period prior to each concert. Players are invited from a large pool of instrumentalists, according to the forces required. 
Players in the Academy come from a wide range of backgrounds including teachers, gifted amateurs, students, talented school children and professional players. The minimum standard is Grade VIII and players are expected to have a high level of commitment and enthusiasm.

Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt

Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt (February 2, 1817 ‚Äì December 25, 1888) was the first wife of LDS Apostle and polygamist Orson Pratt and later a critic of Mormon polygamy. She was a founder of the Anti-Polygamy Society in Salt Lake City and called herself a Mormon apostate. She was born in Henderson, Jefferson County, New York, the first daughter and third child of Cyrus Bates and Lydia Harrington Bates.
Early life and marriage.
Sarah Marinda Bates lived in Henderson, New York from the time of her birth in 1817 until October 1836. While she was there, her family encountered Mormon missionaries and in the summer of 1835 she and several siblings were baptized into the faith. She also fell in love with one of the missionaries, Orson Pratt, who after continuing to preach in other areas returned to seek Sarah's hand in marriage. They were wed July 4, 1836, and Orson returned to his missionary travels after a three-day honeymoon. Sarah stayed with her family with only periodic visits from her husband until the couple moved in October to an apartment in Kirtland, Ohio.
Children and migration.
The Pratts' stay in Kirtland would be short-lived. Amidst the economic difficulties of 1837 and the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society, Sarah gave birth to their first son Orson Jr. With few financial prospects in Kirtland, the family moved back to Henderson as soon as the infant was capable of the journey, and several months later relocated to New York City. In July 1838, Orson Pratt was called to gather with a number of other church elders at Far West, Missouri to prepare for another mission.
The move to Missouri was difficult due to Sarah's pregnancy with their second child. They reached St. Louis and their daughter Lydia was born on December 17, 1838. Violence in Missouri led to the expulsion of the Mormons from that state, and the Pratts were forced to flee to the upriver settlements on the Mississippi. They eventually found a "shanty" in nascent Nauvoo, Illinois. There, baby Lydia fell ill with one of the epidemics that ravaged the swamplands and died in August 1839. Orson left eleven days later to serve a mission to Europe.
With her husband in Europe Sarah had to provide for her family and she did so by taking in sewing. She was hired by Joseph Smith's family to do some sewing and Joseph referred her to John C. Bennett, a recent convert to Mormonism who had quickly become a close associate of Smith.
Plural marriage proposal of Joseph Smith.
In an 1886 interview, Sarah Pratt stated that, while in Nauvoo around 1840 or 1841, Joseph Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her "one of his spiritual wives." According to Bennett, while Orson was in England on missionary service, Smith proposed to Pratt by claiming divine inspiration: "Sister Pratt, the Lord has given you to me as one of my "spiritual wives". I have the blessings of Jacob granted me, as he granted holy men of old, and I have long looked upon you with favor, and hope you will not repulse or deny me", to which Bennett claimed Pratt replied: "Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ‚Ä¶ to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, and that is enough for me." Also according to Bennett, Smith made three additional proposals. By Bennett's account, Pratt issued an ultimatum to Smith: "Joseph, if you ever attempt any thing of the kind with me again, I will tell Mr. Pratt on his return home. Depend upon it, I will certainly do it," a warning that elicited the threat from Smith, "Sister Pratt, I hope you will not expose me; if I am to suffer, all suffer; so do not expose me... If you should tell, I will ruin your reputation, remember that." 
After Orson returned from England, Bennett reports, another incident between Pratt and Smith occurred at her home. According to Sarah Pratt's neighbor, Mary Ettie V. Smith, "Sarah ordered the Prophet out of the house, and the Prophet used obscene language to her that he had found Bennett in bed with her." Sarah told her husband about the incident; Orson took Sarah's side and confronted Smith, who denied Sarah's allegation and responded that she was Bennett's lover. 
The resulting estrangement between Smith and Orson Pratt, who stood by Sarah in preference to the denials of Joseph and the accusations against Bennett, brought forth a warning from Smith that "If did believe his wife and follow her suggestions he would go to hell". Wilford Woodruff stated that "Dr. John Cook Bennett was the ruin of Orson Pratt". 
Van Wagoner and Walker note that, on August 20, 1842, "after four days of fruitless efforts at reconciliation, the Twelve excommunicated Pratt for 'insubordination' and Sarah for 'adultery'" with Bennett.
Orson soon returned to the church and denounced Bennett and his book. Van Wagoner cites a letter written by Orson's brother Parley P. Pratt, 
Orson wrote a postscript to his brother's letter: "J.C. Bennett has published lies concerning myself & family & the people with which I am connected".
Criticism in the local and Mormon press.
Sarah Pratt was accused of having had an adulterous relationship with Bennett, and numerous affidavits printed in the local and pro-Mormon Nauvoo press (e.g., the "Nauvoo Wasp"), as well as by Jacob B. Backenstos, a relative of the sheriff of Hancock County, testified to these allegations. Sarah Pratt had stayed with Stephen H. Goddard and his wife, Zeruiah, while Orson Pratt was away on missionary work in England. The Goddards stated under oath that from the first night, Bennett "was there as sure as the night came," and that "he remained later, sometimes till after midnight." During this time Bennett and Pratt "sat close together, he leaning on her lap, whispering continually or talking very low." Zeruiah Goddard reported that on another occasion she "came suddenly into the room where Mrs. Pratt and the Dr. were; she was lying on the bed and the Dr. was taking his hands out of her bosom; he was in the habit of sitting on the bed where Mrs. Pratt was lying, and lying down over her." The Goddards said they visited Pratt in a home furnished to her by Dr. Robert Foster there several times late in the evening and found Bennett and Sarah Pratt together, "as if they were man, and wife." Pratt claimed in 1886, when disaffected from the church, that when the testimonials were published, she went straight to the Goddard's home and Stephen ran out the back door, but that she confronted Zeruiah, who sobbed 
However, Foster made the following allegation against Bennett and Pratt: 
Van Wagoner has concluded that the adultery charges against Sarah Pratt are "highly improbable" and that J. B. Backenstos's affidavit stating that Bennett continued the adulterous relationship with Sarah Pratt after Orson returned from England could "be dismissed as slander." In addition to Sarah, Nancy Rigdon and Martha Brotherton "also suffered slanderous attacks because they exposed the Church's private polygamy posture." However, Bennett gave an affidavit clearing Smith of wrongdoing, 
Bennett ultimately became a vehement opponent of Smith and the church, authoring the book "The History of the Saints; or An Expos√© of Joe Smith and Mormonism," of which Sarah Pratt later stated "know that the principle statements in John C. Bennett's book on Mormonism are true," whereas affidavits and testimonies of church members at the time denounced Bennett. Orson Pratt stated, 
Allegation of abortions.
In her 1886 interview with "vitriolic anti-Mormon journalist W. Wyl", Sarah Pratt alleged that Joseph Smith allowed Bennett, a medical doctor, to perform abortions on Smith's polygamous wives who were officially single. In a public charge "that was likely true," according to author Andrew Smith, Bennett was accused by many of performing abortions, including Hyrum Smith; Zeruiah Goddard claimed Bennett told Sarah Pratt "that he could cause abortion with perfect safety to the mother at any stage of pregnancy, and that he had frequently destroyed and removed infants before their time to prevent exposure of the parties, and that he had instruments for that purpose." If the women refused, Bennett stated that he came with Joseph's approval. Sarah Pratt herself recounted an incident in which 
Pratt also related her observations of Bennett's work for Joseph Smith to Smith's son Joseph Smith III, 
However, Smith III's own published account differed from Pratt's recollection, 
Opposition to plural marriage and apostasy.
Sarah Pratt ended her marriage to husband Orson Pratt in 1868 because of his "obsession with marrying younger women" and condemned polygamy because: 
Pratt was one of the founders of the Anti-Polygamy Society in Salt Lake City. Pratt lashed out at Orson in an 1877 interview, 
In 1874 she testified for Utah candidate Liberal Robert Baskin, who accused his opponent George Q. Cannon of polygamy and said that his obligation to the Mormon hierarchy was superior to national law.
On her leaving the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for which she was excommunicated on 4 October 1874, Pratt declared in 1875 that, 
Van Wagoner concludes, "Polygamy made her a radical...By making public Joseph Smith's overtures and resisting what she considered to be collective infidelity, Sarah Pratt was judged a threat to the safety of the Church and considered to have committed apostasy."
Children.
Pratt, who resolved to "rear my children so that they should never espouse the Mormon faith while concealing from my neighbors and the church authorities that I was thus rearing them," had twelve children by husband Orson Pratt:

The Mayor of MacDougal Street (subtitled "Rarities 1957-1969") is a compilation album by American folksinger Dave Van Ronk, released in 2005.
History.
"The Mayor of MacDougal Street" contains previously un-released songs and is presented in chronological order. It contains both solo material and songs recorded with session musicians and bands that either backed Van Ronk or he was a member of. It was included with the memoir of the same title before being released as a separate CD. The title refers to MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Steve Leggett wrote of the album "Van Ronk was never a part of the tradition-at-all-costs wing of the folk movement, and he readily embraced the young songwriters of the day, frequently covering their songs, as evidenced by the hushed, nuanced version of Leonard Cohen's "Bird on the Wire" that is included here. A skilled raconteur, Van Ronk had the timing of a jazz hornman, and that timing and his wide-ranging musical interests are everywhere apparent on this lovingly assembled look behind the curtains."

Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial

The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial is a memorial site in France dedicated to the commemoration of Dominion of Newfoundland forces members who were killed during World War I. The preserved battlefield park encompasses the grounds over which the Newfoundland Regiment made their unsuccessful attack on 1 July 1916 during the first day of the Battle of the Somme.
The Battle of the Somme was the regiment's first major engagement, and during an assault that lasted approximately 30 minutes the regiment was all but wiped out. Purchased in 1921 by the people of Newfoundland, the memorial site is the largest battalion memorial on the Western Front, and the largest area of the Somme battlefield that has been preserved. Along with preserved trench lines, there are a number of memorials and cemeteries contained within the site.
Officially opened by British Field Marshal Earl Haig in 1925, the memorial site is one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada. (The other is the Canadian National Vimy Memorial). The memorial site and experience of the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont-Hamel has come to represent the Newfoundland First World War experience. As a result, it has become a Newfoundland symbol of sacrifice and a source of identity.
Background.
During the First World War, Newfoundland was a largely rural Dominion of the British Empire with a population of 240,000, and not yet part of Canada. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led the Government of Newfoundland to recruit a force for service with the British Army. Even though the island had not possessed any formal military organization since 1870, enough men soon volunteered that a whole battalion was formed, and later maintained throughout the war. The regiment trained at various locations in the United Kingdom and increased from an initial contingent of 500 men to full battalion strength of 1,000 men, before being deployed. After a period of acclimatization in Egypt, the regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula with the 29th British Division in support of the Gallipoli Campaign. With the close of the Gallipoli Campaign the regiment spent a short period recuperating before being transferred to the Western Front in March 1916.
Battle of the Somme.
In France, the regiment regained battalion strength in preparation for the Battle of the Somme. The regiment, still with the 29th British Division, went into the line in April 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel. Beaumont-Hamel was situated near the northern end of the 45-kilometre front being assaulted by the joint French and British force. The attack, originally scheduled for 29 June 1916 was postponed by two days to July 1, 1916, partly on account of inclement weather, partly to allow more time for the artillery preparation. The 29th British Division, with its three infantry brigades faced defences manned by experienced troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment of the 26th (Wurttemberg) Reserve Division. The 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment had been involved in the invasion of France in August 1914 and had been manning the Beaumont-Hamel section of the line for nearly 20 months prior to the battle. The German troops spending a great deal of their time not only training but fortifying their position, including the construction of numerous deep dugouts and at least two tunnels.
The infantry assault by the 29th British Division on 1 July 1916 was to be preceded ten minutes earlier by a mine explosion under the heavily fortified Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The explosion of the 18,000 kilogram (40,000¬†lb) Hawthorn Mine underneath the German lines successfully destroyed a major enemy strong point but also served to alert the German forces to the imminent attack. Following the explosion, troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment immediately deployed from their dugouts into the firing line, even preventing the British from taking control of the resulting crater as they had planned. When the assault finally began, the troops from the 86th and 87th Brigade of the 29th British Division were quickly stopped. With the exception of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on the right flank, the initial assault foundered in No Man's Land at, or short of, the German barbed wire. At divisional headquarters, Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle and his staff were trying to unravel the numerous and confusing messages coming back from observation posts, contact aircraft and the two leading brigades. There were indications that some troops had broken into and gone beyond the German first line. In an effort to exploit the perceived break in the German line he ordered the 88th Brigade, which was in reserve, to send forward two battalions to support attack.
At 8:45 a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and 1st Battalion of the Essex Regiment received orders to move forward. The Newfoundland Regiment was situated at St. John's Road, a support trench behind the British forward line and out of sight of the enemy. Movement forward through the communication trenches was not possible because they were congested with dead and wounded men and under shell fire. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, the battalion commander, decided to move immediately into attack formation and advance across the surface, which involved first navigating through the British barbed wire defences. As they breasted the skyline behind the British first line, they were effectively the only troops moving on the battlefield and clearly visible to the German defenders. Subjected to the full force of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment, most of the Newfoundland Regiment who had started forward were dead, dying or wounded within 15 to 20 minutes of leaving St. John's Road trench. Most reached no further than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man's Land that was being utilized as a landmark. So far as can be ascertained, 22 officers and 758 other ranks were directly involved in the advance. Of these, all the officers and slightly under 658 other ranks became casualties. Of the 780 men who went forward only about 110 survived unscathed, of whom only 68 were available for roll call the following day. For all intents and purposes the Newfoundland Regiment had been wiped out, the unit as a whole having suffered a casualty rate of approximately 80%. The only unit to suffer greater casualties during the attack was the 10th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, attacking west of Fricourt village.
The rest of the war.
After July 1916, the Beaumont-Hamel front remained relatively quiet while the Battle of the Somme continued to the south. In the final act in the Somme Offensive, Beaumont-Hamel was assaulted by the 51st (Highland) Division on 13 November 1916 on the opening of the Battle of the Ancre. Within two days, all the 29th Division objectives of 1 July had been taken along with a great many German prisoners. The area of the memorial site then became a rear area with troops lodged in the former German dugouts and a camp was established in the vicinity of the present Y Ravine Cemetery. With the German withdrawal in March 1917 to the Hindenburg Line, about 30 kilometres from Beaumont-Hamel, the battlefield salvage parties moved in, many dugouts were closed off and initial efforts were probably made to restore some of the land to agriculture. However, in March 1918, the German Spring Offensive was here checked on exactly the same battle lines as before. Until the Battle of Amiens and the German withdrawal in late August 1918, the protagonists confronted each other over the same ground, although the only actions were those of routine front line trench raids, patrols and artillery harassment.
History.
In 1921, Newfoundland purchased the ground over which the Newfoundland Regiment made its unsuccessful attack during the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Much of the credit for the establishment of the memorial site is given to Lieutenant Colonel Tom Nangle, the former Roman Catholic Priest of the regiment. As Director of Graves Registration and Enquiry and Newfoundland's representative on the Imperial War Graves Commission he negotiated with some 250 French landowners for the purchase of the site. He also played a leading role in selecting and developing the sites where the Newfoundland memorials currently stand, as well as supervising the construction of each memorial. The memorials, including that at the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site, were constructed for the Government of Newfoundland between 1924 and 1925.
The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site was officially opened, and the memorial unveiled, by Field Marshal Earl Haig on 7 June 1925. Since Newfoundland's confederation with Canada in 1949, the Canadian Government, through the Department of Veterans Affairs, has been responsible for the site's maintenance and care. The site had fallen into some disrepair during the German occupation of France in the Second World War and following confederation the replacement of the original site cabin with a modern building as well as some trench restoration work was undertaken in time for the 45th anniversary of the battle. The memorial site was established as one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada by the then Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps on 10 April 1997.
The Site.
The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site is situated 9 kilometres north of Albert, France near the village of Beaumont-Hamel in an area containing numerous cemeteries and memorials related to the Battle of the Somme. The site is one of the few places on the former Western Front where a visitor can see the trench lines of the First World War and the related terrain in a preserved natural state. It is the largest site dedicated to the memory of the Newfoundland Regiment, the largest battalion memorial on the Western Front, and the largest area of the Somme battlefield that has been preserved.
Although the site was founded to honour the memory of the Newfoundland Regiment, it also contains a number of memorials as well as three cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; that of Y Ravine Cemetery, Hawthorn Ridge No. 2 Cemetery and the unusual mass burial site of Hunter's Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The ever increasing number of visitors to the Memorial has resulted in the authorities taking measures to control access by fencing off certain areas of the former battlefield.
29th Division Memorial.
Near the entrance to site is situated a memorial to the 29th British Division, the division of which the Newfoundland Regiment was a part. Lieutenant-General Beauvoir De Lisle, wartime commander of the 29th British Division, unveiled the monument the morning of the official opening of the site on 7 June 1925. Each wartime unit of the 29th British Division sent a representative to form a guard of honour for the occasion. Afterwards, this detachment, joined by French infantry from Arras formed the honour guard for the unveiling of the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial.
Newfoundland Regiment Memorial.
The memorial is one of six memorials erected by the Government of Newfoundland following the First World War. Five were erected in France and Belgium and the sixth at Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. The memorial is a bronze caribou, the emblem of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, standing atop a cairn of Newfoundland granite facing the former foe with head thrown high in defiance. At the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site the mound rises approximately from ground level. The mounds are also surrounded by native Newfoundland plants. At the base of the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial mound, three bronze tablets carry the names of 820 members of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve, and the Mercantile Marines who gave their lives in the First World War and have no known grave. The memorial is situated close to the headquarters dugout of the 88th Brigade, the brigade of which the Newfoundland Regiment was a part. Sixteen memorial designs were submitted to Nangle for review. He recommended that the government accept British sculptor Basil Gotto‚Äôs plan to erect five identical caribou statues in memory of the regiment. Gotto was already well known in Newfoundland as he had been previously commissioned to execute the statue of the "Fighting Newfoundlander" located in Bowring Park. The landscape architect who designed the sites and supervised their construction, was Rudolph Cochius, a native of the Netherlands living in St. John's. It was decided to plant many of Newfoundland‚Äôs native tree species, such as spruce, dogberry and juniper, along the boundaries of the site. In total, over 5,000 trees were transplanted before the project was completed in 1925. The memorial was unveiled at the official opening of the site by Field Marshal Earl Haig on 7 June 1925. Those that participated or were present included Chief of the French General Staff, Marshal of France Marie √âmile Fayolle, Newfoundland Colonial Secretary John Bennett, Lieutenant Generals Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Beauvoir De Lisle, Major-General D. E. Cayley and former regimental commanding officers Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Lovell and Adolph Ernest Bernard.
51st Division Monument.
Overlooking Y Ravine is the memorial to 51st (Highland) Division. The ground originally donated by the commune of Beaumont-Hamel to the Veterans of the 51st Division was found to be unstable because of the many dugouts beneath it. Lieutenant Colonel Nangle offered a location overlooking Y Ravine within the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site. The Y ravine had been the scene of fierce fighting for the division on 13 November 1916. The selected sculptor for the 51st Division Monument was George Henry Paulin. The base of the monument consists of rough blocks of Rubislaw granite which were produced by Garden & Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland, and are assembled in a pyramid form. Company Sergeant Major Bob Rowan of the Glasgow Highlanders was used as the model for the kilted figure atop the memorial. The figure faces east towards the village of Beaumont-Hamel. On the front is a plaque inscribed in Gaelic: which in English translates as "Friends are good on the day of battle". The 51st Division Monument was unveiled on 28 September 1924 by Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch, the former Allied Supreme Commander. The memorial was rededicated on 13 July 1958, the front panel now referring to not only those who died during the First World War but the Second as well. A wooden Celtic cross directly across the track from the memorial was originally sited at High Wood and subsequently moved to the Newfoundland site. The cross commemorates the men of the 51st Highland Division who fell at High Wood in July 1916.
Danger Tree.
The Danger Tree had been part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had originally been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party in the days before the Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.
Visitors Centre.
There is a Visitors' Centre which exhibits the historical and social circumstances of Newfoundland at the beginning of the 20th century and traces the history of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and some of its personalities. A Memorial room within the Centre houses a copy of the Newfoundland Book of Remembrance, along with a bronze plaque listing the Battle Honours won by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. The centre also incorporates the administrative offices and site archive. Canadian student guides based at the site are available to provide guided tours or explain particular facets of the battlefield and the Newfoundland involvement.
Influence on Newfoundland.
The significance of the events at Beaumont-Hamel on the first day of the Battle of the Somme was perhaps most strongly felt by the Dominion of Newfoundland, as it was the first great conflict experienced by that dominion. Newfoundland was left with a sense of loss that marked an entire generation. The effects on the post-war generation were compounded by chronic financial problems caused both by Newfoundland's large debt from the war, and a prolonged post-war economic recession due to a decline in the fisheries.
Lasting impressions of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who had lost their lives in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourist a year. The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site also serves an informal ambassadorial function, educating visitors not only about the experience of the Newfoundland Regiment but also regarding the history of the island.

Helen's Tower

Helen's Tower lies in the woods of the Clandeboye Estate in Bangor, Northern Ireland. The tower was commissioned by Lord Dufferin of Clandeboye, designed by Scottish architect William Burn and completed in October 1861. The tower was named in honour of Dufferin's mother, Helen Selina Blackwood, the Lady Dufferin.
A close replica of Helen's Tower, the Ulster Tower, was built at Thiepval in 1921 to honour the men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who fell at the Battle of the Somme. Clandeboye Estate was used for army training by the 36th (Ulster) Division during the First World War.
At least two poems have been written with Helen's Tower as the subject; one by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the other by Robert Browning. A verse from Lord Tennyson's poem "Helen's Tower" is reproduced below:
<poem>
Helen's Tower, here I stand,
Dominant over sea and land.
Son‚Äôs love built me, and I hold
Mother‚Äôs love in letter‚Äôd gold.
Love is in and out of time,
I am mortal stone and lime.
Would my granite girth were strong
As either love, to last as long
I should wear my crown entire
To and thro‚Äô the Doomsday fire,
And be found of angel eyes
In earth‚Äôs recurring Paradise.

Cockburn's Port House

Cockburn‚Äôs Port ( ) is a port producer in Portugal. 
It started as a family-owned business and went through 48 years of ownership by various large corporations before returning to private family ownership in 2010 as part of Symington Family Estates.
History.
Cockburn‚Äôs was set up by Scotsman Robert Cockburn in 1815, who returned to Portugal after first visiting the country as a soldier fighting under Wellington in the Napoleonic Wars. It became a major brand of port in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Cockburn‚Äôs is the leading brand of port in the UK, which is the world‚Äôs largest premium port market.
In 1962, the company ceased to be a family-owned business when it was sold to Harvey‚Äôs of Bristol, which itself then became part of Allied Domecq until 2005, when Allied Domecq was taken over by Pernod Ricard, which sold Cockburn's and some other brands to the Fortune Brands holding company (the parent company of Beam Global). In 2010 Cockburn's was sold to Symington Family Estates, a family-owned business that owns over 2,300 acres of vineyards in the Douro valley (by far the largest vineyard holding in this wine region).

Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha

Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha (literally, "the Nakamura descendant of the Takeda school") is a gendai (modern) martial art developed by Nakamura Hisashi in the mid to late 20th century. 
__TOC__
Takeda Ryu history.
The geny≈çsha (society of the Dark Ocean) was originally founded by Hiraoka Kotar≈ç (1851‚Äì1906) and Toyama Mitsuru (1855‚Äì1944), and other former samurai of the Fukuoka domain as the "Koy≈çsha", it agitated for a return to the old feudal order with special privileges and government stipends for the samurai class. The Koy≈çsha participated in the various ex-samurai uprising against the early Meiji government.
In 1881, the Koy≈çsha changed its direction. This time, the declared aims of the Geny≈çsha were honorable and noble: "to honor the Imperial Family, respect the Empire" and "to guard the rights of the people". However the real aim of geny≈çsha was the expansion of Japan.
The first head martial arts teacher of the Genyosha dojo was Takeda Tadakatsu (descendant of Takeda Shingen's father, Takeda Nobutora), and 41st generation of Takeda. In consequence, the martial arts taught at the Genyosha dojo were: Aiki no Jutsu and Ju Jutsu from the Takeda Family, Ken Jutsu (Shinto Ryu), Jo Jutsu (Muso Shinto Ryu, Uchida Ryu), Tessen Jutsu (variation of Ikkaku Ryu jutte jutsu & Isshin Ryu Kusarigama Jutsu).
At Takeda Tadakatsu's death, Nakamura Aikisai Okichi (born Nakamura Yoshitoshi) received the Takeda's Makimono and became the 2nd head martial art teacher of the Genyosha dojo. In 1935, Oba Ichio (Oba Sachiyuki), sponsored by Toyama Mitsuru, became the 3rd head teacher of the Genyosha in Fukuoka prefecture.
After the end of the War and Toyama's death Oba opened the Dojo (1948) to general public and called its teaching "Takeda Ryu". The ryu was established on the basis of several schools in which Oba Ichio had a menkyo kaiden (Takeda family's aiki no jutsu and ju jutsu, Muso Shinto ryu, Kukishin ryu). He was also involved in the Zen Nihon Butoku Kai (formerly Dai Nippon Butoku Kai) in 1930's and he established the Nihon Budo Renren in 1950s.
Takeda Ryu Nakamura-Ha history.
Nakamura Hisashi born the 18th March 1932 in Nagano and went in his aunt home in 1949. He entered in 1950 the Yamagura Dojo of Oba that had been opened to general public for one year. The arts thought by Oba where: Aiki no Jutsu, Ju Jutsu Kenpo, Ken Jutsu, Batto Jutsu, Jo Jutsu, Shugi Jutsu and Shuriken Jutsu.
In 1953 Nakamura Hisashi was accepted as uchi deshi. In 1956, Nakamura Hisashi went to Tokyo to help Oba in the Seibuden dojo in replacement of Moritomo Kazuo.
Oba died in 1959, and appointed Moritomo Kazuo as successor. Moritomo declined the position and appointed Nakamura Hisashi as the next Soke.
Nakamura developed a new way of teaching Aiki no jutsu and called it Aikido (not to be confused with the more common aikido of Morihei Ueshiba).
In 1961, Nakamura established the first Aikido dojo at Rikkyo University (Tokyo) and, in 1962, the second Aikido dojo at Nihon University. In 1963 he established the Japanese Federation for Aikido (Nihon Aikido Renmei). Nakamura believed that randori (free exercises) and shiai (competition) were able to increase physical and mental strength. He organized the first All Japan Aikido Championship (Aiki Yusho Taikai). In 1970, Nakamura changed the name of its organization from Nihon Aikido Renmei to Nihon Sobudo Rengokai. In 1978, Nakamura registered its way of teaching and its budo system as Takeda Ryu Nakamura-Ha.
In 1990, Morimoto Kazuo died, leaving Nakamura as the last teacher of Koryu do Takeda Ryu Bujutsu.
Nowadays, Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha is taught in Japan by Nihon Sobudo Rengokai (NSR) and Worldwide through the International Sobudo Federation which includes but is not limited to :
all under the lead of Nakamura. In Europe, several other groups have split from the original line: Maroto Ha, Kobilza Ha.
Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha Sobudo.
Seven disciplines are taught inside the Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha Sobudo. These disciplines are Aikido, Jukenpo, Iaid≈ç, J≈çd≈ç, Shugijutsu, Tachikendo and Shurikenjutsu.
Techniques are divided in kihon waza (basic techniques), henka waza (variations) and kory≈´ waza (old techniques). The school uses competitions (shiai) and randori as a way of teaching, it is the only way to be close to the true fighting situation. In aikido, the shiai and the randori exist in two different forms. The first one is called "sogo" and the second "tori waza".
In Japanese, "sogo" means integrated. In this form of practice, opponents wear a leather glove (uchi kote) on ONE hand and hit freely with that hand. They are also allowed to throw and to lock. The tori waza is a technical match where opponents take alternatively the role of uke and tori.
Ranking System.
There are two ranking systems in Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha Sobudo, "Kyudaho System" and "Menkyo System".
Kyudaho System (Kyu/Dan ranks).
This ranking system uses colored belts and Dan (rank) black belts.
Menkyo System.
The Menkyo is not a rank, it is a teaching licence delivered by Nakamura to individuals.
Danshinsa (examinations).
Every discipline has particular rules for examination but there are always two steps :

Fr√©d√©ric Lornet is a wine producer who owns and runs the Abbaye de la Bouti√®re in Montigny-l√®s-Arsures; a small village just outside of Arbois in the Franche-Comt√© / Jura region of France.
History.
Arbois, childhood home to Louis Pasteur, has for centuries been the wine capital of the Jura. As the name Abbaye de la Bouti√®re indicates, the winery was established near Arbois in a hoary Roman Catholic Cistercian (White Monk) abbaye.
The Jura is an eastern French winemaking region located between Burgundy and Switzerland - and its location has meant that some unique grape varieties (e.g. the white Savagnin and the reds Poulsard and Trousseau that are used to create highly unusual and rare wines.
Fr√©d√©ric Lornet has been working with this palette and other grape types to make classic versions of French wine using Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapes. One of the rarest wines made at Abbaye de la Bouti√®re is called vin jaune ("Yellow Wine"), which is made from the Savagnin grape (also known locally as "Natur√©"). Abbaye de la Bouti√®re also makes two Blanc de Blanc sparkling wines: "Cremant du Jura" and "Cr√©mant du Jura Ros√©". It also makes pure Savagnin wine and a Ploussard named "L‚ÄôAbbaye" after the ancient Cistercian abbey where they are made. Moreover, Lornet makes a wine from the rare Trousseau grape he calls "Trousseau des Dames", a unique Vin de Paille and some Macvin.
The common Appellations to all the Abbaye de la Bouti√®re wines are: C√¥tes du Jura, C√¥tes du Jura Mousseux and a Cr√©mant du Jura along with more localized Appellation such as : Arbois, Arbois Pupillin, Ch√¢teau Ch√¢lon, L'Etoile, Macvin and Vin de paille (straw wine).

Beluch

Beluch or the Baloch of Turkmenistan are a small part of the greater Baloch people who live primarily in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. They immigrated into the Merv and the Murghab River inland delta from the areas west and north of Herat, Afghanistan and Iran in the mid 19th century. More followed in the early 20th century and closure of the Russian/Soviet borders under Stalin in 1925.
The Mervi Beluch are closely related to those Baloch in Afghanistan and Iran who live nearly the modern borders of Turkmenistan. Today they are the only Iranian people remaining in the Merv Oasia, after the ancient Persian population of the area was deported on mass to Bukhara and Samarkand by the Manghit emir, Shah Murad in the late 1780s. Their fault being their Shia religion. Except for these Baloch, the entire ancient oasis is now Turkified, with the Turkmens forming a vast majority of the population.
Most of the Baloch, however, are losing their linguistic identity, speaking the official language of Turkmenisan, Turkmeni or Russian. A few, however, continue to speak Balochi (and even some Brahui language).
In 1926 the Baluch of Merv Oasis numbered 9,974. Their numbers fell to 7,842 in the official statistics by 1959 but then rose to 12,582 by 1970 and 18,997 by 1979.
The Beluch are Sunni Hanafi Muslims.

Se√°n Herbert

Se√°n Herbert (born 1923 in Ahane, County Limerick) is a retired Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Ahane and with the Limerick senior inter-county team from 1942 until 1953. Herbert is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland medal.
Playing career.
Club.
Herbert played his club hurling with the famous Ahane club in Limerick and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1942 in the company of the legendary Mick Mackey. It was the first of seven county championship victories in-a-row for Herbert and his club. He won an eighth county medal in 1955.
Inter-county.
Herbert‚Äôs performances with his club brought him to the attention of the Limerick selectors. He made his senior debut for the team in 1942, however, Limerick hurling was in the doldrums at the time.
Two years later in 1944 Herbert lined out in his first Munster final. Cork, a team attempting to capture a fourth successive All-Ireland title, provided the opposition. The game was an exciting one with thousands of people walking to the match in Thurles as a result of war-time travel restrictions. The spectators were not disappointed, however, the game ended in a draw ‚Äì Cork 4-13, Limerick 6-7. The replay was just as exciting; however, Cork took a victory on that occasion.
In 1945 Herbert played in his second Munster final. Tipperary were the opponents on that occasion, however, for the second time he ended up on the losing side. Tipp claimed the victory by 4-3 to 2-6.
The year 1946 saw Herbert play in a third provincial decider. Cork, the victors at the same stage two years earlier, provided the opposition once again. Limerick, however, had defeated All-Ireland champions Tipperary in the Munster semi-final and looked a good bet to take the title. Cork had other ideas and easily won the game by 3-8 to 1-3.
In 1947, Herbert tasted his only success with the Limerick team as he captured a National Hurling League medal. Once again his side reached the Muster final as the All-Ireland champions Cork played the League champions. The game was a close affair, however, for the fourth year in-a-row Limerick were defeated.
Two years later in 1949 Herbert was back in his fifth Munster final. Once again it looked as if Limerick might claim the victory. Tipperary were the opponents on this occasion and it was that team that claimed a 1-16 to 2-10 victory. This was Herbert‚Äôs last big occasion with Limerick. He continued playing with his county until 1953.
Provincial.
Herbert also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He captured his first Railway Cup title in 1946 as Munster defeated Ulster. Herbert captured further Railway Cup medals in 1948, 1949, 1952 and 1953.

Middle East Partnership Initiative

The U.S.-Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) is a U.S. State Department program that supports organizations and individuals in their efforts to promote political, economic, and social reform in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). 
MEPI provides direct support to both international and MENA-based NGOs, educational institutions, local governments and private businesses to implement projects designed to directly engage and invest in the people of the MENA region. Through these partnerships, MEPI helps build the capacity of those that serve as the region‚Äôs most successful agents of change - local civil society and business leaders, activists, scholars, students, and lawmakers.
MEPI-supported projects cover a wide range of topics from voter education programs in Egypt, judicial reform seminars in the Persian Gulf, women‚Äôs literacy campaigns in Yemen, and a region-wide partnership program between U.S. and Middle Eastern universities. Two of MEPI‚Äôs most prominent programs are its annual Student Leaders program that brings students from all over the region to participate in a summer-long seminar, and its Middle East Entrepreneur Training program, which assists aspiring young business and civil society leaders.
MEPI‚Äôs budget has been steadily increasing. After initially receiving $29 million, its budget in FY2005 was $75 million. As of 2009, MEPI has granted roughly $530 million to over 600 projects in 17 different countries, including the Palestinian Territories. In support of this Bush Administration's signature program, President Obama continued his support for MEPI and received a requested increase of $86 million from Congress targeted towards the Governing Justly and Democratically (GJD) objective. This program develops civil society in key locations in volatile regions covered by the State Department's Bureau of Near East Affairs(NEA).
History.
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, serving under President George W. Bush, announced the creation of MEPI in a December 2002 speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, declaring that the goal of MEPI was to create ‚Äúa long-term prospect‚Äù for reform, ‚Äúnot something that is going to be done in one year or five years.‚Äù. MEPI was designed to target areas not served by USAID, the United States‚Äô main foreign aid and development program. Initially dependent on USAID in support of its mission, MEPI has come into its own and targets short-term programs addressing political change in order for USAID longer-term development programs to be successful.
In 2002, Elizabeth Cheney, known as Liz, and daughter of Vice-President Dick Cheney, was appointed U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs and tasked with supervising MEPI. Cheney explained that under MEPI, the US administration funded programs as diverse as training Arab journalists to revising current teaching methods from rote learning to more child-oriented teaching methods. Additionally, MEPI supported countries seeking to sign Free Trade Agreements with the United States to meet President Bush‚Äôs goal to establish a joint Middle East Free Trade zone by 2013.
In March 2003, William Joseph Burns, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, U.S. Department of State, and Wendy Chamberlin, Assistant Administrator for Asia and the Near East, U.S. Agency for International Development, testified before the House Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia on the operational aspects of MEPI and how they reflected U.S policy of the War on Terrorism. Rep. Steve Chabot, R- OH and Rep. William Janklow, R-SD, questioned how reforms would be enacted to deal with textbooks that taught Arab children ‚Äúanti-Jewish sentiment‚Äù and ‚Äúracist‚Äù hatred. Burns responded that ‚Äúdetoxification‚Äù would be encouraged by MEPI, particularly in the Palestinian school system. Chamberlin stated that USAID would attempt to address this through teacher training programs. A February 2, 2010, article in the Jerusalem Post reported that a UK watchdog group, The Taxpayer's Alliance, has tracked European taxpayer-funded aid to the Palestinians. In recently released reports, the Alliance found that anti-Semitic and anti-Israel narratives continue to persist in Palestinian textbooks in violation of the 1994 Oslo Accords.
In a November 2003 speech given at the National Endowment for Democracy,also known as the NED, President Bush stressed the need to spread democracy to the Arab and Muslim-majority countries of the Middle East to address the deficits of freedom. Carl Gershman, president of the NED, in his remarks delivered at the December 12, 2003 Conference on Mideast Regional Security V, reinforced President Bush‚Äôs words with his own, ‚ÄúBy any category that is meaningful in the world today, there is only one set of countries that is completely undemocratic: the Arab world.‚Äù Mr. Gershman stated further that ‚Äúdemocracy will not come about if people dwell on the past or are obsessed with blame-placing, but only if they seek practical solutions to real problems. If this is true, it follows that a change in political culture ‚Äì replacing attitudes of victimization with a readiness to engage in self-criticism and to take responsibility for one‚Äôs own fate ‚Äì can only come from within the Arab world.‚Äù MEPI‚Äôs original mandate was to address four deficits in the Arab world identified by the 2002 Arab Human Development Report‚Äîdeficits in political freedom, economic freedom, knowledge, and women's rights. In that same U.N. report, Arab scholars wrote that a choice had to be made between ‚Äòinertia‚Ä¶ an Arab renaissance that will build a prosperous future for all Arabs.‚Äù 
Today, MEPI‚Äôs programs increase the capacity of civil society organizations in the region to advance political participation, foster economic reform, support quality education, and empower women and youth in the Middle East and North Africa, areas identified as critical by President Barack Obama in his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University. MEPI advances the cause of democracy and women‚Äôs rights in the Middle East by promoting female literacy and health programs, as well as business and political training. MEPI can serve as a model for women‚Äôs advocacy programs globally. This U.S. foreign policy, in turn, encourages economic growth, thereby contributing towards the development of democratic institutions and countering extremism. These reforms were accelerated by the Obama administration after the Arab Spring/ Arab awakening in light of the 2011 revolutions.
Organization.
MEPI is located within the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs in the U.S. State Department. In addition to its Washington, D.C. headquarters, MEPI has regional offices in the MENA region.
Public diplomacy.
Soft power, a phrase coined by political theorist and author, Joseph S. Nye, Jr., is used as a complement to America's military strength, or hard power, in a post 9-11 world. Nye believes that by incorporating soft power in U.S. national strategy, America is able to utilize "the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. It arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals, and policies. When our policies are seen as legitimate in the eyes of others, our soft power is enhanced.".
In a June 2007 article for The Stanley Foundation, Francis Fukuyama and Michael McFaul endorsed American soft power as a means to implement democracy in foreign policy, ‚ÄúThe war in Iraq has fostered the false impression that military force is the only instrument of regime change, when in fact it is the rarest used and least effective way to promote democratic change abroad. A wiser, more effective, and more sustainable strategy must emphasize nonmilitary tools aimed at changing the balance of power between democratic forces and autocratic rulers and, only after there has been progress toward democracy, building liberal institutions.‚Äù
Foreign policy.
MEPI‚Äôs gradual, ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù public diplomacy approach is a process to create conditions where the pressure for change will come from Arabs themselves. A rapid transition to democracy risks destabilizing autocratic regimes and unintentionally empowering anti-U.S. Islamists who would exploit their position to oppose the existing regime. Critics of this rationalization have suggested that autocrats in some cases, like Egypt, inflate those fears as a way to maintain their power.
MEPI's small grant programs are part of routine embassy efforts by U.S. political officers to connect with activists in the region to further effect democratic reform and support human rights. In 2008, MEPI issued a grant to the Maccabim program, a community service project serving inner-city, at-risk youth in the impoverished Israeli Arab neighborhood of Lod, Israel. The program, endorsed by the Lod Municipality, provides soccer training, warm meals, tutoring, and counseling for neighborhood children. Asaf Toledano, Maccabim Program Director, noted that since the area had been plagued by violence and drug dealers, the Tel Aviv police department approached Maccabim to establish the community service project in 2005. Today the program includes 225 children, 3 schools and a staff of 30, including soccer coaches and coordinator. The U.S. Embassy‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Mission, Luis G. Moreno, praised the program at a 2009 festive soccer match between the police department and neighborhood teams.
One of MEPI‚Äôs pillars is women‚Äôs empowerment. In a March 13, 2010, U.N. speech, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an international women‚Äôs conference of more than 2,000 women activists, ‚ÄúThe subjugation of women is a direct threat to the security of the United States. The status of the world‚Äôs women is not only a matter of justice. It is also a political, economic, and social imperative.‚Äù Secretary Clinton stated that this principle was at the heart of U.S. foreign policy.
On September 25, 2009, the State Department announced a pilot program where MEPI will be soliciting proposals from five organizations that will be awarded between $500,000 and $2.5 million for the expansion of social network technologies for new media capabilities in the Middle East. As part of Secretary of State Clinton's efforts to connect young people in closed socieities for greater involvement in civic participation and open political discussions online, she stated, "We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas."
In the War of ideas, there are risks to online activism in authoritarian regimes because countries that receive U.S. aid, like Egypt, have detained and jailed the bloggers and online activists like Ahmed Maher, who try to hold their government accountable. Expectations about how effective social networking is in encouraging political change is part of the global conversation the State Department is promoting. Although global connectivity can be dangerous for activists in closed societies, the most significant change is in the realm of public sphere bloggers who write about social issues that change their expectations about the societies where they live. MEPI's investment in promoting greater connectivity in the Middle East can shift the status quo through this more sophisticated, long-lasting approach supporting activists in authoritarian regimes.
Critics.
Critics have charged that MEPI hinders reform by working too closely within the limitations set by the Arab governments in the regions it serves. MEPI has addressed these concerns through its small grants programs shifting away from Arab government agencies to work directly with civil society activists.
MEPI critics in the Arab world saw the initiative as the U.S. means to impose reforms on the Middle East following 9-11 and complained that the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Arab territories and the U.S. occupation in Iraq needed to be resolved before reforms could be introduced. Liz Cheney refuted those critics by stating that the U.S. administration believed without reform, the region would continue to generate ‚Äúideologies of hate and violence.‚Äù Cheney believed that reforms as well as resolutions to regional issues could occur concurrently. Economic and political reforms would have an impact on molding the future of the Middle East. Cheney offered that court systems needed to be reformed in order to instill investor confidence in the region.
Although there is increasing debate over the need for Arab countries to reform politically and economically, most of these Arab countries are suspicious when such reform is called for by the U.S. government. Thomas Carothers, an authority on democracy promotion at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested in February 2005, that MEPI should be reestablished as the Middle East Foundation (MEF), a private foundation that would be eligible for funding in a line-item grant in the foreign affairs account of the federal budget. If freed from the constraints of an aid program affiliated with the State Department, Carothers argued, such a foundation would enjoy the autonomy necessary to develop political reform projects that would be viewed as separate from the U.S. government. Moreover, it would be more likely that MEPI would increase the possibility of attracting funding from sources outside the U.S. government.

Career.
Career beginnings: 2000‚Äì2005.
Jonas's career started when he was discovered at the age of six in a barber shop, while his mother was getting her hair cut and was referred to a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, he began performing on Broadway. He had acted in several plays, including "A Christmas Carol" (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), "Annie Get Your Gun" (in 2001 as Little Jake), "Beauty and the Beast" (in 2002 as Chip), and "Les Mis√©rables" (in 2003 as Gavroche). After "Les Mis√©rables" closed, he performed in "The Sound of Music" (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.
In 2002, while performing in "Beauty and the Beast", Jonas wrote a song with his father called "Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)." With background vocals from the "Beauty and the Beast" cast, Nick recorded the song on the 2002 annual Broadway "Equity Fights AIDS" album, "Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4". In November 2003, INO Records received a demo copy of "Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)". The label released the song to Christian radio, where it quickly became popular on Record & Radio's Christian Adult Contemporary Chart.

A second single, "Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)" (a re-recorded version), was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album "Nicholas Jonas", but the album was pushed back. It did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with his brothers, Kevin and Joe, co-wrote songs for the album. In early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, heard Jonas' record.

"It's About Time", the brothers' first album was released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a "limited release" of a little over 50,000 copies. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers considered switching labels. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.
After shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. Their self-titled second album, "Jonas Brothers", was released on August 7, 2007.

I'm building what Demi wanted, which is a show without stops and starts. Demi and I have the same manager, so I was immediately excited when I was offered the position. The relationship that Demi and I had over eight years really gives me the insight into how to best communicate with her and her team."I've been in rehearsals with the band for the last two weeks. The biggest challenge has been just trying to rethink some of the music and see how we could compliment it with lights and video. I sat down with the band and said to them, 'You need to step into this like it's a new gig. None of these arrangements are going to sound like the originals, so you need to have an open mind.'"

John Tyson Wigan

Brigadier-General John Tyson Wigan, CB, CMG, DSO (July, 1872 ‚Äì November, 1952) was a senior British Army officer with the Desert Mounted Corps during World War I who was wounded in action three times during campaigning at the Battle of Gallipoli and during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. He had previously been badly wounded in the Second Boer War and following his retirement from the army post-war became a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party.
Life.
John Wigan was born in 1872 in West Hartlepool and educated at Rugby School before joining the British Army in 1897 with the 13th Hussars. Within two years, Wigan had been deployed to South Africa during the Second Boer War, in which he was seriously wounded. In 1909, Wigan retired from the regular army and transferred to the Territorial Army with the Bedfordshire Yeomanry. This force was activated at the outbreak of World War I and sent to the Mediterranean.
Wigan was seriously wounded in 1915 during the Battle of Gallipoli, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order the following year in acknowledgement of his service. The Bedfordshire Yeomanry moved to Egypt in 1916 and in April 1917 Wigan was again wounded at the Second Battle of Gaza. In July 1917, Wigan was advanced to command the 7th Mounted Brigade which included Australian troops and in the November of 1917 this force was deployed in the Third Battle of Gaza at which Wigan was wounded for a fourth time in an attack on Turkish trenchlines.
In 1918 Wigan was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in recognition of his service and in 1919 a Companion of the Order of the Bath. At the end of the war, the yeomanry was decommissioned and Wigan entered politics as MP for Abingdon. In 1921 Wigan gave up his seat and retired, later serving as High Sheriff of Essex in 1930. Wigan died in Cuckfield, West Sussex in November 1952.

Elonex ONEt

The Elonex ONEt is a netbook computer marketed to the education sector in the UK by Elonex. Inspired by the OLPC initiative, the low cost of the ONE, the ONEt and similar devices, made this subnotebook seem an attractive proposition for educators seeking to provide every child with a highly functional laptop computer. However initial ONEt trials by educators claimed that the lack of security, specifically the absence of any password protection at start-up, put personal information at risk, making it unsuitable for use in a school environment. It was released in September 2008, on sale to the general public, marketed as an upgrade to the ONE. It has Wi-Fi connectivity, a solid-state hard drive, three USB ports and an SD card slot.
Hardware.
The hardware specifications published on 9 July 2008:
Operating System.
The Elonex OneT has a Linux (mipsel) based operating system, and the included software comprises Sky Word (Abiword 2.4.5), Sky Table (Gnumeric 1.6.3), a PDF viewer (ePDFView 0.1.6), Scientific Calculator, Dictionary, File Manager, Web Browser (BonEcho/Firefox), Email client (Sylpheed), Sky Chatting (Pidgin), FBReader, Media Player (xine based), Xip Flash Player, Image Gallery, Paint Brush, and Sound Recorder.
Although access to the root filing system isn't possible through the included file manager it is possible to get console access as user root by installing the Xterm application from the CnM Lifestyle website. The CnM Lifestyle notebook is exactly the same as the Elonex OneT and so all applications on this page can be installed.
Similar devices.
The ONEt is similar to the CnM Mini-book from Maplin Electronics, Alpha 400 product from Bestlink or the Trendtac EPC 700 or the Skytone Alpha 400. Those devices are basically all the same and only have different OEM names.

Canal Roeselare‚ÄìLeie

The canal Roeselare-Leie is an artificial waterway between the town Roeselare and the river Leie.
It can handle barges up to 1350 tonnes.
The port in Roeselare, at the start of the canal Roeselare-Leie, is mainly characterized by a thriving industrial activity. Well-known companies that are located there include Debailli√© and Hanekop, both producers of animal food. Soubry, the well-known dough manufacturer, also has an establishment there.
The Roeselare port covers an area of 40 hectares and is easily accessible by road. Nearby is the A17/E403 highway Bruges-Kortrijk with many opportunities to explore the coast, the inland of the Belgian-French and Belgian-Dutch border regions. The disclosure in Roeselare is also good with the Mandel Avenue that can be used to access the industrial zone in Beveren. It is also easy to choose driving through the King Albert I Avenue until the Inner Ring road to the Great Ring N36/R32. The canal connects Roeselare with the ports of Dunkirk, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels and Liege, via the Leie.
Following the canal from Roeselare City, one passes first the town of Izegem where the food company Vandemoortele Groep is located, then Ingelmunster and Oostrozebeke, and finally Ooigem, a municipality of Wielsbeke where the canal joins the Leie. There is a lock to overcome a height of 7.50 meters. The Kortrijk-Bruges railway line runs a few kilometers parallel to the canal. There is a proposal to build a container terminal for temporary container storage alongside the canal.
The Leiestreek tourist office and the municipality are working on a project to give the canal and the green area around it a recreational function. For example, during the summer there are already boat cruises. The banks of the canal are also frequented by fishermen.
The piece of the canal between Roeselare port and the town is an ideal backdrop for street theater and cultural events, such as the annual happening "De Groote Stooringe".

The Time of the Doves

The Time Of The Doves (also translated as "The Pigeon Girl" or "In Diamond Square"; original Catalan-language: "La pla√ßa del diamant", that is "Diamond Square") is a 1962 novel written by exiled Catalan writer Merc√® Rodoreda. It is noted by its use of stream of consciousness. The book is named after a square in Barcelona's district of Gr√†cia. It's featured in Harold Bloom's "The Western Canon" as part of the list of canonical books of the "Chaotic Age". Arguably the author's most accomplished work, the novel has been translated into more than thirty languages and is regarded as one of the most important pieces of fiction in contemporary Catalan literature. It's also one of the staple readings in secondary school programs across Catalonia. 
Dealing with the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War, the novel is set in Barcelona before, during and after the war and pictures a young woman's struggles in life as well as her conflictive relationships with two men, and her progression from nearly complete submission until she develops a full-fledged outlook in life, personal maturity and independence. It's also a faithful chronicle of life in the city at the time, in a balanced mixture of psychologism and naturalism.
Adaptations.
It was made into a film in 1982 directed by Francesc Betriu, and has spawned several theatre adaptations, including a play directed by Joan Oll√© in 2004.

Patapon 2

The game was released in Japan, Europe, and Australia before North America, and in North America it was first available only as a digital download via the PlayStation Store, as a "test case" to gauge the success of digital distribution on the PSP. The game is now available on UMD in all regions.
It hosts a four player ad hoc multiplayer mode. A bundle has been released. It includes a silver PSP-3000 along with a 32GB MemoryStick, and the UMD version of "Patapon 2". It was released in stores November 27 in Japan.
A sequel titled Patapon 3 was released on April 12, 2011 in North America, April 15, 2011 in Europe and on April 28, 2011 in Japan.
Plot.
The story continues from the previous game. The ship the Patapons and Zigotons have constructed has been finally completed and they have set sail for new lands. On their way there, they are attacked by a kraken who easily defeats them and sends the Patapons into the ocean to be washed ashore in a strange new land (which is actually and originally their homeland, the Patapolis) where they come up against another tribe called the Karmen. Now it is a battle to defeat the Karmen and find out who is their true enemy. Early in the game, the Patapons discover the mysterious "Hero", who wears a mask which boosts his abilities. He has lost his memory, and his true identity is forgotten, hidden and unknown. Later, the Patapons fight against the Akumapons, and the "Dark One" (actually this is Makoton, the Zigoton that was killed in the first game with Baban, and now was reincarnated), who gave his soul to the demons for power. Gong the Hawkeye and his fellow Zigotons appear once more, to assist the Patapons against the Karmen.
During the course of a game, the player learns of a legend, that the world was broken and the Patapons ruined because a Wakapon broke the "World Egg". At the second to last stage, the player finds out that the Hero was actually the Wakapon who broke the egg, and that the Karmen tribe was the Patapon's ancestral enemy, knowing them as the ones who overtook the Patapon Ancients. The Patapon Princess was trapped inside an egg by Ormen Karmen, the leader of the Karmens, who plans to make the Princess his queen.
After defeating the demon Dettankarmen that the Karmens summoned, the Patapons journey to the end of a bridge, only to find and break an egg. Dazzled by the bright light that emerges from the egg, the Patapons assume they have found "IT" at Earthend, which they have been searching since the first game. However, the Patapon Princess emerges from the egg, compliments them on their job well done, and tells the Hero that he has a new task - to restore the world and find the true Earthend.
At the end of the game, the Patapons are seen working with the Karmen and Zigotons to fix the bridge that will lead them to the other side of the land.
Characters.
Rob Smith writes that new "characters such as the bird-riding Toripon, the Robopon with huge fists, and the magic-using Mahopon provide fresh attack types and original personalities for your almighty ruler to manage." In an interview attached to the same article, Hiroyuki Kotani adds that all "the new characters ended up... attractive from a fundamental gameplay standpoint, so I picked the ones I liked the most." When asked, "From all the characters...is any one of them your personal favorite?" Kotani answered,"I love Gong, the leader of the Zigotons. In fact, I love him so much you can probably expect to see him in "Patapon 2"."
Gameplay.
The core gameply of Patapon 2 is almost identical to its predecessor. It is a video game that the player controls in a manner similar to rhythm games. The player is put in direct control of a tribe of Patapon warriors; to command the warriors, the player inputs specific sequences using the face buttons on the PSP, each representing a "talking drum", in time to a drum rhythm. These sequences order the tribe to move forward on the linear battlefield, attack, defend, and other actions. If the player inputs an unknown sequence or enters them off the main rhythm, the tribe will become confused and stop whatever they are doing. However, repeatedly entering a proper sequence in sync with the rhythm will lead the tribe into a "Fever" increasing their attack and defensive bonuses. The tribe will stop doing anything after performing the last entered command if the player does not enter any more commands. For example, some commands are square, square, square, circle (Pata, Pata, Pata, Pon.), which has them march forward and circle, circle, square, circle (Pon, Pon, Pata, Pon.), which makes them attack.
The game is divided into several missions. Prior to each mission, the player can recruit new troops and assemble formations, equip troops with weapons and armor gained from the spoils of war or crafted from certain minigames. The player can return to an earlier mission to acquire additional resources and equipment to build up their troops before a larger battle.
Units.
A notable change is the inclusion of three new units for each group and another way to access new patapon classes. Another change is the evolutionary tree. To access different Patapon classes, they need to reach certain points in the tree, some not available until later parts of the game. Also Rarepon can be made without sacrificing Patapon to make space for newer ones. To maintain incentive for collecting items, there is an abundant amount of classes of Patapon to rely upon, some Patapon such as the "Pyokoran" Rarepon being nimble in battle as well as being immune to freezing but are vulnerable to fire damage. Another change is that a Patapon can level up by using more material with effects amplifying at every 5 level to maximum of 10.
The most notable change is the Heropon, a hero unit which can adopt the persona of any class of their choice with a powerful special attack to deliver to unsuspecting foes. You can change their masks for different stats, like elemental resistance or attack speed. They also can be revived but takes longer to revive with each death. In addition, if Hatapon is alone while the Heropon is reviving, the mission ends. Each "Hero" persona also has a special move that can only be activated in Fever mode and must have perfect beat. This special ability shows a spirit above him and allows him to have a special damage effect on opponents like: The Iron Fist (Yaripon), Broken Arrow (Yumipon).
Multiplayer.
"Patapon" designer Hiroyuki Kotani has revealed that the multiplayer mode stems from the single-player mode, the former of which will involve giant eggs. These eggs contain Masks for the Hero Patapon to wear, or new CPU Kumopons. To hatch the eggs, four players must defend the egg on an enemy-laden multiplayer battleground, while moving it to a special egg-hatching altar. At this altar, all players must perform a hatching ceremony, which involves playing their rhythms in synchronization to crack the egg.
Patapon 2: Art of War.
Patapon 2: Art of War is a Flash game created by Rolito and Interlink to promote the Patapon 2 game. It was playable til the release of Patapon 3 on the patapon-game.com website. 
Release and reception.
To test the market for digital distribution of games, Sony Computer Entertainment America released "Patapon 2" as a "test case" digital download through the PlayStation Store for North America only, leaving the Latin American market out of their strategy. A voucher for the game is available for retail purchase. In all other regions, now including North America, the game is available on UMD.
GamePro's Heather Bartron called the game a "must-have title for PSP owners," rating it a 4.5 out of 5 stars and praising it as an improved sequel to the already enjoyable and addictive "Patapon". Bartron wrote that both titles have great visual style though "Patapon 2" has limited multiplayer modes and "needs more songs." "Hyper"'s Tracey Lien commends the game for being "exactly the same as the first "Patapon", which is good because the original was really rad".
