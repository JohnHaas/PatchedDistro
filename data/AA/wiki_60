Oda Suemaru

Viscount was the fourth daimyo of the "tozama" feudal domain of Tendō, in Dewa province, northern Japan. Oda Suemaru was a direct descendant of Oda Nobunaga, through Nobunaga's son Oda Nobukatsu.
Biography.
Suemaru was born as the sixth son of Oda Nobumichi (the 2nd Lord Tendō).
He was still in an infant when his brother, Oda Nobutoshi (the 3rd Lord Tendō) was placed under house arrest and ordered to retire due to his involvement in the "Ouetsu Reppan Domei" of northern domains against the Meiji government during the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration in December 1868. Nobutoshi was allowed to return to Tendō in July 1869. However, in the interim, the title of daimyo had been replaced by “domain governor” by the new government. Soon after Nobutoshi's return to Tendō, he replaced Suemaru as governor and final lord of Tendō.
Suemaru died at the age of six, and his grave is at the Buddhist temple of Korin-ji in Bunkyō, Tokyo.

Usta (Norway)

Usta or Usteåne is a river in Hol, Buskerud County, Norway. It flows from Lake Ustevatn traveling northeast down the valley of Ustedalen to its confluence with Holselva. The ski resort at Geilo is situated just north of the river, about halfway down Ustedalen valley. The valley stretches about 20 km east from Ustevatn and meetings Holsdalføret below Hagafoss.
In 1965 almost all the waters of the Usta was diverted due to the construction of Usta Hydroelectric Power Station. The power station uses the fall in the river Usta of 540 meters from Ustevatn and Rødungen. The power plant is owned and operated by E-CO Energi. The total average annual production at the plant is 780 GWh. Today the lower river is mostly a dry riverbed.

Pyotr Kuzmich Pakhtusov () (1800, Kronstadt - November 19, 1835, Arkhangelsk) was a Russian surveyor and Arctic explorer. He is credited with the first thorough survey of Novaya Zemlya.
Between 1832 and 1835 Pakhtusov undertook two exploratory journeys to Novaya Zemlya. He wintered on the island on the two occasions and took detailed meteorological observations. 
Pakhtusov carefully surveyed the southern and eastern parts of Novaya Zemlya along with fellow explorer and cartographer Avgust Tsivolko during the last two years of the expedition. Thanks to their work the first reliable maps of Novaya Zemlya's southern shores and part of the northern island's coastline, were published.
A small island in the eastern shore of Novaya Zemlya and a group of islands in the Nordenskiöld Archipelago are named after Pyotr Kuzmich Pakhtusov.
His feat as a scientist and researcher was immortalized in 1886. Colleagues of Pakhtusov and expedition members had initiated the creation of this monument in Kronstadt.

Public transport in Tallinn

Public transport in Tallinn consists of bus, tram, trolleybus, train and ferry services. Bus routes are mainly operated by Tallinna Autobussikoondis (TAK), but since 1995 MRP Linna Liinid is also operating some lines. All trams and trolleys are operated by Tallinna Trammi- ja Trollibussikoondis (TTTK). Electric train services are offered by Elron_(rail_transit) and the ferry service to Aegna island is operated by Lindaliini AS under trademark "Linda Line". 
Only buses, trams and trolleys belong to the unified ticket system, trains and ferries have their own ticket rates.
Today, Tallinn is the only city in Estonia ever to have trams or trolleybuses. The first tram route was opened in 1888, and in 2008 the tram celebrated its 120th anniversary. Trolleybuses were planned in Tallinn already in 1946, but the first route was opened 1965. Since then, 9 trolleybus routes have been opened, yet one was closed in 2000 and another in 2012, leaving only 7 lines.
A light rail service in Tallinn has been planned since the 1970s. The project was stopped when Estonia became independent from the Soviet Union, but in the 2000s the planning has continued. The light rail would start in the city center, usually at Vabaduse väljak (Freedom Square) or Viru keskus (Viru shopping center) and finish in East Lasnamäe, having 10–12 stations.
All trains depart from the Balti jaam just at the northern end of Tallinn's Old City. Elektriraudtee offers local EMU services to Keila, Paldiski and Riisipere in the west and Aegviidu in the east. Edelaraudtee offers DMU services to Pärnu, Viljandi, Tartu and Narva. Currently Elektriraudtee has fairly old trains, but they've promised to renew their whole trainpark in 2013.
Systems.
Bus.
Internal.
Bus routes can be found almost everywhere in Tallinn. Nearly everywhere, especially in Pirita, Lasnamäe and Nõmme they provide the backbone of the public transportation system, as these districts don't have trams or trolleybuses (except Nõmme, through which the Elektriraudtee western direction trains go).
The routes and timetables are set by Tallinna Transpordiamet (Tallinn Department of Transportation), but are given to either TAK or MRP to service. The contracts are renewed every 5 years.
The route numbers in Tallinn consist of one or two numbers, occasionally accompanied by a letter A or B. There has also been a special Park & Ride bus route 1PR, which was opened in September 2007 and offered service between the Pirita Park & Ride parking lot and the city center. The route was closed from January 2009.
Nearly all routes have two terminus stops, one of which serves to drivers also as a resting stop.
Tallinn doesn't have much "feeder lines", which take passengers to another means of transport. Currently, only bus route no. 57 has been shortened to a tram terminus.
Routes are mostly operated between 5:30 and 0:00 throughout the day. Some bus routes, mainly the express routes operate only during peak hours and have a break between 10–11 in the morning and 2–3 in the afternoon. From September 1, 2012, express routes will have the same ticket price as regular bus routes.
From November 7 until the end of 2008 the Department of Transport carried out a pilot project, during which popular bus and trolleybus routes' operating times were prolonged until 1 am.
Since January 1, 2013 all public transport has been free of charge for people registered as living in Tallinn.
Regional.
Regional bus routes are managed by the Harjumaa Ühistranspordikeskus (HÜTK) (Harju County Public Transportation Center). The Center was established in early 2005. The establishers were the 25 local governments of Harjumaa and the Government of the Harju County as the representative of the Republic of Estonia. The goal of the center is to arrange public transportation in Harju County to raise quality of the service provided. The routes are drawn by HÜTK and then given to different operators. There are also about 50 commercial lines in Harju County.
As of November 1, 2008, a zone system was introduced for public suburban routes. Harju County is divided to 4 zones, with the first one being Tallinn, second the surroundings of Tallinn and the rest are determined by the distance from Tallinn. Travelling within a zone will cost 12 EEK, and driving to another zone will cost an extra 10 EEK. The zone system replaces the current ticketing system, where the cost was determined by the distance driven - for example, if a route passes through a lot of villages instead taking a shortcut using the highway, the ticket would cost more.
<br clear=all>
Tram.
The tram network is fairly short and serves the city centre with its surrounding areas. There are 4 tram lines and two types of trams - Tatra KT4 and KT6, which basically is a KT4 with a lowered middle-section.
The tram system is operated by TTTK.
Trolleybus.
Trolleybuses serve the western part of Tallinn, Mustamäe and Haabersti districts especially. Trolleybus service began in 1965 with a route from the Estonian National Opera "Estonia" to Hipodroom (Hippodrome). Currently there are 7 routes: 1,3,4 and 5 from city center to Mustamäe, 6 and 7 to Õismäe and 9 from Mustamäe to Kopli. On December 1, 2012 trolleybus lane nr 2 was replaced by diesel buses.
Commuter train.
The Elektriraudtee commuter trains are especially meant for the Harju County residents for a connection to Tallinn. The western routes are also used by the Nõmme district residents. Elektriraudtee has promised to renew the fleet by July 2013.
Ferry.
Tallinn has a ferry connection to Aegna island, operated by Lindaliini AS. Since Aegna doesn't have many residents, the ferry is mostly for tourists and is operated only summertime.
Tickets.
All Tallinn bus, tram and trolleybus routes belong to a unified ticket system. Harju County routes and commuter trains (Elektriraudtee, Ededlaraudtee) have a different fare system, which depends on the distance traveled.
Ticket types.
Single tickets (talong) can be bought from vehicle drivers for 1.60 eur. 
Registered residents of Tallinn who have their ID cards and the Public Transport Card ("Ühiskaart") can travel free of charge on buses, trams and trolley buses in Tallinn from 1 January 2013.
Non-residents can use the travel card for loading cash for single tickets, different period tickets etc.
Ticket prices.
Ticket prices above are for Tallinn residents; non-resident fares and fares for paper-based tickets are higher. All ticket prices can be found at the Tallinn.ee website. Discount tickets are eligible to use for students, pensioners and disabled people. Anyone under the age of 7 or over 65 may ride for free. Also passengers with kids under 3 years of age can ride for free.
In a public opinion poll on March 25, 2012, over 75% of the participants answered "yes" for fare-free transit on Tallinn's public transport system. Public transport has been fare-free for Tallinn residents since January 1, 2013, making Tallinn the first European capital abolishing fares for city residents.
Fare collection.
In Tallinn, in most vehicles you can enter the vehicle from any door. As of July 2008, Tallinn Municipal Police ticket controllers check tickets occasionally, stopping the vehicle between two stops so no-one can leave the vehicle unnoticed. A penalty fee (maximum of 40 €) is charged to any passenger without a valid ticket. If a passenger has forgotten his/her ID-card, then he/she can tell the ticket controller his/her social security number, which, in case the person has a valid ticket, proves the right of travelling. Since 1 January 2013, fare-free travellers (except those who could travel for before) have to validate their Public Transport Card and can be fined 40 euros in case you have not either validated their card and/or fail to prove their ID.

Nantucket series

The Nantucket series (also known as the Nantucket trilogy or the Islander trilogy) is a set of alternate history novels written by S. M. Stirling. The novels focus on the island of Nantucket which was transported back in time to 1250 BC due to something called "The Event". Shortly thereafter a conflict develops between the democratic Republic of Nantucket and a group of renegade Americans led by the ex-Coast Guard lieutenant William Walker. The series was nominated for the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 2000.
Background.
In the three novels of the Nantucket series, a cosmic disturbance characterized by an elliptical dome of fire (called "The Event" in the series) transports the island of Nantucket and its inhabitants back in time into the Bronze Age. The world of circa 1250 BC, which corresponds to the late Heroic Age of Greek mythology, is populated by a large variety of hunting, nomadic and agricultural people, as well as well-documented Bronze Age cultures including Ancient Egypt, the Hittites, and Mycenaean Greece. 
The trilogy describes the day-to-day problems of adaptation and survival and the emotional and social trauma of losing connection with the modern world. Much of the plot deals with ongoing conflicts between the different factions of the island's population. Some Nantucket residents wish to dominate the world for their own benefit, others wish to interact with local populations through trade and cultural development, while most just want to survive, work hard, and claw their way back to something approaching their pre-Event way of life. 
They have the extreme good luck that, transported in time together with island, is a US Coast Guard sailing ship captained by a tough, experienced Coast Guard captain, who provides leadership for Nantucket's armed forces. (She insists upon using the term "Coast Guard" rather than "Navy", though what she eventually builds up is a worldwide naval force). 
However, also transported back with the ship is the ambitious and totally unscrupulous young lieutenant William Walker, who seizes the opportunity to form a band of renegades, flee the island to live like gods amongst the Bronze Age peoples of Europe and the Middle East. Walker—who, unfortunately, is as smart as he is callous—exploits the 'magic' of gunpowder and iron-forging to build up an empire of his own, one that he believes will inevitably conquer and enslave the entire world. 
Therefore, as the series progresses, it becomes clear to Nantucket's scaled-down Government that sitting back and reinventing isolationism is no real option, and that the people of Nantucket have no choice but build an army, a navy, and a set of foreign alliances of their own and take the fight to Walker - and in the process, build up what amounts to an empire of their own. 
By the end of the third book, Nantucket is the dominant member of a sizable and expanding network of allies, rather reminiscent of the British Empire (though Britain itself is called "Alba" in the novel, one of Nantucket's protectorates and a source of "warrior tribes" to be enrolled as mercenaries in its armies), and the Nantucketars ("Eagle-People", "Islanders", "Nan-Tukh-Tar", etc.) seem well on their way to re-enacting the United States’ Manifest Destiny three thousand years early, with Native Americans succumbing to disease and becoming virtually extinct on Long Island and the Nantuckers setting out on transcontinental expeditions and reaching California by sea, as well as starting to settle what corresponds to Argentina. 
Nantucket has 'Outport' colonies spanning the globe, with bases in the Caribbean, Argentina, the Azores, South Africa, Zanzibar, Madagascar, Mauritius, Bombay, etc.; basically, anywhere there is a good harbor situated close to existing or future trading routes, the Republic is on the scene. The Alban Alliance rules the British Isles where Walker initially tried to carve out a kingdom, and are a close ally, a source of labor and military recruits, and, as its people absorb more of the New Learning, look like being at the heart of a very early Industrial Revolution. Babylon, Hittite Empire and Mitanni (a vassal of Babylon), are also allies. At the end of the third book, these allies are already laying plans for carving up the Caucasus and Persia between them.
Connections to the Emberverse series.
Stirling has confirmed that "The Emberverse series" is connected to the Nantucket series. Evidence of this is apparent throughout the novels, for more information, see here.

The current ASD(PA) is Douglas B. Wilson, who previously served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs under former Secretary William S. Cohen. 
The ASD (PA) is the principal but not the sole spokesperson for the Department. In July 2011, the ASD (PA) announced the appointment of two additional spokespersons for the Department. George E. Little, one of two "Deputy Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Public Affairs", serves concurrently as the "Pentagon Press Secretary". Navy Captain John Kirby, former spokesman for Admiral Michael Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now serves as "Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Media Operations and Spokesman". Both Little and Kirby serve as spokesmen for the Secretary of Defense and for the Department.

The ASD(PA) is supported by the following divisions: 
History.
This position was originally established as the "Assistant to the Secretary (Director, Office of Public Information)" by Secretary James V. Forrestal in July 1948. After Reorganization Plan No.6 of 30 June 1953 increased the number of assistant secretaries, Defense Directive 5122.1 of September 1953 redesignated the post as "Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative and Public Affairs)" 
This position was abolished in February 1957, and functions were divided between two new posts, the "Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs)" and an "Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs)". ASD(PA) was established by Defense Directive 5105.13 of 10 August 1957.
In 1993, the position was changed to "Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs," by Defense Directive 5122.5. This bureaucratic distinction was dropped after the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 (P.L. 103-337) increased the number of assistant secretaries from 10 to 11. Today, the post is titled "Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs)", referred to as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and abbreviated as ASD(PA).

List of Australians who have led the Tour de France general classification

Since the establishment of the competition in 1903, six Australians have led the general classification in the Tour de France at the end of a stage during one of the 100 Tours de France. 
One of the three Grand Tours of professional stage cycling, the Tour de France is the most famous road cycling event in the world, and is held annually in the month of July. Although all riders compete together, the winners of the Tour are divided into classifications, each best known by the coloured jersey that is worn by the leader of it; the general classification (GC), represented by the "maillot jaune" (yellow jersey), is for the overall leader in terms of the lowest time. The other individual classifications in the Tour de France are the points classification, also known as the sprinters' classification (green jersey), the mountains classification (polka dot jersey), and the young rider classification (white jersey).
In the 100 editions of the Tour de France to 2013, only six Australian riders have worn the "maillot jaune". The first was Phil Anderson, who in 1981 became the first ever non-European to lead the general classification at the Tour de France when he wore the yellow jersey on Stage 7 on 1 July. Of the six Australians to wear it to date, only two are considered to be "general classification riders" (that is, riders who are aiming to win the GC, as opposed to competing in another classification or riding as a "domestique"): Anderson in 1981 and 1982 and Cadel Evans in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Stuart O'Grady and Robbie McEwen are sprint specialists, and were successful in the points classification competition in the years when they also wore the yellow jersey; as a result of winning stages early in the race, they received time bonuses which gave them the leadership of the GC for a small number of days early in the Tour. Brad McGee, the other Australian to have led the general classification, was the reigning world champion in the 4000 m individual pursuit when he won the opening prologue time trial, which was similar in length, in 2003. Simon Gerrans gained his Yellow Jersey after Orica-GreenEDGE's victory in the Team Time Trial around Nice.
The six Australians have spent a total of 31 stages in the "maillot jaune" out of the 2,125 total in the 100 editions of the Tour de France, as at the end of Stage 4 of the 2013 Tour.

Wound rotor motor

A wound-rotor motor is a type of induction motor where the rotor windings are connected through slip rings to external resistances. Adjusting the resistance allows control of the speed/torque characteristic of the motor. Wound-rotor motors can be started with low inrush current, by inserting high resistance into the rotor circuit; as the motor accelerates, the resistance can be decreased. 
Compared to a squirrel-cage rotor, the rotor of the slip ring motor has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, and the current lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength in the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher start-up torque. 
A wound-rotor motor can be used in several forms of adjustable-speed drive. Certain types of variable-speed drives recover slip-frequency power from the rotor circuit and feed it back to the supply, allowing wide speed range with high energy efficiency. Doubly fed electric machines use the slip rings to supply external power to the rotor circuit, allowing wide-range speed control. Today speed control by use of slip ring motor is mostly superseded by induction motors with variable-frequency drives.

Ambalapady Mahakali Temple

Ambalapady Mahakali Temple.
Ambalpady is another holy place in the surroundings of Udupi, the land of Lord Sri Krishna. With the ancient Sri Janardana temple having Mahakali mandir by the side, Janardana pushkarani in the front, an Anjaneya temple with an idol incorporating incarnations of Mukhyaprana, and a Brandavan of Raghavendra Swamji in the surroundings, it has been growing as a religious and cultural centre in the coastal belt of Karnataka.
With the Sri Krishna temple to the east and the holy beach where Sri Madhwacharya got the idol of Lord Krishna to the west, Ambalpady is situated about 2 miles away from Udupi bus-stand. If Lord Krishna is facing west, Lord Janardana at Ambalpady is facing east. If a straight line is drawn to the west from Udupi Krishna temple, it reaches the Ambalpady Janardana temple. Janardana is the presiding deity of Ambalpady
To his southeast is goddess Mahakali who is worshipped with greater ardour. This is common as children go more often to their mother than to their father and confess their mother knowing for help. With the same belief, devotees come to goddess Mahakali to be relieved of their sins and get solution to their problems. There is one more reason for her dominance here. She had come earlier to this place to protect the land, and the place got its name because of her. Ambalpady is ‘Ammana Padi’, or the ‘Woods of Amma’. Later it became Ambalpady. It is believed that initially goddess Mahakali was worshipped in a stone. The same stone is being worshipped even now along with the wooden idol of Mahakali. Thus, Mahakali was worshipped earlier in this region and Janardana Swamy came here in search of the goddess and decided to stay here and protect devotees. Some knowledge of the history of Ambalpady is very essential to know about the goddess and Lord Janardana.

Gonioceras

Gonioceras is an actinocerid with a broad, low shell; flattened ventrally, convexly rounded dorsally; top and bottom meeting at an acute angle along the sides. In most the shell is rather thin, especially along the lateral portion. The aperture is contracted. Sutures from broad ventral and dorsal lobes, more narrowly rounded ventro-lateral and dorso-lateral saddles, and sharp pointed lateral lobes; more complex than in later "Lambeoceras". The siphuncle is typically subcentral but may be closer to the venter; armenocerid in form with short segments and very short brims and containing a straight endosiphuncular canal system.
Gonioceras is derived from "Armenoceras" and is the sole representative of the Gonioceratidae. It is found in the Chazy and Blackriveran of the Middle Ordovician in the Champlain region of eastern North America and at the Paquette Rapids of the Ottawa River in Ontario. The genotype, "Gonioceras anceps" was named by Hall in 1847
Gonioceras was surely a bottom dweller that spent most of its time settled on the sea floor where it may have filled some of the niche filled by modern sting rays. However with its stiff outer shell, Gonioceras would not have been as mobile.

Temnos

Temnos (Latinized, Temnus) was a small Greek city-state of Aeolia, later incorporated in the Roman province of Asia, on the western coast of Anatolia. Its bishopric was a suffragan of Ephesus, the capital and metropolitan see of the province, and is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.
The little town was near the Hermus River, which is shown on its coins. Situated at elevation it commanded the territories of Cyme, Phocaea, and Smyrna. Under Augustus it was already on the decline; under Tiberius it was destroyed by an earthquake; and in the time of Pliny it was no longer inhabited. It was however rebuilt later.
One of the city's more noteworthy figures was the rhetorician Hermagoras.
Bishops.
Le Quien ("Oriens Christianus", I, 707), mentions three bishops: 
This see is not mentioned in the "Notitiae Episcopatuum". Ramsay ("Asia Minor", 108) thought the diocese of Temnus identical with that of Archangelus, which from the tenth to the thirteenth century the "Notitiae Episcopatuum" assigns to Smyrna. In 1413 the Turks seized the fortress of Archangelus, which they called Kaiadjik, i.e., small rock; this fortress was situated on the plains of Maenomenus, now known as Menemen. Doubtless, Temnus and Menemen are the same. However, Texier (Asie Mineure, 227) identifies Temnus with the village of Guzel Hissar, to the north of Menemen.

Movewithus

Move with Us is a British-based property company that provides estate agency, asset management and corporate property services to estate agents, home builders, financial institutions and consumers. Their headquarters are located in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. The company has twice been named on the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 list and in 2008 was named in the Profit Track 100 list.
Move with Us operates a network of estate agents across the UK, currently numbering over 1,200. They offer a wide range of property related products including estate agency referral, conveyancing and home-utility switching.
Move with Us also offers property sale services to many UK-based home builders and financial institutions. The properties acquired in such transactions are known as 'corporate properties' and are sold by Move with Us via their network of estate agents and directly to consumers through the brand name white hot property.
History.
Formed as Partners in Property in 1997 by four estate agents operating in and around the Cambridgeshire region, the company sought to provide revenue-generating services for independent estate agents to enable them to compete with larger corporate agencies. In 2000, the group expanded and began providing managed part-exchange services for UK home builders, using the agents in their network to value and sell the properties on the home builder's behalf. In 2001 they expanded further, incorporating the valuation and sale of properties acquired by building societies, mortgage lenders and other financial institutions in repossession and probate transactions.
In summer 2008, Move with Us launched their brand 'whitehot property'. The brand was designed to differentiate properties on the market which come from corporate sellers, as opposed to private sellers. Only properties that have been through a controlled, independent valuation process and have no 'sales chains' are branded as 'white hot properties'.

He has played bass guitar with Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers and The Searchers (since 1964 when he replaced original bass guitarist Tony Jackson), who he is still with today. Allen joined Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers as rhythm guitarist in 1961, and changed over to bass guitar in early 1962, following the departure of Ben Jordan.
When Tony Jackson left the Searchers in August 1964 after a string of hits (including "Sweets for My Sweet", "Sugar and Spice" and "Needles and Pins"), Allen was asked to join the group. They then recorded "When You Walk in the Room", with Mike Pender and Frank Allen singing a dual lead line.
Allen has turned to writing as a parallel occupation with a humorous book of touring recollections called "Travelling Man" in 1999 (Aureus Publishing), as well as articles for newspapers and periodicals. His definitive and detailed biography of the Searchers entitled "The Searchers And Me - A History of the Legendary Sixties Hitmakers", was published by Aureus in April 2009..

Haller Nutt

Haller Nutt (1816-1864) was an American Southern planter. He was a successful cotton planter and plantation owner in Mississippi. He developed a strain of cotton that became important commercially for the Deep South.
Biography.
Early life.
Haller Nutt was born on February 17, 1816 on Laurel Hill Plantation in Jefferson County, Mississippi, United States. His father was Dr. Rushton Nutt, son of Richard Nutt of Northumberland County, Virginia. It likely was Rushton Nutt who developed the Petit Gulf cotton. Haller was a child when the fungus-resistant cotton was developed, so should not be credited with its development. Rushton Nutt, in 1820, had 30 slaves. In 1830, he had 321 slaves, a good indication that he had profited economically. He was educated at the University of Virginia from 1832 to 1835. 
Career.
He returned to Mississippi and assisted his father in the management of Laurel Hill Plantation. 
He owned several plantations throughout his life, including Araby, Evergreen and Winter Quarters in Louisiana and Cloverdale and Laurel Hill in Mississippi. He mainly grew cash crops, including cotton and sugar cane. These plantations brought him considerable wealth. He made a net profit of more than $228,000 from agricultural enterprises in 1860. He owned of land and 800 slaves. His fortune prior to the Civil War was estimated at more than three million dollars.
He suffered large financial losses during the American Civil War due to the destruction of his cotton fields and real estate. The expropriation of stores and supplies by the Union and Confederate armies led to the foreclosure on Nutt's plantations in Louisiana. After the war, he filed documents with the federal government that would compensate for the loss of assets due to the Union army.
Personal life.
He married Julia Augusta Williams in 1840. She was only eighteen at the time. They had eleven children:
They decided to begin construction on Longwood (Natchez, Mississippi) in the spring of 1860. They hired Philadelphia architect Samuel Sloan to design the multistory octagonal in the Oriental Revival style. Construction of the exterior was completed by the beginning of the Civil War. With the threat of the Civil War looming, Sloan's artisans soon halted their construction, fearing for their safety, and fled back to the North. The basement story was completed by slave labor and was ready for occupancy by 1862. Longwood is the largest octagonal house in the United States.
He died on June 15, 1864, of pneumonia. His family continued living at Longwood plantation after his death.

Standard Brands (album)

Standard Brands is an album by Chet Atkins and Canadian guitarist Lenny Breau, released in 1981. 
History.
Due to Breau's drug problems, the album took nearly two years to complete.
Atkins was instrumental in getting Lenny his first recording contract after hearing one of his (Lenny's) studio tapes. Atkins stated in an interview for "Frets" magazine: "Paul Yandell first brought Lenny to my attention around 1966. I immediately knew that here was one of the great players of this world. He had taken some of my fragmentary ideas, and gone on and on into musical areas I had never dreamed of."
Atkins also produced and recorded two other releases by Breau. Chet said of his longtime friend: "He was a great fingerstylist with fathomless knowledge. His legend will continue to inspire future generations."
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, music critic Robert Taylor wrote of "Standard Brands": "The pairing of these two guitar legends for a series of guitar duets was long overdue, but thankfully was well preserved and finally reissued... The interplay between the duo is a fascinating lesson in the old teaching the new and vice versa... A wonderful piece of guitar history."

Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway

The Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway was an early British railway company, which opened in 1850.
The original aim was to link to the proposed Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway at Ambergate to link Manchester with Boston and the East Coast. It would proceed eastwards north of Ripley and Eastwood to a proposed Midland Railway line from Bulwell to Nottingham. There it would join the latter's Lincoln line as far as Colwick where there would be a junction. Proceeding to Grantham and Spalding, there would be two branches, one to Sleaford, the other to Boston
Not only were subscriptions minimal, some investors reneged on their pledges - a common state of affairs in early railway history. In the event it only opened from Nottingham to Grantham. The line is still in use.
The Ambergate, Nottingham and Boston and Eastern Junction Railway Act received Parliamentary approval on 16 July 1846., and the engineer was John Underwood, an associate of John Urpeth Rastrick 
For all that it crossed a number of river valleys, the terrain was favourable. The major engineering work was the viaduct at Radcliffe over the River Trent. The Trent Navigation Company insisted on a clear span of at least 100 ft and so a 110 ft cast iron arch was constructed on the northwest side, with three masonry arches on the approach.
Opening.
Rather than build its own expensive station in Nottingham, the ANB&EJR sought running powers into the Midland Railway's Carrington Street station, from a junction at Colwick. With the support of the city fathers it obtained these, but the Midland insisted that ANB&EJR bought out the Nottingham and Grantham Canals two months after opening the line from Ambergate to Grantham. This final blow to the company's overstretched finances were to have unfortunate, and unintended, repercussions for the Midland.
The line opened for passengers on 15, July,1850 from its own terminus at Ambergate Yard at the Old Wharf in Grantham to Colwick Junction.
Initially it was worked by E. B. Wilson and Company under contract to the proprietors, with David Joy as the locomotive foreman. The opening seems to have been somewhat chaotic. We have an informative account in David Joy's diary in which he tells us that, when he arrived two days before the opening, nothing was ready for him, and no engines to be found. He prevailed upon the Midland to lend him two Bury Singles.
He writes ""E. B. Wilson fetched me on a Friday evening in a cab, took me to Arthington Hall to go next evening to open Nottingham and Grantham Railway on the Monday. He had taken it to work by contract at 2s. per mile run. No engines, nothing ready. To Nottingham early Saturday. Midland Railway supplied us with two old Bury's singles to be at Grantham Sunday night. Saturday afternoon over the line with Underwood (engineer), Gough (secretary), and on the contractor's (G. Wythes) engine (ballast), went off the road, not very fast, but a jolly tumble about.""
However the first train departed at 9 a.m. with half a dozen second and third class carriages and a number of wagons.
As with most railways of the time, operation was somewhat haphazard and it wasn't long before the first accident in October, 1850.
Joy again: ""We had got another engine from Railway Foundry, known as No. 266, and she did "goods"; and Nottingham Goose Fair coming, and a special ordered for Nottingham, I snapped at the chance of driving one of the engines. I don't know how it all came about, but at night I found myself on the leading engine, the other old Bury behind with old Pilkington as driver down at the junction of the Mansfield line at the front of a long line of carriages, on the down main line, which, for the day, was being used to stand lines of trains—the down trains for Mansfield being shunted at the junction on to the up line to the next station. It was pitch dark; and we waited for a signal to go on to Nottinghem with our train, and waited long. At last a rustle, and I thought we were going to be liberated by the passing out of the mail to Derby. So watched for her disappearing sideways to the right, but no, I could see her sweeping round and approaching us. And instantly I calculated that she could not have stopped and passed on to the up line at the junction, so must be on our line rushing upon us. It was not many seconds before we found all this true, as we jumped from our engines and rushed forward on the "in" side of the curve, and only just in time, for I saw the flare of the ashpan of the coming engine ripple over the sleepers as she came on, and heard the broken buffers of my own engine wizz over my head. It was only just in time, the next instant our two poor little light Bury engines were one wreck of material in front of the big six-coupled, with a train of twenty crammed carriages behind her. The footplate of my engine disappeared entirely, the firebox of the engine falling in between the legs of the tank—buffers and buffer beams gone altogether. It was an awful experience, and none of us forgot it in a hurry.""
The Midland lent some more engines and Joy writes ""one was a little Sharp. This little engine was nearly the death of a nephew of one of my directors. He wanted to ride with me on the footplate one night with a special I said, No! We ran down Bingham Bank into a fog — stuck — no weather board. Suddenly we went through the road crossing gates, the bits flew all round us, we knew how to duck.""
Takeover battle.
Both the Midland and the LNWR were interested in making a takeover, since it would impede the Great Northern's progress. Meanwhile, the Great Northern was keen to penetrate Nottinghamshire and its coalfields, something that Midland in particular was resisting, making a takeover offer in 1851. However a member of the GNR board had acquired a holding of ANB&EJR shares and was able to resist the offer.
In 1852 the Great Northern arrived at Grantham and a connection was built into its station. Running rights were agreed such that the GN was able advertise through coaches from Nottingham to London in competition with the Midland.
The latter obtained an Order in Chancery preventing the GN from running into Nottingham, but in 1852 an ANB&EJR train arrived in Nottingham with a GNR locomotive at its head. When it uncoupled and went to "run around" the train it found its way blocked by a Midland loco, while another blocked its retreat. The engine was shepherded to a nearby shed and, for good measure, the tracks were lifted. This episode became known as the "Battle of Nottingham" and, though the action moved to the courtroom, it was seven months before the loco was released.
From 2 April 1855 the Great Northern agreed to work the line for a period of ten years. The directors of the ANBEJR, not having completed the line throughout, held that they were not bound to buy the two canals. The canal proprietors took the matter to court, the sale was effected and, in 1860, the name was changed to the Nottingham and Grantham Railway and Canal Company. In 1861 it was leased to the GNR completely.
Though the Midland grudgingly accepted passengers into its station, it refused to handle goods which had to be carted from the terminus at Colwick. The GNR therefore built its own terminus at London Road in 1857. In 1900 a new station, Nottingham Victoria, was built jointly with the Great Central Railway.
The GNR built its GNR Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension in 1878 then acquired the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1881 thus gaining a through route from Grantham to Wales.
Present day.
The line is still open to passengers (see Nottingham-Grantham Line) and the table above shows the present day stations. It departs from the Nottingham line at Colwick Junction as a double line, reducing to single immediately on the approach to Grantham station.

Reminiscing (Chet Atkins and Hank Snow album)

Reminiscing is the title of the first collaborative long-play recording by American country music artists Chet Atkins and Hank Snow, released in 1964. 
History.
The liner notes, titled "Guitar Duets by a Pair of Favorites", are by Chris Lane, a program director from KAYO radio in Seattle, Washington, who takes credit for recommending the collaboration to RCA.
Snow and Atkins had been doing guitar duets on various radio stations, gathering listeners and fans. Their first single was "Reminiscing", produced roughly seven years before the release of this LP. Atkins and Snow had a hit single in 1955, a guitar duet called "Silver Bell." A regular at the Grand Ole Opry, Snow was a Hall of Fame country music singer and songwriter. He had a career covering six decades during which he sold more than 80 million albums. Atkins had not only made his mark as a sideman and recording artist on his own, but was also busy producing many major country artists and developing Nashville as a major center for country music recording.
Atkins and Snow joined forces again in 1969 to record "C.B. Atkins & C.E. Snow by Special Request". Both albums are out of print and have not been re-issued on CD.

Tay Whale

The Tay Whale was a humpback whale that swam into the Firth of Tay of eastern Scotland in 1883. It was harpooned, escaped, but was found dead a week later. It was towed into Dundee by a showman, John Woods, and exhibited on tour across Britain.
The Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, John Struthers dissected the whale, much of the time in public with a military band playing in the background, organized by Woods. The decomposing whale made Woods a great deal of money, and Struthers famous.
History.
In December 1883, a humpback whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off the eastern Scottish town of Dundee, at that time a whaling port, and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the whaling boats were in harbour for the winter, some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters.
After several failed attempts, they harpooned the humpback on 31 December 1883. It was a strong male, and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as Montrose and then to the Firth of Forth. After a struggle that lasted all night, the harpoon lines broke and the whale escaped.
A week later the whale was found dead, floating out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with flukes 11 feet 4 inches wide. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and had it transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.
The local newspaper, the "Dundee Courier", published at least 21 pieces on the Tay Whale between 12 November 1883 and 11 January 1884. The headlines included:
Finally on 25 January 1884, when the whale was too badly decomposed for further public exhibition, Struthers was allowed to come and dissect the famous specimen. He was well used to working on stinking carcasses: his dissecting room was reputed to stink "like the deck of a Greenland whaler". He had two assistants; but the dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public to watch the dissection in progress, for a fee, with a military band playing in the background.
There were snow showers, but Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh embalmed; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London. Finally on 7 August 1884 Struthers was able to remove the skull and the rest of the skeleton. Struthers eventually wrote seven anatomy articles over the next decade on the whale, and ultimately published a complete monograph on it in 1889.
In 2011, the whale's skeleton was displayed in the McManus Galleries in Dundee.
Fame for anatomist.
Struthers became popularly famous for his dissection of the Tay Whale, his largest specimen. It was one of a wide range of specimens of many species that he energetically collected to form a museum of zoology, to illustrate Darwin's theories.
Fame in doggerel.
The whale became so famous that the doggerel poet William Topaz McGonagall wrote a notably bad poem, "The Famous Tay Whale", about it. Two of the verses run:
This was not the only piece of doggerel verse about the whale, as a poet signing himself "Spectator" published "The Whale Interviewed by his Mother on his Exploits in the River Tay" in the "Dundee Courier", with verses such as:

Neuville, Quebec

Neuville is a village on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, just west of Quebec City, part of the Portneuf Regional County Municipality, Quebec, Canada. It was founded in 1684, and has remained quite picturesque throughout these years.
The 19th-century artist, Antoine Plamondon, (ca. 1804-1895) moved here by 1850, with his mother, a brother and sister. He lived the rest of his life here, more than 40 years.
Neuville has an excellent marina for pleasure sailboats and yachts.
History.
In 1653, the area was granted as a seignory by Jean de Lauson to Jean Bourdon de Saint-Jean (ca. 1601-1668) for his son Jean-François Bourdon de Dombourg (1647–1690), who was an engineer, surveyor, cartographer, and Attorney General to the sovereign. In 1680, the Dombourg Seignory was acquired by Nicolas Dupont de Neuville (1632–1716), whereafter the seignory was known as Neuville.
In 1679, the Saint-François-de-Sales Parish was formed; it became a civil parish in 1684. The place was also called Pointe-aux-Trembles (or Pointe-au-Tremble), in reference to the point on which the church was built, which once was covered with aspen and birch.
In 1850, the post office opened, identified as Pointe-aux-Trembles. In 1855, the place was incorporated as a Parish Municipality of Saint-François-de-Sales, but renamed to Pointe-aux-Trembles some time after. In 1919, part of its territory separated to form the Village Municipality of Neuville.
On December 18, 1996, the Village Municipality of Neuville and the Parish Municipality of Pointe-aux-Trembles merged again to form the new City of Neuville.
Demographics.
Population trend:
Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 1596 (total dwellings: 1670)

Remington Model 17

In 1915 John Browning patented a pump-action shotgun with the following features: hammerless, under-loading, tubular-magazine, bottom-ejecting, and take-down. This design would eventually become the Remington Model 17. Manufacturing rights were sold to Remington Arms shortly after, but due to the production efforts of World War I, Remington was unable to begin manufacturing until 1921. Before production began John Pedersen made alterations to the design, with more changes made later by G.H. Garrison. The Model 17 was a trim, 20-gauge shotgun that served as the design basis for three highly successful shotguns: the Remington Model 31, the Ithaca 37 and the Browning BPS. Additionally, features of the Model 17 were also incorporated in the later Mossberg 500 and Remington 870.

Life.
He was a son of the rector of Landulph, Cornwall. He studied at Westminster School and in 1665 was elected to a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1668 he went to Spain as secretary of the ambassador, Sir William Godolphin, and while residing there embraced the Catholic faith. 
He returned to England after three years and engaged in a religious controversy with Edward Stillingfleet (8 August 1671). In this discussion, an account of which he published in 1684, he was aided by Edmund Coleman, who was executed seven years later for alleged complicity in the Popish Plot. 
In 1682 Meredith wrote a reply to one Samuel Johnson, who had libelled the Duke of York in a work entitled "Julian the Apostle". On 7 September 1684, he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Watten, Flanders, under the name of Langford (or Langsford). 
He evidently returned in a few years to England, where he published several controversial pamphlets. On the fall of James II, he withdrew to Saint-Germain. He was resident in Rome during the years 1700 and 1701: the year of his death is uncertain, but his will, dated 1715, is said to be preserved in the archives of the English College, Rome.

L'architecture Vivante

L'Architecture Vivante was a French magazine for avant-garde architecture published from 1923 - 1932.
"L’Architecture Vivante".
Jean Badovici edited this magazine devoted to avant-garde architecture and published quarterly between 1923 and 1932. He was an influential critic and mentor in France of international modern architecture, and he convinced the publisher, Albert Morancé, of the need for such a magazine. "L’Architecture Vivante" immediately became an influential advocate of the International style (Bauhaus, Constructivism, De Stijl). Badovici's friend Le Corbusier, for instance, became one of the architects whose ideals were frequently discussed in the magazine. Badovici cultivated relations with other European avant-garde magazines such as "Wendingen" (Netherlands) and "Cahiers d'Art" (France), founded in 1926 by his friend Christian Zervos.
Each issue of "L’Architecture Vivante" routinely presented a number of architects and their works, but a few issues were devoted to a single designer (Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret and, in 1929, Eileen Gray and her home E-1027).

Newhouse, Utah

Newhouse is a ghost town located on the eastern edge of the Wah Wah Valley in Beaver County, Utah, United States. A silver mining town based on the Cactus Mine on the western slopes of the San Francisco Mountains, Newhouse was smaller and quieter than Frisco, to the southeast.
History.
The Cactus Mine was first identified as a silver mine in 1870, one of the earliest in the San Francisco Mining District. A succession of companies over the next thirty years failed to profit from the mine. A small smelter was built here in 1892, but was never successful. Everything changed in 1900, when Samuel Newhouse bought the property. A wealthy Salt Lake City entrepreneur, Newhouse had successfully financed the development of copper mining at the Bingham Canyon Mine two years before. Finally, enough capital was available to make the Cactus Mine workable. The mining camp that formed on his land was initially known as "Tent Town", for the temporary nature of its dwellings.
Under Newhouse's management, the silver mining business began to boom. By 1905, the town, now named "Newhouse", had many permanent structures, including a restaurant, library, livery stable, hospital, stores, hotel, opera house, and dance hall. Samuel Newhouse was an experienced developer and promoter, and he kept tight control over his company town. He built over seventy stucco company houses for miners to rent. The company piped water from the Wah Wah Springs and installed an electrical generation system. A town park was irrigated with excess water left over from mining and culinary use. As owner, Newhouse named the town's businesses, such as the Cactus Trading Company, the Cactus Club, the Cactus Dancehall, and the Cactus Cafe, after the mine. Public drunkenness was strictly forbidden, and the only saloon permitted was built a mile from town, off of Newhouse's property. Newhouse offered a $50 prize to the first parents to have a baby in Newhouse, and he gave all the town's children Christmas presents.
Newhouse's success was short-lived. By 1910, the Cactus Mine was worked out, and other area mines never amounted to much. Most of the miners took their families elsewhere. Many buildings, including the well-built dance hall, were moved away to Milford. The cafe kept operating, serving those few miners who stayed on, until it burned down in 1921.
In 1922, filmmakers came to Newhouse to make the silent film "The Covered Wagon".
Dozens of ruined buildings, foundations, and rubble remain at the town site.

A .ZAP file can be as simple or as complicated as the System Administrator wishes to make it. There are only two required fields in a .ZAP file, an Application Name (called a Friendly Name) and a Setup Command line. Other information is optional.
The .ZAP File begins with a title line consisting of the word Application inside single Square Brackets ([ ]). Underneath this come the entry fields, the two Required fields being FriendlyName = ""Name"" and SetupCommand = ""\\Server\share\setupfile"". You can also add Optional entries, such as DisplayVersion = and Publisher =. Note that DisplayVersion and Publisher do not require Quotation Marks around the variables.
Below is a very simple example of a .ZAP file.
Restrictions to a .ZAP File.
The .ZAP file is more restricted than a .MSI file in that it cannot be rolled back if the application fails to install correctly, cannot use elevated privileges to install itself (i.e. the User needs to have the rights to install the software - usually given by Group Policy) and cannot install on first use, or install a separate feature on first use.
Many .ZAP Files require user intervention. This can be overcome if the Systems Administrator creates a Batch file and runs a quiet or silent install from a Batch File command. However, running an Executable file (such as setup.exe) often bypasses quiet, passive or silent installation switches, even if specified in the SetupCommand.
In addition, .ZAP files are not run automatically prior to, or during a User Logon. Instead, the User must access Add/Remove Programs from within the Windows Control Panel, Select Add New Programs and select the Installation from here. The User must have access to the location where the .ZAP file is located and have access to the location of the Setup files (if these locations are different), otherwise they will not be able to install the Application.
.ZAP Files cannot be Assigned to Computers and must be published to Users. Therefore when a User moves to another computer (even only temporarily) they can install this application on that machine whether the program should be there or not.
Finally, .ZAP Files do not automatically uninstall when a User no longer requires the software. Instead, the software remains installed on the machine permanently, unlike a .MSI installation which can be set to uninstall when the Computer is removed from the relevant OU.
Publishing a .ZAP File.
After creating a .ZAP file and placing it in an accessible share - usually creating an Active Directory Group with access to this location - the Systems Administrator needs to create a Group Policy Object, open the editing screen, select User Configuration, Software Settings and Software Installation and create a New Package to the location of the .ZAP file. Since GPOs default to .MSI, the System Admin needs to ensure that they search for .ZAP files, instead of .MSI files.
Accepting the new package and assigning the GPO to the relevant Organizational Unit (OU) will publish the application. The user(s) will then need to reload the group policy from the server which manages GPO. This can be done either through logging off and then on again, or by running "gpupdate" through a command line.

The game is set in ancient China during and after the fall of the Han dynasty with some major differences, most notably; Most of the male characters in the novel have become female and The Three Kingdoms that were formed after the Han Dynasty, had already been established. Despite each kingdom being ruled by an independent monarchy, the three kingdoms are still loyal to the Han empire. However, the empire is on the verge of collapse as civil unrest, banditry and infighting bring turmoil to the nation.
As the empire finally collapse and warlords wage war with each other, amidst the turmoil several major factions are formed, ready to rule and unite the fractured nation. These major factions (5 in Koihime Musō, 7 in the sequel) are the Shoku faction (Chinese: 蜀, Shǔ) led by Kazuto Hongō in Koihime Musō and in the sequel, Queen Ryūbi (Liu Bei) of the Kingdom of Shu, the Gi faction (Chinese: 魏, Wèi) led by Queen Sōsō (Cao Cao) of the Kingdom of Wei, the Go faction (Chinese: 吳, Wú) led by Princess Sonken (Sun Quan) of the Kingdom of Wu and in the sequel, her older sister Queen Sonsaku (Sun Ce), the Tōtaku faction (Chinese: 董卓, Dong Zhuo) led by Governess Tōtaku, Governor of Dong province, the En/Yuan faction led by Lady Enshō, Lord of Yuan province, and in the sequel the Kōkintō/Yellow Turban Rebels led by the Zhang sisters, Chōkaku, Chōhō and Chōryō and the Nanban/Southern Barbarians led by Mōkaku.

Frank Stoddard

Frank Stoddard is a NASCAR crew chief and owner from Haverhill, New Hampshire. He is the owner of Go FAS Racing, a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team. He began his career with Dana Patten in the Busch Series. Later, he worked with Jeff Burton and Roush Racing, and won seventeen races together. Late in the 2002 season, he switched to Bill Davis Racing and served as crew chief for Ward Burton. In 2005, he joined MB/Sutton Motorsports as the crew chief for a lifelong friend Boris Said in the No. 36 Chevrolet, making nine starts with one top-five finish.
In 2006, Said and Stoddard teamed with Mark Simo to field the No. 60 No Fear Ford. The team has three top-tens and one pole position.
Roush-Racing Era.
In 1994, Stoddard was hired by Jack Roush as a crew chief for rookie Jeff Burton driving in the #99 Ford. Stoddard would guide Burton to 14 wins including the Coca-Cola 600 in 2001. In 2002 Stoddard left Roush Racing to go to Bill Davis racing with Ward Burton as the driver and then rookie Scott Wimmer.
2005-present: Reunited with Boris Said.
In 2005, Frank Stoddard reunited with a lifelong friend of his; one of the world's greatest road course racers; Boris Said who was driving for NASCAR on part-time schedules mostly on road course races. They formed a race team with PepsiCo's Sobe Energy Drink called No Fear Racing in which Pepsi, Stoddard, and Boris Said would buy cars from Roush Fenway Racing and have a campaign called ""Sell more cases so we can run more races."" In 2006, they finished in 9th place at Sonoma after qualifying in fourth spot for their first race. The next week in one of Daytona's biggest upsets, Boris Said and Stoddard won the team the pole spot for the 2006 Pepsi 400. In the race, Boris drove through the top ten nearly all day and during a caution, took the lead by not pitting for tires. They led nine laps about to win one of NASCAR's biggest events ever. As the final restart occurred with 3 laps left, the fans roared believing that Boris would win the event. With 2 laps left, Tony Stewart stunned Boris and everybody when he got by Boris Said for the lead after briefly losing some ground, and seconds later Kyle and Kurt Busch drove by Boris Said who held on for 4th place; the team's best finish that point at Daytona. Boris Said and Stoddard emotionally said in post-race ceremonies that although they did not win, Said's performance and finish felt like a win to him.
In 2007 in the Daytona 500, Boris Said and Stoddard posted a good finish for them when taking advantage of a final lap big one to finish in 15th place. Had the crash not occurred Said would have finished in 26th place. Boris Said and Frank Stoddard nearly won the pole spot for the 2007 Pepsi 400 again for a second consecutive time but they ended up being knocked out of the race by a rainshower when they were about to conclude qualifying and take the pole. This is one of Boris Said and Frank Stoddard's most heartbreaking parts of their career. After Boris Said ended up failing to qualify for a race at Watkins Glen because of rain, he gave up on their slogan and decided to continue his part-time career.
After 2007's season Boris Said and Frank Stoddard found themselves being separated due to issues on the teams. Stoddard would rarely work for Said until 2010 when they were reunited again this time driving for a part-time different team.
2010.
In 2010, Stoddard was reunited with Boris Said at new upstart team Latitude 43 Motorsports. They raced together for the first four races, posting a top-25 run in the Daytona 500. At Sonoma, Frank Stoddard was furious with Tony Stewart for contact on the final lap. Boris Said took control of Stoddard and apologized for Stoddard's behavior. Stoddard was released from his team after 2010, and Boris Said also left the team refusing to let Stoddard go by himself as close friends.
2011.
On February 3, 2011 Boris Said and Frank Stoddard announced the formation of FAS Lane Racing The team will field the No. 32 with Ford as the manufacturer, with cars from Roush-Fenway Racing and Richard Petty Motorsports and a Doug Yates engine. U.S. Chrome sponsored the team at Daytona with Terry Labonte driving, a move that guaranteed the 32 an entry into the Daytona 500, since Labonte was the most recent former champion in a team not in the Top 35 owner's points. The team ran the full season with a variety of drivers including Ken Schraeder, Boris Said and Mike Skinner. The team finished 34th in owner's points, despite not qualifying at Bristol Motor Speedway.
2012.
The team competed in 2012 with a variety of drivers, including Labonte, Schrader, Timmy Hill, Mike Bliss, Reed Sorenson, and two-time K&N East champion Mike Olsen. Boris Said one of the team's co-owners, also raced part-time driving at Sonoma and Watkins Glen.
2013.
FAS Lane Racing ran 2013 with three drivers: Labonte, Schrader, and ROTY candidate Hill. Boris Said would race at Sonoma and Watkins Glen again.
2014.
FAS Lane Racing merged with Go Green Racing for the 2014 season, forming Go FAS Racing.

Tzidkatcha

Tzidkatcha (צדקתך, "Your righeousness") is a prayer consisting of group of three verses that is recited during the afternoon prayer on "Shabbat". It is said in memory of three righteous individuals who died on "Shabbat": Joseph, Moses and King David. It is recited at this prayer in particular because these individuals died in the afternoon.
Prayer content and meaning.
The three verses are: Psalms 119:142, 71:19 and 36:7. They are recited in this order by Ashkenazi tradition, while Sephardi tradition calls for reciting them in the order as they appear in Psalms.
The "Bach" asserts that Moses did not die in the afternoon of "Shabbat" but of Friday; however, he wasn't buried until "Shabbat" afternoon. Some say that the recital of this is to recall just judgement because it is immediately after "Shabbat" that sinners return to Gehinom.
The recitation of these verses represents our acceptance of God's judgment, referred to as "Tziduk HaDin" (צידוק הדין, "the righteousness of God's judgement"). It expresses the conviction that God is just in his actions, even when they are seemingly negative in human eyes. Because the time for afternoon prayers on "Shabbat" is near the closing of the day, the saddened atmosphere makes it appropriate for this prayer to be said. On days on which Tachanun would be omitted had it been a weekday, "Tzidkatcha" is omitted on "Shabbat", as the added happiness of the day negates these feelings of sorrow.
Because of the somber mood that is hinted to by this prayer, there is a related custom of not wishing the standard "Shabbat" greeting after the Mincha prayer.

West Amwell Township School District

The West Amwell Township School District is a community public school district that serves students in pre-Kindergarten through sixth grade from West Amwell Township, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States.
In a special election held in September 2013, voters from Lambertville, Stockton and West Amwell Township passed referenda to dissolve the South Hunterdon Regional School District and to combine the three existing school districts from each municipality (Lambertville City School District, Stockton Borough School District and West Amwell Township School District), with majorities in each community passing both ballot items. A single combined regional district would be created, serving students in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade, in which property taxes would be levied under a formula in which 57% is based on property values and 43% on the number of students. The executive county superintendent will appoint an interim board of education for the new regional district, which will be responsible for implementing the merger.
As of the 2010-11 school year, the district and its one school had a total enrollment of 247 students and 23.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.47:1.

Striporama

Striporama is a 1953 comedy film directed by Jerald Intrator. The film starred a number of burlesque comedy, dance and striptease acts that were popular during the early 1950s. Today, it is best known as one of the few feature films starring pin-up model Bettie Page.
Plot.
A meeting of the “Council of Culture” is taking place in New York City. The council is collecting various art forms for inclusion in a time capsule, However, the council members refuse to consider having mention of burlesque entertainment in their time capsule. News of the decisions reaches a trio of burlesque comics (Jack Diamond, Mandy Kay and Charles Harris), who disrupt the council’s meeting by imitating gangsters. The three funnymen take out a movie projector to offer evidence of the artistic value of burlesque entertainment. The remainder of the film is a plotless revue that features such acts as stripper Rosita Royce dancing with a number of trained birds, the Apache-style dance duo of Marinette and Andre, a male bodybuilder dubbed “Mr. America” who flexes his muscles and plays the harmonica while balancing a blonde woman on his shoulders, a number of routines featuring solo women (including Lili St. Cyr) in various acts of undressing, and several comedy sketches including Diamond, Kay and Harris
Production and rediscovery.
"Striporama" was filmed in color, which was unusual for low-budget burlesque revue films. The production also offered the only color footage of Bettie Page in a speaking role. In the film, Page appears twice: in a comic sequence where she is the shared dream of roommates Diamond and Kay, and later as a harem girl who enjoyed an extended bubble bath. "Striporama" also saw an early appearance by actress Jeanne Carmen, who had a dialogue-free bit part as a streetwalker that circled the Marinette and Andre dance number.
"Striporama" was originally released in adults-only theaters that specialized in exploitation films. Over the years, the last five minutes of original footage became lost. As a public domain film, it had been available from several home video labels.
In May 2001, the film had a theatrical re-release in New York City. Critics who reviewed "Striporama" nearly a half-century after it was created compared its rediscovery to its time capsule plot device. David Sterritt, writing in the "Christian Science Monitor", noted the film was “quite tame despite its lurid title, containing little that would push the boundaries of today's PG-13 rating.” Michael Atkinson, writing in the "Village Voice", found the film “occupying a nudity-free yet salacious middle ground between, say, "Singin' in the Rain" (the “Beautiful Girl” fashion show is echoed here) and progressive seaminess like Ed Wood and Stephen Apostolof's "Orgy of the Dead".” Armond White, reviewing the film for the "New York Press", considered the film “a shabby camp experience, but as a relic of what show business and movies used to be, it instructs one on changing tastes in sex and humor.”

MT Sidsel Knutsen

MT "Sidsel Knutsen" is a Norwegian oil tanker built in 1993.
Design.
The "Sidsel Knutsen" is long and is owned and operated by Knutsen O.A.S. Shipping. The "Sidsel Knutsen" is designed for the shipping of oil products, including gasoline, plain crude oil, and biodiesel. The "Sidsel Knutsen" also has a sistership, the "Turid Knutsen", which is also a tanker, and was built in 1993. The home port of both ships is Haugesund, Norway. Both ships are capable of hauling 5,000 tons of cargo and are commonly loaded with over 1,000,000 gallons of various liquids. The "Sidsel Knutsen" makes frequent trips from Norway to the United States to pick up loads of biodiesel and deliver them to European ports. The company that the "Sidsel Knutsen" gets her biodiesel from is Lake Erie Biofuels, Erie, Pennsylvania. It is a major producer of biofuel in the United States.
Accidents.
2001.
The "Sidsel Knutsen" is perhaps best known for an incident that occurred in the Detroit River in October, 2001. A mail boat, "J. W. Westcott II", capsized shortly after 0700 on an October morning as she was delivering a pilot to "Sidsel Knutsen". "Westcott"’s captain, Catherine Nasiatka, 48, and deckhand David Lewis, 50, were killed in the accident. Two Canadian pilots who were aboard "Westcott" swam to safety in the fast-moving river that separates Detroit from Windsor, Ontario. The "Sidsel Knutsen" was unharmed by the incident because of her large size and steel hull.
2010.
On August 3, 2010 the "Sidesel Knusten" lost engine power after sustaining an engine fire when traveling north along the St. Clair River. The ship hit a buoy and swung around and headed for the seawall, the ship dropped its anchor before making contact and was only 10 feet from the seawall. This occurred near The Voyageur restaurant during operational hours. No injuries were reported. The ship was repaired and was back in service on August 8, 2010.

"The Spider's Feast (Le festin de l'araignée"), Op. 17, is a 1912 "ballet-pantomime" with music by the French composer Albert Roussel (1869-1937) to a scenario by Gilbert de Voisins.
The ballet.
The ballet depicts insect life in a garden, evoked by the flute solo at the opening and close of the work, and where insects are trapped in the spider's web, but when the spider prepares to begin its feast, it in turn is killed by a praying mantis. The funeral procession of the mayfly concludes the work. The full ballet lasts approximately half an hour.
"Part One"
"Part Two"
Outside of theatrical performances, an orchestral suite has been performed in concert and recorded:
Performance history.
The work was premiered at the Théâtre des Arts in Paris on 3 April 1913 with Mlle Sahary-Djali in the title role. It was revived at the Opéra-Comique on 5 December 1922 with Mado Minty as the spider and entered the repertoire of the Paris Opéra on 1 May 1939 with Suzanne Lorcia.
Typical of Roussel's earlier works, the music is impressionistic, much in the style of his countrymen Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. It is lushly orchestrated. Composed to order in only two months, the music was highly regarded for its "inventive counterpoints, bounding scherzos, gay and uneven rhythms, and personal instrumentation, both caressing and vigorous".
The symphonic fragments from the full score were first recorded in 1928 with the composer conducting (his only recording). Walter Straram and his Orchestre des Concerts Straram made a recording for Columbia in March 1930. Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra performed this orchestral suite during a broadcast concert in NBC Studio 8-H on April 7, 1946. Charles Munch and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in June 1947 recorded the work for Decca and Louis Fourestier conducting the Orchestre du Théâtre national de l'Opéra recorded it for Pathé in October 1948. In 1952, Rene Leibowitz recorded the suite with the Paris Philharmonic Orchestra and in 1953 the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Paul Paray recorded it for Mercury. Ernest Ansermet and the Suisse Romande Orchestra made the first complete recording of the ballet in 1954. Georges Prêtre recorded this same music with the Orchestre National de France for EMI in 1984. A recording by Christoph Eschenbach and the Orchestre de Paris was released on Ondine in 2008.
Instrumentation.
The scoring includes 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons; 2 horns in F (chromatiques), 2 trumpets in C; timpani, one percussion (cymbal, triangle, tambourine); celeste, harps; strings.

St. Luke's Episcopal Church (Lanesborough, Massachusetts)

St. Luke's Episcopal Church is a historic church on U.S. 7 in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. It is an early example of a stone Gothic Revival church, and only one of two surviving 19th century Gothic Revival church buildings in Berkshire County. It was built in 1836 for a parish whose history dates to 1767, and is one of the oldest Episcopal parishes in the state. At the time of its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, it retained virtually all of its interior 19th century fixtures, but had not been used as a church in some time, the congregation having relocated to a Shingle-style wood frame church built in the town center in 1898.
The church was listed on the National Register in 1972.

Candoia bibroni

Candoia bibroni is a nonvenomous boa species endemic to Melanesia and Polynesia. Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.
Etymology.
The specific name, "bibroni", is in honor of French herpetologist Gabriel Bibron.
Description.
The largest member of the genus "Candoia", adults can grow to up to 1.5m (5ft) in total length (including tail). The color pattern usually consists of a pale brown, tan, or reddish brown ground color overlaid with stripes, blotches, or spots. However, some individuals have no pattern at all.
Geographic range.
"C. bibroni" is found in Melanesia and Polynesia, including the eastern Solomon Islands (Olu Malau, Ugi, Rennell, Makira, Santa Ana, Santa Cruz, Bellona, Vanikoro and Utupua), the Banks Islands (Vanua Lava Island), Vanuatu, all three of the Loyalty Islands, the Fiji Islands (Rotuma, the Yasawa Group and the Lau Group), Western Samoa (Savii and Upolu islands), and American Samoa (Ta'u Island). 
The type locality given is ""l'île Viti"" (possibly Viti Levu, Fiji Islands). Jacquinot and Guichenot (1853) list the type locality as ""de l'archipel de Viti, Polynésie"".
Feeding.
The Pacific tree boa hunts for food both on the ground and in the trees, preying on birds, lizards, and mammals, including bats.

Thomas A. Walker

Thomas Andrew Walker (15 October 1828 – 25 November 1889) was an English civil engineering contractor. 
Walker was born at Brewood in Staffordshire. He was educated at King's College London. After his work on the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in 1852 and extensive surveys in Russia, Egypt and Sudan, in years 1863–1865, he was offered, and accepted, the management of the construction of the Metropolitan District Railway. He was then entrusted with the still more difficult work of completing the Severn Tunnel at the request of Sir John Hawkshaw. Thomas A. Walker was engaged for seven years in the construction of this tunnel. When he began work on the project he had already accumulated considerable experience in railway survey and construction throughout Canada, Russia, Egypt and England. In writing his memoirs of his work on the Severn Tunnel he states: 'Sub-aqueous tunnels have recently become quite the fashion. One such experience as the Severn Tunnel, with its ever-varying and strangely contorted strata, and the dangers from floods above and floods below, has been sufficient for me. One sub-aqueous tunnel is quite enough for a lifetime.'.' The tunnel was completed in 1887, having a length of 4 miles 628 yards ().
Other works that he undertook were the Barry Dock and Railway, and the Preston Dock, and in addition he carried out the contract for the Buenos Aires Harbour Works with John Hawkshaw and resident engineer James Murray Dobson.
His final undertaking was the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which has been described as the greatest engineering achievement of Victorian times. It is certainly an immense achievement and transformed an inland city into a major port. Thomas Andrew Walker was engaged as sole contractor in charge of the construction and he divided the thirty-six mile route into nine (soon reduced to eight) sections and appointed an engineer to take charge of each. Walker was known to be an excellent employer, looking after the needs of his workforce as best as he could and provided accommodation, meeting halls and hospital facilities.
However Walker died before the completion of this work of Bright's disease, at his home in Caer-went, Monmouthshire, on 25 November 1889 and was buried at St Stephen's Church, Caer-went. He left nearly £1 million. His nephew Charles Hay Walker, of Falkland Park, South Norwood was also a civil engineer with major works and docks constructed in Uruguay.
After his death Walker's contracts were continued by his Executors and subsequently by the formation of C. H. Walker & Co Ltd. by Thomas's nephew Charles.

Wii MotionPlus

The is an expansion device for the Wii Remote video game controller for the Wii that allows it to capture complex motion more accurately. According to Nintendo, the sensor in the device supplements the accelerometer and Sensor Bar capabilities of the Wii Remote to enable actions to be rendered identically on the screen in real time.
The Wii's successor console, the Wii U, supports the Wii MotionPlus and its peripherals in games where use of its touchscreen-built-in primary controller is not necessary.
History.
The Wii MotionPlus was announced by Nintendo in a press release on July 14, 2008, and revealed the next day at a press conference at the E3 Media & Business Summit. It was released in June 2009. On May 3, 2010, Nintendo announced that starting May 9, 2010, the company will include its Wii Sports Resort game and MotionPlus controller with new consoles with no price increase.
Development.
The Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive. The sensor used is an InvenSense IDG-600 or IDG-650 in later units, designed in accordance to Nintendo's specification; with a high dynamic range, high mechanical shock tolerance, high temperature and humidity resistance, and small physical size.
The Wii MotionPlus was conceived soon after the completion of the initial Wii Remote design, to address developer demand for more capable motion sensing, but was only announced after the sensors could be purchased in sufficient volume at a reasonable price. During a developer roundtable discussion at E3 2008, "Wii Sports Resort" producer Katsuya Eguchi discussed the potential influence of the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii's existing market, stating that Nintendo was looking at whether the MotionPlus capability will be built into the Wii Remote in the future, or kept "as an attachment we only use for certain software."
In November 2009, a black Wii MotionPlus was released to coincide with the release of the black Wii console. Bundles containing a black Wii Remote and MotionPlus attachment were also released. In North America, all black, blue, and pink Wii remotes are bundled with a MotionPlus. The Wii Remote Jacket accompanying each black Wii Remote is itself black, while the jacket in blue and pink bundles is the standard translucent color. In a 2010 Nintendo Conference, the Wii Remote Plus was announced, which places the function of the MotionPlus into a regular sized Wii remote.
Technology and features.
The device incorporates a dual-axis tuning fork gyroscope, and a single-axis gyroscope which can determine rotational motion. The information captured by the angular rate sensor can then be used to distinguish true linear motion from the accelerometer readings. This allows for the capture of more complex movements than possible with the Wii Remote alone.
The Wii MotionPlus features a pass-through External Extension Connector, allowing other expansions such as the Nunchuk or Classic Controller to be used simultaneously with the device. The attachment has a color-coded mechanical slide switch for locking the clip release. When attached to the (original, non-MotionPlus) Wii Remote, the add-on unit extends the length of the controller body by approximately . Each Wii MotionPlus includes a longer version of the Wii Remote Jacket to accommodate the added length. However, the newer Wii Remote Plus includes the MotionPlus functionality without any extra length.
The device is only used by games that have been specifically developed to use its functionality. It can remain attached to the Wii Remote when playing games that do not support it without causing any problems, but it will not enhance gameplay. The add-on version of the device must be detached when using the Wii Remote with certain accessories such as the Wii Wheel or Wii Zapper and when using most third-party peripherals, such as the Guitar Hero controllers.
Wii Remote Plus.
In September 2010, rumors were circulating of a Wii Remote with Wii MotionPlus already built in after the box art for the upcoming "FlingSmash" revealed it to be bundled with "Wii Remote Plus". Nintendo initially declined to comment, but later announced the device on September 29, 2010, confirming it to be a Wii Remote with MotionPlus built in, allowing players to use peripherals like the Wii Zapper and Wii Wheel without having to remove Wii MotionPlus from the Wii Remote. It competes with the Kinect and the PlayStation Move with PlayStation Eye motion controllers for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 home consoles, respectively. Nintendo later announced that the remote would be available in white, black, blue and pink. It was released in Australia on October 28, 2010, in Europe on November 5, 2010, in North America on November 7, 2010 and in Japan on November 11, 2010. It was also released as part of a bundle containing Wii Sports, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, a red Wii, red Wii Remote Plus and red Nunchuk. It has been announced that the European version of "" will be bundled with the red Wii Remote Plus, while the Black Wii Remote Plus is also included with other versions of the game.
At E3 2011, it was revealed that a gold Wii Remote Plus stylized with a Triforce logo will be released alongside "". It was available as part of a bundle with "Skyward Sword" for a limited time.
Third-party alternatives.
Nyko revealed the Nyko Wand+ at CES 2009, a Wii Remote alternative with the MotionPlus functionality built into the device, saving players from having to change plugins.
In Europe, Snakebyte launched its Premium Remote XL +, with built-in Wii MotionPlus, and its Minimote, a smaller version of the Premium Remote, for children.
Memorex launched a series of controllers in 2011 under the "Game Controller Plus" moniker. Available in black, pink and blue, the Game Controller Plus line has Wii MotionPlus functionality built in.
Reception.
Developers at Electronic Arts have noted that the fidelity of the device can be too sensitive and at times inaccurate, although technology reviewers have likened the improved accuracy to the leap from the fidelity of VHS to that of Blu-ray.
Game reviewers at Official Nintendo Magazine have called the device "100% accurate" and stated that movements are "captured extremely accurately".
In North America, approximately 374,000 Wii MotionPlus units were sold in June 2009 (including nearly 205,000 units sold as part of a bundle with "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10"), according to the NPD Group.
In Japan, the Wii MotionPlus sold approximately 650,000 units in its opening week (including units sold as part of a bundle with "Wii Sports Resort"), with about 296,000 sold as standalone units.

Adolf Fierla

Adolf Fierla (16 January 1908 – 8 September 1967) was a Polish writer and poet from the region of Cieszyn Silesia.
He was born 16 January 1908 in Orlová to a coal miner's family and graduated from the local Juliusz Słowacki Polish Gymnasium. Fierla later studied Polish studies at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and Slavic studies in Prague. He later worked as a teacher of Polish language in Polish elementary schools in Zaolzie and eventually in Polish Gymnasium in Orlová.
When World War II broke up Fierla fled like many other Poles to the east. After his return German Nazi authorities jailed him in 1940 and incarcerated in Dachau and later in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camps. Released from the camp worked as a worker in Pietwałd and in 1944 was forced to join the German Army and was captured in France by the British forces. Fierla then stayed in the Western Europe, initially in Italy, where he taught in lyceum for Polish girls in Porto San Giorgio; in France where he taught in one of Polish gymnasiums, and then from 1958 in the United Kingdom. He continued his literary life there cooperating with Polish press and several other organizations of which he was a member, e.g. Zrzeszenie Ewangelików Polaków w Wielkiej Brytanii (Association of Polish Protestants in the United Kingdom). Fierla died 8 September 1967 in London and is buried in the Finchley district of London.
Fierla wrote his works in literary Polish and also in Cieszyn Silesian dialect. He focused mainly on the life of the Cieszyn Silesia people, especially those of the Beskids mountain ranges and coal basin around the city of Karviná. His works includes many religious motives. Fierla also translated to Polish works of Czech poet Jiří Wolker.
Fierla's typical motive of his native coal mining region can be observed in the "Kopalnie" (Coal Mines) poem from his debut poetry collection "Przydrożne kwiaty" (Roadside Flowers):

UAAP Season 72

UAAP Season 72 is the 2009–2010 season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. It is hosted by Far Eastern University, with opening rites on July 11 at the Araneta Coliseum. The men's basketball tournament and the women's volleyball tournament is being aired by ABS-CBN's UHF Studio 23 for the tenth consecutive year.
Opening Ceremonies.
The opening ceremonies for the 72nd UAAP games was held at the Araneta Coliseum last July 11, 2009. The opening rites featured different student organizations from the host Far Eastern University including other participants from the other 7 UAAP member universities. With the season's theme "One Color. One Goal." the event participants wore white costumes, symbolizing "unity" in the league, introduced the league member universities through flags and the sarimanok, bearing the member schools' respective colors.
Calendar changes.
The schedule of the sporting events will be changed this season. Badminton will be held in the first semester, instead of chess.
Television coverage rights.
With ABS-CBN's contract to broadcast the UAAP expiring on March 31, 2010, two other TV networks are bidding for exclusive television rights for the league, although ABS-CBN has the right of first refusal. Solar Entertainment Corporation's sports section Solar Sports will join the bidding for the TV rights, with a Solar official naming GMA Network as another interested party. The UAAP has been broadcast by ABS-CBN for ten years already at their UHF station Studio 23. UAAP president Anton Montinola said the league considers "to project the league not just nationally but also globally" due to "a lot of followers abroad, mostly alumni". Montinola further said the league has been satisfied with ABS-CBN's coverage of both the basketball and volleyball games. The volleyball tournament was even moved from the first semester (July–October) to the second semester (November–March) to maximize the TV coverage.
Confirming Solar's earlier revelation, GMA has joined the bidding, submitting theirs at a UAAP board meeting on March 19, 2009. In order to strengthen its position, ABS-CBN's bid includes airing the men's basketball championship series at their flagship VHF station Channel 2 instead of airing it on Studio 23, where ABS-CBN has aired the men's basketball tournament for the past nine seasons. Solar will air it on VHF C/S 9 of which they a block-timer. All three submitted five-year bids. GMA will air the games on its VHF channel Q.
Despite the TV rights row on the Pacquiao-Hatton boxing bout between ABS-CBN on one hand and Solar Sports and GMA on the other, Solar has confirmed it will stand by their UAAP bid, with Solar offering a possible linkage either to ABS-CBN's The Filipino Channel (on which the games currently air) or to GMA Pinoy TV to air the games internationally. With ABS-CBN's current contract worth P75 million, Montinola has expressed delight that "there are three TV networks that are very, very much interested to become our partner next season," noting that it is "the first time that this is happening." Montinola clarified that the UAAP is not "rushing things" to determine which among the three networks have the best offer, and declined to comment on the financial offers, saying, "We GMA 7, ABS-CBN and Solar are still far from that discussion."
On October 4, right before the tip-off of Game 2 of the men's basketball finals, the UAAP and ABS-CBN agreed in principle and signed a memorandum of agreement giving the broadcasting network the right to air the league's games for another five-year period starting UAAP Season 73.

Radius of outermost closed isobar

The radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI) is one of the quantities used to determine the size of a tropical cyclone. It is determined by measuring the radii from the center of the storm to its outermost closed isobar in four quadrants, which is then averaged to come up with a scalar value. It generally delimits the outermost extent of a tropical cyclone's wind circulation.
Use of this measure has objectively determined that tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific ocean are the largest on earth on average, with North Atlantic tropical cyclones roughly half their size. Active databases of ROCI are maintained by the National Hurricane Center for systems tracked in the eastern north Pacific and north Atlantic basins.
Database.
Active databases of ROCI are maintained by the National Hurricane Center for systems tracked in the eastern north Pacific and north Atlantic basins, within a database known as the Extended Best Track Database. The values are determined in real-time every six hours. The eastern north Pacific database runs from 2001 to present, while the north Atlantic database runs from 1988 to present. Other than these official databases, a global once-daily dataset was compiled for a 1984 research paper, which covered global tropical cyclones between 1957 and 1977. Previously, a database was created to determine ROCI values for the western north Pacific ocean in 1972, using data from 1945 to 1968. Another database with additional ROCI information is currently being modified at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center for use in matching ongoing tropical cyclones to past systems for the purposes of finding rainfall analogs to an ongoing event, which has fairly continuous data running back to 1959 for the north Atlantic ocean.
Variation.
Tropical cyclones tend to be smaller during the mid-summer, and largest in October in the Northern Hemisphere. As tropical cyclones initially develop, the size of their ROCI initially contracts. As they mature, their isobaric patterns increase in size. An increase in size is also noted as a tropical cyclone gains latitude. As tropical cyclones weaken, their ROCI values diminish. In general, the size of a tropical cyclone shows little relation to its intensity. Use of this measure has objectively determined that tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific ocean are the largest on earth on average, with North Atlantic tropical cyclones roughly half their size.

Helem

Helem () is a Lebanese non-profit organization working on improving the legal and social status of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people (LGBT). Helem (complete name ) is the first LGBT advocacy group in the Arab World. Helem means "dream" in Arabic.
Organization.
Helem (the Arabic acronym of "Lebanese Protection for Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders"), is a non-governmental non-profit organization registered in Quebec (Canada) as of February 11, 2004. As mentioned in Helem's constituting act, its action encompasses Lebanon and Canada. Helem has also established support groups in Australia, France and the United States, in addition to Canada.
Helem is a legal organization recognized in Lebanon. As explained in the Helem website, "according to the Lebanese law of association, any non-government organization can register through providing public notice (in Arabic علم وخبر pronounced as '"ilm wa khabar") to the Lebanese Ministry of Interior.
Goal.
Helem's primary goal is the annulment of article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code which punishes "unnatural sexual intercourse". This law is primarily used to target the LGBT community by violating the privacy of its members and by denying them basic human rights. The abolishment of this law will help reduce state and societal persecution and pave the way to achieving equality for the LGBT community in Lebanon.

The Illustrated Police News

The Illustrated Police News was a weekly illustrated newspaper which was one of the earliest British tabloids. It featured sensational and melodramatic reports and illustrations of murders and hangings and was a direct descendant of the execution broadsheets of the 18th century.
History.
"The Illustrated Police News" was inspired by "The Illustrated London News", which had been launched in 1842 and revealed that newspapers with illustrations could achieve very high sales. First published in 1864, "The Illustrated Police News" ceased publication in 1938.
Its standards of illustration and tone were reminiscent of an earlier publication, "The Newgate Calendar", and the popular "Penny dreadfuls". It gained a reputation for sensationalism during the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.
Around the turn of the 20th century "The Illustrated Police News" ran numerous articles dealing with the "alien immigration question" that promoted xenophobic attitudes and paranoia amongs its mostly working-class readership.
In popular culture.

Aadloun

Aadloun, Adloun or Adlun () is a coastal town in South Lebanon, south of Sidon famous for its cultivation of watermelons. It is also the site of a Phoenician necropolis and prehistoric caves where four archaeological sites have been discovered and dated to the Stone Age. The evidence of human occupation of Abri Zumoffen (or Aadloun I) has been dated as far back as 70,000 BCE with occupation of Bezez Cave (Aadloun II) dating back even further into the earlier Middle Paleolithic.
Aadloun I.
Aadloun I or Abri Zumoffen is a low cave and terrace at the foot of a cliff near a beach. It was discovered and sounded by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1898, 1900 and 1908 who found material thought to be either Acheulean or Mousterian. Dorothy Garrod suggested similarities existed to a final Acheulean (or Yarbrudian) industry of Tabun E. Along with Diana Kirkbride, she re-opened excavations in 1958 with another season in 1963 and found a pre-Aurignacian (Garrod's Amudian) blade industry in the deposits. D. A. Hooijer discussed the fauna of the site suggesting it included game animals and rhino. Materials from the site are now in collections of the Saint Joseph University, Beirut and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge. The site is now owned by the Directorate General of Antiquities but the previous land owner carried out private digging that has spread deposits from the Aadloun II cave site over the area creating a false layer.
Aadloun II.
Aadloun II, Bezez Cave or Mugharet el Bzaz is a cave on the east of the road heading to Tyre set into a cliff at an altitude of approximately above sea level. It was first sounded with little result in 1898 by Godefroy Zumoffen. A major excavation was undertaken in 1963 by Diana Kirkbride and Dorothy Garrod who determined a sequence stretching through the Yarbrudian, Levalloiso-Mousterian, Upper Paleolithic and on into the Heavy Neolithic. Materials from the excavations were to be held by Saint Joseph University and the American University of Beirut. The site is owned by the Directorate General of Antiquities and a gate was fixed over the mouth of the cave for protection. Three distinct levels were determined. Level C was called Acheuleo-Yarbrudian with materials found that resembled level E at Tabun Cave. Level B was called Levalloiso-Mousterian and compared with level D of Tabun. Level C encompassed the Upper Paleolithic and onwards.
Aadloun III.
Aadloun III is a site approximately south of Aadloun with a Chalcolithic (Enéolithique) industry that was found by P. E. Gigues.
Aadloun IV.
Aadloun IV was found by P. E. Gigues on the terraces below the village near the caves that have been damaged by quarrying. Local farmers have recovered several fine Neolithic and Chalcolithic tools from this area that are held by Saint Joseph University. Dr. Gigues collection was held in Beirut by a relative who charged a fee for showing it after his retirement to Morocco.
Materials recovered.
Lorraine Copeland made a collection of mostly Heavy Neolithic flints from the site in 1966. Amongst the finds were massive trapezoidal axes, chisels, a chopper, points, a pick, rough scrapers, blades, cores and hammerstones. The finds led Andrew Moore to suggest that Bezez cave was a factory site for such tools.

Stephen Foster House (Topsfield, Massachusetts)

The Stephen Foster House is a historic house at 109 North Street in rural area of Topsfield, Massachusetts. It is a rare instance of a First Period house (built c. 1680) in which its original footprint is still readily discernable, and has not been obscured by subsequent modifications. The only immediately overt exterior indication of the house's great age is the steep pitch of its roof. It is a 2.5 story wooden house framed with massive oak timbers. It is a "single cell" house, only three asymmetrically placed window bays wide and one room deep, with a chimney on the left side. Its exterior was complete restyled in a 19th-century vernacular style.

Billy Fives

Billy Fives (born May 9, 1969) is an American professional wrestler and former shoot fighter who has competed in North American independent promotions including Combat Zone Wrestling, East Coast Wrestling Alliance, Major League Wrestling and the X Wrestling Federation as well as toured South America, the Caribbean, Saudi Arabia and Japan. He has also made appearances for World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation.
During the late 1990s, he was considered one of the most popular wrestlers in the Florida independent circuit until joining Chris Charger and Wildside (Anthony Michaels and Jeff Roth) to form the ""heel"" stable Animal House which appeared in a number of independent wrestling promotions including Future of Wrestling, Independent Pro Wrestling and NWA Florida. He later became part of Kevin Kelly's Alliance of Defiance stable with Rod Steel, Mike Sullivan and Scoot Andrews.
Career.
Fives was born in Cherokee, North Carolina and later moved to southern Florida where he grew up in Miami Beach. He often watched "Championship Wrestling from Florida" hosted by Gordon Solie and was a later fan of Barry Windham, Rick Steamboat and Ric Flair. He also attended weekly wrestling events at the Miami Beach Convention Center. He graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1987 and attended Mount Aloysius College until 1989.
He studied martial arts during his teenage years, earning six black belts in three disciplines, and was involved in shootfighting. He competed in Japan for three years prior to becoming a professional wrestler. Growing up with Norman Smiley, he was brought into the business by Smiley who was involved in his training at Rusty Brooks' "School of Hard Knocks" along with Brooks, David Heath, Bruno Sassi and others. In April 1997, Fives made his debut against Flex Magnum in Hollywood, Florida.
Fives spent a year in various promotions on the independent circuit until joining Future of Wrestling. Six days after a WWF tryout match at the National Car Rental Center, he accompanied FOW in the promotion's first international tour to Lima, Peru from May 17–25. On May 18, he appeared with Bobby Rogers, Mike Monroe, Marshall Law, The Postman, Cyborg, Phi DeKapp U, Yuel Lovett and his valet Montana on the daytime talk show "The Monica Show". During the next two days, he faced J-Dawg and Anthony Adonis in back-to-back appearances at the Coliseo Amauta. Fives also wrestled on the promotion's weekly television series. He eventually defeated J-Dawg for the FOW International Heavyweight Championship on September 25, 1999. Losing the title three months later to Warlock in Davie, Florida on December 30, that same night he joined Tony Apollo and Anthony Adonis to form the stable FP&L (Florida Power and Lovin') and won the FOW Tag Team Championship from Wildside (Anthony Michaels and Jeff Roth). In January 2000, Fives faced his tag team partner Anthony Adonis on a televised match for Ted DiBiase's WXO Wrestling in Lakeland, Florida. FP&L broke up immediately after losing the tag team titles to Suicidal Tendencies (Dennis and Sean Allen) on February 12.
On March 4, Fives won a battle royal at an event for the Independent Professional Wrestling Association in Homestead, Florida. A month later, he appeared on the April 15th edition of "WWF Jakked" where he faced Essa Ríos in the opening match. He was pinned by Rios after a moonsault. On February 24, 2001, Fives competed in the 2001 Super 8 Tournament in Wilmington, Delaware and lost to Lo Ki in the opening rounds. On April 22, he defeated "Mr. Extreme" Pat McGuire to win the FOW Heavyweight Championship. He would go on to win the title a record 5 times. Two days later at the Homer W. Hesterly Armory, Fives and Pepe Prado represented NWA Florida in a tag team match against Mike Sullivan and Scoot Andrews during an interpromotional event between IPW Hardcore vs. NWA Florida.
He also lost to Scoot Andrews in the tournament finals for the ECWA Heavyweight Championship on May 5. On June 23, he made a second appearance on WWF Jakked losing to Haku. He also made an appearance in Jimmy Hart's X Wrestling Federation where he was one of several wrestlers to compete in a battle royal to decide the first XWF Cruiserweight Champion at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida on November 13, 2001. Among the participants included Psicosis, Juventud Guerrera, A.J. Styles, Low Ki, Prince Iaukea, Christopher Daniels and the winner Kid Kash.
At the end of the year, Fives defeated A.J. Styles for the IPW Heavyweight Championship on December 8, 2001. It was during this time that he formed the stable Animal House with Chris Charger and Wildside (Anthony Michaels and Jeff Roth). The stable was named after Fives' gym in Hollywood, Florida where a number of independent wrestlers trained, most notably, David Babylon and Maximum Capacity.
He and Bruno Sassi defeated the Badstreet Boys (Christian York and Joey Matthews) on February 9, 2002. He also feuded with Scoot Andrews facing him in a memorable ladder match at the 2002 ECWA Super 8 Tournament for his ECWA Heavyweight Championship. On April 12, he successfully defended the FOW Heavyweight Championship in a three-way dance against Adam Jacobs and David Young at Rage in the Cage 4. The next night, he faced his mentor Norman Smiley in a match for the FOW title and lost the belt after submitting to the crossface chickenwing. On May 24, he finally lost the IPW Heavyweight title to Mike Sullivan in Deltona, Florida. The following night he wrestled David Johnson in the opening rounds of a tournament for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship at NWA Florida's NWA Florida: Tradition Is About To Change. He was scheduled to face Mark Briscoe in the opening rounds of the Jersey J-Cup tournament, but was replaced by Shawn Sheridan at the last moment.
On August 10, he also challenged CZW World Heavyweight Champion Justice Pain at "No Excuses". In December, he and Scoot Andrews defeated Sly Grenier and Blake Gale in a dark match on "SmackDown". According to Kevin Kelly, he originally brought Fives to the attention of the WWF after receiving a tape of a three-way match involving Scoot Andrews and Billy Fives. He described showing the tape to then WWF official Terry Taylor,
Although Fives was reportedly in discussions signing with the WWF, he ultimately decided he was not interested in the offer. He was later critical of Vince McMahon's monopoly on the professional wrestling industry following the buyout of World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2001, although he also pointed out that this also gave independent promotions more attention as a result.
In early 2003, he also toured Japan with Riki Chōshū's World Japan Pro Wrestling before returning to face Danny Doring for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship at the interpromotional IPW/NWA Florida supercard "The Aftermath" on January 25. At the last major IPW supercard "Rage in the Cage V", his daughter accompanied him to the ring prior to his match against Agent Steele at the Pinellas Expo Center on April 18.
After the close of IPW Hardcore and Future of Wrestling, he returned to the Florida independent circuit. On June 12, he was defeated in a four-way match against Antonio Banks, Scoot Andrews and NWA Southern Heavyweight Champion Mike Sullivan at the Davie Police Athletic League. The following month at Pro Wrestling Fusion's "Heatstroke '04", he and Scoot Andrews fought over the vacant NWA Southern Heavyweight title at the Davie Police Athletic League complex on August 21. Fives was one of many former wrestlers to find work in NWA Florida and defeated Vordell Walker in one of his first matches in the promotion on October 9, 2004. The next month, he and Lex Lovett lost to Scoot Andrews & Antonio Banks on November 20. while competing for Major League Wrestling that same year, he and other independent wrestlers gained a great deal of exposure in high-profile appearances with the company. His match with Christopher Daniels at "Hybrid Hell" was considered one of the best matches on the card and later released on DVD.
On January 22, 2005, he also teamed with Lovett and Buck Quartermain in a 6-man tag team match against Vordell Walker, Scoot Andrews and Antonio Banks which was declared a no-contest. On February 26, he fought to a 30 minute time limit draw against Mike Sullivan and Scoot Andrews in his retirement match. In June, he appeared at the 3rd annual Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup to present the winner with a trophy. During 2007, he feuded with "The Marquee" Bruce Santee in several Florida independent promotions including Florida United 2 and Division-1 Pro Wrestling.
In early 2011, Bobby Rogers, the owner of the original Future of Wrestling, announced the promotion would be relaunching. At the first show in Davie Florida, Fives won a tournament to be crowned the new FOW Heavyweight Champion, making him a 6 time champion.

<doc id="18434589" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18434589" title="Anniversary Game">
Anniversary Game

The Anniversary Game was a daily syndicated game show that involved three married couples competing for points and prizes by performing stunts and answering questions, à la "Beat the Clock". The host was Alan Hamel, with voice-over artist Dean Webber announcing.
The program was taped in San Francisco at KGO-TV, formerly the home of "Oh My Word".
Game play.
The object of the game was to earn more points than the other couples to win the "anniversary surprise". The first round consisted of each spouse predicting how the other would react to a practical joke or zany gag. If they were correct, the team would win points. 
In the second round, the couples teamed up against each other in order to complete the stunt. The winning team would then receive points. 
In the final round, all the couples competed against one another to answer general knowledge questions (this was not a timed portion of the game; there was no countdown clock as in the "Sale Of The Century" speed round). Point values were determined by a randomly flashing point-value board (see image, right) showing numbered lights with values ranging from 1 to 10 points; a player sounding in to answer pressed his/her button, stopping the flashing sequence on a particular point value. A special 1-point prize (such as a vacation trip) was always at the middle of this board (and rarely hit). The board had three rows each of which had approximately a dozen point values (the middle row was split by the "big 1" space). A player sounding in was recognized by the couple's name and then the point value - e.g., "4 points, Shermans." The team with the most points overall won a merchandise prize called the "anniversary surprise".
Trivia.
One of the prize models during the series run was Suzanne Somers, whom Hamel would marry in 1977.
Episode status.
The series has not been seen since its original run. Its status is unknown, but most likely destroyed.

John Marshall (priest)

John Martiall (Marshall) (born in Worcestershire, 1534, died at Lille, 3 April 1597) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He was one of the six companions associated with William Allen in the foundation of the English College at Douai, in 1568. 
Life.
He received his education at Winchester College (1545–49) and New College, Oxford (1549–56), at which latter place, after a residence of seven years, he graduated as bachelor of civil law in 1556. He next accepted a post as assistant master at his old school at Winchester under Thomas Hyde; but soon after the accession of Elizabeth I of England, both of them found it necessary to quit the country. 
Marshall retired to Leuven, where a number of English Catholic exiles were residing. Thence he removed to Douai, when he joined the new university recently founded there, and graduated B.D. in 1567. Thus it came about that when Allen arrived to found his new college, Marshall was already in residence, and attached himself to the new foundation. He did not, however, remain long, chiefly because of the smallness of the allowance which it was possible to give; later on, he obtained a canonry in the church of St. Peter at the neighbouring city of Lille. Owing to the disturbed state of the country, he was not installed until 1579. He lived to enjoy his dignity for eighteen years. 
Works.
It was during his residence at Leuven that he brought out the two chief literary works for which he is known. The first of these, "Treatise of the Cross" (Antwerp, 1564), was a defence of the honour paid by Catholics to the Cross, and he dedicated it to Queen Elizabeth, being "emboldened upon her keeping the image of a crucifix in her chapel". He was attacked by James Calfhill, the Calvinist, which brought forth his "Reply" (Louvain, 1566). He also wrote a treatise on the "Tonsure of Clerks", which is still in manuscript.

DigitalFusion Platform

DigitalFusion platform is a patent-pending architecture for orchestrating protected über-information sharing across digital ecosystems, developed by privately held DigitalBridge. 
Developed collaboratively with a team led by Bruce Brown, PhD, the platform works across multiple existing disparate enterprises within a digital ecosystem. The platform uses Digital Information Packet solutions to gather data, media, and documents related to a person, place, thing, or event into an intelligent document, legible to both humans and machines. The platform is compliant with the National Information Exchange Model 2.0 (NIEM), which is an XML-based information exchange framework in the United States.
Because trust in the context, integrity, security, and privacy of the information shared within a digital ecosystem is critical to participants, packets collect only what the governance component instructs it to based on the workflow defined by participants. It can find historical information, or collect ongoing transactional data and share it across the digital ecosyste via the DigitalFusion Platform.
The platform allows authorized users to connect using any Web-enabled device to a portal specifically related to their role in the ecosystem. From that portal, they have full access to the information they need for transactions, reports, and analysis. Because each packet is built around the noun—the person, place, thing, or event—associated with a transaction, reports can drill down to the individual or be aggregated in groups depending on needs.
Architecture.
The DigitalFusion technology works with virtually any existing enterprise system. There is no need for organizations to rip and replace existing legacy systems in order to participate in the benefits of the digital ecosystem.

Une voix dans le désert

”Une voix dans le désert" ("A Voice in the Desert") is a recitation, with a soprano soloist and orchestra, written by the English composer Edward Elgar in 1915 as his Op. 77. The words are by the Belgian poet Émile Cammaerts.
It was first produced, in London at the Shaftesbury Theatre, on 29 January 1916, with the recitation by the Belgian dramatic performer Carlo Liten, the soprano Olga Lynn, and an orchestra conducted by the composer.
The words were translated into English by Cammaerts' wife, Tita Brand.
The work was published as a piano reduction (the vocal parts with piano accompaniment) by Elkin & Co. in 1916.
Synopsis.
The reality was horrific. In August 1915 Belgium had been invaded by the German army: the big cities had been destroyed, the carnage on both sides was incalculable and King Albert and his army were driven to the banks of the river Yser in West Flanders.

Thymus pseudolanuginosus

Thymus pseudolanuginosus - commonly called woolly thyme - is now also classified as "Thymus praecox" subsp. "britannicus". It was also formerly known as "Thymus lanuginosus". 
Description.
This low-growing creeping thyme with hairy or woolly leaves and stems, can be quite difficult to delineate between other hairy and non-hairy creeping thymes. It is of unknown specific origin in southern Europe.
The leaves in wild creeping thyme vary from slightly glabrous (smooth) to sparsely covered in white hairs, or thickly covered on both surfaces, with the margins ciliate (hairy), or just ciliate at the base. Leaf hairiness could be an adaptation to climatic conditions, particularly in mountainous regions. 
"Thymus pseudolanuginosus" is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is often grown as a groundcover, where it can form extensive low mats. It is also used in rock gardens

Mais (Bowness)

Mais, or Maia, (with the modern name of Bowness-on-Solway) in Cumbria, England was a Roman fort on Hadrian's Wall, and was the last fort at the western end of the Wall. 
The Notitia Dignitatum does not mention the fort at Bowness on Solway, but the Ravenna Cosmography gives the name of the fort as 'Maia', and the Rudge Cup gives the name as 'Mais'. It is thought that the fort was called 'Maia' meaning 'The Larger' because it was the second largest fort on the Wall. However there is also a possibility that the fort was named after the Greek and Roman goddess Maia.
Description.
The fort stands on a sea-cliff over high, rising steeply from the shore, and commanding lower ground in all directions. The name 'Bowness' means 'rounded headland', indicating the good position of the fort, having commanding views of the nearby coastline. It was built over the site of the eightieth milecastle.
The fort was originally built with a turf and clay rampart, similar to the Turf Wall in that area, but when the Wall was rebuilt in stone, the fort was also rebuilt in stone.
The fort is believed to have measured by , covering about . It is the second largest fort on the Wall, after Stanwix (Petriana). The Wall approached the fort from the east, joining it at the north-east corner. The Wall continued on from the north-west corner, and from there it is uncertain where it went. Old inhabitants reported that, west of the fort a large quantity of stone was dug out of the beach. This may be an indication that the Wall was taken down to the low-tide mark, as it was at Segedunum, at the eastern end of the Wall.
Over the years the cliff face has been eroded, and the north wall of the fort collapsed into the sea long ago. The fort had three gates, east, west and south. There was no need for a north gate as the north wall was on the cliff-tops. 
A civilian settlement, or vicus, existed south of the fort lining the road to Kirkbride, and this was occupied well into the fourth century.
Garrison.
Little is known of the garrison, but its third-century commander was a tribune, indicating that it was probably a thousand-strong (military) cohort of infantry, perhaps part-mounted.
Excavations.
When the site was excavated in 1930, the southern rampart was uncovered and the west gate was located. In 1967, further excavations found the western rampart. In 1973 more extensive excavations were carried out, and traces of the original turf and clay western rampart were found, as well as evidence of a timber gate-tower.

John Norton (divine)

John Norton (May 6, 1606 – April 5, 1663) was a Puritan divine.
Career.
Norton was born at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England. He was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge (BA 1627), and ordained in his native town. He became a Puritan and sailed in 1634 to New England, landing at Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1635. He was 'called' to the new settlement of Ipswich, Massachusetts and ordained 'teacher' there in 1638. 
He was an active member of the convention that formed The Cambridge Platform in 1648, and was a contributor to its drafting. In 1652 he became a colleague of John Wilson at the first church in Boston, where he succeeded John Cotton as minister. In the following years, Norton became a leading opponent of the Antinomians and a chief instigator of the persecution of the Quakers in New England. However, he, along with Wilson, privately opposed the conviction and execution of Ann Hibbins for witchcraft. Mrs. Hibbins was hanged on June 19, 1656. She was the third person to be executed for witchcraft in Boston.
In 1662 he accompanied Governor Simon Bradstreet as agent of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to present an address to King Charles II after his Restoration, and to petition on behalf of New England. The king assured them that he would confirm the charter of the colony, but he required that justice should be administered in his name, and attached other conditions that the colonists regarded as arbitrary. Upon the return of the agents to Massachusetts, they were regarded with suspicion, and the report was circulated that they had sold the liberties of the country. This undermined Norton's popularity as a preacher, and it is supposed that it hastened his death. He died, aged 56, in Boston, Massachusetts.
He was renowned for his scholarship, a prolific author and polemicist. He wrote the first Latin book composed in the Colonies in 1645, which was published three years later in 1648, and his life of John Cotton was the first separately-issued biography to be published there in 1658.

Seán Stack

Seán Stack (born 1953 in Listowel, County Kerry) is a former Irish sportsman. He played hurling with his local club Sixmilebridge and with the Clare senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Stack is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland title.
Up until August 2013 he was a teacher at St. Patricks Comprehensive School in Shannon Co. Clare
Biography.
Seán Stack was born in Listowel, County Kerry in 1953. His father was a native of Kerry while his mother hailed from Glin, County Limerick. Stack spent the first year of his life in Listowel before moving to Glin for three years. In 1957 his father purchased a farm of near Sixmilebridge, County Clare. 
Stack was educated locally and first came to prominence on the hurling field at school and college (St. Patrick's College, Maynooth). He later moved the United States where he spent a number of years working.
Playing career.
Club.
Stack played his club hurling with his local club in Sixmilebridge and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title with the club in 1977. It was the first county championship victory in the history of the club. Stack’s side later played in the Munster club final, however, Blackrock from Cork emerged victorious after a replay. 
Two years later in 1979 Stack won a second county medal. He won two more back-to-back county medals in 1983 and 1984. This latter victory was later converted into a Munster club medal following a 4-10 to 2-6 triumph over Patrickswell. ‘The bridge’ were later defeated by Castlegar in the All-Ireland semi-final. 
1989 saw Stack collect a fifth county medal before lining out in his third Munster club final. For the second time Sixmilebridge were defeated in the provincial decider. 
Stack captured another set of back-to-back county medals in 1992 and 1993. On both occasions ‘the bridge’ reached the Munster final, however, on both occasions he ended up on the losing side. The latter defeat was bittersweet for Stack as his club side were defeated by Toomevara, a club that he was coaching at the time. He retired from club hurling following this defeat.
College.
A Student at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, he represented them in the Fitzgibbon Cup alongside Galways Sean Silke, in an era when Maynooth won the Cup twice, and was runners up twice.
Inter-county.
Stack first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Clare minor hurling team in the early 1970s. He captained the side in 1971 as he lined out in the Munster minor final against Cork. On that occasion ‘the Rebels’ were too good for Clare and trounced Stack’s side by 6-13 to 3-5. 
Stack later joined the county under-21 team. He lined out in the Munster final in that grade in 1972, however, Tipperary won by a single goal. Two years later in 1974 Stack was back in a second under-21 provincial final. Once again Clare looked poised for victory, however, Waterford won by 2-5 to 1-3.
By this stage Stack had already joined the Clare senior hurling team. He made his debut against Galway in a National Hurling League game in late 1973 and made his senior championship debut in 1974. That year Stack lined out in his first senior Munster final. Liemrick, the reigning All-Ireland champions, provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Clare looked likely to make the big breakthrough. Unfortunately, this never materialized and Clare were heavily defeated by 6-14 to 3-9.
Two years later in 1976 Clare made further progress when they reached the final of the National League. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, the game turned into a rout. Stack’s side lost the game by 6-14 to 1-14.
1977 saw Stack lining out in his second consecutive National League final and, once again, it was Kilkenny who were the opponents. At last Clare made the big breakthrough at national level and won the game by 2-8 to 0-9. It was Stack’s first National League medal. Later that summer Clare reached the Munster final and expectations were high. Cork were the opponents on that occasion and an exciting game followed. Once again, Clare’s hopes were dashed as Stack’s side lost the game by 4-15 to 4-10.
In 1978 Stack was appointed captain of the Clare senior hurling team. That year his side reached their third successive National League final with Kilkenny providing the opposition for the third year in-a-row. Stack’s team were now very much in their stride and brushed ‘the Cats’ away by 3-10 to 1-10 giving him a second National League medal. The subsequent Munster final saw Clare take on Cork for the second year in-a-row. Once again the game was an exciting affair, played out in front of 55,000 spectators. On this occasion Clare were the firm favourites, however, Cork were aiming for a third All-Ireland title in-a-row and nothing was going to stop them. ‘The Rebels’ won the game by 0-13 to 0-11 and dashed Stack’s hopes once again.
Three years later in 1981 Clare were back on form and reached the provincial decider once again. Limerick, the reigning champions, were the opponents on that occasion, however, Clare failed to step up to the mark once again. Stack’s side suffered a 3-12 to 2-9 defeat, thus ending Clare’s championship campaign. In spite of this defeat Stack was later presented with a coveted All-Star award.
Five years later in 1986 Stack lined out in his fifth Munster final, however, he had yet to end up on the winning side. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion as they were attempting to capture a record-equaling fifth consecutive provincial title. Once again both sides served up an exciting game, however, for the fifth time Stack was defeated in a provincial decider by 2-18 to 3-12. 
Stack retired from inter-county hurling following a National League game against Wexford in early 1987.
Provincial.
Stack also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1980, however, Connacht were the victors on that occasion. Stack continued to play for his province for another few years and captured two Railway Cup medals in 1984 and 1985.

Huron County Courthouse and Jail

The Huron County Courthouse and Jail is located by a busy downtown intersection in Norwalk, Ohio, USA. The ground floor is composed of rusticated blocks and recessed arched windows. The entrance is reached by a flight of stairs and a protruding portico. Two small windows frame either side of the entrance.
The second floor is made up of smooth masonry blocks with a balcony framed by masonry walls and framed inside with Doric columns. The corner windows are long rectangular panels framed with a decorative border and keystone. The windows by the portico are arched with decorative borders and ketystones. A tower rises from the flat roof and supports a four faced clock. The tower is capped with a colonnaded belfry and an urn on top.
The building now standing is the county's third courthouse, the first and second being destroyed. The current building has reused the foundation and some walls from the second building. The third courthouse was built in 1882 and designed by Vernon Redding. A remodel of the structure occurred in 1913 after a fire destroyed the top floor.
Clock and Bell.
The bell was cast by the McShane Bell Foundry of Baltimore, Maryland in 1913. Inscriptions include name of the bell foundry and the name of the tower clock's maker.
The bell has a pitch of e-flat and its diameter is approximately 30 inches. Currently, the bell is not used due to a deteriorated mounting. The bell is mounted with the ability to swing, however there is currently no rigging to do so. There are plans to restore the bell to working condition in the future.
The tower clock was manufactured by the Seth Thomas Clock Company of Thomaston, Connecticut. Serial number 1829 and the date 7 October 1913 are indicated on the frame. The clock has been modified at some point since installation to run on electricity.

Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)

Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (sometimes Censorinus) was a Roman consul in 133 BC, historian and representative of older Roman annalists. He was of plebeian origin.
In 149 BC he held the office of tribune. During his tribunate he proposed the first law for the punishment of extortion in the provinces, "Lex Calpurnia de Repetundis". In 139 BC praetor, in 133 BC he was elected consul with Publius Mucius Scaevola when he achieved victory over slaves in Italy, but did not subdue them. Probably in 120 BC he was elected censor, therefore some ancient writers called him "Censorinus". He was opponent of Tiberius Gracchus.
He was author of the "Annales", seven books about history of the Rome beginning by its establishment up to Piso's times. Livy considered him less reliable author than Fabius Pictor, because Piso tended to moralize, idealize history and succumb to tendentiousness. The early nineteenth-century iconoclastic historian, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, wrote that Piso was the first Roman historian to introduce systematic forgeries. Only fragments of his works have been preserved, from which we can deduce the simple style of his writing.

American Indian College

American Indian College is a private Christian college located in Phoenix, Arizona. Created for the purpose of "equipping Native Americans for Christian service," AIC currently educates students from about 25 tribes, but now also welcomes students of all ethnicities. It is a regional Assemblies of God college and is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
History.
AIC was established in 1957 as a Bible institute. Over years of Pentecostal ministry, it has changed location three times and has grown into a regionally accredited college offering multiple degree programs. 
In September 2007, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the college's establishment, AIC began a new "Jubilee Walkway" connecting the parking lot with the Henson Memorial Chapel.
Academics.
AIC offers three degree programs: Christian Ministry, in which students may earn either a Bachelor of Arts Degree or an Associate of Arts Degree; Elementary Education, in which students may earn a Bachelor of Arts Degree; and 
Business Administration, in which students may earn an Associate of Arts Degree.
The academic department chairs for each major hold an earned doctorate, and all full-time faculty hold at least a Masters degree in their field. 
As a Christian college where many students major in Christian Ministry, AIC offers its students several opportunities for ministry: Semester outreach programs are offered throughout Arizona, California, and New Mexico; there is an annual four-day trip to Mexico; there are summer ministry traveling teams throughout the country and also abroad; and finally there are also local church opportunities. The Assemblies of God Theological Seminary holds seminars on the AIC campus for students working towards a Masters degree in Christian Ministry.
Campus.
The campus centers around the Alta Washburn multi-purpose building, built in 1972, which houses the Dorothy L. Cummings Library and the John McPherson Education Center. The Henson Memorial Chapel, finished in 1978, is an arrowhead-shaped building that houses both a chapel and the offices of the President, Dean of Students, and Director of Student Services. Most classes take place in the Lee Academic Center. Other notable buildings include the Charles W.H. Scott Student Center, the Rodger Cree Student Union, the Washburn and Gannon Dormitories, and the Ramsey Cafeteria. 
The campus is located in the northwest section of Phoenix, Arizona.
Student life.
Because AIC is a Christian college, all students are required to participate in religious activities regularly. The college requires attendance at all chapel services and weekly dormitory devotions. AIC encourages students to be fully committed Christians in all aspects of life. 
Student organizations include the Associated Student Body, the Campus Missions Fellowship, and the Four Winds yearbook organization. 
Athletics.
AIC lacks a formally organized athletics program. However, there is a gymnasium on campus where students can participate in athletic activities.

Collateralized fund obligation

A collateralized fund obligation (CFO) is a form of securitization involving private equity fund or hedge fund assets, similar to collateralized debt obligations. CFOs are a structured form of financing for diversified private equity portfolios, layering several tranches of debt ahead of the equity holders.
The data made available to the rating agencies for analyzing the underlying private equity assets of CFOs are typically less comprehensive than the data for analyzing the underlying assets of other types of structured finance securitizations, including corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Leverage levels vary from one transaction to another, although leverage of 50% to 75% of a portfolio's net assets has historically been common.
The various CFO structures executed in recent years have had a variety of different objectives resulting in a variety of different structures. These differences tend to relate to the amount of equity sold through the structure as well as to the leverage levels.
Basic Structure of a CFO.
Generally, money is allocated into several different tranches by investors based on priority. A tranche is described as a security that can be divided in to small portions and then sold in those portions to an investor. From the tranches the funds are then invested into a special purpose vehicle (SPV). SPVs are developed solely for the purpose of a CFO.
Private equity CFOs.
Since the advent of CFOs (ca. 2002), there have been only a handful of publicly announced private equity securitization transactions. Typically, owners of private equity assets will securitize a portfolio of funds as a way of generating liquidity without an outright secondary sale of the funds.

1812 Louisiana hurricane

The 1812 Louisiana Hurricane was a major hurricane that struck New Orleans, Louisiana during the War of 1812. It was the worst storm of the early history of New Orleans and is very likely the closest landfalling hurricane known to have an impact on the city. It was first observed in the eastern Caribbean Sea on August 12 as a tropical disturbance, which later affected Jamaica as a tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, it intensified into a hurricane, with winds estimated at over . The circulation affected areas from the Florida Panhandle to Natchez, Mississippi, but the worst effects were in the New Orleans area. There were around 100 deaths, many of them due to drowning.
Meteorological history.
On August 12, a tropical disturbance entered the Caribbean Sea to the south of Antigua, believed to have been a strong tropical wave. Moving westward, it developed into a tropical storm by August 15, based on ship observations in the region. That day, it passed to the south of Jamaica and later turned to the northwest. Due to the ongoing War of 1812, there was a British blockade of American ships, which caused a lack of observations in the region. As a result, the storm's track was uncertain, although it is believed that the system entered the Gulf of Mexico by August 18; that day, a ship reported hurricane-force winds. After moving northward, the hurricane turned to the northwest off the coast of Louisiana.
Although meteorologist David Roth assessed the storm as making landfall on August 19 at Isle Dernière to the west of New Orleans, a research paper from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40 mi (60 km) southeast of New Orleans. Modern research suggests the storm was the equivalent of a major hurricane (a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of at least , when it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was average to slightly below-average, and the forward speed was normal. Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August 20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August 21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.
Impact.
When the storm was moving through the Caribbean Sea, it produced rough seas and heavy rainfall. In Jamaica, gusty winds damaged crops, including to corn and plantains.
As the storm moved ashore in Louisiana, outer rainbands produced gale force winds and heavy damage in Pensacola, Florida. At Cat Island offshore Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, strong winds washed several boats ashore. Hurricane conditions began in New Orleans around 8 p.m. local time on August 19. In southeastern Louisiana, Fort St. Philip sustained heavy damage, after it was flooded. Most soldiers in the fort drowned. There was a rumor during the storm that the British took over Fort St. Philip, causing a panic in the midst of the War of 1812; however, the British fleet was scattered throughout the region, and many British ships were damaged. In New Orleans, the hurricane damaged 53 ships, and several boats were washed ashore along Lake Pontchartrain. The USS Louisiana, a cutter commissioned in 1804, was wrecked during the hurricane while at port in New Orleans, and the entire crew except for the captain was killed. Debris and bodies from the ships were dispersed along the lake's coastline. The USS "Viper" lost its mast while offshore during the storm. Ten people died on the ship "Harlequin".
The storm produced heavy rainfall, along with a powerful storm surge. Flooding up to deep was reported in New Orleans and portions of Plaquemines Parish. In the Parish, 45 people drowned, and there was heavy damage to the sugar crops. The levee system in New Orleans was heavily damaged. The strong waves washed saltwater up the Mississippi River. High winds damaged most buildings in New Orleans, some of which were destroyed, and most trees were blown down. The city's market house was wrecked, despite being described as "indestructible". Damage was estimated at $6 million (1812 USD), and there were around 100 deaths. Further northwest near Natchez, Mississippi, the storm's winds were strong enough to knock down trees. The barometric pressure there was , although the observation was not calibrated and was later corrected to to account for elevation and air temperature.
In the two centuries since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the wetlands around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These have increased the threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Bavarian Maximilian's Railway

The Bavarian Maximilian’s Railway (German: "Bayerische Maximiliansbahn") was as an east-west line built between the Bavarian border with Württemberg at Neu-Ulm in the west via Augsburg, Munich and Rosenheim to the Austrian border at Kufstein and Salzburg in the east as part of the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The Munich–Augsburg section of the line had already been built by the Munich-Augsburg Railway Company and opened in 1840. The line was named after the reigning King of Bavaria from 1848 to 1864 Maximilian II.
History.
Relatively late for a German state, Bavaria decided in around 1851 to complete its major rail links by building an east-west rail link between the German states and Italy via the Brenner railway and via Salzburg to Vienna and the Semmering railway. These lines were expected to be well used, particularly for the connection to the Austrian Adriatic port of Trieste. Treaties agreed with the Kingdom of Württemberg and with the Austrian Empire on 25 April 1850 and ratified in 1851. The route included, the existing line between Augsburg and Munich, completed by the former private "Munich-Augsburg Railway Company" in 1840.
The line began at the Württemberg and Bavaria border in the middle of the newly built bridge over the Danube between Ulm and Neu-Ulm, and ran for about 85 km to Augsburg. In Ulm, it connected with the Württemberg Eastern railway to Stuttgart and the Southern railway to Friedrichshafen.
From Munich, the line ran for over 106 km over the route now known as the Mangfall Valley line via Großhesselohe and Rosenheim to Kufstein, where it connected with the Austrian Lower Inn Valley line. The Salzburg line branched off in Rosenheim and ran for 83 km via Traunstein to the border near Salzburg.
Construction.
Under a Bavarian law of 4 May 1851 work started on the western section. The 83.7 km long line opened in four sections:
Construction of the eastern section was regulated by the Bavarian Law of 7 May 1852. The 188 km long line opened in five sections:
The three years delay in continuing the line from Großhesselohe to Rosenheim was due to the complicated construction of the great 300-metre bridge over the Isar valley there. The foundation work for the bridge foundations and its three 30-meter piers started in 1852. The heavy traffic on the first section led to building of a second track in 1862. From 1871, this section of the line lost its long distance services after the opening of the shorter route via Grafing.

She was the winner of the 1500 metres at the World Junior Championships in 2008, and is a three-time winner of the European Cross Country Championships junior women's race as well as being part of four winning Great Britain teams.
Career.
Her personal best time for the 1500 metres is 4:02.70, set in Barcelona, Spain on 1 August 2010. She competed in the women's 1500 metres at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and came sixth in her heat, with the 11th best time overall, out of 33 competitors.
In September 2008, Twell was named European Athletics Rising Star of 2008. In January 2009 she was named "Telegraph Ten for 2012" - 10 of Britain's brightest young sports stars in "The Daily Telegraph".
She began the 2009 cross country season well, winning at the Antrim International Cross Country. A few months later, Twell finished 38th in the 2009 World Cross Country Championships in Jordan. Although she was the fastest Briton in the race, she was disappointed with her performance and stated that she resolved to do better in the next championships.
She set a new personal best in the 5000 metres in May 2009, winning the Artur Takac Memorial in 15:18.47 – a meeting record.
She had a disappointing run at the 2009 European Team Championships over 3000 m, finishing in fourth in a time well outside her PB. At the 2009 World Championships she was never in contention in her heat at 1500 m and then when one of the favourites she was only 11th in the European Cross Country Championships (under 23 race).
Her 2010 was marked by improvements in her personal bests on the track. She set a 1500 metres best at the Weltklasse Zurich Diamond League meeting, finishing third and ahead of Lisa Dobriskey with a time of 4:02.54. Stepping up to the 5000 m at the Memorial van Damme in Brussels, she smashed her previous best by 22 seconds to set a new Scottish record of 14.54.08, breaking Yvonne Murray's 15-year-old mark. She ran at the Women's 5K Challenge in London in August 2010 and took third place behind Sylvia Kibet and Linet Masai. Reflecting on the race, she said: "To run 15:32 is great for me and third was just what I aimed for."
Twell suffered a fractured ankle competing in a cross-country race in Belgium in February 2011. A further foot injury in June 2012 ended her hopes of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

An ell was added onto the rear of the house in the late 18th century, and a shed-like wing was added to the west rear in the 19th century. Later in the 19th century a single story kitchen wing was added onto the ell.

George Tibbits (composer)

George Richard Tibbits (7 November 19336 July 2008) was an Australian composer and architect.
Tibbits was born in Boulder, Western Australia, to a family of mining prospectors, and when his father returned wounded from the First World War, the family moved to Colac, Victoria, to take up dairying. He studied architecture at the University of Melbourne, and eventually taught urban studies and architectural history there and established the urban studies program. He initiated the first heritage conservation study, the Beechworth Historical Reconstruction Project. He was also prominent in opposing the former Housing Commission's slum reclamation project in inner Melbourne. 
He was not formally trained in music and worked outside of the main channels of art music production in Australia. At age 16 he wrote his first major work, "Otway Ranges Symphony". His early works show the influence of his interest in the music of Indonesia, as well as American modernists such as Milton Babbitt and John Cage. He would often jot down pieces of tunes while travelling on public transport. Late in the 1950s, he concentrated on works depicting what he referred to as the 'brutalist' aspects of urban civilization, but by the 1960s had returned to a more lyrical style. He became more interested in rock and pop music after a 1965 trip to England to work on urban planning. Later compositions incorporate elements of parody and collage. He set some poems by Vin Buckley to music for soprano and orchestra, as "Golden Builders". "1976" was a setting of a 1906 newspaper article describing a massacre of aborigines in Gippsland. He wrote 45 works in total, and all but one were given performances by professional orchestras or chamber groups. They include 5 string quartets, an octet for wind called "Battue", and other works.
In 1975 he won the Albert H. Maggs Composition Award.
Tibbitts died in 2008, aged 74. Ten days before his death, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Architecture by the University of Melbourne.

High Street Cemetery

High Street Cemetery is a historic cemetery at 45 High Street in Danvers, Massachusetts. The cemetery is one of the older cemeteries in town, and occupies a prominent location in the town center.
The cemetery was first used sometime in the 18th century; the oldest dated gravestone bears the date 1758, for the wife of Amos Putnam. The parcel was formally deeded for use as a private burying ground in 1805. Its early documented burials include a number of American Revolutionary War veterans, the most notable of which was Samuel Page, a Continental Army captain who later became a local businessman, politician and merchant shipowner.
Although the cemetery was at laid out in a fairly rural area, it developed in the first half of the 19th century to become the town center, and the cemetery was soon hemmed in by development on all sides. In 1870 the town voted to acquire the cemetery, and closed it to further use except to those who (according to the 1805) had customarily used it. The last new burial took place in 1875; several graves (particularly some of those of Revolutionary War veterans) were relocated here from other burial grounds in 1929.
The protective wall around the cemetery has its own distinctive history. According to the 1805 deed, the cemetery was supposed to be surrounded by a fence at least high, and was documented as having recently been so enclosed. The cemetery was describe in 1848 has being surrounded by a mortared stone wall, but it did not meet the required height. There is some evidence that the wall was once topped by iron fencing, but whether this predates to the town's purchase or not is unknown. Early 20th century images of the cemetery show a picket fence on High Street. The wrought iron gate carries a date of 1843, but was not described in the 1848 history.
The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Because of the number of veterans' graves in the cemetery, it is a focal point of local Memorial Day commemorations.

Great Edstone

Great Edstone is a small village located in the North York Moors, about north of York. It sits on an isolated hill close to the River Dove.
Great Edstone was a key place for evacuees to stay during World War II, as can be seen in the still remaining village hall. In the 1970s/1980s the school was removed since there were not enough children in the village. Since then, the village has decreased in size and presently all that remains is about 30-50 houses a church, village hall, post box and a telephone box. However the village continues to grow in population as new houses are built; and it has recently seen an increase in the number of young families.
The major residential street of Great Edstone is the Wapping, upon which many of the houses are built. Throughout the area, the feeling of community is strong and people do tend to help each other wherever possible. The church is open regularly and really is worth a view, while the views from the door are breathtaking. 
The Beginning
The hill upon which Great Edstone was built was formed by glaciers in about 30,000 B.C. While the Ice Age melted, the hill was left to be an island in the middle of a lake which covered the Vale of Pickering (to be clarified)- which itself receded once all trace of the Ice Age left. When the ice did melt, the fertile soils of the land are likely to have encouraged farming.
The Buildings and Features of Great Edstone Village 
The most prominent and perhaps the oldest building is The Manor House, a house visible from many miles away.

Robert Lock Graham Irving

Robert Lock Graham Irving (17 February 1877 – 10 April 1969), was an English schoolmaster, writer and mountaineer. As an author, he used the name R. L. G. Irving, while to his friends he was Graham Irving.
Life and family.
Irving was the son of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. He returned to Winchester as a master, teaching French and mathematics and becoming 'Master in College', in charge of the ancient house for the holders of foundation scholarships, and founded a climbing group known as the Winchester Ice Club.
He had a son, Robert Irving (1913–1991), and a daughter, Clare. His son became a distinguished conductor and was musical director of the New York City Ballet, 1958 to 1989, as well as following in his father's footsteps as an amateur mountaineer. In 1991, his daughter's name was Clare Peters.
Irving died on 10 April 1969, a few months into his ninety-third year.
Mountaineering.
In "The Romance of Mountaineering", Irving writes that he was introduced to mountains at an early age: "My earliest recollections of a summer holiday centre round the ascent of a Welsh hill." Several years later he began exploring the hills on his own:
Irving became a member of the Alpine Club in 1902 and was an advocate of climbing without a mountain guide, which in those days was thought by some to be reckless, but which Irving undertook "on account of boredom being guided and expense". His climbing partner – a fellow Winchester schoolmaster – having been killed in a fall early in 1904, Irving went on a solitary climbing trip to the Sierra Nevada in the Easter vacation of that year. Finding the experience unsatisfactory – "If you climb for novelty and excitement solitary climbing is the kind to satisfy you; but if you climb for recreation of mind and body it is a failure" – he was left looking for new people with whom to climb during the summer of 1904. He took to finding companions – he called them "recruits" – for his alpine trips from within the ranks of seventeen- and eighteen-year-old boys at Winchester College, the enlistment of the first of whom (Harry Gibson)
The second of these recruits was "a special friend of the first was soon enlisted, and the planning of the campaign began". This was the seventeen-year-old George Mallory, a mathematics scholar at Winchester who later disappeared on the to Mount Everest. As Irving later remarked, "It was just chance that I took out to the Alps in 1904 a boy destined to become so famous on Everest." Much of Irving's fame derives from his being the person who introduced Mallory to mountaineering. Aside from Gibson and Mallory, who both went on the first trip in 1904, other members of the Winchester Ice Club were Guy Bullock (who reached Mount Everest's North Col in 1921) and Harry Tyndale.
According to Irving's address to the Alpine Club, entitled 'Five Years with Recruits', the Ice Club's series of controversial expeditions to climb some of the highest mountains in the Alps began in 1904, and peaks such as the Grand Combin, Dent Blanche, Aiguille du Blaitière, Bietschhorn, Aiguille de Bionnassay, Grunhorn, Mittaghorn, Aletschhorn, Monte Rosa and Mont Blanc were successfully ascended. Rock climbing trips were also undertaken to Snowdonia, using the Pen-y-Gwryd hotel as a base, and snow craft was practised in the Scottish Highlands in winter. 
The feelings of the Alpine Club towards the leading of boys up potentially dangerous mountains were expressed in a 'Condemnation', in which Tom George Longstaff stated that he "did not think that members would agree with him about the advisability of such expeditions". This was followed by 'A Disclaimer', published in the "Alpine Journal" for 1909 and signed by such luminaries as Longstaff, Geoffrey Winthrop Young, Claud Schuster, W. P. Haskett Smith and D. W. Freshfield, in which these members of the club, and nine others, ' to place on record that we disclaim responsibility for any encouragement which Mr. Irving's paper may give to expeditions undertaken after the manner therein described'. However, as Claire Engel wrote in 1971, "it seems that Irving's methods have been adopted by various organisations."
Irving continued to climb with Mallory after the latter had left Winchester; in 1911 Irving led Mallory and another of his ex-pupils, Harry Tyndale, on the third ascent of the Kuffner (or Frontier) ridge on Mont Maudit. According to Helmut Dumler, Mallory was "apparently prompted by the death of friends on the Western Front in 1916 write a highly emotional article of his ascent of this great climb"; this article was published as 'Mont Blanc from the Col du Géant by the Eastern Butress of Mont Blanc' in the "Alpine Journal".
Irving's book "Ten Great Mountains" (1940) sets out the climbing history up to then of Snowdon, Ben Nevis, Ushba, Mount Logan, Everest, Nanga Parbat, Kanchenjunga, the Matterhorn, Mount Cook and Mont Blanc.
Irving kept up to date with mountaineering developments in the Greater Ranges, writing of the Muztagh Tower (7,273 m) in the Karakorum that it was "Nature’s last stronghold – probably the most inaccessible of all the great peaks, its immense precipices show no weakness in its defence".
In a pamphlet called "The Mountains Shall Bring Peace" (1947), Irving describes the benefits he has had from his own climbing and proposes greater participation in mountaineering as a way to achieve international brotherhood and peace.

Munich–Augsburg Railway Company

The Munich–Augsburg Railway Company ("München-Augsburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft"), the second private railway company in Bavaria, built the Munich–Augsburg line between 1838 and 1840. It was nationalised in 1846 and became part of the Royal Bavarian State Railways, subsequently forming part of the Bavarian Maximilian’s Railway built between 1851 and 1854.
Foundation and Construction of the Railway.
After the opening of the first private railway in Bavaria, the Bavarian Ludwig Railway from Nuremberg to Fürth on 7 December 1835, local committees for the construction of railway lines grew up all over Bavaria. The two committees in Augsburg and Munich soon united and had a civil servant draw up a route proposal. The task of carrying out the detailed planning and construction was given to the engineer, Paul Camille Denis, who had just completed the Nuremberg-Fürth line.
After the state had issued the "Basic Regulations for All Railway Statutes in Bavaria" ("Fundamentalbestimmungen für sämtliche Eisenbahnstatuten in Bayern") on 28 September 1836, the Munich–Augsburg Railway Company was founded on 23 July 1837. On 3 July 1837, they had already been given the royal assent. However there were difficulties with the shareholder applications in the early days as a result of delays in obtaining the state licence. Nevertheless, the construction of the railway got under way at the beginning of 1838. 
The line, which was almost long, was opened to traffic in four stages:
For over 20 years, the river Lech was crossed by a long wooden bridge. It is reported that King Ludwig I directed that the final opening ceremony would coincide with the beginning of the Oktoberfest.
Locomotives.
The company procured a total of eight locomotives from various manufacturers that were all fired with wood. All had interior cylinders and a 1A1 axle arrangement.
Nationalisation.
By a law dated 23 May 1846, the Munich–Augsburg Railway Company was nationalised on 1 June 1846 and taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen"). The state paid the shareholders 4.4 million gulden.

Cyrtonybyoceras

Cyrtonybyoceras is a slightly exogastric member of the Wutinoceratidae, a family of actinocerids and probably derived from an earlier "Wutinoceras" . The shell of "Cyrtonybyoceras" is curved slightly upwardly and is slightly compressed. Sutures slope toward the aperture, from the dorsum to the venter. The siphuncle is ventral but not marginal, in general form like that of "Nybyoceras". Upper and lower septal necks are recumbent or narrowly free. The canal system is reticular, characteristic of the Wutinoceratidae. 
Cyrtonybyoceras and Wutinoceras are similar, except for Cyrtonybyoceras being slightly cyrtoconic, and almost intergrade. 
Cyrtonybyoceras is so far known only from the Whiterock Stage in North America. The genotype, "Cyrtonybyoceras haesitans" was named by Teichert in 1933, based on "Orthoceras haesitans" Billings 1865, from the Tablehead formation in Newfoundland. Cyrtonybyoceras has also been found in the Antelope Valley Limestone in the Toquima Range in Nevada.

"Out for the Cash" is a single and posse cut from DJ Honda's eponymous 1996 album. It was released by Relativity Records as a 12 inch in the United States and by Sony Music Entertainment as a CD single in Japan. The song features raps by the three original Beatnuts, as well as Fat Joe and Problemz. The song's lyrics are braggadocios and discuss the pursuit of attaining money. The song's beat, produced by turntablist DJ Honda, is reliant on pounding drums and a mournful soul sample. DJ Honda scratches a vocal sample from his song "Straight Talk from NY" onto "Out for the Cash". "Out for the Cash" is different from the DJ Honda song "Out for the Cash (5 Deadly Venoms)," also known as "Pre of Cash."
"Out for the Cash" failed to chart, but nonetheless was turned into a music video by director Nick Quested. The song is featured on two hip hop compilation albums: 1996's "Relativity Urban Assault" and 1998's "Crucial Rap".

Hugh Mendl

Hugh Rees Christopher Mendl (August 6, 1919, London – July 7, 2008) was a British record producer, A&R representative, and manager who worked for Decca Records for over 40 years.
Mendl attended Radley College and then University College, Oxford, where he studied history. After falling in love with jazz music in the late 1930s, he abandoned his career in foreign affairs for sound recording and reproduction. Mendl's grandfather, who was chairman of the Decca Gramophone Company, landed him his first position in the business. During World War II he worked as an announcer for jazz radio in Jerusalem and on news broadcasts in the Mediterranean. He applied for a job at the BBC after the war but soon returned to Decca. He worked as a "song plugger" in the late 1940s, and began producing in 1950, working early in his career with Reggie Goff (his first recording), Winifred Atwell (producing her classic recording of "Black And White Rag") and Josh White.
Mendl produced Lonnie Donegan's first recordings, which were pivotal in defining the new skiffle sound of the 1950s. His production credits covered a wide variety of styles—he also produced the original cast recordings of musicals such as "Hello, Dolly!", "Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be", "Oh! What a Lovely War" and "Cinderella", a set of speeches by Winston Churchill, comedy/satire albums by Ivor Cutler and Frankie Howerd and even an LP of the Le Mans 24-hour race, inspired by his lifelong passion for motor racing.
Mendl encouraged Decca to sign rising Liverpool band The Beatles in 1962 but they were famously turned down by executive Dick Rowe. As a result of that historic mistake, Decca executives began paying more attention to Mendl's advice and he is credited with recommending several other of the company's most important signings including The Rolling Stones (for which Rowe ultimately took credit), David Bowie, Genesis, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and Caravan. 
In the mid-1960s Mendl was instrumental in the establishment of Decca's new 'progressive' subsidiary label Deram and he championed Deram's biggest act, The Moody Blues and acted as executive producer for the Moody Blues album "Days of Future Passed" (1967). Through his efforts, David Bowie, John Mayall, Caravan, and Genesis signed with Decca, although the records of some of these artists appeared on the Deram imprint. He gave the Moody Blues the support that enabled them to evolve from a struggling 'beat-pop' act into a full-fledged progressive rock group and he offered them a deal to record a lavish orchestral concept album that would promote the company's DSS stereo sound system, in exchange for which Decca wiped the band's debts, which by then amounted to several thousand pounds. Mendl also backed the group's groundbreaking demand for complete artistic control over the resulting album, "Days of Future Passed", recorded with the London Festival Orchestra, and for which he acted as executive producer, as well as writing the liner notes.
Mendl was well known for his "massive contempt" for Decca's rival EMI, which he described as having "all of the arrogance of the BBC without any of the education", but his obituary noted that he largely stood apart from the often bitter and divisive office politics at Decca, where staff were habitually played off against each other by Edward Lewis.
Mendl suffered a heart attack at an industry Christmas party in December 1979, which he blamed on the stress of "working for a dying company". During his convalescence Sir Edward Lewis died, and a few weeks later Decca was taken over by Polygram. When Mendl returned to work, he discovered that his office had been cleaned out on the orders of the new proprietors and all his diaries—which would have provided a unique insight into the company's operations—had been thrown away.
He left the company soon after and quit the music business, retiring to Devon, where he ran an antiques shop.

Louis Marie Cordonnier

Louis-Marie Cordonnier (July 7, 1854, Haubourdin, Nord – 1940) was a French architect, born in Haubourdin and associated principally with Lille and the French Flanders region.
Biography.
Son of the architect Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier (1820–1902), Cordonnier studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He returned to Lille for his first major commission, the 1881 town hall of Loos. His chosen style was a strongly regional Flemish Renaissance Revival in brick, with a characteristic belfry tower. 
Further civic commissions in the area culminated in Cordonnier's best known work, the Peace Palace in The Hague, seat of the International Court of Justice. There his neo-Flemish entry won a design competition against far more modern competitors like Hendrik Berlage and Otto Wagner. The jury's choice proved controversial enough to fuel lawsuits for seven years.
Cordonnier alternated his regional Flemish style with occasional essays in the neo-classical Beaux-Arts style so prevalent in Paris during these years. In Lille the architect's Flemish Chamber of Commerce building of 1910-1921 stands twenty paces away from his Beaux-Arts Opéra de Lille of 1903-1914, its design said to be inspired by Garnier's Paris Opera. 
In the wake of the widespread destruction of World War I in this part of France, Cordonnier took the lead in efforts to rebuild civic buildings and local churches in strictly traditional style, although not averse to using structural concrete. Towards the end of his career he was joined in practice by his son, Louis-Stanislas Cordonnier (1884–1960).

Afghan Red Crescent Society

The Afghan Red Cross Society (ARCS) is the Afghan affiliate of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The Society has existed for over 70 years although with limited structure due to the prevailing conditions which have affected the country at large for over 20 years.
History.
The ARCS was founded in April 1934. It traces its origins to the Naderia Orphanage, with the purpose of helping orphans and those in need. In October 1951, the society adopted its constitution, which articulated democratic provisions for membership, elections at central, provincial and local branches, and managing board. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is one of the two main partners of the ARCS, establishing its delegation in Afghanistan in 1991, with only temporary evacuations during the most recent conflict. Although limited in terms of organizational capacity in recent years, the organization and activities of the ARCS covers territory throughout the country, with active branches in 31 of 32 provinces.
Organization and activities.
The ARCS receives a significant portion of its support from the National Societies of several developed nations, including those from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Japan, with support channeled through the International Federation. The ARCS also maintains bilateral relations with the National Societies of Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The ARCS has been led by Ms. Fatima Gailani since 2004.
Based on its wide-ranging humanitarian work throughout Afghanistan, the ARCS claims the ability to work with all ethnic groups through its services. The primary activities of the organization have been focused primarily on disaster response, health care, and youth. Although exact figures are currently unavailable, a 2003 release from the International Federation placed members/volunteers at approximately 10,000 with 1,200 staff. Ms. Fatima Gailani claims, in a 2007 interview with the International Review of the Red Cross that the ARCS has nearly 37,000 volunteers.

USS Lydonia (SP-700)

USS "Lydonia" (SP-700) was a 497 gross ton yacht, "Lydonia II", acquired from William A. Lydon by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was outfitted as a patrol craft and spent most of the war based out of Gibraltar, escorting and protecting Allied ships in the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic Ocean coast of Europe. Post-war she was transferred to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey as USCGS "Lydonia" (CS-302).
Construction.
"Lydonia II" was the second yacht of the name built by Pusey and Jones, Wilmington, Delaware as hull #348 under contract #1205 for William A. Lydon, Commodore of the Chicago Yacht Club, and was more than 250 tons larger than the "Lydonia I" completed just two years earlier. The ship was designed by William A. Gardner with construction started in early April 1911 and launch on 25 July 1911. Fitting out took nine months with sea trial on 1 May 1912. She was described as "queen of the Great Lakes fleet" and "the finest on the Great Lakes."
World War I service.
The ship was acquired by the Navy 21 August 1917 from William A. Lydon; and commissioned as USS "Lydonia" (SP-700) 27 October 1917, Lt. Cmdr, R. P. McCullough in command.
Based out of Gibraltar.
After repairs and target practice off Bermuda, the converted yacht departed the Caribbean in mid November and arrived Horta, Azores, 7 December 1917. Two weeks later she arrived Gibraltar to join the U.S. patrol squadron operating along the Atlantic and Mediterranean sides of the Straits of Gibraltar.
Assigned the task of protecting Mediterranean supply convoys, "Lydonia" remained on constant vigil for deadly U-boats during the early. months of 1918. She made two attacks on enemy submarines in February while guarding Allied convoys and although the results were negative. the experience was to pay off at a later date.
Encountering U-boat UB-70.
On 8 May, "Lydonia" was steaming with a convoy from Bizerte to Gibraltar when she encountered German submarine "UB-70". With the British destroyer "Basilisk", the patrol craft made coordinated depth charge attacks at 1735, after the British merchant ship "SS Ingleside" was destroyed by a torpedo. After 15 minutes of running battle, the attack was curtailed and survivors of "Ingleside" were rescued. Heavy seas prevented an immediate assessment of possible damage to the submarine, but later evaluations credited "Lydonia" and "Basilisk" with sinking "UB 70".
End-of-war operations.
For the rest of the war, "Lydonia" continued escort operations from Bizerte to Gibraltar, playing a major role in the free movement of vital wartime supplies. Calling in Azores and Caribbean ports en route to the United States, she arrived Hampton Roads, Virginia, 6 February 1919. 
Post-war disposal.
"Lydonia" decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, 7 August 1919 and was transferred to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey the same day.
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey service.
Commissioned into the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1919 as USC&GS "Lydonia", "Lydonia" operated as a survey ship until 1947.

Manuel Felguérez

Manuel Felguérez Barra (born December 12, 1928) is a prominent abstract artist of Mexico, part of the Generación de la Ruptura which broke with the muralist movement of Diego Rivera and others in the mid 20th century. Felguérez was born in Zacatecas in 1928, but political instability caused his family to lose their land there and move to Mexico City. In 1947, he had the chance to travel to Europe and impressed with the art there, decided to dedicate himself to the vocation. Unhappy with the education at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico, he did most of his studies in France, where he specialized in abstract art, something that was not accepted in Mexico at the time. His exhibitions were initially limited to galleries and the production of “sculpted murals” using materials such as scrap metals, stones and sand. As attitudes in Mexico changed towards art, Felguérez found acceptance for his work and remains active at over eighty years of age.
Life.
Manuel Felguérez was born on his family’s San Agustín del Vergel hacienda near Valparaíso, Zacatecas in 1928. It was a turbulent time as Zacatecas was involved in the Cristero uprising and while the fighting initially began over religion, it quickly become about land as well. His father owned the family hacienda, the great great grandson of landholders, but by the early 20th century, these landowners were despised by the general populace. Various of the hacienda’s workers demanded control of the land by force, with battles between loyalists and the insurgents on the property. In the 1930s, there were land expropriations under Lázaro Cárdenas, which took away most of the family’s holdings. The family decided to flee and later completely abandon the hacienda in 1934 for Mexico City. Felguérez’s father hoped for compensation for the lost lands from the federal government, but he died after a year when Felguérez was only eight years old. Felguérez’s mother never returned to Zacatecas, warning her son that if he ever returned to Valparaíso, they would kill him, and she also preferred to be with her parents in the capital city. Felguérez would return about six decades later to Zacatecas for the first time to open an art museum named after him.
Felguérez grew up with his mother and her family, which owned the Ideal Theater on Dolores Street in Mexico City. The change from rural farm life to city life was essential to his development. The family had a number of financial downturns, first losing the theatre then losing a grocery store they opened after only two years, making the family poor. There was pressure to join gangs and rob, he liked to box and see lucha libre at the Arena México and tried marijuana in his youth (he favors its legalization today. However, he received his primary, secondary and high school education through the Marists and was a Boy Scout from age eight to age twenty three with his best friend Jorge Ibargüengoitia . The Scouts encouraged him to read authors such as Dostoyevsky and G. K. Chesterton and took hiking trips including one to Iztaccíhuatl .
Scouting also gave him the opportunity to travel to Europe in 1947 just after the end of World War II when the cultural scene was recovering. His intention was to go with Ibargengoitia for a jamboree, but the trip cost 5000 pesos which he could not pay. The two found a way for cheaper passage and got the France on their own, angering the Mexican Scout leadership, who expelled them. They then decided to hitchhike around various countries including Italy, Switzerland, France and England, staying at houses of Scouting contacts and visiting museums. Although his mother wanted him to be a doctor, he was impressed by the European art he saw, especially that of English painter William Turner and announced to Ibargengoitia that he would become an artist. Although Ibargengoitia laughed at the time, he later write that he felt that this is when Felguérez’s vocation began.
He entered the Academy of San Carlos in 1948, but lasted only four months as he did not like its conformity with the dominant artistic movement in Mexico called the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura . He decided to go back to Europe along with his friend Jorge Wilmot. To get the money, they went to the La Huasteca and other areas to find archeological pieces to sell. At that time, there was not the consciousness that they were part of Mexico’s heritage. He studied at the Grande Chaumière Academy in Paris, under French-Russian Cubist artist Ossip Zadkine, who became his mentor.
He returned to Mexico in 1950 for family reasons and between then and 1954, he studied for a bachelors in anthropology and history as well as taking classes in modern art at Mascarones and studying the craft of terracotta at La Esmeralda with Francisco Zúñiga. He met his first wife, Ruth Rohde in 1951. Their families would not let them marry so they eloped. Later to appease the families, they married again in the Catholic Church. He tried to sell sculptures made in his workshop, without success, but did make some money making designing lamps for Enrique Anhalt. He and his first wife moved to Puerto Escondido and had a store selling handcrafts .
In 1952, he obtained a scholarship from the French government to study again in Paris at the Colarossi Academy .
He returned to France which his wife and daughter, with a large studio in the Casa de Mexico, where he met Lilia Carrillo, who was then married to Ricardo Guerra. He divorced his first wife in 1959, with two children and soon afterwards married Carrillo. They remained married until Carrillo died in 1974, five years after a ruptured aneurism in her back left her paralyzed. He married his current wife Mercedes Oteyza shortly after that.
Over his lifetime he has done a variety of work in addition to art, sometimes out of necessity. It includes taxidermist, anthropologist, artisan, researcher and teacher. He was a university professor, retiring after thirty years, and never depended in art sales to live. As a teacher, his most important focus is to teach students to be original. He states that it is hard for him to sell his work and sometimes large quantities of pieces can accumulate without sale.
The artist is still activity working, and has no plans to retire except in the case of physical disability. He has homes in Colorado and the Olivar de los Padres neighborhood of Mexico City, as well as a workshop at the Abstract Art Museum in Zacatecas.
Career.
His career has included painting, planning sculptures, thirty years as a professor, work in theatre and cinema and handcraft design. He has had over 250 individual exhibitions and over 1,500 with other artists. He feels his most significant work has been his sculpted murals and public sculptures. He is classified as a member of the Generación de la Ruptura along with Vicente Rojo, Rodolfo Nieto, José Luis Cuevas, Alberto Gironella, Lilia Carrillo, Francisco Corzas, Fernando García Ponce and Arnaldo Coen, following the more abstract style pioneered by Carlos Mérida, Cordelia Urueta, Günther Gerzso and Juan Soriano. As a member of the group he faced both political and artistic stigma. He is also associated with other writers and artists of his generation including Juan Rulfo, Octavio Paz, Juan Jose Gurrola, Alejandro Jodorowski, Alejandro Galindo and Alberto Isaac .
He works in both painting and sculpture, specializing in combining sculpture as mural, creating sculpted murals in metal for public and private buildings. Most of these were done early in his career which thirty relief murals using materials such as scrap metal, stones, sand and shells finished by the end of the 1960s. Some of the more important works of this type are at the Diana Theater and the Bahía water park. The “Mural de chatarra” (Mural of junk) was made for the Diana Cinema and was considered by the press to be a provocation as it did not refer to the Mexican Revolution and the people of Mexico. A later work was the tzompantli-mural for the Museo Nacional de Antropología .
In the late 1950s and during the 1960s, abstract art was not accepted by Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura and Felguérez was mostly limited to exhibiting in galleries. His art was supported by artists such as Jomi, Juan Martin and Juan Garcia Ponce and heavily criticized by Raquel Tibol, Jorge González Camarena and Juan O’Gorman. He supported the Cuban Revolution in 1960, which hurt his career in the United States as his visa was canceled for being a “communist.” He was able to visit Cornell University in 1966 but only under special invitation and similarly when he received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975.
His first exhibition was in 1954 at the Insituto Francés de América Latina, where he was favorably received by Justino Fernández, Paul Westheim and Mathias Goeritz. It was the only exhibition where he has sold all of his displayed works and earned him a scholarship to return to France. His first individual exhibition was in 1958.
Since then, major exhibitions include the I and II Biennials in Paris, the VI in São Paulo, the IV in Tokyo and the XX Biennial in Watercolors at the Brooklyn Museum, the I Bienal de escultura in Mexico City (1962), Confrontación 66, Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City (1966), Mexico Today at the Mexican Museum in San Francisco (1978), México ayer y hoy at the Petit Palais in Paris (1981), Libro objeto at the Galería Juan Martín in Mexico City (1982), Obra reciente at the Galería Arte Actual Mexicano in Monterrery (1984), Confrontación 86 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1986), and at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey (1997) .
Felguérez’s works are still shown actively, and murals are still created by the artist. In 2009 was the exhibition Manuel Felguérez, Invención Constructiva at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City which was inaugurated by President Felipe Calderón . For the Bicentennial of Mexico’s Independence, Felguérez’s mural “Ecuación en Acero” (Equation in Steel) was inaugurated by the same president at the Secretariat of Public Education . In 2011, 'Manuel Felguérez: Gráfica y Escultura' exhibited at the Centro Nacional de las Artes (Cenart) .
To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Mexico-China relations in 2012, the Mexican government sponsored the exhibition “Manuel Felguérez: Obre reciente” in Beijing, China. In the same year, Estética de lo real: Caos y orden de la obra de Manuel Felguérez" was presented at the Museo de Aguascalientes . There is also a hotel/museum/boutique called The Sebastian in Vail, which features original works by Felguérez. The enterprise’s house wine label features a design by the artist.
At over eighty years of age, he still spends eight hours a day experimenting and working on his art as well as traveling for exhibitions. He has used computers to program designs, experimenting with it as a new medium.
Artistry.
The formation of Felguérez’s style and imagery is closely tied to the various movements of Europe such as incorporate geometric-constructivist, informalism and abstract expressionism which he was exposed to in his early training. He has melded these elements into his own style. He work often contains basic geometric figures such as circles, triangles, rectangles and squares, in combinations to form his own “language.” His work has been compared to Picasso and Rufino Tamayo by art experts such as Teresa del Conde . He claims many influences but does not follow any one specifically. He regularly visits art museums to look for inspiration.
His creations never reference death because to him art is life. He does not believe that art is necessarily for catharsis and his emotions are not reflected in his work. His focus is on aesthetics, painting more with the head then the hands. Felguérez describes himself as a “producer and seller of aesthetic pleasure.”
He characterizes his was as one of constant experimentation, as he believe constant evolution distinguishes the artist from the artisan, who repeats styles and forms. He is against the “Neo-nationalism” movement in Mexican art as he does not like “neo” anything, since it means repeating something that has been done before. However, changes in his work are gradual, rather than leaps from one style to another. His more recent work has shown influence from modern computing as theme and in the use of computers as artistic tools. His emphasis on the new as well as his very negative experience with establishment artists of the 1940s have caused him to state emphatically that he does not want to create another school of art in Mexico.
Recognition.
In addition, he received an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana .
Manuel Felguérez Abstract Art Museum.
The Manuel Felguérez Abstract Art Museum was opened in 1998 in the city of Zacatecas. It is housed in a 19th century Neoclassical building which used to be a seminary and later a jail. The permanent collection contains about 100 works by the artists that represent his development over his long career as well as over 110 pieces by Mexican and international abstract artists. The initial donation was from Felguérez’s own private collection and given to the museum on the condition that it would be dedicated to the abstract art of his generation and those after.

Regenerative shock absorber

A regenerative shock absorber is a type of shock absorber that converts parasitic intermittent linear motion and vibration into useful energy, such as electricity. Conventional shock absorbers simply dissipate this energy as heat.
When used in an electric vehicle or hybrid electric vehicle the electricity generated by the shock absorber can be diverted to its powertrain to increase battery life. In non-electric vehicles the electricity can be used to power accessories such as air conditioning. Several different systems have been developed recently, though they are still in stages of development and not installed on production vehicles.
Electromagnetic.
A patent for such a device was filed in 2005. This type of system uses a linear motor/generator consisting of a stack of permanent magnets and coils to generate electricity. This system was further developed at Tufts University and has been licensed to Electric Truck, LLC. Preliminary data suggests 20% to 70% of the energy normally lost in the suspension can be recaptured with this system.
Hydraulic.
A system developed at MIT uses hydraulic pistons to force fluid through a turbine coupled to a generator. The system is controlled by active electronics which optimize damping, which the inventors claim also results in a smoother ride compared to a conventional suspension. They calculate that a large company like Walmart could save $13 million annually by converting their trucks.
Another system has been developed by a team at New York State University.

Meteorological history of Hurricane Gordon (1994)

The meteorological history of Hurricane Gordon consisted of a thirteen-day period in which the storm's path was erratic, persistent, and highly unusual. The hurricane formed near Panama in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 9, 1994. As a tropical depression it brushed Nicaragua and spent several days in the waters off the country's coast. Strengthening slightly into a tropical storm, Gordon wound its way north into the Greater Antilles. Despite warm waters, persistent wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest, Gordon made two more landfalls, on eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba, while delivering tremendous rains to western Hispaniola.
As Tropical Storm Gordon made its fourth landfall crossing the Florida Keys, it interacted with a cyclone in the upper-troposphere and a series of cyclonic lows which lent the storm some sub-tropical characteristics. After a few days as an unusual hybrid of a tropical and a subtropical system in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm re-claimed its fully tropical form and made yet another landfall, this time across the Florida peninsula, and continued into the Atlantic Ocean. In the Atlantic, Gordon rapidly strengthened to a Category 1 Hurricane. Gordon's characteristic wandering briefly brought it near North Carolina, but ultimately the storm headed south, weakening into a minor tropical storm before making its sixth and final landfall on Florida's east coast.
Hurricane Gordon was the seventh named storm and third hurricane of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. Although it never made landfall as a hurricane, in its meandering course the storm included six separate landfalls: four as a tropical storm and two as a tropical depression. Three of its landfalls were in the U.S. state of Florida.
Formation.
During the first week of November a large area of disturbed weather accumulated just north of Panama over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. A tropical wave passed through the area and gave it mild convection. A second wave passed through the area on November 6 and introduced cyclonic circulation to the disturbance. Over the next two days the system gradually organized and sparked a deep convection off Nicaragua's southeast coast. This organization, with initial maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 km/h), was designated Tropical Depression Twelve. Moving northwest, the storm began to slowly strengthen and its upper level outflow became favorable to further development. Spots of convection flared on the morning of November 9; banding features appeared as its center made landfall on the northeastern Nicaraguan coast near Puerto Cabezas. A full day later a trough to the storm's northwest over the Gulf of Mexico moved the depression offshore, to the northeast, and over the warm waters of the western Caribbean Sea. Fueled by these warm waters, on the night of November 9 it strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon with 40 mph (65 km/h) winds.
Lacking firm movement because of weak steering currents, Gordon meandered north-northeast in the presence of mild west-southwesterly wind shear, unable to strengthen under the adverse conditions. By November 11, a trough prodded Gordon to the north-northeast at 8 mph (13 km/h), and it strengthened by 6 mph (9 km/h) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea. The trough continued steering Gordon, bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12. Despite the warm waters, Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper-tropospheric shear hindered development, disorganized the upper level circulation, and reduced its winds to 40 mph (65 km/h).
Through the Greater Antilles.
November 13 was an active day for Tropical Storm Gordon. The trough over southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico continued to push Gordon eastward towards Jamaica. In the pre-dawn hours the storm clipped the eastern edge of the island, leaving 7.44 in (18.9 cm) of rainfall. Southwesterly wind shear kept the storm from developing beyond 45 mph (75 km/h), but neither the shear nor the landfall significantly disrupted the cyclone's organization. Accelerating, Gordon turned towards the northeast. Continued shear prevented the upper-level development needed for typical cyclonic organization, but a strong lower level circulation had formed. Its sustained winds were still only 40 mph (65 km/h), but as the system approached eastern Cuba a gust of 120 mph (192 km/h) was reported. The center crossed near Guantánamo Bay and the storm dumped heavy rainfall as it passed over the eastern portion of the island; even heavier rain fell in Haiti to the west, where 22.94 in (58.27 cm) of rain was recorded at Camp-Perrin.
Meanwhile, the broad-scale circulation that was covering most of the Caribbean Sea (of which Tropical Storm Gordon was only a part) was interacting with an upper-tropospheric trough near the Straits of Florida. This trough strengthened the broad upper-level cyclone, which in turn strengthened Gordon and spawned several other low-level circulations in the western Caribbean Sea. When Gordon crossed eastern Cuba, the National Hurricane Center determined that it had become the most dominant of these low level systems and had absorbed their convections. (Meteorologist Jose Fernandez-Partagas voiced the minority opinion that Gordon's circulatory center had dissipated over Cuba and that a low pressure system near the Bahamas was now the dominant system, which would have meant the demise of Tropical Storm Gordon and the emergence of a new tropical storm. While possible, this view was not accepted by the official hurricane summaries.) By nightfall of November 13, Gordon had not only made two landfalls and survived interactions with three competing systems but also, in assimilating the Bahamian low, had gained the cool central core typical of a subtropical cyclone.
The deep-layered cyclone within which Gordon was embedded steered the storm west-northwest, south of Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas, on November 14. A large ridge of high pressure near the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast increased the pressure gradient around the storm, so although its sub-tropical elements (namely a lack of deep convection) precluded a core of strong winds immediately around the storm's nucleus, strong winds were supported outside the storm's circulatory center. These winds inched up to 50 mph (85 km/h), but did not strengthen any further. The ridge continued to steer the hybrid Tropical/Subtropical Storm Gordon west-northwestward past the western Bahamas. This brought the southern portion of the storm's circulation over northern Cuba, while the strengthening northern circulation produced 60 mph (90 km/h) winds near Palm Beach. The storm's fourth landfall occurred on November 15 when Gordon passed over the Florida Keys near Key West, Florida. The storm then continued west over the lower Keys and into the Straights of Florida, where the storm's center began to warm and deep convection signaled the return of Gordon's purely tropical characteristics.
Second Florida landfall and peak strength.
Steering currents remained weak giving the storm a chance to fully re-develop its deep convection while immobile at sea. During this time, Tropical Storm Gordon began to spawn tornadoes. As the storm center was well offshore most were probably unreported, but six tornadoes touched down on the Florida coast. Four of the tornadoes were rated F0 on the Fujita scale, two were rated F1, and one was given an F2 rating with estimated wind speeds of 113–157 mph (181–253 km/h).
After stalling offshore for almost a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. Myers and Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, back over the open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear was pulling at the core of the deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.
Third Florida landfall and demise.
The shortwave trough that had been steering Gordon across Florida moved ahead of the storm and its influence was replaced by a mid-tropospheric ridge over the eastern United States. Under the influence of this new ridge the storm, which had been speeding northeast at 25 mph (40 km/h), turned to the north late on November 17. The hurricane's loop continued, and as it moved to a west-northwesterly heading Gordon briefly threatened North Carolina's Outer Banks before stalling offshore once again. In the presence of weak steering currents once again, Gordon lost strength and slipped back to tropical storm status with 70 mph (110 km/h) winds. On November 18, about 90 mi (150 km) off the Outer Banks, Gordon began a southward drift away from the North Carolina coast. In its brush with the Mid-Atlantic States, Gordon dropped 2–5 in (5–13 cm) with a maximum of 5.25 in (13.3 cm) recorded at Norfolk, Virginia. Warm waters improved its organization, but this did not result in stronger winds and the storm continued to weaken. Strong upper-level winds battered the storm from the northwest. They sheared away Gordon's upper-level convection while polluting the storm with colder and dryer air that weakened its lower level convection.
A high pressure system over the central United States drifted east and added a westward component to Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The high pressure system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of rain on Florida, with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina.
Track and forecasting.
Gordon's track was likened to Hurricane Dawn in 1972. The National Hurricane Center described the storm as "a complex system, followed an unusual, erratic path over the western Caribbean Sea and islands, Florida and the southwestern Atlantic." Due to the path, the agency had difficulties in forecasting Gordon, and the forecast errors were 10% to 30% above the average of the previous decade.

First surface mirror

A first surface mirror or front surface mirror (also commonly abbreviated FS mirror or FSM) is a mirror with the reflective surface being above a backing, as opposed to the conventional, second surface mirror with the reflective surface behind a transparent substrate such as glass or acrylic. In cases where the mirror is subjected to extreme cold (as low as 33 K as in the James Webb Space Telescope), a polished pure beryllium mirror is used without a first surface coating in order to obviate buckling caused by differing coefficients of thermal expansion.
They are made for applications requiring a strict reflection without a "ghosting" effect as seen with a second surface mirror, where a faint secondary reflection could be observed, coming from the front surface of the glass. This includes most optics applications where light is being manipulated in a specific manner. Telescopes, rear-projection televisions, periscopes, non-reversing mirrors, high quality kaleidoscopes, and the animation process Spectrafocus use this type of mirror.
Silvering.
The "silvering" on a front surface mirror is usually aluminium for visible light and gold for infrared radiation.

Tautua Samoa Party

Tautua Samoa is a political party in Samoa. The party's policies include economic development, particularly in the agricultural sector, public service reform, a limit on the number of Associate Ministers, and a reduction in the term of Parliament from 5 to 3 or 4 years. Its leader is Leatinu’u Salote Lesa.
Formation.
The party was formed by 11 independent Members of Parliament in December 2008. The party's founders described their aim as providing parliamentary opposition to the ruling Human Rights Protection Party.
Under the Samoan Electoral Act, registering as members of a new party would have required Tautua Samoa's members to contest a by-election for their parliamentary seats. To avoid this, the party was initially registered under the Companies Act, and its members remained listed as independents.
The party launched with no formal leader; its interim chair was Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi. In January 2009, the Speaker of Parliament ordered Tautua Samoa to provide formal notice of its existence and membership. The party formally identified itself, and nine Members of Parliament identified themselves as members. In May, Speaker Tolofuaivalelei Falemoe Lei'ataua revoked the parliamentary membership of all nine of the party's MPs, on the grounds that joining a part "after" being elected "breached the provisions of the "Electoral Act" and the parliament standing orders". Their expulsion from Parliament would prompt by-elections. Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi stated that he would seek an interim injunction against the Speaker's ruling. The Supreme Court of Samoa cancelled the by-elections and reinstated the MPs, stating that the speaker's position was wrong and the party formation was legal.
In March 2010, the "Electoral Act" was amended, forbidding any Member of Parliament from leaving his initial party while retaining his seat. Consequently, three members of the Tautua Samoa Party resigned from Parliament: party chairman Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi, and former HRPP cabinet ministers Palusalue Fa’apo II and Va'ai Papu Vailupe. Their resignation will lead to by-elections in their constituencies: Vaisigano number one, Faleata west, and Safata territorial. Only those three Members of Parliament resigned, because only they declared they were members of the party following its formal registration. Other MPs who had initially aligned themselves with the party are therefore not officially members.
On 2 May 2010 Va'ai Papu Vailupe was elected unopposed in the Vaisigano by-election, becoming the first MP elected for the party.
2011 election.
In September 2010 the party announced that it had made an agreement with the Samoa Party and is negotiating with the People's Party for the latter to run their candidates under the Tautua banner. Shortly thereafter, the leader of the Samoa Party, Feo Nemaia Esau, announced that his party had disbanded and merged into the Tautua Samoa Party. He explained that the merger would form a more "united opposition" to the ruling Human Rights Protection Party. 
Also in September 2010, founding member Mulipola Oliva asked to run as an HRPP candidate.
In November, the party announced that it had reached an agreement with the United Samoa People's Party and several independent politicians to form an organisation, Tumua'i Tutusa, to campaign together for the election. The new group's chairman, Afualo Dr. Wood Salele, stated that the organisation would seek divine intervention, notably through a week of fasting and praying, to defeat the Human Rights Protection Party in the upcoming election. In December, party president Papalii Tavita Moala resigned unexpectedly, and Afualo Dr. Woods Salele was chosen for the presidency in his place.
In February 2011 at least three Tautua candidates were prevented from standing after village mayors refused to sign their nomination forms.
Tautua Samoa Party President Va'aelua Eti Alesana, who was elected in February 2011, died on 4 October 2011. On 11 November, Leatinu’u Salote Lesa became the party's president - the first woman to lead a political party in Samoa.

Ensisheim (meteorite)

The Ensisheim meteorite is a stony meteorite observed to fall on November 7, 1492 in a wheat field outside of the walled town of Ensisheim in then Alsace, Further Austria (now France).
Features.
The meteorite is an LL6 ordinary chondrite, weighing 127 kilograms; it was described as triangular in shape, and it created a 1 meter deep hole upon impact.
Contemporary response.
The fall of the meteorite through the Earth's atmosphere was observed as a fireball for a distance of up to 150 kilometres from where it eventually landed. 
Sebastian Brant (1458–1521), satirist and author of "Das Narrenschiff" described the meteorite and its fall in the poem, ""Loose Leaves Concerning the Fall of the Meteorite"".
Residents of the walled town and nearby farms and villages gathered at the location to raise the meteorite from its impact hole and began removing pieces of the meteorite. 
A local magistrate interfered with the destruction of the stone, in order to preserve the object for King Maximilian, the son of reigning Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick III. A piece of the meteorite was sent to Cardinal Piccolomini (later Pope Pius III) at the Vatican along with a number of related verses written by Brant.
Brant created broadsheets in Latin and German with a poem about the meteorite describing it as an omen. The fall is also described in Folio 257 of the "Nuremberg Chronicle". German painter and mathematician Albrecht Dürer sketched his observations of the fall of the meteorite.

Robert Gorges

Robert Gorges (1595 – late 1620s) was a captain in the English navy and briefly Governor-General of New England from 1623 to 1624. He was the son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. After serving in the Venetian wars, Gorges was given a commission as Governor-General of New England and emigrated to modern Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1623, building his settlement on the site of the failed Wessagusset Colony. 
At the time of the founding of Gorges' settlement, the English explorer Capt. Francis West was named admiral of the Plymouth Council for New England to advise him, along with another English explorer and naval Captain, Christopher Levett, who was attempting a settlement at Portland, Maine, which also later failed. Levett was named to advise Gorges as the governor of the Plymouth Colony. 
The arrangement was not satisfactory. Apparently frustrated by the pace of settlement and an obdurate attitude of the new colonists towards English interference, Capt. Gorges returned to England in the spring of 1624. Several of his settlers turned up later at the house Levett had built on what is today House Island in Casco Bay, Maine. Gorges died sometime in the 1620s; his brother John had taken over the Gorges claims by 1629.

No Mercy (2008)

No Mercy (2008) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on October 5, 2008 at the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon. It was the 11th and final annual No Mercy event and starred wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown and ECW brands. It is one of only two WWE pay-per-view events to be held in the state of Oregon, the other being Unforgiven 2004.
Eight professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The first featured wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which defending World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho defeated Shawn Michaels in a ladder match. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand, in which defending WWE Champion Triple H defeated challenger Jeff Hardy in a standard wrestling match. Three featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In a standard wrestling match between wrestlers from the Raw brand, Batista defeated John "Bradshaw" Layfield to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. The second was a standard match between wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand in which the Big Show defeated The Undertaker. The third was the predominant match from the ECW brand, a standard match for the ECW Championship, in which the champion Matt Hardy defeated Mark Henry.
No Mercy (2008) had an approximate attendance of 9,527. When the event was released on DVD, it reached a peak position of second on "Billboard"'s Recreational Sports DVD Sales Chart. The event received 261,000 pay-per-view buys, less than the previous year's event.
Background.
The event featured eight professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's three brands - SmackDown, Raw, or ECW - the three storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees.
Wrestlers from the Raw brand were featured in the main event at No Mercy: a ladder match for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which the title belt was suspended above the ring and the first man to climb the ladder and retrieve the belt would win. The match was contested between World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels. The build up to the match began at Unforgiven, when Jericho replaced then World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk in a Championship Scramble match, a 20-minute time limit bout, during which participants can become the temporary champion via pinfall or submission. Punk had, earlier in the night, been attacked by Randy Orton, in storyline, and could not compete, leading to Jericho being his replacement and winning the World Heavyweight Championship. On the September 15 episode of Raw, it was announced that Shawn Michaels would wrestle Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship at No Mercy in a ladder match.
The leading staged rivalry scripted into the pay-per-view on the SmackDown brand was between Triple H and Jeff Hardy over the WWE Championship. It was announced on the September 12, 2008 episode of "SmackDown" that there would be a Fatal-Four Way match, a standard wrestling match involving four competitors. The winner of the match would challenge Triple H for the WWE Championship at No Mercy. The Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, Montel Vontavious Porter, and Jeff Hardy were the four participants in the match, which Hardy won.
It was also announced that Batista would face John "Bradshaw" Layfield in a standard wrestling match, dubbed in professional wrestling as a singles match, to determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship.
During the September 17, 2008 episode of "ECW", it was announced that Matt Hardy would defend the ECW Championship against Mark Henry.
It was announced on the September 22, 2008 episode of "Raw" that Kane would receive a singles match against Rey Mysterio. On the following week on an episode of "Raw", an extra stipulation was added, in which if Kane won at "No Mercy", Mysterio would be forced to unmask after the match.
It was also announced that The Big Show and The Undertaker would have a match, following the events that occurred at Unforgiven.
Event.
Preliminary Matches.
The first match was a dark match, between The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) and John Morrison and The Miz, which The Colóns won.
The first televised match was for the ECW Championship, featuring the champion Matt Hardy versus Mark Henry, who was accompanied by his manager Tony Atlas. During the start of the match Henry overpowered Matt Hardy with attacks. One point of the match involved Hardy taking down Henry with a running chop block. Hardy then focused on attacking Henry's knee. Another point was Hardy trying to lock in a Figure-Four Leglock only to be pushed face first onto the second turnbuckle. Since then Henry gained control over Hardy again. During the match Henry was able to lock in the Bearhug but Hardy countered into a sunset flip only for Henry to attempt a Banzai Drop but Hardy moving out of the way. Hardy was able to hit the Side Effect and went for the Twist of Fate only to be dropped chest first onto the mat. The end of the match involved Henry going for the World's Strongest Slam only to have Hardy counter it with a Twist of Fate.
The next match was Beth Phoenix versus Candice Michelle for the WWE Women's Championship which Phoenix came with to the match. The match started out with Candice taking Phoenix down with various type of kicks. Phoenix then gained control of the match by slamming Candice back first onto the corner. Phoenix then focused on Candice's shoulder with a running kick and slamming it onto the turnbuckle. Phoenix continued to focus on Candice's shoulder by locking in an armbar on her. After being in the armbar for a long time Candice was able to counter into a pin only to have Phoenix kick out. Candice then again got the upper hand on The Glamazon, Beth Phoenix with a jawbreaker. Candice was able to hit a high impact spinning wheel kick and again go for the pin but Phoenix kicked out again. Phoenix was able to gain advantage by dropping Candice face first onto the mat only to quickly have Candice knock her down from the top rope. A spot in the match was Santino Marella pulling Phoenix out of the ring while Candice went for the pin only to have Candice baseball slide "Glamarella". However that distraction allowed Phoenix to take Candice. The end of the match involved Candice go for the Candywrapper only to have Phoenix counter it into a "Glam Slam" and pin Candice Michelle for the win.
The next match of the night was Rey Mysterio versus Kane with the stipulation that if Mysterio loses he will have to unmask. The start of the match had Mysterio springboard dropkick Kane out of the ring. Also during the start of the match Mysterio went for a running attack only to be big booted by Kane. Kane tried to rip Mysterio's mask off only for Mysterio to roll out of the ring.

Timm Thaler (1979 TV series)

Timm Thaler (also known as The Legend of Tim Tyler: The Boy Who Lost His Laugh) is a 1979 children's television miniseries based on the 1962 children's novel by German writer James Krüss. The series originally aired in Germany as the first Christmas series on German national broadcaster ZDF. In 1988, the series was acquired for transmission in the United Kingdom by the BBC. The English version was produced by Angela Beeching, with script by Nel Romano, and retitled "The Legend of Tim Tyler". It aired during Children's BBC in the weekday afternoons. The screenplay was written by Justus Pfaue and Peter M. Thouet and differs somewhat from the original novel. Directed by Sigi Rothemund, the series became a hit in Germany and made then 14-year-old Tommi Ohrner, in the lead role of Timm Thaler (Tim Tyler), a popular teen idol of the era. The role of the Baron was played by Horst Frank.
Plot summary.
Thirteen year old Timm Thaler (aka: Tim Tyler) has an irresistible laugh and is thus very popular. The mysterious Baron (in the novel his last name Lefuet is a German ananym for devil, like "lived" is in English), a grumpy and very wealthy businessman always wearing a black carnation in his buttonhole, tries unsuccessfully to buy Timm's laugh. Timm's father is a flight instructor and dies during a flight for the Baron. It is indicated that this is caused by the Baron. Timm, after having lost his beloved father, is vulnerable to the Baron.
To financially support his stepmother, Timm no longer resists the Baron and swaps his laugh for the ability to win any bet he makes, no matter how absurd it is. If one of them tells about this pact, he loses his rights from the contract. The Baron and his servant Anatol use this new gift for business success. Timm however grows increasingly unhappy. He decides to get his laugh back. He tries several tricks only to realize that it takes a bet to get his laugh back.
Differences from the novel.
The most prominent story change is the odyssey of Timm, which in the novel takes four years but was reduced to several weeks in the screenplay so that a single actor could play the role of Timm. The screenplay also differed in that one of the themes in the novel, the criticism of social moirés and capitalism is no longer a prominent element of the story. By portraying several of the protagonists as Catholic clerics, the narrative was instead imbued with a pseudo-religious tint.
Timm's bullying stepbrother is missing in the series, and his stepmother is depicted in a positive way, which is a stark contrast to her character in the novel. In the book, Timm's father is not a sports airplane pilot, thus, Timm originally meets the Baron, not at a family celebration at the local airport, but at the racetrack, a place he associates with his father who died in a building site accident when Timm was four.
The demonic but polite and urbane Signor Grandizzi from Genoa was replaced in the series by the dark servant Anatol. Several other characters are also changed or "exchanged" in the series, including the nun, Sister Agathe instead of Kreschimir and the ship's cook, Heinrich instead of the helmsman, Jonny. Also, Several new characters were introduced both on the protagonist's and the antagonist's sides.
Locations.
One of the central filming locations was the Mirador del Río as well as the artificial pool of the Jameos del Agua in Lanzarote, both designed by Cesar Manrique. These were used as the setting for the Baron's futuristic mountain lair. Additional locations were the Restaurant "La Era" in Yaiza, Arrecife and the national park Timanfaya.
The city scenes were shot in Hamburg, e. g. at the Landungsbrücken and the airport in Hartenholm, 50 km north of Hamburg. The final parts were shot in the Radisson-SAS-Hotel at the Congress-Centrum Hamburg (CCH). The final scene, where Tim gets his laugh back, was shot in front of the district court Hamburg and today's Brahmsplatz (Karl-Muck-Platz then).

<doc id="18435504" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18435504" title="Virtual pharmacy">
Virtual pharmacy

A virtual pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a presence in the virtual world or Internet (World Wide Web). They vary from simply an expansion of land based pharmacies like CVS Pharmacy or Walgreens in the United States who needed to add the capability to serve patients from the comfort of their home, to completely virtual examples that refer patient’s prescriptions to various land based pharmacies throughout the globe, this process is similar to drop shipping. The consumer basically finds their favorite virtual pharmacy through search engines like Google or Yahoo, explains their symptoms, look at the recommended drugs and fills out an online questionnaire that is forwarded to doctor for approval. If the doctor approves the patient’s request he writes a prescription and forwards it to nearby pharmacy who then ships it the patient, sometimes in as little as 18 hours. Virtual pharmacies are booming businesses online today.
Process.
Often virtual pharmacies will employ several certified pharmacists and physicians who review your request, then fills your prescription, and dispense the drugs, usually within a day or so. These services are provided from a remote site, while using technology, in this the order is accessed by the web browser and filled by the pharmacist. After they have filled the prescription, the medications are shipped overnight via FedEx; these also help in providing online care without a visit to the doctor.
Advantages and benefits.
A wide selection of drugs, free medical consultation, free and speedy shipping, and unbelievably low prices, really low prices for online drugs, no online consulting fees, are a few of the benefits to be derived from a virtual pharmacy. All you have to do is go online, find the site, browse the different medications available, prices and categories of the drugs online, without restrictions, or a prior prescription. You just click on your symptoms, and a variety of drugs instantly appear with the description and prices, all you have to do is choose the one you want click on it and select “buy”. In doing this you eliminate the prescription fee, the long waits in line, visit to the doctor, and doctors’ fees.
Disadvantages and dangers.
But on the negative side, virtual pharmacies sometimes import counterfeit drugs into the US drug supply; these importations may also damage drug safety on an international level. They also import cheap foreign replicas of many U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs; this can pose a serious health risk to consumers. The dispensation of drugs from a pharmacist to a person they don’t know or have not seen, can prove to be very dangerous. Many of these imported drugs are also expired or contaminated and stored under unsafe or inappropriate conditions. The drugs which are dispensed without a prescription by a doctor eliminates the possibility of being checked by a licensed professional, and treated accordingly, resulting in patients not receiving appropriate medications, and not being aware of the dangers associated with improper administration. Another drawback to using an online pharmacy is, that you get what you buy, there is no way for you to return it, as there is no forwarding address
FDA opinion.
The FDA conducted a survey in early 2000, and found out that there are almost 300 or 400 internet sites which are marketing prescription drugs to end users, half of these are domestic, and the other half with locations outside the US. They have taken the position that the end users are at risk if they purchase prescription drugs from virtual pharmacies, which are not licensed within the state pharmacy law. The FDA has also banned the importation of unapproved, adulterated and misbranded drugs from the US, and is unable to monitor the huge volumes of importations into the country on a daily basis. They are unable to take action against these virtual pharmacies, as they are not aware of the physical location of the pharmacies.
Legality.
Virtual pharmacies are not registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) but, when the laws are followed, each and every pharmacist or doctor that writes or fills a prescription through a referral from a virtual pharmacy IS personally licensed. Often the foreign based pharmacies, specifically out of Mexico and India have no legal basis and are violating numerous federal laws and are at risk of being convicted for drug trafficking. On the flip side, the prescribing and filling of non-controlled drugs in the US is still legal, most of the pharmacies are registered with the DEA and a licensed US doctor looks over the medical questionnaire and determine whether or not patients can get their prescriptions filled.
Controlled (Scheduled) Drugs - are classified as medications which are often misused, e.g., Morphine, Xanax, and Codeine as well as other sedatives and stimulants ranging from widely illegal drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine to diet pills like generic Phentermine or Adipex-P. It is illegal to purchase any DEA scheduled drugs without a prescription some even to process them period. There are thousands of controlled drugs which are all registered by the DEA. The severity of the control lever ranges for I to VIII, i.e., I and II being completely illegal to process even with a prescription, III to VIII only requiring a prescription written by a doctor whom the patient has a local relationship with.
Non-controlled drugs.
Over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as aspirin and mild analgesics used in the temporary relief of pains. There are also a number of drugs that DO require a prescription but not a personal doctor patient relationship or recent physical within the past year. <br>These include but are not limited to: <br>1. Tramadol(Generic Ultram)<br> 2. Viagra<br> 3. Fioricet (Butalbital)<br> 4. Soma (Carisprodal)<br> 5. Valtrex <br> 6. Ortho Tri-Cyclen<br>.
Timeline.
Past and present.
Currently, the FDA and DEA are trying to cut down on the amount of unregulated shipment of drugs to the US. And as soon as they are able to get that under control, the future of the many virtual pharmacies popping up all over the internet will be addressed. Many of the popular land based pharmacies and drug store chains like CVS, Walgreens, Target, Wal-Mart, Rite Aid etc. began jumping in head first to create a presence in the virtual world. CVS being the first to open and operate a virtual pharmacy in 1999 with Soma.com. Soon after, Drugstore.com released their own site and went public on Feb. 27th, 1999, they immediately claimed to be the world largest Pharmacy/Drugstore because they were able to offer so many products and prescriptions virtually at consumers fingertips without the cost of storing them at individual retail locations. And many of these pharmacies have made part of their web page mail-order pharmaceutical processing centers and e-pharmacies.
Future.
There is currently no law which states that it can be licensed or regulated, and until this is done, they will remain anonymous online suppliers of drugs. However that does not stop them from being a sought-after alternative to a doctor’s visit, prescriptions and hassles in getting the drug you require.
Quantity.
An FDA report in early 2000 suggested there are approx 300-400 virtual pharmacies in operation. A similar report revealed there are now over 2000 in existence today and are continuing to grow rapidly.

Black Roses (The Rasmus album)

Black Roses is the seventh studio album by the Finnish rock band The Rasmus, which was released on 29 September 2008 in the UK. In Germany the album was released on 26 September and in the Nordic countries two days before. The album immediately replaced Metallica's "Death Magnetic" on the top spot of the Finnish Album Charts and went gold after one week. Estimated of 350,000 copies of albums sold worldwide as of late 2009.
Background information.
According to Dynasty Recordings' MySpace profile, the band rested in Helsinki during the winter 2006 and also wrote songs for the upcoming album. They had met the producer Desmond Child at a concert in Dominican Republic 3 November. Guitarist Pauli Rantasalmi told The Rasmus had written around 30 songs, 11 of which were chosen for the album. The band started recording the new album in Dynasty Studios, Helsinki, Finland 17 September 2007 for a month and in the end of the year went to Nashville to go on. Smaller parts were recorded in Stockholm, Singapore, Berlin and Greece too. While Desmond Child was the main producer, he was helped by Harry Sommerdahl. Michael Wagener was the mixer for "Black Roses" except "Livin' in a World Without You", which was mixed by Niclas Flyckt. The album was originally planned to be released in March, but was delayed due to new songs the band still wanted to record, including "Livin' in a World Without You". The album's sound is generally less heavy than that of "Hide from the Sun". However, a few of the album's songs, such as "Ten Black Roses", "The Fight", and "Lost and Lonely", contain symphonic rock/metal elements.
Singles.
The first single "Livin' in a World Without You" was released on 10 September and for radio stations in July. The music video for "Livin' in a World Without You" was shot on 3 July in Stockholm, and released in August. The song was first played live on 5 July in NRJ in the Park in Berlin together with another new song, "Ten Black Roses".
The second single will be "Justify", released later in autumn. It is quite low, dark and emotional song with some Depeche Mode influences. The Depeche Mode influence is only weak to this song especially, and can be attributed more generally to the music of The Rasmus. But parts of the melody line is an echo of The Cure hit song "Lullaby". This shows particularly in the first and last 30 seconds of the song.
Lauri Ylönen stated on the Austrian television station Go TV, that the duet with Anette Olzon (Nightwish) was to be released later in 2009. The title of song is "October & April". It was released in November, 2009.
Touring.
The first time The Rasmus played any new songs from "Black Roses" was the gig in Berlin on 5 July.
The group started the promotion for "Black Roses" with acoustic gigs at Radio SAW and RS2 in Germany 26–27 August. The "Black Roses" world tour started in January 2009 in Europe. In Finland they did a tour called "Dynasty Tour 2008" in October 2008 together with Von Hertzen Brothers and Mariko starting from Seinäjoki and finishing in Helsinki. The "Black Roses" tour so far contained concerts in more than twenty-four countries, while some concerts in South America had to be cancelled because of the outbreak of the severe swine flu.
Between June 14 and June 28, 2009 The Rasmus played together with Alice Cooper and Scorpions on a short stadium tour in Russia called "Monsters of Rock". In the summer months of 2009 the band played several festivals.

Marion County Courthouse (Ohio)

The Marion County Courthouse is the seat of government for Marion County, Ohio, United States. Located at the heart of the city of Marion, it is a sister of the courthouses that stand in Washington Court House in Fayette County, Ohio, and Charlotte, Eaton County, Michigan. All three were designed by architect David W. Gibbs,; however, the Fayette County Courthouse was built from 1882–1885, the Eaton County Michigan courthouse was also built from 1882-1885 and uses brick and stone for its exterior rather than stone for the Ohio built structures. The Marion County Courthouse was built during 1884-1886. The blueprints are a modification from even older designs for the Henry and Union County Courthouses.
Ten portholes are decorated with sandstone heads of various figures. Four of them are meant to depict various races — a white woman, an African man, an Asian man, and an American Indian man. Other heads include two settler girls and a settler woman, plus a head similar to depictions of William Shakespeare.
In the 1970s, county officials announced a plan to perform extensive changes the building's interior, which had previously experienced few modifications since construction. The Marion County Historical Society protested the plans and aroused substantial public displeasure; plans were laid for a referendum to repeal the plans, and enough local residents signed a ballot petition that it would have qualified for a vote, but no vote was held because Ohio law does not permit referenda of the sort. Numerous original wood carvings and paintings were destroyed, ceilings were dropped, and aluminum doors installed. County officials sought to mollify local ire by retaining the building's exterior, including restoring the statue of Justice atop the tower.

Megaloblast

A megaloblast is an unusually large erythroblast that can be associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency (as caused by pernicious anemia or dietary insufficiency) and/or folic acid deficiency (collectively called megaloblastic anemia). It is differentiated from a normoblast, which is a normally-sized erythroblast. This kind of anemia leads to macrocytes (abnormally large red cells). The cause of this cellular gigantism is an impairment in DNA synthesis which delays nuclear maturation and cell division. Because RNA and cytoplasmic elements are synthesized at a constant rate despite the cells' impaired DNA synthesis, the cells show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony.

The Oakville Refinery (also known as Petro Canada Oakville Refinery) was a refinery located on the border of Oakville and Burlington in Ontario, Canada.
The refinery was commissioned in 1958 by Cities Service Company. It had an initial capacity . In 1963, the refinery was acquired by BP. Later it was acquired by Petro-Canada and supplied fuel in Ontario. It closed in 2005, with Petro-Canada (now Suncor Energy) getting supplies for the Ontario market from its Montreal Refinery.
The facility once employed 350 people and produced some . Petro-Canada ascribed the decision to new rules requiring lower sulphur content in gasoline, that would have required an expensive retrofit of the refinery. The relatively small and specialized refinery was also less efficient than the larger ones operated elsewhere. The equipment from the refinery was transported to Pakistan where it was re-erected. Suncor Energy (formerly Petro-Canada prior to merger in Aug 2009) still operates from the site as a storage terminal.
It was the third refinery to close along Lake Ontario; Shell's Oakville refinery was closed in 1983, and Esso's Mississauga, Ontario refinery located further east on Lakeshore Road closed in 1985.

The turbine has flexible blades manufactured by a resin transfer molding process, which which are designed to untwist as the turbine's rotational speed increases. While the LEAP is designed to operate at a higher pressure than the CFM-56 (which is partly why it is more efficient), GE plans to set the operating pressure lower than the maximum in order to maximize the engine's service life and reliability. Currently proposed for the LEAP is a greater use of composite materials, a blisk fan in the compressor, a second-generation Twin Annular Pre Swirl (TAPS II) combustor, and a bypass ratio around 10-11:1. These technological advances are projected to produce 16% lower fuel consumption.Reliability is also supported by use of an educator-based oil cooling system similar to that of the GenX, featuring coolers mounted on the inner lining of the fan duct. According to Aviation Week's article, "The educator device produces a venturi effect, which ensures a positive pressure to keep oil in the lower internal sump."
In total, 28 test engines will be used by CFM to achieve engine certification, and 32 others will be used by Airbus, Boeing and COMAC for aircraft certification and test programs. The first engine entering the test program successfully reached and sustained 33,000 lb. of thrust, required to satisfy the highest rating for the Airbus A321. The same engine ultimately reached 35,000 lb. of thrust in test runs.
Orders.
The LEAP engine has attracted more than 5,000 orders and GE plans to produce 1,700 engines by the end of 2018.
The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has chosen the LEAP engine to provide the engines for its new COMAC C919 aircraft.
The company expects to receive certification for the first LEAP, the LEAP-1C, for China's 150-seat COMAC C919 twinjet. The aircraft is due to enter service in 2016. The engine will also be deployed in the same year on the new Airbus A320neo variant.
On July 20, 2011, American Airlines announced that it planned to purchase 100 Boeing 737 aircraft featuring the LEAP-1B engine. The project was approved by Boeing on August 30, 2011 as the Boeing 737 MAX. Southwest Airlines is the launch customer of the 737 MAX with a firm order of 150 aircraft.

Creole Kosher Kitchen

Creole Kosher Kitchen was one of the only kosher restaurants in the city of New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina. The restaurant, which was located in the French Quarter, was forced to close following severe devastation from the hurricane to the owner's life in New Orleans that ultimately led to the relocation of his family to Los Angeles.
Creole Kosher Kitchen was started in 2000 by Gideon Daneshrad, also known as "Chef Gideon", a local businessman who had operated several area shops. Gideon's goal was to provide an escape from the non-kosher food that filled the tourist area of New Orleans. The food served replicated the style of traditional New Orleans food, minus non-kosher ingredients such as shrimp and crawfish. The location was a popular hangout for Jewish and non-Jewish travelers alike.
When Katrina struck, the Daneshrads, a well-known family in the New Orleans area, traveled to Los Angeles, where members of their family lived. Following the storm, they returned briefly to New Orleans to assess the damage to their property. Soon after, they permanently settled in Los Angeles, where Chef Gideon contemplated bringing his recipes to the area.
Following Katrina, the other kosher restaurants in the Greater New Orleans area reopened. Creole Kosher Kitchen, however, has remained closed. An Italian cafe currently operates out of its former location.

<doc id="18435700" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18435700" title="North Metro Technical College">
North Metro Technical College

North Metro Technical College (commonly North Metro Tech, or NMTC ) was a two-year state technical college located in the state of Georgia, and governed by the Technical College System of Georgia. The college was accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate degrees since 2006. Since the beginning of July 2009, it is now the North Metro campus of nearby Chattahoochee Technical College.
Location.
As suggested by its name, North Metro primarily served students from four suburban counties of north-northwestern metropolitan Atlanta: Cobb, Bartow, Cherokee, and Paulding, where together almost all of its student body resides. Forty percent live in Cobb, while over one quarter of the students live in Bartow.
The campus, now a campus of Chattahoochee Technical College is located in the southeast corner of Bartow County, however the street address is listed as Acworth, which is across the county line in Cobb. It is located west of I-75, with exits 278 (Glade Road) and 277 (Georgia 92) being the most convenient exits to the campus.
Enrollment.
The college operated on the quarter system, as opposed to the semester system. As a college, there were on average 2000 students enrolled during each quarter, with the summer quarter having the lowest level of attendance. During the fiscal year of 2008 (July 2007 to June 2008), the student population of NMTC increased by just over 10%, compared to an average increase of 3.6% for the entire Technical College System of Georgia. The college also experienced a large increase in its FTE (full-time equivalent) growth level, which is calculated by comparing the total number of students to the total number enrollment hours and producing a figure that would reflect a full-time student population of 100%. It is reported that the college is enrolling both an increasing number of younger students, many of whom are just out of high school, and a greater number of full-time students.
Programs.
List of general program areas offered by the college:
Sports.
It was announced in the summer of 2008 that North Metro Technical College would begin an intercollegiate sports program, which would be at the club level The teams would consist of men's basketball and women's volleyball. Teams from NMTC would be part of the Technical College System of Georgia Athletic Conference. The NMTC teams would compete against Northwestern Technical College, Coosa Valley Technical College, West Central Technical College, and Griffin Technical College. The mascot 'Blue Devils' was selected in part to honor the Summer Hill School, a defunct public school in nearby Cartersville, Georgia. It is unclear how the program will be affected by the merger.
Relationship with Georgia Highlands.
Until August 2008, Georgia Highlands College held classes and had offices on the NMTC campus. This collaboration involved the sharing of classrooms and spaces such as the college library. Georgia Highlands began to move its classes to Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta in the summer of 2008, citing space needs for both GHC and NMTC. The main campus of Georgia Highlands College is located in Rome, Georgia.
Consolidation.
It was officially announced on August 8, 2008 that approval had been given for the consolidation of North Metro Technical College with Chattahoochee Technical College. A primary reason given for the merger was the geographic proximity of the two institutions. The NMTC campus and the main Chattahoochee Campus are about 15 miles or 25 km apart. Chattahoochee also has three satellite campuses: in Dallas (Paulding campus), Mableton (South Cobb campus), and northeast Cobb (Mountain View campus). In October 2008, Appalachian Technical College was added to the merger, including its nearby satellite campus in Woodstock, and its much further main campus, located outside metro Atlanta in Jasper. Although the DTAE (now TCSG) system has normally named satellite campuses by the county they are in, NMTC is now the North Metro campus of Chattahoochee Technical College in honor of its previous service as a separate college. It was announced that Dr. Sanford Chandler would become the President of the new institution.

Sogozha River

Sogozha () is a river in Vologda and Yaroslavl Oblasts in Russia. It is 125 km long, with a drainage basin of 2,950 km².
The river terminates in the Rybinsk Reservoir of the Volga River. Before the construction of the Rybinsk Reservoir the Sogozha was a tributary of the Sheksna River.
The town of Poshekhonye is situated on the left (southern) bank of the Sogozha. Historically, the river received two left tributaries, the Soga (from the east) and the Pertomka (from the south) within the city limits. Due to the water level rise caused by the Rybinsk Reservoir, the Sogozha and the Soga now form a wide bay at their joint entering of the reservoir.

736 Naval Air Squadron

736 Naval Air Squadron (736 NAS) is a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy. It was most recently recommissioned at RNAS Culdrose on 6 June 2013 to fly the Hawk T1, following a restructuring of Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit.
History.
Formation and early years.
The squadron was first formed at RNAS Yeovilton on 24 May 1943 as an air combat training squadron for naval aviators, before moving to RNAS St Merryn in September that year. Between 1943 and 1952 the squadron operated several piston-engined aircraft including the Supermarine Seafire, Fairey Barracuda, Hawker Sea Fury and Fairey Firefly.
The jet age.
The squadron moved to RNAS Culdrose in 1950 where in August 1952, it was eventually disbanded as piston-engined squadron and reformed as the Advanced Jet Flying School; operating Supermarine Attacker and Meteor T.7 jet aircraft.
It was recommissioned at RNAS Lossiemouth in June 1953 as a training squadron for Sea Vampire and Hawker Sea Hawk. In 1959 the squadron was equipped with Supermarine Scimitar F.1 aircraft under the command of Lieutenant Commander J.D. Baker, to provide support for operational squadrons. As Scimitars started to be phased out of first line servicing, 736 Squadron was disbanded on 26 March 1965.
736 NAS reformed shortly afterwards with the Blackburn Buccaneer S.2, using aircraft and aircrews from the recently disbanded 700B Flight (the Buccaneer S.2 Intensive Flying Trials Unit) in order to train aircrews for the aircraft. Still based at RNAS Lossiemouth, from 1967 onwards the unit shared a pool of aircraft with 803 NAS, the Buccaneer HQ and weapons trials unit. With the decision to transfer all the RN's Buccaneers to the RAF, 736 NAS took on the extra task of training RAF crews. To cope with this, several Buccaneer S.1s were taken out of storage to increase the numbers of aircraft available, and a number of RAF aircrew who had previously served exchange tours with FAA Buccaneer squadrons were posted to 736 NAS as instructors. After a few accidents due to engine problems the S.1s were withdrawn from service in 1970. In 1971 the RAF stood up their own operational conversion unit (237 OCU) to take over the training of both their own and the dwindling number of RN aircrews.
736 NAS was finally disbanded in early 1972, and was inactive until it was recommissioned in order to operate the Fleet Air Arm's Hawk T1s in 2013.

List of tallest buildings in El Paso

This list of tallest buildings in El Paso ranks skyscrapers and high-rises in the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas by height. The tallest building in the city is the 21-story Wells Fargo Plaza, which rises and was completed in 1971. The second-tallest building in the city is the Chase Tower, which rises .
The history of skyscrapers in El Paso began with the completion in 1909 of the Caples Building, which is regarded as the first high-rise in the city; the structure rose and seven floors. The Anson Mills Building, which is considered to be the city's first skyscraper, was completed in 1911. This 12-floor, structure stood as the tallest in El Paso until 1930. The city went through a building boom in the early 1970s, during which El Paso saw the completion of most of the tallest buildings, including the Wells Fargo Plaza and Chase Tower. The city is going through another major building boom when the talk about revitazing downtown started. In this time period, many buildings are being renovated including the old International Hotel and the Anson Mills Building As of June 2008, there are 25 completed high-rises in the city. However, no El Paso buildings are among the tallest in the United States.
The most recently completed skyscraper in El Paso is El Paso County Courthouse, which rises and 13 floors.

Hip spica cast

A hip spica cast is a sort of orthopedic cast used to immobilize the hip or thigh. It is used to facilitate healing of injured hip joints or of fractured femurs.
A hip spica includes the trunk of the body and one or more legs. A hip spica which covers only one leg to the ankle or foot may be referred to as a single hip spica, while one which covers both legs is called a double hip spica. A one-and-a-half hip spica encases one leg to the ankle or foot and the other to just above the knee. The extent to which the hip spica covers the trunk depends greatly on the injury and the surgeon; the spica may extend only to the navel, allowing mobility of the spine and the possibility of walking with the aid of crutches, or may extend to the rib cage or even to the armpits in some rare cases. Hip spicas were formerly common in reducing femoral fractures, but today are rarely used except for congenital hip dislocations, and then mostly while the child is still an infant.
In some cases, a hip spica may only extend down one or more legs to above the knee. Such casts, called pantaloon casts, are occasionally seen to immobilize an injured lumbar spine or pelvis, in which case the trunk portion of the cast usually extends to the armpits.

Birds of Vermont Museum

The Birds of Vermont Museum (BOVM) is a non-profit institution established in 1987 in Huntington, Vermont USA. It was created to preserve and exhibit a collection of lifelike bird carvings for the purpose of educating people about the role of birds in the ecosystem. Today, the Museum is surrounded by a bird sanctuary and displays more than 495 biologically accurate woodcarvings created by Bob Spear, a Vermont naturalist and master woodcarver.
History.
Bob Spear, BOVM founding director, began carving birds in the 1950s. He realized early on that people can learn more about the beauty and identification of birds through observing carvings than from observing taxidermy specimens. Thus during the 1960s, he began carving birds specifically to use in demonstrations for school children. In 1979, when Spear retired, he started creating a collection of bird carvings in hopes of someday establishing a location where people could come to see them and learn about birds. Eight years later, the Museum was established with the assistance and support of the Museum's charter members, consisting of family and friends as well as other interested parties. When BOVM opened to the public in 1987, there were 231 completed nesting bird carvings in a gallery on one floor. Since that time, the Museum has grown to two floors and expanded the collection to include eight more exhibits. A bird observation window was added in the early 1990s along with the first floor exhibits, classroom facilities and a gift shop. In 1998, I. Riga joined the staff and eventually became the Museum's curator. Having previously studied art, she began carving birds under Spear's tutelage and eventually became his apprentice. As of 2008, Riga has completed six carvings for the wetland diorama. In 2004, BOVM was named a Vermont Important Bird Area (IBA) in conjunction with Green Mountain Audubon Center. A feeder cam was added to the Museum's website in 2005. In 2008 BOVM became an affiliate of Vermont eBird.
Exhibits.
The Museum features a variety of bird exhibits including a wetland diorama, a winter diorama, a raptor exhibit, an exhibit of endangered and extinct bird species, tropical birds, two displays depicting birds in the Lake Champlain Basin, and representations of 260 of Vermont's nesting birds portrayed in their native habitats with biologically accurate nests and eggs.
Programming.
In addition to the bird carving exhibits, BOVM offers bird walks along the Museum's nature trails, carving demonstrations, hosts lectures and art classes, and exhibits the work of local artists.
BOVM's varied habitat makes it a prime location for research programs. Current on-going projects include a wildflower inventory, a breeding bird survey, bird species point counts (joint project with Green Mountain Audubon Center), an annual butterfly count, and a mammal inventory.
Location.
The Museum is located on Sherman Hollow Road in Huntington, Vermont, six miles (10 km) south of Richmond village.

Gordon Lorenz

Gordon Lorenz (4 March 1943 – 5 June 2011) was an English songwriter and record producer, who made his fame by writing the UK Christmas number one hit "There's No-one Quite Like Grandma" for St Winifred’s School Choir. Since the song's release, Lorenz became one of the most prolific record producers in the music industry, producing over 800 albums (believed to be a world record), selling eight million records, and earning seventeen platinum, gold and silver discs.
Biography.
Born in Childwall, an affluent suburb of Liverpool, his parents were both members of the Salvation Army. He was a pupil of Evered Avenue school in Walton Liverpool from 1956 to 1959 after passing the 13+ exam. To improve projection of his voice, his parents sent him to drama school, where he was first introduced to show business. After leaving drama school he became a travelling evangelist, travelling the United Kingdom in support of various Salvation Army endeavours.
After his father died, he approached his mother nervously and told her that he wanted to become a full-time musician. After struggling for a while, he was offered a job by Border Television to write fill-in music between their various day time shows, where he was introduced to the recording studio: "I always liked working in studios. They don't have any windows, they're always very quiet, deliberately conducive to concentration and work."
Writer/producer.
In 1980, Lorenz wrote "There's No One Quite Like Grandma" to tie in with the Queen Mother's 80th birthday, and sent it to EMI. Having initially turned it down, the managing director rang me and said he decided to put it out because he said he could not get "grandma, we love you" out of his mind: "If it's caught in my mind chances are that it will with the public, and we'll put it out for Christmas". It was one of the last Christmas singles to sell one million copies, won an Ivor Novello Award for highest selling record of 1980 - beating Barbra Streisand's "Woman In Love" and The Police's "Don't Stand So Close to Me".
Subsequently employed full-time by EMI, Lorenz became one of the most prolific record producers in the music industry, producing over 800 albums (believed to be a world record), selling 8 million records, earning 17 platinum, gold and silver discs featuring some of the biggest international artists. After being asked by Unicef to help raise funds for children in Africa suffering from HIV and Aids, he produced "The Best Gospel Album In The World . . . Ever," which featured the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra, Royal Choral Society and Howells Girls Choir. He also produced the five album series "Your 100 Favourite Hymns" that are still the biggest-selling religious recordings in history. In 2002, Lorenz wrote the song "Rejoice Rejoice" for the Queen's Golden Jubilee, sung by a 1,000 strong choir conducted by Sir David Willcocks outside Buckingham Palace as the Queen left in her coach for a Thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral.
Approached by music manager Jonathan Shalit, Lorenz was asked to produce two songs for a 12 year old Charlotte Church, and introduce her to the recording studio. Lorenz recorded and produced her first two recordings, including the recording of "Pie Jesu".
Lorenz was a member of the British Academy of Composers and Authors, The Good Turns Society and The Music Publishers Association. He was also a vice-president of the Morriston Orpheus Choir and Llandudno Town Brass Band.
Death.
He died on 5 June 2011 at his home in Llandudno, Wales.

<doc id="18435763" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18435763" title="Chala (Jews)">
Chala (Jews)

Chala ( ) is an Uzbek term meaning "neither this nor that," referring to Bukharan Jews who were allegedly forcibly converted to Islam beginning in the late eighteenth century. In response, these Chala Jews outwardly practiced Islam, but secretly retained their Jewish traditions. These crypto-Jews married among themselves and lived in their own neighborhoods that bordered on existing Jewish neighborhoods. The Chala Jews carry a very similar story to the Marranos of Spain.
Chala Jews were unable to return to their true Jewish faith due to the fatal consequences associated with leaving the Islamic faith. The Islamic rulership during this period imposed a death penalty against those renouncing their Islamic faith. Therefore, it was not until the emergence of Imperial Russia, and Soviet rule that Chala Jews were able to revert to their original faith. Ironically, these crypto-Jews lived in nearby neighborhoods that sat next to existing Jewish neighborhoods, where there were openly practicing Jews living at the same time as the Chala. 
By the 19th century, there were Chala communities that emerged in the cities of: Samarkand, Khiva, Kokand, Margilan, and Shahrisabz. Often, it was not until two to three generations that Chala Jews would begin to intermarry with the local Muslim population and shed any remaining Jewish traditions.
The return of the Chala to Judaism began with the Russian conquest of Central Asia in 1867. While the Khiva and Kokand khanates were incorporated into the Turkestan governorate, the Bukhara Khanate remained autonomous and continued to enforce the death penalty against those who abandoned Islam. As a result, many Chala Jews illegally immigrated into Russian controlled areas, to escape the certain threat of death. Although Russian law required that these newcomers to be deported back to Bukhara and face an imminent death, the deportation orders were continuously delayed, and thus many had remained as permanent non-citizens of the Russian Turkestan region. Some Chala Jews also joined merchant guilds in order to prove their economic use to the empire. Because Muslim law was retained in Bukhara for a longer period than in surrounding cities, by the time communist Soviet rule arrived in Bukhara, many members of the local Chala no longer identified themselves as Jewish, and were fully assimilated into the Muslim population. 
Following the installation of Soviet rule in 1920, the religious distinction among the population was no longer officially recognized. Nevertheless, ethnic distinctions on passports enabled many Chala Jews to continue being counted as ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks, rather than Jews. 
In 2000, author Mansur Surosh published a novel "Chala ("The Outcasts")", which describes the experiences of the chala.

Peter Marchant

Peter Marchant (b. at Couvin, then in the prince-bishopric of Liege, in 1585; d. at Ghent, 11 November 1661) was a Belgian Franciscan theologian, who became involved in Irish affairs.
Life.
He entered the Franciscan Order in 1601, led an austere life and became a strict observer of the Franciscan Rule. He acquired a profound knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology, and for several years taught in the schools of his order. 
In 1625 he was elected definitor general of the order at the general chapter held in Rome; and in 1639 was appointed commissary general over the provinces of Germany, Belgium, Holland, Great Britain, and Ireland. His duties as commissary general brought him into contact with Irish politics during the times of the Confederation of Kilkenny. He took sides with the Ormondists and gave encouragement to their opposition to the nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini. 
He was called upon by the authorities of the order to justify his conduct in connection with the Irish question, and in 1661 he addressed to the general chapter then assembled in Rome his apologia under the title of "Relatio veridica et sincera status Provinciae Hiberniae", etc. This is a very rare book, never widely circulated and condemned by the general chapter; and ordered to be destroyed.
Works.
Marchant was a voluminous author. His major work is "Tribunal Sacramentale" (3 vols., Ghent, 1642; Antwerp, 1672), for the use of confessors. It contains a full exposition of moral theology. He puts aside all disputed opinions, and simply states the doctrinal teaching of the Catholic Church, drawing his proofs from Holy Scripture, the decisions of councils, the constant tradition of the Church, and the writings of the saints. The treatise on probabilism is lucid and complete. Its principles are within the restrictions placed on the doctrine later on by the decrees of Alexander VII and Innocent XI; and in many points match the doctrine subsequently propounded by Daniel writing against the "Lettres Provinciales". 
Marchant wrote several works on the cultus of St. Joseph. His work instituted "Sanctificatio S. Joseph Sponsi Virginis in utero asserta" (Bruges, s.d.), was placed on the Index, 19 March 1633. He also wrote "Baculus Pastoralis sive Potestas Episcoporum in Regulares exemptos ab originibus suis explicata" (Bruges, 1638); "Resolutiones notabiles variorum casuum et quaestionum a multis hactenus desideratae" (Antwerp, 1655). Many of his works are on the history and legislation of the Franciscan Order.
His brother James was the author of the "Hortus Pastorum".

Super Cr3w

Super Cr3w (pronounced "Super Crew" and also spelled "Super CR3W") is a breakdance crew from Las Vegas, Nevada who won the 2nd season of "America's Best Dance Crew".
Early history.
Before their popularity on ABDC, Super Cr3w was formed from three different b-boy dance crews (all from the west) and formed a "Super Crew" of their own.
Connection with JabbaWockeeZ.
"JabbaWockeeZ" and "Super CR3W" have a unique history together. Cristyle is a member of "Full Force Crew" with original "Super CR3W" member Ronnieboy before their ABDC wins. And in recent years, fellow '"JabbaWockeez" member Kid Rainen, had joined "Full Force", later adding "Super CR3W" members Do-Knock, Vex, & Rockadile to the crew. In May 2010, Jabbawockeez had their own show at the MGM Grand in Vegas and asked Ronnie, Do-Knock, Ben, and Rock from Super Cr3w to perform with them. Super Cr3w dressed up in masks and danced with the Jabbawockeez. The connection between the two crews is so strong that they often call themselves the "Super Wockeez" when they are together.
America’s Best Dance Crew Season 2.
Super Cr3w became America's Best Dance Crew's season two champions in August 2008.
Week 0: Live Audition’s Special.
Aired on June 7, 2008
Super CR3W was introduced to audiences through a series of questions by judges JC Chasez, Shane Sparks and Lil Mama. JC Chasez asked to hear more about the "very accomplished B-boys" in the crew, to which Do-Knock replied about having "some nasty cats" on his squad, stating members' individual accomplishments such as Ronnie's 2007 Red Bull BC One championship, Murda and Ben's two-time Battle of the Year wins, and his own Star Search win.
Week 1: Crew's Choice Challenge.
Each crew performed to songs of their own choosing. Super CR3W selected the song "Get Up Offa That Thing" by James Brown and performed in Ninja costumes.
Accordingly, their dance moves were Ninja-influenced. Super CR3W was in the bottom 5, but after their performance to "Get Up Offa That Thing", Super CR3W's fanbase quickly grew and Super Cr3w became one of the top contenders. Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas was seen during this episode holding up the Super CR3W hand sign right after their performance.
Week 2: Video Star Challenge.
Each crew was given a different video with a dance sequence in it, which they had to perform while keeping their own style as a crew.
Super CR3W was given the music video for "Run It!" by Chris Brown. They used the element of krumping from the video and mixed it in with B-boy moves such as the deuce deuce. JC Chasez said afterward that he saw more tricks than dancing and would like to see actual dance moves incorporated into their next performance, to which Shane Sparks countered to by saying break dancing and tricks is dancing. hey!
Week 3: Rock The Title Challenge.
Each crew was given a song whose title was used as inspiration for their dance.
Super CR3W received the song "We Fly High" by Jim Jones. As part of the challenge, they dressed in Clark Kent uniforms and performed "flying" moves such as Ben's air flare and the crew's airplane transformation. The judges, especially Shane Sparks, were ecstatic with Super CR3W's performance, complimenting the crew's ability to complete the challenge they were given. Chris Gatdula, member of The Jabbawockeez, Super CR3W and Full Force, from season 1 of America’s Best Dance Crew were seen wearing Super CR3W's t-shirts and cheering for them.
Week 4: Speed Up Challenge.
Crews must transition from a slow song to a faster one while still remaining on beat.
Super CR3W chose the song “Creator” by Santogold. Jon Cruz dressed as a graffiti artist while the rest of the crew were painted gold to replicate gold statues. For the challenge, the crew used the 6-step B-boy move at an incrementing speed to transition from slow to fast.
Week 5: Janet Jackson Challenge.
Each crew was given a Janet Jackson song and had to incorporate some of her moves into their dance, similar to the Michael Jackson challenge of Season 1.
Super CR3W received Black Cat by Janet Jackson. For the first time ever, Super CR3W was in the bottom two against A.S.I.I.D. However, Super Cr3w managed to beat A.S.I.I.D and remain in the competition. Shane Sparks told Super Cr3w that "they're finally back!"
Week 6: Bring The Beat Challenge.
Each crew was given a song and a school subject to use as the theme for this week's prop-oriented dance routines.
Super CR3W was given the song "Don't Touch Me" by Busta Rhymes and the subject of basketball. For the second time in the show (and in a row), they were in the bottom two, this time against Supreme Soul, but once again they were saved from elimination.
Week 7: Missy Elliott Challenge.
Each crew was given a song by Missy Elliott and had to adapt the videos' innovative footwork to showcase their own style.
Super CR3W was given the song "We Run This" by Missy Elliott They were not in the bottom 2 this time. All three judges gave them praise and positive feedback, and guest judge Missy Elliott claimed Super CR3W's choreography was so hot, they made her video "look wack" as a compliment to show how great their performance was.
Week 8: 80's theme Challege.
Using the songs "Bust A Move" by Young MC, "Humpty Dance" by Digital Underground and "Word Up" by Cameo, Super CR3W had to create a routine using a dance from the 80s. Like the "Dance Craze Challenge" from Season 1, crews were given a physical challenge to complete during their routine. Super CR3W had to perform the Humpty Dance with only 4 feet on the floor.
Crews must create a routine that incorporates elements of an 80s dance movie. Similar to the "Broadway Challenge" from Season 1, crews were given remixed versions of the songs from their respective movies. Super CR3W were given the movie "Footloose". All three judges gave Super CR3W high praises for both of their amazing performances this week.
Week 9: Championship Showdown.
World Dance Challenge
Both crews had to create a 2 minute routine that had different forms of world dance such as Latin, Reggae, Punjabi dance, and African Music. The songs included "Mas Que Nada" by Sérgio Mendes featuring The Black Eyed Peas, "We Be Burnin'" by Sean Paul, "The Anthem" by Pitbull featuring Lil Jon, and "Mundian to Bach Ke" by Panjabi MC featuring Twista. Only Super Cr3w received raving reviews from the judges
Both crews had to create their own dance craze and had to record their own music for it. Super Crew recorded "S to the chest" by Super Cr3w.
Crews will create a routine that shows why they should be crowned "America’s Best Dance Crew". Super Cr3w performed to "Give It Up or Turn It Loose" by James Brown.
Week 10: Live Finale.
Super Cr3w and SoReal Cru opened the show with a special performance together. SuperCr3w came out in a jacket that was half of the Philippine flag and half of the Puerto Rican flag because half the crew was Filipino the other half is Puerto Rican. All crews later came together to dance for their respective regions, and Super Cr3w teamed up with Fanny Pak and Supreme Soul to represent the west coast. A total of 39 million votes were submitted and Super Cr3w were crowned the title of America’s Best Dance Crew.

Bateman's 'Great Landowners' (1883)

John Bateman FRGS (1839–1910) published in 1883 the fourth edition of his "The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, A list of all owners of Three thousand acres and upwards, worth £3,000 a year; Also, one thousand three hundred owners of Two thousand acres and upwards, in England, Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, their acreage and income from Land, Culled from 'THE MODERN DOMESDAY BOOK'", under the Harrison imprint.

Grand Temple of Mount Heng

Grand Temple of Mount Heng, or Grand Temple of South Mountain (Chinese: 南岳大庙; Nanyue Damiao) is located at the foot of Mount Heng, and on the north of ancient town of Mount Heng in Hengshan County of Hunan. It is the largest temple on Mount Heng. It is a major component of Mount Heng National Key Tourist Resort Zone. 
History.
The Grand Temple was initially called Heaven Governor Huo King Temple (司天霍王庙), and later, the name changed to South Heaven Genuine Master Temple (南天真君祠). Its founding year is unknown. The earliest documented records show that it was built in Kaiyuan 13th year (AD. 725) of Tang Dynasty. The temple experienced Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, having suffered six fires and undergone 16 large-scale renovations. At the end of Ming Dynasty, the temple was burnt in the war. In Guangxu 8th year (1882) of Qing Dynasty, the temple was rebuilt following the layout of Forbidden City in Beijing, thus it was also called "Little Palace in South China". The majority of the buildings have been preserved till today. During Cultural Revolution, the temple was regarded as engendering the values of the "Four Olds", and suffered extensive damage. The stone tablets, inscribed boards, Buddhist statues and scripts were all destroyed. Starting in 1980s, continuous renovation projects have rehabilitated destroyed buildings and statues.
Architecture.
The temple covers a land area of over 98,500 m2. Along its axis there are 9 major buildings. From south to north, they are Lingxing Gate, Kuixing Pavilion, Zhengchuan Gate, Imperial Tablet Pavilion, Jiaying Gate, Imperial Liberary Tower, Grand Hall, Refreshing Palace and North Hind Gate. Its eastern and western sides accommodate Eight Temples of Taoism and Eight Temples of Buddhism. 
The name of Lingxing Gate means abundant talents emerge and serve the country. Usually, "Lingxing" wouldn't be used to name a temple gate. There're only two exceptions in China, and the other Lingxing Gate is in Temple of Confucius. Kuixing Pavilion is also called "Panlong Pavilion" (literally, Circling Dragon Pavilion). It has double-eave two-curve roof and covers 139 m2. It serves as an opera stage.
There is a tablet in Imperial Tablet Pavilion bestowed by emperor Kangxi, on which "Temple of Mount Heng Renovation Memorial" was inscribed, comprising 279 characters written by the emperor himself. The first sentence reads, "Mount Heng is the giant pillar in South. It corresponds to Star Yu Heng of Big Dipper, and is also called Mount Longevity." Mount Heng's another name, Mount Longevity, was thereafter determined by the authority. The original tablet was destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.
Culture.
Three religions, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucius, co-exist in the Grand Temple of Mount Heng. Eight Temples of Taoism, Eight Temples of Buddhism and Imperial Library Tower represent the convergence of three religions. The temple enjoys great popularity among devotees. Large Buddhist festivals are held in Buddhist holidays each year. Pilgrims come not only from nearby Hunan and Guangdong, but also from Hong Kong, Macao, Southeast Asia and Japan. There was originally a statue of Mountain God (Yue Shen) in the Grand Hall, to which the past emperors all paid tribute. In early Tang Dynasty, the god was designated "Heavenly Governor Huo King". In Kaiyuan years of Tang, it was titled "Genuine Master of Mount Heng". In Song Dynasty, it was named "Heavenly Governor Zhaosheng Emperor". Today, the existent "Superior Emperor of Mount Heng" was rebuilt in 1983, for the original statue was destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. There are also two "Treasury Houses" on each side of the Grand Hall. Facing from the hall, the one on the left side is designed for worship by living people, while the one on the right hosts the name boards of the deceased. 
In 1990, the Chinese National Post Bureau issued a series of Mount Heng stamps (T155), comprising 4 pieces. The first one, "Grand Temple", depicted this temple.

Wildseed Farms is a wildflower farm near Fredericksburg, Texas, United States. It is the largest working wildflower farm in the country. The farm won the "Garden Center" 2001 Innovator award.
The farm opened in 1983 in Eagle Lake as a seed producer and initially only allowed the public to visit in April of every year. These visit days proved to be extremely popular, so much so that the owners, John and Marilyn Thomas, decided to relocate to a more accessible location. In 1995, they purchased the plot on Texas State Highway 290. Development for a retail facility and visitor center was completed in 1997. Because the farm is located near Fredericksburg, a town that has a 19th-century feel to it, the main buildings of the farm were also constructed to match the decor of the town.
Wildseed Farms does about $4 million in sales each year, with approximately $1.5 million coming from the retail facility, which can see roughly 100,000 visitors between March and May of each year. Besides plant sales, the farm also has a butterfly area and hosts live concerts and other attractions.

1986–87 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1986-87 campaign saw the end of Mick Buxton's reign as Huddersfield Town manager, a job he had had for 8 years. Only Clem Stephenson has had a longer reign as manager of the Terriers. He was replaced by Steve Smith in early January 1987, but Town only survived relegation by 3 points, which became a sort of precursor to the debacle that the next season's campaign would bring.
Review.
The start of the season was mixed, with no win until September 20, when they beat Oldham Athletic 5-4 at Leeds Road. The main highlight of the early part of the season was a Littlewoods Cup tie against Arsenal, in which Town only lost 3-1 on aggregate.
The middle part of the season didn't prove to be much better, a run of 4 consecutive losses including a 4-3 loss at Bradford City, but that was reconciled when they beat them 5-2 on December 27. Just before beating Bradford, Mick Buxton's tenure as Town manager ended after 8 years in charge. He was replaced by coach Steve Smith.
Smith's tenure started with a 4-2 defeat by Norwich City, but during March, Town went on a run of six consecutive draws - a club record. Town finished the season in 17th, just 3 points and 3 places above the drop zone. Little did Town fans know what was going to happen to Town the following season.

Winterbourne Junior Boys' School

Winterbourne Junior Boys' School is a junior school for boys aged between 7 and 11 years. Along with its sister Girls' School, the schools are the last remaining single-sex, local authority-maintained, junior schools in the UK.
General information.
The school is located on Winterbourne Road in Thornton Heath. The Local Education Authority for the school is the London Borough of Croydon. The school caters for pupils from Year 3 to Year 6. The uniform of the school is a grey jumper with the school logo, white shirt and grey or black trousers (a sweatshirt with the school logo is also available, as is a fleece jacket). There are approximately 250 pupils on roll (as of February 2011) with a maximum of 30 pupils in each of 8 classes (2 classes per year group). From September 2007, there has been an additional class in the morning sessions: from September until April (when the Year 6 SATs take place) this consists of some pupils from each of the two Year 6 classes, and from April until July this consists of some pupils from each of the two Year 5 classes.
History.
The school was opened in 1906 as a combined Boys, Girls and Infants school on 27 August 1906, but became three separate schools on 6 January 1907. It was originally called "Winterbourne Road School".
"The following information is based on the publication printed for the school's centenary "Winterbourne Times 1907-2007" "
At the turn of the 20th century, it was decided that a school was needed in the locality, as the nearest school was Ecclesbourne. The Board of Education in Whitehall purchased land in Winterbourne Road, and initially decided to call the school "Winterbourne Road Board School". The new school (with three departments: Boys, Girls, Infants) would cater for 1200 pupils.
At first, owing to the large numbers awaiting admission to the school, one department was opened in August 1906 as a temporary mixed school with accommodation for 540 with two classes of 50 pupils in the school hall.
In January 1907, the school was finally completed as follows:
The War Memorial.
There was a war memorial in the building commemorating two former Masters and 50 old boys. The first pupils of the school were just of an age to serve in World War I. Although the memorial itself is now lost, the inscription is known (links are to known entries at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website):
Centenary Celebrations.
In the summer of 2007, the schools on the site joined in celebrations to mark the centenary of the schools' opening.
This culminated in the unveiling of a plaque by the Mayor of Croydon in front of the pupils of all three schools, followed by the mass release of ballons.

FS Class D.345

The FS Class D.345 is a class of diesel-electric locomotive used in Italy, introduced in the 1970s and still in service.
History.
After the positive experience with class D.343, in 1970 Italian state railways, Ferrovie dello Stato, ordered further 70 diesel locomotives with some minor improvements. The FIAT engine was confirmed, while the Breda-engine was to be abandoned and a new, more reliable cooling system was fitted. The locomotives were manufactred by FIAT, Breda and SOFER, with electrical equipment provided by Magneti Marelli, TIBB and Italtrafo. The last unit was delivered in 1979.
Description.
The D.345's structure is very similar to that of D.343. The central compartment, housing the engine, the generator and the cooling system, is missing the baggage room, which had been never used in the previous class. The engine is a 4+4 V cylinder FIAT 218SSF with direct fuel injection, with a power output of 1,350 HP at 1500 rpm.
The electric generator is a DC one produced by Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB), with a power of . The electric motors, one for each bogie, were produced by Ansaldo.
The command circuit includes electro-pneumatic switches and relays, located in a large cabin in the front cab. D345 also introduced a static regulation with field-weakening (shunting) of the traction motors, which is divided in five levels that are automatically inserted (one at time on each motor) when the throttle controller (which looks like a steering wheel and has 13 positions) is in any notch between 10 and 13.

SMS Leopard

SMS "Leopard" was a torpedo cruiser ("Torpedoschiff") of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She and her sister ship, SMS "Panther", were part of a program to build up Austria-Hungary's fleet of torpedo craft in the 1880s.
Design.
The Austro-Hungarian Navy Commander ("Marinekommandant"), Vice Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, outlined in a memorandum of 8 September 1884 the requirements for a torpedo ram cruiser. Such a vessel should have a reinforced bow for ramming as well as torpedoes for attacks on larger warships. The cruisers would also be small and fast enough to undertake patrol and reconnaissance duties. They were originally classified as "torpedo ships" ("Torpedoschiff") - equivalent of a torpedo cruiser in other navies. In 1903 they were reclassified as 3rd Class Cruisers, then in 1909 as small cruisers ("Kleine Kreuzer").
When funds for two vessels were approved by the Austro-Hungarian Reichsrat, bids were solicited from British builders. The order went to the firm of W.G. Armstrong of Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, and its chief designer, William White (afterwards the British Director of Naval Construction from 1885 to 1902).
As designed by White, "Leopard" was a steel-hulled vessel of 1,557 tons displacement. She measured 240 feet nine inches in length with a beam of 34 feet 11 inches and a draft (as completed) of 14 feet five inches. Propulsion was supplied by two compound steam engines with four cylindrical boilers, giving a maximum speed of 19.4 knots. The crew numbered 186 officers and men.
Original armament of "Leopard" comprised two 12 cm Krupp guns, four 4.7 cm quick-firing guns, six 4.7 cm revolver cannon and four 14-inch torpedo tubes. The torpedo tubes were located singly, in the bow, stern, and at either beam. Leopard was built with as pronounced a ram bow as the larger Austro-Hungarian warships of the time.
Service.
"Leopard" was launched 10 September 1885. The Austro-Hungarian supervising naval architect, Siegfried Popper, found that the ship's draft aft was four feet 11 inches deeper than intended.
After lengthy disagreement, White (by now DNC) and the shipyard admitted the error, which was partly offset through a redistribution a weight, reducing the excessive draft to two feet five inches.
Upon completion, "Leopard" was leader of a torpedo boat flotilla. She and "Panther" represented Austria-Hungary at the Barcelona World's Exposition in 1888. In 1891 "Leopard's" four 4.7 cm quick-firing guns were replaced with ten 4.7 cm guns. She was reclassified as a 3rd Class cruiser in 1903 and as a small cruiser ("Kleiner Kreuzer") in 1909. Also in 1909, the aft torpedo tube was removed and four 6.6 cm guns were added to her armament.
"Leopard" was taken out of service and placed in reserve in 1910. The "Panther", however, was used for shore bombardment and as a seagoing training ship during the First World War, and
was decommissioned only weeks before Austria-Hungary's collapse. In the spring of 1915 "Leopard" briefly served as a training ship for the torpedo school. She was employed for subsidiary local defense at Pola from May 1915 to November 1918. Both ships were then allocated to Britain as a war reparation in 1920, but subsequently sold and scrapped in Italy.

African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation

The African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation was adopted in February 1990 at the "International Conference on Popular Participation in the Recovery and Development Process in Africa", Arusha, Tanzania.
The Charter was officially adopted at the Twenty-fifth session of the Economic Commission for Africa and Sixteenth meeting of the Economic Commission for Africa Conference of Ministers responsible for Economic Planning and Development.
The Charter was adopted in the context of a deterioration of social and economic conditions in African countries in the 1980s and ratifying parties thought that the lack of "full appreciation of the role popular participation (see public participation plays in the process of recovery and development" was partly to blame.
The Charter was initiated by NGOs, grass-roots organisations and African Governments. The Charter emerged NGO suggestions the 1988 mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990 (UN-PAAERD), which established a framework co-operation between Africa and the international community.
The then UN Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar stated, in a message to the "International Conference on Popular Participation in the Recovery and Development Process in Africa" that "The continent needs to enter the 1990s with a clean slate, economically speaking, if it is to grasp the opportunities offered by the profound changes of the 1980s", calling for diversification of African national economies, the creation of larger markets, investment in social and economic infrastructure, "and the page needs to be turned on its external indebtedness". Cuellar underlined that in the long run, the recovery and development must be determined by Africa itself and by "the vibrant cultures of its peoples".

Neustadt–Dürkheim Railway Company

The Neustadt–Dürkheim Railway Company ("Neustadt-Dürkheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft )" or NDE was an early German railway company dating from the final decade of Bavarian independence. It was founded on 22 October 1862, by a committee of leading citizens from Deidesheim and Bad Dürkheim. The railway ran from north to south, connecting Durkheim (which since 1904 has been known as Bad Dürkheim) at the northern end to Neustadt an der Haardt (since 1950 known as Neustadt an der Weinstraße) at the southern end. The largest intermediate town was Deidesheim.
The company worked closely with the Palatine Ludwigsbahn Company to which it transferred operational and administrative control. During the subsequent decades the economic focus of the region was drawn twenty kilometers to the east as the higher wage levels available from the burgeoning chemical industry in nearby Ludwigshafen drew earning and spending power away from the axis followed by the line south from Bad Dürkheim. The railway was opened on 6 May 1865, but was not as profitable as had been foreseen. 
On January 1, 1870, the three largest railway companies in the region were united under the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) and the NDE was wound up. Its assets were transferred to the Palatine Northern Railway. Three and a half years later, on July 20, 1873, a continuation beyond Bad Dürkheim opened: this extended the line as far north as Grünstadt.
The three united private railways remained officially independent until they were nationalised on 1 January 1909, and merged into the Royal Bavarian State Railways.

North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization

The North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization (NFRMPO) is an association of 15 local governments working together to improve regional transportation and air quality. The NFRMPO does long-range and short-range planning, and prioritizes which projects in those plans will receive state and federal funding. The goal of the NFRMPO is to enhance air quality and mobility among northern Colorado communities, and between the North Front Range and the Denver Metro area, by developing cooperative working relationships and financial partnerships among our member governments: Berthoud, Eaton, Evans, Fort Collins, Garden City, Greeley, Johnstown, Larimer County, LaSalle, Loveland, Milliken, Severance, Timnath, Weld County, and Windsor, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the private sector, giving local governments a voice in regional transportation planning.
History.
For almost 20 years, the NFRMPO has worked to promote a regional perspective on one of the most pressing issues facing the North Front Range: transportation.
Governor Roy Romer created the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization in 1988 with nine members. Five years later, four other towns joined the organization, giving the MPO 13 members: Larimer County, Weld County, Berthoud, Evans, Fort Collins, Garden City, Greeley, Johnstown, LaSalle, Loveland, Milliken, Timnath and Windsor. In 2007, Eaton and Severance also joined the membership.
In 1993, the Governor designated the NFRMPO Planning Council as the lead air quality planning organization for the North Front Range, giving it additional responsibilities in transportation related air quality planning.
NFRMPO is a nonprofit public organization funded through federal and state grants, and local funds. The goal of the NFRMPO is to enhance air quality and mobility among northern Colorado communities, and between the North Front Range and the Denver Metro, by developing cooperative working relationships and financial partnerships among our member governments, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the private sector.

Dick Larkins

Richard C. "Dick" Larkins (April 19, 1909 – April 7, 1977) was the athletic director at the Ohio State University from 1947 to 1970. Larkins also played tackle for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team in the 1910s and served on the Ohio State faculty as a professor of physical education.
In one of his first acts as Ohio State athletic director, Larkins hired his old teammate, Wes Fesler, to take over as Ohio State's football coach. Larkins also became involved in a public feud with legendary coach Paul Brown in 1948. A story in the "Minneapolis Times" quoted Larkins as saying: "Brown has started a terrific drive in Columbus and all around Ohio to return as football coach at Ohio State. Brown is not happy in the pro atmosphere. He has a good bank account and wants to coach college kids again." Larkins was also quoted as saying that Brown has been "stealing football players off our campus by the dozen" and that Brown had "done everything in his power to hurt Ohio State." Brown accused Larkins of conducting a smear campaign, and Larkins claimed he had been mis-quoted.
He is also remembered as the Ohio State athletic director who made the decision to proceed with the historic Snow Bowl game against Michigan in 1950. Despite extraordinarily inclement weather, Larkins decided to play the game "due to the number of people who attended, and the mess it would have created to refund the tickets." Ohio State lost the game 9-3.
Larkins drew national media attention for his comments in 1951 criticizing big-time college football as a Frankenstein monster. In the remarks, Larkins said:"Football is being ruined. It's getting completely out of hand. It's a Frankenstein, a monster. Football is killing itself. ... College football is too big for its breeches. ... These 80,000-90,000 Roman holidays are not good for college athletics. They're killing it. You'll never know the pressures on us in this coaching situation. The outside pressures, the outside interference! It's just terrific. I don't know how much longer educators can put up with this stuff. We're educational institutions, we're not the New York Yankees or Chicago Bears."
However, Larkins is best remembered as the driving force behind the 1951 hiring of Woody Hayes as Ohio State's football coach. Ironically, Larkins' decision to hire the little-known Hayes, over former Buckeyes' coach Paul Brown, led to petitions being circulated on campus calling for Larkins' removal; the petition claimed that Larkins "has lost confidence of the Ohio State student body" over his opposition to Brown's return as football coach. Larkins became Hayes' strongest supporter at the university and protected Hayes after numerous clashes and against efforts by university administrators to fire him. Larkins and Hayes became close friends; in 1979, Hayes recalled: "My greatest friends are always people that I fight with. Bo (Schembechler) was one of those. ... That was true with Dick Larkins (former athletic director at Ohio State). We were always arguing but agreed on everything."
In 1970, Larkins became the fourth recipient of the James J. Corbett Memorial Award, presented by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics "to the collegiate administrator who through the years has most typified Corbett's devotion to intercollegiate athletics and worked unceasingly for its betterment."
Larkins Hall on the Ohio State Campus was named for Dick Larkins. The building served as the recreation and physical activity center for a number of years. It was torn down in the early-2000s to build the new Recreation and Physical Activity Center (RPAC).

John Brande Morris

John Brande Morris, known to friends as Jack Morris (born at Brentford, Middlesex, 4 September 1812; died at Hammersmith, London, 9 April 1880) was an English Anglican theologian, later a Roman Catholic priest. He was a noted academic eccentric, but an important scholar of Syriac.
Life.
He studied at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1834 (B.A. honours) and 1837 (M.A.), He was at once elected Petrean Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, lecturing on Hebrew and Syriac. 
Having joined the Tractarian Movement, in 1839 Morris was briefly left to deputize for John Henry Newman at St Mary's, Oxford, the university church: he alarmed his audience with a sermon on angels and fasting, "declaring "inter alia" that the brute creation should be made to fast on fast days". His next sermon, which preached the doctrine of transubstantiation, and "added in energetic terms that everyone was an unbeliever, carnal, and so forth, who did not hold it", earned him an admonition from the university vice-chancellor. His views on fasting and celibacy, explained in a letter of 1840 to his close friend F. W. Faber, earned him the nickname 'Simeon Stylites'.
It was little surprise when Morris was received into the Catholic Church, 16 January 1846, resigning his Oxford fellowship a few days later. He was ordained at Oscott in 1851 and in the same year was appointed professor at Prior Park, near Bath. He soon began parish work and for the next nineteen years ministered in Plymouth, Shortwood (Somerset), and other parts of England. 
From 1855 to 1861, he served as chaplain to Sir John Acton, but offended Acton by his preaching, too explicit on the topic of the breasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Though from 1868 to 1870, he managed to secure work as chaplain to Coventry Patmore, friends had to organize a fund for his relief in 1871. 
In 1870, he became spiritual director of a Hammersmith community of nursing nuns, the Soeurs de Miséricorde, a post he occupied until his death, on 9 April 1880.
Works.
His favourite field of study was Eastern and patristic theology. While at Oxford he wrote an "Essay towards the Conversion of Learned and Philosophical Hindus" (1843); a poem entitled "Nature: a Parable" (1842); and translated "Select Homilies from St. Ephraem" from the Syriac (1846), likewise John Chrysostom's "Homilies on the Romans" (1841) for the "Library of the Fathers".

Villarreal CF B

Villarreal Club de Fútbol B is a Spanish football team based in Villarreal, in the autonomous community of Valencia. Founded in 1999, it is the reserve team of Villarreal CF and plays in Segunda División B – Group 3, holding home games at "Ciudad Deportiva Villarreal CF", with a 5,000-seat capacity.
Unlike in England, reserve teams in Spain play in the same football pyramid as their senior team rather than a separate league. However, reserve teams cannot play in the same division as their senior team. Therefore, the team is ineligible for promotion to the division in which the main side plays. Also, if the main team is relegated to the division in which its reserve side played in the prior season (which happened in 2011–12), the reserve team is automatically relegated to the division below the main team. Reserve teams are also no longer permitted to enter the Copa del Rey.

Massera's lemma

In stability theory and nonlinear control, Massera's lemma, named after José Luis Massera, deals with the construction of the Lyapunov function to prove the stability of a dynamical system. The lemma appears in as the first lemma in section 12, and in more general form in as lemma 2. In 2004, Massera's original lemma for single variable functions was extended to the multivariable case, and the resulting lemma was used to prove the stability of switched dynamical systems, where a common Lyapunov function describes the stability of multiple modes and switching signals.
Massera's original lemma.
Massera’s lemma is used in the construction of a converse Lyapunov function of the following form (also known as the integral construction)
for an asymptotically stable dynamical system whose stable trajectory starting from formula_2
The lemma states:
Let formula_3 be a positive, continuous, strictly decreasing function with formula_4 as formula_5. Let formula_6 be a positive, continuous, nondecreasing function. Then there exists a function formula_7 such that

Their presidential ticket was only on the ballot in Tennessee. He was a critic of the Clinton administration and his stated intention in creating the party and running for office was to "create the illusion of an AIDS voting bloc, and AIDS will become a small part of the media coverage." He had also run in the New Hampshire primaries, receiving a "couple hundred" votes there.[http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=11836

American Stoneware

The term American Stoneware refers to the predominant houseware of 19th century North America—stoneware pottery usually covered in a salt glaze and often decorated using cobalt oxide to produce bright blue decorations. The vernacular term "crocks" is often used to describe this type of pottery, though the term "crock" is not seen in period documents describing the ware. Additionally, while other types of stoneware were produced in America concurrently with it—for instance, ironstone, yellowware, and various types of china—in common usage of the term, "American Stoneware" refers to this specific type of pottery.
Stoneware is a type of pottery. It was fired to a high temperature (about 1200°C to 1315°C). While it originated in the Rhineland area of Germany circa 1400s, it became the dominant houseware of the United States of America circa 1780-1890.
Americans began producing salt-glazed stoneware circa 1720 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Yorktown, Virginia. By the 1770s, the art of salt-glazed stoneware production had spread to many centers throughout the United States, most notably Manhattan, New York. There the Crolius and Remmey families (two of the most important families in the history of American pottery production) would, by the turn of the 19th century, set the standard for expertly crafted and aesthetically pleasing American stoneware. By 1820, stoneware was being produced in virtually every American urban center, with potters from Baltimore, Maryland, in particular raising the craft to its pinnacle.
While salt-glazing is the typical glaze technique seen on American Stoneware, other glaze methods were employed by the potters. For instance, vessels were often dipped Albany Slip, a mixture made from a clay peculiar to the Upper Hudson Region of New York, and fired, producing a dark brown glaze. Albany Slip was also sometimes used as a glaze to coat the inside surface of salt-glazed ware.
While decorated ware was usually adorned using cobalt oxide, American Stoneware potters used other decorative techniques. Incising, a method in which a design of flowering plants, birds, or some other decoration was cut into the leather-hard clay using a stylus, produced detailed, recessed images on the vessels; these were usually also highlighted in cobalt. Stamped or coggled designs were sometimes impressed into the leather-hard clay, as well. Potters occasionally substituted manganese or iron oxide for cobalt oxide to produce brown, instead of blue, decorations on the pottery.
In the last half of the 19th century, potters in New England and New York state began producing stoneware with elaborate figural designs such as deer, dogs, birds, houses, people, historical scenes and other fanciful motifs including elephants and "bathing beauties."
A significant percentage of American Stoneware was signed using maker's marks and, much more rarely, incised signatures. Many pieces can be attributed to particular makers based on the cobalt decoration, clay body, form, etc. The gallon capacity of the vessels was often denoted using numeral stamps or incised or cobalt oxide numbers or hash marks applied in freehand.
American Stoneware was valued as not only a durable, decorative houseware but as a safer alternative to lead-glazed earthenware pottery produced in America before and during its production there. This earthenware, commonly referred to today as American Redware, was often produced by the same potters making American Stoneware.
Stoneware manufacturers of note include:

You're the Greatest LUVer

You're the Greatest LUVer is a German 1998 compilation album by Dutch girl group Luv' which features hit singles and album tracks from the formation's heyday (1977 - 1981). <br>
As the female pop trio dominated the charts in a large part of Continental Europe in the late 1970s, Germany was Luv's biggest export market. They had eight entries on the German singles charts: You're the Greatest Lover (a #1 hit that reached the gold status as it sold 600.000 units in Germany alone), Trojan Horse ( a Top 3 song), Casanova (a Top 10 single), Eeny Meeny Miny Moe, Ooh, Yes I Do, Ann-Maria, One More Little Kissie and My Number One.
Album history.
In 1979, Patty Brard, José Hoebee, Marga Scheide, their producers (Hans van Hemert and Piet Souer) and their manager (Pim Ter Linde) received the Conamus Export Prize for being Holland's best export act.<br>
Germany was a key territory for the group and helped them to score successful hit records outside their homeland. Luv' was a household name thanks to their performances on German TV shows such as Starparade, Tanzparty, Musikladen and Disco. During their brief German glory, You're the Greatest Lover was used for the soundtrack of an episode of the Derrick TV series. Moreover, Luv' played a cameo role in the
movie Cola, Candy,Chocolate (aka Drei Kesse Bienen auf den Philippinen) in which they performed Trojan Horse.<br>
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the trio success in Goethe's country, Mercury Records decided to release the compilation You're the Greatest LUVer.<br> 
Nowadays, the trio's greatest hits (like the "Greatest Lover" and "Trojan Horse") are often included on German 1970's/Disco various artists compilation albums or downloadable as ringtones.
