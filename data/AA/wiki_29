Arkansas Razorbacks football, 1960–69

__NOTOC__
1962.
Overview.
Quarterback Billy Moore was voted an All-American. Moore scored 14 touchdowns, which tied him with Miami University's kicker Bob Jencks in scoring. Future Razorback head coach Ken Hatfield finished second in the country in punt return yards, behind Utah State's Darrell Roberts. Razorback Kicker Tom McKnelly was fourth in kick scoring, with 33 extra points and 3 field goals. 
The Hog offensive unit averaged 5.0 yards per play, and 357 yards per game, the seventh-best mark in 1962. Arkansas also averaged 28.6 points per game, the fifth highest average nationally. Running on the Razorback defense was tough, as the unit gave up 90.7 yards per contest, the seventh-lowest total in the nation. 
Arkansas, despite a 9–2 record, finished second in the SWC to Texas, who was 9–1–1, losing only in the Cotton Bowl Classic to the Tigers of LSU, 13–0.
Sugar Bowl.
The 1963 Sugar Bowl matched up rivals Arkansas and Ole Miss in the Razorbacks second straight Sugar Bowl, and fourth bowl in four seasons. The Rebels also had reached four consecutive bowl games. 
After each team kicked field goals, Ole Miss scored the first touchdown, a 33 yard strike from Glynn Griffing to Louis Guy gave the Rebels a 10–3 lead. The Hogs replied with a five-yard touchdown toss from Billy Moore to knot the game at 10. Ole Miss QB Griffing then scored on a one-yard touchdown scamper. The Razorbacks would tack on a field goal, but as neither team could dent the scoreboard in the fourth quarter, would lose by a 17–13 final.

1963.
Overview.
Ken Hatfield led the nation in punt return yards, gaining 350 on 21 returns. Razorback Ronnie Caveness set a school record in the Texas game with 29 tackles. The NCAA record is 30, set in 2001.
1964.
Overview.
Razorback Guard Ronnie Caveness was named an All-American. Ken Hatfield again led the nation in punt return yards, with 518. Tom McKnelly scored 45 points kicking 27 extra points and 6 field goals, tied him with LSU's Doug Moreau for fourth place nationally. 
Arkansas' total defense was fourth-best, allowing only 180.5 yards per game, while the scoring defense was the best in the land, giving up only 5.7 points per game.
Cotton Bowl Classic.
Arkansas and Nebraska met for the first time in the 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas, Texas. Arkansas' number-one rated defense was giving up only 5.7 points per game, where Nebraska's #7 scoring offense was scoring 24.9 points per contest. 
A standing room only crowd watched as the Hogs opened the scoring on a Tom McKnelly field goal, but the Huskers responded with a Harry Wilson punching it in from one yard out. The third quarter passed with no scoring before Bobby Burnett of Arkansas ran in for the go ahead touchdown. Despite being named the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll national champion, #1 Alabama could not hold off Texas in the Orange Bowl, which left Arkansas to take the number one spot in the FWAA Poll and a share of that year's national championship.

National Championship.
Arkansas was invited to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic on January 1, 1965 against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. The Razorbacks went on to beat the Cornhuskers 10–7 and were selected as national champions by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation as the #1 Alabama Crimson Tide lost their bowl game against the Texas Longhorns, a team Arkansas had beaten in Austin. Because the final AP and Coaches (UPI) Polls were released before bowl games were played at the time, the Crimson Tide was selected national champions by the AP and Coaches' (UPI) Polls. Because of the controversy, the AP Poll experimented with a voting model that took the final vote to select their champion after the bowl games in the 1965 season. In 1966, the AP Poll went back to taking the final vote at the conclusion of the regular season before finally adopting the post- bowl season model in 1968. The Coaches' Poll adopted the post-bowl season model in 1974 after the controversies surrounding the 1964, 1965, 1970, and 1973 national championships, seasons in which the winner of the Coaches' Poll went on to lose their bowl game.
1965.
Overview.
Bobby Burnett tied three others in scoring, with 16 TD's, the fourth-highest total in the nation. Ronny South was second in kick scoring, with 42 extra points and 6 field goals. As an offensive unit, the Hogs had the best scoring offense (32.4 ppg), the eighth-best rushing offense (226.1 ypg), seventh best total offense (360.2 ypg) nationally. The defense was fourth-best against the run (74.9 yards allowed per game).
Game notes.
Cotton Bowl.
The Arkansas Razorbacks put their 22-game win streak on the line in the 1966 Cotton Bowl Classic against their rivals, the Tigers of LSU. Arkansas had the number one scoring offense coming into the game, averaging 32.4 points per contest.
Arkansas took the ball to the end zone on the opening drive, capped by a 19 yard toss from Jon Brittenum to All-American end Bobby Crockett. Running back Joe LaBruzzo then ran in from three yards out for the Bengal Tigers to tie the game at 7. Razorback QB Brittenum then left the game after suffering a shoulder injury and the Hogs fumbled the ball three plays later. LaBruzzo again scored, this time from one yard away, giving the Tigers a 14–7 halftime lead.
Neither team scored in the second half, and Arkansas ended the game on the LSU 24-yard line. Razorback Bobby Crockett set a bowl record with 10 catches for 129 yards.

1969.
Overview.
Bill Burnett scored 20 touchdowns, the third-highest total in the nation. Kicker Bill McClard tied Happy Feller of Texas with 61 points scored, 40 extra points and 7 field goals. As a team, Arkansas had the #1 defense, allowing only 7.6 points per game.
Game of the Century.
With two legendary coaches (Broyles and Royal), two neighboring states, two football powerhouses (8 of last 10 SWC Championships), and two recent National Championships (Arkansas in 1964 and Texas in 1963), Arkansas and Texas had developed a rivalry. The game was moved from the usual third week in October to the first week in December so it could be televised nationally on ABC. President Richard Nixon attended the game, and AstroTurf was even installed in Razorback Stadium in preparation for the game. 
Arkansas' top-rated defense was going up against the #1 rated Texas offense, but the Hogs got on top early, with a 1-yard TD run by Bill Burnett. After halftime, Chuck Dicus hauled in a 29-yard touchdown pass, giving the Razorbacks a 14–0 lead heading into the game's final quarter. Longhorn QB James Street then led his squad to its first touchdown, and as coach Darrell Royal had planned, Texas attempted and completed the two-point conversion, which would in all likelihood prevent a tie. 
Arkansas then had the ball and the lead, and a 73-yard drive later, the Hogs were in good position to tack on a field goal that would put the game out of reach, but Razorback QB Bill Montgomery was intercepted in the end zone, giving Texas new life. The Longhorn drive appeared stalled at their own 43, on a 4th and 3, when Royal gambled again. A 44-yard pass to Randy Peschel, catching the ball in double coverage, put Texas at the Arkansas 13. Longhorn RB Jim Bertelsen would run in for the tying six points. The extra point snap was high, but was snared by third-string QB Donnie Wigginton and the kick was converted by Longhorn kicker Happy Feller, giving Texas a 15–14 lead with 3:58 to play.
Arkansas drove to the Texas 40, looking for a field goal from All-American kicker Bill McClard, but the turnover bug struck again as Montgomery was again picked off.
Sugar Bowl.
Rivals Ole Miss and Arkansas met in the 1970 Sugar Bowl.
Ole Miss RB Bo Bowen scampered 69 yards to open the scoring, with Archie Manning adding another 18-yard TD run. Down 14–0, Arkansas responded with a 12-yard TD run by Bill Burnett, but the extra point was missed, and after a Rebel field goal and Archie Manning 30-yard TD strike, were down 24–6. Before halftime, Chuck Dicus hauled in a 47-yard pass from Bill Montgomery, but the two-point conversion was incomplete, and the Rebels took a 24–12 halftime lead.
The third quarter produced a field goal from each team, and in the fourth quarter fullback Bruce Maxwell caught a six-yard strike from Montgomery to cut the lead to five, but the rally fell short, the Hogs losing by a 27–22 final.

Dunkirk (TV series)

Dunkirk is a 2004 BBC television docudrama about the Battle of Dunkirk and the Dunkirk evacuation in World War II.
Episodes.
Episode one: "Retreat".
Day 1: Captain Bill Tennant, RN, at the Admiralty receives reports of the British Expeditionary Force's retreat and prepares to oversee Operation "Dynamo". Private Alf Tombs and his decimated company rest at Wormhoudt on the western end of the corridor to Dunkirk. New Prime Minister Winston Churchill chairs a briefing of the War Cabinet where Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax presses for peace negotiations. Adolf Hitler has halted the Blitzkrieg, giving Tombs’s company time to consolidate their position and Signalmen Clive Tonry and Wilf Saunders return to offer support.
Day 2: Tennant sails from Dover on to find the Port of Dunkirk decimated by enemy bombardment. Divisions between Churchill and Halifax deepen over the proposed mediation of Italy, threatening a leadership crisis. Embarkation progresses slowly and Tennant signals the "Queen of the Channel" to come alongside the eastern breakwater to speed up the process.
Day 3: Tonry and Saunders intercept enemy orders for a pincer movement on Dunkirk. Tombs’s company is forced to pull back as it comes under fire and Tonry and Saunders head into the front line in a last-ditch attempt to hold open the corridor. After nine hours of fighting, the line breaks as Tombs’s company surrenders to the advancing enemy and Tonry and Saunders retreat to Dunkirk. Tombs narrowly escapes as the rest of his company is massacred but is later recaptured and spends the rest of the war in a POW camp.
Day 4: Tennant orders all vessels to be brought up to the eastern breakwater at once for embarkation as numbers on the beach swell. Churchill decrees that the wounded should be left behind to speed up the retreat. The enemy launch aerial attacks on the beaches from captured British airfields south of Dunkirk, sinking 30 British ships and leaving 400,000 allied troops stranded on the beach.
Episode two: "Evacuation".
Day 5: Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay and Captain Michael Denny at Dover issue the request for more inshore craft. Captain Tom Halsey and navigator David Mellis hold off the coast while small boats ferry troops to her. BEF commander Lord Gort, contemplating his unauthorised order to retreat from a villa overlooking the beach and organises a final defensive perimeter. French Admiral Jean Abriel first learns of the British evacuation from Tennant as French troops swell the numbers on the beach. Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownall reports the problem to Churchill. 
When the cockleboat "Renown" is amongst those small boats requisitioned, Captain Harry Noakes and his crew volunteer to stay on for the mission to France. With a large percentage of the British fleet tied up in the rescue operation, Churchill orders the gassing of Britain’s south coast to ward off invasion. Gort and Tennant argue over the evacuation strategy as the HQ comes under artillery fire. Churchill, refusing to send support to the beleaguered French at the Somme, agrees instead that their troops will be evacuated from Dunkirk on an equal basis.
Day 6: The "Renown" joins the hundreds of small craft that narrowly avoid running aground in order to rescue the troops from the French beaches. HMS "Malcolm" collects her passengers from the eastern breakwater, where she comes under bombardment. Major-General Harold Alexander takes command after Gort is ordered back to London. HMS "Malcolm" returns to Dover where Holsey and Mellis contemplate the friends that they have lost on other ships. The "Renown" safely delivers its passengers to Dover but is destroyed by a mine on its way home. Tonry and Saunders are amongst the two thirds of the BEF evacuated safely back to England but 200,000 allied troops remain on the beach as the perimeter comes under attack from advancing enemy forces.
Episode three: "Deliverance".
Day 6: Lieutenant Jimmy Langley and Major Angus McCorquodale of the Coldstream Guards receive orders to hold the perimeter for one last night. Abriel, learning from Alexander of the imminent British pullout that will leave many French troops still on the beach, threatens to close the port. Philip Newman cares for the wounded left behind at the casualty clearing station in an abandoned château on the outskirts of Dunkirk. Alexander and Tennant promise Abriel one last day to evacuate the French troops.
Day 7: Langley’s company engages the enemy at dawn as an exhausted Newman struggles to get the wounded to safety. Tennant informs Newman of the policy to de-prioritise the wounded and asks him to hold out for one more day. Enemy troops advancing on the perimeter use civilians as a shield and Langley has to rely on rifle fire to hold them back. Holsey and Mellis arrive onboard HMS "Malcolm" on their fifth rescue mission under heavy fire. Newman remains to care for the wounded with a skeleton staff as the rest of the station staff withdraw. As the rearguard pull out, leaving the perimeter to be defended by the French, a badly wounded Langley is abandoned on the beach. 
Day 8: Desmond Thorogood arrives in Dunkirk but must wait until nightfall for rescue. Ramsay meticulously plans the night's operations. When it is over, Tennant sends his last signal from Dunkirk and embarks for home; he gets his first sleep on the train to London. 
Day 9: Newman discovers the abandoned Langley and takes him into the station. The French troops covering the evacuation did not make it out in time so another night’s operations are required to pull them out. HMS "Malcolm" sets out on her ninth mission to Dunkirk.
Day 10: Returning safely to Dover, the "Malcolm"s crew are granted three days leave. The operation is deemed a success, Churchill looks to the skies for what will be the next threat of total war. Dunkirk finally falls to the enemy but the rescued troops of the BEF make up the core of Britain's wartime army.

Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II

Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II (NvNPPII) (Russian Нововоронежская АЭС II []) is a Russian nuclear power plant currently under construction and expected to come online in 2013. It is being built on the same site as the present Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.
History.
In 2006, the Russian government legislated a nuclear expansion plan for 2007–2015. The plan aimed to put two new nuclear reactors into operation each year from 2012. This decision provided impetus for the construction of NNPPII, which had been originally been mooted in 1999. On 20 June 2007 preparations began at the construction site. Construction starting ceremony was held on 12 July 2009.
Description.
The power station will comprise two to four VVER-1200/392M reactors of the AES-2006 type. These reactors are the first of their kind. Unit 1 was planned to be added to the grid in 2012, with the second unit to be added a year later. Cost of the project is between 110 and 130 billion Rubles. The city of Novovoronezh is to provide housing for incoming NvNPP II construction workers. In early 2008 the first two apartment blocks were complete and ready to use.
Construction of the nuclear power plant is important because the existing Novovoronezh nuclear power plant is a focal point of the energy supply system. The power plant complex provides energy not only to Voronezh Oblast but to Belgorod, Lipetsk and Tambov territories as well.

Peter Grubb (mason)

The youngest of the seven sons of John Grubb and his wife Frances of Brandywine Hundred, Peter first learned the stonemasonry trade. In 1729, he built a water corn and boulting mill in Bradford, Pennsylvania. He constructed his first iron bloomery (a crude form of furnace) in 1737 at Furnace Creek, on the modern border of Lancaster and Lebanon counties. 
Grubb constructed a regular iron furnace, known as Hopewell on Hammer Creek near his bloomery. As he started to operate Hopewell, Peter soon located three mountains of magnetic iron ore just west of the furnace. He decided to mine the ore and by 1739 had acquired over that he called Cornwall Iron Mines, in honor of his father's birthplace. In 1742, he opened Cornwall Iron Furnace to take advantage of the discovery. Peter Grubb's Hopewell Forge Mansion, completed around 1740 and later occupied by his son Peter Jr., still stands about six miles (10 km) from Cornwall on present-day Route 322. 
In 1745 Peter decided to relinquish direct control of the ironworks, and he leased the operation to Cury and Company for 20 years at £250 a year. He moved with his wife to Wilmington, Delaware, where he engaged in the buying and selling of real estate and lived out his life.
Legacy.
Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. inherited the ironworks after his death in 1754. They took over operation around 1765, after the lease expired, and quickly expanded the business, later becoming significant providers of munitions to the Revolutionary War effort. Unfortunately, most of the Cornwall ironworks fell out of the Grubb family's hands by 1802. But later generations, starting with Peter Jr.'s son Henry Bates Grubb, built on the remaining holdings with great success. From 1840 to 1870 the Grubbs were among the leading iron manufacturers in Pennsylvania, with Mount Hope Estate serving as their center of operations.
Personal life.
On 2nd mo. 12, 1732 at Caln Meeting, Peter Grubb married Martha Bates (or Bate), widow of James Wall. Martha Bates, a native of Newton Township, New Jersey, was the daughter of Jeremiah Bates and Mary Spicer, and the granddaughter of William Bates, a founder of Newton Colony in 1681. Peter and Martha Grubb had two sons, Curtis Grubb (circa 1733 - 1789) and Peter Grubb, Jr. (1740–1786). After Martha died, Peter remarried on 12th mo. 10, 1741 to Hannah Mendenhall, widow of Thomas Marshall. In 1745, Peter and Hannah Grubb retired to Wilmington, Delaware, where he engaged in the buying and selling of real estate.

Prince Francis Joseph of Braganza

Prince Francis Joseph of Braganza (; 7 September 1879 – 15 June 1919) was a member of the exiled branch of House of Braganza and an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. During his life he was involved in a number incidents ranging from sex scandals to swindles. His full given names were "Francis Joseph Gerard Maria George Humbert Anthony Henry Michael Rafael Gabriel" ().
Early life.
Francis Joseph was born in Meran, Austria (now in Italy), the second son of the Miguelist pretender to the Portuguese throne Miguel, Duke of Braganza and his first wife Princess Elisabeth of Thurn and Taxis. He was the namesake of his godfather Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria. Francis Joseph's father was the head of the non reigning branch of the Portuguese Royal House that had been exiled from Portugal. The exile was the result of the Portuguese law of banishment of 1834 and the constitution of 1838 which was brought about because his grandfather Miguel of Portugal had in 1828 usurped the throne of Portugal from Queen Maria II. His grandfather reigned as king until 1834 when Maria II was restored. Those Portuguese who recognised Francis Joseph's father as rightful king of Portugal acknowledged Francis Joseph as an Infante of Portugal.
Like his father, Francis Joseph pursued a career in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In October 1900, while a lieutenant in the Hussars he was disciplined by his godfather the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph, after he issued a challenge to an old colonel who called him to account for a breach of Army regulations. As a result he was removed from the Hussars and transferred to a regiment of Dragoons and sent to carry out policing duties in the barren, poverty stricken villages along the Austrian-Russian frontier.
Homosexual scandal.
In August 1902 Francis Joseph was in London to attend the coronation of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. On 11 September he was indicted in the Central Criminal Court on a charge that he had committed an act of gross indecency with a fifteen-year old boy. A 24-year old man and a seventeen-year old boy were also charged with conspiring together to procure the commission of an act of gross indecency. A witness claimed that he had made a hole in a bedroom door and that through the hole he had seen Francis Joseph and the fifteen-year old boy engaged in sexual activity in a house in Lambeth. The witness's testimony was contradicted by the police who said that it was only possible to see nine inches of the bed through the hole. The prosecutors announced that they thought that it would not be right for the jury to convict on the evidence produced. The jury pronounced Francis Joseph not guilty.
After the acquittal his lawyer stated that Francis Joseph had gone to the house "under the impression that it was a brothel and that a woman would be waiting for him there. It was not uncommon on the Continent for men and boys to go about touting to take men to brothels." The other man and the two boys were found guilty of conspiring together to procure the commission of an act of gross indecency. The man was sentenced to two years imprisonment, and the boys to ten and eight months each.
As a result of the scandal Francis Joseph was forced to resign his commission as a Lieutenant in the Seventh Hussars of the Austro-Hungarian Army. The Austrian courts reduced his legal status, depriving him of his civic rights and placing the administration of his affairs in the hands of a trustee, his brother-in-law Prince Charles Louis of Thurn und Taxis.
Francis Joseph was later implicated in another homosexual scandal in Austria.
Emerald swindle.
In November 1909 Francis Joseph had £325,000 swindled from him after purchasing what he believed to be valuable emeralds and shares in an English mining company, by an impostor passing himself of as Frederick Vanderbilt of the famous Vanderbilt family. The impostor, whose real name was William Lackerstein Joachim, first met Francis Joseph in Paris in April 1909 and a month later Joachim traveled to Vienna where he threw a dinner for Francis Joseph. Joachim managed to convince Francis Joseph of his credentials as an astute financier. As Francis Joseph's affairs had been placed in the hands of a trustee and he was only given an allowance, he saw a friendship with supposed millionaire member of the Vanderbilt family as a good way to boost his finances. In October after Francis Joseph returned from a trip abroad, he received a number of business proposals where Joachim told him that he had recently acquired a large number of emeralds and that because Francis Joseph had been a good host to him in Vienna, that he would allow him to purchase the emeralds for a good price, whereby he could then sell them for a substantial profit.
The deal was held up after Francis Joseph did not show up for an arranged meeting at a banquet. After an emissary informed Joachim that Francis Joseph's father, the Duke of Braganza, had summoned him to his castle in Seebenstein, Joachim feared that he had been tricked. However, the next day he received a letter from Francis Joseph in which he revealed his annoyance at being unable to attend.
Joachim and Francis Joseph next met in Berlin a week later to conclude the emerald deal. However, during the delay Joachim had come up with a way to swindle more money out of Francis Joseph. While in Berlin, he introduced Francis Joseph to two supposed mining engineers. The two engineers made a good impression on Francis Joseph, so Joachim managed to get him to part with more money by acquiring shares in the mining company that he said he was the majority shareholder of. For the emeralds and shares Prince Francis Joseph paid a total of £325,000, £125,000 for the emeralds and £200,000 for the shares.
As the emeralds and shares turned out to be worthless Francis Joseph decided to prosecute criminally through the Austrian embassy in London. The majority of his money was recovered.
Royalist leader.
In 1911-1912 Francis Joseph participated in the monarchist uprisings in northern Portugal led by Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the First Portuguese Republic. After his father and older brother renounced their rights to the Portuguese throne in an attempt to unite the monarchist support behind the deposed King Manuel II, Prince Francis Joseph was hailed as a leader of the Royalist cause by a number of monarchists and he was seen as a rival to the deposed king in the event of a restoration.
Death.
During World War I Francis Joseph fought in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was captured. He was imprisoned on the island of Ischia near Naples where he died of heart failure.

1972–73 Chicago Black Hawks season

The 1972–73 Chicago Black Hawks season was the Hawks' forty-seventh season in the NHL, and the club was coming off their third consecutive first place finish in 1971-72, as they finished on top of the West Division with a 46-17-15 record, tying a club record with 107 points. The Hawks swept the Pittsburgh Penguins in the NHL quarter-finals before they were swept by the New York Rangers in the semi-finals.
During the off-season, the Black Hawks lost Bobby Hull to the Winnipeg Jets in the newly created World Hockey Association, who signed him to the first $1 million contract in hockey history. The NHL also expanded once again, as the New York Islanders would join the East Division, while the Atlanta Flames would be placed in the West.
Chicago, dealing with the lost of Hull, got off to a quick start of the season, winning their first four games, before sliding into a slump that saw their record fall to 7-7-2. The club would break out of their slump, and win 14 of their next 18 games, and take hold of the top spot in the West Division. The Hawks then cruised to their fourth straight first place finish, as they had a record of 42-27-9, earning 93 points, which was their lowest point total since missing the playoffs in the 1968-69 season.
Offensively, the Black Hawks were led by Jim Pappin, who had a career season, scoring 41 goals and 92 points. Pit Martin also stepped up, earning 61 assists and 90 points, while Dennis Hull scored 39 goals and 90 points. Stan Mikita had a very solid year, earning 83 points despite missing 21 games due to injuries. Bill White lead the defense, registering 47 points, while Pat Stapleton scored 10 goals and 31 points. Rookie Phil Russell had a team high 156 penalty minutes, and had a +31 rating, which tied him with Mikita for the team lead.
In goal, Tony Esposito led the club with 32 victories and a 2.51 GAA, along with four shutouts while appearing in 56 games. Backup goaltender Gary Smith won 10 games while having a 3.54 GAA.
The Hawks opened the playoffs against the St. Louis Blues, who had a record of 32-34-12, earning 76 points, while placing fourth in the West Division. The series opened with two games at Chicago Stadium, and the Black Hawks easily defeated the Blues in the series opener, winning 7-1, before shutting out St. Louis 1-0 in the second game to take an early series lead. The series shifted to the St. Louis Arena for the next two games, however, Chicago took a 3-0 series lead, winning 5-2 in the third game, but the Blues avoided the sweep, winning 5-3 in the fourth game. Chicago returned home for the fifth game, and easily took care of St. Louis, thumping the Blues 6-1 to win the series.
Chicago's next opponent was the New York Rangers, who had finished the season with a 47-23-8 record, earning 102 points, and a third place finish in the East Division. The Rangers defeated the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Boston Bruins in their first playoff series. Since the Black Hawks won their division, they were given home ice advantage in the series. The series opened up with two games at Chicago Stadium, but it was the Rangers who struck first, winning the series opener by a 4-1 score. The Black Hawks rebounded in the second game, holding off New York for a 5-4 victory to even the series. The series moved to Madison Square Garden for the next two games, and it would be the Hawks who took control of the series, defeating the Rangers 2-1 and 3-1 to take a 3-1 series lead back to Chicago for the fifth game. The Black Hawks stayed hot, and easily beat the Rangers 4-1 to win the series and advance to the Stanley Cup finals for the second time in three years.
The Hawks opponent in the 1973 Stanley Cup finals was the Montreal Canadiens, who were the best team in the league during the regular season, as they had a 52-10-16 record, earning 120 points. The Canadiens had defeated the Buffalo Sabres and Philadelphia Flyers to earn a spot in the finals. The series opened at the Montreal Forum, and the powerful Canadiens easily won the first game by an 8-3 score, followed by a 4-1 win in the second game to take a 2-0 series lead. The finals shifted to Chicago Stadium for the next two games, and the Hawks cut into the Canadiens series lead with a 7-4 victory in the third game. Montreal rebounded in the fourth game though, shutting out Chicago 4-0 to take a 3-1 series lead. The fifth game returned to Montreal, however, the Black Hawks stayed alive with a wild 8-7 victory, cutting the Canadiens lead to 3-2 in the series. In the sixth game back in Chicago, Montreal would rebound, defeating the Hawks 6-4 to win the Stanley Cup.

In the Tradition (Dave Van Ronk album)

In the Tradition is a 1964 album by American folksinger Dave Van Ronk and The Red Onion Jazz Band. It is unusual in the fact that the tracks are evenly split between Van Ronk and the Red Onions.
"In the Tradition" is out-of-print but is included in the 2002 Fantasy Records CD reissue "Two Sides of Dave Van Ronk" which also contains most of "Your Basic Dave Van Ronk". Some songs are also included in the Big Beat compilation "Hesitation Blues".
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the album "a little strange for an early Dave Van Ronk LP, with the album split evenly between tracks on which the singer is backed by the Dixieland jazz-style combo the Red Onions and by more customary acoustic folk-blues solo guitar. Both of those styles were part of his persona, though it's the more somber acoustic folk-blues that stand out more. It's a reasonably strong album, not too much different from much of the rest of his catalog, other than in the balanced mixture between jazz and folk approaches."

Cần Vương movement

The Cần Vương (Hán tự: 勤王, lit. "Aid the King") movement was a large-scale Vietnamese insurgency between 1885 and 1889 against French colonial rule. Its objective was to expel the French and install the boy emperor Hàm Nghi as the leader of an independent Vietnam. The movement lacked a coherent national structure, and consisted mainly of regional leaders who attacked French troops in their own provinces. The movement initially prospered, as there were only a few French garrisons in Annam, but failed after the French recovered from the surprise of the insurgency and poured troops into Annam from bases in Tonkin and Cochinchina. The insurrection in Annam spread and flourished in 1886, reached its climax the following year and gradually faded out by 1889.
Background.
The August 1883 Treaty of Huế, forced upon the Vietnamese court at Huế by the French in the wake of their victory at the Thuận An (20 August 1883), imposed a French protectorate on both Annam and Tonkin. Many Vietnamese were anxious to shake off the French protectorate, and opposition to French rule gradually increased during the next two years. Plans for an insurgency took shape while the French in Tonkin were distracted by the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). Matters came to a head in June 1885, when France and China signed the Treaty of Tientsin, in which China implicitly renounced its historic claims to suzerainty over Vietnam. 
The 'Huế ambush', July 1885.
The Cần Vương movement was launched in July 1885, when General Roussel de Courcy and an escort of French troops of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps were the victims of a sudden, premeditated night attack by thousands of Vietnamese insurgents during a ceremonial visit to Huế on 2 July. De Courcy rallied his men, and both his own command and other groups of French troops cantoned on both sides of the citadel of Huế were able to beat off the attacks on their positions. Later, under the leadership of "chef de bataillon" Metzinger, the French mounted a successful counterattack from the west, fighting their way through the gardens of the citadel and capturing the royal palace. By daybreak the isolated French forces had linked up, and were in full control of the citadel. Angered by what they saw as Vietnamese treachery, they looted the royal palace. Following the failure of the 'Huế ambush', as it was immediately dubbed by the French, the young Vietnamese king Hàm Nghi and other members of the Vietnamese imperial family fled from Huế and took refuge in a mountainous military base in Tan So. The regent Tôn Thất Thuyết, who had helped Hàm Nghi escape from Huế, persuaded Hàm Nghi to issue an edict calling for the people to rise up and "aid the king" ("can vuong"). Thousands of Vietnamese patriots responded to this appeal in Annam itself, and it undoubtedly also strengthened indigenous resistance to French rule in neighbouring Tonkin, much of which had been brought under French control during the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885).
Attacks on Vietnamese Christians.
The Cần Vương movement was aimed at the French, but although there were more than 35,000 French soldiers in Tonkin and thousands more in the French colony of Cochinchina, the French had only a few hundred soldiers in Annam, dispersed around the citadels of Huế, Thuận An, Vinh and Qui Nhơn. With hardly any French troops to attack, the insurgents directed their anger instead against Vietnamese Christians, long regarded as potential allies of the French. Although the numbers remain disputed, it seems likely that between the end of July and the end of September 1885 Cần Vương fighters killed around 40,000 Vietnamese Christians, wiping out nearly a third of Vietnam's Christian population. The two worst massacres took place in the towns of Quảng Ngãi and Bình Định, both south of Huế, in which some 24,000 men, women and children, from a total Christian population of 40,000 were killed. A further 7,500 Christians were killed in Quảng Trị province. In other provinces the number of victims was considerably lower. In many areas the Christians fought back under the leadership of French and Spanish priests, in response to a call from their bishops to defend themselves with every means at their disposal. Outnumbered and on the defensive, the Christians were nevertheless able to inflict a number of local defeats on Cần Vương formations.
French military intervention from Tonkin.
The French were slow to respond to the Cần Vương, and for several weeks did not believe the gruesome rumours emanating from Annam. Eventually the scale of the massacres of Christians became clear, and the French belatedly responded. Incursions into Annam were made by troops of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, which had been reinforced in June 1885 to 35,000 men. Initially forbidden by the French government to launch a full-scale invasion of Annam, General de Courcy landed troops along the vulnerable coastline of central Vietnam to seize a number of strategic points and to protect the embattled Vietnamese Christian communities in the wake of the massacres at Quảng Ngãi and Bình Định. In early August 1885 Lieutenant-Colonel Chaumont led a battalion of marine infantry on a march through the provinces of Hà Tĩnh and Nghệ An to occupy the citadel of Vinh.
In southern Annam, 7000 Christian survivors of the Bình Định massacre took refuge in the small French concession in Qui Nhơn. In late August 1885 a column of 600 French and Tonkinese soldiers under the command of General Léon Prud'homme sailed from Huế aboard the warships "La Cocheterie", "Brandon", "Lutin" and "Comète", and landed at Qui Nhơn. After raising the siege Prud'homme marched on Bình Định. On 1 September, Vietnamese insurgents attempted to block his advance. Armed only with lances and antiquated firearms and deployed in unwieldy masses which made perfect targets for the French artillery, the Cần Vương fighters were no match for Prud'homme's veterans. They were swept aside, and on 3 September the French entered Bình Định. Three Vietnamese mandarins were tried and executed for complicity in the massacre of Bình Định's Christians. In November 1885 a so-called 'Annam column' under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Mignot set off from Ninh Binh in southern Tonkin and marched down the narrow spine of Vietnam as far as Huế, scattering any insurgent bands in its way.
French political response.
The French responded politically to the uprising by pressing ahead with arrangements for entrenching their protectorate in both Annam and Tonkin. They were helped by the fact that there was by no means unanimous support for the Cần Vương movement. The queen mother, Từ Dũ, and other members of the Vietnamese royal family deserted Hàm Nghi and returned to Huế shortly after the uprising began. In September 1885, to undercut support for Hàm Nghi, General de Courcy enthroned the young king's brother Đồng Khánh in his stead. Although many Vietnamese regarded Đồng Khánh as a French puppet king, not all did. One of the most important Vietnamese leaders, Prince Hoàng Kế Viêm, who had been fighting the French for several years in Tonkin, gave his allegiance to Đồng Khánh. 
Siege of Ba Đình, January 1887.
The Siege of Ba Đình (December 1886 to January 1887) in Thanh Hóa province was a decisive engagement between the insurgents and the French. The siege was deliberately willed by the Vietnamese resistance leader Dinh Cong Trang, who built an enormous fortified camp near the Tonkin-Annam border, crammed it full of Annamese and Tonkinese insurgents, and dared the French to attack him there. The French obliged, and after a two-month siege in which the defenders were exposed to relentless bombardment by French artillery, the surviving insurgents were forced to break out of Ba Đình on 20 January 1887. The French entered the abandoned Vietnamese stronghold the following day. Their total casualties during the siege amounted to only 19 dead and 45 wounded, while Vietnamese casualties ran into thousands. The Vietnamese defeat at Ba Đình highlighted the disunity of the Cần Vương movement. Trang gambled that his fellow resistance leaders would harass the French lines from the rear while he held them from the front, but little help reached him.
Intervention from Cochinchina.
The catastrophe at Bình Định broke the power of the Cần Vương in northern Annam and Tonkin. The first half of 1887 also saw the collapse of the movement in the southern provinces of Quang Nam, Quảng Ngãi, Bình Định and Phú Yên. For several months after Prud'homme's brief campaign in September 1885 around Qui Nhơn and Bình Định, the Cần Vương fighters in the south had hardly seen a Frenchman. The Tonkin Expeditionary Corps was fully committed in Tonkin and northern Annam, while French troops in Cochinchina were busy dealing with an insurrection against the French protectorate in neighbouring Cambodia. In the early months of 1886 the insurgents took advantage of French weakness in the south to extend their influence into Khánh Hòa and Bình Thuận, the southernmost provinces of Annam. Cần Vương forces were now uncomfortably close to the French posts in Cochinchina, and the French authorities in Saigon at last responded. In July 1886 the French struck back in the south. A 400-man 'column of intervention' was formed in Cochinchina, consisting of French troops and a force of Vietnamese partisans under the command of Trần Bá Lộc. The column landed at Phan Ry, on the coast of Bình Thuận. By September 1886 had won control of the province. In the following spring the French moved into Bình Định and Phú Yên provinces. One of the Cần Vương leaders went over to the French side, and the resistance soon collapsed. By June 1887 the French had established control over the Annamese provinces to the south of Huế. More than 1,500 Cần Vương insurgents laid down their arms, and brutal reprisals, orchestrated by Tran Ba Loc, were taken against their leaders.
Capture of Hàm Nghi, 1888.
In 1888, Hàm Nghi was captured and deported to Algeria and the Cần Vương movement was effectively ended, although most of his supporters continued to fight on until they were killed, captured or executed. Revolutionary guerrilla attacks continued for years until the death of Phan Dinh Phung in 1896.

Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety

The Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety is a law enforcement entity consisting of sworn peace officers who have taken an oath to serve and protect both the Auburn Main Campus located in Cayuga County, NY, and the Fulton Branch Campus located in Oswego County, NY. The Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety operates two main sections of service: campus police patrol operations and safety operations.
Currently, the Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety consists of a Director of Public Safety/Chief Public Safety Officer, Patrol Supervisor/Sergeant, and 15 part-time Public Safety Officer who also hold positions as police officers in several area municipalities. All members of the Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety have exceeded the State University of New York (SUNY) Peace Officer Training standards by attending a full police academy.
History.
Prior to 2005, Auburn City Police Officers provided campus police services under the color of the Auburn City Police Department. In 2005, Cayuga County Civil Service required the college to hire Public Safety Officers through the Civil Service process, which requires a written test, and successful completion of the Police Academy. The College Board of Trustees decided to exercise their right under New York State Criminal Procedure Law Article 2.10 Subsection 78 and install peace officers. The city police officers were allowed to lateral into the part-time positions, the Chief who also worked for an area police department was granted peace officer status, and the full-time Sergeant was subsequently sent to the police academy and granted peace officer status.
The present day Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety was born.
Training.
Though state regulation only requires SUNY Community College Peace Officers to attend approximately 400 hours of training, Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety requires their Public Safety Officers to attend a full 800+ hour police academy. This means that these peace officers are trained as equally as their municipal police officer counterparts.
Equipment.
All Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety officers are armed with Glock .40 caliber semi-automatic pistols, batons, pepper spray, and handcuffs. There are potential future plans for training and equipping the officers with tasers. The president of all SUNY Community Colleges determine whether or not officers on their campus will carry firearms. Cayuga Community College's President has decided to allow such tools to be carried.
Power and Authority.
Cayuga Community College Public Safety Officers are designated as New York State peace officers in accordance with Article 2.10 Subsection 78, of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law. As New York State peace officers, these officers are fully sworn and commissioned by the State of New York to enforce the laws of New York State in their jurisdiction, which lies on the two campuses of the college, all other college property, and the adjoining roadways between campuses and/or other college property. Article 140 of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law explains the arrest authority of Police and Peace Officers in and outside their geographical area of employment. Public Safety officers may act on warrants that come to their attention, but applying for and executing search warrants on the two college campuses, other college property, and the adjoining roadways is the jurisdiction of the respective local municipal police agency. Other powers include warrantless arrests, the use of deadly physical force, and issuing tickets and court summonses.
Relationship with Municipal Police Agencies.
Cayuga Community College Office of Public Safety shares an excellent professional relationship with the Auburn City Police Department, Fulton City Police Department, Cayuga County Sheriff's Office, Oswego County Sheriff's Department, and the New York State Police.

Rockingham railway station

Rockingham railway station was a station just south of Caldecott, Rutland. The station was actually over the county line into Leicestershire, and was named after the village of Rockingham, Northamptonshire, which although one mile distant and smaller than Caldecott was thought to be more important because it is the location of Rockingham Castle.
The station opened in 1850 as part of the single track Rugby and Stamford Railway line of the London and North Western Railway (although it actually joined the Midland Railway at Luffenham), but in 1873 the line was doubled and became part of a new Rugby to Peterborough East route.
The Great Northern Railway also provided trains between 1880 and 1916.
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
February 2014: In very private ownership, the station house is visible from the road just south of Caldecott. So, is the delapidated wooden platform shelter (though this does not look like it will survive for much longer!). The old coal shed is still standing and in remarkable condition. The pub opposite has some interesting old photographs of the station in it's heyday.

<doc id="18336612" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18336612" title="DePauw University Delta Zeta discrimination controversy">
DePauw University Delta Zeta discrimination controversy

The DePauw University Delta Zeta discrimination controversy occurred at the end of 2006 when the Delta Zeta national leadership was criticized after the "New York Times" published an article accusing the sorority of deactivating certain members of the Delta Chapter at DePauw University based on their perceived attractiveness. The controversy made national headlines and resulted in the chapter's closing and various legal actions.
Background.
Founded in 1909, the Delta chapter was the sorority's second oldest active chapter and its fourth oldest chapter overall. Despite its long history at DePauw, however, the Delta chapter in recent years had struggled with declining membership and acquired a negative reputation on campus.
In August 2006, national representatives, concerned about the Delta chapter's inability to recruit new members, announced that the chapter would be closed at the end of the 2006–7 school year if they failed to increase their numbers substantially or elected not to participate in active recruitment or informal rush. At a school where an estimated 70% of the student body belongs to a fraternity or sorority, the ΔΖ house was two-thirds empty. According to some former members, the chapter was known on campus as "The Dog House," and a DePauw psychology professor's survey of students found that ΔΖ was considered "socially awkward." The sorority attracted "brainy women", many with science and math majors, along with the gifted disabled. Many current members felt that it might be in their best interest to let the chapter close without recruiting new members. In anticipation of Delta's 2009 centennial, ΔΖ Executive Director Cynthia Winslow Menges had originally planned to close the chapter temporarily. In September 2006, however, the university informed ΔΖ headquarters that if the chapter were closed, it would not be allowed to reopen on the sorority's chosen timetable.
Membership review.
In an emergency attempt to salvage the chapter, a team of national representatives came to the university in November 2006 to conduct a membership review, interviewing women individually about their dedication to the sorority. (Delta Zeta representatives have repeatedly asserted that they undertook the review on the advice of the university, whereas DePauw officials "vehemently" deny this.) A few days after the interview process, the national team with women from ΔΖ's Epsilon Chapter at nearby Indiana University held a recruiting event in the house, where some allege 25 of the chapter members were asked not to participate and to remain out of sight. A February 25, 2007, "New York Times" article quoted one former Delta Chapter member as saying, "They had these unassuming freshman girls downstairs with these plastic women from Indiana University, and 25 of my sisters hiding upstairs. It was so fake, so completely dehumanized."
Subsequently, 23 out of 35 active members, including Delta's president, were assigned early alumna status and asked to vacate the house. (Four members had resigned in September after the review was announced, and three others who were living off-campus at the time have claimed they were never contacted about their membership status.) Former members later told university officials that when they first learned of the review, they were led to believe that they would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to continue their involvement in the sorority, but in early December 2006—shortly before finals week at DePauw—national headquarters sent out letters informing members that they were either still active or had been recommended for alumnae status and were to move out of the house by the end of January 2007. Each new alumna received $300 to cover the difference between sorority housing and campus housing; nonetheless, many of the women were unsure that they would find another place to live. The university eventually found housing for the evicted women.
Effects.
In the months following the review, reports began appearing on the Internet alleging that the evicted women had been threatened with expulsion if they refused to take alumnae status, and accusing the national team of choosing which women got to stay active according to their perceived attractiveness. In response to growing criticism from DePauw students and administrators, Delta Zeta representatives stated that the women who had been asked to leave lacked commitment to the chapter's future, but according to the "New York Times" report, the 23 evicted members included all of the overweight women in the chapter, as well as 3 of the 4 minorities; conversely, the 12 women invited to stay "were slender and popular with fraternity men," but eventually half of that group also resigned as a show of solidarity. In the days following the "NYT" article, other national media outlets picked up the story, including CNN, CBS News, "Good Morning America," MSNBC, "Newsweek," and "People". On February 19, 2007, DePauw President Robert Bottoms formally reprimanded Delta Zeta's national headquarters for its actions and instituted a new rule requiring that all housed fraternities and sororities at the university provide housing for their members throughout the school year, except when risk-management violations or behavioral problems make eviction necessary.
During a February 26 interview with Paula Zahn of CNN, Menges denied the chapter's allegations of discrimination based on religion, race, or ethnicity and maintained that the 23 affected women left voluntarily. She also justified the reorganization on the grounds that the chapter had voted to close anyway and that DePauw officials would not guarantee ΔΖ an opportunity to return in the near future. Asked whether appearance had played a part in the evictions, Menges did not directly respond.
On March 1, 2007, Delta Zeta headquarters announced that it would no longer respond to media inquiries about the DePauw chapter. As of March 6, the sorority's national Web site features an apology to the evicted students but still includes a letter calling into question those women's loyalty to the chapter and blaming them in part for its recent struggles.
On March 12, 2007, Bottoms withdrew Delta Zeta's status as a recognized campus organization, stating that the national organization's values, as demonstrated by the evictions, are not compatible with the university's. The sorority was required to leave DePauw following the conclusion of the 2006–2007 academic year. Delta Zeta responded with a statement on the front page of its Web site expressing disappointment with Bottoms's decision and reiterating its position that the review was necessary, but conceding that the 23 alumnae should probably have been notified of their change in status in person and at a different point in the school year. Bottoms characterized the "New York Times" story as inaccurate and a misrepresentation of the school.
Meanwhile, 10 Delta Chapter alumnae have formed a college-sanctioned student organization, Psi Lambda Xi, with the goal of becoming a new sorority. A founder said, "The founding purpose of the sorority is to promote a positive self-image in each other, the University and the community."
Legal actions.
On March 29, 2007, it was reported in the "New York Times" that Delta Zeta's national office, based in Oxford, Ohio, had filed suit in U.S. Federal District Court in Indianapolis against DePauw University for expelling the sorority from campus. The university said the lawsuit completely lacks merit. "From the beginning, DePauw University has acted to protect its students." In November, 2007, Delta Zeta withdrew the lawsuit and DePauw agreed that the sorority will have the opportunity to compete with other sororities attempting to colonize a chapter on the campus beginning in academic year 2010/11 however Delta Zeta elected not to compete for the 2010/2011 academic year and as of May 2010 has no future plans to do so.
Meanwhile, eight former members hired an attorney seeking an apology and other corrective actions from Delta Zeta's national office. If negotiations fail, they will consider filing a lawsuit.
In 1999, eight former members of the sorority's Alpha Theta Chapter at the University of Kentucky sued the national organization, claiming they had been forced to take early alumnae status based on their appearance during a similar reorganization. ΔΖ settled the lawsuit in 2001. The attorney who represented the women from Kentucky called the sorority's actions toward the DePauw chapter "egregious".
Student response.
DePauw University.
In response to the controversy, Delta's six remaining active members issued a statement alleging that their chapter had been misrepresented in the original "New York Times" article. They claimed that one of their current members had offered an opposing viewpoint to Sam Dillon, the reporter who wrote the story, but that her comments were not used. They went on to deny the allegations that "race, weight, and academic majors were used as criteria in the membership review process".
Concern was expressed by other students that at a meeting held February 2, 2007, an educational leadership consultant from Delta Zeta national stated, "Image, I'm not going to lie to you, is a huge part of it."
Since the reorganization and before the national publicity, 8 of 11 freshman women who received invitations to join Delta Zeta during formal recruitment chose not to become members. One said, "We all got together and talked about it and tried to have an open mind. But all of us were really against what they did, and we didn't want to be associated with it."
Texas Christian University.
Texas Christian University selected Gamma Phi Beta International Sorority over Delta Zeta as a new member of its Panhellenic community on February 28, 2007. "It will be a concern because if you bring on a sorority with nationwide conflict," said the Panhellenic director of recruitment, "that's taking a big liability." The Panhellenic president stated that the recent events at DePauw were a factor in the decision.

Charles Grimes Bridge

The Charles Grimes Bridge is a twin road bridge that carries the Docklands Highway over the Yarra River in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was named after New South Wales surveyor general Charles Grimes, who was the first European to see the Yarra River.
As originally constructed in the 1975 it ran north - south over the river, connecting Footscray Road to the West Gate Freeway and Montague Street. The low height of the bridge above the water resulted in the closure of a number of the river wharves on the upstream side. However with the Melbourne Docklands redevelopment of the 1990s, Footscray Road was closed as a through route and rebuilt as Harbour Esplanade. To replace the through route, Wurundjeri Way was constructed to the east. To connect to this new road Flinders Street was upgraded, and the north end of the Charles Grimes Bridge was rebuilt on a curve to connect to 
it. Reconstruction started in June 1999, and was completed by 2001.
The bridge superstructure consists of five 33.5m long main spans over the river, with five smaller spans between 12m and 24m in length over the existing wharf and riverbank. Each of the bridges carries four traffic lanes in one direction, and a footpath. Computer analysis was required during design due to the complex geometry of the spans.

Hymns (band)

Hymns is an indie rock band based in Brooklyn, NY. Originally consisting of North Carolina natives Brian Harding (vocals, guitar) and Jason Roberts (guitar, wurlitzer), the band picked up Texas-based rockers Tony Kent (drums) and Matt Shaw (bass guitar) upon arriving in NYC. Since debuting with the "infectious" "Brother/Sister" the Hymns have been steadily gaining in popularity, appearing with such headliners as Ben Kweller, Hot Hot Heat, Beck, and the Sam Roberts Band. In 2008, the band released their second album, "Travel in Herds," on the Blackland Records label. "Spin Magazine" named them as one of the artists to watch in 2008.
Background Information.
The band is a result of a lifelong friendship between Brian Harding and Jason Roberts, who formed it while attending Appalachian State University. Following their graduation, the power-duo temporarily disbanded, with Roberts joining the Ben Kweller band while Brian relocated to New York City. During Roberts' stint with Ben Kweller, the lead guitarist met and became close with band-member John Kent, who went on to form Blackland Records located in Celeste, TX. After hearing some of the band's work, John quickly signed the band in 2005, along with Roberts, who quit his day job to jump back on board.
During recording sessions at "The Vault" (Blackland Records), the band met up with Matt Shaw and Tony Kent, two local musicians who shared the band's common background of being childhood friends. With the addition to the band, Brian and Jason's dream had finally become a reality, and the group quickly started the recording process, releasing their debut album "Brother/Sister" in the Fall of 2006. This record release generated national attention with publications such as "Spin Magazine", "The New Yorker", and MTV News started taking notice. With their newly acquired popularity, the band appeared with popular artists, including Ben Kweller, the Redwalls, and Butch Walker.
Amidst national tours, the band returned to the studio in 2007 to record their second album, "Travel in Herds", which was released in the spring of 2008.
During SXSW 2009, Hymns hired Nick Stewart as UK Management. They released new tracks, via the Appaloosa EP, on July 21, 2009. Joey McClellan and Austin Schumacher join the band for this third installment of addicting sounds.

Australian Schoolboys rugby league team

The Australian Schoolboys rugby league team is the national rugby league football team for secondary school students in Australia.
The team competes against counterparts in New Zealand, known as the Junior Kiwis, England, Wales and France amongst others. Started in 1972, the Australian Schoolboys have produced over 50 Australian representatives, amongst a host of players who have represented other nations at the highest level.
History.
Early years.
Established in 1972, the first Australian Schoolboys rugby league team featured players from New South Wales and one Western Australian player. The team did not include any Queensland players as they did not send players to the trials. Unlike current day Schoolboys, the team was an Under 16 years age division. Coached by future Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the 20th Century coach, Roy Masters, and featuring future internationals Ian Schubert, Craig Young, Les Boyd and Royce Ayliffe, the side toured Great Britain, going undefeated on the tour and scoring 108 tries in their 11 games to their opponents one. This would be the last Schoolboys team until 1978.
In 1978, the first official Australian Schoolboys Championships were held, but NSW Combined Catholic Colleges did not attend. For the first time Queensland based high school players trialled and a merit team was selected. The first of four Schoolboys merit teams, a merit team is chosen based on the trial games but does not tour or play games together.
The Schoolboys returned to touring with the 1979 team, that featured future Australian internationals Ben Elias and Andrew Farrar. The team toured France and England and went undefeated.
1980s.
The first Schoolboys side of the 80's was selected in 1981, when the Schoolboys hosted the touring Junior Kiwis side from New Zealand. They played two games with the Schoolboys winning both. It was the first time the Schoolboys hosted a tour and played a New Zealand side.
In 1982, the Schoolboys returned the favour and toured New Zealand for the first time, where they also received their first ever loss, to an Auckland based selection team, 16–10. The team was captained by future Australian international Paul Langmack and featured another future international in Andrew Ettingshausen. Another merit team was selected in 1983 and once again featured Ettingshausen. Future internationals Greg Alexander and Paul Sironen and future first grade regulars, Tony Butterfield and Jeff Hardy, were also a part of the side.
In 1984, the Schoolboys hosted a tour by the British Upper Schools and Colleges (BUSCARLA), winning both matches against the tourists. The 1984 Australian Schoolboys was also the first to feature a player who would go on to represent a country other than Australia at international level. Theo Anast from Armidale High School would later play six games for France between 1993 and 1994.
The team selected in 1985 went undefeated against a touring Junior Kiwis side and in 1986 went undefeated once again on their tour of England. The 1986 side featured future Australian internationals Bradley Clyde and Andrew Gee. In 1987, anther merit side was selected, which featured Clyde for the second time.
In 1988, the side toured New Zealand and featured Tim Brasher, David Fairleigh and a 16-year old Brad Fittler. The team went undefeated. Fittler was named again in 1989, as the Schoolboys hosted the British Amateur Rugby League under 19's (BARLA) for two games, winning both.
1990s.
The 1990 Schoolboys side was originally a merit team, but played a one off game against the Australian Youth Development Squad, which they won 38–6. The 1991 team, once again, went undefeated on their tour of England.
In 1992, with a side featuring future premiership winner and Australian international Steve Menzies, the side toured New Zealand. On the tour, the Schoolboys lost their first ever Test match to a New Zealand side featuring future Kiwis Gene Ngamu, Joe Vagana and Ruben Wiki.
The 1993 Australian Schoolboys hosted BARLA and played two tests, winning both. Future NSW State of Origin player and world champion boxer Anthony Mundine was in the team.
In 1994, the Schoolboys hosted, and defeated, the touring Junior Kiwis. This marked the first appearance of a then 15-year old Owen Craigie, who would represent the Schoolboys a record three times in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Future Australian internationals Brett Kimmorley, Ben Ikin and Luke Priddis were also in the side.
The 1995 Schoolboys toured France and England and went undefeated. The side featured future Australian internationals Trent Barrett and Matthew Gidley and World Cup winning New Zealand captain Nathan Cayless. 1995 also saw the first ever Northern Territory schoolboy in Duncan MacGillivray. MacGillivary would later represent Scotland at the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.
Due to the ARL and Super League war in 1996, the Schoolboys (who were supposed to tour New Zealand) toured Papua New Guinea for the first time. They went undefeated in their four matches. The team was coached by 1972 Australian Schoolboys representative Brian Hetherington. The team also featured Ben Rauter, whose father Herb also represented the Australian Schoolboys in 1972.

Magsat

Magsat (Magnetic Field Satellite, Explorer 61, Applications Explorer Mission-3 or AEM-3) spacecraft was launched in the fall of 1979 and ended in the spring of 1980. The mission was to map the Earth's magnetic field, the satellite has two magnetometers. The scalar (Cesium vapor) and vector (fluxgate) magnetometers gave Magsat a capability beyond that of any previous spacecraft. Extended by a telescoping boom, the magnetometers were distanced from the magnetic field created by the satellite and its electronics. The satellite carried two magnetometers, a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer for determining the strength and direction of magnetic fields, and an ion-vapor/vector magnetometer for determining the magnetic field caused by the vector magnetometer itself. 
MAGSAT is considered to be one of the more important Science/Earth orbiting satellites launched; the data it accumulated is still being used, particularly in linking new satellite data to past observations.
After launch the payload was brought to an orbit of 96.8° facing the sun as the earth rotated underneath. It was kept in a close earth orbit, with vector magnetometers capable of sensing magnetic fields closer to Earth's surface. The data collected by this satellite allowed a 3D-mapping of the Earth's magnetic interior as never seen before. In combination with a later satellite, Ørsted, it has been an essential component for explaining the current declining state of the Earth's magnetic field.
History.
On October 30, 1979 Magsat was launched from pad SLC-5 at Vandenberg AFB in California on a Scout II (101) rocket bearing 97° in a dusk to dawn orbit. The spacecraft was placed in an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of . After reaching orbit, its telescoping boom was extended outward by . Two star cameras were used to define the position of the spacecraft relative to Earth. The orbit allowed the satellite to map a majority of the Earth's surfaces except the geographic poles. The satellite decayed from orbit on June 11, 1980.
Critique.
Magsat was not without problems. One of the biggest is that the motion of a metallic object tends to create a magnetic field. One study after the mission found a nonlinear fluxgate response when exposed to fields greater than 5000 mT. The applied field had to be transverse to the axis of the magnetometer. The design was improved by creating a feedback relay over a spherical design. This was the design used on later spacecraft (satellite).

London Town (Bucks Fizz song)

"London Town" is a 1983 single by UK pop group Bucks Fizz. It was their first single not to reach the UK top 20, breaking a run of nine consecutive top 20 hits. The song was written and produced by Andy Hill.
Overview.
Released in September 1983, this was the group's tenth single. The song became their first single to peak outside the top twenty after nine consecutive top 20 hits. Eventually reaching No.34, the song remained on the chart for six weeks. It fared better in other countries however, such as Poland where it reached No.6, Austria: No.19 and Ireland: No.24.
Written by Andy Hill, the lyrics tell of someone who is finding it difficult to adjust to life in a big city but is determined to stay. Lead vocals on the track are by member Bobby G, although he was unhappy with the way his vocals were mixed, giving them a distorted quality, claiming that he "sounded like a munchkin". This single was a short-notice replacement for another song, "Invisible", which featured lead vocals by Jay Aston, but was withdrawn for reasons which are unclear. Details of its release had already been announced to the fan club and mentioned on radio. The song was eventually released on the 12" version of "I Hear Talk" over a year later. The B-side of the single featured a track written by Bucks Fizz themselves, called "Identity". This track featured Mike Nolan on lead vocals and was produced by Bobby G. The 12" single featured an extended remix of "London Town". 
The Promotional Video features the group performing the track with backing dancers in a variety of indoor locations including a Tube station. Part of the video was filmed in Holloway Sanitorium, a disused mental hospital in London. A scene featuring member Jay Aston being attacked by a man (played by her real-life brother, Lance) was cut from the finished version. The single received an unfavourable review in "Smash Hits" (reviewed by comedian Lenny Henry), who said that although he liked their previous singles, this was lacking a melody and was overproduced (to which the magazine added "(understatement!)"). He did however compliment the drum sound on the track.
The song featured on the group's first "Greatest Hits" album, released soon after. It was also released on "The Ultimate Anthology" (2005) with a revised ending.

Havre de Grace Racetrack

The Havre de Grace Racetrack was an American horse racing track on Post Road in Havre de Grace, Harford County, Maryland which operated from August 24, 1912 to 1950. Nicknamed "The Graw," for a time it was owned by the Harford Agricultural and Breeders Association and also by the notorious gambler, Arnold Rothstein.
On September 29, 1920, Man o' War won the Potomac Handicap at Havre de Grace. His son, U.S. Triple Crown winner, War Admiral, won his first race here on April 25, 1936. The Havre de Grace Handicap was one of the important races in the American northeast for many years whose winners include U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductees Roamer, Crusader, Seabiscuit, Sun Beau, Equipoise, and Challedon. As well, some Hall of Fame horses lost this race. In the 1919 running, Cudgel beat two Hall of Famers in the form of Exterminator and Triple Crown champion, Sir Barton.
Located halfway between the cities of Philadelphia and Washington, D.C, in the 1940s the Havre de Grace Racetrack faced increased competition from Delaware Park Racetrack and Garden State Park Racetrack in New Jersey. The racetrack began losing customers and by 1949 its owners were forced to turn over some of their allotted racing days to Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course. In January 1951 the Havre de Grace Racetrack was sold to Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, owner of Pimlico Race Course, and Morris Schapiro of Laurel Park Racecourse who closed the facility and transferred the track's racing allotment dates to their own tracks.
Selected major races held at Havre de Grace Racetrack:
The Havre de Grace Racetrack is now the property of the Maryland National Guard who use the former clubhouse as their offices. The grandstand, minus the canopy, has been converted into a warehouse. Although nothing of the actual track remains, an aerial view reveals a curved line of trees, indicative of the final turn.
Havre de Grace Racetrack in popular culture.
The Havre de Grace Racetrack is among several racetracks which are used as part of the ruse in the motion picture, "The Sting". In the climactic scene, when Doyle Lonnegan enters the parlor to make the final bet, J. J. Singleton can be heard reporting, "At Havre de Grace, the winner, Light Chatter paid 5.40, 2.80, and 2.40..."

Julian Grant

Julian Grant (born 3 October 1960) is an English-born classical composer best known for a series of operas. He is also known for chamber music works and his challenging children's music. He is active as composer, journalist, broadcaster and music educator.
Biography.
Julian Grant was born in London, England, and educated at Chichester High School for Boys and Bristol University. In 1985 he won a British Arts Council scholarship to attend the Music Theatre Studio Ensemble at Banff, Alberta, Canada. He returned to England in 1987 and freelanced for, among others, Northern Ballet Theatre, working closely with Christopher Gable on new performing versions of Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet", and Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake", "Chester Music, Novello's" (a reduction of Thea Musgrave's "Harriet Tubman, a Woman called Moses") and extensive education work with the London opera houses, notably English National Opera's Russian Tour in 1990.
In 1996 he moved with his partner Peter Lighte to Hong Kong, where they adopted two daughters. Grant held posts at Hong Kong University, guest conducted for the Academy of Performing Arts and hosted a weekday classical radio show. He lived in Japan from 2000-2002.
On return to London he became Music Director of St Paul's Girls' School, (2002-7) a post previously held by Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Herbert Howells. During his tenure there he wrote pieces for the school, including a multi-media celebration of the school's centenary in 2004. He worked for the Birmingham and Scottish Operas (reductions of Beethoven's "Fidelio" and Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin"), and wrote articles for the musical press, notably on opera and Russian music. From 2007-2010 he divided his time between Beijing and London, and is now composer-in-residence at St. Ann's School, Brooklyn, New York. In July 2012 his opera-ballet Hot House, a commission for London's Cultural Olympiad, premiered at the Royal Opera House, London.
Works.
While at Banff, Grant produced several small-scale operas that culminated in "The Skin Drum", which won the 1988 National Opera Association of America's biennial chamber opera competition, resulting in a semi-staged performance to launch the English National Opera's Contemporary Opera Studio in 1990. This led to a collaboration with Marina Warner, " The Queen of Sheba's Legs" (ENO Baylis) and to "Out of Season" (Royal Opera House Garden Venture, 1991 - nominated for an Olivier Award). Further works for the opera stage include "A Family Affair", a version of an Alexander Ostrovsky play by Nick Dear (Almeida Theatre, 1993), "Jump Into My Sack" with Meredith Oakes (Mecklenbergh Opera 1996), "Heroes Don’t Dance" (Royal Opera), "Platform 10" and "Odd Numbers" (Tête-à-Tête Opera), " A Very Private Beach" (English National Opera Knack 2004) and "Shadowtracks" (W11 opera, 2007) with regular collaborator Christina Jones. "Odysseus Unwound" (2006 ), also with Tête-à-Tête, involved traditional knitters, spinners and weavers from Fair Isle and Shetland, the conception of which was featured on BBC television's "Culture Show".
He has also written chamber music, instrumental music, orchestral and vocal works, many of which feature his interest and knowledge of Asian music and culture. Recent works include a song-cycle for soprano Sarah Leonard. "Tillie's Allsorts", a 50th birthday tribute to pianist Melvyn Tan "Double Trouble" and an ongoing diary of miniature piano pieces, "Shivereens".
In 2012 his opera ballet "Hot House", a cultural Olympiad commission, was premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

Rules of the Game (song)

"Rules of the Game" is a 1983 single by UK pop group Bucks Fizz.
Overview.
The song was written by Warren Harry (under the name Warren Bacall), who had written their top 10 hit "When We Were Young" a few months earlier. It was produced by Brian Tench with co-production by Andy Hill.
Released in November 1983, it proved to be one of the group's least successful singles, peaking at No.57. Despite this, it remained on the Top 100 Chart for 10 weeks. The record's chart failure was commented on by the group some months later, with member Jay Aston stating; "It didn't get played. It came out a bit too soon after 'London Town' and got a bit lost among the Christmas stuff". Bobby G agreed that the record company was putting out too many singles at the time, "We gave them a lot of material and record companies, being what they are, released it." Following this they decided simply to not give any of their finished material over. As a result, the next single was released some nine months later.
The single was released in tandem with their first "Greatest Hits" album. The B-Side, "When We Were at War", a ballad, was written by the group themselves. At 6 minutes running length, it remains the longest song recorded by the group. "Rules of the Game" features lead vocals by member Cheryl Baker. The song's lyrics centre on a woman who becomes famous and turns her back on her old friends, but when the fame ends, she finds herself desperately lonely. Baker has since said of her dislike for this song, stating that she finds the lyrics depressing and was unhappy with the affected way she was asked to sing, although it remains a fan-favourite. The Promotional Video shows the group performing the song as moderators of a game featuring two martial arts players.
An extended 12" version of the song was produced but never released at the time. It finally surfaced on a re-release of the group's "Are You Ready" album in 2000.

Casey Fields

Casey Fields is a $30 million, 70 hectare multi-sports complex in the City of Casey at Cranbourne East a southeastern suburb of Melbourne.
The complex is home to Australian rules football, cricket, netball, tennis, cycling and golf. Rugby football and soccer fields are also planned as part of future development.
Australian rules football.
The first stage cost $4.2 million and opened on 29 April 2006. The facility consists of five ovals, the main one being home to the Casey Scorpions Victorian Football League side and also the Cranbourne Football Club in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League's Casey-Cardinia Division. The current capacity of that oval is around 15,000, with plans to add more stands.
NAB Cup pre-season regional challenge matches have been played there, with the record crowd being 10,099 set in 2007 when Hawthorn played Essendon.
It has been touted as a potential training base for several Australian Football League clubs, notably the Melbourne Football Club. The AFL is proposing it as the future site for a boutique stadium in Melbourne of similar size to Optus Oval or Skilled Stadium, with plans to build more stands so that it can become a third option for AFL regular season matches, behind the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Etihad Stadium.
The ground also hosted many of the games played during the 2008 and 2009 AFL National Under 18 Championships. In February 2009 Melbourne played the Western Bulldogs in front of a crowd of 3,000 on a very wet day, with the Western Bulldogs winning by 38 points.
Lack of public transport access.
Since the 1990s it has been proposed that Cranbourne East railway station would be built adjacent to the complex, on a short extension from the current Cranbourne terminus of the former South Gippsland railway line. This has not yet eventuated. The only current alternative is the "Train Link" bus from Cranbourne station to New Holland Drive, and then a 15 minute walk to the complex.

Augats, seyós qui credets Déu lo Payre

Augats, seyós qui credets Déu lo Payre (, sometimes called the "Plany de la Verge") is a Catalan poem of lamentation ("planctus") in the "planctus Mariae" tradition, in which the Virgin Mary laments the death of her son. It was written between 1240 and 1260 and is thus one of the oldest Catalan poems, although it is comes two hundred years after the "Cançó de Santa Fe". The piece is sometimes confused with the "Plant de la Verge" of Ramon Llull.
Structurally, "Augats" is divided into twelve stanzas, each composed of five monorhyming decasyllabic lines followed by tetrasyllabic single-line refrain and a final decasyllabic line without rhyme. The language of the poem is heavily influenced by the Occitan of the troubadours and the courtly love lyric.
The poem is preserved in four manuscripts. It was first brought to light by Jaime Villanueva in 1821, when he redacted it for publication from a manuscript in the archives of the church of Àger. Villanueva found it entitled "Planctus Sanctae Mariae virginis". Its language (whether Occitan or Catalan) became at once an issue of debate. The first two lines of the second stanza are a direct translation of an earlier Latin lament, "Qui per viam pergitis". The poem, which was perhaps performed, is the first-person lament of the Virgin Mary over the crucifixion of her son, Jesus Christ:

Anyang Foreign Language High School

Anyang Foreign Language High School (Korean: 안양외국어고등학교, Hanja: 安養外國語高等學校) is a private high school in South Korea. The school is located in Anyang Country of the Gyeonggi Province. The school is classified as a foreign language high school. 
It is designed for the study of English, Chinese, and Japanese. The school is divided into three departments: The Department of English, the Department of Chinese, and the Department of Japanese.
The overall purpose of the department is to create global leaders through an exchange of culture and subsequently naturally understanding the languages. 
History.
Current.
AFLHS avoids conventions of education in Korea. For example, the school has no bells to begin or end classes. This means autonomy of both teachers and students. Students also have their own study groups. In each study group, students have debates and discussions on their favorite topics. The school has a computer registration program for taking special courses. All students can register courses that they want to take by using the special computer program at home. It is like the current system of many universities.
School Activities.
Cultural exchange.
The school has many sistership schools abroad: Delhi Public School in India, Waseda University in Japan, Hanoi - Amsterdam High School in Vietnam and more. Students visit sister schools more than once a year. Students from sistership schools experience homestays with A.F.L.H.S. students, as well. Every year, students go abroad for a week to experience foreign cultures: Japan, China, and Singapore. Students have cultural exchanges with undergraduate students of Waseda University and the National University of Singapore.
Club activities.
There are currently more than 50 clubs for extra activities. Student can join the clubs they want, such as WOW (football club), EDIT (English Journal), UNESCO (volunteer work), Silchunsarang (sign language), and many sports, drama, and broadcasting clubs. A student can join more than one club so they experience various kinds of activities.
Teacher evaluation system.
At the end of a semester, students evaluate their homeroom teacher and their subject teachers. Students can write whatever they want about teachers. They can also point out good things and bad things about school policies. The teacher evaluation allows teachers to have the time to review the last semester and to prepare for the next semester.

Old Perth Fire Station

Old Perth Fire Station (Fire Brigade No. 1 Station) is located at 25 Murray Street, at its intersection with Irwin Street, Perth, Western Australia
The Fire Station was the first purpose-built fire station in Western Australia. It was opened in 1901 and continued in operation until 1979. The building now houses the Fire & Emergency Services Education and Heritage Centre.
Built form.
The Fire Station was designed by Michael Cavanagh with Romanesque Revival stylistic influences and built around 1900. It is a two storey rusticated limestone and tile roofed corner building, and has a diverse facade with arches, turrets and recessed colonnades. 
History.
The Fire Brigade's original premises were located in the undercroft area of the Perth Town Hall, for which they paid a nominal rent. In 1899 the Fire Brigades Board proposed that land be bought in the proximity of the Town Hall and a new Fire Station be built. In October 1899 it was reported that the Roman Catholic Bishop Gibney had offered some land at the intersection of Murray and Irwin Streets, which was then purchased for ₤3,125. A list of architects was then submitted to the Board which on 26 October 1899 selected Michael Cavanagh, with the stipulation that the building he design not exceed ₤4,000. Michael Cavanagh, was an architect who came from Adelaide to Perth in 1895, attracted by the gold boom prosperity in Western Australia, forming his own architectural firm, Cavanagh & Cavanagh, with his brother James. Cavanagh also designed the Great Western Hotel (Brass Monkey Hotel), alterations to St Mary's Cathedral, Mount Hawthorn Hotel (Paddington Ale House), Fremantle Fire Station (1908), St Patrick's Basilica (Fremantle), Sisters of Mercy Convent (Bunbury) and remodelled the Archbishop's Palace. In the early 1900s Cavanagh was a member of the Perth City Council and a member of the Perth Fire Brigade Board. The building was completed in December 1900 and the Fire Brigade moved into their new premises on 1 January 1901.
By 1910, the Fire Brigade was finding it necessary to expand and decided that the No 1 Fire Station would have to be extended in order to accommodate extra plant, extra workshop accommodation, Boardroom and Officers` Quarters. The block adjacent to the Fire Station in Irwin Street was purchased from the Roman Catholic Church and the Board at a cost of ₤2,100 pounds. This block of land had a school building on it, so the building committee recommended that the Fire Brigade Staff (many of whom were skilled tradesmen) "...undertake the building of the workshops and lecture room with the old material available in the School". James (Jack) Learmonth Ochiltree was appointed as the architect for the additions (Ochiltree's firm, Ochiltree & Hargrave, went on to design a number of Inter-War Art Deco buildings in Perth). The additions to the building, consisting of new boardroom, offices, apparatus room, ambulance shed, store and chief officers` quarters, and was completed in 1914.
Current use.
In 1979, the Perth Fire Brigade vacated the building, which was subsequently restored between 1983 and 1985. The external work involved re-roofing with terracotta tiles to match existing, reconstruction of a limestone arch which had been replaced with a concrete lintel to suit larger and higher engines and replacement of columns, mouldings and original doors which had been removed. Internal work included new timber stairs, toilets and a theatrette. New ceiling cornices and ceiling roses were installed to match the period and the existing. 
The building was reopened in 1985 as the Fire Safety Education Centre and Museum. In 2006 further refurbishment works were undertaken to address access by people with disabilities to the buildings and facilities. Now refurbished, the old station characterises both past and present emergency services’ through displays dedicated to the history of Western Australian (WA) fire services and a natural hazards and disasters education gallery. 
Heritage value.
The Old Perth Fire Station building was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 21 March 1978 and was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 1 December 1975. The building is also included on the City of Perth's Municipal Inventory and was interim listed on the State Register of Heritage Places on 13 March 1992. On 3 December 2008 the building was permanently listed on the Western Australian Heritage Register.

Alfonso Iannelli

Alfonso Iannelli was an Italian-American sculptor, artist, and industrial designer.
Based in Chicago for most of his life, Iannelli was born in Andretta, Italy on 17 February 17 1888. He came to America in 1898. He studied to be a sculptor under Gutzon Borglum, later famous for Mount Rushmore.
From 1910 to 1915, he designed posters for the vaudeville acts appearing at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Frank Lloyd Wright's son John saw his work, and the two became friends. John introduced Iannelli's work to his father, Frank Lloyd Wright, who invited Iannelli to work with him on his Midway Gardens project in 1914. Iannelli created several of the Midway's "Sprite" sculptures for Wright. But Wright took all credit for them, and the two would never collaborate again.
He also collaborated with Chicago architect Enrst Grunfeld on several Art Déco-style plaques in 1929 to 1930 for the Adler Planetarium. These contributions include the zodiac signs of astrology and depictions of the planets in their mythological forms.
Afterward, Iannelli collaborated with noted Chicago area Prairie School design architects Purcell and Elmslie, notably on the Woodbury County Courthouse, and with architect Barry Byrne for several church projects in the American Midwest, and one in Ireland. Iannelli also worked on numerous exhibitions at the 1933 Century of Progress (Chicago World's Fair). 
He went on to open Iannelli Studios in Park Ridge, Illinois, in collaboration with his wife Margaret, a talented illustrator and artist in her own right. Iannelli Studios grew to become one of Chicago's most famous art studios at the time. They included more collaborators and expanded into commercial design, advertising, product design, and architectural interiors. 
Among Iannelli's most famous industrial designs are the Streamline Moderne-inspired C-20 "Coffeemaster" vacuum coffeemaker and T-9 electric toaster for Sunbeam Products, which the company introduced as its flagship modern appliances in honor of the 1939 New York World's Fair. Iannelli also designed many significant interiors for churches and movie theaters, two of which remain in operation today: the Pickwick Theater in Park Ridge and the Catlow Theater in Barrington, Illinois. He also designed the large-scale "Rock of Gibraltar" relief on the facade of the Prudential Building (now called One Prudential Plaza) in Chicago.
He died in Chicago in 23 March 1965.

Hale House

"For the Florida home see Hale House (Brooksville, Florida)"
Hale House is a Queen Anne style Victorian mansion built in 1887 in the Highland Park section of northeast Los Angeles, California. It has been described as "the most photographed house in the entire city", and "the most elaborately decorated". In 1966, it was declared a Historic Cultural Monument and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The house was relocated in 1970 to the Heritage Square Museum in Montecito Heights where it remains open to the public.
Early years.
Hale House was built in 1887 by real estate developer, George W. Morgan, at the foot of Mount Washington. Built at an original cost of less than $4,000, the house was originally situated at 4501 North Pasadena Avenue (now Figueroa Street), but was moved to 4425 North Pasadena before it was purchased by James Hale. It is believed to have been associated with the old Page School for Girls which once stood directly across Avenue 44 from Hale House.
The house was purchased by James and Bessie Hale in 1901. The Hales separated a few years after purchasing the house, and the house remained with Bessie. She operated the house as a boarding house until the late 1950s and lived there until she died in 1966 at age 97.
Move to Heritage Square Museum.
The house was inherited by Hale's niece, Odena Johnson, who stated her desire to dispose of it as soon as possible. When plans were announced to demolish the house and build a chrome and steel gas station in its place, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission stopped the demolition temporarily by declaring the house a Historic-Cultural Landmark (HCM #40) in 1966. A column by noted "Los Angeles Times" columnist Jack Smith helped the preservation effort. Smith called the "faded old house" one of the few remaining from the "age of exuberance." Smith described the house's significance as follows:The house has been called 'picturesque eclectic,' meaning its designer took a scroll from here and a fleur-de-lis from there and put everything together with romantic abandon. … Because of its eclectic nature, the Hale house is said to embody, in one package, many architectural inventions of the late 19th century, that buoyant and capricious era. Hale's niece agreed to sell the house for $1 if it could be moved from the site. In July 1970, the house was lifted from its foundation and moved to the nearby Heritage Square Museum in Highland Park. The move cost $10,300 and an additional $3,000 to raise wires so the house could pass under. Jack Smith, who had been an advocate of the home's preservation, attended the midnight moving of the house in July 1970. He later wrote that a "motley and festive" crowd gathered to watch, with cries of jubilation rising when the chimneys survived the move.
Shortly after the move, the house was used as a movie set for a film depicting a house bombed in a war. The house was later restored at a cost of more than $300,000.
Architecture.
The varied architectural style of the house has been described as Queen Anne, Eastlake, Carpenter Gothic, "picturesque eclectic," and "a capricious old gingerbread." Jack Smith overheard a neighbor say of the house, "What architecture! This old house? It's a mishmuch." Smith agreed but called it "a wonderful old mishmuch." Whatever the precise style, the house is an impeccable example of Victorian craftsmanship and design, with ornate brick chimneys, stained-glass windows, wood carvings, and a "corner turret" crowned with giant copper fleur-de-lis.
In a 1966 report to the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission, Raymond Girvigian, the chairman of the historic buildings committee of the Southern California chapter of the American Institute of Architects said:This residence, purchased by James and Bessie Hale about 1901, is a wood frame structure having exterior clapboard siding accented with fish scale shingles and cast plaster ornament around the main, east facade windows and pediments. Other notable features include a veranda at the northeast corner having turned wood posts with curved wood bracket caps and milled ballusters and an ornamental iron rail on its roof. It has brick chimneys with incised geometric detail and corbelled projections at top and a second floor turret window at the southeast corner, also curved wood brackets at the second floor cornice.
Noting the eclectic style, Givigian wrote that the house has "exuberance in ornamentation and detailing without academic rules, based on borrowed styles and forms of the past but mixed in unrestrained though often inventive and charming ways and fine craftsmanship." In announcing its designation of Hale House as a historic monument, the Cultural Heritage Commission gave the following reasons:
This picturesque structure is an outstanding example of the late Victorian period in Los Angeles. Its prime significance is that it perhaps best embodies the essence of, or the most typical features of, this historical style in one given example. The building incorporates the ornate carving of wood, both inside and out, that is fast disappearing. The chimney is characteristic of the high Victorian 'town house' of the period, and the workmanship compares with that of the best built mansions on the old Bunker Hill.
During the renovation of the house, chips of the original colors were found on the house. The exterior was painted to match the colors from the old chips. The interior has been restored to recreate the appearance that it is believed to have had in the 1890s.

Casper (Maya ruler)

"Casper" (August 8, 422 – 487?), also known as 11 Rabbit, was a ruler of the Maya city of Palenque from 435 to 487. He was the immediate successor of K'uk' B'alam I, who founded the ruling dynasty.
Casper came to power in August 435 at the age of 13 and ruled the city for 52 years. Only Pacal the Great is recorded to have ruled Palenque longer.
The real name of the ruler has not been deciphered. He was given the nickname Casper by Mayanist scholar Floyd Lounsbury because his name glyph is said to resemble the cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost.

Tyron Montgomery

Tyron Montgomery (born April 29, 1967) is a film director and media creative. Originally raised in Ireland, near Limerick, Montgomery today is a German citizen, living and working in Munich.
After studying physics in Wuppertal, Tyron Montgomery studied visual communication at the School of Fine Arts in Kassel, focusing on film, animation, and photography. He passed with the highest distinction in 1998.
In 1996, while still a student, he directed his debut film "Quest" which should become the most successful German short film ever, winning the Academy Award for the Best Animated Short Film and more than 40 international awards. Especially the Oscar let the unknown student shoot to fame almost overnight. "Quest", was included in the Animation Show of Shows and other best-of-animation collections.
In 1997, as the youngest person in history, Tyron Montgomery was decorated with the Goethe Badge of Honor, the highest decoration of the Ministry of Arts & Science of Hesse, "in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the cultural landscape of the State of Hesse" as is says in the ministry's official statement.
In the same year, a liaison with the French actress Aurélia Nolin, best known for playing "Lena" in Éric Rohmer's movie A Summer's Tale, led Tyron Montgomery to Paris where he lived and worked the following three years, especially as lighting director and video artist for theater productions. But mainly he worked in London and Bristol on technically challenging commercials as director, lighting cameraman, and VFX supervisor. During this period, he developed the Interlaced Light Recording, a special recording procedure which reduces costs while allowing more flexibility in the post-production.
In 1997, Tyron Montgomery founded his own film production company (Montgomery Film) und produced "Our Garden", the world's first stop motion film for the cinema screen that was recorded and processed entirely digital. "Our Garden" was commissioned by the German Ministry of the Environment as opening film of an open-air show touring the country.
Having programmed since the early eighties and having created websites for himself, since the early nineties, Montgomery founded a second company for web design, multimedia productions and application development in 1998 – the "X-Plosive Media Network". Uncommonly but successfully X-Plosive was operated as a unique teleworking experiment: The twenty web designers and programmers of the network were scattered across the globe and actually never met in person.
The same year, the production of the feature film "The Green Cloud", based on Alexander Neill's famous novel "The Last Man Alive", lead Tyron Montgomery to Germany once more. For 18 months he worked on the movie as VFX supervisor and his two production companies produced all model shots as well as a number of effects and animation sequences.
As a result of this work, Tyron Montgomery relocated from Paris to Munich in Germany. Montgomery Film and X-Plosive Media were merged to "Augenreiz", a single production company for Internet, multimedia and film projects. Today, supported by a network of partners, Augenreiz operates as a full-service agency for clients in Germany, Switzerland and other countries.
In 2004, Tyron Montgomery married the German jewelry designer Anne Gericke. They have two children: Daughter "Ava" (born December 19, 2002) and son "Arian" (born March 10, 2008).
In 2007, together with Seymour Duncker and Rajesh Setty, Tyron Montgomery founded iCharts, a computer software company located in the Silicon Valley, developing online software for data-visualization. In 2008 iCharts was selected finalist at the TechCrunch50 Conference. Duncker and Montgomery applied for a patent for "Creation, Sharing and Embedding of Interactive Charts" which was granted on September 18, 2012.
Since 1997, Tyron Montgomery has been giving lectures at several German universities and film schools. He regularly leads workshops, gives speeches at film festivals and fairs, and is often invited as a jury member of film, multimedia, and design awards, such as the red dot design award.

<doc id="18337294" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18337294" title="Papal selection before 1059">
Papal selection before 1059

There was no fixed process for papal selection before 1059. Popes, the bishops of Rome and the leaders of the Catholic Church, were often appointed by their predecessors or secular rulers. While the process was often characterized by some capacity of election, an election with the meaningful participation of the laity was the exception to the rule, especially as the popes' claims to temporal power solidified into the Papal States. The practice of papal appointment during this period would later give rise to the "jus exclusivae", a veto right exercised by Catholic monarchies into the twentieth century.
The lack of an institutionalized process for papal succession was prone to religious schism, and many papal claimants before 1059 are currently regarded by the Church as antipopes. Furthermore, the frequent requirement of secular approval of elected popes significantly lengthened periods of "sede vacante" and weakened the papacy. In 1059, Pope Nicholas II succeeded in limiting future papal electors to the cardinals with "In Nomine Domini", creating standardized papal elections that would eventually evolve into the papal conclave.
During the Roman Empire.
From Peter to Fabian (64/67–236).
There is no secular scholarly consensus on when and on what terms Saint Peter arrived in Rome, but most agree that he died there in 64 or 67. Moreover, Peter was never contemporaneously referred to as a "pope" or even a "bishop" (επισκoπoς). Unlike the selection process for a deacon, which is outlined in Acts 6:1-6, there is no biblical method for the selection of a bishop; the earliest text mentioning the selection of a bishop is "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" circa 100 AD/CE.
Although the election of bishops in other early Christian communities is often described in contemporary sources, the earliest Roman sources date from 400, claiming that Peter himself appointed Linus, Anacletus, and Clement—in that order—as his successors. The early official lists of Bishops of Rome are considered problematic by scholars because of their bias towards enhancing papal authority and anachronistically imposing continuity; for example, the earliest, the "Liber Pontificalis", dating probably from 354, is notoriously unreliable for the first two centuries.
Recorded public elections (236–492).
The election of Fabian in 236 is related by the legend of Eusebius of Caesarea: a dove landed on Fabian's head and "thereupon the people, all as if impelled by one divine spirit, with one united and eager voice cried out that he was worthy, and immediately they set him on the episcopal seat". This anecdote makes clear that "the choice of bishop was the public concern for the entire Christian community of Rome". Fabian can reliably be regarded as a victim of the persecution of Emperor Decius, after which there was no election for fourteen months.
The next available evidence comes from the schism between Novatian and Cornelius, both elected bishop by their own factions, and both writing to Cyprian, bishop of Carthage for support. Cyprian sided with Cornelius, writing that:
Moreover, Cornelius was made bishop by the choice of God and of His Christ, by the favorable witness of almost all of the clergy, by the votes of the laity then present, and by the assembly of bishops.
Cyprian also remarks that Cornelius had been ordained by sixteen bishops from the surrounding region, while Novatian had only been ordained by three, the first definite evidence of a true schism in the Roman church. That there could only be one bishop per city would be defined into church law by the First Council of Nicaea in 325.
Mark was the first to designate the bishop of Ostia as the first among the consecrators of the new bishop of Rome (the bishop of Ostia is currently the Dean of the College of Cardinals). However, the influence of Emperor Constantine I, a contemporary of Sylvester I and Mark, would help solidify a strong role for the Roman emperor in the selection process: Constantine chose Julius I for all intents and purposes, and his son Constantius II exiled Liberius and installed Felix II (an Arian) as his successor. Felix and Liberius were succeeded in schism by Ursinus and Damasus, respectively, the latter of whom managed to prevail by sheer bloodshed, and he is the first bishop of Rome who can non-anachronistically be referred to as a "Pope" (παππας, or "pappas"). Damasus persuaded the Emperor to decree him "bishop of bishops", a claim that severely antagonized Eastern bishops, leading to the First Council of Constantinople in 381, which dealt in part with the issue of supremacy.
Even with this new title, however, the method of selection of the bishop of Rome remained much the same. Both the clergy and the laity continued to participate in the selection, along with local and imperial politics. Other trends can be observed, as well, such as father-to-son succession between Pope Anastasius I and Pope Innocent I. Emperor Honorius stepped in to resolve the schism between Eulalius and Pope Boniface I (both elected), siding with Eulalius first and then Boniface I. Honorius decreed that any future schisms should be decided by unanimous selection; although this decree has never been employed in resolving a disputed papal election, it indicates the increasing degree of imperial interest in the question of papal succession.
Odoacer.
Elections of the same manner continued largely undisputed until Pope Simplicius, who was terminally ill for enough of his papacy to devote time to succession issues, who decreed that the minister of Germanic general Odoacer, a Roman nobleman, would have the power of approval over his successor (there was no longer a western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus having been deposed in 476): the result was Pope Felix III, the first patrician pope.
Ostrogothic rule (493–537).
The next electoral schism of note developed between Symmachus and Laurentius, who both appealed to Theodoric the Great, the Ostrogoth king of Italy (and an Arian); the result is the first documented case of papal simony, wherein both candidates attempted to bribe the royal councilors, if not Theodoric himself, to influence his choice; Theodoric sided with Symmachus who proceeded to decree that reigning bishops would be able to designate their own successors, ending the participation of the laity for at least a half-century.
This process was used without serious issue until the death of Pope Felix IV, who had given his "pallium" to Pope Boniface II on his deathbed in 530 and decreed excommunication of any who refused to accept the succession. The Roman Senate disliked the lack of election and denounced Felix, affirming a decree of Pope Anastasius II, which had prohibited the practice of a pope designating a successor. Boniface II was supported only by a minority of the clergy, with the larger share supporting Dioscorus, with only Dioscorus's death halting the schism.
Boniface II attempted to re-entrench the practice of appointing his successor, but the public outcry was too great, resulting in a highly disputed election in 532 characterized by widespread accounts of bribery and coercion, which resulted in Pope John II (the first to take a papal name). Athalaric, the Ostrogoth king, forced John II to approve decrees that banned any private agreements to elect a pope and enacting limits on the amount of money that could be spent during a papal election (an early example of campaign finance reform). In fact, Athalaric himself was able to engineer the election of Pope Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, upon John II's death.
Byzantine influence (537–752).
Upon his invasion of Italy, Justinian I forced Silverius to abdicate and in his place installed Pope Vigilius, a former papal legate to Constantinople. Justinian next appointed Pope Pelagius I, holding only a "sham election" to replace Vigilius. Afterwards, Justinian was content with power of approval of the pope, as with Pope John III after his election. Justinian's successors continued this practice for over a century.
The continuing power of appointment of the Byzantine emperor can be seen in the legend of Pope Gregory I writing to Constantinople, asking them to refuse "his" election. Pope Boniface III issued a decree denouncing bribery in papal elections and forbidding discussion of candidates for three days after the funeral of the previous pope; thereafter, Boniface III decreed that the clergy and the "sons of the Church" (i.e. nobles) should meet to elect a successor, each voting according to their conscience. This abated factionalism for the next four successions, each resulting in quick elections and imperial approval. However, Pope Severinus was forced to wait 20 months for imperial approval in 640, receiving it only months before his death. So Pope Martin I refused to wait, insisting on being consecrated only days after his election. This resulted in his abduction by Constans II to Constantinople in 653, where he tried and sentenced to exile. The next seven popes were more agreeable to Constantinople, and approved without delay, but Pope Benedict II had to wait a year in 684. After that, the emperor delegated the approval to the Exarch of Ravenna, the Byzantine governor of central Italy, including the Duchy of Rome.
During the pontificate of Pope Benedict II (684-685), Constantine IV waived the requirement of imperial approval for consecration as pope, recognizing the sea change in the demographics of the city and its clergy. Benedict II's successor Pope John V was elected "by the general population", returning to the "ancient practice". The ten Greek successors of Agatho were likely the intended result of Constantine IV's concession. The elections of this period are known to have been held in the Basilica of St. John Lateran (with the possessor of the Lateran likely to prevail in the event of schism), but the exact participants in the elections are not known with certainty. Lay participation likely still occurred, but the basilica itself was too small for the phrase "with the whole people" to continue to be literal.
The Roman army (controlled by local aristocrats) entered papal politics in 686 by seizing the Lateran upon the death of Pope John V and evicting the clergy, violently forcing the consecration of Pope Conon and Pope Sergius I. The next two elections were also controlled by the army, but with less overt violence. Pope Zachary, in 741, was the last pope to announce his election to a Byzantine ruler or seek their approval.
Frankish influence (756–857).
Pope Stephen II crossed the Alps to appeal for the aid of Pepin the Short upon his election in 752, following the Lombard takeover of Ravenna, resulting in the Donation of Pepin which strengthened the claim of the popes to the "de facto" Papal States, and thus the incentives for secular interference in papal selection. The death of Stephen II's brother and successor Pope Paul I was followed by a bloody schism characterized by Toto of Nepi and Pope Stephen III; after Toto had his eyes gouged out and was imprisoned, Stephen III decreed that the entire Roman clergy had the right to elect the pope but restricted eligibility for election to the cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons (incidentally, the first use of the term "cardinals" to refer to the priests of the titular churches or the seven deacons); the cardinal-bishops, supporters of Toto, were excluded. Of course, the Roman laity quickly regained its role after Stephen III's decree, and maintained its participation until 1059.
Pope Adrian I and Pope Leo III were elected under the rules of Stephen III, but the latter was forced from Rome and sought the aid of Charlemagne. After two unanimous elections, Charlemagne's son Louis the Pious intervened in a bitterly disputed election in favor of Pope Eugene II. Thereafter the process was returned by apostolic constitution to the status quo circa 769, reincorporating the lay Roman nobles (who continued to dominate the process for 200 years) and requiring the pope to swear loyalty to the Frankish ruler. The consecration of Pope Gregory IV was delayed for six months to attain the assent of Louis.
When the clergy and the nobles elected different candidates in 844, Emperor Lothair I sided with Pope Sergius II, the noble candidate; three years later Pope Leo IV was consecrated without imperial approval, which would have been difficult in any case as the Carolingian Empire was in the process of breaking up. Lothair II of Lotharingia indeed failed to impose his own candidate, Pope Benedict III, in 855 until the Roman-elected candidate refused the office (the first recorded historical refusal). Lothair II was present for the election of Pope Nicholas I, who prohibited anyone outside of the Roman community from interfering in papal elections, and as a result Pope Adrian II was consecrated without even informing the Franks.
Pornocracy (904–963).
The assassination of Pope John VIII inaugurated a period marked by short papal reigns, in which as many as twelve popes were killed (sometimes after resignation), three more deposed, and two abdicated—a period known to historians as the "pornocracy" (Greek, "rule of the harlots") or "saeculum obscurum" (Latin, "the dark age"). Following the alliance of Pope Sergius III with Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum (the father of Marozia, Sergius III's son's mother) and his wife Theodora, Theophylact succeeded in creating four of the next five popes. The son of Sergius III and Marozia reached the papacy as Pope John XI, only to be deposed by King Alberic II of Spoleto, who was able to control the installation of the next four popes, eventually installing his own son Pope John XII, whose main act was to crown Otto I as Holy Roman Emperor.
A synod in 963 deposed John XII and elected Pope Leo VIII (963-965), but the Romans would not accept him once his protector, Otto I, departed, prompting the election of Pope Benedict V (964). Otto I would further succeed in appointing Pope John XIII (965-972) and Pope Benedict VI (973-974).
Crescentii era (974–1012).
Otto I's successor, Otto II, was impelled to take over Rome by force in 980 to depose Antipope Boniface VII and install his preferred candidate Pope John XIV (983-984), without even feigning an election.
Pope John XV, the candidate of the Roman nobles upon the death of Otto II, did not survive long enough to be deposed by Otto III, who engineered the election of Pope Gregory V upon reaching Rome in 996. However, Gregory V could not remain on the throne once Otto III headed back for Germany, and the Romans replaced him with Antipope John XVI temporarily until Otto III could return. Otto III reinstalled Gregory V and secured the election of Pope Sylvester II (999-1003) upon his death, only to die himself shortly thereafter, allowing the Roman nobles to choose three popes of their own.
Tusculan Papacy (1012–1044/1048).
Due to the unprecedented actions of Pope Benedict IX (the only pope currently regarded as having served multiple, non-consecutive terms), Henry III found three different popes in 1046 when he arrived in Rome seeking coronation as Holy Roman emperor. Henry III decided to depose all three and install Pope Clement II (1046–1047).
Holy Roman Empire (1048–1059).
Henry III also installed the three successors to Pope Leo IX (1049–1054), all Germans, without the formality of election. However, the death of Henry III and the rise of child emperor Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor allowed Pope Nicholas II (1059–1061) to promulgate "In Nomine Domini" in 1059, ensuring that all future elections (and, eventually, conclaves) would conform to a basic process that has remained largely unchanged for almost a millennium.

Church Street Bridge

The Church Street Bridge is a historic road bridge over the Yarra River and the Monash Freeway in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It links Church Street in Richmond on the north bank with Chapel Street in Prahran on the south.
History.
The first bridge on the site was an iron girder bridge built in 1857. Purchased from the British government at the end of the Crimean War, this bridge had a span with side trusses being solid riveted iron high, designed
to prevent Russian snipers from killing British troops. The bridge was dismantled and reconstructed with stone buttresses on the site.
The current bridge was designed by Harold Desbrowe Annear and opened in 1923, having three reinforced concrete arches supported by piled foundations. As originally constructed all three spans crossed the river, but with the construction of the South Eastern Arterial in the 1960s, the river was diverted away from under the northern span, and the four lane road was built there instead. This method of construction reduced the clearance available to traffic on the road underneath, and in the 1990s in conjunction with the CityLink project the arch elements of this span were removed, and replaced by new elements 0.6 m higher at the crown and 1.2 m higher at either end. Specialised monitoring was required during the process to manage the changing loads on the elements of the bridge.
In January 2007 rehabilitation work was carried out by VicRoads, including waterproofing the concrete deck, replacing the tram tracks, and general resurfacing. Stage two commenced in April 2007 and is due for completion in July 2008, and involved replacement of balustrades and new traffic barriers at the kerbs. The first stage of works had required a total road and tramway closure.
The site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is included a Heritage Overlay.

Cross Ledge Light

The Cross Ledge Light was a lighthouse on the north side of the ship channel in Delaware Bay on the east coast of the United States, southwest of Egg Island Point. It was replaced by the Elbow of Cross Ledge Light and the Miah Maull Shoal Light in the early 1900s and razed by the coast guard in 1962.
History.
Cross Ledge is part of a long system of shoals which delimits the northern boundary of the channel through Delaware Bay. A lightship was placed here beginning in 1823, but the Lighthouse Board, encouraged by the success of the Brandywine Shoal Light further down the bay, decided to construct a screw-pile lighthouse on the shoal. Construction began in 1856 but was interrupted the following winter by floating ice, which destroyed the entire structure. The board reconsidered, and the lightship remained on station.
The Lighthouse Board remained convinced that a permanent light was needed at the spot, and in 1873 succeeded in getting Congress to appropriate funds. Construction began the following year and was completed in 1875. Cross Ledge Light was unlike any other light in the area. It sat upon a hexagonal pier constructed of granite blocks, upon which sat an octagonal two story Second Empire frame house with the lantern at the crown of its mansard roof. A fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. Before the house could be completed, the lightship, having taken refuge behind the Delaware Breakwater, was nonetheless dragged out to sea by ice in February 1875; it was able to resume station until the light was completed, however.
The light survived the years without serious incident, though much riprap was placed about it over the years to protect it from the ice. In the end, however, it was made obsolete by the construction of new lights closer to the shipping channel. The activation of the Elbow of Cross Ledge Light in 1910 marked the same shoal more effectively, and the Cross Ledge Light was abandoned in the same year.
The house remained intact over the years, and during World War II it was used as target during practice bombing runs. Eventually the coast guard burned what remained in 1962, leaving the pier intact. Ironically, there is no beacon or other aid to navigation on the ruins, so that it is marked as a hazard on nautical charts, labelled "ABAND LH (ruins)".

Christian

A Christian () is a person who adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, as outlined in the Bible. "Christian" derives from the Koine Greek word "Christós" (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term "mashiach".
There are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict. However, "Whatever else they might disagree about, Christians are at least united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance.” The term "Christian" is also used adjectivally to describe anything associated with Christianity, or in a proverbial sense "all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like." It is also used as a label to identify people who associate with the cultural aspects of Christianity, irrespective of personal religious beliefs or practices.
Etymology.
The Greek word ("Christianos"), meaning "follower of Christ", comes from ("Christos"), meaning "anointed one", with an adjectival ending borrowed from Latin to denote adhering to, or even belonging to, as in slave ownership. In the Greek Septuagint, "christos" was used to translate the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ ("," messiah), meaning "who is anointed." In other European languages, equivalent words to Christian are likewise derived from the Greek, such as "Chrétien" in French and "Cristiano" in Spanish.
Early usage.
The first recorded use of the term (or its cognates in other languages) is in the New Testament, in , after Barnabas brought Saul (Paul) to Antioch where they taught the disciples for about a year, the text says: "[...] the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch." The second mention of the term follows in , where Herod Agrippa II replied to Paul the Apostle, "Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." The third and final New Testament reference to the term is in , which exhorts believers: "Yet if "man suffer" as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
Kenneth Samuel Wuest holds that all three original New Testament verses' usages reflect a derisive element in the term "Christian" to refer to followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome. The city of Antioch, where someone gave them the name "Christians", had a reputation for coming up with such nicknames. However Peter's apparent endorsement of the term led to its being preferred over "Nazarenes" and the term "Christianoi" from 1 Peter becomes the standard term in the Early Church Fathers from Ignatius and Polycarp onwards.
The earliest occurrences of the term in non-Christian literature include Josephus, referring to "the tribe of Christians, so named from him;" Pliny the Younger in correspondence with Trajan; and Tacitus, writing near the end of the 1st century. In the "Annals" he relates that "by vulgar appellation were commonly called Christians" and identifies Christians as Nero's scapegoats for the Great Fire of Rome.
Nazarenes.
Another term for Christians which appears in the New Testament is "Nazarenes" which is used by the Jewish lawyer Tertullus in Acts 24. Tertullian ("Against Marcion" 4:8) records that "the Jews call us Nazarenes," while around 331 AD Eusebius records that Christ was called a Nazoraean from the name Nazareth, and that in earlier centuries "Christians," were once called "Nazarenes." The Hebrew equivalent of "Nazarenes", "Notzrim", occurs in the Babylonian Talmud, and is still the modern Israeli Hebrew term for Christian.
Modern usage.
A wide range of beliefs and practices is found across the world among those who call themselves Christian. There is usually a consensus among many denominations about what defines a Christian, but disagreement does exist among some sects and denominations on a common definition of "Christianity." Philosopher Michael Martin, in his book "The Case Against Christianity", evaluated three historical Christian creeds (the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed) to establish a set of basic assumptions which include belief in theism, the historicity of Jesus, the Incarnation, salvation through faith in Jesus, and Jesus as an ethical role model.
Hebrew terms.
As the identification of the Messiah with Jesus is not accepted within Judaism, the Talmudic term for Christians in Hebrew is "Notzrim" ("Nazarenes"), originally derived from the fact that Jesus came from the village of Nazareth in Israel. However, Messianic Jews are referred to in modern Hebrew as יהודים משיחיים ("Yehudim Meshihi'im").
Arabic terms.
In Arabic-speaking cultures, two words are commonly used for Christians: "Nasrani" (نصراني), plural "Nasara" (نصارى) is generally understood to be derived from "Nazareth" through the Syriac (Aramaic); "Masihi" (مسيحي) means followers of the Messiah.
Where there is a distinction, "Nasrani" refers to people from a Christian culture and "Masihi" means those with a religious faith in Jesus. In some countries "Nasrani" tends to be used generically for non-Muslim white people. Another Arabic word sometimes used for Christians, particularly in a political context, is "Salibi" (صليبي "Crusader") from "salib" (صليب "crucifix") which refers to Crusaders and has negative connotations.
Asian terms.
The Syriac term "Nasrani" (Nazarene) has also been attached to the Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala, India. In the Indian subcontinent, Christians call themselves "Isaai" (, ), and are also known by this term to adherents of other religions. This is related to the name they call Jesus, "Isa Masih".
In the past, the Malays used to call the Portuguese "Serani" from the Arabic "Nasrani". Today the term "Serani" is used for the creole Christian community of Malaysia today.
The Chinese word is (pinyin: jīdū tú), literally "Christ follower." The two characters now pronounced "Jīdū" in Mandarin Chinese, were originally pronounced "Ki-To" in Cantonese as representation of Latin "Cristo." Likewise in Vietnam the same two characters read "Cơ đốc", and a "follower of Christianity" is a "tín đồ Cơ đốc giáo". In Japan, the term "kirishitan" (written in Edo period documents 吉利支丹, 切支丹, and in modern Japanese histories as キリシタン), from Portuguese cristão, referred to Roman Catholic Christians in the 16th and 17th centuries before the religion was banned by the Tokugawa shogunate. Today Christians are referred to in standard Japanese as "Kuristo-kyo-to" キリスト教徒, or the English-derived term "kurisuchan" クリスチャン. Korean still uses "Kidok-kyo-do" (written in hangul as 기독교도) for "Christian," though the Greek form "Kurisudo" 그리스도 has now replaced the old Sino-Korean "Kidok" for Christ himself.
Russian terms.
Region of modern Eastern Europe and Central Eurasia (Russia, Ukraine and other countries of ex-USSR) have a long history of Christianity and Christian communities on its lands. In ancient times, first centuries after the birth of Christ, when this region was called Scythia - Christians already lived there. Later here the first Christian states emerged, among them - Great Russian Principality (Kyivan Rus, рус. Великое княжество Русское). People of that time used to denote themselfes Christians (христиане, крестьяне) and Russians (русские). Both terms had strong Christian connotations. It is also interesting that time by time the term "крестьяне" got the meaning - "peasants of christian faith" and later "peasants" - the main part of population of the region, term "христиане" saved his meaning and term "русские" began to mean representatives of heterogeneous Russian nation formed on the basis of common Christian faith and language, which strongly influenced the history and development of the region. In the region "Pravoslav faith" (православная вера) or "Russian faith" (русская вера) from earliest times became almost as known as the original "Christian faith" (христианская, крестьянская вера). Also in some contexts the term "cossack" (козак, казак - free man by the will of God) was used to denote "free" Christians of Steppe origin and Russian language.
Demographics.
As of the early 21st century, Christianity has around 2.1 billion adherents. The faith represents about a quarter to a third of the world's population and is the largest religion in the world, with approximately 38,000 Christian denominations. Christians have composed about 33 percent of the world's population for around 100 years. The largest Christian denomination is the Roman Catholic Church, with 1.17 billion adherents, representing half of all Christians.

Marie-Victoire Baudry

Marie-Victoire Baudry (12 December 1782 – 10 November 1846), named Mother de la Croix, was Superior General of the Congregation of Notre Dame.
Baudry was born on 12 December 1782 in the town of Pointe-aux-Trembles (now part of Montreal), the daughter of Toussaint Baudry and Élisabeth Truteau. Baudry went to a convent school in the town and later entered the noviciate of the Congregation of Notre Dame which had taught her, at Montreal in 1799. She was the first native of the colony to enter the congregation. A year later, she took her vows and assumed her religious name, after which she began a teaching career at a mission on the Island of Montreal. She later moved to Lower Town mission at Quebec.
Because of circumstances within her congregation, she left teaching and became involved in the internal administration of the institute. She became Superior General in 1822 for a six year term and was succeeded by Mother Marie-Catherine Huot. She was elected councillor at that time and continued in that post until her death.
Mother de la Croix went on to set up new missions and strongly influenced the curriculum in the schools of the congregation. She died at the Motherhouse of the congregation in Montreal in 1846.

Embassy of Russia in Prague

The Embassy of Russia in Prague is the diplomatic mission of the Russian Federation to the Czech Republic. The chancery is located at nám. Pod kaštany 1 in the Bubeneč neighbourhood of Prague 6 district in Prague.
History of the chancery.
The building which is now the embassy chancery was bought by Jiří Popper, a Czech banker in 1927. Edvard Beneš, the then President of Czechoslovakia in exile and Jiří Popper, both of whom knew each other, fled to London on the same aircraft in 1938. 
The Bubeneč Popper house and surrounding land was confiscated by the Nazi authorities on 16 March 1939, a day after their occupation of Czechoslovakia, and was subsequently used as the Prague headquarters of the Gestapo. In 1945, after the end of the war, the family attempted to reclaim the property, but were prevented from doing so due to the nationalisation decrees of Beneš, who returned to Czechoslovakia as President. Although Beneš was aware that the Czech–Jewish banker was still alive and intended to return to Prague, the property was granted to the Soviet Union by Beneš as a gift in thanks for the Soviet liberation of Czechoslovakia from Nazi rule. The building was used by the Soviets to accommodate the embassy of the Soviet Union to Czechoslovakia.
The Popper family were to receive compensation for the property, however, this did not eventuate due to the installation of a communist government in Czechoslovakia in 1948.
In 1990, laws were passed in Czechoslovakia which made it possible for restitution to be offered for property which was confiscated after 1948. The Czech Constitutional Court has overturned several of the Beneš decrees and in July 2008, Lisbeth Popper, the daughter of Jiří Popper, filed suit in the Czech courts against both the Czech and Russian States seeking restitution of the property. According to the court filings, the property is valued at CZK1 billion, which in the event of the claim being successful would be paid by the Czech State. The Russian State, which assumed title to all foreign property owned by the Soviet government after the dissolution of the USSR, would also lose title of the property and a new chancery for the Russian embassy to the Czech Republic would need to be found.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that the property is protected under current Czech legislation and international law and that it dismisses any attempts by parties to claim property of the Russian state, either inside or outside of Russia.

The Vinyl Underground

The Vinyl Underground is a comic book series published by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics, created and written by Si Spencer with art by Simon Gane. The title debuted in October 2007 and ran for twelve issues before its cancellation in September 2008.
Overview.
Background.
Unveiled at the San Diego ComiCon in 2007 by Vertigo's Karen Berger as "'yet another' good Vertigo book about England," "The Vinyl Underground" is described by its author, Si Spencer as "a love-hate story about the streets London that shaped its characters, and that shaped its author."
Spencer—who writes for TV series EastEnders -- credits London, his "adopted home now for ten years," with "thousand years of violence [which have shaped its streets," as well as fiction set within them. Spencer writes in the Vertigo column "On the Ledge" that the city "constantly barginto the story uninvited," informing in the process the "right narrative voice" for the "Vinyl Underground" series.
Illustrator Simon Gane described the title as "scary, glamorous, fun, dark and articulate," (while fellow-artist Andi Watson noted that Gane's work "a bit saucy") but also "hard to draw." Gane's work on "The Vinyl Underground" was deliberately drawn "in a more realistic style," than his usual (self-described as "warped") work, which move he felt " a constructive effect on my drawing and story-telling."
The first issue was released on October 3, 2007 (cover-dated December) featuring cover art by Sean Phillips. Gane summarized the series as being "set in London and featur an ad-hoc group of self-appointed detectives who become embroiled in occult-tinged crimes with a strong supporting cast of mobsters and so on."
While author Spencer stressed that it was:
"not just a detective thriller about a bunch of graduates hanging out in an abandoned underground station investigating occult crime," but also featured the city of London as a major 'character'.
Publisher Vertigo described the series as a "fast-paced, ultra-cool ongoing crime-noir series," featuring "an unlikely quartet of occult detectives secretly solvcrimes — from DJ crack bars in Camden to the elegant, high-society ballrooms that make up modern London."
Characters.
The four-man group is led by minor celebrity DJ Morrison Shepherd, the "son of an ex-footballer" recently released from prison. Shepherd is aided by Perv (Callum O'Connor), an ex-con clairvoyant "whose seizures give him clues to crimes long before the cops," Leah King, a morgue assistant who moonlights as an internet model/pornstar, and Shepherd's ex-girlfriend Kim "Abi" Abiola, an "African tribal Princess in exile" whose witchdoctor father is accused of the murder which becomes the group's first mystery. Abi is also described by Spencer as "an expert in the psycho-geography of London," a theme which has also informed the works of writers Alan Moore, Iain Sinclair and Will Self, among others.
Living in an abandoned Underground station, the group investigates occult crimes in a manner evocative of fellow-Vertigo character John Constantine, providing anonymous tip-offs to the police force through D.S. Caulfield.
Collected editions.
The series has been collected into a couple of trade paperbacks:

Delilah (novel)

Delilah, by Marcus Goodrich, was first published in 1941.
It revolves around the activities of the fictional American destroyer, the USS "Delilah", and her crew in and around the Philippines in the time period from 1916 to 1917. The novel is loosely based on Goodrich's own experiences as a sailor on board the , a destroyer.
Much of the book constitutes detailed descriptions of various characters, punctuated by plot developments associated with the ship's mission in general support of maintaining order in the southern islands of the Filipino archipelago, populated by Muslim natives dissatisfied with the center of government in the northern island of Luzon. The relationship between the enlisted men and the officers on board the "Delilah" receives special treatment. This relationship can be seen as a logical link between the strict stratification of naval personnel in the age of sail and the more egalitarian navy that emerged following World War II.
The novel was an immediate success upon its initial publication. Although the author's foreword expressly states his intention to write a sequel, and the story ends on the eve of the United States' entry into World War I following an extensive overhaul of the "Delilah", no sequel was published. 
Goodrich was the first husband of actress Olivia de Havilland. The union produced one child (Benjamin), who died in 1991 following a long battle with cancer.

TopoQuest

TopoQuest is a free web mapping service built on open source software that provides internet-based topographic maps for most of the United States.
The site is one of three internet services used by Wikipedia for providing topographic maps. It arose to prominence in May 2008 after TopoZone through its new trails.com owners required payment for access to its maps. TopoQuest map links are the same as Topozone's except for the difference in the domain.
It is operated by Ryan Niemi in Klamath Falls, Oregon.
Niemi first experimented with a mapping program in July 2001 as a Linux, PHP and MySQL alternative to Microsoft's TerraServer-USA topographic mapviewer.
The domain was registered at Go Daddy to Sunset Dynamics on August 10, 2004.
However Niemi did not aggressively develop the website because of the success of Topozone.
After Topozone started the for pay business model on April 8, 2008, Niemi made updates to get the website to match the Topozone URL methodology for viewing 1:24K USGS Digital raster graphic maps available from the Libre Map Project and Internet Archive and was operating by May 2008.
Code was adapted from the MapServer project at the University of Minnesota. The viewer was made seamless by incorporating GDAL.
In addition to matching the Topozone URL's, the website offers free download of GeoTIFFs, which Topozone had only offered for a premium.
TopoQuest started adding Canadian 1:50K scale topographic maps in July 2008, and USGS 1:100K and 1:250K scale topographic maps in March 2009.

<doc id="18337810" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18337810" title="Austrian legislative election, 2008">
Austrian legislative election, 2008

A legislative snap election for the National Council in Austria was held on 28 September 2008. The previous election was held on 1 October 2006. The election (the 24th in Austrian history) was caused by the withdrawal of Austrian People's Party leader Wilhelm Molterer from the governing grand coalition (led by the Social Democratic Party of Austria) on 7 July 2008. Due to dissatisfaction with the grand coalition and the two main parties, it was widely expected to be a realigning election, with gains for the opposition and up to seven parties expected to be in the National Council after the election. The losses for the government parties (both the SPÖ and the ÖVP had the worst election result in history) resulted in strong gains for the far right, while neither the Liberal Forum nor the Citizens' Forum Austria (both of which were considered to have chances of gaining seats) gained as much as 2% of the vote, defying earlier expectations. The result of the election was seen as strong for the far-right and in support of Eurosceptics.
Molterer resigned as party chairman as a result of the losses suffered by the ÖVP and was replaced by environment minister Josef Pröll; the Greens' federal spokesman Alexander Van der Bellen (in office since 1997) also resigned and was replaced by his deputy, Eva Glawischnig. Due to the LIF's failure to enter parliament on its own, LIF founder Heide Schmidt and financier Hans-Peter Haselsteiner both declared their complete withdrawal from politics, and the LIF's fate was seen as uncertain. Shortly after the election, BZÖ leader and Carinthian governor Jörg Haider died in a car accident.
Background.
On 11 January 2007, the Gusenbauer cabinet (a grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP) was sworn into office. The newly formed government was criticised from the beginning from parts of the opposition and left-wing circles in the SPÖ for having failed to push through in the coalition negotiations most of the pledges and promises made in the election campaign.
The SPÖ began to fall back in the polls almost immediately. The government was frequently unable to agree on important decisions: The SPÖ demanded an antedated tax reform in 2009 instead of in 2010, which the ÖVP disagreed on; the proposal to help households hit by inflation with a tax gift of €100 was also denied by the ÖVP. The coalition partners also disagreed on the badly necessary health system reform. In the Tyrolean state election on 8 June 2008 the former ÖVP member Fritz Dinkhauser led his newly founded Citizens' Forum Tyrol to become the second-largest party, causing large losses to ÖVP and SPÖ and small losses to the Greens. Following this, internal criticism within the SPÖ of Gusenbauer grew, leading to the decision to designate infrastructure minister Werner Faymann as its new party leader. According to the plans at that time, Gusenbauer would have remained the leading candidate in the 2010 elections.
On 26 June 2008, Faymann and Gusenbauer wrote a letter to the editor of the leading Austrian tabloid "Kronen Zeitung", declaring they were in favour of referendums on important EU topics, like new treaties after the already ratified Treaty of Lisbon or the accession of Turkey to the European Union. They did this without seeking the approval of either the party leadership or their coalition partner ÖVP; it was widely perceived by Austrian and foreign media as a populist action and submission to the anti-European "Kronen Zeitung", which had been conducting anti-EU campaigns for years. On 7 July 2008, ÖVP leader Wilhelm Molterer declared that he could not continue to work with the SPÖ (the precise words with which he opened the news conference were "That's enough!", "Es reicht!"). The ÖVP declared as the main reasons for the snap elections the change in the SPÖ's position on Europe and the planned dual leadership in the SPÖ, which the ÖVP claimed would make agreement on difficult issues even harder.
The snap election was officially called in a parliamentary session on 9 July 2008 through a joint resolution by SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens, which FPÖ and BZÖ supported; the election date of 28 September 2008 was confirmed by the government and the main committee on 10 July 2008. The term of the legislature was the third-shortest in Austrian history (after 1970–1971 and 1994–1995). SPÖ and ÖVP agreed to a so-called "Stillhalteabkommen", an agreement according to which neither of the two parties would try to outvote the other with the votes of the opposition parties, although this agreement was revoked by Faymann on 25 August 2008.
The age required to have the right to vote had been reduced from 18 to 16 prior to the election in an electoral law reform enacted in 2007, which also had reduced the age required to stand in the election from 19 to 18, had introduced easier access to postal balloting and had lengthened the legislative term from four to five years. Another change was that different list names in the different states were no longer possible; the BZÖ had stood under a different name in Carinthia than in the rest of Austria in 2006. Turnout was initially expected to increase from the all-time low of 78.5% in 2006; more than 80% were expected to participate in the election according to early estimates, but it expectations changed to a decrease of turnout as the election day came closer. Postal balloting was expected to make up 7%–8% of the total vote; due to postal votes, the final result of the election would not be known until a week after the elections (on 6 October 2008). Postal ballots had to be sent to electoral commission together with a signed piece of paper stating the time and place when the vote had taken place; at a spot check in Salzburg, 20% of postal ballots were invalid because they lacked the signature or time and place. 9.27% of the voters (586,759 of 6,332,931 voters) had requested postal ballots, which meant that postal ballots could decisively change the election outcome.
Another part of the 2007 electoral reform was that it was now possible to accommodate election observers in the election process. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development declined the invitation to send observers, however, stating that the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights had insufficient funds to send observers on such short notice.
The Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" stated that Dinkhauser had "with hindsight been the first link in a chain of causation which led to the early elections, even though he had only wanted to force open the incrusted political landscape in Tyrol". ("Rückblickend wurde damit der Tiroler Dinkhauser, der mit seiner «Liste Fritz» eigentlich nur die verkrusteten Verhältnisse in Tirol aufsprengen wollte, zum ersten Glied jener Kausalkette, die zu der Ankündigung vorgezogener Neuwahlen geführt hat.")
The election set a record for the largest number of parties contesting the election nationally, with ten parties:
In addition, four lists contested the election in some states (the total of fourteen lists contesting the election in at least one state also constituted a record):
The previous records had been achieved in the 1994 election, when eight parties contested the election nationally (SPÖ, ÖVP, FPÖ, Greens, LIF, KPÖ, No to NATO and EU and the United Greens of Austria) and thirteen in at least one state (the eight mentioned before plus the Christian Electoral Community, the Austrian Natural Law Party, the Civic Greens of Austria, The Best Party and the list Fritz Georg).
Parties.
The following parties were involved in the 2008 Austrian legislative election:
Analyses and forecasts.
Analysts and pollsters offered different opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good chances of getting into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were as good as they had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated to be the very first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.
Following the announcement that Haider would return to federal politics, analysts held different opinions on the likely effects of this change. While the race for swing voters between ÖVP, FPÖ and BZÖ was seen to intensify, it was also remarked that Haider has lost much of his appeal and that it would be unlikely that the BZÖ would increase its share of votes just because of his candidacy. The race for third place between the Greens and the FPÖ was seen to be balanced (as Haider might draw votes from the FPÖ and the LIF from the Greens) or slightly in favour of the Greens. One analyst even expected that Haider would attempt to get the FPÖ to adopt a partner relationship with the BZÖ (similar to the Christian Democratic Union–Christian Social Union of Bavaria alliance in Germany), with the BZÖ only operating in Carinthia and the FPÖ in the rest of Austria, after the 2008 election. Stadler confirmed that this was the goal of the BZÖ. Strache explicitly ruled out such an alliance on 7 September 2008.
Four weeks before the election, analysts agreed that the climate was very good for the SPÖ following Faymann's announcement that he would take measures against rising prices, although they also cautioned that the SPÖ's victory was not yet a done deal. The FPÖ was seen as strongly increasing their share of the votes when compared to the 2006 election and the BZÖ was seen as having secured its stay in the National Council. The Greens were seen to be stagnating, while the extraparliamentary parties faced difficulties with entering parliament, with the chances of LIF and the FRITZ intact.
Former ÖVP leader Wolfgang Schüssel claimed on 4 September 2008 the ÖVP's low numbers in the polls were due to the large number of parties contesting the election and denied that the ÖVP had made mistakes in their election campaign so far. Analysts asserted that the Greens' decision to strongly support the animal rights activists remanded in custody under controversial circumstances (see above) might be risky, but that it might pay off through the increased publicity and mobilisation of core voters.
Only four possible coalitions were seen as likely to have a majority after the election: SPÖ–ÖVP, ÖVP–FPÖ–BZÖ, SPÖ–GRÜNE–BZÖ and SPÖ–FPÖ–BZÖ; all but a new grand coalition were seen as unlikely.
Campaigning.
Campaigning in the 2008 Austrian legislative election revolved around inflation, rising prices, transport, future treaties of the European Union, crime, integration, right to stay, education, privatisation of Austrian Airlines, budgets, TV schedule, fairness accord, the Eurofighter Typhoon contract renegotiation and the Role of the Kronen Zeitung.
Election day.
For the first time in the history of Austrian elections, there were different ballots in all nine states (in 2002 there were three different ballots, in 2006 there were seven). The ballots featured parliamentary parties in the order of votes they received in the last election, i.e. SPÖ, ÖVP, Greens, FPÖ, BZÖ. The extraparliamentary parties were listed in the order in which they submitted their state candidate lists, and this order was different in all nine states; Dinkhauser, for instance, wanted the FRITZ to be the last on the ballot in all nine states, but the Left (in Burgenland and Tyrol) and the Christians (in Salzburg) submitted their lists after he did. The longest ballots could be found in Carinthia and Vienna, which broke the previous record of eleven lists (Vorarlberg, 1994) with twelve lists. Burgenland, Salzburg, Tyrol and Upper Austria had eleven lists, and Lower Austria, Styria and Vorarlberg had only the ten national lists on the ballot.
National candidate lists had to be submitted by 8 September 2008 and were published on [12 September 2008 in the "Wiener Zeitung"; all lists except STARK and Klement submitted national candidate lists.
Voting booths closed at 13:00 in Vorarlberg, at 16:00 in Carinthia, Styria and Upper Austria, at 16:30 in Burgenland and at 17:00 in Lower Austria, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vienna.
Reactions.
The election saw a historically low turnout. Both the SPÖ and the ÖVP had the worst result in history, while the combined so-called "third camp" ("drittes Lager", consisting of the FPÖ and the BZÖ) had the best result the far right has had in the Second Austrian Republic, very nearly gaining a plurality of seats if taken together. The Greens suffered slight losses, while neither the LIF nor the Citizens' Forum Austria crossed the electoral threshold of 4%. Government formation was expected to be very difficult and take a long time as both the SPÖ and the ÖVP had to assess and analyze their losses and decide on a course of action. The primary motive for the people who voted for the far right parties was dissatisfaction with the governing parties, which was summarised by "Der Standard" as "angry voters voting for angry parties". Josef Pröll gained the most state preference votes (59,583 on the Lower Austrian candidate list), with Faymann gaining 6,236 in Vienna and Strache 6,009 (also in Vienna). Strache also gained the most regional constituency preference votes (24,301), followed by Haider with 15,836 and SPÖ trade unionist Josef Muchitsch with 9,998.
The SPÖ lost many voters to the FPÖ, while the ÖVP lost many voters to the BZÖ. The Greens lost a few voters to the LIF, and all three parties lost voters to the non-voters. Neither the SPÖ nor the FPÖ changed their positions after the election; the SPÖ reiterated it would never enter into a coalition with the FPÖ and the BZÖ, while the FPÖ did not waver in its stance of opposition to reunification with the BZÖ, although it toned down its rhetoric and stated it was open to closer cooperation. Nonetheless, many FPÖ voters and party members were reportedly strongly in favour of reunification; it was expected that Strache would have to reconsider his opposition to reunification in the months following the election. The CDU–CSU model proposed by some before the elections seemed to be off the table, as the BZÖ had strongly increased its share of the vote outside Carinthia, as well; on the other hand, the FPÖ had an increased incentive to reach such a cooperation, as it would free up BZÖ voters for the FPÖ outside Carinthia. On 6 October 2008, Haider stated he was against a reunification, as the two parties had developed into different directions and could gain more votes separately than reunified.
Analysts expected Molterer to step down, with the ÖVP taking a pivotal role in the coalition negotiations; under Josef Pröll, it was expected to take part in a renewed grand coalition, trying to win back the voters' confidence, while under another new chairman, it was considered possible the ÖVP could form a right-wing coalition with the FPÖ and the BZÖ. Johannes Hahn and Maria Fekter had been mentioned as possible alternatives to Molterer; a party leadership meeting was held on 29 September 2008. As expected by many, Molterer stepped down and Pröll became acting party chairman, and ÖVP secretary-general Missethon and many other prominent politicians from the Schüssel/Molterer era were also expected to be replaced. Pröll was to become party chairman at a party convention set for 28 November 2008 in Wels. As expected, Pröll was approved as party leader with 89.6% of the votes (the worst result in the history of ÖVP in leadership elections without an opposing candidate); Lower Austrian state secretary Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Tyrolean governor and former interior minister Günther Platter, interior minister Maria Fekter and new chief of the parliamentary party (replacing Pröll) Karlheinz Kopf were elected as deputy leaders. Economy minister Bartenstein and former chancellor Schüssel became backbenchers, as they stated they would take up their seats in parliament but were not going to be elected or appointed to any important position. Pröll announced he would replace Schüssel as chairman of the ÖVP parliamentary group. ÖVP ministers Kdolsky (health) and Plassnik (foreign affairs) were also considered certain to leave politics; they were reportedly looking to work in the World Health Organization and Austrian ambassador to the United States, respectively. Social minister Buchinger from the SPÖ was assumed to be out of federal politics, as well, as he was seen as certain to be replaced by a trade unionist (Csörgits or Kuntzl, as mentioned before the election).
Apart from a renewed grand coalition, some members of the SPÖ, the ÖVP and the Greens floated the possibilities of an SPÖ–ÖVP–Greens coalition (also called "Kenya coalition", referring to the party colours and the colours of the flag of Kenya), having the Greens act as a mediator between the two big parties. A right-wing ÖVP–FPÖ–BZÖ coalition, an SPÖ minority government, an SPÖ–FPÖ coalition, an SPÖ–BZÖ–Greens or an ÖVP–BZÖ–Greens coalition were also seen as possibilities, although unlikely ones. The FPÖ and the BZÖ explicitly declared they were not willing to offer their support to an SPÖ minority government.
The Greens held a party leadership meeting on 30 September 2008; despite the slight losses the Greens suffered, Van der Bellen did not step down, as he was nonetheless regarded as enjoying strong support from both party members and voters; the Greens did not rule out a Kenya coalition or supporting a minority government under some circumstances. It was expected that Van der Bellen would step down at a later date. Van der Bellen resigned on 3 October 2008 and was provisionally replaced by Eva Glawischnig, who had long been considered his designated successor; she was confirmed as federal spokeswoman at the party congress on 17 January, and,18 January 2009 in Klagenfurt with 97.4% of the delegates' votes, the best result for a spokesperson of the Greens so far and also an unexpectedly decisive result; she had stated she was hoping for "more than 80%". Van der Bellen said he would remain an MP. Van der Bellen's resignation came as a surprise, as he was assumed to continue as federal spokesman for a few more months before resigning. Glawischnig was also unanimously selected as chief of the Greens' parliamentary club on 24 October 2008.
The SPÖ and the FPÖ also held party leadership meetings on 30 September 2008. The FPÖ rejected conducting secret negotiations with either the SPÖ or the ÖVP, calling on both parties to declare openly if they wanted to have them as a coalition partner; Strache stated, however, that he would set strict coalition conditions, including holding referendums on the accession of Turkey to the European Union and the Treaty of Lisbon and restricting social benefits to Austrian citizens, which made coalitions with either the SPÖ or the ÖVP highly unlikely. Faymann stated that he was not interested in a Kenya coalition, as a coalition with three partners was only likely to be more difficult to manage than one with two partners. Pröll declared his opposition to both a Kenya coalition and a right-wing coalition with the FPÖ and the BZÖ, leaving the ÖVP with only the possibilities of a grand coalition or the opposition; the party membership was largely undecided between the two options. On 2 October 2008, a conflict arose between the SPÖ and the ÖVP regarding referendums on future EU treaties, as the SPÖ wanted to at least not rule out the possibility in a coalition agreement, which the ÖVP refused to accept under any circumstances.
The FPÖ won back the post of third president of the National Council from the Greens. Three people were primarily mentioned as likely to replace Eva Glawischnig in that position: education spokesman Martin Graf, justice spokesman Peter Fichtenbauer and Lower Austrian FPÖ leader Barbara Rosenkranz. Graf was nominated on 30 September 2008. While the Greens stated they opposed Graf's nomination because of Graf's position as chairman of the nationalist "Burschenschaft" "Olympia", the other parties initially stated they would approve his nomination. After some SPÖ MPs also voiced their reservations about Graf, presidents of the National Council Barbara Prammer (SPÖ) and Michael Spindelegger (ÖVP) stated they would seek personal talks with Graf before his nomination. After Graf refused to renounce his membership in "Olympia", the Greens announced they would propose Van der Bellen as an alternative to Graf. The SPÖ announced its MPs would be free to vote for or against Graf, while the ÖVP stated it would support Graf as the third-placed party by tradition had the right to nominate whomever they wished; it was expected that Graf would be elected with the votes of the ÖVP, the FPÖ and the BZÖ. Graf was elected on 28 October 2008 with 109 votes to Van der Bellen's 27.
All parties except for the ÖVP supported making the appointment of a committee of inquiry a parliamentary minority right; as the ÖVP had fewer than a third of the MPs, it was technically possible for the other four parties to outvote it on amending parliamentary law, but it was unclear whether the other parties wanted to set a precedent by using this option. The ÖVP later announced that it was willing to agree to this change, if committees of inquiry were reformed in general.
Both Schmidt and Haselsteiner declared that their political activities were completely over. Nonetheless, many party members and supporters called for the LIF to continue its work. A party convention was held on 25 October 2008 to start a renewal process and relaunch the party. Werner Becher was elected as the LIF's new leader, although he described his position as a primus inter pares. The LIF announced it would launch a reform process, renew its party program and start to build up strong local party organisations in the cities and the states. At the next regular party convention in April 2009, the party would then approve the changes (and likely change its name, as well; "The Liberals" ("Die Liberalen") was considered the most likely new name), finalising the relaunch as a liberal party putting more emphasis on economic liberalism as well as social liberalism.
Haider's death.
BZÖ leader and Carinthian governor Jörg Haider died in a car accident in Köttmannsdorf near Klagenfurt in the state of Carinthia in the early hours of 11 October 2008. Police reported that the Volkswagen Phaeton that Haider had been driving came off the road, rolled down an embankment and overturned, causing him "severe head and chest injuries". Haider, who was on his way to a family gathering in honour of his mother's 90th birthday, was alone in the government car and no other vehicles were involved. An initial investigation uncovered no signs of foul play, but police stated Haider was going at 142 km/h, more than double the 70 km/h allowed at the location of the accident, and it later emerged that Haider had had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.18 per cent. Countless leading Austrian politicians and former politicians from all parties expressed their condolences. Deputy governor Gerhard Dörfler (also from the BZÖ) took over as acting governor of Carinthia and was then nominated to become governor in his own right on 13 October 2008, while BZÖ general-secretary Stefan Petzner was selected as interim BZÖ leader on 12 October 2008. Haider's funeral was held on 18 October 2008 with much international attention and coverage. After the well-received speech of Haider's widow, Claudia Haider, at the funeral, there were rumours that she might become the BZÖ's candidate for governor in Carinthia in the 2009 state election instead. The vote on who would become governor until the election was to be held on 23 October 2008; the SPÖ nominated Carinthian leader Reinhart Rohr. The Greens announced they would definitely not support Dörfler, while the ÖVP was in negotiations with both the BZÖ and the SPÖ regarding whom they would support. Dörfler was elected with 19 votes to Rohr's 17; Rohr got 14 SPÖ votes, 2 Green votes and 1 BZÖ vote, while Dörfler received 14 BZÖ votes (all but one), 4 ÖVP votes and 1 FPÖ vote. Uwe Scheuch was elected as Carinthian BZÖ leader at the Carinthian BZÖ party convention on 15 November 2008 with 96.2% of the votes.
There were rumours that Haider's death would facilitate the reunification of the FPÖ and the BZÖ, enabling Strache to make a bid for power. Lothar Höbelt, a historian known to be close to the "third camp", stated that the BZÖ would be unlikely to survive without Haider and that the ÖVP could possibly gain back voters from the BZÖ if they played their cards right and forged a right-wing coalition; in the case of a renewed grand coalition, Höbelt expected most BZÖ voters to go to the FPÖ.
Following a series of highly emotional and unprofessional interviews by Petzner (some of which were seen as alluding to a personal relationship between Haider and Petzner beyond mere friendship), there were rumours that he would not become leader of the parliamentary BZÖ group on 22 October 2008 and that Haider's sister and former social minister Ursula Haubner or former defence minister Herbert Scheibner might be selected instead. These rumours were immediately denied by senior BZÖ officials, including Haubner and Scheibner. Carinthian BZÖ MP Josef Bucher, the BZÖ's finance speaker, was selected to become leader of the parliamentary group on 22 October 2008; Petzner stated he himself had proposed this alternative and lauded Bucher's credentials. Doubts over whether Petzner would even stand for party leadership at the next party convention grew in the following days amid rumours that Petzner was becoming increasingly isolated within the BZÖ. Petzner personally stated on 30 October 2008 that it was not yet set in stone that he would stand for party leadership at the next party convention, which would be held after the Carinthian state election on 1 March 2009. The date for the convention was later set for 26 April 2009.
Petzner resigned as interim BZÖ leader on 19 November 2008; there were rumours that the party considered him unfit for the office due to his emotional interviews, but Petzner rejected these claims. Former defence minister Herbert Scheibner took over as interim BZÖ leader, but stated that he would not stand for the post at the party conference in April 2009. Carinthian BZÖ leader Uwe Scheuch and leader of the parliamentary group Josef Bucher were seen as the most likely candidates. Petzner provoked further controversy on 20 November 2008 when he criticised the BZÖ's election campaign and talked about internal campaign details. Scheibner later stated that he would prefer to unite the offices of party leader and leader of the parliamentary group again and suggested Bucher as a candidate; Bucher, on the other hand, preferred to keep the offices separate and proposed that Scheibner remain party leader. On 9 January 2009, disgraced former FPÖ official Reinhart Gaugg (infamous both for his driving under the influence incident and for explaining "NAZI" to be an acronym of positive adjectives) became the first politician to announce his intention to run for BZÖ leader, even though he is not a BZÖ member.
In the week before the party congress, it was rumoured that Styrian party leader Gerald Grosz was also interested in becoming party leader; Scheuch was seen as the most likely candidate, assuming he would run. Scheibner and Gaugg were not seen as likely to even stand for the post. On 16 April 2009, it was announced that Bucher would become party leader, after Scheuch declined to take the position and proposed Bucher instead. As expected, Bucher was elected with 99.4% of the vote.
Government formation.
President Heinz Fischer gave Werner Faymann the mandate to form a government on 8 October 2008.
The government of Werner Faymann was sworn in on December 2, 2008. Following the resignation of Vice Chancellor and ÖVP party chairman Josef Pröll from all political functions, a cabinet reshuffle took place, the new government members sworn in by the President of Austria on 21 April 2011.

Nonggang Babbler

The Nonggang Babbler ("Stachyris nonggangensis") is a recently described species of bird in the Timaliidae family.
This species was first observed by the ornithologists Zhou Fang and Jiang Aiwu while surveying the Nonggang Natural Reserve (弄岗自然保护区) in the Guangxi, China, in February 2005. The type specimen was captured in January 2006, and the species was formally described in 2008.
In appearance it is similar to the Sooty Babbler ("S. herberti"), but differs in having a pale iris, a white crescent behind the ear, a white throat patch with black spots, and a black bill.
In general behaviour it resembles a wren-babbler of the genus "Napothera" in that it prefers running to flying, and seems to spend most of its time on the ground foraging for insects between rocks and under fallen leaves. Its natural habitat is karst seasonal rainforest that, following selective cutting, is dominated by "Burretiodendron hsienmu". The known range is currently restricted to the Nonggang Natural Reserve, but since similar habitat also exists in northern Vietnam and south-east Yunnan, China, it is possible the species may also be found there.

Crossley ratings

The Crossley Ratings were an audience measurement system 
created to determine the audience size of radio broadcasts between 1930 and 1935. 
Developed by Archibald Crossley in 1930, Crossley Inc. conducted tests by calling the homes and asking them what they had listened to the previous night. This survey was referred 
to as "counting the house", by the radio industry.
In the mid-1930s the Crossley ratings were deemed all but extinct due to the creation of the "Hooper Ratings".
These new ratings placed an emphasis on what listeners were actively listening to rather than 
the Crossley system that asked listeners the next day which risked the chance of a person forgetting what they had listened to.

Jesus the Jew

"Jesus the Jew: A historian's reading of the Gospels" (1973) is a book by Geza Vermes, who was a Reader in Jewish Studies at the University of Oxford when it was written. It was originally published by Collins in London.
Review citations and excerpts.
"Fortress picked this book up from the dying Collins firm; it has a 1973 publication date in England. The author has written on the Dead Sea Scrolls, but in this book his main interest is to give a Jewish Portrait of Jesus in his environment. Elaborate reference materials at the back of the book reinforce his arguments and lead readers beyond his significant beginnings. His Jesus is a very recognizable zaddik, a just man, a teacher, an exemplar."
"Already regarded as a turn-in-the-road book, this historical study eschews most theological elements and jolts Christian readers into relocating Jesus in his original Jewish environment. Positive thinking about an often forgotten context; readable by nonspecialists."

Wenrohronon

The Wenrohronon or Wenro were a little-known Iroquoian language-speaking indigenous people of North America, originally residing in present-day western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. They appear to have inhabited the upper Allegheny River valley, between the territories of the Seneca and the Neutrals.
The Wenro were discovered by Franciscan missionary Joseph de La Roche Daillon in 1627 at the site of Oil Springs. Dallion noted the tribe's use of crude petroleum (then a largely unknown substance) as an alleged medicine, a possible factor in the tribe's eventual demise. Along with the Neutral and Erie Nations, they were ultimately destroyed by the Iroquois nations during the Beaver Wars, and were assimilated into the victorious nations. Many were absorbed into the Seneca, who inhabit the territory today. Remaining survivors were exiled into Huron territory.
Language.
Wenrohronon was an Iroquoian language and may have been related to Susquehannock, Wyandot, Erie and Scahentoarrhonon.

Shannondale Springs

Shannondale Springs, is a former American resort associated with mineral springs on the bank of the Shenandoah River upstream from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The water from the main spring was reputed to have mild laxative qualities, while other springs had a sulfurous odor. The resort began in 1820 with the construction of 10 to 12 wood cottages, and a two-story hotel was added the next year. The hotel and some of the cottages burned in 1858. After the Civil War several new brick cottages were built and a new hotel was built on the site of the old in 1890. This hotel burned in 1909 and was never rebuilt. The cottages and accessory structures lasted another thirty years before becoming uninhabitable.
In the late 18th century the Shannondale tract was owned by Fernandino Fairfax (1769-1820), who sold several parcels between 1811 and 1819 to settle debts. A ferry was established around 1819. Fairfax's residence, Shannon Hill, was across the Shenandoah from the Shannondale site. After a good start, the resort struggled until the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Winchester and Potomac Railroad reached Harpers Ferry in 1834 and 1835, respectively. This permitted easy access from Baltimore and Washington, D.C.. However, the loss of the hotel to fire and the coming of the Civil War closed the resort until 1867, when the resort resumed operations on a much-diminished scale. A flood in 1870 caused considerable damage. However, in 1890 a new hotel was constructed with 25 guest rooms, a ballroom and several bath houses. Investors in the new hotel had ties to the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing and Improvement Company, and proposed to mine iron deposits near the springs. However, in 1902 the property was purchased at public sale by H.C. Getzendanner, who reopened the hotel in 1903. By 1919 Getzendanner had sold the resort to E.B. Frye for $500. In 1931 a lessor sold the waters for $1 per five-gallon bottle. The property was sold again in 1937 to Thornton T. Perry, Sr.. Much of the property was later donated to The Nature Conservancy, and in 1986 it was transferred to the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources.
From 1996 the Jefferson County Historic Landmarks Commission has leased the last two remaining structures, a bathhouse and a fountain, and has undertaken stabilization work.

Franz Stephani

Franz Stephani (1842–1927) was a German bryologist specializing in liverworts. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Steph. when citing a botanical name. 
Stephani was born in Berlin, Province of Brandenburg, in 1842. He attended and graduated from the Königliches Gymnasium, whereupon he began training to be a businessman in the wool-spinning industry. He worked both in a toy shop, and in a publishing house. In 1869, he married Marie Kell, daughter of the novelist Julius Kell and had two children. By the age of 34, Stephani began publishing papers on the subject of liverworts. He never attended university, and it is not known how his interest in bryology was sparked.
Stephani is most remembered for his "Species Hepaticarum", a six-volume attempt to catalog all of the world's species of liverworts and hornworts. In 1894 Stephani met with M. W. Barbey-Boissier, son-in-law of Edmond Boissier and owner of the Barbey-Boissier Herbarium in Geneva. In 1897 the Herbarium concluded an agreement with Stephani, by which they would publish "Species Hepaticarum". Stephani in turn bequeathed them his herbarium, drawings, library, notes and scientific correspondence. The first editions of the work appeared in 1898, in the "Bulletin de l'Herbier Boissier", and the final volume 27 years later, in 1925.
This is the only work that has ever attempted such a broad treatment of those groups, and saw the first publication of many new names. Almost 10,000 species are included, with more than 4,000 new ones described by Stephani. Unfortunately, the work is "often much condemned" for being of very poor quality, and "holds the reputation of being one of the most notorious publications in bryology."
Stephani created many new names for species that already had published names, and later researchers were left to sort out the nomenclature problems his work created. It is estimated perhaps only 25 to 35% of his species will prove to be valid upon investigation. A more precise figure cannot be made because "taxonomists are still busy clearing the mess."
The poor quality of Stephani's work in his later years may have been the result of a progressive brain disease that affected work on the final three volumes, and the remnants of his life's work were published posthumously by Bonner in 1953.

Utah State Route 127

State Route 127 is a state highway in the state of Utah that spans within Syracuse in Davis County.
Route description.
The western terminus of the route is at the intersection of SR-110 (4500 West) and 1700 South (west of SR-127, 1700 South becomes the Davis County Causeway, a causeway over the Great Salt Lake that provides access to Antelope Island). The route continues east until it ends at SR-108 (2000 West), while 1700 South continues east along SR-108.
History.
The part of 1700 South east of 2000 West in Syracuse was added to the state highway system in 1931 as SR-108, a designation it still carries. From 2000 West to 4500 West, the road became a state highway in 1935, but with a different number - SR-195 (which turned north on 4500 West to Hooper). The entire length of SR-195 was removed from the state highway system in 1947, but was re-added in the 1960s. A new State Route 127 was designated in 1965, following the 1700 South portion of former SR-195 and continuing west to the north end of Antelope Island via the Antelope Island Causeway; 4500 West was restored in 1969 as a new SR-110. The causeway was closed in June 1983 due to high water in the Great Salt Lake, and in 1991 the state legislature passed a law to fund a reconstruction through the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation. The Utah Transportation Commission gave the causeway to Davis County that year to make it possible for a toll to be charged, leaving SR-127 running only from SR-110 east to SR-108. The new causeway opened in July 1993, ten years after the old one had been closed.

Live at the Palais

Live at the Palais is a live album by American singer-songwriter Michael Nesmith, initially released in 1978. It was recorded in 1977 at the Palais Theatre, Melbourne, Australia.
The material covered on the album was primarily derived from the half-dozen albums Nesmith did on RCA Records in the early 1970s. The album reunited Nesmith with drummer John Ware, whom he'd worked with on the albums Magnetic South, Loose Salute, and Nevada Fighter, and also marked one of his first collaborations with guitarist John Jorgenson and keyboardist John Hobbs; both would play in the group The Hellecasters with help from Nesmith.
Although the album did not sell very well, Nesmith would ridicule the recording in his comedy video, Elephant Parts.
CD Release.
In the early '90s, when the rest of his back catalog was being issued on CD, Nesmith withheld "Live at the Palais" to be included in the releases, citing dissatisfaction with the performance. However, due to the demand of enthusiasts worldwide, consent was granted to not only re-issue the disc, but also to complement the package with nearly a half-hour of additional music. The additional songs are taken from other live performances.

1973–74 Chicago Black Hawks season

The 1973–74 Chicago Black Hawks season was the Hawks' forty-eighth season in the NHL, and the club was coming off their fourth consecutive first place finish in 1972-73, as they finished on top of the West Division with a 42-27-9 record, earning 93 points. The Hawks defeated the St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers in the post season before falling to the Montreal Canadiens in the Stanley Cup final.
Chicago started off the season slow, as they had a 2-4-4 record in their first ten games, however, the club then went on a nine game unbeaten streak to push themselves over the .500 mark. The Hawks would battle with the Philadelphia Flyers all season long for top spot in the West Division, as Chicago would finish the year with a record of 41-14-23, earning 105 points, which was their third highest total in club history. It was not enough though, as the Flyers dethroned the Black Hawks for top spot in the West, as they finished with 112 points. The 14 losses by Chicago was the fewest by the team in one season, while the 23 ties they recorded was a new team record.
Offensively, the Black Hawks were led by Stan Mikita, who had a club high 50 assists and 80 points, while Jim Pappin led the team in goals for the second consecutive season, as he scored 32 goals, and finished with 73 points. Pit Martin had another very solid season, scoring 30 goals and 77 points, while Dennis Hull had 29 goals and 68 points. On defense, Dick Redmond emerged as the offensive leader, scoring 17 goals and 59 points, while Bill White recorded 36 points, while having a team high +51 rating. Phil Russell had 10 goals and 35 points, while having a team high 184 penalty minutes.
In goal, Tony Esposito led the club with 34 victories and a 2.04 GAA, along with ten shutouts while appearing in 70 games. Rookie goaltender Mike Veisor backed up Esposito, going 7-0-2 with a 2.23 GAA in 10 games. Chicago tied the Philadelphia Flyers with the fewest goals against in the league at 164, as both Tony Esposito and the Flyers Bernie Parent would share the Vezina Trophy for their achievements.
The Hawks opened the playoffs against the Los Angeles Kings, who had a record of 33-33-12, earning 78 points, while placing third in the West Division. The series opened with two games at Chicago Stadium, and the Black Hawks used their home ice to their advantage, defeating the Kings 3-1 and 4-1 to take a 2-0 series lead. The series shifted to The Forum in Los Angeles for the next two games, and the Hawks would continue to shutdown the Kings in the third game, shutting them out 1-0. Los Angeles would avoid the sweep by easily handling the Black Hawks 5-1 to send the series back to Chicago. In the fifth game, the Hawks, led by Tony Esposito, would shutout Los Angeles by a score of 1-0 to eliminate the Kings from the playoffs.
Chicago's next opponent was the Boston Bruins, who had finished the season with a 52-17-9 record, earning 113 points, and a first place finish in the East Division. The Bruins swept the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round. The series opened up with two games at the Boston Garden, but it was Chicago who struck first, doubling the Bruins 4-2 in the series opener. Boston responded in the second game, winning a wild game 8-6 to even the series. The next two games were played in Chicago, and the Black Hawks once again took the series lead, defeating Boston 4-3 in overtime, however, the Bruins once again came back, winning the fourth game 5-2 to even the series once again. The fifth game was back in Boston, and the Bruins took their first series lead, dominating Chicago by a score of 6-2. Boston would clinch the series in the sixth game, winning 4-2 on Chicago ice to eliminate the Black Hawks from the post-season.
Draft picks.
Chicago's draft picks at the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft held at the Mount Royal Hotel in Montreal, Quebec.

Rodney Shelton Foss

Ensign Rodney Shelton Foss (May 8, 1919 – December 7, 1941) was a United States Navy officer during World War II. He was killed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while stationed at Kaneohe Bay Naval Air Station.
Early life.
Ensign Foss was born in Monticello, Arkansas on August 17, 1919 to George and Linnie Shelton Foss in the home of his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Shelton.
The family moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Rodney graduated from Pine Bluff High School. He attended the University of Arkansas and Louisiana State University before entering the military. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on September 5, 1940 and received training at Northwestern University in Chicago and was commissioned as an Ensign.
Military career.
Ensign Foss was stationed to Naval Air station, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, assigned to patrol squadron 11. To prepare for a deployment, one of the VP-11 crews had worked the graveyard shift to install self-sealing fuel cells in the wings of PBY-5 aircraft 11-P4. Foss was the graveyard shift duty officer when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor at 0752 hours, December 7, 1941. Ensign Foss was due to be relieved by the Sunday duty officer in about eight minutes just as Japanese aircraft began strafing the flight line occupied by VP-11 and VP-12 and the two rows of the squadrons' PBY aircraft lined up neatly along the ramp area between the hangar and the sea wall. Because they approached from the north, the Japanese arrived at NAS Kaneohe several minutes before the rest of the attack force reached Pearl Harbor, making the shots fired at Kaneohe the first fired in the attack.
Ensign Foss was struck and killed instantly by a 20mm cannon shell during the first strafing run, making it highly probable that he was the first US casualty in the Pacific Theater. Excepting those Americans who volunteered to serve in allied military forces before the entry of the United States into the war, his would be the first combat death of the second world war. When the Sunday duty officer, Ensign Joe Smartt, arrived at the hangar to relieve Ensign Foss, he found Foss dead.
His body was returned to Monticello and he is interred in Oakland Cemetery.
Awards and honors.
He was posthumously awarded a Commendation, a Pacific Fleet medal, and a Purple Heart.
The "Buckley"-class destroyer escort, USS Foss (DE-59), was named in his honor. The ship was christened by his mother on April 13, 1943 at the shipyards in Hingham, Massachusetts.

Sainte-Rosalie, Paris

The Église Sainte-Rosalie is a Roman Catholic church in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, built in 1869 in the honour of Rosalie Rendu, also known as Sister Rosalie.
Location.
The church is located at n°50, boulevard Auguste-Blanqui, at the junction of rue Corvisart.
History.
The church is part of a charitable foundation created by the Abbot Le Rebours, curate of La Madeleine (1822-1894) given over to the Lazarists (founded by Vincent de Paul).
A chapel bearing the name Chapelle Sainte-Rosalie was constructed in 1859 on a large site the Abbot had acquired on the now defunct Rue de Gentilly. He had the chapel built to recognise Sister Rosalie's good work for the needy of the quarter in the first half of the 19th century.
In 1867, the land was expropriated for the creation of the short Avenue de la Sœur Rosalie, which joins the Place d'Italie. With the proceeds of compulsory purchase, another plot nearby was acquired, on the corner of rue Corvisart and the then " boulevard des Gobelins". The new chapel was constructed from 1867 to 1869.
In 1903, the Lazardists were ejected and replaced by diocesan priests, to return again in 1922. On 29 September 1963, the chapel was elevated to church status when it became l'église Sainte-Rosalie. In 1971, the Lazardists once again fell from grace, and were replaced by diocesan priests.

<doc id="18338104" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18338104" title="Protocol Buffers">
Protocol Buffers

Protocol Buffers are a method of serializing structured data.
As such, they are useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates from that description
source code in various programming languages for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.
Google developed Protocol Buffers for use internally and has made protocol compilers for C++, Java and Python available to the public under a free software, open source license. Various other language implementations are also available.
The design goals for Protocol Buffers emphasized simplicity and performance. In particular, it was designed to be smaller and faster than XML.
Protocol Buffers are widely used at Google for storing and interchanging all kinds of structured information. Protocol Buffers serve as a basis for a custom remote procedure call (RPC) system that is used for nearly all inter-machine communication at Google.
Protocol Buffers are very similar to the Apache Thrift protocol (used by Facebook for example), except that the public Protocol Buffers implementation does not include a concrete RPC protocol stack to use for defined services.
A software developer defines data structures (called "messages") and services in a proto definition file (.proto) and compiles that with protoc. This compilation generates code that can be invoked by a sender or recipient of these data structures. For example, "example.proto" will produce "example.pb.cc" and "example.pb.h" which will define C++ classes for each message and service "example.proto" defines.
Canonically, Protocol Buffers are serialized into a binary wire format which is compact, forwards-compatible, backwards-compatible, but not self-describing (that is, there is no way to tell the names, meaning, or full datatypes of fields, without having an external specification). There is no defined way to include or refer to such an external specification (schema) within a Protocol Buffer file. The officially supported implementation includes an ASCII serialization format, but this format — though self-describing — loses the forwards-and-backwards-compatibility behavior, and is thus not a good choice for applications other than debugging.
Though the primary purpose of Protocol Buffers is to facilitate network communication, its simplicity and speed make Protocol Buffers an alternative to data-centric C++ classes and structs, especially where interoperability with other languages or systems might be needed in the future.
Example.
A schema for a particular use of protocol buffers associated data types and field names, with integers to be used to identify each field. (The protocol buffer data contains only the numbers, not the field names, providing some bandwidth or storage saving compared with alternative systems that do include the field names in the data.):
The "Point" message defines two mandatory data items, "x" and "y". The data item "label" is optional. Each data item has a tag. The tag is defined after the equal sign, e.g. "x" has the tag 1.
The "Line" and "Polyline" messages demonstrate how composition works in Protocol Buffers (they both use Point). Polyline has a repeated field, which behaves like a vector.
This schema can subsequently be compiled for use by one or more programming languages. Google provides a compiler called protoc which can produce output for C++, Java or Python. Other schema compilers are available from other sources to create language-dependent output for over 20 other languages - a list can be found here. 
For example, after having produced the C++ version of the above protocol buffer schema, the message objects can be accessed like this in C++:

Annesley railway station

Annesley railway station was a station in Annesley, Nottinghamshire. It was opened in 1874, to serve the town which had grown following the opening of Annesley colliery in 1865. It was closed in 1953 as part of the post-war cutback, and the line closed to passengers in 1964. The station did not reopen as part of the Robin Hood Line project in the 1990s.
History.
Opened by the Midland Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, closing five years later under the control of the British Railways Board.
The site today.
Trains operating on the Robin Hood Line still pass the site. Although the line re-opened in stages during the 1990s Annesley station did not reopen due to its proximity to Newstead.

Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano

Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano, known in Europe as SCAR (an acronym for Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo), is a Gran Turismo-style racing for the PlayStation 2, Windows and Xbox. It was developed by Milestone S.r.l. and released in 2005.
It is similar to the Gran Turismo series except for the role-playing game elements. The game was lauded for having artificial intelligence superior to "Gran Turismo 4". When compared to "Gran Turismo 4", Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano has far fewer cars and tracks. All the cars in the game are manufactured by the Alfa Romeo motor company (unlike Gran Turismo which has vehicle makes and models from countries from Australia to Sweden). While most of the tracks are in Italy, a few are in other countries like Germany and the United States. With a maximum of nine laps in any race, with most races lasting only three to six laps, the races are too short for the game to model pit stops.
A distinguishing feature of the game is that it models driver development using a system almost identical to a role-playing video game. In addition, cars get damaged, both visibly and in performance, by collisions or by driving off course.
Gameplay.
General gameplay.
Like many racing games, the game has a "quick race" mode and a career mode (called "dynasty" mode). The initial choices of cars and tracks in "quick race mode" are very limited; additional choices are unlocked by progress in "dynasty mode". Initially, "dynasty mode" has a limited number of events available to enter. Placing third or better in races unlocks new races, series of races, and championships. At the same time, the game models the development of the driver using a system that is almost identical to a role-playing video game.
This elaborate system of developing the driver's experience is used to toughen up both the player and the car that he or she uses. Experience points (referred to in the game simply as XP), are acquired for various achievements during a race, such as passing opponents, or driving a clean lap. Similar to the way that XP is lost after dying in some role-playing games, failing to finish the race cancels all XP earned in the event. When certain thresholds of XP are reached, a new driver "level" is achieved, and a Skill Point is awarded. These Skill Points can be used to develop driver and car. Additional Skill Points are awarded for other achievements. Some races award a skill point for beating a particular opponent for the first time. There is also a list of dynasty achievements, the completion of which awards a number Skill Points. One such achievement, for example, is going faster than a certain speed in dynasty mode.
Equipment and customization.
All cars in the game are manufactured in real life by Alfa Romeo and in any race the player always races against seven other instances of the model that he or she is driving. The player cannot choose his or her vehicle for a race, except in the "quick race" mode, and even then the opponent vehicles are all the same model. Cars assigned to beginners can go up to . Advanced cars, however, can go faster than NASCAR stock cars .
Cars cannot be customized; instead it is the driver who gets customized, although some driver customizations do affect car acceleration, handling, and damage resistance. Various achievements in the game, primarily achieving XP point levels, are rewarded with Skill Points which can be distributed across nine different categories to affect car and driver characteristics. In addition, the player wins racing gear—helmets, suits, gloves and boots—by winning "gear races" or by achieving a certain number of victories (as well as knockouts). Gear can also be earned by passing challenges. The gear a driver is wearing can be changed to further affect driver (and car!) characteristics. Like in "EverQuest", all the gear that is unlocked in the game has a minimum level requirement. Players who do not meet the minimum requirements cannot wear the new gear until they reach that experience level. Different computer-controlled opponents in a race will have different skill points and gear, resulting in differing driving skills and endurance of both car and driver. All opponent drivers have names shown in lineups and results, but they are not of well-known drivers. Many are probably purely fictional (with some puns), and it is possible that a few names are those of people associated with the game developers.
Driver statistics.
During a race, the game's unique "Tiger Effect" allows players to go back in time a few seconds and try again in the style of a "butterfly effect". Typically, this is used to avoid accidents. The "Tiger Effect" does not automatically cause the player to avoid accidents; usually the player can at least mitigate the effects of the accident. In rare cases, the players' second attempt might actually make things worse. "Tiger Effect" points are decreased by units of 1.0 every time they are used. For instance, using a "Tiger Effect" when a player has 1.7 "Tiger Effect" points will reduce his or her "Tiger Effects" points to 0.7; making it useless until the counter increases itself by 0.3 points. The explanations in the game suggest that the "Tiger Effect" is meant to represent an expert driver's keen ability to anticipate and avoid danger, but at times it feels like a means to “repair” your damaged car by “undoing” a collision.
Building up points in "anticipation" can help increase the frequency that the player can turn back the clock and try to prevent accidents in a single race. Likewise, building up points in "heart" can help the player heal faster so that he or she is less likely to lose focus on the race track. Statistics to improve during the course of the game are named "heart", "vision", "intimidation", "handling", "acceleration", "recovery", "focus", "anticipation", and "endurance". Some of these affect the driver, and others the car, and some affect both.
All drivers start each race with all their available driver condition points. Driving close behind another driver reduces his or her current driver condition points. If a driver loses all such driver condition points, the game calls this a "Knockout". Computer-controlled drivers can do the same thing to the player and each other. If the player receives a Knockout, he or she suffer a temporary loss of control. This is signified by blurry graphics, heart-pounding audio, and a difference in car response.
Eventually this temporary condition ends and driver condition points begin to regenerate according to the rate that is established in the player's statistics. When computer-controlled drivers suffer a Knockout, their driving becomes visibly slower and slightly erratic. Expert players will be able to recognize the pattern that the knocked out vehicle will take and can avoid them completely. The erratic movements tend to include slowing down, wobbling around the course, followed by taking a slight dip to the left or the right (depending on the race track).
Damage model.
All cars start each race with all available condition points. Collisions and/or off-course excursions will visibly damage cars, and reduce car condition points for the duration of the race. Off-road excursions presumably create excessive tire wear and suspension damage to racing cars. In any case, the phenomenon serves to inflict a penalty for cheating short-cuts; excessive off-course excursions can destroy a vehicle the same way that banging it excessively can do. This phenomenon can also reward players who remain on the road by letting them get bumped more frequently before being marked down as a "DNF".
The player's car, and the opponents' cars, can be damaged to zero car condition points. When that happens, retirement is forced. Car damage is shown visibly in the rendered models, as well as on a condition gauge which indicates how much more damage the car can take.

HMS Avon (1805)

HMS "Avon" was a Royal Navy "Cruizer"-class brig-sloop built by Symons at Falmouth and launched on 31 January 1805. In the War of 1812 she fought a desperate action with the USS "Wasp" that resulted in her sinking on 27 August 1814.
Service.
"Avon" entered service at Spithead under the command of Commander Francis J. Snell and sailed for the Mediterranean on 18 April 1805. On 7 May she captured the "Frisken". By 9 May "Avon" was off Lisbon, where the schooner "Milbrook" reported to Snell her capture of the Spanish privateer lugger "Travella", of three guns and 40 men, off the Bayona Islands (Baiona), and the recapture of the British brig "Stork". Then on 20 January 1806, "Avon" was present when "Pomone" recaptured the "Maid of the Mill".
In March 1806 "Avon" came briefly under the command of Commander James Stewart and was employed in convoying and cruising. In May Commander Mauritius Adolphus Newton De Stark took command and sailed "Avon" in the Channel. He was then given the task of escorting to the Baltic the Russian vessel "Neva", which was returning from a voyage of discovery. Hostilities had just begun between Napoleon and Russia and the British government deemed an escort a prudent precaution. For his services the Tsar presented de Stark with a breakfast service of plate and a purse of 100 guineas. 
"Avon" sailed for North America on 28 August. She was carrying Mr Esrskine, HM Minster to the United States. On the way to the United States, "Avon" encountered the French 74-gun "Regulus", which gave chase for eight hours, firing constantly, before de Starck was able to lose her in a squall. "Avon" arrived at Annapolis Royal on 30 October. On his return voyage he met up with an Royal Navy 74-gun ship with orders to go to Bermuda and then to take to Britain despatches from French Admiral Willaumez that "Avon" had taken from an American vessel she had examined on her way out of the Chesapeake. "Avon" arrived at Spithead on 7 January 1807.
In January 1807 Commander Thomas Thrush took command and sailed "Avon" to Jamaica on 16 April. (He had been appointed to her in September 1806 but had had to await her return.) During her time on the Jamaica station lightning struck "Avon", damaging her badly, but fortunately causing no deaths. Thrush also had the opportunity to take "Avon" to Cartagena to pick up a freight of dollars; his commission on the transport when he delivered it to Britain was £2,056. On 1 May 1809 he was promoted to post-captain and removed to "Garland".
In June 1809 Commander Henry Fraser took command. On 15 March 1810, the 28-gun "Rainbow", under James Woolbridge, and "Avon" encountered the French frigate "Néréide", under the command of Jean-François Lemaresquier. Lemaresquier fled to separate the two British ships, but stopped to engage "Rainbow" after "Avon" had fallen back. He soon had reduced "Rainbow" to a battered state, but "Avon" resolutely came in support and put a 30-minute fight against the much stronger "Néréide" before herself retreating. Damage on "Néréide" prevented her from giving chase. Lemaresquier therefore continued on his course, reaching Brest on 30 March. By 1812 "Avon" was back at Portsmouth. 
Commander George Sartorious took command on 22 July 1813 and "Avon" served on the Cork Station. She underwent repairs at Portsmouth in November. Sartorious left her in June 1814 on his promotion to post-captain, and Commander the Honourable James Arbuthnot recommissioned her in July.
Sinking by USS "Wasp".
On 1 September 1814, "Tartarus", "Castilian" and "Avon" recaptured the "Atlantic".
That evening "Avon" encountered the United States Navy brig "Wasp" in the English Channel. "Wasp" spotted "Avon"s sail on the horizon and gave chase. By 9:30pm, "Wasp" had "Avon" under her lee bow and opened fire. "Avon" returned fire until 10pm, at which time her guns, according to the crew of "Wasp", fell silent. "Wasp" then ceased fire and called for "Avon" to surrender, but "Avon" answered with another cannonade. "Wasp" returned fire. Some broadsides later, "Avon's" guns fell silent once more and "Wasp" again called for surrender. "Avon", by now a battered hulk, had no choice but to concede.
Just as "Wasp" began to lower the boat for the prize crew to go aboard "Avon", "Wasp's" lookout sighted another British brig sailing toward "Wasp" and "Avon". "Wasp"s crew manned their battle stations immediately in hope of taking the newcomer, the 18-gun "Castilian", as well. Just then, two more British ships appeared on the horizon. "Wasp" therefore sailed away, abandoning "Avon".
Although the Americans didn't know it at the time, "Avon" sank at 1am, soon after "Wasp" left her. She had lost ten men killed and 29 wounded in the action. "Castillian" rescued the survivors from "Avon".

Censo General de Población y Vivienda

The Censo General de Población y Vivienda ("General Census of Population and Housing", or "National Census of…") is the main national census for Mexico. It is produced by the national statistics agency INEGI, a decentralized agency of the Mexican Federal government, with the purpose of collating and reporting detailed demographic, socioeconomic and geographical data from across the nation. Since 1900 the "censo general" has been conducted on a decennial basis, taking place the year ending in zero of each decade. The only variation to this schedule thus far occurred with the fourth census ("IV censo general"), where difficulties arising from the Mexican Revolution resulted in its deferral from 1920 to 1921. As of 2008 there have been a total of 12 "censos generales" taken at the national level, the most recent completed in 2010.
From the 1990s INEGI began to produce an intermediate series of national population and housing censuses, surveying only a smaller and selected subset of key demographic indicators. This intermediate series—the Conteo de Población y Vivienda ("Count of Population and Housing")—is also conducted decennially, in the years ending in "5" midway between two successive "censos generales". These "conteos" allow the planning for public policy and services to be based on data that is more current than would otherwise be the case, as the alternating "conteos" and "censos" provide a refresh of key population indices that is no more than five years old.
History.
The practice of census-taking in Mexico may have precedents dating back to the late pre-Columbian period. According to traditions recorded in several of the post-conquest historical sources, Xolotl—a 12th-century ruler of a "Chichimec" polity in the Valley of Mexico—ordered that a review be undertaken to enumerate the populace under his control. This survey, carried out at a place adjoining his capital Tenayuca, is supposed to have been conducted by the addition of stones to a pile representing each person counted.
During the later Aztec Empire, it is known that written census-like records were used to keep track of land ownership and the tribute obligations of individual city-states ("altepetl") across central Mexico.
In the decades after the conquest and Spanish colonial expansion, the administrators and missionaries for the "Real Audiencia" of Mexico began the systematic collection of population data for the new territories. One such was the document known as the "Suma de visitas de pueblos por orden alfabético" from 1548, which contained a survey and description of 907 villages and settlements in central Mexico. A census taken twenty years later in 1568, taking in some 90% of the towns and villages of Central Mexico, is probably the most comprehensive of the 16th-century records still extant. During the later Colonial period in the 17th century a number of other demographic counts and compilations were made. In general the data from these—likely incomplete and rudimentary—are no longer preserved.
It was not until the late 18th century that an accounting of the population was conducted, known as the Revillagigedo census, that could be said to resemble a ""censo general"" with something approaching a national extent. Conducted under viceroy Juan de Güemes Padilla, Count of Revillagigedo between 1790 and 1791, some forty volumes of data from this census are conserved in the Mexican national archives.
When Mexican independence from Spain was achieved in 1824, the new Republic sought a process to enumerate the citizens in each of its constituent federative states and entities. Article 12 of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico expressed the intention:
A census of the whole confederation shall be taken within five years, and shall be renewed afterwards every ten years, which shall serve to designate the number of deputies to which each state is entitled. In the meantime the elections are to be regulated on the basis established in the preceding article, and the census which served to regulate the election of deputies in the congress now in session.
Official census dates.
The following table lists the official dates of all the national population censuses conducted, since the first formally recognised one in 1895.

Bran ua Máele Dúin

Bran ua Máele Dúin (or Bran mac Dúnchada) (died 712) was a king of the Uí Cheinnselaig of South Leinster. He was of the Sil Máeluidir sept of this branch of the Laigin, who were found in the later baronies of Shelmalier on the lower reaches of the Slaney River in southern modern County Wexford. The date of Bran's accession is unknown but the "Book of Leinster" king list gives him a reign of three years which would correspond to 709-712. 
His last paternal ancestor to hold the kingship was Éogan Cáech mac Nath Í who would have lived in the early 6th century of whom Bran was a 5th generation descendant. Bran's grandfather Máel Dúin mac Máel Uidir was the son of the eponymous founder of his sept. The last member of this sept to hold the throne was Forannán mac Máel Udir whom the king lists would place in the late 6th century.
The "Annals of Ulster" record that in 709 the Uí Cheinnselaig fought the Battle of Selg in Fortuatha Laigen (east of the Wicklow Mountains) against Cellach Cualann, King of Leinster of the Uí Máil branch of the Laigin in which two sons of Cellach were slain. The "Annals of Tigernach" are however silent on who Cellach's opponents were and mention that he had British mercenaries. The Uí Cheinnselaig were probably the aggressors and the battle may have actually been a standoff despite Cellach's losses. 
The Uí Cheinnselaig however became involved in infighting and in 712 Bran lost his life along with his sons in battle. The "Book of Leinster" calls this battle the Battle of Áth Buichet. One of Bran's sons did survive, Cennselach mac Brain (died 770) who later became king of the Uí Cheinnselaig.

<doc id="18338445" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18338445" title="Selective internal radiation therapy">
Selective internal radiation therapy

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a form of radiation therapy used in interventional radiology to treat cancer. It is generally for selected patients with unresectable cancers, those that cannot be treated surgically, especially hepatic cell carcinoma or metastasis to the liver. The treatment involves injecting tiny microspheres of radioactive material into the arteries that supply the tumor.
History.
Investigations using yttrium-90 (90Y, Y-90) and other radioisotopes for cancer treatment began in the 1960s. Hi Reports of the initial use of resin particles of Y-90 in humans were published in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, the safety and feasibility of Y-90 microsphere therapy for liver cancer were validated in a canine model. Clinical trials of Y-90 applied to the liver continued throughout the late 1980s to the 1990s, establishing the safety of the therapy. More recently, larger trials and RCTs have demonstrated safety and efficacy of Y-90 therapy for the treatment of both primary and metastatic liver malignancies.
Therapeutic Applications.
Patients who are candidates for radioembolization include those with: 
A phase III trial (SIRT versus sorafenib) is in progress.
Procedure.
Y-90 microsphere treatment requires patient-individualized planning with cross-sectional imaging and arteriograms. Contrast computed tomography and/or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the liver is required to assess tumor and normal liver volumes, portal vein status, and extrahepatic tumor burden. Hepatic and renal function tests should be performed; patients with irreversibly elevated serum bilirubin are excluded, and iodinated contrast use should be avoided or minimized in patients with renal insufficiency. Tumor marker levels are also evaluated. Hepatic artery technetium (99mTc) albumin aggregated (MAA) scan is performed to evaluate hepatopulmonary shunting (resulting from hepatopulmonary syndrome). Increased pulmonary shunt fraction (>20%) indicates an increased likelihood of the radioactive particles traveling to the lung during therapy, leading to the adverse side effect of radiation pneumonitis.
The initial angiographic evaluation includes abdominal aortogram, Superior mesenteric and Celiac arteriograms, and selective right and left hepatic arteriograms. These studies allow for documentation of the gastrointestinal vascular anatomy and flow characteristics. Extrahepatic vessels found on angiographic evaluation are often embolized in order to prevent nontarget deposition of microspheres, that can lead to gastrointestinal ulceration. Once the branch of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor is identified and the tip of the catheter is selectively placed within the artery, the 90Y microspheres are infused.
After treatment, Bremsstrahlung scanning is recommended within 24 hours after radioembolization to evaluate the distribution of the Y-90 microspheres. Weeks after treatment, computed tomography is performed to evaluate anatomic changes, and positron emission tomography is performed to evaluate changes in metabolic activity.
Agents.
The microspheres themselves are made of glass or resin. Inside the microspheres is the isotope yttrium-90, which has beta-emission with a half-life of 2.6 days. Currently there are 2 types of microspheres: TheraSphere and SIR-Spheres, which differ in their radioactivity per sphere and embolic effect.
Principles.
Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells; however, normal cells are also damaged in the process. Currently, therapeutic doses of radiation can be targeted to tumors with great accuracy using linear accelerators (see radiation oncology); however, the normal liver tissue is very sensitive to external beam radiotherapy. Fortunately, malignancies (including primary and metastatic liver cancers) are often hypervascular; tumor blood supplies are often increased compared to those of normal tissue. Furthermore, the liver has a dual blood supply, receiving blood from both the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Hepatic malignancies derive most of their blood supply from the hepatic artery; whereas the normal liver derives most of its blood supply from the portal vein. Therefore, delivery of radioembolic particles through the branch of the hepatic artery supplying a tumor will preferentially lead to deposition of the particles in the tumor, while sparing normal liver from harmful side effects.
Adverse Effects.
Complications include postradioembolization syndrome (PRS), hepatic dysfunction, biliary complications, portal hypertension, radiation pneumonitis, gastrointestinal ulcers, vascular injury, and lymphopenia.
Postradioembolization syndrome (PRS) includes fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, abdominal discomfort, and cachexia, occurring in 20-55% of patients. Steroids and antiemetic agents may decrease the incidence of PRS.
Biliary complications include cholecystitis and biliary strictures.

Girtford Halt was a railway station on the Varsity Line which served the hamlet of Girtford near Sandy in Bedfordshire, England. A short-lived railway halt, it was opened by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1938, only to close to passenger traffic two years later in 1940. The line itself closed in 1968 and the site of the station has been obliterated by a roundabout.
History.
In January 1938, the LMSR opened Girtford Halt at the point where the A1 crossed the Varsity Line, a little to the north of the small hamlet from which it took its name. A siding for vegetable traffic had existed on the station site since 1863 and this remained open. Passenger facilities consisted of little more than a raised concrete platform, access to which was had via the field to the rear of the station; tickets had to be purchased from a nearby garage. The station was, however, little used and passenger services were withdrawn in November 1940, the station remaining open for the purposes of freight until 1951. 
Present day.
No trace of the station remains and its site has been taken over by a roundabout on Georgetown Road, a new road skirting the London Road Industrial Estate.

Phillip Pendal

Phillip George Pendal (4 February 1947 – 3 June 2008) was a Liberal and later Independent Western Australian politician, pro-life advocate, and historian.
Early life.
Born in Bunbury, Western Australia, Phillip Pendal was raised and schooled as a Catholic and his strong Catholic principles continued to influence him for the rest of his life, culminating in him being honoured by the Pope John Paul II with the Holy Cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice (Cross for the Church and the Pontiff) on 14 April 2005.
Prior to his career in politics, Pendal worked as a print journalist from 1965 until 1975, winning a cadetship with WA Newspapers that saw him writing for Bunbury’s "South Western Times" from 1966 until 1968, when he was made editor of the "Manjimup-Warren Times". From 1969 until 1975 he worked at the "Daily News", an evening newspaper in Perth, where he rose to prominence in his coverage of state politics as State Political Roundsman.
Pendal was married to Maxine Mayrhofer from 1969 until his death, and the couple raised three children: Sasha, Simon and Narisha.
Parliamentary career.
His coverage of politics led to Pendal being employed as a press secretary for Sir Charles Court and other ministers in the Court Liberal Government, and from 1971 to 1995 he was an active member of the Liberal Party. In 1980 he was elected to the Legislative Council to represent the South-East metropolitan province, and from 1983 until 1993 he was a shadow minister and opposition spokesman in a number of portfolios, most prominently the Environment portfolio. His performance as shadow environment minister was widely praised and considered by many to be an important factor in the Liberal party’s victory in the 1993 state election, and some analysts believe that his continuation in that portfolio in the Court government might have averted the government’s defeat in the 2001 election.
Although he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as the member for South Perth in 1993, he was not appointed to the front bench of the new government, and on 30 March 1995 he resigned from the Liberal Party, continuing his parliamentary career as the Independent member for South Perth until his retirement in 2005.
Pendal was a prominent advocate of pro-life issues during his parliamentary career, most notably in his unofficial leadership of those opposed to the divisive 1998 debate over the decriminalization of abortion. He was also a strong opponent of the death penalty, and his crossing of the floor to support its abolition in 1984 was instrumental to the bill’s passage.
Later life.
Pendal was also a published author and historian, who wrote a number of works concerning the history of Western Australia and in particular the history of the Parliament of Western Australia, along with a biography of former WA premier Albert Hawke. At the time of his death, he had finished another work awaiting publication, a history of Catholic education in Western Australia due to be published in September 2008.
Pendal died of a heart attack in 2008, and was widely praised by his former colleagues from both sides of parliament as a passionate and eloquent parliamentarian of great personal integrity.

John Grubb

Born in Stoke Climsland, Cornwall, he was the 4th son of Henry Grubb Jr. and Wilmot (maiden name unknown). Henry was an early Quaker who was imprisoned several times for his beliefs. With no chance of being established in his home village, John and his older brother Henry came to West Jersey in 1677 on the Kent, the first ship of settlers organized by William Penn. While he arrived without the funds required to buy his own land, by 1682, he earned enough money to acquire a one-third interest in a tract on Naaman's Creek in Brandywine Hundred where he built his tannery. John was one of the early settlers who greeted William Penn in 1682 when he arrived in New Castle before he founded Philadelphia. Ultimately Penn and Grubb clashed over property they jointly owned and were unable to settle the dispute in their lifetimes.
John Grubb married Frances (c1660 - Bef. 1721) (maiden name unknown) and was survived by nine children. In the early 1700s, he moved to Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania where he died. At that time, John owned 500 acres, which was typical of the early settlers to the Delaware Valley.
Biography.
Early years in Cornwall.
The Grubb family was first recorded in Stoke Climsland, Cornwall in 1329 and over the centuries lived in the small village as tenant farmers and trades people. John's father, Henry Grubb Jr. (1617 - bef 1677) was a butcher who rented a small piece of land. He was also an early Quaker who was imprisoned in January 1663/4 for his beliefs. He had eight known children, including at least seven with his second wife, Wilmot (maiden named unknown)(c.1625 - 1698). Christened in Stoke Climsland on August 16, 1652, John was Henry's fourth known son. In his youth, John apprenticed as a tanner with the Hawkins family, Stoke Climsland Quakers closely associated with the Grubb family.
1677 - Sailing on the Kent.
By the mid-1670s, the Society of Friends faced a crisis: two-thirds of Quaker children were migrating to the cities and leaving the church because Quaker parents found it too expensive to establish their children when they came of age. To Quaker leaders including William Penn, the solution was to create a colony across the Atlantic in West Jersey where land could be made available inexpensively. 
Settlement of West Jersey began in 1675 when Major John Fenwick, one of the two original Quaker purchasers of West Jersey, sailed on the Griffen and founded Salem, across the river from New Castle, Delaware. Fenwick quickly experienced problems with almost everyone including Edward Byllynge (the other purchaser of West Jersey), and Governor Andros in New York. A number of the Salem settlers became disenchanted with Fenwick and relocated across the Delaware to the Brandywine region on the modern border between Pennsylvania and Delaware. William Penn was appointed as trustee to settle Byllynge's financial difficulties and decided to organize settlers to populate Byllynge's portion of West Jersey. Penn sent letters to Quaker Meetings announcing his intention to lease ships beginning with the Kent leaving in the late spring of 1677. 
By 1677, John's father was dead and his widow, Wilmot, lived with her oldest son, Anthony and his family. John finished his apprenticeship about the time the small Quaker Meeting in Stoke Climsland heard about William Penn’s plans for West Jersey. The Meeting organized a small contingent of young adults from Stoke Climsland to sail on the Kent. The fare was high: five pounds, but for only another five pounds John could buy enough land in the Delaware Valley for a tannery and a decent sized farm. John’s brother Henry could not pay the fare and agreed to become an indentured servant for three years. 
After picking up passengers from the Yorkshire port city of Hull, the Kent sailed from London in late spring with 230 settlers and landed outside of Salem. While some of the Kent's passengers settled in Salem, most remained with the ship when it sailed up the Delaware River and established Burlington, West Jersey. Henry and John Grubb and the rest of the Stoke Climsland group remained in Salem. Penn himself remained in England for another five years.
Shortly after the arrival of the Kent, John Grubb became one of the 150 individuals involved with the West Jersey venture to sign the West Jersey Concessions and Agreements. Largely based on the ideas of Edward Byllynge, a radical republican, West Jersey's governing document was one of the most democratic constitutions of the colonial period. In August 1676, the trustees and the proprietors first signed this constitution in London. A year later, the resident proprietors and other West Jersey inhabitants signed the constitution just after the Kent arrived. The fact that John was one of the signatories was not unusual because almost every free adult male in the colony at that time also signed. However, as an indentured servant, Henry Grubb was not one of the signatories. After he finished his three-year indenture, Henry moved to Burlington where he opened a tavern and became an elected official. He was survived by two daughters.
1678 - 1681.
In 1678, Robert Wade, one of the Griffen settlers who left Salem for Brandywine, purchased 500 acres on the south side of Upland Creek. That July, John Grubb and his friend Richard Buffington entered into an agreement with Wade to farm this property. Upland was a small settlement across the river from Salem and several miles north of the modern border between Delaware and Pennsylvania. At that time, the European population of the entire Brandywine region including Upland consisted of only several hundred, mostly Dutch and Swedes. Wade erected a large house that became the first regular meeting place for Quakers in what was to become Pennsylvania. The next year, Grubb and Buffington used their earnings to acquire their own property. On November 25, 1679, they recorded at the court in Upland their joint purchase of a tract on the southwest side of Upland Creek adjacent to Wade’s property. Wade also wanted this property. While William Penn had not yet received the charter for Pennsylvania, by 1680 Penn’s intentions were commonly known. Upland was the leading candidate to become the capital of Penn’s colony and the Upland Creek tract would have become prime property. 
Wade accused Grubb and Buffington of breach of contract and embezzling his grain. After arbitration failed, the court at New Castle heard the charges in December 1680, and the jury found for the defendants, Grubb and Buffington. This didn’t end the matter, and shortly thereafter Wade was in possession of the Grubb-Buffington tract. Gilbert Cope speculates that they transferred their property to Wade in repayment of some debt. However, this seems improbable because Grubb and Buffington won the court case. It is more likely that Wade made Grubb and Buffington an attractive offer for the property. While Wade made an attempt to convince William Penn's agents to establish the new colony's capital at Upland, Penn announced his decision to establish Philadelphia further upriver. As a result, Wade’s tract did not become as valuable as Wade had hoped.
John’s dispute with Robert Wade is probably the reason there has been considerable confusion concerning John’s religion. All of his known actions until this dispute suggest that he was a Quaker until then. He probably became an inactive Quaker about 1680 because Wade was the most prominent Quaker on the west side of the Delaware River and the only meeting place was in his house.
Grubb's Landing, Delaware.
After selling the tract in Upland, John acquired a one-third interest in a tract on the Delaware River at Naaman’s Creek in modern Claymont, Delaware just south of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. This tract was jointly owned with two Dutchmen, Isaac Savoy and David Bilderbeck. The Naaman’s Creek tract was the beginning of what would be the Grubb family’s homestead for almost 300 years. Buffington acquired his own tract on Brandywine Creek in East Bradford, Pennsylvania. William Penn was granted the charter for Pennsylvania in 1681, and sailed from England the next year. Just before he left, Penn purchased Delaware from the Duke of York because the Duke decided that it was too troublesome to administer Delaware from New York. Penn arrived at New Castle on October 29, 1682 and was met by a group of early settlers, including John Grubb.
One of the early tasks of the new colony was to record tracts owned by the few settlers already in the area. On September 19, 1682, even before Penn arrived, a survey was made of the Naaman’s Creek property for John Grubb and his partners. This survey did not subdivide the property between the three partners, and later this was to cause considerable problems with William Penn. The survey was confirmed by a warrant dated April 26, 1684. Today, this area appears on the map as Grubb’s Landing, although John’s sons probably established the landing itself after his death. A modern street down to the river from Route 13 is named Grubb’s Landing Road. Grubb's original house was rebuilt in 1783 by this great grandson, Amer Grubb and today is the administrative building for the Holy Rosary Church in Clayton. Another street in the area named Grubb Road ran along the southern side of Naaman’s Creek. The eastern half of this street from Route 13 to Arden became Harvey Road in 1887, but the portion west of Arden still retains its original name for several miles. 
John’s next land transaction was recorded on September 3, 1691 involving a tract purchased from Thomas Gilpin adjacent to the Naaman’s Creek tract. Here John built his tannery that became the center of a substantial tanning industry that lasted in the area until the nineteenth century.
Family.
It is often held that John Grubb's wife was Frances Vane, daughter of Sir Henry Vane, the second governor of Massachusetts. That belief, promulgated by Judge Ignatius Grubb in 1893, has endured and continues today. However, Henry Vane's daughter Frances was buried in Kent County, England on June 4, 1683. While it is possible that Frances Grubb's maiden name was Vane, she certainly was not Sir Henry Vane's daughter.
Political career.
John began his political career in 1692 when he was elected to a one-year term in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from New Castle County including Brandywine Hundred. The major issue that year was a dispute between the three lower counties (that ultimately became Delaware) and the rest of Pennsylvania over the need for military defenses. The Nine Years' War with the French had started three years earlier. The lower counties, where Quakers were a minority, strongly supported defense construction. They were opposed by the upper counties that were solidly Quaker and did not feel exposed to a potential threat from the French fleet. A tax to construct defenses was proposed, but rejected by the Assembly. The next year, John did not return to the Assembly and was appointed a Justice of the Peace. He was also responsible for tax collection and his own property was assessed at 200 pounds: an amount which one source termed, moderately substantial. In 1698, John was elected to the Assembly for his second term.
Dispute with William Penn.
From the beginning of the colony, Penn planned several manors for his heirs. One of these manors, known as the Rocklands, was to be in Brandywine Hundred including the Naaman’s Creek area. Penn purchased a tract from Judge William Stockdale of New Castle, and traded land in West Jersey for Isaac Savoy and David Bilderbeck’s portion of the tract they owned jointly with John Grubb. John refused Penn’s similar offer to relocate. Further, John took the position that because he already lived on the land, that he should have first choice of which portion he would receive in the subdivision. This would have resulted in an irregular property line that was unacceptable to Penn. As a result, the two never agreed on the line. In 1691 and 1692, Penn’s agents complained that Grubb was making “daily Havock and Spoyle” of the timber on that portion of the tract claimed by Penn. 
In 1699, Penn returned to Pennsylvania after a fifteen-year absence. Upon his arrival, Penn ordered his young Secretary, James Logan to complete the establishment of the manors and resolve the property line dispute with John Grubb. However, the matter was not settled and the dispute carried over into politics. In January 1700, Penn called a special session of the Assembly to deal with the piracy question. The sheriff of New Castle failed to collect the votes from the upper Brandywine Hundred area. John Grubb along with Cornelius Empson, who was to have his own problems with Logan, led a petition drive to overturn the election results. On January 25, the Assembly met and decided that the sheriff should be rebuked, but that the session would start without holding a new election because the session was limited to just the question of enacting stronger piracy laws. That October, John won a seat in the regular Assembly election. However, the voters in the southern part of New Castle County complained that they had not been notified, and the Assembly ordered a new election. This time John was defeated. At Penn’s request, the Assembly recodified the colony’s laws but failed to address the defense issue. The upper and lower counties remained as divided as ever on the need for defenses. Delaware appealed directly to the crown and was granted its own independent legislature in 1704. Penn himself returned to England in 1701 and would never again visit his colony.
Logan remained in Pennsylvania as Penn’s agent. In a letter dated February 26, 1702, Logan instructed Isaac Taylor to resurvey Stockdale’s plantation and divide Penn’s portion of the Naaman’s Creek tract from the land owned by “that troublesome man John Grubb”. However, John objected to the resulting line and cut down the marked trees. Logan’s letters of 1712 indicate that John’s children still held the property, and that the dispute remained unresolved. Ultimately, the Grubb family not only retained the Naaman’s Creek tract, but also acquired substantial portions of the former Stockdale property.”
Later life.
After his death at age 56 in March 1708, John was buried at the St. Martin’s Episcopal Church cemetery in Marcus Hook. The original St. Martins was built in 1700, although the current structure dates to 1845. The deed stipulates that no Quaker be buried there. While this may have been relaxed later, it is unlikely that John Grubb would have been interred at St. Martin’s in 1708 had he been a Quaker at that time. John’s widow, Frances remarried to Richard Buffington, John’s old friend. They lived on the Brandywine Creek tract in East Bradford, Pennsylvania. The date of her death is not recorded but was before 1721 when Buffington remarried again.
John Grubb’s major asset at the time of his death was 500 acres, an amount typical of early Delaware settlers even though the average farm of the period only used eighty acres. Land was becoming more expensive and was selling for two pounds per acre improved and six shillings per acre unimproved. While Non-Quakers left a double share of their land to the oldest son, John followed the Quaker pattern and gave equal shares of his land to each of his seven sons. It was not possible to divide his land because of the ongoing dispute with Penn. The formal division did not occur until 1761, by which time only two of his sons remained alive. There was an understanding among his sons concerning the use of this land and a more formal division only became necessary to establish the rights of the next generation. John’s other assets were substantially higher than average because he was both a farmer and was engaged in the tanning trade. These assets were valued at 566 pounds, including debts of 303 pounds owed to him. John left a cow and one-third of his personal estate to Frances and various amounts to his daughters.

Blunham railway station

Blunham was a railway station on the Varsity Line which served the small village of the same name in Bedfordshire. Opened in 1862, the station was located in a rural area and saw little passenger traffic; it closed together with the line in 1968.
History.
Travelling from Oxford in the direction of Cambridge, Blunham was the first station on the Varsity Line which was built in the architectural style of the Bedford & Cambridge Railway, a style which included strong gables in yellow gault brick together with red brick dressings and string courses. As with the other Bedford & Cambridge-built stations with the exception of Potton, the main station buildings were situated on the down side and a wooden shelter served for passengers on the up platform. The two platforms were low and steps were often needed to reach coaches, illuminated at night by the station's oil lamps. 
The station had a substantial goods shed which contained a 25cwt crane and sidings controlled by a 20-lever frame signal box. A longer private siding led southwards to Beeson's Mill which produced linseed oil on the banks of the River Ivel. The station like many others on the Bedford & Cambridge's line saw much traffic in vegetables - notably potatoes, leading to special trains being laid on to arrange for the collection of goods for carriage to Bletchley and onward transport to London. 
The station served a relatively rural community - there were 598 residents in 1901 - and this, coupled with its remote location to the south of Blunham village, left it susceptible to competition from the motor car. The station eventually closed together with the Bedford & Cambridge-built section of the Varsity Line in 1968.
Present day.
The main station building has been restored and converted into two semi-detached private residences respectively named "Stationmaster's Cottage" and "Station House". The approach road to the station has been redeveloped as a new housing development called "Old Station Court" which continues westwards across the former railway alignment. To the east, the trackbed is intact including bridge no. 15 over the River Ivel which now forms part of National Cycle Route 51.

Anim Zemirot

Anim Zemirot (אנעים זמירות, lit. "I shall sing sweet songs") is a Jewish liturgical poem sung in the synagogue at the end of "Shabbat" and holiday morning services. Formally, it is known as "Shir Hakavod" (שיר הכבוד, lit. "Song of Glory") , but it is often referred to as "anim zemirot", after the first two words of the poem.
"Anim Zemirot" is recited responsively, with the first verse read aloud by the "shaliach tzibbur" (שליח ציבור, lit. messenger of the congregation), the second verse recited by the congregation in unison, and so on. The poem is believed to have been written by Rav Yehudah HeHassid, the 12th-century German scholar and pietist.
Structure.
The main body of "Anim Zemirot" consists of 31 original verses, followed by two verses from Tanach: the first from Chronicles 29:11 and the second from Psalms 106:2. From the fifth to the twenty-eighth verse, the verses each begin with the successive letter in the Hebrew alphabet, except for the letter "reish" (ר) and "tav" (ת), both of which appear twice. As there are an odd number of verses within the main body, the congregation traditionally recites the last verse of the main body along with the "shaliach tzibbur". The last two verses are then recited alone by the members of the congregation; the "shaliach tzibbur" recites the verse from Psalms aloud to indicate the completion of "Anim Zemirot" and allow the members of the congregation who are saying "kaddish yatom" (קדיש יתום, Mourners' "kaddish") to begin their recitation.
The Holy Ark is opened for the recital of "Anim Zemirot", befitting its formal title of "The Song of Glory." There is an account that this name originated because of an old tradition to recite the last four verses of Psalm 24 prior to reciting "Anim Zemirot". According to the Levush, the recital of "Anim Zemirot" has been restricted so that it not become overly familiar and mundane. While most congregations recite it on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, the Vilna Gaon was of the opinion that it should be recited only on holidays. A small minority of congregations recite it only on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
In many synagogues, it has become the custom for "Anim Zemirot" to be recited by a child.
Anim Zemirot is also known as Shir ha-Kavod:
In the very first stanzas, common themes of mystical theology are in place – the lust for secret knowledge, and the desire for intimacy steeped in emotional, almost erotic terms. And the key to the mystical theology of the Pietists is the word KaVoD (Glory):
To the author of Shir ha-Kavod, "Kavod" is the visible manifestation of God. It's the part of God that is graspable by human experience, which is yet not God:
This another common mystical motif, that of paradox: recounting what has not been seen, describing what cannot be known. It is the Glory that makes the "agnostos theos", the unknowable God, yet accessible and relatable, hidden and manifest simultaneously. The Glory is, according to the author, what the prophets saw, what yields angels and anthropomorphic images of deity.
Note also that in stanza four it reads “Glories,” not “Glory.” For the Hasidei Ashkenaz, there are two Glories, a masculine “upper” Glory and a feminine “lower” Glory. The upper Kavod is obscure and inaccessible to mortals, but the lower Kavod can be perceived. From where did this two-fold emanation get derived? From a Biblical encounter between Moses and God."You will see My back, but My face cannot be seen" (Ex. 33:23). It may also be inspired by the Talmudic dictum that one should pray with “eyes directed below and heart directed above” (Yeb. 105b). i.e., look at the lower Kavod while you imagine the unimaginable upper Kavod.
The masculine and feminine element comes from the Song of Songs, chapter 5, and Shir ha-Kavod uses the image of the male lover taken from there – “His locks are curled and black”; “dazzling and ruddy is He”; “His head is like pure gold” – as a description of Kavod. That also leaves open the possibility - unstated in the poem and therefore underdeveloped, but present nonetheless – that Israel itself is the female counterpart, the lower Kavod:
The poem goes on using a letter of the Alef-Bet to start each stanza (some twice), linking the Kavod to the word mysticism found in earlier mystical works like "Sefer Yetzirah".
The poem concludes with an envelope stanza that reuses the verb "to yearn":
The use of the Hebrew word root "Ayin-Resh-Bet" here also has mystical connoations. It means "sweet," invoking the sensuous aspect of the mystical experience. But the same root means "to mingle," ("sh'ti v'airev" means "warp and woof"). This both parallels the opening line ("...and songs I weave...") with the image of interwoven thoughts and reflects the mystic's desire to merge with the divine.

Robert Perew

Robert "Bob" Strahan Perew (August 5, 1923 – November 14, 1999) was an American oarsman who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics.
He was born in Philadelphia, PA and died in Denton, TX. His mother was Bernice Perew (maiden name Strahan) and his father was Robert Jackman Perew. His paternal grandfather was Captain Frank Perew, owner of a fleet of cargo ships on the Great Lakes during the mid - latter 19th Century.
Robert lived in Buffalo, NY and West Palm Beach, FL during his youth. He graduated from Lafayette High School (Buffalo), NY in 1941, then attended Yale University where obtained a degree in mechanical engineering. Midway through his college career he served in the U.S. Navy. Perew was commissioned as the communications officer on the submarine the USS Thornback (SS-418). After serving in the Pacific during WWII, he returned to Yale where he graduated as part of the class 45W in 1949. 
He began rowing at Buffalo's historic West Side Rowing Club while still in high school. During college he was on the Yale crew and also on the U.S. team Rowing at the 1948 Summer Olympics. His event, the Men's Coxless Fours, took the bronze medal for their race. Robert always claimed they could have taken the gold except they thought there was a false start by the German team and hesitated for a second, thus they only placed third at the finish line. Rowing in this event were Gregory Gates, Stuart Griffing, Frederick Kingsbury, and Robert Perew. 
His career included work at General Electric, Electric Boat -a division of General Dynamics, and York International. He always enjoyed boating and lived near Long Island Sound in Waterford, CT for over 40 years.

<doc id="18338588" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18338588" title="XSS worm">
XSS worm

An XSS worm, sometimes referred to as a cross site scripting virus, is a malicious (or sometimes non-malicious) payload, usually written in JavaScript, that breaches browser security to propagate among visitors of a website in the attempt to progressively infect other visitors. They were first mentioned in relation to a cross site scripting vulnerability in Hotmail.
Concept.
XSS worms exploit a security vulnerability known as cross site scripting (or "XSS" for short) within a website, infecting users in a variety of ways depending on the vulnerability. Such site features as profiles and chat systems can be affected by XSS worms when implemented improperly or without regard to security. Often, these worms are specific to a single web site, spreading quickly by exploiting specific vulnerabilities.
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are commonly exploited in the form of worms on popular social or commercial websites, such as MySpace, Yahoo!, Orkut, Justin.tv, Facebook and Twitter. These worms can be used for malicious intent, giving an attacker the basis to steal personal information provided to the web site, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
Examples.
Several XSS worms have affected popular web sites.
Samy worm.
The Samy worm, the largest known XSS worm, infected over 1 million MySpace profiles in less than 20 hours. The virus' author was sued and entered a plea agreement to a felony charge.
Justin.tv worm.
Justin.tv is a video casting website with an active user base of approximately 20 thousand users. The cross-site scripting vulnerability that was exploited was that the "Location" profile field was not properly sanitized before its inclusion in a profile page.
The "Location" profile field was sanitized when included in the title of a profile page but not within the actual field in the page's body. This meant that the authors of the worm, in order to achieve stealth to boost the lifetime and spread of the worm, had to automatically remove the XSS payload from the title of the page from within the worm's code, which was already hidden by comments.
After proper development of the worm, it was executed approximately Saturday, 28 Jun 2008 21:52:33 GMT, and finished on Sun, 29 Jun 2008 21:12:21 GMT. Since the social website that was targeted was not particularly active (compared to other popular XSS worm targets), the worm infected a total of 2525 profiles within roughly 24 hours.
The worm was found a few hours before it was successfully removed, and based on data that was recorded (due to the worm's original intent for research purposes) the worm was able to infect uninfected profiles after they were sanitized forcefully by developers of Justin.tv. The worm was sanitized once more after the vulnerability was patched, and it was able to be removed easily. However, this shows the ability for the worm to adapt and spread even after counter-attack.
Other particular factors which are indicated by the graphs and data released by attackers include social activity and lack of new, uninfected users during periods of time.
Orkut "Bom Sabado" worm.
Orkut, a social networking Site, was also hit by a XSS worm. Infected users receive a scrap containing the words "Bom Sabado" (Portuguese, "Happy Saturday"). Google has yet to comment on the situation.

Willington was a railway station on the Varsity Line which served the small village of the same name in Bedfordshire. Opened in 1903, the station was located in a rural area and saw little passenger traffic; it closed together with the line in 1968.
History.
Willington station only opened in 1903, some forty years after the Varsity Line had first opened, as a result of pressure by local villagers on the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Prior to the station's opening, there had been a siding on the site from September 1896 to handle local vegetable traffic, together with a weighing machine. The station opened at a time when the railway company was looking to increase revenues on the line and was followed by the opening of five halts in 1905 at Wootton Broadmead, Kempston Hardwick, Kempston, Apsley Guise, Bow Brickhill and Husborne Crawley.
The initial station was a very basic single platform structure with wooden weatherboarded outbuildings typical of the LNWR's construction techniques. A second timber platform was added in August 1912 when an unusually long passing loop was laid through the station. A short 16-lever type 5 LNWR signal box was sited on the down platform adjacent to a wooden passenger shelter. At first, trains did not stop at the station unless passengers wishing to join had announced their intention to station staff who would stop the train by signal; passengers wishing to alight had to give notice at the preceding station. The long passing loop was made yet longer on 3 August 1916 to facilitate the increased wartime traffic on the line.
Dwindling goods traffic coupled with the fact that the station served a relatively rural community - there were 204 residents in 1901, rising to 475 in 1961 - plus its slightly inconvenient siting to the north of Willington village, left the station susceptible to competition from the motor car. The station eventually closed together with the Bedford & Cambridge-built section of the Varsity Line in 1968.
Present day.
Station site.
The wooden station buildings were derelict by 1971 and had been cleared away by 1975, leaving the remains of the original brick-built platform. The trackbed through the station has been preserved as part of National Cycle Route 51.
Bedford Rowing Lake.
In July 2006, Bedfordshire County Council approved the construction of the Bedford Rowing Lake for the purposes of the 2012 Olympic Games; the lake will straddle the railway trackbed, taking a 120-metre section out of the route and making any reinstatement as proposed by the East West Rail Consortium far more expensive. The 2,300m lake, which will cost £40m, will cover an area of , and would require a bridge second only in size to the Forth Railway Bridge at a cost of £125m. The Labour Government was criticised for its lack of support for the East West Rail Project and failure to safeguard the trackbed.

Ziegler Polar Expedition

The Ziegler polar expedition of 1903–1905, also known as the Fiala expedition, was a failed attempt to reach the North Pole. The party remained stranded north of the Arctic Circle for two years before being rescued, yet all but one of its members survived. The expedition, funded by William Ziegler and led by Anthony Fiala, departed from Tromsø, Norway, on June 14, 1903, aboard "America". During their first winter, they deposited provisions and coal in Teplitz Bay, Rudolf Island, the northernmost island of Franz Josef Land.
Planning.
Ziegler, who two years before had funded the 1901 Baldwin-Ziegler North Pole Expedition, selected Anthony Fiala, who was a photographer on the previous mission, to lead his second polar expedition. Fiala calculated that the food requirements of an eight dog team and driver would be at least 1100 pounds. This presented an issue, as the maximum sled load capacity was 600 pounds. He planned to use the ponies to carry the extra supplies, and to feed the dogs on horse meat when the supplies dwindled.
Isolation and rescue.
In November 1903, when severe weather ensued, the ship broke up, destroying the provisions and coal. Some wreckage remained, but it disappeared in January 1904 following a storm.
The following spring, more attempts were made to reach the pole by traveling both east and west; however the conditions were too severe, and open water caused difficulties for the expedition. Provisions ran low, and the expedition headed south, eventually reaching depots at Cape Flora, Cape Dillion, and Camp Ziegler.
William Peters, who was second in command, utilized this time and led the crew in survey work, which resulted in improvements to maps and charts.
With the knowledge that rescue ships would be eventually sent to them, the expedition remained hopeful, though expedition leaders struggled to keep them in high spirits.
A rescue party, led by William S. Champ aboard the "Terra Nova", sailed a course direct to the ice fields, and proceeded when the ice condition was favorable. On July 24, they encountered thick ice, causing the crew to doubt their ability to reach their destination. However the ship reached Palmi Island on July 28 and Cape Dillion the following day, where 6 expedition members were found. More members were found at Cape Flora, and the Terra Nova returned to Cape Dillion, where a sled party was organized, which brought back the crew.

Cú Chongelt mac Con Mella

Cú Chongelt mac Con Mella (died 724?) was a king of the Uí Cheinnselaig of South Leinster or Laigin Desgabair. He was of the Sil Máeluidir sept of this branch of the Laigin, who were found in the later baronies of Shelmalier on the lower reaches of the Slaney River in southern modern County Wexford. 
His last paternal ancestor to hold the kingship was Éogan Cáech mac Nath Í who would have lived in the early 6th century of whom Cú Chongelt was a 5th generation descendant. Cú Chongelt was the great grandson of Máel Odor mac Guairi,the eponymous founder of his sept..
Cú Chongelt succeeded to the throne on the death of his second cousin Bran Ua Máele Dúin at the Battle of Áth Buichet in 712 during infighting among the Uí Cheinnselaig.. It is uncertain when his reign ended. The "Book of Leinster" king list gives him a reign of five years which gives him areign of 712-717. The historian Mac Niocaill associates him with the death obit of a certain Cú Chongelt in 724 in the "Annals of Ulster". His brother Laidcnén mac Con Mella (died 727) succeeded him.

Matthew Febey (born 19 August 1969) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Melbourne in the Australian Football League (AFL) during the 1990s.
Originally from Devonport, Febey was drafted to Melbourne in 1986 but suffered from injuries and before he made his senior debut got delisted. He nominated for the draft again in 1992 and was picked up mid-season by Melbourne from his then club Rochester. Almost immediately he made his debut and established a place in the side, often on the wing. An inaccurate kick at goal, his 44 career goals were surpassed by his 60 behinds.
When Febey played his 100th AFL game in 1997, he and his twin brother Steven Febey became the first pair of twins in the history of the league to both achieve the feat. He appeared in six finals matches during his career, including the Preliminary Finals of 1994 and 1998. 
After managing just two games in 2000 due to hamstring and finger injuries, he announced his retirement.

Pennsylvania Department of Corrections

The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PADOC) is the Pennsylvania state agency that is responsible for the confinement, care and rehabilitation of approximately 51,000 inmates at state correctional facilities funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The agency has its headquarters in Hampden Township, Cumberland County in Greater Harrisburg, near Mechanicsburg.
As of February 2011, there are 26 state correctional institutions, one motivational boot camp, one central training academy, 15 community corrections centers, and the DOC contracts with approximately 40 contractors across the Commonwealth that provide transitional services. The DOC employs more than 16,000 individuals and houses more than 51,000 inmates.
History.
Pennsylvania has a distinguished reputation in penology. The commonwealth was the birthplace of the penitentiary concept, also known as the Pennsylvania System. Eastern State Penitentiary opened in 1829, on a cherry orchard outside of Philadelphia, and was considered at the time to be “the world's greatest penitentiary.” Known to historians as "the first true penitentiary," Eastern State operated until 1970.
The Bureau of Correction was created by an act of Legislature in September 1953. The foundation was based on a report by Retired Army Major General Jacob L. Devers, and his special committee to investigate prison problems. The committee was convened shortly after riots at Pittsburgh and Rockview in early 1953. It was the committee's mission to recommend ways to improve the correctional system and reduce unrest. Up to this point the state’s prisons fell under the Department of Welfare. Here they were governed by their own boards of trustees. The Devers Committee suggested the establishment of one agency, whose sole purpose was to manage the state prison system. Appointed by Gov. John S. Fine, Arthur T. Prasse was selected as the first commissioner of corrections, where he remained until 1970.
In 1980, the Bureau of Correction changed hands from the former Pennsylvania Department of Justice, to the newly created Office of General Counsel to the Governor. Constitutional changes resulted in an elected state attorney general, and the disbanding of the Justice Department.
In 1984, under Act 245, the Bureau of Correction was elevated to cabinet level status, making it the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.
Institutions.
The Department of Corrections maintains 27 institutions across the state as well as the Community Corrections Center, where offenders prepare for re-entry into the community.
Contract institutions.
From 2010 until May 2011, Muskegon Correctional Facility in Michigan held Pennsylvania prisoners under a contract.
Death row.
The execution chamber of the State of Pennsylvania is on the grounds of State Correctional Institution – Rockview. Male death row inmates are housed in State Correctional Institution – Greene and State Correctional Institution – Graterford. Female death row inmates are housed in State Correctional Institution – Muncy.
Headquarters.
The agency has its headquarters in Hampden Township, Cumberland County in Greater Harrisburg, near Mechanicsburg. The headquarters are located along Technology Parkway, in proximity to a residential area.
The agency previously had its headquarters in Lower Allen Township, near Camp Hill, also in Greater Harrisburg. In 2010 the former headquarters were crowded with employees. Construction on the new headquarters started around 2010.
Training academy.
The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Training Academy serves as a training area for prison employees working for the state and employees working for the county. It is located in Mount Joy Township, Lancaster County, near Elizabethtown and southeast of Harrisburg. The academy includes nine buildings on of land.
The facility was originally the State Hospital for Crippled Children, which opened in 1930. In 1991 the corrections department acquired the facility.

No-Ni-Shee Arch

The No-Ni-Shee Arch was a temporary archway near the intersection of Main Street and South Temple in downtown Salt Lake City. The archway was built in 1916 for the Wizard of the Wasatch festival.
"No-Ni-Shee" was the name of a mythical American Indian Salt Princess. Her tears caused the Great Salt Lake to be salty. The arch was dedicated to her and sprayed with salt water so that salt eventually crystallized on Main Street.
Hatumai, the Wizard of the Wasatch, lived with Queen Sirrah in a cavern far up City Creek Canyon, attended by legions of fairies. Hatumai was the great Spirit of the state, who eons ago laid down the precious metals and conditioned the soil to bring forth fruits and flowers. He guarded the Indians and guided the pioneers and miners, and once each year he visited his capital city.
For a clue to Hatumai's identity, read his name backwards. Hatumai was the creation of Fisher Harris, a Virginian who moved to Salt Lake in 1889 and became a notable Utah businessman and booster. Harris announced in 1908 that he had been appointed scribe to the Wizard. He transmitted Hatumai’s orders to the Commercial Club, a social club for businessmen, which, during the carnival season, reorganized itself as the "Wards of the Wizard of the Wasatch". 
The Wizard’s carnivals enlivened Utah’s summers for several years. The last Wizard of the Wasatch carnival was held in 1916, on the eve of World War I.

Zuni phonology

Discussions of Zuni phonology are in Michaels (1971), Newman (1965, 1967, 1996), Shaul (1982), Tedlock (1969), Walker (1966, 1972), and Yumitani (1987).
Consonants.
The 16 consonants of Zuni:
Syllable and phonotactics.
Zuni syllables have the following specification:
That is, all syllables must start with a consonant in the syllable onset. The onset may optionally have two consonants. The syllable coda is optional and may consist of a single consonant or two consonants. There are restrictions on the combinations with long vowels, which are listed below.
"Onset". When the onset is a single consonant (i.e., CV(:), CV(:)C, or CV(:)CC), C1 may be any consonant. When the onset is a two consonant cluster (i.e., CCV(:), CCV(:)C, or CCV(:)CC), C1 may only be , and C2 may only be . These onset clusters can occur word-initially. 
"Nucleus". Any vowel of either length may be the syllable nucleus when open (i.e., has no coda: CV(:) or CCV(:)) or with a single consonant coda (i.e., CV(:)C or CCV(:)C). When the coda consists of two consonant cluster, the nucleus may be any short vowel; however, long vowels only occur with coda consisting of . 
"Coda". A single coda C3 may be any consonant. When the coda is a two consonant cluster (i.e., CV(:)CC or CCV(:)CC), any combination of consonants may occur with the following exception: if C3 is , then C4 can only be either or an identical consonant (C3 = C4).
"Non-tautosyllabic combinations". Inside words, a short vowel plus a two consonant coda (i.e., CVCC or CCVCC) may only be followed by a syllable with a onset. Likewise, a long vowel plus a single consonant coda (i.e., CV:C or CCV:C) may only be followed by a onset. An open syllable (i.e., CV(:) or CCV(:)) and a short vowel plus a single consonant coda (i.e., CVC or CCVC) may be followed by a syllable with any possible onset.
Prosody.
At the word level, the first syllable of lexical words receive stress. Although the acoustic correlates of stress are not fully described in Newman's grammar, at least vowel length is a significant correlate: short vowels are lengthened under syllable-initial stress. Stressed long vowels do not appear to have perceptible variation in duration.
Stress at the phrase level was not fully studied by Newman, and, therefore, its details are not well known. Pronouns and certain particles consisting of a single syllable are unstressed when inside clauses, but are stressed at the beginning of phrases.

Water supply and sanitation in Denmark

Public water supply and sanitation in Denmark is characterized by universal access and generally good service quality. Some salient features of the sector in the Denmark compared to other developed countries are:
Access.
Source: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (2004) 
Access to improved water supply and sanitation in Denmark is universal. It is estimated that 89% of households are connected to the sewer network and 11% are served by on-site sanitation systems such as septic tanks.
Water use and sources.
Total water consumption in Denmark is almost 1000 million m³ per year, which comes entirely from groundwater. This compares to an estimated resource of 1,800 million m³ groundwater per year. About one third is consumed by households, one third by agriculture and market gardens, and one third by industry and institutions. Some industries buy water from the public network, while others pump their own water.
Household water use in Denmark stood at 114 liters/capita/day in 2009. Between 1994 and 2009, household consumption has declined from 50 to 41.4 m3 per person per year. Water savings were caused by new installations (e.g. shower and toilets), water saving campaigns and a higher awareness of the environment among consumers, combined with a rise in the water price.
Quality of service.
The whole population has continuous access to an improved water supply and improved sanitation. A consumer survey by the utility association DANVA in 2006 showed that satisfaction with water suppliers, water quality and security of supply is very high.
According to the European Environment and Health Committee the national microbial failure rate (measured against E. coli) among large water supply systems is generally zero. Very occasionally, large water supply plants have microbiological failures during a limited period. The national chemical failure rate (measured against nitrate ion or against other ions of local importance) among large water supply systems is near zero. In some parts of the country nitrate in drinking water is elevated. About 70,000 families depend on small private water supply systems. The majority of these water supply systems face problems with either nitrate pollution due to extensive agriculture production and/or pollution with pesticides or bacterial contamination. All water supplies, including small private supplies, are under regular control by the local authorities and action is taken if the water quality is poor.
In 2009, the proportion of microbiological tests which complied with legislative requirements was more than 96%. The quality of the drinking water is checked at the waterworks, in the distribution network and at consumers.
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation.
Policy and regulation.
No single Ministry in the government of Denmark is responsible for water supply and sanitation, which is considered foremost a local government responsibility. The Danish Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for environmental policy.
In addition to the central authorities, there are two main levels of authorities responsible for water and wastewater services. There are 5 regional councils and 98 local (municipal) councils in Denmark. The regional councils are responsible for the use and protection of water resources, including extraction permits for large abstractions, and for monitoring the water quality of recipient water bodies (rivers, sea etc.), including authorizations to discharge wastewater. The municipal councils are responsible for the planning, administration and supervision of all water suppliers and the water supply infrastructure. They monitor and enforce compliance with all laws and regulations with regards to water and wastewater provision. The local authorities can issue extraction permits for small abstractions and they also operate a solid system of water quality regulation.
Service provision.
The Danish water supply is highly decentralized, with large and small waterworks situated all over the country. In 2001 there were 2740 “common utilities”, of which municipalities owned 165 and 2575 were owned by consumers' co-operatives. Between 1980 and 2001, the number of utilities has been reduced by 29%. In spite of the high number of utilities, 60% of the drinking water is delivered by municipal utilities which account for only 6% of all utilities. In many cases, thus, municipalities both regulate certain aspects of service provision and provide those same services.
Associations.
The Danish Water and Waste Water Association (DANVA) is a national association of water and waste water utilities. It is a non-profit organization funded by its members, who are utilities, municipalities, consultants, contractors and personal members. Its objective “is to look after the common interests of Danish water and sewerage suppliers in promoting a steady and high-quality water and sewerage supply on an environmentally sustainable basis.” DANVA was formed in 2002 as a merger of the two associations, the Danish Water Supply Association and the Danish Wastewater Association
Benchmarking.
The Danish water sector has carried out voluntary benchmarking surveys since 1999 in order to help service providers to improve their efficiency. The project is more than just a comparison of key indicators (performance benchmarking). It includes also process benchmarking, the setting of service goals and the development of a default chart of accounts. The project is financially independent through the payment of fees by participating utilities. It is estimated that around DK 15 million (US$ 3.15m) will have been spent on benchmarking by 2009. The Danish benchmarking project is part of a North European benchmarking cooperation (NEBC) initiated in 2004 by the national water associations and several water utilities of Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden with the support of the International Water Association. It builds on the pioneering efforts of the Netherlands in this field.
In 2003 the Danish government undertook a “service check” which estimated a potential for efficiency improvements worth DK 1.3 billion (US$ 273m) annually. Indeed, between 2002 and 2006 utilities participating in the benchmarking project were able to achieve annual savings of DK 450 million (US$ 94.5m) in operations and maintenance without any reduction of service quality or harm to the environment. The utility association DANVA attributes these savings to lessons that utilities drew from its benchmarking system. The exact source of the savings remains a bit unclear. The savings were not achieved in energy efficiency, since the specific energy consumption actually increased from 2 kWh/m3 in 2002 to 2.3 kWh/m3 in 2006. Neither were they achieved in reducing water losses, which hovered around the very low level of 6% during this period.
Financial aspects.
Cost recovery.
Danish legislation requires full cost recovery for both water supply and sanitation (break-even principle).
Tariffs.
In 2009, the average price for water and wastewater including taxes (VAT and green taxes) was DKK 52.30/m³ (US$ 8.36) – one of the highest tariffs in the EU. It consists of 24% for water, 48% for wastewater and 30% for taxes. The total price of water measured in fixed prices has increased by 32% between 1996 and 2006. Nevertheless, a household’s average expenditures for tap water and wastewater accounted for only about 0.13% of its total income. This share has remained constant, mainly because water consumption declined while tariffs increased. Water prices vary a lot from one supplier to another depending on costs. The connection fee of a normal city one-family house was DKK 12,191 in 2001, varying from DKK 0 to 24,735. 
According to a 2006 survey by NUS consulting the average water tariff (price) without sewerage for large (commercial) consumers using 10,000 cubic meters per year in Denmark was the equivalent of US$ 2.24 per cubic meter. This was the highest tariff among the 14 mostly OECD countries covered by the report.
Investment.
Investments stood at DKK 4.03 per m3 in 2009.
Efficiency.
There is a huge span between the lowest and the highest operating and maintenance costs for water supply in Denmark, varying from DKK 2 to DKK 13 per cubic meter (without wastewater and taxes). This suggests that there is still scope for realizing savings. These differences are determined by structural differences (such as depth of groundwater table and location of wells from consumption centers) and politically determined differences (such as pipe replacement policies and the extent of efforts going into groundwater protection).
Water losses accounted for 7% of production in 2009, or 1.6 m3 per km of pipe and day. This is about the same level as in the Netherlands, but much higher than in Scotland, England and Wales or Australia, according to figures by the British water regulator OFWAT quoted by DANVA. Water losses have declined from 3.4 m³/km/day in 1992. Suppliers must pay a tax in the event of water losses in excess of 10% as an incentive to reduce water loss.

Mythomoteur

A mythomoteur (compound of the French words for myth and engine) is the constitutive myth that gives an ethnic group its sense of purpose. The term was first used in this context by Ramon d’Abadal i de Vinyals, and was later taken up by John Armstrong in his book "Nations before Nationalism". It has subsequently become a common theme in Anthony D. Smith’s work on ethnicity and nationalism, particularly his book "The Ethnic Origins of Nations". Three types of mythomoteur have been identified, the communal-political, the communal-religious, and the dynastic.

Apis cerana indica

Apis cerana indica is a subspecies of honey bee. "A. c. indica" is one of the important pollinating agents for coconut palms; the other species are: "Apis florea", "Apis dorsata" and "Apis mellifera" (the European bee).
Apis cerana (Indian honeybees)
Apis cerana is a subspecies of honeybees, there are two subspecies of "A.Cerana" which are "Apis cerana cerana" and "Apis cerana indica", these species are similar to "Apis mellifera", and "A.mellifera" tends to be slightly larger than A.cerana and can be readily distinguish them. A. cerana is one of the predominant species found and domesticated in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand and mainland Asia. These are less aggressive than any wild bees and also less swarming behavior and can be easily used for beekeeping.
They are also called Eastern honeybees/Indian honeybees. They usually build multiple combs nest in some tree hallows and some man made structures. These bees can adapted to living in cavities in some human structures and in purpose-made hives, and their nesting habit means that they can potentially colonize temperate or mountain areas with prolonged winters or cold temperatures.

Portadown Massacre

The Portadown Massacre took place in November 1641 at what is now Portadown, County Armagh. Up to 100 mostly Protestants were killed in the River Bann by a group of armed Catholics. This was the biggest individual massacre of Protestants during the 1641–42 uprising.
The Massacre.
The rebellion had broken out in October 1641 and was marked by attacks by dispossessed native Irish on the English and Scottish Protestant settlers who had arrived in Ulster in the Ulster Plantation about 30 years earlier. At first, there were beatings and robbing of local settlers who lived on land taken from the Irish Catholics by force of arms, then house burnings and expulsions and finally killings. By November 1641, armed parties of Ulstermen were rounding up British Protestant settlers and marching them to the coast, from which they were forced to board ships to Britain.
Historian Nicholas Canny suggests that the violence escalated after a failed rebel assault on Lisnagarvey in November 1641, after which the settlers killed several hundred captured insurgents. Canny writes, 'the bloody mindedness of the settlers in taking revenge when they gained the upper hand in battle seems to have made such a deep impression on the insurgents that, as one deponent put it, "the slaughter of the English" could be dated from this encounter'.
One such a group of Protestants were imprisoned in a church in Loughall. They had been informed that they were going to be marched eastwards where they were to be expelled to England. The Irish soldiers were said by to be led by either Captain Manus O'Cane or Toole McCann – later accounts of the event differed on this point. After some time, the English civilians were taken out of the Church and marched to a bridge over the River Bann. Once on the bridge, the group was stopped. At this point the civilians, threatened by pikes and swords, were forcibly stripped of their clothes. They were then herded off the bridge into the icy cold river waters at swordpoint. Most drowned or died of exposure, although some were said to have been shot by musket-fire as they struggled to stay afloat. Estimates of the number of those killed varied from less than 100 to over 300. William Clarke, a survivor of the massacre, said during the 1642 depositions that as many as 100 were killed at the bridge. As Clarke was a witness of the massacre his figure is taken as being the most credible.
Aftermath.
The total of Protestant civilians killed in Ulster in the early months of the rebellion was about 4,000. In County Armagh, recent research has shown that about 1,250 Protestants were killed or about 25 percent of the planter population there. In County Tyrone, modern research has identified three blackspots for the killing of settlers, with the worst being near Kinard, County Tyrone, "where most of the British families planted ... were ultimately murdered.".
The massacre was used to support the view that the Uprising was a papal conspiracy to massacre Protestant inhabitants of Ireland, though in truth large scale massacres such as this were mostly confined to Ulster. The atrocity featured prominently in Parliamentarian writing in the 1640s, most famously by John Temple's "The Irish Rebellion" (1646). The immediate goal was to isolate King Charles, whom many prominent English Protestants such as John Pym, viewed as being sympathetic to Irish Catholics. 
In the longer term, accounts of the massacre strengthened the resolve of many Parliamentarians to launch a reconquest of Ireland, which they did in 1649. Temple's work was published at least ten times between 1646 and 1812. – the graphic massacres depicted therein were frequently used as a justification for the Penal Laws. There were massacres of local Catholics, such as at Islandmagee in County Antrim, and on Rathlin Island where Covenanter Campbell soldiers of the Argyll's Foot were encouraged by their commanding officer Sir Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck to kill the local Catholic MacDonalds, near relatives of their arch Clan enemy in the Scottish Highlands Clan MacDonald, several hundred were killed. William Lecky, the 19th century historian of the 1641 rebellion, concluded that, "it is far from clear on which side the balance of cruelty rests".

William H.T. Walker

William Henry Talbot Walker (November 26, 1816 – July 22, 1864) was an American soldier. He was a career United States Army officer who fought with distinction during the Mexican-American War, and also served as a Confederate general during the American Civil War. Walker was severely wounded many times in combat, and was killed in action during the 1864 Atlanta Campaign.
Early life and career.
William Henry Talbot Walker (often styled as William H.T. or W.H.T. Walker to distinguish him from the other two William Walkers in the Confederate Army) was born in Augusta, Georgia in 1816. He was a son of Freeman Walker (a U.S. Senator and Augusta mayor) and his wife Mary Garlington Creswell; however his father died in 1827 when he was eleven years old. Walker then received his early education at Augusta's Richmond Academy. He would have four children with his wife Mary Townsend, two sons and two daughters.
Walker entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1832, and graduated four years later, standing 46th out of 59 cadets. Walker was appointed a brevet second lieutenant on July 1, 1837, and assigned to the 6th U.S. Infantry. On July 31 he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. That winter he was serving in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, where he was seriously wounded on December 25 in the neck, shoulder, chest, left arm, and also his leg. Walker was appointed a brevet first lieutenant to rank from that day as well. He was promoted to first lieutenant on February 1, 1838, and would resign his commission on October 31 of that year.
Walker was reinstated in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant on November 18, 1840, to rank from his last promotion in early 1838. He was again assigned to the 6th U.S. Infantry, and was promoted to captain on November 7, 1845. 
During the Mexican-American War, he fought at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco, both in August 1847. While engaged at Churubusco he was again wounded, and his performance there combined with his actions at Contreras won him brevet to the rank of major on August 20. Walker then participated in the Battle of Molino del Rey in early September and was once more wounded, this time in the back. For his actions there he was made a brevet lieutenant colonel on September 8.
After the war with Mexico concluded, Walker was on recruiting duty for the U.S. Army from 1849 to 1852. Walker served as commandant of the cadets at West Point from July 31, 1854, to May 22, 1856. Also during his time at West Point he taught military tactics and was promoted to major in the 10th U.S. Infantry on March 3, 1855. His nickname of "Shot Pouch" was due to his multiple woundings.
Civil War service.
With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Walker chose to follow his home state of Georgia and the Confederate cause. He resigned his commission on December 20, 1860, and was appointed a colonel in the Georgia State Militia on February 1, 1861. He would hold this position until March 13, when he was appointed a major general in the 1st Division, Georgia Militia, until May.
Walker transferred to the Confederate Army infantry as a colonel on April 25. He was promoted to brigadier general on May 25 and assigned the 1st brigade, 4th Division of the Potomac District of the Department of Northern Virginia on October 22. Seven days later he resigned his commission, either due to his health or from being dissatisfied with his assignments for the Confederacy. Almost immediately after resigning, Walker served in the Georgia militia again as a brigadier general from November 1861 to January 1863, when he resigned to re-enter the Confederate States Army.
Walker resumed his brigadier general rank in the Confederate Army on February 9, 1863, and in May was assigned to brigade command to the Confederate Department of the West. On May 21 he was given divisional command in the same department, and he was promoted to major general on May 23. This promotion was strongly endorsed by the department's commander, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, who considered Walker "the only officer in his command competent to lead a division." Walker then participated in the Vicksburg Campaign that summer in Johnston's command. Walker and his division were transferred to the Department of Mississippi & Eastern Louisiana in July and served there until August 23, when his command was added to the Reserve Corps of the Army of Tennessee until November 4. During this time Walker fought in the Confederate victory at the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia that September as commander of that corps.
In December 1863, Walker and his division were made part of Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's First Corps of the Army of Tennessee. He would command it up to his death in combat on July 22, 1864 at the Battle of Atlanta, when he was shot from his horse by a Federal picket, killing him instantly, and Brig. Gen. Hugh W. Mercer took over the division. Walker is buried in the Walker Cemetery, located at Augusta College in Georgia.
In memory.
An upturned cannon waymark in the Glenwood Triangle of Atlanta currently marks the place where Walker was killed. Its front description plate reads: " In memory of Maj.Gen. William H.T. Walker, C.S.A." and the rear plate reads: "Born November 26, 1816; killed on this spot July 22, 1864." A bronze bust of Walker was dedicated in 1916, made by American sculptor Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson, and is located at Vicksburg National Military Park.
Fort Walker, also in Atlanta, is named in his honor.

Sweet & Lowdown is an album by folk musician and singer Dave Van Ronk, released in 2001. In this album, Van Ronk returns to recording pop and jazz standards.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Travis Dageset wrote of the album "The tunes swing along with Van Ronk's mildly Louis Armstrong-flavored rasp, which holds up throughout... for the most part, this is indispensable Van Ronk, whose forte, apart from his gift for songwriting, has always been classic interpretation that contains as much of his own distinct personality as it does respect for whatever form of American music he is delving into."

Tritia Toyota

Tritia Toyota (born March 29, 1947) is a former Los Angeles television news anchor and a current adjunct assistant professor in anthropology, Asian-American studies and the media at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Early life and education.
Born in Portland, Oregon, Toyota earned a master's degree in journalism from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1970 and later earned a PhD in anthropology. Toyota's real name is Letritia R. Miyake.
Professional career.
Toyota began her broadcast career in Los Angeles in 1970 as a radio reporter with KNX-AM. In January 1972 she was hired as a general assignment reporter at KNBC-TV; she became a news anchor there in 1975. Toyota quit KNBC in March 1985 and, after a standard three-month period between contracts, signed on as a news anchor at KCBS-TV.
On November 17, 1999, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that Toyota had left KCBS and that she previously had been removed from early morning and noon newscasts in September and October 1999. The story also reported that Toyota had been offered an opportunity to continue at the station and that she had declined.
Personal life.
Toyota is married to lawyer Michael R. Yamaki and lives in Los Angeles' Brentwood area. She met her husband while they were both students at UCLA in the early 1970s.
Cultural Influences.
Los Angeles punk rock band The Dickies recorded a song called "(I'm Stuck in a Pagoda with) Tricia Toyota." It is unclear whether the misspelling of Toyota's first name was deliberate or accidental.
Toyota is also mentioned in "The L.A. Song," a song by L.A. hip-hop group People Under The Stairs, from their 2002 album "O.S.T.".
The TV news reporter character Tricia Takanawa on "Family Guy" may have been inspired at least in part by Toyota; KTTV Fox 11 reporter Tricia Takasugi has also been suggested as a source for the character.

<doc id="18339165" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18339165" title="Boulevards of Paris">
Boulevards of Paris

Boulevards of Paris are boulevards which form an important part of the urban landscape of Paris. The boulevards were constructed in several phases by central government initiative as infrastructure improvements, but are very much associated with strolling and leisurely enjoyment in the minds of Parisians.
Parisian boulevards and avenues are usually tree-lined on one or both sides, which is rarely the case for smaller roads.
The "grands boulevards".
The "Grands Boulevards" are essentially 'the best' of the Parisian boulevards. They correspond to the "Nouveau Cours" built between 1668 and 1705 in place of the dismantled Louis XIII wall. The boulevards of Louis XIV were conceived by Pierre Bullet to link the Porte Saint-Antoine (situated where the place de la Bastille now stands) to the Porte Saint-Honoré (situated where the Place de la Madeleine now stands).
Which ones exactly are classed amongst the Grands Boulevards is somewhat unclear. Many Parisians would automatically include Boulevard Haussmann amongst them, as the large department stores (Printemps and Galeries Lafayette) draw promenaders in the "boulevardier spirit". However, strictly speaking, "les Grands Boulevards" would only include the Boulevard Beaumarchais, Filles-du-Calvaire, Temple, Saint-Martin, Saint-Denis, Bonne-Nouvelle, Poissonnière, Montmartre, Italiens, Capucines and the Madeleine boulevards.
Parisians made the boulevards into promenades which have remained popular through the ages and changes in the city. They were the setting for Maupassant's "Bel Ami"; Fred Astaire took to the boulevards in "Funny Face" (1957). The later opening of other trunk roads, namely Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, Boulevard Haussmann, and Avenue de la République, has somewhat reduced the visibility of the Grand Boulevards and the Louis XIII wall in the Paris topography.
""Boulevard du Crime"".
The idea of the boulevard as a centre for leisure asserted itself during the 18th century, when numerous théâtres de la foire set up near the Porte Saint-Martin. The boulevard du Temple became affectionately known as ""boulevard du Crime"" during Bourbon Restoration, an allusion to the criminal acts portrayed there by stage actors. According to the "Almanach des Spectacles", "Tautin was stabbed 16,302 times, Marti poisoned 11,000 times, Fresnoy set on fire 27,000 times in countless ways..., Mademoiselle Adèle Dupuis was seduced, kidnapped or drowned 75,000 times".
Although the "boulevard du Crime" fell victim to Haussmann's transformation, the "boulevardier" spirit lives on in « théâtre de boulevard ».
Haussmannian boulevards.
From 1784 to 1791, Ledoux built the Wall of the Farmers-General, with boulevards running along its exterior. This wall built to collect the octroi, a tax on goods entering the city which was hated by Parisians. It was demolished approximately between 1789 and 1860. Although it was almost completely razed by Haussman in 1860 as part of his transformation of Paris, some parts remain. The surviving boulevards were subject to urban planners' failed attempts in the 1950s to transform them into urban freeways.
Haussmann's renovation of Paris brought the boulevard to the heart of Paris, whereas they had hitherto fore been limited to uninhabited or sparsely inhabited zones. Le boulevard, whose initial function was to go around the capital, became structural urban thoroughfares.
The boulevards from Haussmann and before now define Paris, with uniform façades and overhanging balconies stretching along them. These are immediately recognisable, and are under the strict control of Paris' urban planners.
The "boulevards des Maréchaux".
The demolition of the "Thiers wall" during the 1920s allowed for the creation of a third ring of boulevards surrounding the city. These boulevards were named after the Marshals of the Empire, and, in consequence, they are called the "Boulevards des Maréchaux" (Boulevards of the Marshals). They run just inside the city limits.
In addition, the Boulevard périphérique, the beltway surrounding Paris, was built on the site of the ruins of the Thiers wall, a short distance 'outboard' from the boulevards of the marshals. However, it is more like a motorway than a boulevard. Paris Tramway Line 3 has been running along the "Boulevards des Maréchaux" since December 2006.

Hogarth Painting the Comic Muse

Hogarth Painting the Comic Muse (originally known as The Artist Painting the Comic Muse) is a painting in the National Portrait Gallery, London by the British artist William Hogarth. It was painted in approximately 1757 and published as a print in etching and engraving in 1758, with its final and sixth state in 1764. Hogarth used this particular self-portrait as the frontispiece of his collected engravings, published in 1764.
The painting depicts Hogarth himself painting the Muse of Comedy, which represented artistic inspiration. Hogarth's decision to paint this particular figure may relate to his artistic motto: "my picture was my stage and men and women my actors", as the Comic Muse was said to provide inspiration for playwrights. Seated in front of his easel, palette in hand, Hogarth eagerly works at his painting; Hogarth expressly wanted a self-portrait in which he was depicted in the middle of painting a piece, rather than in a static pose. Leaning against the right leg of the easel is Hogarth's "The Analysis of Beauty", a text which was written to complement this particular piece. X-ray analysis shows that the painting originally had a small dog relieving himself on a pile of old master paintings.
The print of "Hogarth Painting the Comic Muse" went through several alterations mostly relating to the inscription at the bottom of the page. In the second state, the inscription read: "Wm Hogarth Sergeant Painter to His Majesty. The Face Engrav'd by Wm Hogarth and Publish'd as the Act directs". The third state omits "and", while adding "March 29, 1758" to the end. The fourth state omits "The Face Engrav'd by Wm Hogarth". In the fifth state, "Sergeant Painter" is scratched out, while changes have now also been made to the engraving itself; the Muse's face is now marked with black and on the pillar she stands beside is inscribed "Comedy 1764". The sixth state, which is depicted on the right, has nothing inscribed on it but "William Hogarth, 1764" on the bottom.
Through this engraving, the early Georgian elbow chair in which Hogarth is shown sitting gave rise in the late nineteenth century to the collectors' and dealers' designation of "Hogarth chair" for similar bended-back elbow chairs with vase-shaped splats, slip seats (upholstered over a drop-in frame) and cabriole legs on pad feet. Such chairs from the American colonies are designated "Queen Anne chairs", perpetuating an early error in dating them.

Hasmukhbhai Parekh

Hasmukhbhai Parekh (born March 10, 1911) (died 1994) was an Indian financial entrepreneur, writer, and philanthropist. He played a role in the development of Industrial Credit & Investment Corporation of India, now ICICI Bank, founded the Housing Development Finance Corporation, and in 1992 was awarded the Padma Bhushan for his contribution to the finance industry in India. The London School of Economics also conferred on him an honorary fellowship.
Biography.
Hasmukhbhai Parekh belonged to a Gujarati vaishnav-Bania family from Surat, Gujarat. During his early life he lived in a chawl with his father, Thakurdas, and had to juggle a part-time job and studies with the London School of Economics. He subsequently worked as a lecturer at St. Xavier's College, Bombay, for three years, and later began his financial career with the stock broking firm Harkisandass Lukhmidass. He joined ICICI as Deputy General Manager in 1956, became Chairman & Managing Director in 1972. He retired in 1976 and was Chairman of ICICI's Board until 1978.
At 68, when he had already received many honours and was stepping down from ICICI, he started a new institution, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the first of its kind for housing finance in India. On meeting the then Secretary of Finance, Dr Manmohan Singh, the latter told him that HDFC was an unknown venture and that no one knew if it would "click" with the Indian people, but Hasmukhbhai Parekh had by then already obtained promises of funding from overseas investors, and he was enthusiastic about the project.

Juxia

Juxia is an extinct genus of indricothere, a group of herbivorous mammals that are part of the odd-toed ungulate family tree of rhinoceros and tapirs. "Juxia" was in the size of a horse. It lived in Asia during the upper Eocene. As an early indricothere, Juxia had a relatively light body, held by elongated long legs and small skull firmly attached to a relatively long neck. Based on its triangular like teeth and sharp protruding incisors, Juxia was probably a strict browser, feeding on ferns and leaves on branches where most herbivorous mammals couldn't reach. In terms of habitat, Juxia lived in densely lush and tropical forests of what is now China. Though a few skeletons have been found, it is unclear whether this early indricothere was permanently solitary or lived in small social groups, possibly harems. Based on its morphology, Juxia's long legs probably enabled it to run relatively fast for a limited duration. This was probably a defense mechanism against early mammalian predators.

1974–75 Chicago Black Hawks season

The 1974–75 Chicago Black Hawks season was the Hawks' forty-ninth season in the NHL, and the club was coming off a 41-14-23 record in 1973-74, earning 105 points, and finishing in second place in the West Division. The Black Hawks defeated the Los Angeles Kings in the NHL quarter-finals, but lost to the Boston Bruins in the semi-finals.
During the off-season, the NHL made a number of changes. The league expanded by two more teams, as the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals joined the league, making the NHL an 18 team league. The schedule was then bumped up from 78 games to 80, and the previously two division league was split into two conferences and four divisions. The Black Hawks found themselves in the newly created Smythe Division with the Minnesota North Stars, St. Louis Blues, Vancouver Canucks, and the expansion team Kansas City Scouts. The Smythe Division was part of the newly created Campbell Conference.
Chicago began the regular season with a strong 7-3-1 in their first eleven games, however, the team fell into a slump, and found themselves under the .500 level 26 games into the season with a record of 11-12-3. The Black Hawks would continue to hover around .500 for the rest of the season, and eventually finish the year with a 37-35-8 record, earning 82 points. Chicago's 37 victories and 82 points were their lowest totals since the 1968-69 season, while their 35 losses was the most since the team lost 39 in 1957-58. The team finished in third place in the Smythe Division, and earn a spot in the post-season as the eleventh seed.
Offensively, the Black Hawks were led by Stan Mikita, who led the club with 36 goals, 50 assists and 86 points. Jim Pappin tied Mikita with 36 goals, and added 27 assists for 63 points. Newly acquired Ivan Boldirev, who spent the previous season with the California Golden Seals, stepped in and finished second in team scoring with 67 points, as he recorded 23 goals and 44 assists. Cliff Koroll had a strong season, scoring 27 goals and 59 points, while defenseman Dick Redmond led the blueline with 14 goals and 57 points. John Marks led the Black Hawks with a +27 rating, while Phil Russell had a team high 260 penalty minutes.
In goal, Tony Esposito once again led the club with 34 victories and a 2.74 GAA, earning six shutouts in 71 games.
The Hawks opened the playoffs against the fifth seeded Boston Bruins in a best of three preliminary round. The Bruins finished the season with a 40-26-14 record, earning 94 points, and a second place finish in the Adams Division. The series opened with a game at the Boston Garden, and the heavily favored Bruins easily disposed the Black Hawks by a score of 8-2. The series moved to Chicago Stadium for the next game, and the Hawks responded, with a 4-3 overtime victory, to set up a third and final game back in Boston. Chicago would complete the upset, stunning the Bruins by a score of 6-4 in the third game, to advance to the NHL quarter-finals.
Chicago's next opponent in a best of seven series was the second seeded Buffalo Sabres, who had a record of 49-16-15, earning 113 points, and a first place finish in the Adams Division. The series started with two games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The Sabres used their home ice advantage, and quickly took a 2-0 series lead with wins of 4-1 and 3-1. The series moved to Chicago for the next two games, and the Hawks cut into the Sabres lead with a 5-4 overtime win in the third game. Buffalo responded in the fourth game though, as they cruised to a 6-2 win. The Sabres closed out the series in the fifth game back in Buffalo, winning the game 3-1.
Draft picks.
Chicago's draft picks at the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft held via conference call at the NHL office in Montreal, Quebec.

Keith Miller in the 1946–47 Australian cricket season

During the 1946–47 Australian cricket season, all rounder Keith Miller represented Victoria and Australia. A 27-year-old right-handed batsman and fast bowler, Miller played in all five Tests against England, performing well with both bat and ball. He finished top of the Australian Test bowling averages, taking 16 wickets at 20.88, and was second in the batting averages, scoring 384 runs at 76.80. On his Ashes debut in the First Test in Brisbane, Miller scored 79 before taking match bowling figures of 9 wickets for 77 runs (9/77) in Australia's innings victory. In the Fourth Test, played at the Adelaide Oval, Miller broke through for his first Test century, scoring an unbeaten 141. A middle-order batsman and right-arm opening bowler, Miller finished the Test series as Australia's joint leading wicket-taker, along with his new ball partner Ray Lindwall, as Australia won the series 3–0.
Miller also played a key role in Victoria's Sheffield Shield triumph, scoring 667 runs for the State in four matches, all of which were won, at an average of 133.40. Miller scored 188 against South Australia, before making 153 and 206 not out, both at high tempo as Victoria twice defeated arch-rivals New South Wales.
Off the field, Miller was dogged by speculation as to whether he would honour a contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the English Lancashire League, which would have ended his Test career. Miller resolved that he would remain in Australia, and accepted a job offer in New South Wales, but kept his decision private.
Background.
Miller had made his first-class debut for Victoria before World War II as a specialist batsman not known for aggressive play. After the outbreak of war, Miller was deployed to England as a Royal Australian Air Force fighter pilot, flying in combat missions. While playing for military teams, he began to bowl more often, and was selected for Australian Services cricket team, a military outfit, to play in the Victory Tests against a full-strength England. During this series, Miller gained prominence with a series of hard-hitting displays and some rapid fast bowling against established Test batsmen such as Len Hutton. Miller topped the batting averages and took ten wickets and was hailed for his attacking play. He went on to make his Test debut in March 1946 in a one-off match against New Zealand, but this fixture was not given Test status until 1948. The 1946–47 Test series against the touring Englishmen would be his first against a major team, and Miller was expected to play a prominent role with both bat and ball, especially in countering the visitors' powerful batting.
Early season.
During the southern hemisphere winter of 1946, Miller had travelled to Boston, Massachusetts to marry Peg Wagner, whom he met during a stopover early in 1943 on the way to military service in the United Kingdom. After the wedding, the couple travelled back to Melbourne to start their married life.
Miller had only been back in Australia for a week when he faced Wally Hammond's visiting English team in the touring side's match against Victoria. His fielding and batting were rusty after the long layoff, and the media constantly probed him about the contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the Lancashire League a few months earlier, to start in 1947. Miller said nothing in the press, but the Victorian Cricket Association made public appeals for an employer to give Miller a job so that he would not leave the state and become a professional sportsman in England. In the match against Hammond's men, Miller struggled while scoring 32 in the first innings before being dismissed by leg spinner Doug Wright. In the Victorian second innings he was bowled by James Langridge for eight. Victorian captain Lindsay Hassett was not willing to ask Miller to bowl, given his lack of thorough preparation for the season; the tourists won the match by 244 runs.
Miller was selected for an Australian XI—a team comprising a mix of established international representatives and fringe players—fixture against the tourists prior to the Test series, but made only five runs with the bat and bowled only four overs, taking 0/8 in a rain-affected match that did not reach the second innings. In a Shield match against South Australia—led by national captain Don Bradman—at the Adelaide Oval, Miller had a chance to push for selection by performing well in front of the Australian captain, who was also a member of the three-man national selection panel.
Miller took 2/32 in 11 overs, bowling both of his victims as the hosts were dismissed for 270 on the first day. The Victorian paceman also had a chance to bowl at Bradman—who made a hundred—for a period. On the second day, Miller came to the crease at 2/171 to join Ken Meuleman after the openers had laid the platform with an opening stand of 158 runs. The pair added 26 runs before Meuleman fell at 3/197 and was replaced by Hassett. The pair batted until the end of the day as Victoria reached 3/285 at stumps to take first innings points, with Miller on 56 and Hassett 43. The next day, they continued to 188 and 114 respectively, their 224-run partnership ending when Phil Ridings bowled Hassett. This precipitated a collapse of 7/39 as Victoria finished at 548. Amid the visitors' faltering innings, it had taken a run out to remove Miller.
Miller used a wide array of strokes, leading "The Advertiser" of Adelaide to describe his innings as "dashing and colourful". "Wisden" said Miller's innings was "one of the finest batting displays ever seen at Adelaide". Due to the presence of Bradman, who was known for his ruthless and calculated attitude, Miller suppressed his carefree nature and played in a conservative and measured way, hoping to impress his prospective captain. After his long innings, Hassett asked Miller to only bowl two overs in the second innings, and Victoria were left needing 79 runs in 35 minutes for victory after the hosts were dismissed for 356. With a series of fours and quick singles, Miller and Hassett guided the visitors to the target in just 63 balls, with five minutes to spare. Miller was dismissed for 33 in the final over, just before the Victorians completed the chase.
Bradman saw Miller as a top-order batsman and as his new ball partner for Lindwall, although the Victorian allrounder was a reluctant bowler. The Australian captain felt that Miller was crucial to his strategy of attacking England's strong batting line-up—which boasted the likes of Hammond, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich and Cyril Washbrook—with high pace. Miller was duly selected for the Australian team for the First Test.
First Test.
Miller made his Ashes debut in the First Test in Brisbane the day after his 27th birthday. Miller was slated to bat at No. 5 and Bradman fielded six front-line bowlers, but this did not weaken the batting, as four of the bowlers, Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool and Ian Johnson, had all scored centuries in first-class cricket. Australia batted first but Miller was not needed until day two, coming in to join Hassett after Bradman was dismissed for 187 with the score at 3/322. Miller was asleep when Bradman fell, but roused himself and played aggressively to reach his half-century in just 80 minutes before lunch. He struck one six onto the roof of the members' stand at long-on, the biggest hit at the ground at the time. Miller's 106-run partnership with Hassett ended when Alec Bedser removed the latter caught at mid-on, having already been dropped four times. After the lunch break, Miller slowed down and was eventually trapped leg before wicket (lbw) by leg spinner Doug Wright, ending his first Ashes innings at 79, having taken 80 minutes to score his last 29 runs. During the course of his innings, which Australian cricket writer Johnnie Moyes described as "attractive and stately", Miller passed 3,000 runs at first-class level. Australia reached 645 on the third day, a national record against England at home, before a tropical storm hit, complete with hailstones as large as golf balls. The tourists were very unaccustomed to such weather and were extremely disturbed by the noisy downpour. Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first Ashes wicket, bowling Hutton after testing him with a series of bouncers as England closed at 1/21.
During that first Test, an incident occurred, coloured by Miller's wartime service, that soured his relationship with Bradman and his feelings towards Test cricket. Michael Parkinson described it as follows:
Keith Miller was deeply affected by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... Bill Edrich came in. He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman came up to me and said, 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never felt the same way about it after that.'
The following day, the pitch dried out under the hot sun and turned into a sticky wicket. Miller bowled at a mixture of pace and off breaks and added a large amount of bouncers, leading former Australian Test batsmen and journalist Jack Fingleton to compare the amount of high-paced short-pitched bowling by the Australian pair to that during "Bodyline". On the uneven surface, Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body. Miller cut down the English top-order, removing Washbrook, Compton, Edrich and Jack Ikin on the fourth morning to leave England at 5/56. After removing Washbrook, caught by Sid Barnes with only four more runs added to the overnight total, Miller trapped Compton lbw for 17, leaving England at 3/49. After having Edrich caught in the slips by Colin McCool, Miller removed Ikin first-ball, caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon to be on a hat-trick, but Norman Yardley prevented him from taking a third wicket in as many balls. After Hammond and Yardley stabilised the innings with a 61-run partnership, Miller later returned to remove wicket-keeper Paul Gibb and his replacement Bedser in consecutive balls, but last man Wright successfully thwarted Miller's second hat-trick attempt. The Victorian paceman finished with 7/60, his first five-wicket haul at first-class level.
England made 141 and Bradman forced them to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He combined with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets in the space of 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.
Second Test.
A fortnight later, Miller proceeded to the Second Test in Sydney, where he had a quiet match without his partner Lindwall, who was sidelined with chickenpox. England batted first and Miller opened the bowling with Victorian teammate and debutant Fred Freer. Miller bowled nine overs without success, conceding 24 runs as Hammond's tourists amassed 270. On a turning surface, nine of the English wickets fell to the spinners Johnson and McCool. In the hosts' reply, Miller contributed 40 with seven fours in a 63-run stand with Barnes as Australia reached 4/159. Bradman—who had dropped himself down the order—and Barnes then both scored 234 and put together a world record fifth-wicket partnership of 405 to propel Australia to 8/659 declared. Miller bowled 11 overs in the second innings, taking the wicket of Hutton who was out hit wicket after going on a short-lived attack that yielded 37 runs from 39 balls in 24 minutes. Hutton shaped to drive the last ball before lunch, and successfully made contact, but in following through, his bat slipped from his hand and clipped the stumps. Miller had a light bowling workload as Johnson and McCool took seven wickets between them for the innings and eight wickets each for the match as Australia completed another innings victory.
Miller saved his best batting for the Shield clash with arch-rivals New South Wales, which started on Boxing Day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The visitors batted first and made 205, Miller taking 2/22 from ten overs. He then came to the crease on the first afternoon with Victoria at 1/31 after Meuleman was dismissed. Miller hammered three sixes from one over against Test team-mate Ernie Toshack, having started the over on three runs. After measuring up Toshack's bowling for the first two balls, Miller hooked the third ball over fine leg for six. He then lifted the sixth ball over square leg, was dropped by the bowler on the seventh ball, before driving the last ball into the crowd at long on. Miller reached his fifty in 41 minutes and was 79 at the close of play, with Victoria on 1/154. The next day, he fell for 153, ending a 271-run partnership with Merv Harvey that took just over three hours. It took another run out to terminate Miller's innings at 2/302. Miller's childhood hero Bill Ponsford said that Miller's display was the hardest hitting he had ever seen. The "Sun-Pictorial" opined that "the M.C.G. seemed to shrink in size. It was reported that each time Keith shaped to Toshack the crowd in the boundary seats ducked." Victoria declared at 8/560, Test teammates Lindwall and Toshack taking the most punishment with figures of 1/100 and 0/133 from 18 and 21 overs respectively. Miller then took 1/41—his 50th first-class wicket—and a catch as Victoria won by an innings and 114 runs.
Third Test.
The Third Test was Miller's first in his home town, and he produced a quiet performance in a drawn match. He scored 33 before being caught behind by Godfrey Evans from the bowling of Wright as Australia stumbled and lost three wickets in four runs to be 6/192; the hosts recovered to reach 365 in the first innings. Miller then bowled ten wicketless overs for 34 and caught Ikin from the leg spin of Bruce Dooland in England's reply of 351. Miller then scored 34 as Australia set England 551 to win in seven hours. Miller then took 2/41 in the second innings, removing Ikin and Bedser during a spell in tandem with Lindwall late on the final day that was punctuated by frequent bouncers. Miller also ran out Compton, but England held on for a draw with three wickets intact.
Miller then played for Tasmania Combined XI—which consisted mainly of Victorians—against Hammond's tourists in Hobart. He scored 70 and 30, opening in the second innings, and took a wicket in each innings, removing Evans and Ikin as the match ended in a draw. This was followed by a match against Queensland in Brisbane in which Miller scored 81 batting at No. 3, featuring in a 93-run stand with Meuleman as Victoria amassed 466. He then took 3/21 in the hosts' first innings, removing opener Geoff Cook before returning late in the innings to take two of the last three wickets. Hassett asked the Queenslanders to follow on and Miller took 1/20 and two catches as the hosts were defeated by an innings and 13 runs. Miller had a light workload with the ball as Hassett asked him to deliver only 15.4 eight-ball overs.
Miller made another famous century in the return Sheffield Shield match against arch-rivals New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Miller had a lean time with the bat in the first innings, being dismissed for six as Hassett's tourists made 356. He was then punished as the New South Welshmen amassed 79 runs from his 14 overs, taking only the wicket of Ginty Lush as the hosts replied with 329. Miller came to the crease at 2/118 after 100 minutes on the third morning, with brothers Merv and Neil Harvey back in the pavilion. Miller combined with Ian Johnson (82) in a 126-run partnership, before sharing an unbroken 206-run stand with Meuleman. By stumps, 232 minutes after he came to the crease, Miller had reached 206 not out, and Victoria declared at 3/450. Miller struck 15 fours and three sixes in a strident attack on the bowling. His first six was struck from the leg spin of Fred Johnston and landed on the roof of the Members Stand. The second, from the occasional left arm unorthodox spin of Test teammate Arthur Morris, was a lofted drive that went straight back over the bowler's head and over the sightscreen at the Paddington End; the ball was still rising when it hit the upper deck of the MA Noble Stand around 100 m away. His third six sent a delivery from Test bowling colleague Toshack over the square leg fence.
At one stage, Toshack had a long-on, long-off and a man directly behind the bowler to stop Miller's powerful drives. One such shot from the bowling of Morris was hit with such power that it rebounded from the sighscreen almost to the bowler. Lindwall, the fastest bowler in the world, was delivering to Miller at one stage with a solitary slip and nine men in the outfield. After his long innings, Miller was only required to bowl two wicketless overs for six runs as New South Wales were bowled out for 189 and suffered a 288-run loss. These two decisive victories played a large part in Victoria's winning of the Sheffield Shield.
Miller's uncertain future continued to dog him, and Rawtenstall expressed their displeasure at their recruit's apparent refusal to fulfil his contract. Miller had privately decided that he would not go through with the deal, but was refusing to inform the Lancastrian club. In the meantime, he had various job proposals, which he spurned until privately receiving a contract offer from the manager of North Sydney Cricket Club. The proposed deal would give him a subsidy for the costs of his relocation to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman, and gave him generous leave conditions so that he could play sport.
Fourth Test.
Having resolved the issue of his playing future, Miller was back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide. In a high-scoring match, Miller took a wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. England batted first and had reached a strong position of 4/320 on the second day when Miller bowled Joe Hardstaff junior, who edged a bouncer into his stumps for 67, ending a partnership of 118 with centurion Compton; the hosts lost wickets steadily thereafter to be dismissed for 460, and Miller ended with 1/45 from 16 overs in extreme heat. After Morris and Hassett put on 179 runs for the third wicket, Miller came in at 3/207 late on the third day and reached 33 by the time stumps were drawn with Australia at 4/293, while his partner Johnson was unbeaten on 35.
On the first ball of the third morning, Miller hooked the ball into the crowd, landing just in front of the governor's VIP box to move to 39. He quickly accumulated another 61 runs in 71 minutes to reach his maiden Test century. Miller and Johnson added a further 79 runs in the morning, of which the latter contributed only 17 before being dismissed for 52, such was Miller's rate of scoring. Miller did not play more expansively after reaching triple figures, as three wickets fell at the other end for 24 runs and the Englishmen, particularly Yardley, utilised leg theory to stifle the scoring. As the English bowlers continued to regularly take tail-end wickets, Miller accelerated again, launching drives into the crowd as England stationed four men on the fence waiting in vain to catch one of his lofted strokes. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 from 198 balls as Australia took a first innings lead, but the match petered into a high-scoring draw. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall unsuccessfully tried to attack Hutton and Washbrook with bouncers as the English openers registered a century partnership. Miller took Bedser's wicket to end with 1/34 from 11 overs as England reached 8/340 before declaring. Miller was not required to bat after Australia were set 314 runs to win in 195 minutes; they reached 1/215 when time ran out.
Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England in his final match for his native state before moving to New South Wales. He scored six before being stumped from the medium pace of Bedser and took 4/63 in the first innings, his best bowling since the First Test, as England scored 355 before Victoria replied with 327. His victims included Gibb, Yardley and Compton for 93, thereby preventing the English batsman from scoring his fifth century in as many innings. The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding two runs without taking a wicket.
Fifth Test.
The Fifth Test saw Miller take a wicket in each innings, his victims being Wright and Evans. He also caught Yardley and Compton in the first and second innings respectively. After Miller scored 23 to help Australia make 253 in reply to England's 280, the tourists fell for 186 in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 214 runs on a wearing wicket that was increasingly aiding spin. Miller came to the crease when Bradman fell with the score at 3/149. McCool joined Miller after the loss of Hassett and Ron Hamence in quick succession left Australia at 5/180. Wright then beat Miller with three consecutive leg breaks, before the batsman struck back against Bedser with consecutive boundaries for four. Together with McCool, Miller saw Australia to the target without further loss.
Australia had taken the series 3–0, Miller scoring 384 runs at 76.80 and taking 16 wickets at 20.88, which placed him second in both batting and bowling averages behind Bradman and Lindwall respectively. Nevertheless, Miller did not enjoy himself as much as during the Victory Tests of 1945 and became disillusioned with Bradman's relentless pursuit of victory and ruthless mentality. Miller was impulsive and cared little for records or mercilessly dominating his opponents; he loved to play in a flamboyant manner with early declarations to keep the match alive and less concern for winning or losing. Hassett had outlined after the Victory Tests that the post-war era should be about "cricket, not war". Miller's Services team-mate and biographer Richard Whitington said that Miller "did not enjoy the humiliation of men who had proved themselves champions before the war".
However, Test cricket had always been fought fiercely, and the ruthless Bradman was not about to change this. The Australian skipper repeatedly shut England out of the game with massive totals, relentlessly snuffing out any prospects of an opposition win rather than maximising the chances of an Australian victory with enterprising declarations. On reflection, Miller said "It was inevitable that The Don and I should have clashed. Our temperaments are so different."
Overall, Miller played in 13 first-class matches during the Australian summer, scoring 1,202 runs at 75.12 and taking 32 wickets at 22.65. In matches for Victoria, where he played under Hassett's captaincy, Miller scored 713 runs at 89.13 and took 14 wickets at 21.14. In all, he took 14 catches. Of the six matches in the victorious Sheffield Shield campaign, five were won and the other was drawn, Miller averaging 133.40.
Playing role.
As England had a strong batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of specialist bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.
Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored multiple first-class centuries in their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 with the ball. As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, as well as both left and right-arm seamers, this also meant that he could only have two fast bowlers—Lindwall and Miller—as three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.
While Miller was a reluctant bowler, Bradman used him heavily because of his desire to have every possible spin option. Miller thus played as a middle-order batsman batting at No. 5 ahead of the wicket-keeper and the other bowlers, and an opening fast bowler, partnering Lindwall. For Victoria, Miller often batted higher at No. 3 or No. 4 and bowled less. For his state, Miller averaged more with the bat, which he felt was because he was able to concentrate more on his batting, as Hassett gave him a smaller workload with the ball.

Indianapolis Fire Department

The Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) is the principal fire suppression, prevention, and rescue agency of Indianapolis, Indiana, under the jurisdiction of the Mayor of Indianapolis. In 2010, the IFD responded to 154,727 emergency calls.
History.
The first fire department in Indianapolis was not founded until June 20, 1826. It was a volunteer department that had to use a church bell for alarms, and had only ladders and leather buckets to fight fires. This was seventeen months after the first recorded fire in Indianapolis occurred on January 17, 1825, which took place across the street from the county courthouse in a tavern.
In 1835, a law was passed requiring the purchase of an engine, along with better equipment, to be partially funded by the state and partially by the city, in order to protect the Indiana statehouse. From this, the Marion Fire, Hose, and Protection Company was established. An additional volunteer company was founded in 1841 and there were eight total volunteer companies in Indianapolis by 1859. Collectively, 600 men were volunteers in these eight companies, and although unpaid, they did receive perks such as immunity from being called on juries or militia duty, and not having to pay poll taxes or taxes for roads.
The volunteer companies were rather political, and tended to express their views freely. They were also known to break into brothels and freely use their hoses on the clientele and the interior walls, wrecking the places; this was done not for moral reasons, but rather, to amuse themselves. As a result, the Indianapolis City Council established a paid force on November 14, 1859, so that the council could have control over Indianapolis' fire protection, which it did not have over the volunteers. The Indianapolis Fire Department began with a hook and ladder company and two hand engines, but would in 1860 gain their first steam engine.
The paid firemen had no days off, were not allowed to leave their post except for one meal, and were seldom allowed to leave the firehouse unless on fire business or a family emergency. An ordinance in 1859 made it illegal to give firemen alcoholic beverages. Their clothes were irregular; uniforms were not worn until 1874, with a regulation uniform established in 1928. Firemen had to buy their own uniforms until 1943, when a $60 clothing allowance was established. An attempt to remove politics from the fire department was not very successful; it was necessary to mandate that the department staff be half Republican and half Democrat, and the role of fire chief was based on political affiliation and family contacts.
The first dog to discover arson for the Indianapolis Fire Department was acquired in July 1993.
Operations.
There are currently 14 Divisions of Operations in the Indianapolis Fire Department: Communications, Emergency Operations, Emergency Medical Services, Executive Services, Finance and Pension, Fire Investigations Section, Fire and Life Safety, Homeland Security/Special Operations and Training, Quartermaster, Information Technology, Media Relations, Safety, Support Services, and USAR Indiana Task Force One.
There are currently 45 Fire Stations located throughout the city of Indianapolis, organized into 7 Battalions. The IFD operates and maintains a fire apparatus fleet of 43 Engines, 23 Ladders, 6 Squads(Medic), 13 Tactical Rescue Units (including one Trailer), 4 Tactical Support Units (TSU's), 32 Medic Units (IEMS Medic Ambulances), 2 Tankers, a Foam Unit, 2 Decontamination Units, 1 Mass Casualty Unit(MERV), 1 Grass Rig, 4 Rescue Boats, 3 Rehabilitation Units(RHU), 3 Safety Officers Units, 2 EMS Duty Officer's Units, and a Shift Commander's Unit.
The following is a listing of all fire station locations and apparatus in the IFD, organized by battalion.

KMEZ

KMEZ, is a radio station serving the New Orleans area. The Cumulus Media station is licensed to Port Sulphur, Louisiana and broadcasts at 106.7 MHz with an ERP of 100,000 watts. At 3pm on 5/21/08, the station switched to a simulcast of KKND, which lasted until July 1, 2008, when it chose a Rhythmic contemporary format to air at the 102.9 frequency.
History.
The station, whose previous formats were Gospel, oldies, country and Smooth Jazz, was Modern rocker KKND ("106.7 The End") from November 1996 to August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck the area and took the station's transmitter off the air. Original jocks on The End were Laura Jones, Rod Ryan (now at KTBZ-FM/Houston) and Jason Ginty (now at WRKN/New Orleans). Some other notable air personalities to work on the station throughout the years were Denver Crabb, Darren Gauthier, Matt West and Wolfgang Velasco.
On January 7, 2006, KKND returned to the air with its new format, "Rockin' Country 106.7", a move that angered the loyal fans and listeners of The End. During this time, Scot Spinnato was an on air personality during the day. He was a former member of the Rod Ryan morning show cast.
In early 2007, the station dropped the rock variant of the format and became all-country, with the new slogan "New Country First." The station personalities were Trapper John, Darlas Rai, Chris Clare, Jim Patrick, Jason Peavy, and Chase Adams.
On December 26, 2007, KKND flipped to "Fresh Country Favorites" as "106-7 The Wolf". The last song as "106-7 KKND" was Kenny Chesney's "No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems", while the first song as The Wolf was Shania Twain's "You're Still The One." 
On May 20, 2008, at 2:50 PM, the station dropped its country format, with the last song being Sara Evans' "Suds in the Bucket" and began simulcasting sister station KMEZ at 102.9 FM with the song "(Olivia) Lost and Turned Out" by The Whispers. KMEZ moved over to the 106.7 signal from their former home at 102.9 on July 3, 2008 after nearly two months of simulcasting. 102.9 would become Rhythmic contemporary "Power 102.9." When the simulcast began, the station changed monikers to "Old School 106.7."
The station has had many callsigns in its 20 year history including KQLD under the oldies format (1988-1993; the first FM oldies station in New Orleans), KGTR (under its first run as a country station as "106.7 the Gator"), KLJZ as "Smooth Jazz 106.7", KKND under its complete Modern Rock and second runs as a country station, a short 13 day run as KXOS and its current KMEZ broadcasting a gold-based Urban AC format as "Old School 106.7".
In December 2013, KMEZ picked up the syndication rights to the "Tom Joyner Morning Show" from crosstown competitor WYLD-FM.

Our Long Road Home

Our Long Road Home is the fourth studio album and third independent album by alternative metal band Taproot and was released on September 16, 2008. The album is Taproot's first independent release since 1999's "Upon Us" and was released through Velvet Hammer, the label founded by the eponymous management company that has worked with bands such as System of a Down, Deftones, Alice in Chains. This album also marks the drop of producer Toby Wright who had worked on the band's previous two studio releases.
The album's lead single would be "Wherever I Stand"; although, "You're Not Home Tonight" has received radio play as well. The title "Our Long Road Home" suits the band's roots in Ann Arbor area in which it was recorded. The track "It's Natural" includes a female vocalist, which is a first for the band. "Stethoscope" and "Hand That Holds True" are the OLRH Teaser #1 clips that Taproot released on YouTube; these were followed by "Path Less Taken."
The album debuted at #65 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, with first week sales of 7,700.
Production.
"Budget cuts and political shifts," according to Taproot vocalist Stephen Richards, cost them their label support with Atlantic. This led the band to "try doing something different" and release "Our Long Road Home" independently. The album was recorded at The Loft, a barn converted into a recording studio in Saline, Michigan. Richards, living 10 minutes away from the studio, considered this convenient due to various band members now having families and wanting to stay close to them. He noted "For the first time, instead of being thousands of miles away and being forced to be creative, we were at home, inspired by the things we know and love." Guitarist Mike DeWolf wrote one of the songs and Richards played drums during the recording process. "Our Long Road Home" was originally scheduled for release on August 5 but was pushed back due to mixing problems and the addition of two "heavier" songs.
Taproot has since noted the mixed fan reception toward the progressive sound of "Our Long Road Home". In March 2010, when discussing the band's upcoming "Plead the Fifth", guitarist Mike DeWolf stated:

KKND

KKND better known as "Power 102.9" is a Rhythmic Contemporary outlet serving the New Orleans area. The Cumulus Media station is licensed to Belle Chasse, Louisiana and broadcasts its format at 102.9 MHz with an ERP of 4.7 kW. The station competes with Clear Channel's WQUE for ratings.
History.
The station, whose original calls were KMEZ, started off in 1992 with a gold-based Urban AC format and was known on-air as "Big Eazy 102.9", only to later re-image as "Old School 102.9" in an effort to capitialize on the growing interest in the Rhythmic/Urban Oldies format. By 2004, it modified its format by adding current Adult R&B product to its playlist and reimaged itself again as "102.9, Old School & Today's R&B" to reflect the changes—and compete with WYLD-FM and hip hop station WQUE. Despite being an Urban AC, KMEZ, who, during the fall of 2007, became the flagship station of the New Orleans Hornets of the National Basketball Association.
On May 20, 2008, KMEZ began simulcasting sister station KKND, who in turn, dropped their struggling country format. The simulcast also marked KMEZ's move to the 106.7 frequency. This station received the callsign of KKND from KXOS on May 29, 2008, who changed their callsign to KMEZ.
On July 1, 2008, Citadel Broadcasting officially chose Rhythmic Contemporary as the new format for the 102.9 frequency by unveiling the all-new "Power 102.9." The station's logo and Hip-Hop direction is loosely based on KPWR/Los Angeles and is expected to challenge WQUE, who has dominated the R&B/Hip-Hop scene in New Orleans for nearly two decades and has yet to be defeated. Two days later on July 3 at exactly 10:29 AM (CDT), Power 102.9 made its debut by signing on with Lil' Wayne featuring Static Major's "Lollipop".
The station carried the syndicated "Big Boy's Neighborhood" from ABC Radio when it first signed on. In March 2010, due to the possibility of the show being cancelled due to the loss of their syndication deal with ABC, the program was dropped for a local show hosted by Big Abe & The Power Posse. But that only lasted two years, as they were replaced by the Atlanta-based "Rickey Smiley Morning Show" in October 2012.
Despite having a Hip-Hop heavy direction, KKND has adjusted its musical focus in summer 2013 to allow some Rhythmic Pop tracks to be played on the station. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

Bombing of South-East Asia (1944–45)

During the final stage of World War II, from 1944 to 1945, the South East Asian theatre experienced strategic bombing by Allied forces. The main victims of Allied air raids were Japan, Thailand and French Indochina.
Royal Navy operations.
By 1944, the German Navy no longer presented a major threat and the Royal Navy was able to transfer major units to the Far East. This would fulfil a British wish to become involved in the Pacific War. First, however, experience was required of large-scale naval air operations and of United States procedures. To this end and to degrade Japanese capabilities, attacks were made on Indonesian oil installations, some in concert with the American carrier, USS "Saratoga".
Indochina bombing campaign.
Because colonial French Indochina remained loyal to the Vichy government and made numerous concessions to Japan, including allow Japanese troops, ships and airplanes to be stationed in Cochinchina, the Allies targeted industrial and military facilities in neutral Indochina beginning in 1942. In this the Allies were aided by a young French naval officer, Robet Meynier, who, beginning in May 1943, organised a network of informants in the bureaucracy of French Indochina. Before the collapse of the network in mid-1944 it managed to provide information on bombing targets, Japanese troops whereabouts and fortifications. In August 1942, the United States Fourteenth Air Force based in southern China undertook the first air raids in Indochina. In September 1943, the United States picked up the pace of the bombing, hitting the harbour of Haiphong repeatedly. By the end of 1944 the Japanese were entirely avoiding Haiphong. In late 1943 the Americans began raiding the phosphate mines at Lao Cai and Cao Bang. In all of this the air force had the help of "GBT", a multi-ethnic (and possibly Freemason) network of spies and informants working outside control of either Vichy of the Free French. In September 1944 the Americans dropped leaflets in French and Vietnamese showing pictures of the liberation of Paris, and quoting various jovial war correspondents from Europe.
Coal mined in the Hon Gai region around Haiphong, was shipped south along the coast, either by train or by junk, to be converted into charcoal gas, which was necessary to replace dwindling gasoline and petroleum supplies. The Allies targeted these shipments, putting a stop to them by the end of the year (1944). Besides charcoal gas, the Japanese in Indochina relied on ethanol, usually produced from rice, and on butanol as fuel for motor vehicles and aircraft, respectively. Two butanol distilleries at Cholon became the targets of airstrikes in February 1944, and the ethanol distilleries of Nam Dinh and Thanh Hoa were hit several times into March. By the summer, the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was reporting increased alcohol production in the north, in Tonkin, even as the famine was spreading. In April–May, American bombers hit the spinning and weaving mills of Haiphong and Nam Dinh, although the villagers continued cloth production on hand looms in nearby villages. In May the US Air Force began sending B-24 Liberators on night runs over Saigon, hitting mainly port facilities and railyards, but also some residential neighbourhoods. On 16 May an attack killed 213 native civilians and injured another 843. Detailed target maps of Saigon were produced based on information obtained in April–June 1944. On 7 February 1945, a B-29 Superfortress, flying from Calcutta through cloud cover, and dropping bombs by radar, mistakenly hit a hospital and a French barracks in Saigon. Thirty Europeans and 150 natives were killed, hundreds more injured, and not one Japanese harmed.
The British intelligence mission Force 136 air-dropped several Free French operatives into Indochina in early 1945. They provided detailed information on targets to British headquarters in India and China, who transmitted them to the Americans. The French operatives were reluctant to provide information on French or Vietnamese targets, and their most important contribution was relating ship movements along the coast. American carrier aircraft sank twenty-four vessels and damaged another thirteen in January 1945. An OSS report of 19 March 1945 contains eight pages of shipping information from one anonymous French official who had contacts from Saigon in the south to Qui Nhon in the north. Another Frenchman, a civilian ship pilot working for the Japanese on the Saigon river, sent shipping informatino to the Americans until March, and even continued with Japanese until the war's end without being discovered.
"By July 1945, American aircraft roamed Indochina at will, bombing and strafing trains, small postal and passenger boats, government buildings, and storage facilities of any description."
As the famine spread, on 8 March 1945, General Eugène Mordant of the Corps Léger d'Intervention radioed the Free French government in Paris asking them to pressure the United States to halt bombing operations against the ports north of Vinh, in a vain effort to forestall further food shortages. The Fourteenth Air Force could not render tactical air cover to the French and Indochinese defending Lang Son from a hostile Japanese takeover on 9–10 March. After the citadel capitulated on 12 March, bombers of the Fourteenth did strike it, inadvertently killing several hundred native Vietnamese riflemen who were being interned there by the Japanese. Between 12 and 28 March, the Americans flew thirty-four bombing, strafing and reconnaissance missions over Vietnam, although the commanding general, Claire Chennault, refused to air-drop weapons in light of the confusing situation on the ground. He did, however, drop medicines.
The American bombing campaign gained intensity afer the surrender of Germany and victory in Europe. On 4 July 1945 in Nam Dinh province American airplanes hit the steam launch "Nam Hai", killing two and hospitalising twenty-seven (with two dying en route); five others were missing. A few days later Haiphong was struck, sinking a dredge and a floating dock. The Japanese moved their ships up the Mekong river from Saigon and Cap St Jacques (now Vung Tau). The United States also dropped leaflets in French, Vietnamese and Japanese, and some were bilingual. They warned people to stay away from railroads, bridges and ferries, and cautioned them against helping the Japanese to repair bomb damage: "Our airplanes will come again, and if you are near the target you will probably be killed by association." After the victory over Japan, on 19 August the denizens of Hanoi broke into the streets and removed the black coverings of the street lamps.

Mokuʻula

Mokuula is a tiny island now buried beneath an abandoned baseball field in Maluulu o Lele Park, Lahaina, Hawaii. It was the private residence of King Kamehameha III from 1837 to 1845 and the burial site of several Hawaiian royals. The island was and continues to be considered sacred to many Hawaiians as a "piko", or symbolic center of energy and power. According to Klieger, "the moated palace of Mokuula...was a place of the "Sacred Red Mists," an oasis of rest and calm during the raucous, rollicking days of Pacific whaling." When the capital of Hawaii moved from Lahaina to Honolulu, Mokuula fell into disrepair. By 1919, the county turned the land into a park. Efforts are currently underway to revive the site.
It was added to the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places on August 29, 1994, and to the National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 1997 as King Kamehameha III's Royal Residential Complex.
Loko o Mokuhinia.
Mokuula was surrounded by Mokuhinia, a spring-fed, wetland pond. The pond was reported to be the home of Kihawahine, a powerful "moo" or lizard goddess. According to myth, the moo was a reincarnation of Pi'ilani's daughter, the chiefess, Kalaaiheana. Hawaiians cultivated loi, or taro patches, and fishponds within Mokuhinia.
Restoration.
The Friends of Mokuula, a non-profit organization dedicated to restoration of the sacred site, formed in 1990. Members lead tours of the area. From 1992-1995 and in 1999, archaeologists from Bishop Museum and Heritage Surveys surveyed the site and began documenting its features and boundaries.

Traditional fishing tackle

This article is about traditional fishing instruments used by the people of Central India. Many of these are mainly made up of bamboo at Mendha and from synthetic material at Khursa. Following types of indigenous fishing instruments has been documented from both villages,
"Dhiri".
Reported from Mendha, this is a rectangular trap of bamboo sticks (Locally called "kaduhu") interwoven by nylon threads (initially instead of nylon threads fiber made up of the boyal tree were in use). This is a passive method of fishing. Virtually this trap operate on a 'funnel' or 'maze' principle, with fish passing easily through an entrance hole, but being confused by the blind endings within the trap and being unable to find their way out. 
The dimensions of box vary as per need, but standard size is to long, 0.5 to wide and 1 to high. This structure has 2 to 3 doors on both sides. The entrances or doors are very specialized structures, work as one-way valves, due to this valve fish can enter inside but cannot escape. The diameter of the doors is wide, so that fish of this much of size can only be caught. 
"Dhiri" are set in running water generally in night. The setting of the "dhiri" is laborious work and needs about 1 hour time. This can only set in at least deep water (so that water level should be slightly above the door) with the help of rope, mud and branches of the trees. Fishes moving along with stream of water enters into the doors. About 1 kg to as much as 10 kg live fish can be caught without any physical damage. Another morning or after 4 to 5 hours fish can be collected from the upper hole. Interestingly some time water snakes are also caught in the "dhiri".(Heda, 2007)
"Kurjar".
Reported from Mendha, this is active method of the fish trapping. "Kurjar" is a dome of bamboo (shaped just like a satellite antenna disc) made up of 12 bamboo sticks (locally called "kurjar guta") arranged in circle and tighten to each other with the help of rope. To these sticks, nylon mesh is tightly attached (initially instead of nylon threads fiber from the boyal tree were in use). Mesh size measured 15×15 mm at lower wide end and 20×20 mm towards rear end. After assembly, circumference of the dome becomes and height becomes . 
Its application is very interesting: during monsoon flood when the shoal of migrating fishes seen by a knowledgeable individual, running from the bank into river "kurjar" drop on migrating fishes. Fish trapped under "kurjar" are collected by hand. Observation during its application reveals that it was not much effective; as it is very much time consuming compared with the low yield. To use "kurjar" it is important to have knowledge about the migratory behavior of the fishes.(Heda, 2007)
"Dhundka".
Dhundka is reported from Mendha. This is very simple structure exclusively made up of bamboo. "Dhundka", an earthen pot like structure has circumference of about 90 to . One end of the pot has a rounded hole of diameter. This circular hole attached with a pipe made from hollow stem of gongum "(Cochlospermum religiosum)," gopid "(Lannea coromandelica)" or bamboo "(Bambusa arundinacea)". The gongal or gopid used as the stem of these plants has smooth, slimy inner side (so that fish readily slip inside).
This can be applied in small cascades with the help of pipe attached. Fishes along with falling water enters through pipe and falls into the "dhundka". Overnight, about 1 kg of fish can be caught in the "dhundka".(Heda, 2007).
"Garri" (hooks).
"Garri" is popular among children. This is nothing but the popular baited hooks. The stick used made up of bamboo. Earthworms and or small dead fish are used for bait.(Heda, 2007).
"Zinka".
Reported from Mendha, this is bamboo mat as much as long and wide, depending upon the length of available bamboo and width of stream. It is fixed against water current so that it should immerse half in water. Flowing with water, fishes jumps on the non-immersed part of "zinka" and die due to asphyxia. This is generally used in the outlets of agriculture field. Very small size fishes were observed during catching.(Heda, 2007).
"Dandoor".
Reported from Mendha, this is cylindrical structure made up of bamboo sticks. Just like "dhiri" it has a one-way valve. This is similar in function with "dhiri". Large size fishes can be caught in the cylinder. (Heda, 2007).
"Gappa".
Reported from Mendha, this is active method of catching fishes usually from the shallow pools. Women catch fishes with the help of this bamboo pot. This is circular pot made up of bamboo sticks. Originally, it is devised for the agriculture purpose, to collects grains etc. From a shallow pool, water is thrown out side (some time on the "zinka") along with water fish thrown out and collected in a "dooti" (a small bamboo pot for fish collection).(Heda, 2007).
"Joka" (deep, lift net).
Reported from Mendha, this is a very simple bamboo made structure used to catch fishes from the small, shallow pools and ponds just like "gappa". It is nothing but a deep or lift net. Two people lower this bamboo pot into water and periodically taken out of water with fish.(Heda, 2007).
"Kotra".
This gadget is used by Dhivar people of this area. This is a large net used in running water and after monsoon (September). This net has two parts viz. a "pusa" (net proper) and "ghumla," a bamboo-made cylindrical structure. The net proper is made up of nylon threads. The net is long and about 2 to in circumference. One end of the "pusa" is attached to "ghumla". Water current is confined to flow through "kotra". For its application the velocity of water current should be high otherwise the fishes can return and escape. Flowing fishes trap into the "kotra". (Heda, 2007).
"Koturli".
This gadget is used by Dhivar people of this area. It is a type of the small gill net.(Heda, 2007).
"Tangad".
This gadget is used by Dhivar people of this area. This is just like gill net with dimensions measuring long and wide. It is generally used to catch large size fishes in fish culture ponds.(Heda, 2007).
"Pandi".
This gadget is used by Dhivar people of this area. It is just like gill net with dimensions measured long and wide. This is generally used to catch large fish.(Heda, 2007).
Cast nets.
Use of the cast net is very common practice among the Dhivar fisherman but it is not found among Gond, as it needs expertise to use and it is costly. The "Ghan bhor jar" (small cast net) has acircumference measured 8.4 m and mesh size is 9×9 mm. (Heda, 2007).
The "motha bhor jar" (large cast net) is used by Dhivar people of this area.
"Pelni".
This gadget is used by Dhivar people of this area. This is a triangle of the three bamboo poles to which a fine mesh is attached. It is applied against flowing water and once shoal of flowing fish enters inside, the net lifts and entered fish are collected.(Heda, 2007).
"Zoruli".
This gadget is used by Dhivar people of this area. This is a type of lift net and used to catch small sized fishes for household consumption.(Heda, 2007).
"Atki" (gill net).
This is passive method of the fishing and most popular among the Dhivar and not used at all by Gond tribal. This is gill net made up of synthetic fibers. Initially the cotton fibers were in use. The length, width and mesh size is highly variable and depends on what sized fishes to be caught and habitat of its application (If the habitat depth is more large size gill net used). Weaving of the gill net is skilled work and it is an important pastime of the Dhivar people.(Heda, 2007).

Millbrook Reservoir

Millbrook Reservoir is a 16,000-megalitre artificial water storage reservoir in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. It was built from 1914 to 1918 during World War I to control water flows in the upper River Torrens and provide gravity-fed water to Adelaide's eastern suburbs.
It is named after the small town of Millbrook, demolished and removed during construction. During the 1970s, the nearby town of Chain Of Ponds, South Australia was also removed to prevent pollution of the reservoir's water.
Millbrook covers behind a clay-cored earth dam. It lies on Chain of Ponds creek, a tributary of the River Torrens. Water in the reservoir is piped from a weir near Gumeracha but it is also used to balance storage of River Murray water via the Mannum–Adelaide pipeline. It is used to capture approximately half of the Torrens' water flow.
John Tippett named the town of Millbrook in the late 19th century after Millbrook in his native Cornwall.
The settlement was a suburb of Adelaide.
