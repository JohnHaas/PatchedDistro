Basic Concepts in Music Education

Basic Concepts in Music Education is a landmark work published in 1958 as the Fifty-Seventh Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education. In 1954, the Music Educators National Conference () had formed its Commission on Basic Concepts in an attempt to seek a more soundly-based philosophical foundation. The work of the commission resulted in the publication of "Basic Concepts," which advocated an aesthetic justification for music education. According to the aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified for its own sake rather than for its extra-musical benefits.
Basic Concepts II.
Richard Colwell edited "Basic Concepts in Music Education II" in 1991. This volume included updates from the living authors of the original volume as well as new contributions from leaders in the field.

DB Class V 60

The DB Class V 60 is a German diesel locomotive operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) and later, the Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG), which is used particularly for shunting duties, but also for hauling light goods trains. Seventeen locomotives were bought used by the Norwegian State Railways and designated NSB Di 5. Also the Yugoslav Railways bought used units, and designated them JŽ 734; they were subsequently designated Series 2133 by the Croatian Railways.
History.
The DB had a shortage of small shunters. As a result, in 1951, a diesel shunter was designed, almost all the major locomotive firms being involved in its development and production. The new class was initially called the V 60. In 1955 the first prototype locomotives, V 60 001–004, were delivered by Krupp, Krauss-Maffei, Mak and Henschel, each having different engines. Later that same year orders for the first production locomotives were issued; they were to have GTO 6 or GTO 6A motors from Maybach. Several of the locomotives were given a stronger frame and had a higher adhesive weight of instead of . In addition these engines could carry up to an extra of ballast for heavy duties, however they continued to be classed as V 60s. A total of 942 locomotives of this class were built. In 1968 the V 60s, like all other DB locomotives were given computer readable numbers. At this point the class was divided into Classes 260 (light variant) and 261 (heavy variant).
Norwegian State Railways.
In the 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) saw a need for shunters to replace the aging Di 2 units and chose to buy seven used V 260 from DB in 1985 and given the designation NSB Di 5. Two years later NSB bought another ten units, but one of them was only used for spare parts. The locomotives were numbered 5.861–877. They were scrapped between 1996 and 1998—none have been preserved.
Croatian Railways.
In 1985, the Yugoslav Railways (JŽ) bought some used locomotives. They were designated JŽ 734. After the split, they were transferred to the Croatian Railways and designated Class 2133. There were two subtypes: 2133-0 with traction effort , and 2133-1 with traction effort .
Technology.
The V 60 (260/261) is long and can run at speeds of up to . 
The frame is fully welded. The transmission is under the driver's cab, which itself is not quite in the centre of the vehicle. Under the front end is the motor and cooling system, under the rear end the brake compressor and main air reservoir, the fuel system and a tank. The driver's cab is sound-proofed, the footplate is at the front and the loco can be operated from either side.
The drive is achieved using a 12 cylinder Maybach GT06-diesel motor capable of producing . This engine is an evolutionary development of the type G05, which was installed from 1932 in various railcars including the "Flying Hamburger". The locomotive is driven by means of a hydraulic transmission by Voith via a jackshaft and coupling rods to the three axles, a concept that had also been used on earlier shunting engines such as the Class V 36. 
The centre axle has about of lateral play. Between the second and third axle there is a jack shaft.
The locomotives have shunting and running gears.
In order to start the diesel motor, it has to be pre-heated. The first batches had a small coke oven (later ones used an oil burner) and, for that reason, the locomotive carried up to of coke. The Class 362/363 engines had an electrically-controlled preheater and heat retention system. 
The locomotives had a compressed air through brake, an auxiliary brake and a hand brake that braked the third axle.
Operations.
The engines were not just used for shunting, but also for light goods and passenger train services. They were even employed hauling departmental trains. 
After the V 60 had been in service for about 25 years, in 1982 the DB tested a variety of shunting engines under the Class 259, which were to be the successors of the V 60. They were unable to decide on one, however, so that in the following years several measures were carried out in order to improve the economy of the V 60.
In 1987 the engine was classified as a minor locomotive ("Kleinlok") and reclassified. Class 260 became Class 360 and the 261s became 361s. Its categorisation as a "Kleinlok" saved staff costs, because the railway no longer had to employ "engine drivers", only "Kleinlok operators", whose training was cheaper. The installation of radio control enabled one-man shunting movements using remote control; the fully radio controlled models were called the Class 364 (light class) or 365 (heavy class), however the only loco in Class 364 was soon renumbered to 365 700. 
Since 1997 the Maybach motors have been replaced during refurbishment by Caterpillar 12-cylinder engines generating 465 kW (632 PS), this conversion only being done on engines with radio control. These locos are designated as Class 362 (light variant) and 363 (heavy variant).
In 2001 one engine was equipped with a Caterpillar V8 engine run on natural gas and tested in the Munich area; it was designated as Class 760. It has since been scrapped.
Of the 942 locomotives originally supplied to the DB, many are still active. Those without radio control were gradually retired by early 2003, of the radio controlled locos around 400 were still working for the DB in 2004, several of which have ended up in private or industrial railways in Germany and elsewhere, as well as the state railways in Turkey, the former Yugoslavia (e.g. the Croatian Railways HŽ series 2133) and Norway (17 engines as NSB Di 5). In 2008 over 70 were owned by German private and industrial lines, of which the majority were working in construction logistics and in local goods services.
Locomotive number 362 362 is the first V 60, that has clocked up 50 years of services in the DB/DBAG - it entered service on 12 April 1957 and is currently (2008) the third oldest locomotive in DB AG service.
Identical or similar locos were and are also used by other state railways. As early as the 1960s they were delivered to places like Greece (Hellenic State Railways, class A-101) or Turkey, or built under licence as in Belgium. Even Israel ran very similar engines.
The museum locomotive V 60 150 was burnt up in the great fire at the Nuremberg Transport Museum's locomotive shed.

Dersim Massacre

The Dersim Massacre took place in 1937 and 1938 in Dersim, now called Tunceli Province, in Turkey. It was the outcome of a Turkish military campaign against the Dersim Rebellion by local ethnic minority groups against Turkey's Resettlement Law of 1934. Thousands of Alevi Kurds and Zazas died and many others were internally displaced due to the conflict.
On 23 November 2011, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gave an apology for the Dersim operation, describing it as "one of the most tragic events of our recent history".
Rebellion in Dersim.
In 1934, Turkey passed a Resettlement Law, aimed at assimilating ethnic minority communities within the country. Its measures included the forced relocation of people within the country, with the aim of promoting cultural homogeneity. In 1935, the Tunceli Law was passed to apply the Resettlement Law to the newly named region of Tunceli, previously known as Dersim and populated by Kurmanci-speaking and Zaza-speaking Alevis. This area had a reputation for being rebellious, having been the scene of eleven separate periods of armed conflict over the previous 40 years. 
Following public meetings in January 1937, a letter of protest against the law was written to be sent to the local governor. According to Kurdish sources, the emissaries of the letter were arrested and executed. In May, a group of local people ambushed a police convoy in response, the first act of a localised conflict.
Around 25,000 troops were deployed to quell the rebellion. This task was substantially completed by the summer and the leaders of the rebellion, including tribal leader Sayiid Riza, were hanged. However, remnants of the rebel forces continued to resist and the number of troops in the region was doubled. The methods used by the army were brutal, including the mass killing of civilians, the razing of homes and the deportation of people from less hostile areas. The area was also bombed from the air. The rebels continued to resist until the region was pacified in October 1938.
Numbers killed.
The contemporary British estimate of the number of deaths was 40,000, although historians suggest that this figure may be exaggerated. It has been suggested that the total number of deaths may be 7,594, over 10,000, or over 13,000. Around 3,000 people were forcibly deported from Dersim.
A 2008 conference organised by Kurdish PEN reached the conclusion that Turkey was guilty of genocide, estimating that 50,000–80,000 were killed in the aftermath of the Dersim rebellion.
Genocide controversy.
Many Kurds and some ethnic Turks consider the events that took place in Dersim to constitute genocide. A prominent proponent of this view is the academic İsmail Beşikçi. Under international laws, it has been argued, the actions of the Turkish authorities were not genocide, because they were not aimed at the extermination of a people, but at resettlement and suppression. Scholars, such as Martin van Bruinessen, have instead talked of an ethnocide directed against the local language and identity.
In March 2011, a Turkish court ruled that the actions of the Turkish government in Dersim could not be considered genocide according to the law because they were not directed systematically against an ethnic group.
Government apology.
On 23 November 2011, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan apologised on behalf of the state for the Dersim massacre during a televised meeting of his party in Ankara. His comments were pointedly directed at opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. Erdogan reminded his audience that Kılıçdaroğlu's party, the CHP, had been in power at the time of the massacre, then the only political party in Turkey. He described the massacre as "one of the most tragic events of our near history" saying that, whilst some sought to justify it as a legitimate response to events on the ground, it was in reality "an operation which was planned step by step".

Elisabeth Welch

Elisabeth Margaret Welch (February 19, 1904 – July 15, 2003) was an American singer, actress, and entertainer, whose career spanned seven decades. Her best-known songs were "Stormy Weather", "Love for Sale" and "Far Away in Shanty Town". She was American-born but was based in Britain for most of her career.
Early life.
Welch was born in Englewood, New Jersey, where her father was chief gardener of an estate. Her father was of indigenous American and African American ancestry; her mother was of Scottish and Irish descent. Welch was brought up in a Baptist Christian family, and began her singing in a church choir.
She first intended to go from high school into social work, but instead chose to became a professional singer. She started her career in America, in New York, in 1922, but in 1929 she went on to Europe - first to Paris and then to London, which became her base for the rest of her life.
Professional career.
After her first appearance in America in "Liza" in 1922, Elisabeth Welch was the initial singer of the Charleston in the show "Runnin' Wild" (1923). During the 1920s she appeared in African-American Broadway theatre shows, including "Chocolate Dandies" (1924) and "Blackbirds of 1928" (1928-9). She made relatively few recordings. Before moving to Europe she made only one record - "Doin' The New Lowdown", b/w 'Digga Digga Do", as vocalist for the Irving Mills-assembled "Hotsy Totsy Gang" (Brunswick 4014, 27 July 1928).
One of these was taken to Paris, where in 1929 and 1930, following artist Josephine Baker, she was in cabaret shows, including performances at the Moulin Rouge.
She was asked to return to New York, where she replaced a singer in "The New Yorkers" (1930-1931) and sang Cole Porter's controversial song "Love for Sale". The composer met her afterwards in Paris, and later invited her to perform his song "Solomon" in "Nymph Errant" in London in 1933. That year, before this show was available, Welch was given permission to perform in London in "Dark Doings", in which she sang "Stormy Weather", newly written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. She subsequently took the song as her signature tune.
Welch's show-stopping performance in "Nymph Errant" was seen by Ivor Novello, and in 1935 he gave her a part in his show "Glamorous Night", in which she stood out again singing his blues song "Far Away in Shanty Town".
In the late 1930s Welch entered two media: she appeared in films - usually as a singer, including two with Paul Robeson - and was also one of the first artists to perform on television, appearing on the BBC's new TV service from Alexandra Palace.
During World War II she remained in London in spite of the Blitz. She also entertained the armed forces along with many other artists.
After the war she was in many West End theatre shows, including revues. She continued on both television and radio, and was even in one pantomime, "Aladdin". She also had a series of one-woman shows, until 1990. She was in the Royal Variety Performance in 1979 and 1986. In 1979 her recording of "Stormy Weather" was used by Derek Jarman in his film version of Shakespeare's "Tempest".
In 1980 she returned to New York to appear in "Black Broadway" after an absence of nearly fifty years, and she appeared there again in 1986, when her one-woman show earned her an Obie Award. She was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in "Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood".
Her final performance was in 1996, for a television documentary, in which she sang "Stormy Weather", at the age of 93.
Personal life.
In 1928 she was married to Luke Smith, a musician, and remained with him until his death in 1936; they had no children.
Death.
She died at the age of 99 in Northwood, London, on July 15, 2003.

Mercedes Matter

Mercedes Matter née Carles (1913 – December 2001) was an American painter and draughtswoman. Her father was the American modernist painter Arthur Beecher Carles who had studied with Henri Matisse. Her mother, Mercedes de Cordoba, was a model for Edward Steichen. Matter grew up in Philadelphia, New York and Europe.
She first painted under her father's supervision at age 6 and would later recall being given a paintbox to use while working alongside him in the French countryside. At the age of 12, she returned to Europe and lived in Italy for over 2 years. She would later recount that her time in Italy—including Venice, Assisi, Rome, and Florence—was formative and her primary education in art history. Subsequent studies included at Bennett College in Millbrook, NY with sculptor Lu Duble, and in New York City with Maurice Sterne, Alexander Archipenko and Hans Hofmann.
In the late 1930s, Matter was an original member of the American Abstract Artists. She also worked for the Works Progress Administration. She worked with Fernand Léger, who would become a close friend, on his mural for the French Line passenger ship company and again privately on another mural. Léger introduced her to Herbert Matter, the Swiss graphic designer and photographer whom she married in 1939. He also resided with the couple for a year sharing their studio and apartment.
The Matters were active in the emerging mid-century New York art scene, and contact with other artists was important to them. Close friends included Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Alexander Calder and Willem de Kooning.
In 1943, the Matters moved to California. Matter was raising an infant son but the environment away from New York was affecting her work. She returned to New York in 1946.
Beginning in 1953, Matter taught at the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the Arts) for 10 years, and then at the Pratt Institute for 10 years. She later taught at New York University for several years. She was a visiting critic at Antioch, Brandeis, Cincinnati School of Art, Kansas City Art Institute, Maryland Institute College of Art, Yale University, Skowhegan and American University in Washington, DC..
In 1964, she founded the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture. A year earlier, she wrote an article for ARTnews titled "What's Wrong with U.S. Art Schools?" in which she criticised the phasing out of extended studio classes which served "that painfully slow education of the senses," which she considered essential. The article prompted a group of Pratt students, as well as some from Philadelphia, to ask Matter to form a school based on her ideas. The school was originally housed in a loft on Broadway and gained almost immediate support from the Kaplan Fund, Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III and the Ford Foundation. It granted no degrees, had only studio classes and emphasized drawing from life. Early teachers, chosen by the students, included the artists Philip Guston, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Charles Cajori, Louis Finkelstein and Sidney Geist; the art historian Meyer Schapiro; and the composer Morton Feldman. The school continues to train emerging artists.
The Matters lived on Macdougal Alley for years, where Mr. Matter had a studio in one of the eight small buildings that had housed the original locale of what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art.
In later life, the Matters moved to Long Island. Matter suffered a serious illness in 1979 and thereafter her husband became terminally ill. He died in 1984. She would later state that following his death, she coped by immersing herself in an intense period of work which became a sort of harvest of all the years of effort. She taught at the Studio School every other week and remained very much involved in its development. In addition to her art and teaching, she wrote articles on artists, including Hofmann, Kline and Giacometti. She wrote the text for a book of her husband's photographs of Giacometti, published in 1987, four years after his death.
Matter died in 2001.

John Wallace Pringle

Colonel Sir John Wallace Pringle CB, FRGS (1863 - 16 July 1938) was Chief Inspecting Officer of the Railways Inspectorate of the Ministry of Transport from 1916 to 1929. As such he was in charge of investigations into a number of serious railway accidents in the UK.
Early career.
Pringle became a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1883.
As an army officer, Pringle fought in the Third Anglo-Burmese War, 1885-1886.
In the Uganda railway survey between 1891 and 1892, Pringle was second in command to James Macdonald.
The survey's findings confirmed that the caravan route to the Great Rift Valley was the best path for the line, followed by the easiest gradient to be found over the Mau Escarpment and down to Lake Victoria. Macdonald and Pringle recommended construction of a three foot six inch gauge railway. They suggested that Kikuyuland would be a suitable place for whites to live, and their civilizing effect would drive out slavery, but the railway was needed to give access to the new colony.
Pringle became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.
He received the Gill Memorial from this society in 1895 for his work on the Uganda railway survey.
In 1896 he was appointed superintending engineer on the survey and construction of the Hyderabad-Godavari Valley Railway.
Inspecting officer.
Pringle had reached the rank of Major in 1900 when he was appointed an inspecting officer in the Board of Trade.
At the start of World War I in 1914, he was appointed a deputy director of railway transport with the temporary rank of Colonel.
In 1916 he was confirmed in this rank when he returned to the Board of Trade as Chief Inspecting Officer. When the Ministry of Transport was formed in 1919, he was transferred to the new ministry with his department, retaining his position as Chief Inspecting Officer until his retirement in 1929.
Pringle conducted various accident inquiries, including that into the Sevenoaks derailment of 24 August 1927. 
He chaired a committee to investigate the general adoption of automatic train control on British railways, following the adoption of an electro-mechanical system on the Great Western Railway (GWR), reporting in April 1922. 
He chaired a second committee on the same subject that reported in 1930, but little was done outside the GWR. 
He was Chairman of the Electrification of Railways Advisory Committee, which reported in 1928.
Pringle was made a Companion of the Bath in 1921, and was knighted in 1925. 
He died at Cuckfield, Sussex on 16 July 1938 at the age of 75.

Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site

Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site in Linn County, Missouri, is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site. Also called the Linn County Bridge, the site is located about west of Laclede. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At a length of with a width of it is the longest remaining covered bridge in the state. 
History.
In August 1868, a contract was awarded by the Linn County Commissioners to Bishop & Eaton for a bridge across Locust Creek, with the cost not to exceed 5,000 dollars. The structure is a Howe truss, constructed of white pine. Vertical iron rods tightly secure diagonal wooden beams to the bottom and top of the structure. In addition to its utilitarian function, over time the bridge was a hangout for locals with some proclaiming their love for one another and their presence at the bridge with carvings along the bridge's internal walls. The bridge over Locust Creek also proved a popular fishing spot for at least one Linn County boy. John J. Pershing, later one of America's most famous military leaders, grew up in nearby Laclede and often fished and swam at the bridge. Not far from the bridge is the Gen. John J. Pershing Boyhood Home State Historic Site as well as Pershing State Park. 
At first used only for wagon, horse, and pedestrian traffic, in the early 20th century the bridge would become a vital automotive link across northern Missouri, Route 8. However the age and narrow width made the bridge unsuitable for heavy vehicle traffic after a period and the bridge was bypassed with the completion of U.S. Route 36 in 1930. The bridge also runs parallel to the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad. After World War II, the course of Locust Creek was changed and the bridge spanned a dry creek bed. Over time the creek bed filled with silt, leaving the bridge resting on mud much of the time.
In 1968, the State of Missouri acquired the bridge and established the Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site, then repaired the bridge, replacing its roof, sheeting, and flooring. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The Missouri Department of Conservation undertook another major improvement in 1991, raising the bridge by six feet to protect the wooden frame and flooring from the marshy ground. The bridge site is open daily from sunrise to sunset. An informational kiosk is available to provide information about the bridge and its history. The site is managed from nearby Pershing State Park.

Martha Maxwell

Martha Maxwell (1831–1881) was a self-educated naturalist and artist born in Pennsylvania. who traveled to the Colorado Territory with the first wave of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1860. She helped found modern taxidermy. Martha was the first woman to collect and prepare her own skins and mounts, teaching herself from books after her husband James Maxwell refused, fearing she would do a better job than him because women were considered better with their hands. She discovered "Otus asio maxwelliae" (the Maxwell Owl) as well as a number of other species not previously known to live in the Colorado Territory. She represented Colorado at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Martha Maxwell was also a vegetarian throughout her life.
Life and Work.
Born in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, Martha was educated about nature from a young age by her grandmother Abigail, who would take her on walks in the woods, identifying birds, squirrels and wildlife in general.
In 1842, she, her mother and religious step-father Josiah Dartt, along with her grandmother Abigail and three brothers, set off for Oregon with the aim of converting Native Americans to Christianity. As with many pioneers, Abigail died of Malaria on the journey, and the family only reached Wisconsin, settling in Baraboo.
She studied at Oberlin College in Ohio, though unable to continue funding her studies, was forced to move back to Baraboo to teach for a living.
She married the relatively wealthy store and mill owner, James Alexander Maxwell, in 1853. James was ruined by the panic of 1857, and leaving her daughter Mabel behind in the care of her parents, she and James joined the Colorado Gold Rush of 1860, eventually settling in Nevadaville, Colorado, with James herding cattle, and her running a boardinghouse and eventually a mining claim.
Unfortunately, the boardinghouse burned down in 1861, and James and Martha moved to a cabin on land they had bought with savings. They were claim-jumped by an itinerant German taxidermist who took over the cabin. They took back the cabin, filled with the taxidermist's work, and returned the German's property to him. Martha was inspired by this episode and her opportunity to study the German's work, and resolved to take up taxidermy herself.
Writing to her family shortly afterwards, requesting a book on illustration "I wish to learn how to preserve birds and the other animal curiosities in this country".
On a long visit to Baraboo between 1864-1868, she studied taxidermy under a local man named Ogden, who had experience of stuffing animals. She developed new techniques, such as molding the shape of the animal in plaster before stretching the skin over. She also insisted that replica backgrounds portraying the animals' natural habitat were used. 
Eventually she returned to Colorado with her daughter Mabel, where she began taking long camping and hunting trips to further her work and study nature. Reporting back to Robert Ridgewell at the Smithsonian, sending specimens which were later to be classified as "Scops Asio var. Maxwell" (The Rocky Mountain Screech Owl) and gathering specimens later identified as the black-footed ferret.
She showed bravery in her dangerous expeditions, once climbing a high mountain in a thunderstorm in order to capture a Rock Ptarmigan. Once she was almost shot by a man who mistook her for a Native American. 
Martha was a strict vegetarian when at home, and took no joy in killing animals, writing "All must die sometime; I only shorten the period of consciousness that I may give their form perpetual memory.".

Long Branch State Park

Long Branch State Park is a state park in the US state of Missouri consisting of located in Macon County, adjacent to the Long Branch Reservoir. It is located two miles west of Macon, Missouri on U.S. Highway 36.
History.
Flooding along the Little Chariton River was an ongoing problem for the residents of Macon County and elsewhere in northeast Missouri since the area was first settled in the 1830s. Extensive channelization of the main Chariton river by private entities, local governments, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while alleviating flooding issues in some areas, exacerbated them for others. In the mi-1970s a project to solve the problem by damming the east fork of the Little Chariton was begun. Completed in 1978, a 71-foot-high earthen dam impounds water for flood control, public recreation, and wildlife conservation. Long Branch Lake is the reservoir created by the dam, with about 24 miles of shoreline and a flood-control capacity of 98,000 acre-feet. In addition to the adjacent state-run state park, the dam has a visitor's center at its southern end, and the Atlanta State Wildlife Area at its northern end near Atlanta, Missouri.
State park.
Long Branch State Park was created by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources in 1983 after reaching a long term lease agreement with the Corps of Engineers for use of the land.
It features a wide variety of outdoor activities:

John Otway Percy Bland

John Otway Percy Bland (1863–1945), a British writer and journalist, who wrote under the name J.O.P. Bland, was born on 15 November 1863 in Malta, the second son of the ten children of Major-General Edward Loftus Bland (1829–1923) and Emma Frances Franks (d. 1894). Best known as the author of a number of books on Chinese politics and history, he lived in China for most of the period 1883-1910. A planned career in law was curtailed while he was still at university, and his father arranged for him to be considered for an appointment in the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.
Career in China.
Bland arrived in China in 1883, and worked in the Customs from 1 July 1883 until 31 January 1896, serving in Hankou, Canton, and Peking, serving there as Inspector-General Sir Robert Hart's Private Secretary from 1894-96. From early in his career he began writing light verse about life amongst the foreign expatriate communities in the Chinese treaty ports, collected in "Lays of Far Cathay", in 1890. He married an American, Louisa Dearborn Nickels (b. c.1864), widow of M. C. Nickels and daughter of a Pacific Mail Line skipper, Captain H. C. Dearborn, in Shanghai on 29 November 1889.
In 1896 Bland resigned from the Customs to take up the position of Assistant Secretary to the Shanghai Municipal Council, which governed the Shanghai International Settlement, succeeding to the Secretaryship the following year on the retirement of the incumbent, R.F. Thorburn. This was not initially an onerous position, and Bland began to develop a parallel career as a free-lance journalist. As a Customs employee he had been forbidden from writing to or for the press, but now, as well as starting a humorous weekly, "The Rattle", he penned more light verse, and commenced an association with "The Times" as its Shanghai correspondent. "Verse and Worse" was published in 1902 with illustrations by Willard Dickerman Straight, who had joined the Customs in 1902, and with whom Bland struck up a friendship.
Bland began to get critically engaged in the politics of Britain's China policy, and was a vocal advocate of a forward policy, especially with the arrival on the scene in China of German interests after 1897. At Shanghai during his tenure of his post as chief administrator, the International Settlement expanded in size threefold, and Bland himself was active in the Shanghai Committee of the British China Association, which advocated a more aggressive policy in China than its parent committee in London. He left the Municipal Council in 1906 to take up a new position with the British and Chinese Corporation (BCC), formed largely by Jardine Matheson and by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1898, becoming its Peking-based agent conducting railway loan negotiations with the Chinese government. This ended in acrimony in 1910 as Bland's anti-German proclivities ran counter to the Bank's policy, and he was dismissed. The following year saw the termination of his relationship with "The Times". Since his move back to Peking Bland had assisted the paper's China correspondent George Ernest Morrison, who had no Chinese. Morrison eventually saw Bland as a rival and engineered his dismissal.
Return to Britain.
Bland returned to China just once more in 1920 before his death, but the years after he left were those which saw him carve out a new career as a freelance writer and commentator, mainly on Chinese affairs. As well as a succession of commentaries, "Recent Events and Present Policies in China" (1912); "China, Japan and Korea" (1921), he published more light fiction. He became best known, however, as co-author, with Sir Edmund Backhouse, of two best-selling accounts of recent Chinese history, "China under the Empress Dowager" (1910) and "Annals and Memoirs of the Court of Peking" (1914). Backhouse, already widely known as a Sinologist supplied the source materials for the volumes, while Bland, who had some talent as a writer, fashioned them into readable manuscripts. Unfortunately for Bland, Backhouse was a fantasist and forger, and attacks on the veracity of the key source used in "China under the Empress Dowager", the so-called 'Diary of His Excellency Ching-Shan', commenced even before it was published. To the end of his life Bland parried attacks on the books. British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper's 1978 biography clearly laid out the lifelong pattern of fraud, forgery and deceit that had mostly engaged Backhouse's energy.
Bland's reputation has been further tarnished by his furious denunciation of China's nationalist revolution, "" (1932). Its attacks on post-imperial China, on its new nationalist aspirations and politics have seen Bland roundly identified as the quintessential 'Old China Hand', and a reactionary, if not a racist; according to Hugh Roper, however, in his biography of Sir Edmund Backhouse, Bland's opposition to Chinese nationalist movements was based upon his belief that these movements were essentially unrealistic westernised elites attempting to impose a corrupt version of a foreign style of government on a China that was unprepared for such radical change. Roper maintains that Bland believed China would only restore its independence with a renewal of its own traditions and institutions in some form of monarchy supported by the peasantry, which Roper suggests ultimately became a reality in the form of Mao Tse-tung's communist "Empire". Bland was equally critical of British policy and British diplomats, attacking the 'Foreign Office School of Thought' in his reportage, and making fun of diplomatic life and loves in Peking in his lighter fiction.
Bland died on June 23, 1945 in Ipswich, Suffolk, England. His papers were later donated to the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto through the intercession of J.L. Cranmer-Byng.

<doc id="20918079" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20918079" title="Trust deed investment company">
Trust deed investment company

A licensed trust deed investment company (TDIC) offers investments in collateral-backed property loans in the United States. Unlike private individuals who are generally subject to usury laws limiting interest rates on loans, TDICs can legally lend to property owners at rates determined by market demand. Because TDICs usually lend to borrowers with needs banks cannot accommodate (e.g., fast turnaround, multiple-use real estate projects), market rates for trust deed investments are usually significantly higher than bank mortgage rates.
TDICs originate, underwrite, fund and service the loans for individual and/or group investors. Trust deed investors receive regular interest payments throughout the loan term and principal is repaid when the loan matures. In the event of default, TDICs generally manage workouts and, where necessary, foreclosure, on behalf of investors. Some TDICs have in-house real estate brokers who can re-sell REO in the event of foreclosure. Others may also have property management staff who can rent foreclosed properties on behalf of investors.
Licensing requirements for TDICs vary from state to state. Generally, TDIC activities are overseen by a state's governing real estate, lending or corporation authority, or some combination.
The private money loans provided by TDICs are also known as hard money loans—a reference to the hard assets that provide collateral for the loans. Hard money loans are usually short-term, bridge loans designed to meet temporary cash needs for projects that will eventually be refinanced with conventional bank loans.

David McKenzie (athlete)

David McKenzie (born 3 September 1970) is a British athlete who won the gold medal in the 4 x 400 metres relay at the 1994 Commonwealth Games held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, along with teammates, Peter Crampton, Adrian Patrick, and Du'aine Ladejo.
Early life.
McKenzie attended Ingram High School in Croydon, South London and trained with Croydon Harriers. On 11 Aug 1985 at Crystal Palace, just one month shy of his fifteenth birthday, he ran a time of 49.97s for the 400 metres, at the time the second fastest ever time for an under-15 athlete, and as at 2008 was still the third fastest time.
Senior career.
He reached his all time peak on 12 June 1994 when he ran 45.47s at Sheffield for Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers. This earned him a solid place in the England team for the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. At those games he was part of the 4x400 metres relay team that took gold (along with Peter Crampton, Adrian Patrick, and Du'aine Ladejo with Mark Smith and Alex Fugallo in earlier rounds). David also won a relay gold medal in the 1994 Helsinki European Championship 4x400 metres relay team alongside Brian Whittle, Roger Black and Du'aine Ladejo. McKenzie was to also feature in the season ending World Cup at Crystal Palace again winning gold in the 4 x 400 metres relay with team mates Du'aine Ladejo, Jamie Baulch and Roger Black.

Beaconsfield Club

The Beaconsfield Club was a London gentlemen's club, now dissolved, which was established in 1880 and was disbanded circa 1887-8. For most of its existence, between 1880 and 1887, it occupied 66-68 Pall Mall.
The Club was formally linked to the Conservative party, with members having to pledge allegiance to join. It was named in honour of Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield. It purchased its clubhouse from a Captain John Elliott, who had built it for the short-lived Junior Naval and Military Club, but went bankrupt as a direct result of constructing the building. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40605]
However, the Beaconsfield Club was not as successful as had been hoped, and was forced to leave the premises by 1887, closing within a year. The building in turn was then passed on to the equally short-lived Unionist Club.
Correspondence relating to the Beaconsfield Club is held by the University of Glasgow. [http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/resultsn.cfm?NID=10082&RID=]

The FJ Holden

The FJ Holden is a 1977 Australian film directed by Michael Thornhill. "The FJ Holden" is a snapshot of the life of young teenage men in Bankstown, New South Wales, Australia in the 1970s and deals with the characters' difficulty in reconciling mateship with respect for a girlfriend.
Debi Enker in "Australian Cinema" comments: ""The FJ Holden" presents the suburbs as a cultural and spiritual desert. It is a place where regular bouts with the bottle are the only antidote for lives without hope or direction."
The film initially received a R classification from the Australian Film Board of Review, but after an appeal to the censors it was revised to a M classification for moderate sex scenes and moderate course language. However, all states except Victoria and New South Wales exercised their right to override the Commonwealth decision and retained the R classification.
Plot.
Kevin (Paul Couzens) and his best mate Bob (Carl Stever) drive around Sydney trying to pick up girls in Kevin's FJ Holden. Kevin meets Anne (Eva Dickinson) at a party and she agrees to let him to drive her home. Bob joins the ride, and she has sex with both men. However, a relationship develops between Anne and Kevin and they go to restaurants, race cars, and get drunk. The romance falters, partly because Kevin let Bob watch them having sex in her bedroom. 
Drunk and upset, Kevin tries to talk to Bob, who is incapable of a serious conversation. Bob is secretly happy that he has his friend back, but neither is capable of saying what he feels.
Production.
The film originated with a series of comic poems from Terry Larsen. The budget was raised from Greater Union and the Australian Film Commission. It was shot in November and December 1976 in western Sydney. Most of the young actors were amateurs.
Reception.
"The FJ Holden" grossed $710,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $3,266,000 in 2009 dollars. This was despite the fact the film was rated "R" in several states. It sold to some overseas countries and eventually recovered its cost.
Home Media.
"The FJ Holden" was released on DVD with a new print by Umbrella Entertainment in November 2005. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the theatrical trailers, Australian trailers and audio commentary with Mike Thornhill moderated by Peter Galvin.

HammerFall discography

To give more exposure to their work and try for a professional recording deal, a short live performance was recorded and sent to the Dutch label, Vic Records. HammerFall soon received a deal and spent the whole of the following year writing the album "Glory to the Brave". The album was initially released in the Netherlands and obtained positive feedback; it is also worthy of notice that the band's mascot, the knight Hector, first appeared on the cover of this album.
As HammerFall grew in popularity, the time available for members of the band to dedicate to other projects became limited. Jesper and Glenn were committed to In Flames and Fredrik was committed to the thrash metal band "Beyond". Thus, the HammerFall's line-up soon underwent changes. Stefan Elmgren assumed the lead guitar and Patrik Räfling assumed the drums (they joined the band in the end of 1997 after the release of "Glory to the Brave" album) and Fredrik decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. This happened in may - 1997, when bassist Magnus Rosén joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the "Glory to the Brave" album (like the acoustic guitars on "I Believe") but only as a guest performer, not a member of the band.

Robert Morris Page

Robert Morris Page (2 June 1903 – 15 May 1992) was an American physicist who was a leading figure in the development of radar technology. Later, Page served as the Director of Research for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.
Life and career.
Page was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, the son of a Methodist minister. He attended Hamline University, a small Methodist-supported school in St. Paul. Originally intending to become a minister, he changed his studies to physics and in 1927 received his B.S. degree in this field. Page immediately joined the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C. as a junior physicist. Somewhat later he started part-time studies at George Washington University, eventually earning a M.S. degree.
Although Page had no formal education in electrical engineering, building radios had been his hobby since childhood. Assigned to the NRL Radio Division, he quickly gained the confidence of the Division Superintendent, A. Hoyt Taylor, by providing very creative solutions to a wide variety of problems.
Following an observation by Lawrence A. Hyland in 1930 of radio interference caused by a passing aircraft, Taylor and Leo C. Young began an internally funded, low-level project to develop a radio-detection apparatus based on continuous wave (CW) Doppler interference. Unsuccessful with the CW approach, in 1934 Young suggested using a pulsed transmitter, similar to one that the NRL had built in 1925 for the Carnegie Institution of Washington in measuring the altitude of the ionosphere. Taylor assigned Page to design an apparatus for testing this suggestion.
A 60-MHz (5.0-m) pulse-modulated transmitter was soon built; this generated 10-microsecond pulses with a wait-time of 90 microseconds between pulses. Using a large antenna atop the main NRL building and a separately located receiver modified to pass the pulse signals, Page began assembling the equipment. In December 1934, Page first successfully tested the apparatus, tracking an aircraft at up to one mile as it flew up and down the Potomac River. Although the detection range was small and the indications on the oscilloscope monitor were almost indistinct, it represented a proof of the basic concept.
Based on this, Page, Taylor, and Young are generally credited with developing the world's first radar system. (RADAR is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging. Thus, to be called a "radar," a system must both detect a target and measure the range to the target. Many earlier systems had functioned only to detect without measuring range.)
After the successful demonstration of the concept, in 1935 the U.S. Senate appropriated $100,000 for further research and development of the system, now classified as Secret. Page spent much of the year improving the bandwidth and sensitivity of the receiver. In June 1936, the NRL's first prototype radar system, now operating at 28.6 MHz, was demonstrated to government officials, successfully tracking an aircraft at distances up to 25 miles.
This equipment required large antennas, making it impractical for ship mounting. Attention was then given to increasing the system operating frequency and, subsequently, decreasing the antenna size (antenna size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency). For the follow-on system, the frequency was raised to 200 MHz, the limit for transmitter tubes and other components at that time; this allowed the antenna to be greatly reduced in size.
Page and Young developed another important unit, the duplexer. This device allowed a common antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving. With other improvements, a full prototype system was first tested at sea on the USS Leary in April 1937. Initially designated the XAF, the system was improved and tested, then placed into production as the CXAM radar, the first such system deployed by the U.S. Navy starting in May 1940. (The acronym RADAR was coined by the Navy at that time as a cover for the highly classified work in this new technology.)
Page, together with the staff at the NRL, made many other major contributions to the overall evolution of radar. In addition to the duplexer, another major invention was the ring oscillator, an arrangement that allowed multiple power tubes to function as one in a transmitter and greatly increasing the power. Still another was the plan position indicator (PPI), proving the well-known circular presentation on the screen of a cathode-ray tube.
When the high-power cavity magnetron from Great Britain was introduced into America by the Tizard Mission in 1940, Page turned his attention to microwave radar and, working with the MIT Radiation Laboratory and the Bell Telephone Laboratories, made invaluable contributions to this new technology. One of the most significant was a system that greatly improved the angular accuracy of tracking radars. Called monopulse radar, it was first demonstrated in 1943. This highly complex technology was later used in the AN/FPS-16, likely the most popular tracking radar in history.
Following WWII, the NRL returned to performing a wide variety of basic and applied research for all parts of the Navy. Page participated broadly in these activities and in 1957 was named the NRL Director of Research. He served in this position until he retired in 1966. In his four decades at the NRL, he was awarded 65 patents, 40 directly in radar, more than any other person or group of persons.
Recognition.
For his accomplishments at the Naval Research Laboratory, Page was recognized by three Presidents:
In 1957, he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In 1979, Page was inducted into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame. He was awarded the D.Sc. "Honorius Causa" degree by Hamline University.
The Institute of Radio Engineers recognized Page with the 1953 Harry Diamond Memorial Award for "outstanding contributions to the development of radar.
Personal.
A devout Christian and creationist, Page lectured on the relationship of science and Biblical scripture throughout his career. Page died of heart failure in 1992 at Edina, Minnesota.

The region is famous for a peculiar mountain where charoite has been mined for decades. This intensely purple mineral, named after the river, is only found here and was discovered in the 1940s when a rail tunnel was constructed.

"NME" gave it a score of seven out of ten and said that "Farrar has the passion to carry the songs beyond any hackneyed themes." Other reviews are average or mixed: "Mojo" gave the album three stars out of five and said, "By focusing on the temporal, reduces himself to simple protest music rather than timeless folk." "The New York Times" gave it an average review and said, "The band's underlying, stubborn seriousness, and nearly Amish unwillingness to change, creates its appeal." "Blender", however, gave it two stars out of five and said that Farrar had "never tried so actively to fuse prescriptive politics into [the mix, and the move feels suspect."

Helios Overture

Carl Nielsen's Helios Overture, Opus 17, was first performed by the Royal Orchestra, conducted by Johan Svendsen, on 8 October 1903 in the large hall of the Odd Fellows Mansion in Copenhagen.
Overview.
Besides his well-known six symphonies, the Danish composer Carl Nielsen wrote many short orchestral works, one of the most famous being "Helios Overture". In 1902, Nielsen signed a contract with the publisher Wilhelm Hansen, which allowed him to go to Athens, Greece, to join his wife Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, who was one of the first sculptors allowed to make copies of the bas-reliefs and statues in the Acropolis Museum.
Anne Marie, who had been granted the Ancker Award, was studying Greek art, while Nielsen, being a man of many interests, was interested in Archaeology. The local conservatory placed a study room with a piano at Carl Nielsen’s disposal. Here he could sit and compose when he was not on excursions in the surrounding mountains with or without Anne Marie. 
Nielsen's stay in Athens gave him the inspiration of a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the Aegean Sea, an overture which he called "Helios". He began work on it in March 1903, and finished it on April 23 the same year.
The score is written for three flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.
The work begins as the sun ascends over the Aegean Sea, while strings, divided horns and woodwind sound a melody. This rises out of the darkness to a full orchestra, where fanfaring trumpets begin a striding theme, which returns later in the piece. From there woodwinds begin a graceful tune, from which brass sound. Strings begin to play, which draws the orchestra into a reprise of the striding theme and its fanfare. In the final measures, the music subsides as the sun sinks over the horizon of the sea. The average playing time is between ten and twelve minutes.
On the score, Nielsen wrote:
"Silence and darkness,
The sun rises with a joyous song of praise,
It wanders its golden way
and sinks quietly into the sea." 
After a trip to Turkey, Carl and Anne Marie Nielsen traveled through Italy and reached Copenhagen by the end of July. The "Helios Overture" was successfully performed in Copenhagen on 8 October 1903, with Johan Svendsen conducting, though the reviews were mixed. Carl Nielsen performed Helios several times. The first was an evening concert dedicated to his compositions at the Odd Fellow Mansion on 11 November 1905 and the last performance was on 12 February 1930 in Gothenburg, Sweden. He also played the overture in Helsinki, Stockholm and Berlin. 
Being a great showpiece for orchestra, it has been one of Nielsen's most famous works ever since.
Performances today.
On the basis of information from the Carl Nielsen Society, the Helios Overture is currently one of Nielsen's most widely performed works.

Aplasia cutis congenita

Aplasia cutis congenita (also known as "Cutis aplasia," "Congenital absence of skin," and "Congenital scars") is the most common congenital cicatricial alopecia, and is a congenital focal absence of epidermis with or without evidence of other layers of the skin.
It can be associated with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, trisomy 13, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.
It is also seen with exposure to Methimazole and/or Carbimazole in utero. This dermatological manifestation has been linked to Peptidase D haploinsufficiency and a deletion in Chromosome 19.
Genetics.
This condition has been linked to mutations in the ribosomal GTPase BMS1 gene.

Charles Leigh (American football)

Charles Irving "Charlie" Leigh (October 29, 1945 – October 26, 2006) is a former National Football League (NFL) running back. He is best known for backing up Mercury Morris and Jim Kiick and returning kicks for the Miami Dolphins' back to back Super Bowl champions in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. He also played for the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. He played a total of six seasons in the NFL despite never playing college ball.
Career.
He began his NFL career with the 1968 Cleveland Browns after playing high school football at Albany High School in Albany, New York without having ever played college football. As a running back, he rushed 23 times for 144 yards, a 6.3 yards per carry average, and he scored one touchdown. His number of carries, total rushing yards and yards per carry average all proved to be career highs. He was also used extensively as a kick returner. He returned 14 kickoffs for 322 yards, a 23.0 yard per return average. And he returned 14 punts for 76 yards, a 5.4 yard per return average. Leigh led the Browns and placed 13th in the NFL in both yards per kickoff return and yards per punt return in 1968. Leigh played for the Cleveland Browns in 1969 as well, but received little time at running back and did not carry the ball the entire season, although he did catch two passes. He did return five punts for 18 yards and two kickoffs for six yards that season.
Leigh did not play in the NFL in 1970, but played for the American Football Conference champion Miami Dolphins in 1971. For the Dolphins that season he rushed just five times for 15 yards and returned just four kickoffs for 99 yards, although he played in all 14 games.
Leigh became the primary punt returner for the famous 1972 Miami Dolphins team that had a perfect season and won Super Bowl VII. Leigh returned 22 punts for 210 yards and a 9.5 yard average for the 1972 Dolphins. The 22 punts returned ranked 5th in the NFL that season, and the 210 yards and 9.5 average each ranked 6th in the NFL that season. Leigh also returned six kickoff 153 yards, a 25.5 yard average, and rushed 21 times for 79 yards, a 3.8 yard average. Leigh got to play in Miami's 14-7 Super Bowl victory over the Washington Redskins, but did not have any carries or returns.
Leigh had one of his most productive seasons in 1973 for the Dolphins, another Super Bowl championship team. Leigh rushed 22 times for 134 yards for a 6.1 yards per carry average with one touchdown. His yards per carry average was second on the team to Mercury Morris' league leading 6.4. He also returned nine kickoffs for 251 yards, for a 27.9 average that would have ranked 6th in the NFL had he had enough returns to qualify for the league leaders. He also had nine punt returns for 64 yards, for a 7.1 average.
1974 was Leigh's final NFL season. He played one game for the Dolphins before moving to the Green Bay Packers. He played 10 games for the Packers. For the season, he returned 11 kickoffs, all but two for the Packers, for 251 yards and a 22.8 yard average. He also carried the ball one time for the Packers but did not gain any yards.
Career stats.
For his career, Leigh rushed 72 times for 372 yards, a 5.2 yards per carry average and two touchdowns. The 5.2 yards per carry average was better than several of his more celebrated teammates, including Hall of Famer Leroy Kelly (4.2), Hall of Famer Larry Csonka (4.3), 3 time Pro Bowler Mercury Morris (5.1) and 2 time Pro Bowler Jim Kiick (3.7). He also returned 46 kickoffs for 1082 yards and a 23.5 yards per return average, and returned 50 punts for 368 yards and a 7.4 yards per return average.
Death.
Leigh died of lung cancer on October 26, 2006.

Mark Wylde

Mark Wylde (né Daniel Lamb) was a fictional character in the British soap opera "Emmerdale" played by Maxwell Caulfield. He made his first appearance on 15 January 2009 and departed on 14 January 2010.
In early December 2009, it was announced that Caulfield had quit the show and would depart shortly. Producers promised a "stunning exit storyline" which would see a who-dunnit type storyline in which Mark would be killed. Mark was murdered by his wife, Natasha Wylde, on-screen (although only the audience knew of Natasha's guilt) on 14 January 2010. The murder storyline saw the revelation of Mark and Faye's affair, that Mark is Ryan's biological father (meaning that he is Maisie's brother), and Natasha found out about Mark's cheating, giving them all motives for murder. The storyline reached its climax in mid-October, which saw Natasha confess to Mark's killing and sentenced to 21 years imprisonment and Ryan leaving the village for a fresh start.
Character creation and development.
Casting.
The characters of Mark and Natasha Wylde were announced in September 2008, with Maxwell Caulfield and Amanda Donohoe announced as the actors portraying them. They started filming in October 2008, and were originally thought to be first appearing on 25 December 2008, but this was later changed to 15 January 2009.
Caulfield said that the role was "just too tempting to turn down and I can't wait to start filming in the beautiful Yorkshire countryside". 
Anita Turner, the series producer, said she was "thrilled to be welcoming two actors of such high calibre to the cast". He described the character as "fun to play".
Amanda Donohoe said that the Wyldes are "self-made millionaires, they're very well-to-do", and although not looking for retirement they do want a "break from the big city". She also said that the couple have been married for 25 years and have two grown-up children and a nine-year old. Caulfield said that there is a "hidden side to Mark that will come out over time". Although he is an "out-and-out charmer" he is one of those people whose "sincerity you have to question", he said.
Departure.
In October 2009 after less than a year in the show Maxwell Caulfield quit the show due to fear of being type cast it was announced that the character would be killed off and made his last appearance on 14 January 2010.
Storylines.
2009–10.
Mark and Natasha first appear on horseback riding into the village to meet Bishop George, who is waiting to hand over the keys of St. Mary's Church, which they have bought in addition to Home Farm. All three then head to "The Woolpack", where they are given an unfriendly welcome, as their buying the church means Ashley and Laurel Thomas have to leave the village. However, Natasha announces that they bought the church and vicarage to give back to the community - making them instantly popular. However, Natasha had not discussed this with Mark before announcing it, but later assures him that it was necessary to keep the villagers on side.
A couple of months after the arrival of the Wyldes, Faye Lamb turned up in the village after seeing Mark's photo in a magazine profile of the family. Mark saw her several times, and eventually they had a long conversation in the woods. He apologised for the way he treated her in the past and put her up in an expensive flat. In late May, it was revealed that Mark was married to Faye, making his marriage to Natasha bigamous, and his real name was Daniel Lamb. He went missing twenty-seven years ago, after going to pick up a friend from the station, and never returned. They were in serious debt as his company had just gone bankrupt. His parents never recovered from the shock and died shortly afterwards. Faye had Daniel declared legally dead seven years later. He moved to France and later set up a new identity - Mark Wylde. Faye was not sure if she was pregnant at the time and consequently did not tell him. A week later he found out that he and Faye had a son, Ryan Lamb.
In late June, Faye told Natasha everything about Mark's previous life, Natasha was very hurt and angry with Mark that she had been lied to for more than 20 years. Faye, angered by Mark and Natasha's behaviour, moved into the village with Ryan, wanting them to get to know each other. Natasha, however, insisted that Mark arrange a job for Ryan in Dubai, which he initially did but later withdrew only days before Ryan was due to leave, as he had bonded with Ryan. Natasha was not happy, warning Mark that it was only a matter of time before the truth came out.
In early January Mark and Faye were planning to get back together. Despite earlier plans, they decided to leave things as they were, aware of how much pain they would cause to their children. But Natasha guessed what Mark was doing and confronted them, just as they were making plans for Faye to move on. Faye told her this but Natasha refused to believe it, leading to a row. By this time Ryan and Maisie had started a secret relationship. However, while they are up in Ryan's bedroom they hear voices rowing downstairs, which they soon realise are Natasha, Mark and Faye. They come downstairs and announce that they are dating. Natasha, Mark and Faye explain to that they can't because they are half brother and sister and tell them that Mark is a bigamist. Both Ryan and Maisie are devastated and angry. After Natasha orders him to leave, Mark writes a suicide note that evening and goes out to the woods with a shotgun. Natasha finds the note and heads out to the woods and persuades him to give her the gun. But upon hearing him saying that he was not going to run away anymore, she shoots him with the shotgun and buries his body. His final words were, "I've made a decision. Let's go home." Natasha said in response, "You don't get to make decisions anymore, Mark..." before shooting him dead with the shotgun, killing him instantly. As the camera pans to the sky the gunshot can be heard. Natasha panics and she buries Mark's body, off-screen..
Almost six months later, Mark's body was discovered by Sam Dingle (James Hooton), who was walking his dog in woodland. Sam called the police, who identified the skeleton as that of Mark's. Natasha played the devastated widow, claiming that she'd been away at the time Mark was murdered. Natasha and Nathan framed Ryan Lamb (James Sutton) who was charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Maisie however proved that Ryan couldn't have killed Mark as he was with her, trying to come to terms that he'd just slept with his secret half-sister.
After her eldest son was kidnapped by Cain Dingle, who was hell-bent on exposing Mark's killer. Natasha breaks down and confesses to the murder. She is arrested by Nick Henshall and placed into police custody to await sentencing. On 24 November 2010 Natasha was sentenced to Life imprisonment with a minimum term of 21 years. Natasha is expected to be released in 2031.
Reception.
Prior to the Wyldes' first appearance, the News of the World described their arrival in the village as a "Don't miss" TV moment of the week. Simon Swift, in his Soaplife blog criticised Emmerdale for not being "more radical" in their new characters.

Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche

Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche (1875) LR 7 HL 653 is a UK company law case, which concerned the objects clause of a company.
Its importance has been diminished as a result of the Companies Act 2006 s 31, which allows for unlimited objects for which a company may be run. Furthermore, any limits a company does have in its objects clause has no effect whatsoever for people outside a company (s 39 CA 2006), except as a general issue of authority of the company's agents.
Facts.
Incorporated under the Companies Act 1862, the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd’s memorandum, clause 3, said its objects were ‘to make and sell, or lend on hire, railway-carriages…’ and clause 4 said activities beyond needed a special resolution. But the company agreed to give Riche and his brother a loan to build a railway in Belgium. Later, the company refused the agreement. Riche sued, and the company pleaded the action was ultra vires.

The House of Lords, agreeing with the three dissentient judges in the Exchequer Chamber, pronounced the effect of the Companies Act to be the opposite of that indicated by Mr Justice Blackburn.

Conflict (album)

Conflict is the third studio album by American R&B/soul singer, Sy Smith. The album was officially released on April 1, 2008, in United States.
Overview.
Recording.
During Smith's 2007 tour, Sy Smith recorded new material for her third studio album. With the release of a buzz single "Reach Down In Your Soul" and a music video to follow its release, the album was announced. The song "Would All The People From Compton Please Leave?" was a cover version of soul singer Minnie Riperton's "Baby, This Love I Have". According to Sy Smith, the song "Spies" is about: 
Singles.
In mid-2007, Smith released a buzz single "Ain't Nobody's Bizness". In late 2007, Smith released another buzz single "Reach Down In Your Soul", which featured Wes Felton. Smith also released a music video for the song. In April 2008, Smith released her third studio album, "Conflict", with "Fly Away With Me" as the lead single. The song "Fly Away With Me" charted at #38 on the Top 40 Hot Adult R&B Chart. The music video aired on BET's "Centric Hits" and "Soul Sessions". In September 2008, Smith and her band Deeznuts performed at Temple Bar's Farewell Show. Smith performed a seven track set-list. She also released the title-track "Conflict" as the second single and the music video premiered at Temple Bar.
In February 2009, Smith released the third single "Spies", and the music video aired on Logo Network. The music video also features the cast of TV-series Noah's Arc. In August 2009, Smith released the fourth single "B-Side Love Affair" and the music video aired on YouTube. In 2010, she appeared on Fox DC to promote her fifth single "The Art of You".
Commercial success.
In late 2008, "Conflict" received an "Album of the Year" nomination from Soultracks. The album has sold over 50,000 copies in United States.
Critical response.
The album "Conflict" received a positive review from Billboards. According to a writer of Billboards who says, "Like its predecessors, "Conflict" finds Smith skillfully fusing R&B/soul and jazz into spacey concoctions accented by tempo shifts and insightful metaphors. Gliding over, under and around the tracks are Smith's captivatingly sly, sultry vocals." From JazzandSoul.eu, "Sy Smith, as mentioned, masters in presenting all different tastes of music and tempos. Ain't nobody's Bizness as a perfect crossover between old school and nu school soul, funky and mysterious in Reach down in your Soul. On B - side love Affair, soul romanticism even flirts with drum 'n bass in this unusual but splendid cut. The fantastic aspect on Conflict is that this album doesn't contain any 'ueseless' filling. All compositions are of an enormous high level, brought by a singer with a tremendous voice, an eye for original words and unique creativity. If you get a chance to get your hands on a copy of Conflict, certainly do so. A highly recommended CD.". 
Howard Dukes of Soultracks.com stated, " 'This is crazy/This is sane, Can they be one in the same?/This is legal/It's a crime/This is gonna do hard time/This is funny/This is sad/This is making me feel bad.' This is what songwriting is supposed to achieve - employing a totally funky beat to issue a thoroughly provocative message. It would be tough to make an album filled with songs that maintain that level of quality and intensity while staying true to the groove, but Smith comes awfully close. There is no filler on Conflict. In fact, Smith uses the rest of the album to display the type of diversity in tempo and topics that soul fans expect from those who operate at the top of the game." 
Norman Mayers of Nu-Soul Magazine said, "There is no doubt that Sy Smith is what Nu-Soul is all about. She is an artist who draws inspiration from the traditions of jazz and soul yet pushes the sound into new territories by experimenting with new genres. For open-minded soul lovers, Conflict will definitely hit all the right notes."
Tour.
In 2008, Smith began her touring along with her band "Deeznuts" at local venues and events like Temple Bar, The Mint, I Got Soul Conference 2008, and Jazzy Summer Nights. In June 2009, Smith toured along with Yahzarah, Conya Doss, and Maya Azucena during the Soulsista Tour. The tour's last show ended on June 28, 2009. In July 2009, Smith also performed along with Yahzarah, Conya Doss, and Ra-Re Valverde at the Soul Uprising Show at B.B. Kings in New York. In August 2009, Smith resumed her own tour, which ended in December 2009.

Personal numbering

Personal numbering is the name for virtual telephone number services in a number of countries including the UK and Spain. Typically the national destination code used for this service is (0)70 service. This service has historically been poorly defined by Oftel and also Ofcom. In 2008, Ofcom has made an in depth study into the service and proposed keeping the service and not migrating it to 060.
The 070 service is based on the principle of a flexible virtual telephone number. Depending on the telecommunications service provider, these numbers are able to be remotely commanded, by Web, SMS or IVR to route calls to most international destinations, including mobiles. They are similar to follow-me numbers, but are able to be controlled remotely and push calls to the desired destination. For example, the UK number +44 70 0585 0070 is routed to an Inmarsat number, so that the subscriber can be reached anywhere on Earth just as if he were still in the United Kingdom. For the telephone numbering plan context of 070 numbers see Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom.

In 1991 AT&T ran a trial which led, in 1992, to the "AT&T EasyReach 700" service of follow-me numbers, on area code 700 in the North American Numbering Plan.
Early days.
After protracted lobbying of Oftel throughout 1992, Stanford White (of Numbering Viewed Worldwide Ltd) and Will Goodall (of Goodall Personal Numbering Ltd, renamed FleXtel in 1994) were each licensed by the DTI (now BERR) in mid-1993, under section 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, to provide telecommunications services.
The UK's first commercial personal numbering service was launched by FleXtel in December 1993, by piggy-backing onto the Mercury One2One GSM network on the old One2One 09567 range.
070 introduction.
In 1995 the UK telecoms regulator, Oftel (now Ofcom), reserved the whole of the 070 range exclusively for personal numbering, imitating the USA area code 700 and ensuring adequate number availability for the future. This regulatory intervention was supported by FleXtel, despite having to migrate its existing customers from the old 0956 7xxxxx numbers to new 070 107x xxxx numbers. However, the old numbers were permitted to operate in parallel for over two years after the change.
070 early competition.
FleXtel was the first to launch, closely followed by the Personal Number Company (now PNC Telecom ), initially run using Vodafone's GSM network. BT then entered the market with Flexinumber, followed by Redstone's Callsure service. The Personal Number Company later acquired BT's Flexinumber customer base and BT withdrew from the personal numbering market.
070 scams.
Increasing termination rate.
Due to changes in the market in the mid '90s, largely driven by Redstone, Orange and Vodafone increasing termination rates to premium rate levels, the 070 range has become dogged by scams.
Oftel's response.
In 2001 Oftel consulted on the introduction of Personal Numbering guidelines and banning end user call revenue share.
Ofcom's response.
In 2008, Ofcom acknowledged that personal numbering delivers a valuable service to specialist applications, it continues to receive a bad press due to weak enforcement and very poor price transparency for call origination. These issues continue to challenge Ofcom in both the 070 and 08x ranges and the situation is an ongoing balance between tactical enforcement and strategic regulation.

Osage Village State Historic Site

Osage Village State Historic Site in Vernon County, Missouri, is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site. It was once the site of around 200 lodges and the home of 2,000 to 3,000 people.
History.
The Osage Indians were first recorded in 1673 by explorers Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette. The territory claimed by the Osage at its greatest influence was vast and consisted of what is now southern Missouri, Arkansas, eastern Kansas and Oklahoma. Between 1700 and 1775, a group of the Osage lived on a high, open hilltop near the Osage River valley that today has been preserved as Osage Village State Historic Site.
At its height, the village contained 2,000 to 3,000 people and about 200 lodges. Pottery, weapons and tools excavated from the site have provided information about the daily lives of the villagers, who hunted, planted crops, processed hides and were very successful traders with the Europeans. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Osage Indians accounted for more than half of the total trade in furs along the Missouri River.
After the United States government took control of the Louisiana Purchase territory in 1804, the Osage Indians were gradually forced to retreat to Oklahoma. Through excavations they obtained information that demonstrated the shape of the house, which was rectangular.

Natasha Wylde

Natasha Jane Wylde is a fictional character from the British soap opera "Emmerdale" played by Amanda Donohoe. She made her first appearance, along with her husband Mark Wylde, on 15 January 2009. It was announced in July 2010 that Donohoe had quit her role as Natasha, and would leave the series later in the year. She made her final appearance on 24 November 2010.
Creation and development.
The characters of Mark and Natasha Wylde were announced in September 2008, with Maxwell Caulfield and Amanda Donohoe announced as the actors portraying them. They started filming in October 2008, and were originally thought to be first appearing on 25 December 2008, but this was later changed to 15 January 2009.
The casting of Amanda Donohoe, a well-known name in the United Kingdom and a Golden Globe Award-winning actress, caused press interest with Donohoe doing many interviews prior to her character's first appearance. In one interview she defended soap actors and said that it is a "huge privilege" to be on the screen of "eight million people five days a week". Describing being asked to take the part, Donohoe said, "I would have been stupid to say no. I am quite excited because I pretty much take over the village and cause a lot of trouble", also saying in another interview that she was "flattered" to be asked to join the soap. In an interview with the "Daily Express", the actress said that although she was flattered they wanted to create a role for her, it was "a hell of a challenge". Anita Turner, the series producer, said she was "thrilled to be welcoming two actors of such high calibre to the cast".
Describing her character she said Natasha is "not a classic soap 'bitch'" and described her as "humorous, witty and strong" but would "rub people up the wrong way". Amanda Donohoe said that the Wyldes are "self-made millionaires, they're very well-to-do", and although not looking for retirement they do want a "break from the big city". Donohoe said that the character is "a mum with three kids so she's not a single-minded, nasty person - she's witty and confident". Donohoe said the couple have been married for 25 years, and have two grown-up children and a nine-year old.
Storylines.
Mark and Natasha first appear on horseback, going to meet Bishop George, who will give them the keys to St. Mary's Church and Home Farm, as they are the new owners. All three head to "The Woolpack", where they receive an unpleasant welcome, as the fact they bought the church means Ashley and Laurel Thomas were having to leave. However, Natasha announces that they bought the church and vicarage to return it to the community - making them instantly popular.
Bigamy.
In late June, Natasha discovers Mark is married to Faye Lamb. Mark, real name Daniel Lamb, went missing twenty-seven years ago. He told Faye that he was going to collect a friend from the station and never returned. They were in serious debt as his company had gone bankrupt. His parents never recovered and died shortly after Faye had Daniel declared legally dead. Unaware of this and the fact that Faye was expecting their child, he moved to France and set up a new identity - Mark Wylde. 
Natasha was very hurt, knowing her marriage was a lie. She left briefly but returned, deciding not to end things with Mark. However, she insisted that Mark's past was kept a secret, paying Faye to leave after threatening to report her for insurance fraud. Faye, however, angered by Mark and Natasha's behaviour, moved to the village with Ryan, wanting Mark and Ryan to get to know each other. Natasha, wanting them to leave, got Mark to arrange a job in Dubai for Ryan after he made friends with his half-brothers. However, Mark wanted Ryan to stay and withdrew the Dubai job, much to Natasha and Ryan's horror. 
Maisie, however, struggled to cope with Faye and Ryan's presence. She saw Faye as the woman determined to break up her family, thinking Mark and Faye had had an affair. The affair was over and Natasha had forgiven Mark. Maisie also forgave him, on the understanding that he wouldn't hurt her mother again. They became reluctant friends, due to both making an effort to get on as Ryan was dating Katie Sugden.
Murder.
During December 2009, Ryan and Maisie got closer. They spent more time together and Maisie helps him choose a Christmas present for Katie. Eventually they realize they have romantic feelings for each other and, after Nathan sees them kissing, Ryan ends things with Katie and they start dating. 
Meanwhile, Mark and Faye were also planning to get back together but changed their minds, aware of the pain that would be caused. Natasha caught them kissing and confronted them, leading to a row. All three were horrified to see Ryan and Maisie come downstairs and announce their new relationship. They were relieved to hear that they hadn't slept together and Natasha told them that they were related. Neither took the news well so Faye and Natasha concentrated on taking care of their children and asked Mark to leave. Nathan was furious when he heard Ryan call Mark Dad but went to look after Maisie and his mother. Mark tried explaining but no one wanted to listen so when they left, he went to the woods with a shotgun. Natasha found him and, scared he would shoot himself, persuaded him to give her the gun. But listening to Mark talk about how he was tired of running, infuriated Natasha so much that she shot him and buried his body in the woods. Returning to the house, she told her children that Mark has left and she has no idea where he is. On 28 January, Faye reported Mark's disappearance. They question Natasha, who tells them about Mark's life as Daniel Lamb and that he is a bigamist.
Nathan is suspicious of Natasha's erratic behaviour, following Mark's disappearance, and she eventually tells Nathan that she killed him. Initially furious, he tried digging up Mark's body but agreed to keep Natasha's secret for the sake of his siblings and on condition that Natasha gives him her money. She does and Nathan leaves the village for London. Businessman Declan Macey buys a 51% share of Home Farm Estate. He and Natasha later start dating. Nathan returns in May and takes an instant dislike of Declan. He demands that Natasha end things with Declan and buy him out but she refuses. Nathan threatens to report her to the police for Mark's murder but backs down when Natasha tells him she'll report him for helping cover the murder up. Nathan returns Natasha's money and starts running the Estate with Natasha and Declan.
In June, Sam Dingle finds Mark's wallet. His half-brother, Cain, uses Mark's credit card to send the family some flowers. Natasha initially thinks Nathan sent the flowers and throws them at his car when he pulls up outside the house. Cain also sends one of Mark's suits to Declan, who demands the truth from the Wyldes. Natasha later arranges to meet Cain after Nathan tells her that he is the blackmailer and he demands money but she refuses. Will later goes missing and Natasha thinks that he has been kidnapped. She and Nathan later discover that Cain took Will and Belle to the cafe for ice cream. Thankful that Will is safe, Natasha pays Cain to stay away from them. 
In July 2010, Nathan and Natasha plan to frame Faye for Mark's murder. Natasha agrees to the plan, believing Mark's death would have never happened if Faye hadn't come to the village. On 26 July, Sam's dog, Alfie, finds Mark's body. The police found Mark's watch and other evidence to identify the body. The police ask Natasha if Mark had a pin in his knee, which she confirms and also confirms that the body is Mark's. Natasha tells her children that their father is dead and is devastated at the hurt and pain she has caused them. 
Framed by Nathan, Ryan is arrested and charged with murder. Later, Maisie leaves the village, believing Ryan is innocent. She thinks Nathan killed Mark, and Natasha is covering for him. Declan loses faith in Natasha and dumps her, agreeing with Maisie. Declan refuses Natasha and Nathan's offer to buy him out of Home Farm, believing that the Wyldes will soon be leaving. Maisie returns and visits Natasha, demanding she explain why she is covering for Nathan, staying with Faye. Natasha visits her but argues with Faye, telling her that Mark would still be alive if she hadn't come to the village. Faye slaps her and Natasha walks away but Faye shouts after her that she and Nathan will never be free of their guilt.
Natasha gives evidence at Ryan's trial. She falters on reading the oath but gives a convincing performance as a grieving widow. During the trial, Nathan is kidnapped by Cain, who intended to torture him to get a confession. Natasha tries contacting Nathan but does not get a reply. On 26 October 2010, Ryan is found guilty and as she leaves the court, Maisie confronts Natasha and again accuses her of covering for Nathan, and as good as killing Ryan. Natasha goes home to discover Will has returned from staying with a family friend and finds Cain in the kitchen. He reveals he kidnapped Nathan and has left Maisie with him, taking Natasha and Will to the barn where he is holding Nathan captive and after hearing Nathan scream, Natasha finds Maisie about to hit Nathan with a piece of wood. Nathan told Maisie that Natasha had killed Mark but Maisie didn't believe him. Thinking Nathan committed the murder, she asks Natasha to stop covering for Nathan. Natasha then confesses that she killed Mark but Will overhears her confession. Natasha gives Maisie her mobile phone and tells her that her fate is in her hands. Maisie calls the police, despite Natasha and Nathan's suggestions of a fresh start and blaming Cain for forcing her to confess but she refuses. Natasha apologizes to Maisie and goes to hug Will to tell him that she still loves him but Will rejects her, saying he doesn't want her love, he wants his father back. The police arrive and Natasha is arrested and taken away. The following day, Maisie visits Natasha in prison and demands the whole truth. Natasha tells Maisie that she acted alone but Maisie refuses to believe her. Natasha asks Maisie to bring Will on her next visit but Maisie says that neither of them want to see her again. Natasha is then escorted to her cell by a prison guard. The door is shut and locked. Natasha sits down on a chair and resigns herself to her fate.
On 24 November 2010, Natasha is sentenced to life imprisonment for Mark's murder and ordered by the judge to serve a minimum term of 21 years before being considered for parole. Nathan attends Natasha's sentencing and is shocked by the length of the sentence. Faye also attends the sentencing. As Natasha is led away, she mouths the word "sorry" to Nathan. Natasha is last seen being escorted into prison by guards. Natasha is not eligible for parole until 2031.
Reception.
Prior to the Wyldes' first appearance, the "News of the World" described their arrival in the village as a "Don't miss" TV moment of the week. Simon Swift, in his "Soaplife" blog criticised "Emmerdale" for not being "more radical" in their new characters, rather than having another "bitch" stereotype, although he said if Natasha was to "reach the heights of Kim Tate - we'll all be happy". Swift was, however, thankful that the character was not "another Dingle".

Dewey Readmore Books

Dewey Readmore Books (circa November 1987 – November 29, 2006) was the resident cat at the Spencer Public Library in Spencer, Iowa, garnering worldwide publicity. The cat's story was the subject of a book, "", published in 2008 and written by Spencer librarian Vicki Myron.
Biography.
In January 1988, on a freezing winter evening, someone left an eight-week old male kitten in the outside book drop at the Spencer Public Library. The library staff discovered the kitten the next morning. The kitten was badly frostbitten and so filthy that everyone thought he was grey instead of his natural copper and white. Although the entire staff cared for him, library director Vicki Myron took primary responsibility. Because the veterinarian declared that he was about 8 weeks old, Vicki and others decided arbitrarily that his birthday would be said to be November 18, 1987.
Although some libraries have had a tradition of resident cats, this was the first such cat in Spencer, so approval was required from both the board of trustees of the library and the Spencer City Council. Once they approved, the kitten was vaccinated and neutered. Thereafter, Myron and the library staff cared for Dewey and accepted donations for his food and care. No public funds were used for his care.
A naming contest, "Name the Kitty", was held to choose his name. Dewey was the most popular choice, named after Melvil Dewey and his library coding system. The staff chose his middle and last name, Readmore Books. He usually went by Dewey, or sometimes, "Dew," "The Dew," "Do the Dew," or "Do the Dew: Code Red."
Dewey's breed is unknown. At first, Myron had thought he was part Persian. People came to believe that he might have been a Maine Coon cat or a Norwegian Forest Cat. Some others have argued he was a Tabby Cat, or a common mixed breed. 
During hard economic times in Iowa, Dewey comforted those in distress and cheered up both patrons and staff, both children and adults. Soon his lovable personality began to attract visitors and fan mail from all over the U. S. and the world. His fame grew worldwide as tourists discovered him living at the library; Dewey starred on Library Friends' fundraising postcards, cat-themed wall calendars, and in the 1997 documentary "Puss in Books: Adventures of the Library Cat", and resides posthumously on the library website. Dewey stories appeared in the local newspaper and subsequently in a variety of magazines such as "Cat Fancy", and "Country". He later appeared on Sioux City television and then across Iowa on public television in a documentary film. Word of Dewey continued to spread and eventually he was included in a television program in Japan. He was also featured in a few books and postcards. 
Dewey lived to be 19. During his last year he suffered from digestive complications and hyperthyroid disease. He was euthanized on November 29, 2006, after the veterinarian found a tumor in his stomach and discovered that Dewey was in constant pain. Obituaries appeared in more than 250 publications as well as on several television newscasts. Dewey was cremated (a local crematorium donated the services) and his ashes buried on the library grounds with a memorial stone donated by a local funeral home. 
Visitors from across the US and around the world continue to come to the Spencer library.
Personality.
Some of Dewey's favorite things were catnip (he was crazy around fresh catnip), rubber bands, Christmas trees, full-fat yogurt, his red wool, and boxes. As a kitten, he adored the library secretary Kim's typewriter. He also adored Vicki Myron's daughter, Jodi Marie.
Dewey was very finicky with his food. He only ate Fancy Feast, and he hated cat food with any sort of seafood in it. The staff tried beef, pork, chicken, liver, but none worked for very long. They kept an entire shelf of cat food just for Dewey.
Legacy.
Vicki Myron, who had been manager of the Spencer Public Library for 25 years, retired from her position after Dewey's death. Myron wrote a book, "", that was published in September 2008. By late 2008 it was on the "New York Times" bestseller list [http://www.hawes.com/no1_nf_d.htm (November 16, 2008). Her second book for adults, "Dewey's Nine Lives", was released in October 2010. Myron has also written three books about Dewey for children, including "Dewey's Christmas at the Library" (New York: Little, Brown, 2010: After finding a red ball of yarn, Dewey the cat, who lives in the Spencer, Iowa, public library, finds a way to help decorate the Christmas tree.). This was translated into French by Claudine Azoulay as "Dewey Fête Noël" (Toronto: Editions Scholastic, 2011).

Pershing State Park

Pershing State Park is a state park in the US state of Missouri consisting of located in Linn County. Located three miles west of Laclede, Missouri off U.S. Route 36, the park was named in honor of General of the Armies John J. Pershing, who led the United States forces in Europe in World War I. Pershing grew up in Laclede. 
History.
Long before John Pershing was born, or before any European immigrants reached the midwest, the land that encompasses Pershing State Park was the domain of Native Americans, mostly of the Sac and Fox tribes. The land in northern Missouri was used largely as hunting grounds for the tribes, but a few native settlements were established. Within the boundaries of Pershing State Park are two burial mounds and a former village site. The burial mounds are estimated to be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old.
Pershing State Park had its beginning in 1937 when the State of Missouri purchased a large tract of land, some 1,770 acres, a short distance west of Laclede for $20,000. Since the early 1930s a group from Laclede had petitioned the Federal government to create a national military memorial to Pershing in Linn county. However regulations prevented Congress from doing so for a person still living (Pershing did not die until 1948). A state park was seen as the next best alternative. Pershing's father had owned two farms in the vicinity, and Pershing himself had roamed the area in his youth, hunting and fishing along Locust creek.
Once purchased, the park was dedicated in 1940. The land however remained largely unused and undeveloped for several years save for two buildings constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps just prior to World War II. This lack of overdevelopment would later prove a plus as the meandering Locust Creek -- with its wet prairie, marshes, and bottomland forests -- reflects the natural wetland state of some northern Missouri lands before agricultural development and the channelization of large creeks and rivers.
The park today.
Pershing State Park now encompasses over 3,500 acres, much of it still undeveloped native habitat. There are five hiking trails within the park, including the 1.5 mile long boardwalk trail that winds through shrub swam, wet prairie, marshland and bottomland forest. The area along the trail is designated an Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society. There are three other trails all less than one half mile in length for easy hiking. The longest, the 6 mile long "Riparian Trail", links Pershing State Park to the Fountain Grove Conservation Area. 
Camping -- A 39-space campground provides both electrified and basic campsites along with modern amenities like showers, rv dump station, laundry, and water hookup. The .4 mile long Canfield Savanna Trail links the campground to other areas of the park. Primitive camping is also allowed along Riparian Trail.
Fishing & Boating -- There are four small lakes available stocked with bass, bluegill, and channel catfish. Locust Creek also offers the chance to catch bullhead, drum, and carp. Only canoes and boats using electric motors are allowed on the lakes. No launch ramp or marina services are present.
Picnicking -- A large enclosed shelter with kitchenette is available for rental. A covered shelter with water and electricity is free on a first come basis. Several other basic picnic sites are available. The two shelter sites each feature nearby playground equipment. 
War Angel Memorial -- Located in the primary day-use area, the marble monument honors all mothers who have lost their sons in war. It was dedicated in 1940 by the Missouri chapter of the American War Mothers organization. 
Other attractions -- Located within the park are a former water mill site, and a basement barn constructed in the 1890s. Across U.S. Route 36 from the main portion of the park is the Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site. Three miles to the east of the park in Laclede one can visit the Gen. John J. Pershing Boyhood Home State Historic Site. The Great Pershing Balloon Derby, which was originally held at the state park before moving to an event-specific donated area, is held near Pershing State Park each Labor Day weekend.

Junior Carlton Club

The Junior Carlton Club was a London gentlemen's club, now dissolved, which was established in 1866 and was disbanded in 1977.
History.
Anticipating the forthcoming Second Reform Act under Benjamin Disraeli, numerous prospective electors decided to form a club closely aligned to the Conservative party. Adopting the model of numerous other clubs of the day, i.e. the Junior Athenaeum, the Junior Oxford and Cambridge Club, etc., the club styled itself the Junior Carlton after the Carlton Club, which had a fixed number of members, and a lengthy waiting list, and so was therefore likely to remain out of the reach of these soon-to-be-enfranchised/newly enfranchised electors.
According to Anthony Lejeune, the Junior Carlton was the only one of the many clubs with the 'Junior' prefix to achieve anything of the prestige of the longer-standing, more established clubs which they sought to emulate.
Club building.
From 1869, the club was housed in sumptuous premises at 30 Pall Mall designed by David Brandon, which it occupied well into the twentieth century. The club building was built by Lucas Brothers.
Unfortunately, in the post-World War II era, it was to be the victim of an unfortunate planning decision by its ruling committee. The 'senior' Carlton Club building at 94 Pall Mall had suffered a direct hit during the Blitz, and the site had proved difficult to sell for redevelopment. In 1963, the Junior Carlton's committee decided to proceed with the sale of the existing Junior Carlton building, and use part of the proceeds to purchase the site of the old Carlton. They opted to construct a bold new building described at the time as " "the club of the future" ". The resulting concrete block, luridly decorated to 1960s architectural tastes, opened in 1968 and is still in use today as an office building. It proved so abhorrent to the membership that they fled in droves, mainly joining the Carlton.
By 1977, the club was wound down and its few remaining members formally merged with the Carlton.

RVNS Tran Nhat Duat (HQ-03)

RVNS "Tran Nhat Duat" (HQ-03) was a South Vietnamese frigate of the Republic of Vietnam Navy in commission from 1971 to 1975. She and her six sister ships were the largest South Vietnamese naval ships of their time.
History.
Construction and United States Navy service 1944–1946.
"Tran Nhat Duat" was built in the United States by Associated Shipbuilders, Inc. at Seattle, as the United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender . Commissioned in March 1944, " Yakutat" served in the Central Pacific during World War II and on occupation duty in Japan postwar. She was decommissioned in July 1946 and placed in reserve.
United States Coast Guard service 1948–1971.
The U.S. Navy loaned "Yakutat" to the United States Coast Guard in 1948,and she was commissioned as the "Casco"-class cutter USCGC "Yakutat" (WAVP-380) that year. Redesignated WHEC-380 and permanently transferred to the Coast Guard in 1966, "Yakutat" spent her long Coast Guard career on weather-reporting, law-enforcement, and search-and-rescue duties while on patrol in ocean stations in the North Atlantic. She also served two tours of duty (in 1967-1968 and in 1970) in the Vietnam War.
Republic of Vietnam Navy service 1971–1975.
Acquisition and operations.
After her antisubmarine warfare equipment had been removed, "Yakutat" was transferred to South Vietnam on 1 January 1971 and was commissioned into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS "Tran Nhat Duat" (HQ-03) By mid-1972, six other former "Casco"-class cutters had joined her in South Vietnamese service. They were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam's largest naval guns. "Tran Nhat Duat" and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore.
When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, "Tran Nhat Duat" became a ship without a country. She fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 May 1975 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected "Tran Nhat Duat" and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: "These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow."
Acquisition for spare parts by the Philippines.
The United States formally transferred "Tran Nhat Duat" to the Republic of the Philippines on 5 April 1976. She did not enter Philippine Navy service; instead she and her sister ship RVNS "Tran Quoc Toan" (HQ-06) were cannibalized for spare parts to allow the Philippines to keep four other sister ships in commission in the Philippine Navy.
The former "Tran Nhat Duat" was discarded in 1982 and probably scrapped.

Liz Stefanics

Elizabeth T. Stefanics (born November 9, 1950), known as Liz Stefanics, is an American politician from New Mexico, currently serving on the Santa Fe County Commission. A former member of the New Mexico Senate, she was the first openly LGBT member of the New Mexico legislature, serving a single four-year term that began in January 1993.
Early life and career.
Stefanics was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio but moved to New Mexico to teach at the University of New Mexico. The daughter of an airplane mechanic and a secretary, she grew up in poverty but went on to earn three college degrees. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from Eastern Kentucky University, before doing a masters in resource management at the University of Wisconsin and earning a doctorate in administration and law from the University of Minnesota. In addition, she has done post-doctoral work at the University of New Mexico in public administration and health care. She spent more than ten years as the executive director of Open Hands, a charity serving the elderly, disabled and poor, before which she was executive director of New Mexico AIDS Services.
In public office.
State Senate.
In 1992, Stefanics ran for the New Mexico Senate in the 39th district, a mostly rural district covering parts of six counties in northern New Mexico. She won the seat and took office in January 1993. During her four years in the senate, she co-chaired the Health and Human Services Interim Committee.
In her race for re-election in 1996, she faced a primary challenge from Phil Griego, a former member of Santa Fe City Council. She lost the primary election by a margin of 54 votes and Griego went on to win the seat.
In 1998, she ran for a seat on the newly created Public Regulation Commission from the 3rd district. In the primary election held on June 2, 1998 she faced fellow Democrat Jerome Block. The race was extremely close and Stefanics originally appeared to have won but final results, which included a number of originally uncounted ballots from Rio Arriba County, showed Block winning by approximately 0.2%. He went on to win the general election handily.
In 2000, she mounted a rematch against Griego, aiming to win back the seat she'd previously held in the state senate. She lost the primary by 53% to 47%.
Executive appointments.
Stefanics spent several years as the director of the New Mexico Health Policy Commission, a post to which she was appointed by Governor Bill Richardson. She had previously spent three years as deputy secretary of the state Human Services Department.
County Commission.
In 2008, Stefanics mounted a bid for the Santa Fe County Commission from the 5th district, which covers Eldorado and the Community College District south of the city. She won the Democratic primary election convincingly, garnering 52% of the vote in a five-way race. She was unopposed in the general election and took office on January 1, 2009. Stefanics was up for re-election in 2012 but drew no opponents in either the primary or general elections.
Personal life.
Stefanics is a lesbian and was the first openly gay person to serve in the New Mexico Legislature. She has spent almost two decades with her partner, Linda Siegle, a former chairman of the Santa Fe Community College Board of Trustees. Her campaigns have often won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund.
On 23 August, Stefanics and Siegle became the first same-sex couple in Santa Fe County to receive a marriage license as issued by the county clerk.

Heart First

Heart First is the second album by British singer Hazell Dean. It was her first album as a mainstream pop artist following the top ten successes of "Searchin' (I Gotta Find a Man)" and "Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go)". The album was released in 1984 and the first album to be produced by the Stock Aitken Waterman production team.
Background.
Released in late 1984, the album featured the top 10 hits "Searchin' (I Gotta Find a Man)" and "Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go)" as well as the singles "Back in My Arms (Once Again)" and "No Fool (For Love)", which both reached No.41. 
"Heart First" was released on the Proto record label and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman - the first album the trio were responsible for. The first single they produced for Dean was "Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go)", which was originally titled "Dance Your Love Away" and reworked by Waterman when Dean was unhappy with the chorus. The engineer of the song had accidentally mixed the drum beats backwards, which produced an unusual juddering sound across the recording, but Waterman was so impressed with the result that it stayed on the song. The single went on to sell 300,000 copies in the UK and was the producers' first top-10 hit together. 
Despite the hit, Stock Aitken Waterman were in dire financial straits, as was the record company, Proto. Waterman was keen to complete the album and considered it to be the very first full Hi-NRG album - a genre normally limited to singles and 12" remixes. The album was completed on a shoestring budget, but everyone involved was happy with the finished product. However, problems were apparent at the record company and despite the hit singles, the album failed to chart. Dean blamed the album's failure on poor promotion and bad timing. Dean parted company with Proto Records after the fourth single was released, but did go on to work with Stock Aitken Waterman again in future years. 
The album was released on Compact disc in 1984 in Japan in fact the CD was printed in Japan but was issued only in Germany, and elsewhere in 1997. It was later re-released on 15 March 2010 as a remastered special edition featuring bonus tracks through the UK label Cherry Red Records. This version included the song "Stay In My Life" (Dean's entry for the A Song for Europe competition in 1984), as well as B-sides and extended mixes not previously available on CD.

Keith Country Day School

Keith Country Day School is a private, fully accredited, independent, nonsectarian, college-preparatory school located in Rockford, Illinois, USA. It serves students from the preschool level (referred to as "cottage") to 12th grade.
History.
Keith Country Day School was founded in 1916 by Belle Emerson Keith.
Situated on a campus adjacent to Rockford's Sinnissippi Park and overlooking the Rock River, Keith School, as it is commonly referred to, is located at 1 Jacoby Place, on the site of the former Shoudy Mansion and carriage house. The Shoudy family owned three lots overlooking the Rock River along North Second Street between the Lysander Jacoby House to the north and the park and golf course to the south. Fred and Louise Shoudy, sold their home on the lot adjacent to the Jacoby House to Mrs. Keith around 1920. This property 
included a tennis court used by the school for many years.
Divisions of the School.
Keith School is divided into three separate schools:
The Lower School and The Upper School have separate Heads whom are responsible for reporting to the overall Head of School, formerly known as the Headmaster; this title was changed upon the appointment of Roberta Ingrassia, the second female Head after Belle Emerson Keith. The school also has a Board of Trustees, a twelve-member appointed board which serves as the governing body of the school. It is composed of the Head of School and past and present parents of Keith students, along with prominent civic figures.
Technological Advancements.
In 1998, Keith became the first school in Illinois to develop a comprehensive laptop computer program. This connected learning environment provides networked laptop computers for every sixth through 12th grade student and teacher, high-speed wireless access, individual email addresses for students and teachers, a Lower School computer lab and classroom computer centers, and a library with access to global electronic databases.

Keith School Parent Association (KPA).
All parents of Keith Country Day School students are members of the Parents’ Association, an organization which exists to promote friendly relationships among parents, to acquaint them with the spirit of Keith School, to obtain their cooperation with its objectives for the development of their children, and to initiate parents’ involvement in projects and functions which aid the school academically, socially and financially.
The Keith Parents’ Association (KPA) also serves the important function of communicating ideas, concerns and support to the administration and faculty of Keith School. The KPA meets once a month to discuss the Association’s fundraising activities as well as extra-
curricular events planned and coordinated by its officers and members. The KPA is also an important means of communication to the administration of the school. At each KPA meeting, the Head of School and other administrators submit reports regarding the health of the school. At these meetings it is possible for parents to ask appropriate questions of the administration regarding any aspect of school operations. The officers of the Association stay in consistent contact with the administration and with parents.
Monetary grants are made each year to teachers and school staff members by the KPA for numerous curricular and extra-curricular activities, and the KPA contributes significantly to the Sports, Music and Drama departments in both the Upper and Lower Schools.

The 1936 race between Osgood and Owens is one of the most told stories about Jesse Owens. Owens started badly and was in last place (trailing by 18 to 20 yards). Osgood was leading and reportedly said that when Owens passed him, "it sounded like a thunderstorm."
At the end of the 1936 track season, Osgood was selected as the captain for the 1937 team.
World record in the 120-yard high hurdles.
The 1937 Michigan track team led by Osgood won the Big Ten Conference championship. At the Big Ten championship held in May 1937 at Ferry Field in Ann Arbor, Osgood broke the world's record for the 120-yard high hurdles with a time of 14.0 seconds, one-tenth of a second under the previous world record set by 1936 Olympic gold medalist, Forrest Towns. The University of Michigan yearbook for 1937 noted that the race was run in the "driving rain, which soon turned the track into a miniature lake," requiring the athletes to splash their way "through the mud." "The New York Times" reported on Osgood's accomplishment as follows: "Captain Robert D. Osgood, a lanky senior from Lakewood, Ohio, scissored over the 120-yard high hurdles in the dazzling world-record time of 14 seconds today to embellish a smashing Michigan team triumph in the thirty-seventh annual Western Conference track and field championship meet."
Osgood's world record performance was cited at the end of 1937 as one of the highlights of the year's track season. One columnist described the performance as follows: "Driving through a sheet of rain that beat into his face with every stride, Bob Osgood shattered everything that had ever been done before in the 120-yard high hurdles in winning the Big Ten championship at Ann Arbor in 14 flat. This under miserable conditions on a wet and slow track." Another columnist noted that the "bespectacled young man" had set the record "in the rain and puddles of water," and asked, "What might Bob Osgood have done if the cinders had been dry and fast with no drizzle beating into his face?"
Osgood's world record was broken in April 1938 when Rice Institute's Fred Wolcott ran the 120-yard high hurdles with a downwind burst of 13.9 seconds.
Honors.
Osgood was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1983. And in 1992, he was also posthumously inducted into the Lakewood Athletic Hall of Fame.

Gunn Valley

Gunn Valley is a valley in the southern Chilcotin District of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada, just west of the Taseko Lakes and, like them, running on a north-south axis and at a perpendicular angle to Yohetta Valley, which drains to it via Yohetta Creek but also conncets through a low pass to Chilko Lake farther west. In Gunn Valley are Tuzcha and Fishem Lakes, which are fed and drained by Yohetta Creek, which joins the Tchaikazan River at the valley's southern end. Lastman Lake is at the valley's north end and is connected to the other lakes by a swampy pass, through which runs the access road to Yohetta Valley. There is an airstrip near the valley's southern end.
Name origin.
The valley's name is not derived from the Scots-Norwegian surname Gunn, but from the name of a member of the Xeni Gwet'in people of Nemaiah Valley, which is nearby to the north, whose name was "ganin" (meaning not provided).

Volta Tower

The tower was built in 1865 by William Mackworth-Dolben of Finedon Hall. 
William Harcourt Isham Mackworth (1806—1872), a younger son of Sir Digby Mackworth, the 3rd Baronet, took the additional surname Dolben after he married Frances, the heiress of Sir John English Dolben, the 4th Baronet.
History.
Mackworth-Dolben built the tower to commemorate the death of his eldest son, William Digby, who drowned at sea on 1 September 1863. Digby, a naval officer serving on the "Volta" drowned in the mouth of the River Niger. His younger brother, the poet Digby Mackworth Dolben drowned in 1867.
The tower was circular and about 100 feet high. A gabled extension of one of the two floors had been added in keeping. The tower stood far back with a long driveway in front, along Station Road in Finedon. Not much changed in the surroundings of the Volta Tower apart from Finedon's new cemetery was built alongside the Volta Tower in 1892.
The Collapse of the Volta Tower.
The Volta Tower collapsed on 16 November 1951 after standing for 86 years. At the time, Mrs Florence and her husband lived there. Mr was outside at the time of its collapse and survived but Mrs was inside and killed by the tower's collapse. It was discovered after its collapse that no mortar had been used at all in its construction which caused its untimely collapse. Older residents of the town who remember the day of the Volta Tower's collapse describe hearing a loud rumble as it collapsed and describe seeing a huge dust cloud in the air over where the Volta Tower had been standing.
Current times.
Today, the driveway up to where the Volta Tower stood still exists and a farm has been built on top of the Volta Tower's location as well as a bungalow. Nothing of the tower exists today apart from one carved stone figure of a cherub from close to the top of the tower which was auctioned and sold to one of Finedon's residents in 2005. 
It is only the older generation or those who have been told about the Volta Tower who know of its past existence but many of Finedon's residents will have never heard of it. It was one of Finedon's landmarks and does still appear on Finedon's town sign alongside the church and the windmill, which are both close to where the Volta Tower stood.

The Confessor (novel)

The Confessor is a 2003 spy fiction novel by Daniel Silva.
It is the third step on the Gabriel Allon series. 
Plot.
Gabriel Allon is tasked to investigate the murder of scholar Benjamin Stern in Munich. The lack of Stern's computer and other documents indicate that he was not killed for being a Jew — but rather for his current research. But Stern kept his research secret, so that Allon must solve a homicide with almost no clues.
Meanwhile, the death of Pope John Paul II has led to a conclave at the Vatican. The new pope, Pietro Lucchesi, who calls himself Paul VII, immediately angers powerful members of the Vatican by announcing his desire to speak at the synagogue of Rome. Opponents, such as Cardinal Marco Brindisi suspect that Paul VII intends to unearth candid and potentially damaging information about the role of the Catholic Church during the Holocaust.
Cardinal Brindisi is also the spiritual leader of a group called Crux Vera, a secret society established to defend the reputation and power of the Catholic Church at all costs. Roberto Pucci serves as the financial executive while Carlo Cassagrande, a former general within the Carabinieri, sees to security matters. The society enjoys considerable power within the Vatican. Because of their zealous commitment to the church, they vehemently oppose any policy that could darken the church’s reputation. Allon’s independent homicide investigation further complicates this dilemma, for the clues that he seeks will connect the Crux Vera to Stern's death. As a result, the brotherhood must eliminate everyone that might inform Allon of Stern's death and of the society’s existence.
The search for a motive for Stern's death leads Allon to the village of Brenzone on Lake Garda in northern Italy. There he learns that Stern had visited the local Convent of the Sacred Heart and contacts its superior, Mother Vincenza. She affirms that Stern had met with her to research places where Jews sought refuge during the Holocaust and she shows Allon a basement where Jews purportedly stayed. However, an unidentified caller warns Allon that Mother Vincenza is lying and that the truth can only be found through Sister Regina and another person by the name of Martin Luther. Upon Allon’s departure, Mother Vincenza secretly informs Crux Vera of Allon’s visit.
Stern’s murderer is a professional hitman from Switzerland named Eric ‘Leopard’ Lange, from whom Cassagrande commissions yet another murder. To Achille Bartoletti of the Italian police, Cassagrande paints Allon as a would-be papal assassin. Cassagrande thus gains control not only over the Vatican police but also over its Italian counterpart.
Allon meets with Rabbi Zolli in Venice and encounters his daughter Chiara Zolli for the first time. Zolli explains that to his knowledge no Jews were harboured in the Brenzone abbey. In fact, evidence seems to suggest the opposite: that the church expedited the removal of Jews and later helped Nazi leaders escape judgement. Allon then travels to Vienna to inform his colleague Eli Lavon of his findings. Eli reveals that the Martin Luther in question was the Nazi director of the German Foreign Office, which collaborated with European governments to track down and remove Jews. According to Eli, the Nazis especially wished to maintain positive relations with the Vatican, for any denunciation of the Holocaust by a pope would have certainly made the Nazis’ work more difficult. Allon and Eli conclude that there must be some connection between Nazi leader Martin Luther and the Convent of the Sacred Heart.
Upon discovering that Stern consulted with British journalist Peter Malone, Allon travels to London. Malone tells Allon that his recent book about Crux Vera had raised Stern's interest. Stern also hired Malone to track down two missing priests who were presumed dead and that the Roman police detective Alessio Rossi had been forced to close his files about their cases. Malone suggests that Crux Vera orchestrated Stern’s death to keep further details about the society’s identity and secrets from being published. Shortly after Allon leaves Malone, Eric Lange arrives and kills the journalist. As Lange leaves Malone’s flat, an Israeli surveillance technician gets a picture of the elusive Leopard, who soon consults with the professional terrorist Rashid Husseini, from whom he learns Allon’s true identity. Lange anticipates that Allon will seek out detective Alessio Rossi and hires Husseini to follow Rossi until Allon surfaces. Allon contacts Rossi in Rome, who surmises that the disappearance of the two missing priests points to a cover up within the Vatican. The arrival of a special police unit at Allon's hotel cuts short their discussion. Police shoot at the two fleeing men, killing Rossi and wounding Allon. Chiara Zolli rescues Allon and reveals that she also works for the Mossad and has been monitoring Allon throughout his investigation.
The investigation of Stern’s death now comes to the attention of Shimon Pazner, the Mossad's katsa in Rome, who sees no other option but to deport him to Israel. However, Zolli feels that Allon must not abandon the investigation. They board Allon’s deportation boat, navigate to the Provence to meet with Antonia Huber, the daughter of Sister Regina Carcassi. The former delivers an account of a clandestine meeting between Nazi agents and members of the Vatican on the premises of the Brenzone abbey. In this meeting, members of the Curia assured the cooperation of the Vatican with Martin Luther’s removal of the Jews. Sister Regina, who witnessed the meeting, did not share her knowledge with anyone, but instead, wrote the account. Huber confides to Allon that she also gave a copy of the letter to Stern. The letter proves that the missing priests were present at the meeting, and Huber adds that her mother was later murdered.
Allon feels certain that the series of disappearances and murders relates to the pact between Nazi and Curia elements. Back in Munich, Allon finds a Nazi document that links the Holy See to Martin Luther’s removal of the Jews. Both return to Vienna to meet with Eli and Shamron, Allon's superior at the Mossad. Shamron notifies Allon of the pope’s intention to speak at the synagogue of Rome and surmises that the pope’s mission and life is in danger from the same people that killed Stern. He urges Allon to personally share the documents with the pope and to safeguard the pope. Meanwhile Crux Vera has again hired hitman Eric Lange, this time with the purpose of killing the pope at the synagogue.
Through his contacts in the art restoration community, Allon secures a private audience with Pope Paul VII. The pope attests to the verity of the documents and cites his own personal testimony, for he himself, like Sister Regina, had overheard the terrible meeting at the Convent of the Sacred Heart while living as an orphan in the abbey. The pope’s determination to speak at the synagogue stems from his conviction that the Catholic Church has many offenses to confess to the Jews. Paul VII ignores Allon’s admonition to cancel the appointment at the synagogue and instead suggests that Allon personally accompany him within the pope’s security team.
Surprisingly, the pope’s speech at the synagogue proves uneventful. But at the very same time Cassagrande secretly renounces his role in the pope’s assassination and instead hires Lange to kill its instigator, Marco Brindisi. Cassagrande then commits suicide. Allon arrives a few seconds late at the crime scene but manages to pursue Lange on a motorbike. But in the narrow alleys of Trastevere Lange manages to escape, while Allon crashes on the street's pavement and tumbles hard. His wounds are critical and Paul VII himself provides him with the attention of the pope’s personal medical staff. When Allon recovers, it is clear that he and Chiara have developed romantic feelings for each other.
Meanwhile, details of Brindisi and Cassagrande’s plot are leaked to the press. The story links Pucci to Crux Vera and eventually destroys his financial empire. Although the pope chooses to protect the church by denying the newspaper’s findings, he seizes the opportunity to rid the Curia of members of the Crux Vera. Shamron returns to Tel Aviv and creates Team Leopard, a task force devoted to identifying and killing Eric Lange. The story ends months later when Allon personally locates and kills Lange.

Trichorrhexis invaginata

Trichorrhexis invaginata (also known as "Bamboo hair" ) is a distinctive hair shaft abnormality that may occur sporadically, either in normal hair or with other hair shaft abnormalities, or regularly as a marker for Netherton's syndrome. The primary defect appears to be abnormal keratinization of the hair shaft in the keratogenous zone, allowing for intussusception of the fully keratinized and hard distal shaft into the incompletely keratinized and soft proximal portion of the shaft.
History.
In 1937, Touraine and Solente first noted the association between hair-shaft defects (bamboo node) and ichthyosiform erythroderma. Còme first coined the term ichthyosis linearis circumflexa in 1949, although Rille had previously recorded the distinctive features of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa by 1922. In 1958, Netherton described a young girl with generalized scaly dermatitis and fragile nodular hair-shaft deformities, which he termed trichorrhexis nodosa. Later, this was more appropriately renamed as trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) for a ball-and-socket–type hair-shaft deformity at the suggestion of Wilkinson et al. 
In 1974, Mevorah et al established the clinical relationship between ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and Netherton syndrome, and an atopic diathesis was found to occur in approximately 75% of patients with Netherton syndrome.
Background.
"Bamboo hair" is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, trichorrhexis invaginata, and atopic diathesis with failure to thrive. Chronic skin inflammation results in scaling and exfoliation, predisposing these patients to life-threatening infections, sepsis, and dehydration. The Netherton syndrome Mendelian Inheritance in Man is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations of both copies of the "SPINK5" gene (localized to band 5q31-32), which encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI (lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor). LEKTI is expressed in epithelial and mucosal surfaces and in the thymus. Each "SPINK5" mutation leads to a different length of LEKTI protein, resulting in genotype/phenotype correlations in cutaneous severity, susceptibility to atopic dermatitis, growth retardation, skin infection, increased stratum corneum protease activities,and elevated kallikrein levels in the stratum corneum.
Trichorrhexis invaginata, or bamboo hair, is a hair shaft abnormality that occurs as a result of an intermittent keratinizing defect of the hair cortex. Incomplete conversion of the sulfhydryl –SH group onto S-S disulfide bonds in the protein of the cortical fibers leads to cortical softness and subsequent invagination of the fully keratinized distal hair shaft into the softer, abnormally keratinized proximal hair shaft. Intussusception of the distal hair shaft into the proximal hair shaft results in a distinctive ball-and-socket hair shaft deformity. The affected hairs are brittle and breakage is common, resulting in short hairs.
Migratory lesions of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa may be caused by a dermal influx of inflammatory cells that undergo phagocytosis and digestion by keratinocytes, resulting in disruption of keratinization.
Increased transepidermal water loss resulting from the disturbance of corneocyte barrier function in erythroderma may cause profound metabolic abnormalities and hypernatremia, particularly in neonates.
Approximately 200 cases of trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) have been reported in the literature, but the true incidence is not known. The incidence of trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) may be as high as 1 case in 50,000 population. 
Girls are affected more often by trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) than boys, but is present in all races.

John Hampson (novelist)

John Frederick Norman Hampson Simpson (26 March 1901 – 26 December 1955), who wrote as John Hampson, was an English novelist.
Best known for his 1931 novel "Saturday Night at the Greyhound" - an unexpected critical and commercial success for the Hogarth Press - he was a member of the Birmingham Group of working class authors which included Walter Allen, Leslie Halward and Peter Chamberlain.
Life.
Hampson was born in Handsworth in Birmingham, the fifth of eight children of a prosperous and prominent family who had made their money in brewing and the theatre. The collapse of the family business in 1907 left them in financial difficulties, however, and they moved to Leicester where Hampson's parents found work in a variety of less prestigious occupations. Unable to complete his formal education due to ill health, Hampson worked in a munitions factory during World War I and spent the following years working in a variety of jobs in Nottingham and Derbyshire, including working as a waiter, a chef and a billiard-marker, and running a pub with his sister. A conviction for shoplifting books saw him serve a prison term in Wormwood Scrubs.
In 1925 he was offered employment by a wealthy family in Dorridge, Solihull to act as a residential nurse and companion for their son Ronald, who had Down syndrome. The security this provided enabled him to start writing, and he made a number of literary friends including Forrest Reid, J. R. Ackerley, William Plomer, John Lehmann, and E. M. Forster.
On Plomer's advice Hampson sent three manuscripts to Leonard and Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Press. Despite considering the longer "O Providence" "much the better book", they selected "Saturday Night at the Greyhound" as most suitable as a first publication. The third manuscript "Go Seek a Stranger", the first novel Hampson had written, was to remain unpublished due to its explicit homosexual subject-matter, though Virginia Woolf later remarked "I still think his first purely sodomitic novel the best".
Although they considered Hampson a good writer the Woolfs had been pessimistic about his commercial potential, but "Saturday Night at the Greyhound" was to prove a success both critically and in terms of sales - quickly selling out its first print run and being reprinted twice in its first six months. Its later paperback edition by Penguin Books sold 80,000 copies, and it was republished again in 1950 and 1986. His short stories were published in prestigious literary magazines throughout the 1930s but his second published novel "O Providence" sold less well than his first, and his next - "Foreign English", based on his 1931 trip to Berlin - was rejected by the Hogarth Press, whom he subsequently left for Heinemann. He was to publish five more novels, but none matched the success of his first.
In 1933, through the American critic Edward J. O'Brien, Hampson met Walter Allen and the other writers who came to be known as the Birmingham Group including Leslie Halward, Peter Chamberlain and Walter Brierley, whose novel "Means Test Man" Hampson provided assistance with. He became a committed anti-Nazi following a visit to Berlin in 1933, and in 1936, at the suggestion of W. H. Auden, he married the German actress Therese Giehse so that she could obtain a British passport and escape from Nazi Germany.
He worked for the BBC during World War II and visited India in 1948, but the death of his employer in 1955 saw him leave the house in Dorridge, and he died of a heart attack on 26 December. 
Hampson was noted for his peculiar appearance - being of tiny physical size and deliberately dressing entirely in brown.

Novy Uoyan

Novy Uoyan () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Severo-Baykalsky District of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia, located in the basin of the Upper Angara River, from Ulan-Ude and from Nizhneangarsk. Population: 
History.
It was founded in the mid-1970s in conjunction with the construction of the Baikal Amur Mainline, near the village of Uoyan on the left bank of the Upper Angara. The railway station and settlement were constructed by workers from the then Lithuanian SSR, as sections of the track were given patronage of Komsomol brigades from various parts of the Soviet Union. Urban-type settlement status was granted to it in 1976.
Regular traffic on the railway section between Severobaikalsk and Novaya Chara in northern Zabaykalsky Krai began in 1989. Completion of the BAM did not bring the expected economic development of the town and surrounding region, and with the economic crisis in the late 1980s, the town's population dropped from 9,547 in 1989 to 4,957 in 2002.
Economy and transportation.
Novy Uoyan is an important station on the Baikal-Amur Mainline, which presents the only real economic activity in the town. The BAM crosses the Upper Angara close to the town via a long bridge.
There are proposals to build a long connection between the BAM and the Trans-Siberian Railway through Buryatia, with a northern teminus at Novy Uoyan, beginning either at Novoilyinsky, or from Mogzon in Zabaykalsky Krai. This section would be mainly intended to service mining developments, such as the lead and zinc mine "Ozyorninskoye", which could be reached from the south by 2012.

Sappington Cemetery State Historic Site

Sappington Cemetery State Historic Site in Saline County, Missouri, is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site.
Not far from historic Arrow Rock, Missouri, the cemetery holds the gravesite of Dr. John Sappington (1776–1856), a prominent early physician and businessman in Missouri. Dr. Sappington was a proponent of using quinine in the treatment of malaria, and at the time was the largest importer of the drug in America. Dr. Sappington is also responsible for writing the first medical book published west of the Mississippi River.
Sappington and his family were heavily involved in antebellum Missouri Democratic politics. Two son-in-laws, Meredith Miles Marmaduke and Claiborne Fox Jackson, would become Governors of Missouri. Grandson John Sappington Marmaduke was a noted Confederate General in the American Civil War as well as a Missouri Governor in later years. After a long illness, Dr. Sappington died on September 7, 1856. In addition to Dr. Sappington, the cemetery holds the graves of several of his children and Governors Fox and Meredith Marmaduke.
Established by Dr. Sappington himself in 1831, the two-acre cemetery holds 111 headstones and grave markers. Sappington Cemetery became a part of the Missouri State Park system in 1967 by act of the Missouri General Assembly. The site has not been modified for ADA accessibility in order to preserve its historic nature and appearance. No restrooms or other facilities are provided.

Thor Cogeneration Power Station

Thor Cogeneration is a planned gas-fired cogeneration plant, which is to be built on Seal Sands near Billingham, in County Durham, North East England.
Development.
On 19 January 2007, newly established business venture Thor Cogeneration, a subsidiary of Teesside based PX Group, announced plans for a new power station on Teesside. The station is proposed as a 1,020 megawatt (MW) combined heat and power combined cycle gas turbine plant. Stockton Borough Council gave their approval for the station in April 2007. The station's license for the generation of electricity was also granted later in 2007. On 28 August 2008, government approval for the station to be built was granted by Energy minister Malcolm Wicks. Construction is expected to begin in 2009, with operations predicted for early in 2012.
Proposed specification.
The station will use two gas-fired generators, with excess heat being used to make steam to drive a further generator. Electricity generated will be distributed to the National Grid. As well as generating electricity, the station will provide heat to the nearby, SABIC operated North Tees Works oil refinery, in the form of steam. Natural gas, the station's fuel, will be supplied to the station by a pipeline, with a short connection to an existing pipeline to the north. The station will require 20% less gas per MW generated than current operating gas-fired stations.
The station is expected to be able to achieve a 58% efficiency rating by using the latest gas turbine technology. It will create 60% less carbon emissions than current coal-fired power stations. It will be cooled by using an air cooled condenser, avoiding the need to extract from or discharge water into the nearby River Tees. 1,000 people will be employed during the construction and 60 will be employed when the station is operational.

James Oneal

James J. "Jim" Oneal (1875–1962), a founding member of the Socialist Party of America (SPA), was a prominent socialist journalist, historian, and party activist who played a decisive role in the bitter party splits of 1919-21 and 1934-36.
Biography.
Early years.
James J. Oneal was born March 13, 1875 in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of an iron worker. Upon the death of his father, Oneal was forced to leave school to go to work in a steel mill to help support his family. Oneal only attended public school through the 6th grade, relying instead upon self-education. 
Oneal was an early convert to social democratic politics, joining the Socialist Labor Party of America in 1895 before leaving to join the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) of Victor L. Berger and Eugene V. Debs shortly after its founding in 1897. Long a resident of Terre Haute, Indiana, Oneal was a close personal friend of his neighbor Debs.
Oneal was a delegate to the 1900 convention of the SDP and to the 1901 Unity Convention at which the Socialist Party of America (SPA) was born. He was also elected as the first State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Indiana, state affiliate of the SPA, shortly after establishment of the new party. The following year Oneal was elected to the governing National Committee of the SPA as the representative of the Socialist Party of Indiana.
In 1903, Oneal moved to Omaha and went to work in the party's National Office as an assistant to Executive Secretary William Mailly. He continued in that role until 1905, at which time he left to become the Associate Editor of the New York "Worker," forerunner of the great Socialist daily, the "New York Call". After leaving the Worker in 1908, Oneal returned home to Indiana, where he was elected the State Secretary of the SP of Indiana from 1911 to 1913. By 1915, Oneal had relocated again, this time to Massachusetts, where he was elected State Secretary of that party in 1915, continuing in that post until 1917.
Oneal attended virtually every convention of the SPA as a delegate, including the seminal Emergency National Conventions of 1917, as a delegate from Massachusetts, and 1919, as a delegate from New York. Oneal also ran for office on the Socialist ticket, standing for President of the Brooklyn Board of Aldermen in 1919.
Oneal's main occupation in these years was that of Socialist journalist. From 1918 until the end of the publication in 1923, Oneal was the editorial writer for the SPA daily, the "New York Call." In that role he was extremely influential during the factional party turmoil which erupted in 1919, a power made even more forceful when combined with the voice and vote which Oneal held on the party's governing 15 member National Executive Committee, to which he was elected in 1918. After the demise of the daily "Call", Oneal was instrumental in starting its weekly successor, "The New Leader," and he served as editor of that long-running publication from its establishment in 1924.
Oneal in the 1919 Left Wing controversy.
The inner-party political situation during the war years has long been caricatured as a struggle between an ultra-revolutionary Left Wing and a "conservative" Right Wing. In actuality, the political views within the party's so-called Right Wing were more akin to a rainbow than a dichotomy. Perspectives among Party Regulars ranged from Christian socialism and tepid Sewer Socialism on the one hand to staunch support for the anti-militarism of the 1917 St. Louis program and an earnest desire to initiate socialist society via the ballot box. James Oneal's own orientation in these years was closer to the latter pole, along with other main political leaders of the party, such as Eugene V. Debs, Morris Hillquit, Adolph Germer, and John M. Work. The true "Right Wing" of the party (exemplified by a large section of the publicists associate with the party, including Allan L. Benson, Charles Edward Russell, John Spargo, Emanuel Haldeman-Julius, and Carl D. Thompson peeled away in 1917-18, as American participation in the European conflict became a reality and Woodrow Wilson's argument that this was indeed a "war to make the world safe for democracy" made converts.
As the war drew to a close, accentuated with a Bolshevik victory in Russia in November 1917, the revolutionary socialist Left Wing began to organize with a view to transforming the Socialist Party of America into a form better able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat and a soviet form of government, but by September 1919 they had been expelled and became the Communist Labor Party of America under the direction of Alfred Wagenknecht and L.E. Katterfeld and the Communist Party of America headed by C. E. Ruthenberg.
Oneal in the 1934-36 Old Guard controversy.
In 1934, Oneal played a role as a prominent member of the so-called "Old Guard" faction, which opposed the new Declaration of Principles passed by the party's Detroit Convention of 1934. Oneal used his positions as editor of "The New Leader" and official at the Rand School of Social Science effectively in bolstering the Old Guard's Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, working with Chairman of the Socialist Party of New York Louis Waldman to lock up these party assets in the hands of his faction. 
Oneal raised funds to publish a polemical pamphlet, issued under his own name in 1934, which took aim at his factional opponents. Oneal mocked the Thomasites as "'militant' liberals" capable only of winning the temporary allegiance of shallow college students, dismissed the Militant faction as "pseudo-Marxists and phrasemongers," and alleged that the Revolutionary Policy Committee (U.S.) were nothing more or less than practitioners of "Lovestone Communism" and were acting as a "dual organization in the party." He furthermore lambasted the League for Industrial Democracy, a bastion of the Thomas faction, as "a parasite on the Socialist Party and a dangerous dual organization" and specified instances in which the Thomas-dominated National Executive Committee of the SP had violated the party constitution. 
Oneal's pamphlet included a coupon which readers could tear out, fill in, and mail to him, pledging the allegiance of the sender "as one with you for constructive party work and progress." The coupons accumulated doubtlessly proved invaluable as the Old Guard faction left the SP to establish itself as the Social Democratic Federation of America.
The Old Guard-dominated Socialist Party of New York was expelled en bloc by the National Executive Committee of the SPA in 1936 and Oneal and "The New Leader" followed. The New York organization originally reconstituted itself as the "People's Party," before becoming the New York state section of the Social Democratic Federation of America at a state convention held at the end of March 1937. A national convention to formally establish the SDF was scheduled for the end of May 1937, with Oneal named "Acting National Secretary" in the run up to this foundation meeting.
The parting of ways with "The New Leader".
The relationship between the "New Leader" staff and the SDF political leadership was never completely cordial owing to differing opinions as to editorial policy. While Editor Oneal was a strong SDF partisan but he clashed personally and philosophically with the publication's business manager, Sol Levitas, a former Menshevik vice mayor of Vladivostok. In December 1937, Levitas persuaded the paper's board of directors to change his title to "Executive Editor," a move which prompted a letter of resignation from the pugnacious Oneal. An uneasy truce continued between the two men, with Oneal working only 3 days a week owing to a slight stroke which he had suffered.
Finally, in the spring of 1940, the differing orientations of Oneal and Levitas came to a head. Oneal charged that the "secrecy, deception and direct sabotage" of Levitas were undermining his editorial authority. Levitas sought to water down the social democratic element of a publication to such an extent that "the reader will have to use very powerful glasses to find it." In April 1940, Oneal quit the publication for good, declaring that the paper had become a tepid liberal publication instead of a social democratic organ which worked to bolster the SDF organization.
Death and Legacy.
James Oneal died on December 12, 1962 in Seattle, Washington.

Lebaudy Patrie

The Lebaudy "Patrie" was a semi-rigid airship built for the French army in Moisson, France, by sugar producers Lebaudy Frères. Designed by Henri Julliot, Lebaudy's chief engineer, the "Patrie" was completed in November 1906 and handed over to the military the following month. The "Patrie" bears the distinction of being the first airship ordered for military service by the French army.
In 1907, from her base at Chalais-Meudon near Paris, a successful series of military manoeuvres was conducted with the airship by the military command, which included a visit by France's President of the Council Georges Clemenceau. Following the successful completion of these operations, in November 1907 the "Patrie" was transferred under her own power to her operational base at Verdun, near the German border.
Due to a mechanical fault, the "Patrie" became stranded away from her base on 29 November 1907 in Souhesmes. During a storm on 30 November she was torn loose from her temporary moorings and, despite the efforts of some 200 soldiers who tried to restrain her, she was carried away by the high winds and lost from sight. Had the rope to the emergency gas-release system been attached, her loss could possibly have been avoided. After crossing the English Channel and passing unseen through English airspace during the night, the "Patrie" was sighted over Wales and Ireland on 1 December. She made a brief landfall near Belfast, before rising again to be blown out over the Atlantic Ocean. Following a sighting from a steamship off the Hebrides, she was lost without a trace.
Despite the loss of the "Patrie", Lebaudy went on to complete a sister-ship to the "Patrie", the "République", for the French Army. Additionally, several airships of a similar design to the "Patrie" were ordered and delivered to export customers, these included the Russian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Development.
The military uses of airships at the time were considered to be the dropping of bombs (from an altitude at which they were deemed to be out of range of ground-based weapons) and reconnaissance. M. Julliot, the designer of the "Patrie", stated that "each of the French ships can carry thirty, and on short journeys, even fifty torpedoes of 10 kilogrammes (22 lb) each." For reconnaissance purposes the "Patrie" was equipped with "a mounting for a telephotographic apparatus, and for a 100-candlepower acetylene searchlight". A contemporary author related that "from a height of the "Patrie" observed the smallest movements of formed bodies of troops at the Satory camp and obtained very clear telephotographs of them."
Semi-rigid airships were considered more suitable for military use because, unlike rigid airships, they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. The "Patrie" was a semi-rigid airship manufactured by the French sugar magnates Paul and Pierre Lebaudy and designed by their chief engineer, Henri Julliot. She was the second Lebaudy airship, and "surpassed her predecessor in both size and method of construction". The company's first airship, simply known as the "Lebaudy", and dubbed by the French public ""Le Jaune"" ("The Yellow (One)") because of the yellow colour of the lead chromate paint on its cloth exterior, was considered the most successful airship then in operation.
Design.
Overview.
The main structural components of the "Patrie", like those of its predecessor, were the envelope (or "gas-bag"), a nickel-steel frame or keel, and a gondola suspended from the frame on steel cables. Contained within the envelope was a ballonet, the function of which was to ensure that sufficient gas pressure was maintained in the envelope at all times, irrespective of the degree of expansion or contraction of the lifting gas. Attached to both the gas-bag and the gondola were active and passive control surfaces to provide lateral and vertical stability and to give the pilot directional control over the airship.
The gondola, constructed of nickel-steel tubing, was suspended some below an elliptical steel frame (or keel) attached to the bottom of the gas-bag, under the centre of lift. Between the frame and the envelope and linking the two was a small hemp net. The net was attached by wooden toggles to a canvas band sewn directly onto the envelope, and the frame was attached to the net by further toggles. This permitted the easy removal of the frame from the envelope. The frame itself could also be dismantled for ease of transport.
The open gondola offered the crew and passengers little protection from the elements. It was common for there to have been two pilots, two engineers and two passengers on board during test flights and military missions. Ballast, in the form of 10- and 20-pound (4.5 and 9.1 kg) bags of sand, could be jettisoned through a pipe set into the floor of the gondola. Other equipment included "a 'siren' speaking trumpet, carrier pigeons, iron pins, ropes for anchoring the airship, a reserve supply of fuel and water, and a fire extinguisher".
Envelope and ballonet.
The "Patrie"'s envelope was composed of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the "Jaune", comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.
The lead chromate gave the envelope the same mustard-yellow colour as its precessor, "Le Jaune"; the remaining surfaces were coloured sky-blue, as is evident in a contemporary artist's impression of the "Patrie".
The "Patrie"'s design as a semi-rigid airship required that the pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and the air in the ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.
To control the movement of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the "Patrie" was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500 Pa, 0.723 psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78 inAq (195 Pa, 0.282 psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see "Final flight" section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained in the event of an engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.
A release mechanism was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a pull on the attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, so that it would also be activated automatically in the case of a catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the "Patrie".
Since a partially filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, due to the mass of air rolling fore or aft in the direction of pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.
Steering and propulsion.
Directional stability was achieved by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached at the rear of the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.
During trials it was decided that a greater degree of control over vertical motion was required, which would also allow the pilot to compensate for "involuntary rising or falling of the airship due to expansion or contraction of the gas, or to other causes". For this purpose a movable horizontal plane was installed above the car and near the centre of gravity, which resulted in the loss of gas and ballast being reduced to a minimum.
At a later date this single plane was replaced by two movable planes mounted either side of and above the gondola, attached to the bottom of the elliptical frame, as shown in the plan view published in the German "Jahrbuch der Luftfahrt" ("Aviation Yearbook") in 1911. These "ailerons d'ascension et de descente" as they were referred to at the time, are clearly visible in the still photograph taken from the short film "Decollage d'un ballon dirigeable" ("The Take-off of a Dirigible Balloon"), made in Moisson by the pioneering French film-maker Alice Guy-Blaché before her emigration to the United States in March 1907.
The pilot operated the controls at the bows of the gondola, forward of the engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70 hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000 rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5 ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200 rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below the rear of the gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280 L (61.6 gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.
Operational history.
November – December 1906.
The first flight of the "Patrie" took place on 16 November 1906, at Lebaudy's Moisson headquarters, lasting 2 hours and 20 mins. After eight further test flights from Moisson, the "Patrie" flew the from Moisson to the French Aeronautical Department's centre at Chalais-Meudon near Paris on 15 December 1906 at an estimated speed in excess of 45 km/h (28.1 mph). A public relations flight over the centre of Paris was undertaken on 17 December 1906, passing over the Arc de Triomphe, the Place de la Concorde, the War Ministry buildings and Les Invalides. Following this flight, "Patrie" was deflated until flights resumed in June 1907.
June – November 1907.
During the summer of 1907, 21 further flights were undertaken between 27 June and 7 August, including one on 22 July 1907 in which the President of the Council (Prime Minister) Georges Clemenceau, and the Minister of War Georges Picquart were passengers. Although a pipe became detached, showering the Premier with hot water, he reacted nonchalantly, saying "I cannot sufficiently express my admiration for this wonderful contrivance".
The "Patrie" was then deflated for alterations that included the addition of a 500 cubic metre (17,660 ft³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag, a change to the empennage (as mentioned above) and provision of new propellers.
The "Patrie" was reinflated and made ready for operational duty on 15 October 1907. Nine flights, totalling 18 hours, were undertaken from Chalais-Meudon between 21 October and 16 November, during one of which the left propeller was lost, causing the "Patrie" to ascend rapidly into the low clouds before returning safely but slowly to Chalais-Meudon under her own power. On 23 November 1907, the "Patrie" was flown to her operational base at Belleville-sur-Meuse near Verdun, close to the Franco-German border, a journey of 240 km (149 mi) in 6 hours 45 minutes, at an average speed of 36 km/h (22 mph) and a height of .
Final flight.
While based at Verdun, the "Patrie" was stranded on Friday, 29 November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes due to a mechanical problem caused by the clothing of one of the mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.
During that night, a storm blew up and approximately 200 soldiers were assigned to the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the "Patrie" could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.
Relieved of her ballast of and without a crew, she shot up to a great height (calculated by the constructor to have been some ), and was carried away in a north-westerly direction. Two days later there was still no news. In 2007, the French newspaper "Journal l'Alsace / Le Pays" reprinted a news item from 5 December 1907, which spoke of the "anxiety" caused in Paris by this "disaster". It was feared that the "Patrie" could have risen into an eastward air current, crossed the nearby Franco-German border and fallen into "Prussian" hands, so news reports of her whereabouts were eagerly awaited.
Finally news of sightings filtered back to France and spread around Europe and the United States. As was reported in "The New York Times" the following day, the "Patrie" had been observed on the morning of Sunday, 1 December 1907, over Cardigan (Wales). On the afternoon of the same day she made landfall at Ballysallagh, near Holywood, County Down in northern Ireland, where a propeller and bevel gear assembly were broken off (see photo). With the loss of this weight the "Patrie" once more ascended and was spotted by a Lloyd's signal station at Torr Head on the Antrim coast. The next sighting came soon after, over islands in St. Patrick's Channel, between Ireland and Scotland. The "Patrie" continued northwards, where the last sighting was reported by Captain Buchanan of the steamship "Olivine" at latitude 58°N near the Hebrides, after which she was lost without a trace.
Aftermath.
Despite the loss of the "Patrie", the French army did not lose faith in the Lebaudy/Julliot design: A sister-ship to the "Patrie", the "République", was already under construction at Lebaudy's Moisson works, and another airship of the same type ("La Liberté") was ordered in August 1908. In addition, two more airships of essentially the same design were ordered by the Russian Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The former, initially called "La Russie" and later known as "Lebed", reportedly "an absolute copy of the French 'République'", flew for the first time in 29 May 1909. The inaugural flight of "Lebed" was hailed by Russia as a significant step forward in its aviation history. In its June 26, 1909 issue, "Flight" Magazine reported that the Austrian Government had ordered from Lebaudy "what appears to be a duplicate of the "Russie". This airship entered service with the Austrian Army in 1910.

Stockton State Park

Stockton State Park is a state park in the US state of Missouri consisting of located in Cedar County.
Sailing and Serenity.
The clear blue waters of Stockton Lake make Stockton State Park an ideal destination for water recreation. Located on a peninsula that juts northward between the Big and Little Sac arms of the lake, the park offers easy access to the lake and its many recreational opportunities.
Sailing on Stockton Lake.The area around what is now Stockton State Park has a long and rich history. Archaeological evidence found in the area indicates that man occupied the Sac River valley as long ago as 10,000 years. Burial mounds, village sites and campsites from several different cultures of prehistoric man have been discovered. A group known as the Dalton man, primarily hunters and gatherers, were the first people to inhabit the area. As the climate and vegetation changed, so did the inhabitants.
When the French first explored the region in the 17th century, the Osage Indians controlled much of the area. In the last part of the 18th century, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians began to filter into the Osage Indian land from the southeast due to pressure from European settlers. In 1808, the United States acquired the land with the signing of a treaty between the Osage Indian chief and representatives of the government.
The first permanent settlements in the area were established in the 1830s. Stockton became the county seat of Cedar County in 1846. The town was first named Lancaster, later changed to Fremont and then to Stockton in 1859 in honor of a Mexican War commander, I.F. Stockton. Stockton has earned the distinction as the Black Walnut Capital of the World and celebrates by hosting the Black Walnut Festival each year in September.
Located on the gently rolling Springfield plateau, the Stockton area is surrounded by rugged Ozark hills to the east and tallgrass prairie to the west. Characteristics of both landscapes still can be found in the Stockton area. Although much of the area has been cleared for farming, the land still supports remnants of oak-hickory forests with an understory of red cedar, honey locust, dogwood and redbud.
The Stockton Lake was created when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a dam across the Sac River near Stockton in 1970. Since that time, the lake has become a favorite spot for fishing, swimming, skiing, scuba diving and especially sailing. The open topography of the area allows a dependable southwest breeze perfect for sailing.
Stockton State Park offers easy access to the lake and everything needed for a day on the water. Fishing boats, pontoon boats, personal watercrafts and sailboats can be rented at the park's marina, which also can supply gas, fishing tackle, groceries and camping supplies. The park has two boat ramps and 320 boat stalls, including more than 70 designed just for sailboats.
Fishermen casting their lines can anticipate catching bass, crappie, walleye, catfish or bluegill. A quiet cove or secluded shoreline is not hard to find. The clear waters of Stockton Lake make it a popular place to scuba dive. Visitors can also cool off in the water or lounge on the park's swimming beach, complete with a change house.

Veng Abbey

Veng Abbey was one of Denmark's earliest Benedictine monasteries and was located in the village of Veng near Skanderborg, Region of Southern Denmark. The former abbey church, still in use as a parish church, is the oldest remaining in the country.
History.
Veng Abbey was established as a Benedictine monastery some time in the late 1060s, with connections to the royal forebears of King Valdemar I. By the 1160s the abbey had fallen into a severe decline: the original endowments failed to sustain it, and it had gained a reputation for being "unruly". Eventually Abbot Jens was brought before a church tribunal and forced to give up his office on the grounds of immorality and theft of the harvest. Three recalcitrant monks were all that remained at Veng, and Svend, Bishop of Aarhus, received permission from Pope Alexander III to close the abbey.
Just a year later Bishop Svend granted occupation of the empty premises to the Cistercian monks from Sminge Abbey, originally from Vitskøl Abbey, who were dissatisfied with the infertility of the soil at Sminge. They settled at Veng Abbey in 1166. It looked like a very good location for the Cistercians, but they had not reckoned with Lady Margrethe.
Lady Margrethe was the widow of a local nobleman. She had petitioned Bishop Svend to convert Veng Abbey into a nunnery with herself as the abbess, a position which would bring with it a guaranteed annual income. When the Cistercians were confirmed at Veng, she did everything she could to make life miserable for them. She had her servants occupy the rent-producing farms that had belonged to Veng, and was accused of ordering one of her servants to steal the vestments from the church so that mass could not be said. Without income, the Cistercians had no choice but to leave, and in 1168 moved to another site on the small isle of Kalvø in Skanderborg Lake. 
On Kalvø, as previously at Sminge, the soil proved useless for farming and in 1172 the monks moved yet again to found Øm Abbey, where at last they were able to develop a permanent site, so successfully that Øm Abbey soon overshadowed the earlier existence of Veng Abbey. The few archival letters regarding Veng were transferred to Øm Abbey and the little information now available about Veng Abbey is due to their preservation there.
The abbey church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was constructed some time after 1100, probably as a replacement for an earlier wooden structure. It was built of limestone blocks, as were many early Danish monasteries, in the Romanesque style. It had a flat timber roof, a single nave, a choir, and an apse with two transepts, each with its own apse. The outside of the church retains several carved stones and other decorations from the original building.
The exact layout of the monastery complex has not been determined, but it is thought to have had at least two ranges, a dormitory, and a refectory attached to the church. Excavations in 1984 to determine the layout were unsuccessful.
The abbey church became the parish church of Veng, while the conventual buildings were converted for use as a farm. Even before the Danish Reformation there were no remains of Veng Abbey except for the church.

Georg Karl Mayer (March 30, 1811 – July 22, 1868) was a German Roman Catholic theologian born in Aschbach, Upper Franconia.
He studied philosophy and theology in Bamberg, then continued his education at the Universities of Munich and Vienna. In 1837 he received his ordination in Bamberg, and afterwards worked as a chaplain. From 1842 he was a professor at the Lyceum in Bamberg, where he taught classes in canon law, church history, dogmatics, exegesis and Hebrew language. In 1862 he was appointed "Domcapitular" at Bamberg.
Mayer specialized in dogmatic theology, and with church historian Johann Spörlein (1814–1873), was a principal representative of Güntherianism at Bamberg. After the Church's condemnation of Anton Günther's writings in 1857, he fought for the recognition and continuation of Günther's teachings, including an appeal to the First Vatican Council.

Towosahgy State Historic Site

Towosahgy State Historic Site (23MI2), also known as "Beckwith's Fort", is a large Mississippian mound site with a Woodland period Baytown culture component located in Mississippi County, Missouri. It is believed to have been inhabited from circa 400-1350 CE. The site is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site. The name "Towosahgy" is an Osage word which means "old town", although it is not known if the Osage were the inhabitants of the site.
History of Towosahgy.
The earliest portion of Towosahgy State Historic Site is in the southern half where a Late Woodland village once stood. Wilkie dates this component to about 400 to 700 CE. Later the site became a fortified Mississippan site with seven mounds, most surrounding a central plaza. During this time, the site was surrounded by a palisade wall and moat. Like other Mississippian mound centers, Towosahgy also had a borrow pit, where earth was removed to create the mounds. The largest remaining mound is Mound 2, also known as the "temple mound". Excavations on this part of the site were conducted by James Price in 1989. The site was abandoned during the late fourteenth century for unknown reasons, like many other sites in the region. 
Ceramics from the site represent typical pottery found in the Missouri Bootheel region. Sherds from the Woodland occupation are typically grog tempered, and the later Mississippian pottery is shell tempered. Type varieties identified include Baytown Plain and Mulberry Creek Cordmarked. Mississippian ceramics were also both plain and decorated. Punctated, incised, fabric impressed, and red, black, and brown painted/slipped sherds, typical decorating methods, are all present. A large collection of ceramic vessels from the site are part of the Beckwith Collection displayed at the Rosemary Berkel and Harry L. Crisp II Museum at Southeast Missouri State University.

Forty Thousand Horsemen

Forty Thousand Horsemen (aka "40,000 Horsemen") is a 1940 Australian war film directed by Charles Chauvel. The film tells the story of the Australian Light Horse cavalry which operated in the desert at the Sinai and Palestine Campaign during World War I. It follows the adventures of three rowdy heroes in fighting and romance. The film culminates at the Battle of Beersheba which is reputedly "the last successful cavalry charge in history". The film was clearly a propaganda weapon, to aid in recruitment and lift the pride of Australians at home during World War II. It was one of the most successful Australian movies of its day.
Plot.
In 1916 Jerusalem, German troops led by Von Schiller arrest French wine seller Paul Rouget for spying and hang him. His daughter Juliet goes into hiding dressed as a boy and starts spying on the Germans.
Three members of the Australian Lighthorse, Red, Larry and Jim, are enjoying themselves on leave in Cairo when called to fight the Turks. They take part in several battles including the march to Ogratina and the Battle of Romani. Red is separated from the others after one battle and has his life saved by Juliet, who he thinks is an Arab boy.
Red is reunited with his friends and they arrive at an Arab village. He meets Juliet and realises she was the boy who saved his life. They begin a romance.
The Battle of Gaza takes place; Jim and Larry are mortally wounded and Red is captured. He is sent to Beersheba to work as slave labour and discovers the town is wired with explosives. Juliet rescues him and they spend the night together in a hut. Jim manages to rejoin his unit in time to participate in the charge of the Light Horse at the Battle of Beersheba, and stops Von Schiller before he detonates the explosives. The Germans and Turks are defeated and a wounded Red is reunited with Juliet.
Production.
Development.
Chauvel was the nephew of Sir Harry Chauvel, commander of the Australian Light Horse during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and had long planned a film based on the exploits of the Light Horse. It was originally to be titled "Thunder Over the Desert".
To raise funds for a movie, Chauvel shot a £5,000 "teaser" sequence, consisting of a cavalry charge based around the Battle of Beersheba. The cost for this was paid for by Herc McIntyre, managing director of Universal Pictures in Australia who was a long-time friend and associate of Chauvel's. Filming of this sequence took place on 1 February 1938 on the Cronulla sand dunes using a cavalry division of the Australian Light Horse, which had been performing in the New South Wales sesquicentenary celebrations. 
The charge was filmed by a four-camera unit, composed of Frank Hurley, Tasman Higgins, Bert Nicholas and John Heyer. A cavalryman was injured during the shoot.
In 1939 Chauvel and McIntyre formed Famous Films Ltd to make the movie. Chauvel used the footage to raise the budget, which was originally announced at £25,000. £5,000 was provided by McIntyre and £10,000 from Hoyts. The New South Wales government agreed to guarantee a bank overdraft of £15,000 although they did not invest directly in the movie.
Casting.
The movie marked the first lead role for Grant Taylor, who rose to prominence in "Dad Rudd, MP" (1940). It was the first sizeable role for Chips Rafferty, who had been cast after a screen test. Chauvel described him as "a cross between Slim Summerville and Jame Stewart, and has a variety of droll yet natural humour." Joe Valli reprised his Scottish soldier from Pat Hanna's Digger Shows.
Shooting.
Shooting began in May 1940. Interiors were shot in the Cinesound studios at Bondi which Chauvel leased from Cinesound Productions for a three-month period. A second unit was used to build a desert village at Cronulla. The battle scenes were shot there in July and August, using the First Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment.
Censorship.
After the film's preview, the Commonwealth film censor, Creswell O'Reilly, requested three major cuts - display of the dancing girls in a cabaret, the love scene between Red and Juliette in a hut, and alleged cruelty to horses during the final charge. This threatened Chauvel's ability to export the film and screen it in Victoria. Eventually the Minister for Customs, Eric Harrison, overruled the decision and allowed the movie to be shot uncut. The movie was also passed uncut in Victoria.
Release.
Reviews were overwhelmingly positive. The critic from the "Sydney Morning Herald" claimed that "there have been some good Australian films before this one, but "Forty Thousand Horsemen" has every right to be regarded as the first really great Australian picture."
It was a massive success at the box office, grossing £10,000 within its first three weeks of release, enabling Famous Features Ltd to buy out the interest of the New South Wales government for £15,000. The film was seen by 287,000 in Sydney alone during a ten-week run on first release. 
Female lead Betty Bryant was sent to Singapore for the film's premiere in June 1941. While there she met MGM executive Mauriece Silverstein who she would later marry, leading to her retirement from acting.
The movie was released in the USA by Sherman S. Krellberg for Monogram Pictures and was very well received.
It earned over ₤40,000 in the UK.
In 1954 the film was cut down to 50 minutes for screening on US television.

Pityriasis amiantacea

Pityriasis amiantacea (also known as "Tinea amiantacea") is an eczematous condition of the scalp resulting in hair loss in which thick tenaciously adherent scale infiltrates and surrounds the base of a group of scalp hairs.
Pityriasis amiantacea was first described by Alibert in 1832. Pityriasis amiantacea affects the scalp as shiny asbestos-like (amiantaceus) thick scales attached in layers to the hair shaft. The scales surround and bind down tufts of hair. The condition can be localised or covering over the entire scalp. Temporary alopecia and scarring alopecia may occur due to repeated removal of hairs attached to the scale. It is a rare disease with a female predilection. 
Pityriasis amiantacea can easily be misdiagnosed due its close resemblance to other scalp diseases such as psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis or lichen planus. However in pityriasis amiantacea the scales are attached to both the hair shaft and the scalp. Pityriasis amiantacea may be present with other inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis or seborrhoeic dermatitis and sebaceous scales and alopecia can occur. According to the dermatology text Bolognia this condition is most often seen in psoriasis, but may also be seen in secondarily infected atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and tinea capitis.
Treatment.
The bacteria staphylococci are present in the majority of cases. Treatment with systemic antibiotics and coal tar shampoo can completely clear the condition when Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are found. Fungal infections such as tinea capitis are known to mimic the symptoms of the condition and can be cleared with antifungal treatment.

<doc id="20919132" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20919132" title="Fishing industry in Russia">
Fishing industry in Russia

The coastline of the Russian Federation is the fourth longest in the world after the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, and Indonesia. The Russian fishing industry has an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 7.6 million km² including access to twelve seas in three oceans, together with the landlocked Caspian Sea and more than two million rivers.
According to the FAO, in 2005 the Russian fishing industry harvested 3,190,946 tonnes of fish from wild fisheries and another 114,752 tonnes from aquaculture. This made Russia the ninth leading producer of fish, with 2.3 percent of the world total.
Management.
Fisheries management is regulated by Russian federal laws. The federal law "On Fisheries and Protection of Aquatic Biological Resources" of December 2004 (referred to below as the "Law on Fisheries") divides fisheries into three main categories" industrial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries of indigenous groups. Industrial fisheries includes coastal fisheries. This definition has been challenged and is under review.
The "Law on Fisheries" requires that total allowable catch (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the "Law on Fisheries" then goes on to state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls for the federal government to issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.
The "Law on Fisheries" also gives a definition of a fishing unit area and sets general principles for their use. The compiling of lists of fishing unit areas is delegated to the regional authorities. The "Law on Fisheries" has gaps and its application is criticized by parliamentarians and stakeholders. It may be expected that in the coming years at least two new federal laws, "On Coastal Fisheries" and "On Aquaculture", will be considered by Russian legislators.
Apart from TAC settings, fisheries are also regulated by the so-called "Fishing Rules" (Pravila rybolovstva). These rules are set separately for different geographical regions.
The "Fishing Rules" specify seasonal closures, closed areas, restrictions on specific gears such as retricting mesh sizes, minimum catch sizes, and restricted levels of allowable bycatch. Fisheries management has been changing since Soviet times, and further changes are likely.
The government has mismanaged the fisheries, with frequent restructuring of the institutions responsible for fishery management and control. Starting in 1992, the fishery authority has been reorganized at least five times. The head of the fishery authority was replaced seven times, and not one of these heads was a fishery professional. The issues involved in regulating fishing capacity were never really recognized. However, consistent fishery policies are starting to be developed now.
The extreme bureaucracy involved for a fishing vessel to make a port call and land fish results in coastal processing being bypassed. Instead, the seafood is just directly exported, unprocessed. Similarly, there are many bureaucratic difficulties in developing aquaculture. Getting a licence to use water and the necessary sanitary certificates is very time consuming, although it does guarantee environmental and health safety.
Artisanal.
There is no legally adopted term in Russia for artisanal fisheries. Artisanal or subsistence fishing usually refers to fishing mainly with traditional gear, with production delivered to the market but also used for subsistence. In Russia, the term covers also several kinds of fisheries classified as industrial, such as salmon, chars, whitefish, navaga, flounders and greenling fisheries in the Baltic, the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas. Subsistence fishing by indigenous groups is also an issue. Indigenous fishers mainly work estuaries, lagoons and rivers (for anadromous fish). Legally, they are bound to use their catch for local consumption only. They are not allowed to sell their catch, but in reality, this is not always the case.
In Russia, poverty contributes to poaching and other threats to fishery resources. Poverty can leave people depending on natural resources to feed themselves. There may be little perceived incentive to protect fish and other aquatic life and to use them in a sustainable way. Lack of awareness and lack of public involvement in managing local resources can result in poaching, overfishing, and other kinds of illegal activities. Poaching by private individuals feeds the industrial IUU catch, and forms a vicious cycle.
The social impacts of traditional fisheries has rarely been analysed. The yearly fishing cycle still dominates life in the traditional fishing villages of the Pomor, dotted around the coast of the White Sea. Fishing has similarly influenced the life style of many indigenous groups, such as among settlers around the Pacific Coast, north of Siberia, and around the big lakes. In the late 1960s, administrative decisions were made to abandon many coastal villages and resettle people in larger settlements. This has disrupted the traditional ways and is associated with alcohol abuse and increased poverty. There is now a slow movement towards reviving cultural traditions. To succeed, there must also be a re-establishment of the sustainable fisheries that allowed such fishing communities to flourish.
Recreational.
Recreational fishing occurs everywhere in Russia. The "Fishing Rules" do not distinguish recreational fishing from artisan fishing, so both are regulated under the same rules. In some areas,tourist fishing is growing.
In 1999, recreational and subsistence fishers took 4,300 tonnes, mostly perches and cyprinids. Later estimates are not available. The most significant recreational fishery by value is the Kola Peninsula Atlantic salmon fishery.
Industrial.
Russia has three main industrial fisheries:
Wild fisheries.
EEZ.
Russia's marine fisheries are based on twelve seas from three oceans which surround Russia, the landlocked Caspian Sea, and the high seas beyond Russia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
The three oceans are:
Marine capture fisheries in Russia’s territorial seas, internal marine waters and the EEZ provided up to 75 percent of the total reported catch for 1996–2005.
Catch profile.
The officially recorded annual value of fisheries is about US$ 5 billion, equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP. The fishery sector has been stable in absolute terms in recent years, so its share of GDP has reduced as the general economy has expanded.
Due to the decreasing catch and a growing export to East Asian markets, Russian fisheries cannot meet current domestic demand for seafood. East Asian markets are more attractive to fishing enterprises than the domestic market. As a consequence, there are increasing imports for the affluent in big cities, with increasing subsistence and recreational fishing with its associated IUU catch.
Inland fisheries.
The biggest inland water is the landlocked Caspian Sea. The biggest lakes are Baikal (23,000 km²), Ladoga (19,100 km²) and Onega (9,700 km²). Russia has more than 2 million rivers, the largest of which are, in order, Severnaya Dvina, Pechora, Pechora, Pechora, Ob’, Don, Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma, Indigirka and Amur. The most important inland fishing area is the Ob’–Irtysh River Basin (about 27 percent). Sixty species are caught in the inland fisheries of Russia. In volume terms, whitefish (Coregonidae), cyprinids, zanders and perch are most important. Set nets are the most common gear used in inland water commercial fisheries. Seines are also used on big rivers and lakes, and small trawls on the big lakes. In 2005, the official catch in the inland waters was 72,000 tonnes.
In the past, sturgeon has been an important catch in the basin of the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea, and in Siberian Rivers and the Amur River. Currently, sturgeon stocks are heavily depleted and under constant pressure from poaching. Inland fisheries are regulated by the "Law on Fisheries" discussed above. However, few provisions refer specifically to inland fisheries, although there are specific regulations for same catchments and river systems. These regulations specify closed areas, seasonal closures, gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes and minimum catch size.
Fishing fleet.
According to the Russian State Marine Register, in 2002, the offshore fishing fleet contained about 2,500 fishing vessels, 366 transport vessels and 46 factory ships. Of the fishing vessels, 17 percent were longer than 64 metres (o/a), half were between 34 and 64 metres, and one-third were between 24 and 34 metres. Smaller boats are registered with the State Inspection of Small Size Fleet. In 2005, the marine small size fleet contained 2,491 boats, and the inland fleet contained 5,500 motor boats.
Fishing gears used are:
An important issue is the age of the Russian fishing fleet. About two-thirds of the fishing vessels do not conform to safety norms. Compared to 1990, by 2000 capital investment in the industry had decreased thirty percent and the number of specialists qualified in fishing, navigation and processing technologies had decreased 30 to 40 percent. The Barents Sea cod fishery is an example of the dominance of elderly and ineffective vessels. Between 2002 and 2005, forty percent of effort in the demersal fishery was by elderly freezing trawlers, which produced only twenty-five percent of the official catch. That is, they were 1.5 times less effective than the other vessels in the fleet. Equivalent modern trawlers are three to four times as effective. The low efficiencies of these elderly vessels also implicates them in involvements with IUU catch.
Decline of stocks.
According to the FAO, important stocks have declined as the result of:
Aggravating factors surround the demand for seafood from East Asian markets, which encourage commercial fishermen to exhaust stocks in Russia’s EEZ. Russian illegal exporters have well oiled links to importers in Japan, China and South Korea. Criminal groups and corruption magnifies the effect, as the short distances needed to transport seafood from south Kurils and south Sakhalin to Japan. Huge fish processing developments in China built on cheap labour encourage the export of further unprocessed fish.
Aquaculture.
Over sixty species of fish, invertebrates and seaweed are commercially cultivated by aquaculture or fish farming in Russia. Aquaculture is based mainly on buffalo, grass and silver carp, rainbow trout, scallops, mussels and laminaria. In 2007 there were 300 aquaculture enterprises.
Aquaculture can be freshwater or marine (mariculture):
Potential development areas for freshwater aquaculture include 960,000 hectares of agricultural water bodies, 143,000 hectares of ponds, plus other areas in big lakes and water reservoirs suitable for cage farming. The National Project on Agricultural Sector development (Federal Agency of Fishery, 2006) has set a target for 2020 of 1.4 million tonnes from freshwater aquaculture and 400 thousand tonnes from mariculture. The federal government is considering a subsidy of two-thirds of the credit needed to construct and modernise aquaculture facilities.
Research.
In Soviet times, the Ministry for Fishery Industry operated many institutes which undertook comprehensive research in oceanography, marine biology, the assessment of fishery resources, fishery management regimes, and the technology of fishing gear and fish processing. The Ministry also operated research ship on the high seas to meet the needs of Russian distant water fisheries.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, these institutes, basically responsible for research in fisheries science, were coordinated by VNIRO, the central fishery institute in Moscow.
In 2007, the regional institutes became formally subordinate branches of VNIRO. Notably, the GIPRORYBFLOT in St. Petersburg researches the technology of fishing vessels and fish processing, while the VIERH in Moscow does economic research.
Education.
Five technical universities are geared to train specialists in fisheries. There are programmes for fisheries biology, navigation and marine engineering, fish processing, processing machinery, the economics of fisheries and aquaculture. Four professional schools graduate middle level professionals.
Nine universities graduate about 120 aquaculture specialists each year. The biological departments of several universities also graduate pecialists in fish biology and fishery oceanography.
The institutes that are traditionally of most importance are the St. Petersburg Hydrometeorological Institute, the geographical departments of St. Petersburg and Moscow universities, the biological department of Moscow State University, the Far Eastern National University, Kazan State University and Perm State University.

Gun Lake (British Columbia)

Gun Lake, often spelled Gunn Lake and also known as Big Gun Lake, is a lake and unincorporated community in the Bridge River Country of the West-Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada, located 5 miles northwest of the community of Gold Bridge. It is approximately 10 km in length and is roughly pistol-shaped when seen from above, and drains via a short connecting creek to Gun Creek, which is an important tributary of the Bridge River, joining it via Carpenter Lake. Lajoie Lake, which is just southwest, is also known as Little Gun Lake and is also a small community. The two together are generally referred to as the Gun Lakes.
"Big Gun" has a summer population around 100 and has a full-time population of approx 20 people and constitutes one of the main communities of the Bridge River Valley, the others being Gold Bridge and the mining ghost town of Bralorne, and a smaller recreational community in the area of Tyaughton Lake and Gun Creek Road, which runs west from that lake on the north flank of Gun Creek.
According to a newspaper article from 1941 written by an early prospector and currently posted in an old mining cabin in Bralorne, Gun Lake and Gun Creek were named because a prospector once lost his Gun in Gun Creek.

Yuzuru Hanyu

Career.
Early career.
Hanyu began skating at the age of four, following his older sister to the rink. He first competed nationally as a novice skater in the 2004–05 season; he skated at the 2004 Japan Novice Championships in the Novice B category, which is the lower of the two categories at the novice level, and won the gold medal in this competition. His home rink then closed due to financial problems, reducing his training time. Nanami Abe became his coach around that time. In the 2006–07 season, Hanyu competed at the 2006 Japan Novice Championships in the Novice A category and won the bronze medal. This placement earned him an invitation to compete at the 2006 Japan Junior Championships, where he placed 7th.
Hanyu's home rink reopened in 2007. He competed at the 2007 Japan Novice Championships in the Novice A category and won the event. He was invited to compete in the 2007 Japan Junior Championships, where he won the bronze medal.
Junior career.
2008–2009 season.
Hanyu moved up to the Junior level and debuted on the ISU Junior Grand Prix. He placed 6th in the short program and 4th in the free skating to finish 5th overall at the event in Merano, Italy. Following his Junior Grand Prix event, at the 2008 Japan Junior Championships, Hanyu placed 4th in the short program with 57.25 points and 1st in his free skate with 124.92 points, giving him a total of 182.17 points to win the gold medal overall in the competition. This competition served both as the junior national championships and the World Junior Championships qualifier, and Hanyu has also qualified by this placement for the 2009 Junior Worlds.
This medal earned him an invitation to compete on the senior level at the 2008 Japanese Championships, where he placed 8th. In February 2009 at the 2009 World Junior Championships, Hanyu placed 11th in the short program with 58.18 points and 13th in his free skate with 103.59 points, giving him a total of 161.77 points to finish 12th overall.
2009–2010 season.
In the 2009–2010 season, Hanyu won both of his Junior Grand Prix events and was the top qualifier for the Junior Grand Final. At the Japanese Junior Championships, he won the short program and placed 2nd in the free skating to win the title overall. This earned Hanyu an invitation to compete on the senior level at the Japanese Championships. He then competed at the 2009–2010 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final, which he won, achieving a new personal best score. At the 2009–2010 Japan Junior Figure Skating Championships, he placed first on the junior level. He also competed at the senior level, where he came in sixth. Based on his results, Hanyu was chosen to compete at the 2010 World Junior Championships. He won the competition after placing third in the short program and first in the free skate to earn a new personal best of 216.10 points, and became the fourth Japanese man to win the junior world title.
Senior career.
2010–2011 season.
Hanyu announced that he would turn senior for the 2010–2011 season. His assignments for the 2010–2011 ISU Grand Prix series were the 2010 NHK Trophy and the 2010 Cup of Russia. In his senior debut at the 2010 NHK Trophy, Hanyu placed 5th in the short program with 69.31 points; in his free skate, he landed his first quadruple toe loop jump in an ISU competition and came in 4th with 138.41 points, giving him a total of 207.72 points to finish 4th overall. Hanyu finished in seventh place at the Cup of Russia. At the 2010–11 Japanese Championships, Hanyu was in second place after the short program, but faltered in the free skate and finished fourth overall. As a result, he was selected to compete at the 2011 Four Continents, where he won the silver medal with a new personal best score.
Hanyu was skating at his home rink in Sendai when the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck his hometown and the region. Water pipes under the ice at his home rink burst as a result of the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. He trained in Yokohama and Hachinohe, Aomori until his home rink reopened on July 24, 2011. He also skated in 60 ice shows, using them as an opportunity to train. In April, he and other skaters took part in an ice show to raise money for victims.
2011–2012 season.
Hanyu began the 2011–12 season with a win at the Nebelhorn Trophy. He placed first in both the short program and the free skate, for a combined total score of 226.26 points.

In April 2012, Hanyu switched coaches to Brian Orser in Toronto, Canada. It was reported he would make frequent trips to Toronto and continue to attend high school in Sendai. After moving to Canada, Hanyu increased his on-ice training to 3–4 hours a day, up from 1–2 hours which had been due to a combination of limited ice time in Sendai, schooling, and asthma. His autobiography, "Blue Flames", was published in Japan in April 2012, with the royalties and part of the proceeds going to the Sendai ice rink.
2012–2013 season.
Hanyu began his season at the Finlandia Trophy, winning the gold medal. He landed two quadruple jumps, a quad toe and a quad salchow, in his free skate; it was the first time he had a landed the latter jump in competition. Hanyu won the silver medal at his first Grand Prix event of the season, the Skate America. At his second event, the NHK Trophy, he scored 95.32 in the short program, a new world record, and went on to win the gold medal in his hometown.

In December 2013, Hanyu went on to win a second Japanese national title after placing first in both programs. He was subsequently named in Japan's teams to the Olympics and World Championships.
At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Hanyu broke his own world record in the men's short program, scoring 101.45 points. He is the only skater to score over 100 in the short program. Hanyu obtained 178.64 points in the Free Skating program and won the first Olympic gold medal for Japan in men's figure skating event, and only the second for the nation, his following Shizuka Arakawa's gold medal in the women's event in 2006 in Turin. His win also marked the first time any Asian country has won gold in the men's event. He is the youngest winner of the Olympic men's title since American Dick Button in 1948.
Skating technique.
Hanyu has executed 4T-3A, 4S-3A, 4T-3A-3A sequences, and even 4T-3A-3A-3A-1A (2013 Fantasy on Ice show in Fukuoka) in shows. He has also landed 3A-3T-2T (2011–2012 Japanese Nationals).He jumps counter-clockwise like most skaters. His combination spins usually include the Biellmann spin and the doughnut spin, both of which are known for their difficulty, for male skaters especially, due to the flexibility required.
Personal life.
Hanyu was born and raised in Sendai, and has an older sister named Saya. He has asthma. He had attended the Tohoku High School where the famous Japanese figure skaters Takeshi Honda and Shizuka Arakawa were also enrolled once. His house was damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but remained habitable. He is currently a student at Waseda University .

Duncan McGuire

Duncan Hazlett McGuire was an Australian musician, songwriter, recording engineer and producer. He was associated with vocalist, Doug Parkinson, in various groups during the 1960s and 1970s; McGuire was also a founding member of the jazz fusion band, Ayers Rock from 1973 until he left in 1976. As a bass guitarist he appeared in several of Parkinson's groups including The Questions (1965–68), Doug Parkinson In Focus (1968–1969) and The Southern Star Band (1978–81). In October 1980 he co-produced and engineered the debut self-titled album by Australian rock band, INXS. He died of a brain tumour in July 1989.
Biography.
Duncan Hazlett McGuire's music career began in 1959 with his first band, The Phantoms, in Sydney. By 1963, on bass guitar, he had joined Roland Storm and The Statesmen, which included Storm on lead vocals, Mike Allen on drums, Peter Maxworthy on lead guitar, and Mark Rigney on drums. They recorded two singles, "It's the Stomp" (1963) and "The Swingaroo" (1964) for HMV Records. Without Storm, The Statesmen also recorded two of their own singles for HMV, "Beach Comber" (1963) and "Slow Stompin'" (1964).
In 1964 Rigney left The Statesmen and Billy Green (aka Wil Greenstreet) joined on guitar as the group became Roland Storm and The Epics, which recorded a single, "Zip a Dee Doo Dah" (1964), and then became The Epics when Storm also left. The Epics also issued their own singles, "Caravan" (September 1964) and "Too Late" (June 1965). As a member of The Statesmen or The Epics, McGuire backed Little Pattie live and on her early singles and her first album, as well as backing other artists including Reg Lindsay, Johnny Ashcroft, Bryan Davies, Jay Justin and Johnny O'Keefe.
From late 1965 to 1968 McGuire was the bass guitarist, alongside Green on guitar, in The Questions, which were a "musically substantial bunch" and they released their debut album, "What Is a Question?", in October 1966. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as containing "sub-Herb Alpert pastiches failed to chart". Early in 1967 Doug Parkinson joined on lead vocals, it was his first major band, the line up also included Ray Burton on guitar and Doug Lavery on drums – both later joined The Valentines and Axiom – and Rory Thomas on Hammond organ.
The Questions entered the 1967 Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds and won the New South Wales state final, they competed in Melbourne for the Australian final finishing second to The Groop. McFarlane described The Questions' first three singles with Parkinson as "minor psychedelic pop classics": "Sally Go Round the Roses" (July 1967), "And Things Unsaid" (October) and "Something Wonderful" (February 1968). By January 1968 McGuire and Green had left the group.
In March 1968 McGuire and Green returned to work with Parkinson for another group, Doug Parkinson In Focus, which also included Lavery and Thomas. That group also won the New South Wales state final of the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, and finished third nationally: behind The Groove and The Masters Apprentices. McGuire, as a member of Doug Parkinson In Focus, shifted to Melbourne where the band "were perfectly in sync with the tempo of the times ... became one of the most popular outfits on the Melbourne suburban dance / inner-city discotheque circuit". In May 1969 they issued a cover version of The Beatles' track, "Dear Prudence", which reached No. 5 on the "Go-Set" National Top 40 singles chart.
Doug Parkinson In Focus, with McGuire aboard, entered the 1969 Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds as a Melbourne-based band. They won both the Victorian state and the national grand finals, both held at the Festival Hall. However, in November 1969, McGuire left Parkinson to form a new group, Rush, with Malcolm McGee on lead vocals (ex-Wild Cherries, Python Lee Jackson, Virgil Brothers), Kevin Murphy on drums (ex-Wild Cherries), and Steve Yates on keyboards. By February the following year Rush had disbanded and both McGuire and Green rejoined Parkinson until June.
In September McGuire was a founding member of a progressive rock band, King Harvest, with Leo De Castro on lead vocals and lead guitar (ex-Leo and the Browns, Leo and Friends); Jimmy Doyle on guitar (Silhouettes, Aesop's Fables, Moonstone); Mark Kennedy on drums (Spectrum); and Steve Yates on keyboards (ex-Rush, Expression). They performed cover versions of contemporary hits, including Jimmy Webb's "Wichita Lineman" and The Rolling Stones' "Jumping Jack Flash", which appeared as singles in 1971 on Festival Records. He rejoined Parkinson for a few months before teaming with De Castro in Friends, another progressive rock group, by December that year. Also in Friends were Kennedy, with Charlie Tumahai on vocals and percussion (Aesop's Fables, Healing Force, Chain) and Tim Martin on saxophone and flute.
By April 1972 Green had joined Friends on guitar and the group released their debut single, "B-B-Boogie", in August. The group performed at the Sunbury Pop Festival of 1973 in January and provided two tracks, "Bird on the Wire" and "La La Song", for the live album, "Sunbury 1973 - The Great Australian Rock Festival". By April that year Friends line up of McGuire, De Castro, Kennedy and Ray Burton on guitar recorded versions of "Lady Montego" and "Freedom Train" for the Various Artists' album, "Garrison the Final Blow Unit I" (June 1973). McGuire wrote "Lady Montego".
In June 1973, with two band mates from Friends, he formed Burton McGuire Kennedy, as a jazz fusion trio. In August they were renamed as Ayers Rock when Doyle (ex-King Harvest) joined. In October they recruited Col Loughnan on saxophone, flute, clarinet, and piano (Crescents, Delltones, Kala) and by December they issued their debut single, "Rock'n'Roll Fight (Going On)", on Mushroom Records. Burton was replaced by Chris Brown (ex-Python Lee Jackson, Kala) on guitar in March 1974. The group released their debut album, "Big Red Rock", in November, which peaked at No. 32 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. McGuire had written three tracks for the album, including a re-worked version of "Lady Montego", which was also their next single. Tony Catterall of "The Canberra Times" caught their performance in October 1975 as they previewed material for a future album which "showed an improvement" over their previous work and noted that "McGuire's bass was always rock-solid but ready to fly at a moment's notice".
McGuire remained with Ayers Rock until August 1976 leaving after their second album, "Beyond" (April), and their second tour of the United States (June-July). McGuire was replaced by John Young on bass guitar. In January 1977 McGuire briefly joined with Mario Millo on lead guitar, mandolin, and lead vocals; and Toivo Pilt on keyboards and guitar (both ex-Sebastian Hardie); and Doug Bligh on drums. As a member Windchase, McGuire helped to finish their debut album, "Symphinity", which was issued in June; however he had already left before it appeared. From 1977 to 1980 McGuire joined Parkinson and Kennedy in The Southern Star Band which also had Tommy Emmanuel on guitar. Other members of The Southern Star Band were Frank Esler-Smith, Jim Gannon, and Keith Kirwan.
McGuire turned to production work, he was the mixer, engineer and co-producer of "INXS", the debut album by the Australian rock band of the same name, which was released on 13 October 1980. It had been recorded from late 1979 to mid-1980 in midnight to dawn recording sessions at Trafalgar Studios, Annandale. Due to the late sessions, McGuire was often "slumped exhausted over the mixing panel". The album provided the single, "Just Keep Walking", in September 1980. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, described it as the "first significant INXS landmark".
In January 1988 McGuire engineered an album, "Long White Clouds", by De Castro and two different backing bands: The Dancehall Racketeers and Roger Janes Band. He worked at the Rich Music Studios in Sydney, the album was eventually released in 2007 by Big Beat Music. Early in 1989 McGuire and David Cafe co-produced an album, "Crazy", by Roger Janes Band, which was issued in 2006. Duncan McGuire died in July 1989 from a brain tumour.

Novaya Chara

Novaya Chara () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Kalarsky District of Zabaykalsky Krai, Russia, located in the basin of the Chara River, in the eastern parts of Stanovoy Range, approximately in a straight line northeast of the krai's administrative center of Chita, and from the district's administrative center of Chara. Population: 
History.
It was founded in connection to the construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline in the 1980s, near the older village of Chara, named for the river on which it stood. The station and settlement were built by workers from the Kazakh SSR; as part of the BAM project, sections of the route were placed under the patronage of Komsomol brigades from different parts of the Soviet Union.
Regular rail traffic from Tynda in Amur Oblast to Novaya Chara began in 1988; traffic from the west of the settlement on the section from Severobaykalsk started in 1989. The completion of the BAM did not bring the expected economic development to the area, and with the economic crisis of the late 1980s, around half the population left. Nearby are the Udokan copper mines and the Chineysky vanadium deposit.
Tourism.
Novaya Chara is the starting point for trekking tours in the Kodar Mountains, as well as the Chara Sands, a area of sand dunes northwest of the settlement, across the river.
Economy.
Novaya Chara's only real economic activity centers around its situation as an important station on the BAM. However, there is potential for the settlement to become the center for a mining region currently under development, with a branch line built between 1998 and 2002 from Novaya Chara to the titanium, vanadium, and iron ore mine Chineyskoye.
The Chineyskoye mine contains both Russia's largest titanium deposit, and the world's largest recorded vanadium deposit. Due to financing problems with the mines, located at an altitude of over , the branch line has been poorly maintained and damaged by landslides, meaning that in 2008 only were in use; with trucks being used to transport ore to the railhead. Repair and reconstruction of the line is currently being undertaken.
Also on this branch line are the rare earth metal mine Katuginskoye, iron ore mine Sulumatskoye, and large anthracite deposits at Chitkanda.
The settlement is also serviced by a small airport.

Charles River Museum of Industry

Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation is a museum located near the intersection of the Charles River and what is now Moody Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. The building was originally built as part of the Boston Manufacturing Company, Francis Cabot Lowell's first textile mill. The mill has now been converted into housing and artist lofts, with the museum taking up only a small portion of the previous mill building.
The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as America's first factory. (Though many mills existed before the Boston Manufacturing Company, Francis Cabot Lowell's mill was the first to combine all steps of cotton fabric manufacturing under one roof.)
Waltham received a $10 million urban revitalization grant, which allowed the site to be renovated and preserved. As part of the site’s renovation, a group of cultural, civic, and business leaders created the Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation in what had been the mill’s massive steam-powered engine and boiler rooms. Following a monumental campaign of fundraising, cleaning, building, planning, and installation, the museum began operation in 1980.
The museum is a nonprofit corporation governed by a Board of Trustees, and funded by private donations.
The mission of the Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation is to encourage and inspire future innovation in America. The museum accomplishes this through its collections and programs, by exploring the historical impact of industry on American culture, by examining the dynamic process of innovation, by promoting its location in Waltham as a foundation of the American industrial revolution, by connecting the expertise of older generations with the inquisitiveness of young people, and by providing audiences of all ages with an engaging museum experience.
Core exhibits cover the area's role in the American Industrial Revolution, though the museum also has a dedicated gallery of the Waltham Watch Company. The museum includes two revolving exhibit spaces that change out anywhere from 3–6 months, covering anything from science and math to cultural investigation. The museum also hosts many events and festivals in the Waltham area, and was the first to host Steampunk City, which was the first steampunk festival to encompass an entire town.

Union Covered Bridge State Historic Site

Union Covered Bridge State Historic Site in Monroe County, Missouri, is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site to preserve the Union covered bridge. The bridge was built in 1871 across the Elk Fork of the Salt River as a link in the Paris-to-Fayette road. Its name comes from the nearby Union Church. In 1968 a partial restoration was completed using materials from the Mexico Covered Bridge which was destroyed the year before by flood waters. In 1970 the Union bridge was closed after structural timbers were damaged by overweight trucks. A total restoration was completed in 1988. The bridge was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.
The bridge is a 120 foot (36.6 m) long Burr Arch span that is 17 feet 6 inches (5.3 m) wide and 12 feet high (3.7 m). Joseph C. Elliot built the bridge in 1871 from local oak. It is sided in clapboard and uses wood shingles. Two earlier uncovered bridges at this site were replaced in turn due to deterioration.
Some siding was removed as an emergency measure in 2008 when the bridge was threatened by severe flooding. Removal of the lowest siding allowed the stream to flow freely through the understructure of the bridge, thus sparing it the full force of the current. The bridge was saved, but the removed siding is still missing while funds for repair are sought.

Birmingham Group (authors)

The Birmingham Group was a group of authors writing from the 1930s to the 1950s in and around Birmingham, England. Members included John Hampson, Walter Allen, Peter Chamberlain, Leslie Halward and Walter Brierley.
Part of Birmingham's vibrant literary and artistic scene in the 1930s that also included the poets W. H. Auden, Louis MacNeice and Henry Reed; novelist Henry Green, the sculptor Gordon Herickx and the Birmingham Surrealists; the Birmingham Group shared little stylistic unity, but had a common interest in the realistic portrayal of working class scenes.
The group was christened by the American critic Edward J. O'Brien, who published several of their short stories in journals he edited and assumed they all knew each other. This became self-fulfilling, and for a while the group met weekly in a pub off Corporation Street.
Although the Birmingham Group are often described as working class novelists, they in fact had the varied social backgrounds that characterised Birmingham's distinctive high level of social mobility. The Birmingham-based poet Louis MacNeice described how

Lajoie Lake

Lajoie Lake, also known as Little Gun Lake, is a small lake in the Bridge River Country of the West-Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada, located three miles west of the community of Gold Bridge and just southwest of Gun Lake, which is also known as Big Gun Lake. The two lakes together are known as the Gun Lakes and both are recreational communities with a history of such settlement dating back to the 1920s. The lake is approximately 3 km2 (1 sq mi) in size and is drained by Lajoie Creek, which drains into Big Gun Lake and from that lake's northeastern end into Gun Creek. The creek, lake and nearby Lajoie Dam and the adjoining small company townsite of Lajoie are named for "Lazack" Lajoie, a colourful French-Canadian prospector and promoter who tried to advance the area of the Gun Lakes both as a major potential gold mine and also the site of a future city.
"Little Gun" is the site of the Little Gun Lake Lodge, a custom-built log-cabin mansion built by William G. "Big Bill" Davidson, who also built Minto City, to host investors and VIPs visiting the Bralorne-Pioneer Mines about ten miles south of Gold Bridge. To serve the lodge floatplanes were landed on the lake, and a helicopter pad was also built on the lodge's property, which is the largest private land-holding on the lake and includes the lake itself. It was from Lajoie Lake that mine promoter David Sloan, namesake of the Matterhorn-like Mount Sloan, which overlooks the lake from the other side of the Bridge River to its south, too off on his last flight, dying in a plane crash at Alta Lake (now in the resort of Whistler).
The lodge was for some time operated as a private boutique-hotel but is now a private residence. In addition to the lodge there are a number of other recreational properties around the lake. As a community it has a full-time population in the range of 30.

Insurance industry in China

The Chinese insurance industry has experienced rapid expansion over the past decade, with annual life-insurance premiums growing from 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 46 billion U.S. dollars in 2006. 
In addition to steadily increasing demand, two major supply-side trends have encouraged the development of the industry: (1) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework, the Chinese government lowered entry barriers to foreign insurers, allowing them to establish joint-venture insurance firms in China; and (2) domestic insurers strengthened themselves through IPOs and other market developments. (For example, China Life Insurance at one point became the second largest insurance company in the world in terms of market capitalization although the value has kept declining since the stock market peak of 2008.)
As of 2007, China had 100 insurance companies, 59 of which are domestic-funded and the rest 41 are foreign-funded. And five Chinese insurance companies including the People's Insurance Company of China, China Life Insurance, Ping An Insurance Company of China, China Insurance International Holdings Co., Ltd. (CIIH) and China Pacific Insurance have listed at home and abroad.
China Life Insurance had about a 50% share of the life insurance market; Ping An Life Insurance and Ping An Property Insurance share 16% and 12% of corresponding insurance markets, respectively ranking 2nd and 3rd.
Chinese insurers namely China Life Insurance, Ping An Insurance, People's Insurance Company of China and China Pacific Insurance were the first wave of insurers to go public. In December 2011, New China Life began a second wave of IPOs for smaller tier 2 insurers.
In Jan-May 2007, the increased insurance assets reached RMB 450 billion, without calculation the value-added of substantive financial assets. At present, the gross assets of China Life Insurance have outnumbered RMB 1 trillion. And the total capital of the whole insurance industry has exceeded RMB 200 billion, 5.6 times that of 2002.
During the first three quarters of 2009 China's insurance companies had generated profits 36.9 billion RMB of which the seven largest insurers accounted for 90% of these profits.
Despite all this growth the industry is still considered in its infancy stage when looking at China's insurance penetration compared to its peers in the rest of Greater China and Asia.
Organizations.
The IAC represents the collective interests of the China's insurance industry. The Association speaks out on issues of common interest; helps to inform and participate in debates on public policy issues; and also acts as an advocate for high standards of customer service in the insurance industry. IAC has four working committees which are Life Insurance Working Committee, General Insurance Working Committee, Insurance Agency & Broker Working Committee, Actuarial Working Committee.
The IIC is the nationwide academic association for research and policy analysis in insurance industry. It offers two publications: "Insurance Information" (Biweekly) and "Insurance Studies" (Monthly)

Rod Denson

Rod Denson was a former radio and television personality in the Elmira-Corning television market from 1959 to 1989.
The Radio Years.
Known as "Rockin' Rod", Rod was a disk jockey for radio station WEHH from 1959 to 1963.
Rod Denson got his start in radio while a student at Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira Heights. Station owner Frank Saia donated a half hour of air time Saturday morning to both local High Schools. Known as "The Heights High School Show" and "The Horseheads High School Show". During each school's respective half hour, a student from that school would play music from the Fabulous Fifty Chart, read announcements about upcoming school events, report sports scores etc. One Saturday morning Denson substituted for the school's regular host and his work so impressed owner Frank Saia,that he hired him part-time immediately after the show. Denson began working after that for one hour a week, the last hour before Sunday evening sign off. Denson eventually worked up to 20 hours a week part-time from October 1959 to 1961.
He was then hired full-time for two years, and could be heard mornings from 6 to 10 on the morning show called "The Town Crier". He was back on the air from noon until 2 PM with the "Rod Denson Show". His last day on the job was in early November 1963. In August 1962 Denson interviewed Les Paul and Mary Ford at the original Latta Brook Studios. Originally the live interview was expected to run 10 minutes but lasted for more than one hour. Rod remembers Les and Mary picking on his wife Midge who was 4 months away from giving birth to Rod Jr.
Rod left his tape recorder in the trunk of his car at Les and Mary's Motel while he and his wife Midge rode to the studio with them. Because of that Denson does not have a recording the interview, something he regrets to this day.
Denson interviewed Chubby Checker at his Motel in Elmira when both were 21 years old, this time he had his recorder and still has the tape of the interview. When singer Conway Twitty was in Elmira to perform, Station owner Frank Saia came up with the idea of giving away pieces of Twitty's tee shirt as a promotion. Twitty supplied a tee shirt and dozens of pieces were given away and some probably survive to this day in area scrapbooks
The TV Years.
Mr. Denson began his television broadcasting career on November 11, 1963 when he was hired as WSYE/Elmira's first full-time chief photographer by General Manager Art Kendall. Local news events of that era were filmed with 16mm cameras using negative film and Polaroid cameras with black-and-white prints. When the 16mm negative film was run through the projector in the control room the image was electronically reversed so it ended up a positive image on viewers home screens. To show the Polaroid prints they were taped to a board side by side, the board was then inserted into a slot on a wooden frame where the prints were moved horizontally. A studio camera was focused on a rectangular slot in the frame where the prints appeared one by one. As the anchor read news script the photos were moved in relation to the story.
In the late 70s Denson was one of the first cameramen in New York State and the nation to use portable color video tape recorders to shoot news events. Denson anchored the Saturday 11PM Newscast alone, doing the local, state, sports, national news and weather from Hawley Hill. There were times when the Saturday newscast was done with only two people in the building, an engineer in the control room and Denson in the Studio. Most of the time there were four people for that newscast, a director, engineer, studio cameraman and Denson.
Denson left WSYE in 1989, then known as WETM, after serving as an engineer for the station from 1987 to 1989. He later would join Elmira College's staff, managing the college's audio-visual department.
A video compilation of Rod's career can be found on YouTube.

Wakonda State Park

Wakonda State Park is a state park in the US state of Missouri consisting of near La Grange in Lewis County.
History.
Wakonda, an Osage Indian word meaning something consecrated or spiritual, was established by the Missouri State Park Board in 1960 on 273 acres transferred from the Missouri Highway Commission. The area is one of the few remaining sand prairie areas to be found along the central and northern Mississippi River. During the Ice Age, glacial movement left large deposits of high quality gravel and sand. Beginning in 1924 the Missouri Highway Commission contracted with private companies to remove the large gravel deposits for use in road surfacing materials. The gravel was very deep, requiring open-pit mining techniques which eventually led to the creation of the six lakes that dot the Wakonda park landscape. By the 1980s some 26 million tons of sand and gravel had been removed from the area. Additional land purchases by the state, including a final 777 acre tract in 1992, created the parks current dimensions.

Memphis Guitars

Memphis Guitars were guitars produced during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Overview.
Memphis Guitars were affordable guitars that were imported from Asia and distributed in the United States by C. Bruno and Sons in the mid-1970s to 1980s. The product line included Fender and Gibson-styled instruments as well as some original designs. In the early years they were manufactured by Matsumoku Industrial.
Memphis also sold pedals, including at least a phaser called simply "Roto Phase", a simple pedal with input, output, and one knob that controlled the speed.

USA 17 (yacht)

USA-17 (formerly known as "BMW Oracle Racing 90" or "BOR90") is a sloop rigged racing trimaran built by the American sailing team BMW Oracle Racing to challenge for the 2010 America's Cup. Designed by VPLP Yacht Design with consultation from Franck Cammas and his Groupama multi-hull sailing team, "BOR90" is very light for her size being constructed almost entirely out of carbon fiber and epoxy resin, and exhibits very high performance being able to sail at 2.0 to 2.5 times the true wind speed. From the actual performance of the boat during the 2010 America's Cup races, it can be seen that she could achieve a velocity made good upwind of over twice the wind speed and downwind of over 2.5 times the wind speed; this means that downwind she was sailing at nearly four times the speed of the true wind. She can apparently sail at 20 degrees off the apparent wind. The boat sails so fast downwind that the apparent wind she generates is only 5-6 degrees different from that when she is racing upwind; that is, the boat is always sailing upwind with respect to the apparent wind. An explanation of this phenomenon can be found in the article on sailing faster than the wind.
Background.
BOR 90 was launched in Anacortes, Washington in August of 2008 after more than 9 months of construction. She underwent initial testing in Anacortes before being shipped to San Diego, California for additional sea trials and development.
In March 2009, "USA 17" (then referred to as "BOR90") was pulled from the water for extensive modification in BMW Oracle Racing's San Diego shop. She emerged in early July, 2009, featuring wave-piercing hulls and other modifications. She was further modified subsequently, in particular in October 2009 to add an engine to power hydraulic winches. 
On November 8, 2009, the team announced that a rigid sail wing had been built for the yacht. The wingsail was initially tall and some 80 percent larger than the wing of a Boeing 747 airplane; it was later extended to . The wing has a very high aspect ratio, meaning that it is very tall and narrow. It can change camber to adjust lift in order to optimize performance. The wing consists of two main elements, separated by a vertical slot through which air can flow. The rear element is made up of several separate sections, whose angle can be adjusted separately, much like the flaps on an airplane's wing. Thus the lift of the sail can be controlled very finely, both overall, and for each section.
The wing is more efficient than a traditional soft-sail rig setup. On November 10, BMW reported that they hit boat speed in a reported wind speed. During the first race of the 2010 America's Cup, "USA 17" was able to sail upwind faster than "Alinghi 5" even without a jib. Since the sail area of "USA 17"s wing is much smaller than the sail area of "Alinghi 5"s mainsail and jib combined, it is clear that the rigid wing is much more efficient than even high-performance traditional sails.
Racing results.
The first race of the 2010 America's Cup took place on February 12, 2010. "USA 17" beat the defender, "Alinghi 5". "USA 17" was behind 1:27 at the start, but was ahead by 3:21 at the windward mark and by about 9 minutes at the finish. Her official finish time was 15:28 ahead of the loser because "Alinghi 5" had to perform a penalty turn, having failed to stay clear at the start.
Winds were . "USA 17" reached the windward mark in 1h29, so her velocity made good was about , or about 1.8 times wind speed. "USA 17" took 63 minutes to reach the downwind mark, so her velocity made good downwind was about , or about 2.5 times wind speed.
The measured wind velocity is taken at near sea level, and does not account for effects of wind gradient with reported true wind speed of at mast head height of over . The measured sea-level wind direction shifted away from 180 degrees between the time of setting of the course and commencement of sailing of the downwind leg, by which time wind direction was reported to be at around 160 degrees. As such the ratio between downwind velocity made good and wind speed is an approximation only.
On February 14, 2010, "USA 17" also won the second race, and thus the America's Cup, again by a considerable margin. "USA 17" was ahead by 0:24 at the start, by 0:28 at the windward mark, by 2:44 at the gybe mark, and by over 4 minutes at the finish. Her official finish time was 5:26 ahead of the defender because "Alinghi 5" had to perform a penalty turn, having entered the pre-start area too soon.
Winds were . "USA 17" reached the windward mark in 59 minutes, so her velocity made good was about , or about 1.65 times wind speed. The course was a triangle, so the velocity made good downwind was only , or about 1.4 times wind speed. "USA 17" averaged , or about 3.6 times the wind speed, on the faster first triangular leg.
Observers stated that the rigid wing had given USA a decisive advantage.

Paul Verhoeven (Australia)

Paul Francis Verhoeven (born ) is an Australian broadcaster, writer, blogger and comedian, and the host of Steam Punks on ABC3. He grew up on Sydney's northern beaches, and moved to Melbourne after completing a Bachelor of Film Studies at the University of New South Wales.
Radio.
Verhoeven has co-hosted "The Somewhat Ambitious", a mixtape-themed show on Student Youth Network, along with Melbourne-based comedian and writer, Luke Ryan.
Since 2008 he has broadcast weekly for youth station Triple J, as the host of the "Nerdy By Nature" segment on "The Breakfast Show" with Tom Ballard and Alex Dyson (formerly known as "Nerds of a Feather" and "Close Encounters of the Nerd Kind").
He has also hosted "The Mid-Dawn show" for four years, has produced "The Graveyard Shift" with Dave Callan, and has written for the Triple J publication, "Triple J Magazine". Verhoeven has hosted the "The Breakfast Show", "Weekend Arvos" and the Triple J "Weekend Breakfast Show".
Television.
Paul is the host and co-writer of Steam Punks, a narrative game show on ABC 3, produced by Beyond Entertainment. Steam Punks airs every Sunday at 5.25pm, and Paul was described by The Australian as "a revelation as host... a mix of Basil Fawlty, Oliver Reed and Johnny Depp".
Verhoeven co-hosted and wrote for "Planet Nerd", a geek comedy programme on Channel 31 Melbourne, which was nominated for Best Comedy Program in the 2008 Antenna Awards. Reviewer Marieke Hardy referred to him as "the hot one". 
He wrote and presented an online television series entitled "Curiageous", a comedic mythbusting series, for the Australian online news site, The Vine. Among other things, he drank his own urine and had his arse waxed.
He narrated "Stop Rewind", a 13-part documentary series on ABC 2, which he described as "truly awful".
He was a presenter on two seasons of "Save Point", a gaming show on ONE HD, which began its second season in 2012.
Comedy.
Along with longtime friends Dan Debuf, Luke Ryan and Matt Saraceni, Verhoeven runs a fortnightly sketch comedy podcast called "Lords of Luxury". They have also performed sketches live as a comedy show in the 2011 and 2012 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and 2012 Adelaide Fringe Festival.
Reviewing their 2011 Melbourne season, "Rabbit Hole Urban Music" called them "endlessly entertaining"; however "The Enthusiast" argued "the fact that sketch comedy is often performed by undergraduates doesn’t make it a place for undergraduate humour, and I’m afraid the Lords of Luxury fall into that trap."
The Adelaide "Advertiser" wrote of their 2012 show, "The dapper devils shine when they delve off script and interact with the audience. The joke is on them and they embrace it."
In Melbourne, the "Herald Sun" opined: "The Lords of Luxury are unlikely to win a prize for comedy writing, but still put on an entertaining show. If their material was half as strong as they are as performers, they'd go a long way."
"The Age" wrote, "A claque of helpless Lords cultists kept up a delirious response from the front tables throughout, pausing only to throw panties at the end. It was that kind of night."
Online and other work.
From June 2008 to April 2010, Verhoeven ran the blog "The Somewhat Ambitious" (the online presence of his SYN FM radio show) along with his Lords of Luxury colleague Luke Ryan.
He is also writer and artist of "Lessons for Children", a weekly web comic. 
Verhoeven is an active and popular Twitter user; as of April 2012 he is the 77th most popular Australian journalist using the social media platform. In December 2011 he called Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard a "whore". His conduct was condemned by his employer the ABC, and he was made to delete the tweet, but defended himself by claiming it had satirically quoted the film "Mean Girls".
He has been a regular contributor for "Yen Magazine", a gaming reviewer and film critic for The Vine, and has written for Filmink magazine and Horse and Hound.
He has interviewed Elmo and Abby Cadabby. On stage, he has interviewed Viggo Mortensen, Philippe Petit, Dylan Moran and Ryan Johnson.
Personal life.
Verhoeven was one of "Cleo"'s Top 50 Bachelors of the Year for 2011, and was named as the second runner up. He thanked Albus Dumbledore in his acceptance speech. He then said 'Go Knicks'.
He is an avid golfer. He cries every time he watches the film Notting Hill.

Remos GX

The Remos G3 Mirage and Remos GX are variants of a high wing, two seat, single engine light aircraft, built in Germany and sold world wide. The Remos GX has been the current model since 2006.
Design and development.
The aircraft is marketed in the United States as a Light Sport Aircraft, and as an ultralight in most of Europe. It is a high-wing design, mostly using engines from the Rotax 912 family. It was developed from the similar Remos Gemini Ultra. The Mirage has the same layout, landing gear and structure but has a span reduced by 1.00 m (3 ft 3 in), is 170 mm ( 6.7 in) longer and is 34 kg (75 lb) heavier. The Mirage also adds an elevator trim tab and electrical flap operation. The Gemini's standard two-stroke 48 kW (64 hp) Rotax 582 engine was replaced in the Mirage by a 60 kW (80 hp) four-stroke Rotax 912UL.
The wings of the G3 Mirage have a constant chord centre section with straight tapered outer panels. The inboard sections carry electrically operated flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. Behind the cabin the fuselage is slender and carries a low set, straight tapered tailplane with horn balanced elevators. The fin and rudder are straight edged and sharply tapered, the latter horn balanced and ending at the top of the fuselage. There is a small underfin. The GX version introduced a long, integrated dorsal fin. The G3 Mirage has a tricycle undercarriage with cantilever legs mounted to the fuselage and with faired wheels.
The prototype and most production Mirages have been powered by 80 hp or 100 hp variants of the Rotax 912 flat four engine. The Mirage RS/L version had a Jabiru 2200 and one aircraft ("D-MPCJ") had a two cylinder, 72 hp Swiss Auto SAB 430 turbocharged car engine, which saved 30 kg (66 lb).
The G3 Mirage first flew on 20 September 1997 with the lower powered Rotax. The first production aircraft also used this engine but had some small horizontal control surface modifications plus the addition of a horn balance to the rudder.
The GX has been the current production model since 2006 and features folding wings and monocoque carbon fiber construction. Its wing has a different airfoil than the G3, improving roll rate and giving better penetration of turbulence. The GX is fitted with either a Junkers or BRS ballistic parachute recovery system.
The GX2009 was introduced at the Sebring Expo. There were improvements to the instrument panel and interior and a new chromoly steel tube landing gear, which replaced the earlier composite undercarriage, is retrofitable to older models.
Operational history.
The G3 Mirage/GX has been produced to meet both European ultralight and US LSA regulations. By early 2009 over 300 of all variants had been sold world wide. About half were in Europe: in mid-2010 there were 156 G3 and GX aircraft on European civil registers west of Russia.
An analysis of the operating economics by "Aviation Consumer" magazine of the G3 versus the Cessna 152 in flight school use during 2013 showed that the G3 cost 50% more to operate than the thirty year old Cessna did.

RVNS Tran Quoc Toan (HQ-06)

RVNS "Tran Quoc Toan"(HQ-03) was a South Vietnamese frigate of the Republic of Vietnam Navy in commission from 1971 to 1975. She and her six sister ships were the largest South Vietnamese naval ships of their time.
History.
Construction and United States Navy service 1944-1946.
"Tran Quoc Toan" was built in the United States as the United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender . She was laid down on 23 August 1943 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, launched on 13 May 1944, and commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 5 November 1944. She served in the Central Pacific during World War II and on occupation duty in Japan and Korea postwar. She was decommissioned in March 1946 and placed in reserve.
United States Coast Guard service 1949-1971.
The U.S. Navy loaned "Cook Inlet" to the United States Coast Guard in 1948 and transferred her permanently to the Coast Guard in 1966. She was commissioned as the Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Cook Inlet" (WAVP-384) in 1949 and was redesignated a high endurance cutter and reclassified as WHEC-384 in 1966. Throughout her Coast Guard career of almost 23 years, she patrolled ocean stations in the North Atlantic, reporting weather data and conducting law-enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. She also served in the Vietnam War for several months in 1971.
Republic of Vietnam Navy service 1971-1975.
Acquisition and operations.
After her antisubmarine warfare equipment had been removed, "Cook Inlet" was transferred to South Vietnam on 21 December 1971 and was commissioned into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS "Tran Quoc Toan" (HQ-03) By mid-1972, six other former "Casco"-class cutters also were in South Vietnamese service. They were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam's largest naval guns. "Tran Quoc Toan" and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore.
When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, "Tran Quoc Toan" became a ship without a country. She fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 May 1975 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected "Tran Quoc Toan" and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: "These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow."
Acquisition for spare parts by the Philippines.
The United States formally transferred "Tran Quoc Toan" to the Republic of the Philippines on 5 April 1976. She did not enter Philippine Navy service; instead she and her sister ship RVNS "Tran Nhat Duat" (HQ-03) were cannibalized for spare parts to allow the Philippines to keep four other sister ships in commission in the Philippine Navy.
The former "Tran Quoc Toan" was discarded in 1982 and probably scrapped.

Greeks in Ethiopia

The Greek community in Ethiopia today numbers about 500 persons and can be traced back to the 18th century. It is mainly located in the capital, Addis Ababa, and the city of Dire Dawa.
History.
The name Ethiopia itself is Greek and means "of burned face". It is first attested in the Homeric epics but it is unlikely to have referred to any particular nation, but rather, to people of Sub-Saharan African descent in general. The Greek community in Ethiopia is first attested by the presence of craftsmen and sailors in the 18th century (1740) in what was then Abyssinia, who played a part in the commerce between the country and Europe. The explorer James Bruce reported that a number of Greek refugees from Smyrna arrived in Gondar during the reign of the Emperor Iyasu II, who included twelve silversmiths, whom the emperor put to work producing a variety of items for both his court and the churches of Gondar.
The community saw its heyday in the early part of the 20th century with the establishment of the Holy Metropolis of Axum by the Patriarchate of Alexandria in 1908 and of the Greek organizations in Addis Ababa (1918) and Dire Dawa (1921).
Present Situation.
In the post-war period the community grew to 3,000 persons. It suffered during the revolution that overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, when the hostility of the Derg towards all foreign communities drastically reduced its size to the current population of about 500.
Today there is still a Greek school located in the capital as well as a Greek Orthodox church in the same city (St. Froumendios). The school has about 120 students, many of whom receive scholarships to continue their studies in Greece. However there is an increasing initiative by Greeks to take advantage of the investment opportunities currently available in Ethiopia.

George Kok

George Kok is a former college and professional basketball player who, at the University of Arkansas, in the 1940s, was one of the first true big men to dominate the game. He was the second overall pick in the 1948 Basketball Association of America Draft, but never played in the league that was the predecessor of today's National Basketball Association.
College career.
Kok played high school athletics in Grand Rapids, Michigan before coming to Arkansas. Because of the shortage of athletes at the end of World War II, Kok was able to play a full four seasons 1944-45 to 1947-48 (versus the usual 3 years of eligibility in most instances up until the 1970s). Standing 6 feet, 10 inches tall, Kok dominated the game from his freshman days, averaging 18.7 points in his first season. During that 1944-45 season, he led the team to the final four teams of the NCAA Tournament, losing to Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State) and its dominant big man, Bob Kurland, 69-41 in the regional final.
Kok went on to become the first Arkansas player to score over 1,000 points in his career, finishing with 1,644 in 94 games, an average of 17.5 per contest. He still ranks number 11 on the all-time Arkansas scoring list at the start of the 2008-2009 season and his career total was not surpassed for 30 years. He was named "The Sporting News" 2nd team All-America in 1945, Associated Press 3rd team All-America in 1948 and All-Southwest Conference in 1945, 1946 and 1948. He twice led the Southwest Conference in scoring.
Professional career.
Kok was selected as the number two pick overall by the Indianapolis Jets in the 1948 BAA Draft, but never signed with the team nor played in the league. He did play one season with Bridgeport in the American Basketball League in 1949-50, leading the team in scoring at 15.0 points per game and helping the team to the league finals, where they lost to Scranton.
Post-playing career.
Following his playing days, Kok became the first athletic director at Pleasure Ridge Park High School in Louisville, Kentucky and spent 24 years teaching at the school.
Kok has been honored by the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame (1988), the University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor (1994) and the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame (2005).

Ernest Spero

(George) Ernest Spero (2 March 1894 – ?) was a British physician, author, journalist, businessman and politician. He served as a surgeon in the Royal Navy in the First World War, subsequently travelling around the world twice.
Following the war, Spero became active in politics. He contested the seat of Leicester West for the Liberal Party at the 1922 general election but failed to be elected.
In 1923 he was selected as the party's candidate to contest Stoke Newington at the general election. The sitting Conservative MP, George Jones, was seen as being safe. Spero, who was also supported by local Labour activists, ran a campaign seeking the votes of ex-servicemen, with the slogan ""We were comrades during the war. Let us be pals in peace"". He was successful, unexpectedly unseating the "impregnable" incumbent member.
A further general election was held in the following year and the situation was reversed: Jones regained the seat, which he was to hold until 1945. 
In 1925 he joined the Labour Party. At the 1929 general election he was the party's candidate for the Fulham West constituency, and won the seat in a three-cornered contest against Conservative and Liberal opponents. 
On 9 April 1930 he informed his local Labour party that he was resigning from parliament through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, citing ill health. 
In May 1930 the reason for his resignation became clear when judgement was given against him in the High Court. Spero had owned a radio set manufacturing business which he had sold in February 1929. The business had been in debt, which he had given a personal guarantee to clear. He did this by issuing unauthorised company cheques to cover the amount which were not honoured. Spero did not attend the case, and evidence was given that he had in fact fled to the United States in January 1930. The court found that Spero was liable to pay over £10,000 to the plaintiffs. In June of the same year a bankruptcy petition was lodged against him. Spero again failed to appear in court, and he was declared bankrupt on 6 August, with his estate placed in the hands of a trustee.

Bernard Corrigan House

The Bernard Corrigan House is a historic residence located at 1200 West 55th Street in Kansas City, Missouri. The building is an important regional example of the Prairie Style, and it was one of the earliest residential structures in Kansas City to make extensive use of reinforced concrete.
History.
Bernard Corrigan was born in Quebec in 1847, and he moved to Kansas City in 1858. Corrigan built his fortune as a contractor, street railway magnate, and real estate speculator. He hired noted architect Louis S. Curtiss to design his grand estate at the corner of 55th Street and Ward Parkway. Corrigan's own firm served as the contractor for the project, and construction began on the home in 1912. The house was completed the following year, but Corrigan died suddenly in January 1913, only two months before he was scheduled to move into his new house. Corrigan's widow sold the property to Patrick J. White in 1914 for $101,370.86. White owned the property until 1917, when he sold it to Joseph J. Heim.
Joseph J. Heim was originally from St. Louis, Missouri, where he learned the techniques of brewing. Heim came to Kansas City in 1884 where he began building his brewery empire. By 1901, the Heim Brewery in the East Bottoms had become the largest brewery in Kansas City, producing in excess of 140,000 barrels annually. Heim and his brothers also opened an amusement park near the brewery in 1899. The amusement park featured Heim beer piped in directly from the nearby brewery. Heim was also involved with numerous other business ventures including real estate, banking, street railways, and telephone companies. Heim lived in the Corrigan for only six and a half years. He sold the house when his wife died.
Robert Sutherland acquired the home from Heim in 1923 for $90,000. Sutherland was a native of the state of Kansas, who moved to Kansas City at age sixteen and began working in a lumber yard. Sutherland began to acquire numerous lumber yards in the early 1900s, which brought him considerable fortune. Sutherland died in 1941, but his widow continued to own and reside in the Corrigan House.
Architecture.
Exterior.
While the house incorporates elements from several architectural styles, the most obvious elements are in the Prairie School architecture, particularly in the emphasis on horizontal lines in the composition. The house is a three-story structure built over a full basement, and it is about one hundred feet long from north to south. The foundation is reinforced concrete, and the exterior walls are faced with gray shot-sawn limestone from Carthage, Missouri. The actual maker of the art glass used in numerous windows and doors is unknown, but the glass itself was most likely supplied by the Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works of Kokomo, Indiana.
Interior.
The full basement contains laundry, heating, and cooling facilities.
The first floor entrance hall features two expanses of stained glass. The ceiling of the hall is two stories, with oak beams lining the ceiling. The main staircase is located in the main entrance hall. The east wing of the first floor contains the living room with large marble fireplace and the conservatory. The west wing contains the kitchen, dining room, butler's pantry, parlor, and a secondary staircase.
The second floor contains at least five bedrooms and two bathrooms.
The third floor originally contained a game room, additional servants quarters, and storage space.

Strangers (thirtysomething)

"Strangers" is a 1989 episode of the television series "Thirtysomething". The episode contrasts two relationships, one between Melissa Steadman (Melanie Mayron) and Lee Owens (Corey Parker) and the other between Russell Weller (David Marshall Grant) and Peter Montefiore (Peter Frechette). Melissa worries about the age difference between herself and Lee as she is several years older. Russell and Peter are in the very early stages of their relationship and are unsure whether even to attempt to build it. "Strangers" was the sixth episode of season three and originally aired on ABC on November 7, 1989.
"Strangers" generated a great deal of controversy because it depicted two men, Russell and Peter, in bed together following their having sex. Even though the actors were forbidden to touch each other while in bed together, the controversy proved too much for a number of advertisers, who pulled their commercials from the episode. ABC withdrew the episode from rotation for rebroadcast.
In 2005, TV Land included this episode as part of its "Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History", ranking it #27.
Plot.
Melissa and Lee have been seeing each other since Lee painted the interior of Melissa's home. Melissa is nervous about introducing him to her friends because of the several year gap in their ages. Lee is beginning to get upset about not meeting her friends. Hope (Mel Harris) and Michael (Ken Olin) invite the couple for dinner. Melissa accepts, thinking it will be just the four of them. However, all of her friends are there and meet Lee. Melissa has flights of imagination at the party, envisioning her friends gossiping about her with Lee and Lee becoming ever more immature, to the point of imagining him in a baby's bib. She begins to distance herself from Lee, using work as an excuse. Eventually she invites Lee for dinner and contemplates breaking up with him. Lee pre-empts her and breaks up with her first. After several days, Melissa stops by the condominium that Lee is painting. She gives him a set of keys to her place and expresses her concerns about their relationship but tells him that whatever happens, she loves him. Lee tells her that he loves her too and, as she is about to leave, accepts her keys.
Also in this episode, Russell, an artist, is preparing for his first solo gallery show. He meets Peter at the advertising agency that is designing the catalog for the show. They get together at Russell's for dinner and end up sleeping together. In the days following, Russell hesitates to call Peter. Melissa asks him why, and Russell says that (because of the AIDS epidemic), this is a bad time to start forming attachments. Melissa convinces him that there's never a "right time" to start forming attachments. Russell drops off a copy of the catalog for Peter and invites him to the opening.
Production.
Openly gay screenwriter Richard Kramer wrote "Strangers", originally including hugging and kissing between Peter and Russell. ABC and the producers agreed to eliminate the physical contact between the men in negotiations. Episode director Peter O'Fallon recalled that the cast and crew anticipated controversy and took pains "to rehearse scene in a normal way, to not make it too provocative or, honestly, too sexual". David Marshall Grant concurred: “We were told that if we touched each other in any way under the covers, that it wouldn’t go on the air. Watching the scene, all I see is how completely stiff we were. We were so afraid we might actually touch. But other than that, it was a very typical day. We shot it; it went fine."
Controversy.
There was no public outcry about the episode before it aired. Following the broadcast, ABC received around 400 telephone calls with about 90% of them being negative. "TV Guide" in its "Cheers & Jeers" column gave the episode a "Jeer", saying that having the men have sex on the first date perpetuated negative stereotypes about the promiscuity of gay men. Five of the show's regular sponsors pulled out of the episode, costing the network approximately $1.5 million in advertising revenue. ABC removed the episode from the summer rerun schedule out of fear for additional losses. The controversy surrounding "Strangers" in the late 1980s, along with similar controversies relating to early 1990s episodes of such shows as "Picket Fences" ("Sugar & Spice") and "Roseanne" ("Don't Ask, Don't Tell"), led producers to refrain from presenting sexualization of their gay and lesbian characters. As noted by author Ron Becker, "So viewers got to see Carol and Susan wed on "Friends", but they didn't get to see them kiss. And fans of "NYPD Blue" could hear male hustlers talk about their johns, but the only sex they got to see involved the precinct's straight cops—naked butts and all. Clearly, chastity was the price gay characters paid for admission to prime-time television in the 1990s."

Napier and Miller

Napier & Miller Ltd. (also Messrs Napier & Miller) were Scottish shipbuilders based at Old Kilpatrick, Glasgow, Scotland.
Company history.
The company was founded in 1898 at a yard at Yoker. In 1906 the company moved to a new site a few miles downriver at Old Kilpatrick after their yard was acquired by the Clyde Navigation Trust to build a new dock (subsequently named Rothesay Dock). During World War I the company built sloops and minesweepers for the Royal Navy, along with merchant ships. It also assembled a number of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 aircraft. In the 1920s the company built passenger ships and Great Lakes traders for U.S., Canadian and Norwegian companies. During the Great Depression the company went out of business having built over 120 ships. The last ship was completed in 1930, and the yard was closed, sold off and demolished the following year.
Ships.
The company built two large, double-ended steam passenger ferries for the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company Limited in Sydney, Australia, launched in 1927 and 1928. They were named "Dee Why" and "Curl Curl" and were in service until 1968 and 1960 respectively. Their triple-expansion, four-cylinder reciprocating engines were built by D & W Henderson.

<doc id="20919781" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20919781" title="FleXtel">
FleXtel

Flextel is a British company that pioneered the use of personal numbering in telecommunications in the United Kingdom.
Company history.
In 1991 AT&T ran a trial which lead in 1992 to the "AT&T EasyReach 700" service of follow-me numbers, on area code 700 in the USA Numbering plan.
Stanford White – a former AT&T executive – brought this to the attention of Oftel.
Lobbying Oftel.
After the Duopoly Review White Paper in 1991 it was clear that there was now an opportunity for small niche players in the UK Telecoms market. There followed a protracted period of lobbying of Oftel by Stanford White (of Numbering Viewed Worldwide Ltd) along with William Goodall (of Goodall Personal Numbering Ltd, renamed Flextel Ltd in 1994). Finally, in mid-1993, each company was issued with a licence by the DTI (now BERR), under section 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1984, to provide telecommunications services. Together Stanford and William had effectively created the Personal Numbering market in the UK.
Company Formation.
In 1992 Flextel was formed by a team of management professionals, some of whom helped found and launch the Vodafone service. As a result of GSM roaming knowledge, Flextel was able to launch the UK's first commercial Personal Numbering Service by December 1993, piggy-backed onto the Mercury One2One GSM network on the One2One 0956 7xxxxx range. Flextel was the only player in this challenging pre-market phase.
The Market Appears.
In 1995 the UK telecoms regulator, Oftel (now Ofcom), reserved the whole of the 070 range exclusively for Personal Numbering, ensuring adequate number availability for the future. This move was fully supported by Flextel and, in June 1995, Flextel migrated its existing customers from 0956 7xxxxx to 070 107x xxxx numbers, the first UK Personal Number service in the specially designated 070 range. This was quickly followed by intense competition from a number of new Personal Numbering providers.

Monte Cristo Homestead

Monte Christo Homestead is a historic Australian property located in the town of Junee, New South Wales. Constructed by local pioneer Christopher William Crawley in 1885, it is a double-story late-Victorian manor standing on a hill overlooking the town.
The Crawley family remained in residence until 1948. The house then stood empty under the care of several caretakers until 1963 when it was purchased by Reg and Olive Ryan, who restored it to its current condition. It operates as a museum, antique store and tourist attraction.
Monte Cristo is claimed to be Australia's most haunted house, with reports of ghostly figures, strange lights, invisible forcefields, phantom sounds and animal mutilations. These are attributed to several tragic incidents in the property's past including the murder of a caretaker in 1961 and the imprisonment of a mentally impaired man for many years in the dairy. During the Crawleys' occupation a young child is said to have been fatally dropped down the stairs, a maid to have fallen from the balcony, and a stable boy to have been burnt to death.
Monte Cristo's reputation is well known within Australia, thanks partially to several television shows including segments on the property. These include the current-affairs show "Big Country" in 1977, the travel show "Getaway" in 1992, the paranormal based game/reality show "Scream Test" in 2000, and "Ghost Hunters International" 14 January 2010.

The European (magazine)

The European was a privately circulated far-right cultural and political magazine that was published between 1953 and 1959. During this tenure, it was edited by fascist supporter and politician Diana Mosley. The magazine was published by 'Euphorion Books', a publishing company formed by Mosley and her husband, Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists.
Overview.
The magazine included both cultural and political segments. The magazine often focused on literature and philosophy, providing a platform for writers, intellectuals and poets. Continuing political themes included Nationalism vs. Europeanism and the study of practical forms of syndicalism. It was initially founded as a platform for Sir Oswald to raise consciousness of his doctrine of Europe a Nation. The publication also stressed the importance that Britain should join the European Community. Although the majority of contributors were pro-Europe, the magazine was an "open forum" thus they did not always necessarily agree with Mosley's political ideas.
Contributors.
As well as editing the magazine, Diana Mosley contributed regular diary entries, articles and book reviews. Several of these contributions were republished in the 2008 book "The Pursuit of Laughter", a collection of journalism by Mosley. Sir Oswald Mosley also contributed a regular column, and used an alias.
Notably, the publication also included contributions by established figures such as Alexander Raven Thomson, Ezra Pound, Roy Campbell, Henry Williamson, A. James Gregor and Hugo Charteris. The magazine also concentrated on publishing up-and-coming British intellecturals, writers and poets such as Desmond Stewart, Alan Neame, Noel Stock, Peter Whigham and Denis Goacher.
Later, the magazine published articles by figures from mainland Europe such as Jacques Brousse, Henri Gilbert, Michel Mohrt and Otto Strasser.

Ravanica

Ravanica (Serbian Cyrillic: Раваница) is a Serbian Orthodox monastery on Kučaj mountains near Ćuprija in Central Serbia. It was built in 1375–1377 as an endowment of prince Lazar of Serbia, who is buried there.
Ravanica was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.
History.
Built between 1375 and 1377, Ravanica is the famous Prince Lazar's foundation, where he was buried after his death in the Kosovo battle. Since then, Ravanica has been a pilgrim's destination and an important center of cultural activities and the Serbian people's assemblies. The monastery has been assaulted and damaged by the Turks several times, in 1386, 1398 and 1436. In the great war after the second siege of Vienna a number of monks were killed and the rest of them, in 1690, took the relics of the sainted Prince Lazar withdrawing, in front of the Turkish offensive. Only in 1717 the only survived among the monks, Teacher Stefan came back in Ravanica and found the monastery looted and deserted. With the help of the local inhabitants he restored the monastery and built a new narthex. The monastery suffered repeated assaults during the Serbian revolution, at the beginnings of the 19th century. The new restoration took place in the mid-19th century. During the World War II, Germans violated and damaged the monastery once more, and detained, tortured and killed its archimandrite Makarije on 24 February 1943.
Architecture.
The monastery church is dedicated to the Ascension of Jesus and was fortified with the strong defensive wall with seven towers, of which only a part is preserved. The Ravanica church is the first monument of the Morava school of the Serbian medieval art. Its ground plan has the form of an enlarged trefoil with a nine-sided dome in the middle and smaller octagonal domes above the corner bays. There are 62 window lights. The church was built in alternate courses of single-line stone and three-line bricks. Valuable ceramic decoration makes use of geometrical patterns, floral motifs, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic shapes.
Art.
The frescoes were not carried out at the same time and by the same artists. They are dated between 1385 and 1387. The middle-register frescoes, which are of the highest artistic value were painted by two artists, one of them known as Constantine, who left his signature on a fresco of a warrior saint. The noteworthy compositions include the Communion of the Apostles and the Adoration of the Lamb in the altar apse, as well as the festival Cycle in the upper registers of the church. The Ktitor's composition was later repainted, and a fresco of Lazar's death was added. It also depicts Princess Milica and their sons Vuk and Stefan.

Clark and McCullough

Clark and McCullough were a comedy team consisting of comedians Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough. They starred in a series of short films during the 1920s and 1930s.
Bobby Clark was the fast-talking wisecracker with painted-on eyeglasses; Paul McCullough was his easygoing assistant named Blodgett. The two were childhood friends in Springfield, Ohio, and spent hours practicing tumbling and gymnastics in school. This led to their working as circus performers, then in vaudeville. and finally on Broadway. Their hit show "The Ramblers" (1926) was adapted as a Wheeler and Woolsey movie comedy, "The Cuckoos". Clark and McCullough starred in the George Gershwin musical "Strike Up the Band" on Broadway in 1930.
Motion pictures.
In 1928 Clark and McCullough entered the new field of talking pictures, with a series of short subjects and featurettes for Fox Film Corporation. In 1930 they signed with Radio Pictures (later RKO Radio Pictures) for six two-reel comedies annually. The RKO comedies are totally dominated by Clark, barging into every scene and monopolizing much of the conversation, with his good-natured buddy McCullough quietly embellishing his partner's antics with subtler gestures and actions. Each film cast the duo in different occupations, which they would tackle enthusiastically if not efficiently. Their names in the films were dictated by their jobs: as lawyers they were Blackstone and Blodgett, as domestic help they were Cook and Blodgett, as photographers they were Flash and Blodgett. Then as now, their fast-paced zaniness is an acquired taste; some audiences enjoy the nutty humor while others do not. The films were re-released in the late 1940s, with exhibitors still divided in their opinions of the team.
Clark and McCullough filmed most of their movies during the summer months, so they could be free to do stage revues during the rest of the year. They appeared in three Broadway shows while their film contract was in force.
McCullough's death and beyond.
Clark and McCullough had completed their last series of comedies in 1935, and McCullough returned to Massachusetts, seeking treatment for severe depression. After he was released from a sanitarium in March 1936, McCullough visited a barber shop where he grabbed a razor, and committed suicide by cutting his neck and wrists. Clark was forced to pursue a solo career; he appeared in Samuel Goldwyn's 1938 musical comedy "The Goldwyn Follies", and reestablished himself on Broadway as a solo comedian in such revues as "Streets of Paris" and "Mexican Hayride". Clark continued to appear on stage and television into the 1950s; he died in 1960.

"Tales of Silversleeve" led to several award wins and nominations for Davey and her album, including a win in the Best Irish Female category at the Meteor Music Awards. There was also a Choice Music Prize nomination for Irish Album of the Year 2007. Although the album failed to chart, Davey received positive remarks from newspapers, radio stations and members of the general public alike, being described as "a bright, bold and breezy rush of imagination, creativity and sheer glorious sounds" by journalist and blogger Jim Carroll.
Background and recording.
Davey performed a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from the album which at this stage was referred to as "Silversleeve". All but two of the songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title "Tales of Silversleeve", was preceded by "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's just say I didn't wipe it with a tissue". The album was produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps.
Reception.
"Tales of Silversleeve" received a largely positive reaction from critics and reviewers in the Irish media.
entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described "Tales of Silversleeve" as "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting "there's a magic about "Tales of Silversleeve" that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good as you remember the first time".
Jim Carroll, rock critic with "The Irish Times", called the record "The most charming pop album you’ll hear in Zero Seven".
Public service broadcaster RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said the album was "even more imaginative" than her debut and gave it four out of five stars.
The "Irish Independent"'s reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as "a record that she can be proud of".
"The Irish Times" placed Davey third in a list of "The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now" published in April 2009, saying "There's no better female songwriter in Irish music right now". Her closest female rivals on the list were Lisa Hannigan and Róisín Murphy at numbers five and seven respectively. "Tales of Silversleeve" was named sixth best Irish album of 2007 by John Meagher of the "Irish Independent" and ninth best album of the decade by Jim Carroll, Tony Clayton-Lea and Lauren Murphy of "The Irish Times".
The album was certified double-platinum in Ireland.

Singles.
"Tales of Silversleeve" includes eleven tracks, including three singles. Ed Power of the "Irish Independent" described Davey's song "Reuben", a number one single, as "a skewed romantic tirade glazed in sugar-candy vocals".

James Stirling (1835–1917)

James Stirling (1835–1917) was a Scottish mechanical engineer. He was Locomotive Superintendent of the Glasgow and South Western Railway and later the South Eastern Railway. Stirling was born on 2 October 1835, a son of Robert Stirling, rector of Galston, East Ayrshire. 
Career.
Glasgow and South Western Railway.
After working for a village millwright he joined the Glasgow and South Western Railway (GSWR) where he was apprenticed to his brother Patrick, who had been Locomotive Superintendent of that railway since 1853. On completion of his apprenticeship, he spent a year as a fitter at Sharp Stewart in Manchester, before returning to the GSWR drawing office at Kilmarnock; he later became works manager. 
On 1 March 1866, his brother Patrick left the GSWR for the Great Northern Railway (GNR), where he became Works Manager at Doncaster, and James was appointed Locomotive Superintendent of the GSWR in his place. Patrick became the Locomotive Superintendent of the GNR from 1 October 1866),
South Eastern Railway.
At the end of June 1878 he left the GSWR for the South Eastern Railway. He retired in 1898 and died in Ashford, Kent in 1917.
Locomotives.
Like his brother, James Stirling favoured the domeless boiler, known as the "straightback" and cabs for the enginemen. Although not the first British locomotive engineer to use the 4-4-0 type, he was the first to produce a 4-4-0 which could be regarded as successful, with his G&SWR 6 Class of 1873. Stirling also invented a steam reverser, using it on most of his designs from 1874.
On the South Eastern Railway, Stirling designed just six classes of locomotive in his twenty years - three of these were of the 4-4-0 type for express passenger work, each more capable than the last; his other three classes were an 0-6-0 for goods, an 0-4-4T for suburban passenger, and an 0-6-0T for shunting. At his retirement at the end of 1898, the SER had 459 engines, of which 384 were to Stirling's design, and seven others had been purchased to outside design; ten more to Stirling's design would be built in 1899.

WAGR P and Pr classes

The WAGR P and Pr classes are two classes of 4-6-2 "Pacific" type steam locomotives designed for express passenger service on the Western Australian Government Railways 1067mm (3'6") narrow gauge mainline network. The initial designs were prepared by E.S. Race and together the two classes had a total build number of thirty-five locomotives, the P and Pr classes entering service in 1924 and 1938 respectively. Both classes were used on express passenger services, greatly improving the economy and speed of long-distance passenger travel in Western Australia, the results of which were most visible on the West Australian stage of the Trans-Australian Railway, the 'Westland Express'.
The need for more powerful locomotives in the 1920s resulted in the introduction of twenty-five P class locomotives which provided a significant improvement in power, speed and economy over previous WAGR locomotives, quickly proving to be a highly successful design. The Great Depression of the 1930s, coupled with the effects of The Great War, thwarted the WAGRs later expansion and acquisition plans resulting in many obsolete locomotives remaining in operation into this period. As a result ten new P class locomotives featuring detail improvements to boilers, valves and bogies were introduced in 1938, a year before the outbreak of the Second World War. The new locomotives became the first WAGR engines to be given names, each bearing that of a prominent West Australian river. These 'River class' locomotives were very successful and proved so invaluable to the operation of the wartime WAGR that eight P class locomotives were modified to their standard. All eighteen locomotives were officially classified as the 'Pr Class' in 1946.
The initial ten P class locomotives were built for the WAGR by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow while the remainder, including the new ten Pr class locomotives, were built locally by the WAGRs Midland Government Railway Workshops in Midland near Perth. One example of the P class ("P 508") and one example of the Pr class (class leader "Pr 521 Ashburton") are preserved in non-working order at the Australian Railway Historical Society's Rail Transport Museum in Bassendean, Perth.
Background.
By the early 1920s the WAGR had obtained only a handful of new locomotive designs since the beginning of the twentieth century and there was a particular lack of large passenger locomotives. The Annual Report of 1920 pointed out the large numbers of obsolete locomotives in service and steadily growing rail traffic, stressing the need for more powerful engines. The most substantial design then in service was the E class 4-6-2s of 1902, of which 65 locomotives had been built for operation in Western Australia and served on a variety of services. Likewise the 20 D class 4-6-4T tank locomotives had helped alleviate pressure on suburban services while the 57 F class 4-8-0s did the same for goods. However, all had been introduced (and subsequently superheated) prior to the First World War, meaning that by the 1920s they were becoming inadequate. At this time the most significant operation requiring new locomotives were the long distance passenger services, particularly on the Perth - Kalgoorlie and Perth - Albany expresses, both of which covered distances in excess of 350 kilometres.
In 1923 approval was given for the construction of ten new superheated pacific type locomotives for operation on heavier mainline rails, suitable for the hauling of the expresses. The locomotives were based on plans drawn up in 1920 under Chief Mechanical Engineer of the WAGR Ernest A. Evans which called for a new design with large diameter driving wheels, a large firebox and a two-wheel trailing wheel for stable operation at speed. The final outline drawings were prepared by E.S. Race in the Midland Railway Workshops and completed in December 1923. Influence for the new P class designs were drawn from both the New Zealand Railways Ab and the Tasmanian R class pacifics.
Details of design.
While initial plans called for a round-top firebox (such as featured on the New Zealand Ab class), the P class was eventually designed and delivered with Belpaire fireboxes, which improve steam production over the more traditional round-top types, but are harder to fit. The P class locomotives featured a wide firebox located behind the coupled wheels and supported by a trailing-wheel. The large firebox aided with the use of poor-grade local coal from the Collie coalfields, south of Perth. This low quality coal had frequently resulted in poor steaming in earlier locomotives, but the P class design largely avoided this problem, resulting in a locomotive 30% more economical than the earlier F class engines of similar tractive effort. The P and Pr class also featured innovations to alter the weight-distribution between the driving and trailing wheels, improving adhesive traction.
Two types of tender were used by the P and Pr class locomotives. The original tender (as designed) had a water capacity of 2,800 imperial gallons and a coal capacity of 8 tons. These were built with the initial builds of the 10 P and 10 Pr class locomotives. The remaining 15 P class locomotives (all locally constructed) were fitted with modified R Class tenders which were shorter, and had been upgraded to have a water capacity of 2,440 gallons and 7 tons of coal. These short tenders were distinctive and referred to as the 'bob-tailed' tenders.
Construction history.
It was the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow, Scotland which secured the order for the P class locomotives in 1924, ahead of several other companies including the Victorian Thompson & Co of Australia. North British was to supply ten locomotives with delivery inside of 33-weeks, which would be in time for the 1924/1925 wheat harvest when the introduction of the P class locomotives would free up other locomotives for use on wheat trains. Accordingly, six locomotives entered traffic in December 1924, followed by an additional four in the February 1925.
The next batch of ten P class locomotives were constructed locally in Western Australia in 1927, at the Midland Railway Workshops. They were identical to the North British locomotives excepting the short tenders rebuilt from those of the obsolete R class engines. This order was extended by an additional five locomotives which were delivered in 1929, giving the total-build for the class at twenty-five locomotives. Several exchanges of tenders occurred throughout the service life of the P and Pr class locomotives, such as exchanging the long tender of an unconverted P class locomotive for the short tender of a later Pr class engine.
The P class locomotives were given the numbers P441-P465 in order of delivery, with 451-465 being delivered with short tenders.
Pr class modifications.
By the late 1930s, with even more engines requiring urgent maintenance and repairs, orders were placed for an additional ten P class locomotives which would be improved through modifications to the boilers, bogies, headlights and valve gear. These new locomotives were constructed at the Midland Railway Workshops. The boilers featured an increase in pressure from 160 to 175psi, which provided more power, and the bogies were constructed in cast steel. These improved locomotives were delivered to the same operating specifications as the original P class, with the same weight distribution and boiler pressure limited to 160 psi, though improvements to the track and bridges on the Perth-Kalgoorlie railway in 1940 meant that they could be altered to use their designed power through the increasing of the axle load from 12.8 to 14.2 tons and the resetting of the boiler-top safety valves to 175 psi. The result was a 9% increase in tractive effort with the same economical running of the P class.
The Pr class were numbered 138-147 and were further distinguished from other classes by the placement of running-board nameplates; each locomotive bearing the name of a prominent West Australian river, such as Ashburton, Avon and Chapman. For this reason the class was initially known as the 'River class'. They were the first W.A.G.R. locomotives to be given names.
The Pr class proved such a success that it was decided to convert eight of the locally-constructed P class locomotives to Pr standard. Numbers 453-457, 459,461 and 464 were rebuilt in this way and the naming practise was continued. These conversions retained their short tenders, and were completed between June 1941 and June 1944, when the demands of wartime traffic required more powerful locomotives.
Following the war ten of the class were converted to oil burners in 1947 and again in 1949 due to industrial trouble on the Collie coalfields, where the WAGR obtained its coal fuel. These conversions were temporary, lasting only as long as the lack of fuel prevailed. In later years the boilers were modified to be interchangeable with the Pm and Pmr class locomotives, which were introduced in 1949.
Service history.
The P class locomotives proved to be an excellent design, being free steaming and easy to operate. They quickly reduced the need for bank engines which were normally need to provide extra power up the steep gradients across the Darling Scarp. In addition to saving time and resources, this freed up additional badly needed locomotives. Better economy also allowed for higher running distances without stops for resupply and higher speeds made for more efficient running of the expresses on which the P class served, primarily on the Great Southern Railway and Eastern Goldfields railways to Albany and Kalgoorlie respectively. Experiments into engine pooling with the P class on the GSR in 1932 led to the adoption of this practice across the system, freeing up further locomotives for other duties.
The introduction of the Pr class revolutionised passenger travel, and as part of a national commitment to shaving a day off the transcontinental express the WAGR introduced the Westland Express in 1938. The use of Pr class locomotives helped to reduce travel times across the West Australian stage of the journey by more than two hours, accompanied by an increase in the permissible load of 300tons by additional 20.
During the 1940s both P and Pr class locomotives were used extensively on troop trains, while civilian patronage also increased during this time. The increased war traffic was so great that it necessitated the conversion of the 8 P class locomotives to Pr standard at a time when lack of available resources and labour had stalled the production of new locomotives, such as the S class until 1943. Both during and following the war the Pr class remained the premier express locomotive, while the P class continued on secondary passenger services, concentrated in the states' South West around Albany, particularly on the GSR.
The introduction in 1949 of thirty-five Pm and Pmr class Pacifics was originally intended to oust the Pr locomotives from express services the later designs proved unstable at speed and were transferred instead to fast goods workings, leaving the Pr class as the only express locomotive in the WAGR. The introduction of X class Diesels in 1954, however, ended their long tenure in this position and both P and Pr class locomotives were gradually relegated to goods and shunting duties. Their adequate tractive effort and economy, however, ensured their survival until the very end of steam.
The P class were withdrawn between January 1968 and October 1969. With the exception of "Pr 528 Murray", which was destroyed by a fire while on-shed at Kalgoorlie in 1950 following an oil leak while operating as an oil-burner, the Pr class were withdrawn between September 1967 and 1970 when class leader "Pr 521 Ashburton" became the last to be withdrawn on 10 September.
Livery and numbering.
When introduced the P class locomotives were painted in overall black with red buffer beams, in keeping with WAGR livery policies of the time. The Pr class wore both the overall black livery and a paint scheme with black smoke boxes, tenders and cabs with grey boilers lined in black. The W class of 1951 introduced the Larch Green with black smoke boxes and red buffer beams livery to Western Australia and this was applied to the majority of tender locomotives, including the P and Pr classes.
The twenty-five P class locomotives originally bore the numbers P 441-P 465, but the surviving class members were renumbered P 501-P 517 in 1947. The initial batch of 10 Pr class engines were numbered Pr 138-Pr 147, while the eight later conversion retained their P class numbers. The 'Pr class' designation was only adopted officially on locomotive registers in 1946, and accordingly saw the class renumbered Pr 521-Pr 538.
Preservation.
Two locomotives of the P/Pr class have been preserved. Neither is in working condition.

The Dr. Don Morning Show

The Dr. Don Morning Show, also referred to as "The All New Dr. Don Morning Show", is a country radio morning show on 99.5 WYCD in Detroit, Michigan. It broadcasts between 5 am and 10 am. The show is hosted by WYCD veteran Dr. Don Carpenter, along with Rachael Hunter, Steve Grunwald and Jason The 300 lb Cowboy.
The show is very music oriented and plays about 8–10 songs an hour and talks for about 1–3 minutes at a time.
Show History.
The show originates right at WYCD, in January 1993 when they hired Dr. Don Carpenter for afternoons (3pm-7pm) at the then talker 99.5 WOW-FM. On May 28, 1993 at 3pm the station dropped the talk format for country with the station branding itself as "Young Country" Most of the airstaff was fired except for Jim "JD" Daniels, Bob Schuman, Mark Elliot, Todd Fowler and Dr. Don Carpenter. Doc stayed in the afternoon drive (3pm-7pm) for a few years. In May 1995, Young Country dropped its morning show "The Moo Crew" and moved Doc to mornings (5:30am-10am) on an interim basis. Joing the show was Linda Lee and newsman Bob Schuman. In November 1995 a new morning show was found, hosted by Joe Wade Formicola. Doc moved back to afternoons. Then in the November 1998, the then program director Lisa Rodman flipped flopped both the morning show (Eddie Haskell) and Doc moving Eddie Haskell to afternoons and moving Doc back to mornings with Linda Lee and Bob Schuman. 
Then on May 26, 2000 Dr. Don's contract expired and he was let go from the station. General Manager Maureen Lesourd did not renue his contract because she was tired of his "Blue Humor" and wanted to move the morning show in a new direction. In late 2000 Doc found a morning gig, this time at B105.1 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Then in late 2004 The Dr. Don Show was ropped at B105.1. 
A couple months later on March 7, 2005 Dr. Don returned to WYCD to host the morning show along with Lori Rigato, Tom Baker, Bob Schuman and Pete Collins. Then on November 25, 2005. program director Tim Roberts let go Lori Rigato, Pete Collins and Tom Baker. The search was on to find new co-hosts. On December 12, 2005, former 93.1DRQ morning co-hosts Rachael Hunter and Steve Grunwald became the new co-hosts of The Dr. Don Morning Show
Personalities.
Dr. Don Carpenter.
Carpenter has been with WYCD since December 1992, when he was hired to "kill the fox" and count down to a brand new 99.5, which became talk WOW-FM. He was the afternoon drive host. A couple months later, Carpenter opened up "Young Country" at 3 pm on May 28, 1993. He continued to host afternoons until 1995 when he moved to mornings; a year later he moved back to afternoons. In 1998, he became the new morning host at "Young Country". That lasted for two years, when he was let go by WYCD on May 26, 2000 after seven years with the station. He then moved to B105.1 in Cincinnati for morning. In late 2004, he was fired from WUBE and in March 2005 he returned to the morning airwaves of WYCD.
Rachael Hunter.
On air she is the news anchor. Hunterl has been with WYCD since December 12, 2005. Before working at WYCD, she co-hosted the "Jay Towers and The Morning Revolution" show on 93.1DRQ. On April 1, 2005, the station flipped to variety hits and the entire air staff was let go. 
Steve Grunwald.
Co-host and producer of the "Dr. Don Morning Show with Rachael & Grunwald", Grunwald has been in Detroit radio since 1997, when he came to Detroit to work mornings with Danny Bonaduce at Q95-5. Before that, Grunwald worked at KDWB in Minneapolis, Z100 in New York and WLUP in Chicago. In 1998, Bonaduce left the station, but he stayed and became the producer for "The Steve Cochran Show". That lasted until December 1999 when the entire morning show resigned. In early 2000, Grunwald moved to 93.1 DRQ to co-host and produce the "Jay Towers and The Morning Revolution" show. There he met Rachael Hunter. In April 2005, 93.1DRQ fliiped from Top 40 to variety hits and the entire airstaff was let go. Then on December 12, 2005, he became the co-host and producer of "The Dr. Don Morning Show With Rachael & Grunwald".

Diana van Berlo

Diana van Berlo (born 1966 in Helmond, North Brabant, Netherlands) is a Dutch pop female singer. She was a member of the girl group Luv' from 1989 to 1992. She scored with the female formation a Dutch and Flemish Top 30 hit with the single Welcome to my party as well as another minor hit song He's My Guy. After Luv' had disbanded in 1992, she formed with Carina Lemoine the short-lived girl duo Lady's D.C. In recent years, she has been a backing singer and has sung in dinner shows.
Early years.
Diana van Berlo started a semi professional singing career in the 1980s in Dutch clubs using the stage name Sharon Vice. She took part in local talent shows. She worked in accountancy in a transport company before joining Luv'.
Luv' (1989-1992).
In late 1988 there were speculations about a reunion of Luv's original line-up (Patty Brard, José Hoebee and Marga Scheide). The British hitmakers Stock Aitken Waterman were planned to produce a comeback record. However, this project didn't come off. Moreover, Patty and José didn't want to be part of the trio anymore (but they would later participate in two reunions). Marga was the only member to carry on. Assisted by her partner (producer Jacques Zwart), she recruited two girls to launch a renewed version of the group: Michelle Gold (replaced by Carina Lemoine in the summer of 1990) and Diana van Berlo.
The new Luv' act recorded an EP entitled For You mainly supervised by English producer Nigel Wright. The Dance pop songs on this recording were inspired by the sound of PWL (Kylie Minogue, Mel & Kim, Bananarama or Rick Astley...). Four tracks were taken from the EP to be released as singles (among them Welcome to my party, a Top 30 hit in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). Diana's first live show with Luv' took place in a discothèque (Four Roses) in Hilversum with special guests (including John de Mol) on September 10, 1989. Soon after, Diana and her colleagues were involved with other Dutch girl groups (Frizzle Sizzle, Mai Tai...) in the All Stars project to help Third World children with the single "Star Maker".
In 1991, the album Sincerely Yours (including the minor hit single He's My Guy) was released but didn't top the charts at all.<br> 
Though the new formation wasn't as successful as the original one, the trio extensively toured the club circuit and often performed on TV (they even appeared in a special ("Luv' in Thailand") in 1991). Their busy schedule included a special performance in Dubai to support the Dutch troops during the Gulf War.
In late 1992, Luv' disbanded.
Post Luv' career.
After Luv', Diana teamed up with Carina Lemoine to form a female pop duo: Lady's D.C. The two singers recorded in 1994 a single ("Now is the time") released by RCA/BMG. They rapidly ended their professional relationship. Then Diana went solo. She later became a backing vocalist for other Dutch acts. She has recently taken part in "4 acts", a music and comedy show. In 2009, she is involved in a dinner show "Theater Op Het Water" in Rotterdam on a boat ("De Ameland") on the Meuse. In addition to her artistic activities, she currently works in Helmond at Fashionwheels, a warehousing and distribution company dedidated to the fashion industry.

1981 warning strike in Poland

In the early spring of 1981, the quickly growing Solidarity movement faced one of the biggest challenges in its short history, when during the Bydgoszcz events, several members of Solidarity, including Jan Rulewski, Mariusz Łabentowicz and Roman Bartoszcze, were brutally beaten up by the Communist security services, such as Milicja Obywatelska and ZOMO. The "Bydgoszcz events" soon became widely known across Poland, and on March 24, 1981, Solidarity decided to go on a nationwide strike in protest against the violence. The strike was planned for Tuesday, March 31, 1981. On March 25, Lech Wałęsa met Deputy Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski of the Polish United Workers' Party, but their talks were fruitless. Two days later, a four-hour national warning strike took place. It was the biggest strike in the history of the Soviet Bloc, it has also been called the largest strike in the history of Communism. According to several sources, between 12 million and 14 million Poles took part in it.
Background.
After the Bydgoszcz events, millions of Poles reacted angrily to the brutal beatings of the members of Solidarity. The atmosphere in the country got even more tense, when the Communist government of the People's Republic of Poland denied any wrongdoings, stating that the security services were simply doing their duty to restore order and the information on the beatings was described as "claims by Solidarity sources". The mass-media informed that Jan Rulewski, one of the beaten activists, had been hurt in a car accident, not as a result of the intervention of the Communist police. Furthermore, in early spring of 1981, the Soviet Army was carrying out huge military exercises named Soyuz 81, which were taking place in Poland. The maneouvers were regarded by many Poles as the preparation of a Soviet invasion of their country and Marshall Viktor Kulikov, Commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, told Polish general staff that despite political situation, the exercises would continue indefinitely. In Washington, the situation in Poland was described as "political tension at its highest level since last November". Soviet military exercises continued until April 7.
Meanwhile, leaders of Solidarity, gathered in the meeting of National Coordinating Commission ("Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza"), ordered all regional offices of the organization to stay alert and be prepared for a national strike. In Bydgoszcz, a two-hour warning strike took place (March 21), and in a special communique, Solidarity announced that the Bydgoszcz events was a provocation, aimed at the government of Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski. The government responded by sending to Bydgoszcz a special commission, headed by General Jozef Zyto, Deputy Prosecutor-General, whose task was to clear out the situation and find out who was guilty of the beating of the Solidarity activists. However, its members were not interested in fulfilling their task and their inactivity was criticized by Solidarity. Opposition activists were personally insulted by the Bydgoszcz events, thinking that if the beatings could happen to Jan Rulewski, they could happen to any of them. A statement of the Communist party did not improve the situation, as it characterized the Bydgoszcz events as a "flagrant violation of law, which created new tensions".
Most members of Solidarity's National Coordinating Commission (NCC) were in favor of an all-national, general strike, which would completely paralyze the country until all details of the Bydgoszcz events had been explained and those guilty punished. Only few were against such action, among others, Bronisław Geremek, who said that the decision for an unlimited general strike would be a decision for a national insurrection. Finally, during the March 23, 1981 meeting in Bydgoszcz, majority of members of the National Coordinating Commission voted in favor of the moderate proposal, suggested by Lech Wałęsa. According to this project, a four-hour national warning strike would take place on Friday, March 27, 1981, between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. Wałęsa's proposal was accepted only after a heated all-night session, during which the Solidarity leader threatened to walk out. The Polish Catholic Church and its leader, Primate Stefan Wyszyński, did do its best to convince both sides to avoid open conflict. On March 22, during the service transmitted by the Polish Radio, Wyszyński appealed both to the government and Solidarity to "work out mutual rights and duties", he also mentioned several times the danger of a 'foreign factor'. On March 26, Wyszyński personally talked with General Jaruzelski, two days later, he met Wałęsa and other Solidarity activists.
The demands of the opposition were:
If no agreement between the government and Solidarity had been reached, the general strike was planned for Tuesday, March 31. In between, a meeting between representatives of the NCC, headed by Wałęsa, and members of the Council of Ministers' Committee for Trade Unions, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski took place in Warsaw, but it ended without agreement. During this meeting, a Solidarity activist from Szczecin, yelled at Rakowski: "What if your wife cheats on you once, twice, three times? Will you trust her? And we do not trust you any longer".
The strike.
Timothy Garton Ash, who was in Poland at that time, wrote that Solidarity's mobilisation of its members was swift and effective, making it "the most impressive democratic mass mobilization of any modern European society in peacetime, against its rulers' wishes". In his opinion, Poland looked like a country going to war, with national red and white flags everywhere, and the women making red and white armbands for men who were to guard the occupied factories. The National Strike Committee was established in Gdańsk, in the cradle of Solidarity — the Lenin Shipyard. Its members were Lech Wałęsa, Andrzej Gwiazda, Zbigniew Bujak, Andrzej Cierniewski, Lech Dymarski, Krzysztof Gotowski, Marian Jurczyk, Ryszard Kalinowski, Antoni Kopczewski, Bogdan Lis and Andrzej Słowik. 
Soon came three Solidarity's instructions to the workers: 
Apart from the National Strike Committee, several Interfactory Founding Committees (MKZ) were created in major cities. For security reasons, these offices were moved to large factories for the time of the strike, no matter how long it was planned to be. Therefore:
The preparations of strike reflected an unprecedented level of planning, and in effect, Poland became dotted with worker fortresses, patrolled by round-the-clock guards and the strike itself is until today regarded as the biggest organizational success of Solidarity, with virtually all working people of Poland participating in it. Historians from the Institute of National Remembrance claim that in late March 1981, Solidarity was at the "peak of its popularity", and this fact was reflected on Friday, March 27, 1981. The strike itself took place "in an atmosphere of calm, order, and dignity.". 
Even though virtually all Polish workers took part in it, basic services and crucial industrial plants, such as steelworks and armament factories, were operating without breaks. Nevertheless, Solidarity announced that these plants would go on strike as well, in case of armed intervention. Almost all schools, universities and colleges joined the strike, as well as public TV (back then, there were no private TV stations in Poland). Television screens in Poland showed during the four hours of protest the words "Solidarity-Strike" and the whole country was brought to a halt. Those who had to keep working, like employees of hospitals, put on white-red armbands, to express their solidarity.
Aftermath.
After four hours, at midday, the sirens across the country sounded and Poland went back to work. The magnitude of the strike shocked the leadership of the Polish Communist party, especially when it turned out that members of the party had universally participated in it (at that time, Solidarity had some 9 million members, but 12-14 million people took part in the strike). Meanwhile, Lech Wałęsa's advisors, such as Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronisław Geremek and representatives of the Catholic Church, told the leader of Solidarity that the general strike, planned for March 30, would mean civil war and the risk was too high. Diplomats from Western countries were also aware of the tense situation in Poland; therefore, military attaches from the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany were ordered not to leave Poland. In case of a Soviet invasion of Poland, the Americans were planning a military blockade of Cuba.
On March 28, 1981, Lech Wałęsa, together with a delegation of Solidarity, met Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński. The Primate appealed to them to act with moderation. Two days later, the government of Poland reached the so-called Warsaw Agreement with Solidarity. The Communists conceded to demands regarding police brutality, but the agreement to legalize Rural Solidarity was postponed, as well as further steps on the issue of political prisoners. The government acknowledged its mishandling of the Bydgoszcz events, and in return, Lech Wałęsa agreed to postpone the general strike.

The Getting of Wisdom (film)

The Getting of Wisdom is a 1977 Australian film directed by Bruce Beresford and based on the 1910 novel by the same name by Henry Handel Richardson.
The film is set in 1890s Victoria, when Laura (Susannah Fowle) enters an exclusive Melbourne ladies' college based on Presbyterian Ladies' College. The film follows her struggle for acceptance, conformity, romance, friendship and achievement over the next four years. The lesbian overtones between two school girls are obvious in the film, more so than in Richardson’s novel.
It also starred Barry Humphries, John Waters and Terence Donovan, and featured early career appearances by Kerry Armstrong, Sigrid Thornton, Noni Hazlehurst, Maggie Kirkpatrick and Julia Blake. 
A musical theme runs through the story, with piano works by Beethoven, Schubert and Thalberg played by Sarah Grunstein.
Plot.
Laura Rambotham is sent to attend boarding school in Melbourne at the turn of the century. During her second year she tells everyone about a made up romance between herself and the school's minister, Reverend Shepherd. She forms an attachment with an older girl, Evelyn. When Evelyn leaves, Laura throws herself into her studies and wins the school literary and music prizes.
Production.
Bruce Beresford wanted to make the film after "The Adventures of Barry McKenzie" (1972) and tried to get finance from Reg Grundy. Grundy said he would think about it if Beresford made a McKenzie sequel. Beresford made "Barry McKenzie Holds His Own" (1974) but Grundy declined to make "Wisdom".
The film was the first production from the newly formed Victorian Film Corporation, who provided $100,000 with additional funding from the Australian Film Commission and the Nine Network. Six thousand girls were interviewed for the school pupil roles. It was shot at the Methodist Ladies' College and in the town of Eddington in January and February 1977.
Box office.
"The Getting of Wisdom" grossed $982,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $4,517,200 in 2009 dollars.
Awards.
"The Getting of Wisdom" was nominated for 5 AFI Awards in 1978 and won in the Best Adapted Screenplay (Eleanor Witcombe) category.

Fevralsk

Fevralsk () is an urban locality (a work settlement) in Selemdzhinsky District of Amur Oblast, Russia, located between the Selemdzha River and its tributary the Byssa, about northeast of Blagoveshchensk, the oblast's administrative center, and southwest of Ekimchan, the administrative center of the district. Population: 
History.
The village of "Fevralskoye" () was founded in February 1896 by settlers from Central Russia; the name was derived from the Russian word "" ("fevral"), meaning "February".
In 1974, the village became one of the most important support bases for construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM). The station and the settlement were built by workers from Krasnoyarsk Krai; as part of the construction of the BAM, various sections and towns along the route were placed under the patronage of Komsomol brigades from different parts of the Soviet Union.
In 1982, the village was given its current name and was granted urban-type settlement status. Regular rail traffic on the BAM section from Tynda to Komsomolsk-on-Amur began in 1989. Many inhabitants left the settlement after completion of the rail line. However, in contrast to most other settlements along the BAM, the population has once again begun to increase, with a population of 4,904 according to the 2006 estimates.
Economy.
Logging is conducted in the area around Fevralsk, mainly for export to nearby China.
Transportation.
Fevralsk is an important station on the BAM, located from Tayshet, and is the biggest settlement on the over 1,000 km-long section between Tynda and Novy Urgal. The rail line crosses the Selemdzha and the Byssa Rivers close to the settlement, over two bridges which are, respectively, and long. A long branch line is being built north to the Ogodzha coal fields.

Kaben

Kaben or Kaven is a small island in the Maloelap Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Together with a few other small islands, it forms part of the "outer islands" of the Marshalls and is situated at the northwestern most tip of the atoll. It is the largest island and one of the few inhabited ones on the atoll.
Geography.
Kaben is a small island, no more than 2.5 kilometers long and a kilometer across. The island has around in area. It is almost rectangularly-shaped, with a slight hooklike protuberance on the northeastern region of the island. Kaben is lightly inhabited, having had a few man-made structures erected along its southeast coast.
History.
Historically, the island has been claimed by the "Iroij", royalty of the islands, as their personal property prohibiting peasant islanders from fishing the island's waters. Fishing by local islanders only resumed when an official government for the islands was formed and fishing was officially declared permissible. As the largest island in the atoll, "Iroij" coronation events have traditionally taken place on Kaben. The island has several myths and legends surrounding it and its remote waters.
Fauna.
The fauna of the island is similar to that of the other islands in the Marshalls. Terrestrial fauna is limited to small crustaceans such as the hermit crabs "Coenobita" and land crabs from the family Gecarcinidae. Historically, the island has been cited as the home for a large population of edible coconut crabs.
Airport.
The island has an airport, Kaben Airport . However, airport is a misnomer. It is a simple airstrip without any major airport facilities. A 2000 Technical Assistance Report by the Asian Development Bank suggested that, for infrastructure development, the runways of several airstrips throughout the Marshall Islands, including the one on Kaben, be rehabilitated. This rehabilitation was suggested to include de-forestation of the vegetation surrounding the airstrip and the construction of adequate aero-navigational facilities.

<doc id="20920323" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20920323" title="First flush device">
First flush device

A first flush device is a method of reducing or eliminating first flush of bird droppings, dust, and other airborne contaminants from rainwater harvesting from roof tops especially in the urban and dry remote setting.
Types.
There are several methods including but not limited to:
Overflow example.
An example of an over flow type first flush device for a high pollution load area, such as where there are birds, leaves, seeds, and moss in an urban setting, can be constructed from PVC down pipes in the following manner. The distinguishing feature of this method is the collection pipe is submerged before any water is collected. This prevents 90% of moss, algae, liken, small seeds, and partially digested bird dropping from entering the storage system. This is an important modification to most commercially available systems. Another important feature is the inner tube, and its length. This inner tube helps to settle sediment by keeping the agitation zones away from the collection point. This prevents or vastly reduces the agitated particles from becoming collected.
It is a large diameter pipe (around ) used in a vertical orientation with a cap at its lower end with a normal down pipe sized inner pipe and collection pipe. 
This cap has a small bleed hole (or ball valve), and cleaning access. 
A hole towards the top of this pipe is provided for the water to exit into the water storage.This collection pipe extends into the outer pipe and has a 90 degree bend, and extends down ward between the inner and outer pipes about 1/6 of the length of the outer pipe up to . The collection pipe has a removable gauze to prevent leaves exiting the pipe and insects and their larvae breeding in the pipe(s) and entering the water collection tank(s).
An inner pipe of a smaller diameter extends from the top of the large pipe (co-axially) about 1/3 of the length of the outer larger pipe, down past the exit point. 
The water enters from the top and down the inner tube. At this point the water starts to bleed out the bleed hole which goes into the grey water system, a garden watering system, or drain. As the flow from the roof exceeds the bleed amount, the tube fills up, depositing any heavy material in the lower part of the tube, most of which flushes out the bleed hole. Some debris floats, (such as seeds, leaves, insect bodies) and remains floating between the inner and outer pipe, it is prevented from entering the collection pipe due to the entry of the collection pipe being submerged under water.
Sizing.
The capacity can be increased by extending the pipe near horizontally or even in a "T" at the bottom providing the bleed holes allow complete draining to prevent water pooling and insect breeding. Inspection and cleaning caps must also be accommodated. Some first flush devices are constructed from large plastic 200 Litre drums. Drinking water requires a larger flush than water used for washing clothes. Yet other sources including "Texas Water Development Board's Texas Guide to Rainwater Harvesting" recommend 1 to 2 Gallons per of roof collection area.
The size of the first flush is dependent on rubbish load in the area. A rule of thumb for a heavy pollution load is for the first 2 mm of rain to be contained 
in the tube or drum if intended for drinking water. Size is roughly given by 2 x Area (in meters squared) = volume of first flush device in Litres.
Drinking water.
Water collected in this manner will need treatment for waterborne pathogens and dissolved toxins.
A two stage 0.5 micrometre activated carbon filter should also be considered among other methods available.
Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) can be toxic to humans and animals and its toxin can be released by the process of boiling water, thus it must be removed before any other treatment via flitration.

Canadian Press Cable Service

The Canadian Press Cable Service (formerly CableStream) is a text-only headline news service provided by the Canadian Press and distributed by Canadian cable television companies. The service is also commonly known as "Broadcast News", after the former CP division originally responsible for CableStream.
The CP Cable Service usually appears as a dedicated cable channel, either as scrolling text or a series of text panels. However, the service does not have a uniform appearance, as its presentation varies from one cable company to the next, and it may appear with or without advertising. Typically it is accompanied with Muzak-type background music. As alphanumeric data, the CP Cable Service has never been subject to Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licensing.
In the early days of cable TV, many Canadian cable companies would carry the service on a "restricted" channel, i.e. a frequency on which a local TV station was broadcasting over-the-air. Since the broadcast station might interfere with whatever channel was placed at that position by the cable company, CableStream provided an easy, low-risk means of filling that position. However, with increased pressures on analog cable capacity since the late 1990s, many systems have dropped the channel or moved it to digital cable.
In St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Cable Atlantic (and later Rogers Cable) used CableStream until 2006 in place of blacked-out commercial breaks on the regional cable channel ASN, due to a since-removed CRTC condition of licence intended to protect local station NTV.

United States Ambassador to Bangladesh

The United States Ambassador to Bangladesh is the official representative of the President of the United States to the head of state of Bangladesh.
Since the Mogul Dynasty ceased after the take over by the Crown, the emergence and dissolvement of the Bengal Presidency and the Bengal Province under the British Empire took place. With the termination of British rule in 1947, Bengal was divided into two provinces, West and East Bengal. East Bengal had become a part of Pakistan, named East Pakistan and remained so until 1971. On 26th March 1971, East Pakistan officially seceded, and was to be called Bangladesh and declared itself independent through a radio transmission from Kalurghat, Chittagong, by Major Ziaur Rahman, XO(Executive Officer) of 8th East Bengal Regiment. An official interim government was establish on April 10th 1971, that was called "Probashi Sharkar" led by Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed and the Commander in Chief Colonel M.A.G. Osmani of BDF with 11 Sectors. The administration and most of its political leaders took refuge in India. After the war ended with West Pakistan, Bangladesh Forces(BDF) and the interim government under official Indian control since 21st November 1971 remained in Bangladesh through until March 17th 1971. After the departure of the Indian forces and administration officially in March 19th, many nations initiated diplomatic relations with Bangladesh. The United States followed immediately by initiating recognition of Bangladesh. In May of 1972 the United States government opened of its establishment diplomatic residence with Bangladesh. In January 1972 the nation established its new constitution.
The embassy in Dhaka was established on May 18, 1972, with Herbert D. Spivack as "Chargé d’Affaires ad interim". Daniel O. Newberry served as "Chargé d’Affaires ad interim", October 1972–April 1974. The first ranking ambassador arrived in April 1974. Relations have been continuous and developing since that time.

House of Assembly of South Africa

The House of Assembly (known in Afrikaans as the "Volksraad", or "People's Council") was the lower house of the Parliament of South Africa from 1910 to 1981, the sole parliamentary chamber between 1981 and 1984, and latterly the white representative house of the Tricameral Parliament from 1984 to 1994, when it was replaced by the current National Assembly. Throughout its history, it was exclusively constituted of white members who were elected to office predominantly by white citizens, though until 1960 and 1970, respectively, some Black Africans and Coloureds in the Cape Province enjoyed a restricted form of suffrage.
Method of election.
The members were elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member electoral divisions. Following the abolition of the Senate in 1981, the membership of the House of Assembly was enlarged, with eight additional indirectly elected members, being elected by other members by means of proportional representation, and four being appointed by the State President.
Franchise.
The South Africa Act 1909 provided that the franchise in each province should be the same as that in the corresponding colony before the Union, until altered by the Union Parliament. The Act included entrenching clauses, providing that black and coloured voters could only be removed from the common voters roll in the Cape of Good Hope, by legislation passed by a two-thirds majority by both houses of Parliament in joint session.
The franchise, in all parts of the Union, was initially limited to men over the age of 21. White women were enfranchised in 1929 and the remaining property and income qualifications affecting white men were abolished in 1930. The voting age was reduced to 18 in the 1960s. There were some additional qualifications and disqualifications which varied between provinces.
The voters in the Orange Free State, Transvaal and South-West Africa had to be qualified white people, throughout the whole period when those areas were represented in the House of Assembly.
Cape Franchise.
The Cape of Good Hope had a franchise based on property and wage qualifications, open to people of all races. At the time of the National Convention in 1908, which drafted the terms of what became the South Africa Act, "22,784 Native and Coloured persons out of a total of 152,221 electors" were entitled to vote in Cape elections.
From 1930, the traditional Cape franchise only affected non-white electors. The 1929 and 1930 extensions of white voting rights were not granted to the non-white majority of the population.
Until 1937, a small number of blacks in the Cape Province were included on the common voters' roll. Under the Representation of Natives Act (1936), three white members were elected to represent black voters in the province, with the voters' roll being limited to only 11 000.
In 1960, these seats were abolished.
Similarly the coloured voters in Cape Province were removed from the common (or general roll), under the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, although as the Act was challenged during the Coloured vote constitutional crisis and not completely enforced until the later 1950s, the last year to see non-whites participate in a general election was in 1953. Coloured electors complying with qualifications were subsequently given four white MPs between 1958 and 1970. These seats were abolished in 1968 through the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968, enacted on behalf of Prime Minister B. J. Vorster. This removed all political representation for non-whites in South Africa; Indians had never had any parliamentary representation.
Natal Franchise.
Natal had a theoretically non-racial franchise, which was similar to (but different in detail) from the property and income based franchise of the Cape. In practice, few non-white electors ever qualified to vote under it. It was estimated, in 1908, that "200 non-Europeans out of a total of 22,786 electors had secured franchise rights".
In 1935, there was one black elector in Natal. He retained the general roll franchise when the Cape black voters lost it.
South-West Africa.
From by-elections in 1950 to 1977, six additional seats were given to members elected from South West Africa's white minority.
Tricameral Parliament.
In the Tricameral Parliament, the House of Assembly (by this time numbering 178 members) was retained as the whites-only chamber while the House of Representatives and House of Delegates were designated to Coloureds and Asians respectively.

The Grinning Man

"The Grinning Man" is a feature-length episode of the BBC crime drama series "Jonathan Creek", first broadcast on 1 January 2009. The episode marked the series' return to television following a five-year hiatus, and saw the return of Alan Davies as the show's titular sleuth. Stuart Milligan returned to the series as Jonathan's boss, magician Adam Klaus, while the episode also introduced Sheridan Smith as Joey Ross, Jonathan's crime-solving assistant. The episode was written and directed by series creator David Renwick, who chose to revive the show as a means of delaying his retirement.
The central mysteries of the episode focused on an attic room whose occupants disappeared without trace overnight, and the kidnapped partner of a stage magician.
The episode was watched by 9.91 million viewers and attained a 36% audience share. Critical reaction to the episode from "The Scotsman"'s Paul Whitelaw and "The Northern Echo"'s Steve Pratt suggested that, at 120 minutes, the plot was overstretched. "The Stage"'s Mark Wright compared Smith favourably to her predecessor in the assistant role, Julia Sawalha as Carla Borrego, while both "Scotland on Sunday"'s Chitra Ramaswamy and Sian Brewis for the "Leicester Mercury" discussed the nostalgia invoked by the episode, as a result of the series having been off-air since 2004.
Plot.
Set five years after the previous episode, "Gorgons Wood", "The Grinning Man" begins by introducing the Gothic mansion Metropolis. Since 1938, a number of visitors staying overnight in the mansion's attic "Nightmare Room" have disappeared without a trace. Originally owned by a spiritualist, the mansion is now the property of his grandson, stage magician Lance Gessler (Nicholas Boulton). Gessler lives with his mother, Constance (Judy Parfitt), his partner Elodie (Jenna Harrison), and their groundskeeper, Glenn (Ciaran McMenamin). They offer shelter to paranormal investigator Joey Ross and her friend Mina (Naomi Bentley) when the two are caught in a storm. Mina elects to sleep in the Nightmare Room, and has vanished by morning. Constance calls in sleuth Jonathan Creek to investigate Mina's disappearance. 
Jonathan has recently begun a relationship with an old acquaintance, Nicola (Katherine Parkinson), who is opposed to his investigative career, believing it to be too dangerous an occupation. Jonathan is still in the employment of the magician Adam Klaus, whose television series is receiving heavy criticism from viewers. To Jonathan's bemusement, Klaus invests in the 3D pornography industry and begins dating the porn actress Candy Mountains (Jemma Walker).
Investigating events at Metropolis, Jonathan deduces that Gessler's grandfather was a Nazi sympathizer, who laid a trap in the attic room to kill one of his enemies without arousing suspicion. Jonathan and Joey spend the night in the room, but uncover nothing, save for a small vent in the canopy of the room's four-poster bed, which is opened when pressure is put on the mattress, releasing dead flies. The next morning, Jonathan comes to the realization that the vent above the bed was designed to leak a ectoplasmic fluid onto the room's occupants as they slept, meaning they would need to bathe in the adjoining bathroom. Upon realizing the secret behind the disappearances, Jonathan races back up to the attic with Glenn. Unfortunately, Joey had already climbed into the bath, which has descended and released her into a water tank below the room, where the corpses of previous victims (including her friend Mina) remain, drowned and decomposing. The bath has not yet returned to its position so Jonathan and Glenn are able to rescue her. The mystery resembles the real-life case of the Jarmans, the sixteenth-century owners of the Ostrich Inn in Slough (Berkshire), who killed wealthy travelers by tipping them into a barrel of boiling water via a hinged bed in one of the bedrooms.
During the investigation, Gessler's partner, Elodie, is kidnapped. Joey follows Gessler from his stage show one night, and observes him slashing Elodie's throat. She, Jonathan, and Nicola later discover Elodie's dead body, but when they return with policemen, the corpse has been switched for a prop dummy. Glenn reveals that he and Elodie were in love, and had recently married in secret. He suspects that Gessler may have murdered Elodie out of jealousy after she confessed their marriage to him. The police, however, receive a video of Elodie walking through a park the morning after she was supposedly murdered, with the day's newspaper in plain view for validation. Jonathan realizes that Gessler had manipulated Delia Gunning (Ellen Ashley), the editor of the local newspaper, into printing a fake copy a week in advance. By making the video before killing Elodie, he could deflect suspicion from himself, leading the police to believe that she had faked her own death and run away. Gessler ensured the front page's authenticity by having Delia create the day's headline herself, releasing a briefcase full of bees in the middle of a local council meeting. Jonathan's suspicions became aroused as the following story about the construction of a motorway through six villages would have been far more engaging as a front-pager. Jonathan and Joey arrive at Delia's home just in time to save her from being murdered by Gessler, who later commits suicide by gassing himself in his car.
The "Grinning Man" the title refers to is the subject of a Hieronymous Bosch painting, which hangs in the attic Nightmare Room. Once the episode's mysteries are resolved, Constance confesses that she rescued the painting from a burning room decades previously, leaving an elderly uncle to die as she did so. She has Glenn assist her in burning the painting in Metropolis' grounds. The episode ends with Jonathan, Joey, and Adam arriving at a restaurant to celebrate with their significant others. Adam discovers that he has been conned by Candy, and will not be receiving any return on his pornography investment. Joey receives a call from her partner, Alec (Adam James), who reveals that he is in Miami with Nicola and the two are now seeing one another. As the maître d' (Graham Vanas) arrives to lead them to their private booth, Jonathan jests; "Three for the Nightmare Room".
Production.
David Renwick made the decision to revive "Jonathan Creek" for a Christmas special as a means of "deferring retirement". He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process, and regarded reviving "Jonathan Creek" as the "safe decision". He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an "agony" and a "torment", revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly due to a lack of ideas. Renwick explained: "Inevitably, you set up a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation, by definition it’s going to be pretty challenging stuff for a writer. So God knows why I ever embarked on it in the first place." As well as writing, Renwick also directed the episode, which was produced by Nerys Evans; "Jonathan Creek"'s former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007. Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert's death, and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive "Jonathan Creek", the broadcaster "bit his hand off for it". "The Grinning Man" was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Controller of BBC Fiction, with Lucy Lumsden, Controller of Comedy Commissioning, stating that the station was "delighted to have "Jonathan Creek" back on BBC One". Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show's revival, describing how: "People say, Oh "Jonathan Creek"'s coming back. Fantastic.' And then they watch it and go: 'God, what a mistake.' Which is what happened with "One Foot in the Grave". So I tend to expect the worst."
Davies had suspected that Renwick would one day revive "Jonathan Creek", explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - "One Foot In The Grave"'s Victor Meldrew, who was killed in a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of "The Grinning Man" was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to "Jonathan Creek" and to have something to actually solve." He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a "Jonathan Creek" episode." He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years."
Previous series of "Jonathan Creek" had featured first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin departed from the show at the end of its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was "dragging out of bed" by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to." For "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series "Love Soup", and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to "detective talk" the hardest part of the role, explaining: "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' But I learned from the master." Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: "He's [Renwick written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl."
Renwick has stated that the production of any further "Jonathan Creek" specials will depend on reception to "The Grinning Man", as well as his own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing for the first time and I think he really enjoyed it. So, we'll see."
Reception.
"The Grinning Man" received a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% share of the total television audience. The episode beat ITV's "Marple" in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. "The Sunday Times"' AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." Of the episode itself, he wrote: "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy in a way that defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." "The Herald's" Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: "it really is difficult to tell the difference between the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." While "The Scotsman"'s Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing "a slightly grumpier version" of himself, he was "quite impressed" by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was "solid" and its solution was "satisfyingly creepy", but that "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." Steve Pratt, writing for "The Northern Echo", was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot "nonsense" which "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." "The Observer"'s Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode:
Unlike McKay and Gill, however, Ferguson praised both Davies' acting and the episode as a whole, deeming it "the best thing on television all week". He opined that Davies: "plays Creek to easy perfection: mumbling, lugubrious, quietly brilliant", and called the plot "involving, intriguing, original", stating that it "did the thing all good thrillers, books or films, do of getting you actively, cleverly involved in thinking you can see the answer before anyone else. You couldn't." "The List's" Brian Donaldson was also positive about the episode, calling it "surprisingly splendid festive fare", in which "The twists and resolutions were, to this watcher at least, as well hidden as Davies’ ears underneath that shaggy bonce." "The Times"' Tim Teeman deemed the episode "comfort television", commenting on its "rambling pace" and writing that: "Our hero was brainy and cranky and the show itself awkward, funny and idiosyncratic (as you'd expect from the creator, writer and director David Renwick)." "The Daily Telegraph"' Gerard O'Donovan agreed that the episode felt "comfy and familiar", but also found its run-time overstretched, writing that it: 
Of Smith's performance as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: "For most drama series the presence of a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not "Jonathan Creek", where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for "The Stage", praised Smith's performance as Joey, deeming her to be "a much more satisfying sidekick" than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." "Scotland on Sunday"'s Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside "The Royle Family", "Blackadder" and "Shooting Stars"—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that is becoming more and more risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." Sian Brewis for the "Leicester Mercury" also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." She deemed the episode: "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the "News and Star" wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that."

BAMCEF

The All India Backward (SC, ST, OBC) And Minority Communities Employees' Federation, known as BAMCEF, is an organization of employees from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Religious Minority Communities(Muslims, Buddhist, Jain, Sikhs, etc) ) in India.
The BAMCEF association was launched in 1971 and finally became a federation in the Year 1973. Mr. Kanshiram who collaborated with colleagues Mr. D. K. Khaparde, Ram Khobragade, C.P Thorat, Namdevo Kamble, Mahonar aate and others colleagues to build the initiative. After five years rigorous fieldwork all over India, "Birth of BAMCEF Convention" was held in Delhi in 1978 and organization was then officially launched as a "Federation" on 6 December 1978 on the anniversary of the death of Dr. Babasaheb B. R. Ambedkar. the Architect of the Indian Constitution.
Manifesto.
BAMCEF's stated mission is to establish and fortify the non-political roots of the Mulnivasi Bahujan Samaj in order to change the Brahminnical Social System of Inequality (the traditional Indian social system based on castes and varna).
The organization, which celebrated its silver jubilee in 2008, upholds an ethos that states that the victims of systemic inequality in India are, naturally, the only people who can uproot the existing social structure.
History.
As an employee in the Defence Research and Development Laboratory in Pune, Kanshiram realized that the formation of a bahujan bureaucracy was important if dalits' interests were to be served. He set about forming a federation, through which he worked his way into the higher echelons of bureaucracy. By identifying a few zealous officers he was able to influence lower staff.
The motto of the organization was "Pay back to society", to inspire the dalit bureaucrats to do their bit for the dalit masses. In this way, a continuous supply of intellect, money, and talent was ensured. Kanshiram did not want to make the BAMCEF merely an employees' union. Rather, he wanted it to become the organisation of educated "bahujan" employees: "the think tank, talent bank, and financial bank of the "bahujan samaj"".
BAMCEF raised funds to promote their agenda and for training. Kanshi Ram appointed state-level conveners as well as mandal conveners to act as links between state and district levels.
Knowing the limitations of BAMCEF, The Dalith Soshit Samaj Sangharsh samithi (DS4) had been formed in 1981. This organisation made impact on people in North as well as South India. Before formation of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)the DS4 entered in local elections in Delhi and Haryana in the name of "Limited Political Action". Later on Kanshiram dissolved the DS4 and formed a completely political wing Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). This caused strain within the ranks of the BAMCEF.
In early 1986, BAMCEF split. Kanshiram announced that he was no longer willing to work for any organisation other than the BSP. In 1987, without Kanshiram, D.K. Khaparde, T.S. Zalli, L.S. Sonkamble, together with other colleagues, registered BAMCEF. Since then, one element of BAMCEF, which was associated with Kanshi Ram, has been converted into a shadow organization to help the BSP in electoral mobilization. Those remaining in BAMCEF, after Kanshiram's departure, registered as an independent mulnivasi bahujan's organisation.

Birmingham–Southern Panthers football

The Birmingham–Southern Panthers football team represents Birmingham–Southern College (BSC) in the NCAA Division III, competing as part of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. BSC plays its home games at the 1,600 seat Panther Stadium, which is located on-campus in Birmingham, Alabama and opened in November 2008. Although only fielding a team since the 2007 season, Birmingham–Southern previously fielded a team from the 1918 season that was later disbanded following the 1939 season.
History.
Prior to the consolidation of Southern University and Birmingham College, each fielded football squads. Between 1904 to 1917, Birmingham College compiled a 19–32–4 record, and between 1909 to 1916 Southern University compiled a 3–16–11 record. Following the consolidation of the schools as Birmingham–Southern, the program compiled an overall record of 87–80–16 between 1918–39, winning Dixie Conference championships in 1932, 1934, and 1937.
During this period, the Panthers played their home games at the Munger Bowl, which was located on-campus and subsequently demolished in the 1960s to make way for campus expansion. Additionally, Howard College, now Samford University, was BSC's biggest rival with the annual contest being called the Magic City Classic and played in Rickwood Field before serving as the opening contest at Legion Field in 1929. Following the 1939 season, football was disbanded with the school citing its overall costs and influence on the school.
After a nearly 70 year hiatus, on May 26, 2006, the board of trustees that Birmingham–Southern would field a Division III football team to begin competition for the 2007 season. By the following June, Joey Jones was announced as the programs head coach, and on September 6, 2007, the Panthers defeated the Mississippi College junior varsity 41–13 at Legion Field for the first victory of the revived program. After a 3–7 first season, Jones would leave BSC to become the first head coach at South Alabama, and in February 2008 Eddie Garfinkle was announced as the Panthers head coach.

Jorge Merced

Jorge B. Merced (born 1965) is a New York-based Puerto Rican actor, theatre director, and gay activist. He is associate artistic director of Pregones Theater, a bilingual (Spanish/English) Puerto Rican/Latino theater company located near Hostos Community College in the Bronx, New York City. He is best known for his role as Loca la de la locura Queen of Madness in Pregones’s play "El bolero fue mi ruina" Bolero Was My Downfall.
Life.
Merced was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico, and came to the United States as an adult in 1982. He started out as a dancer in college and went on to receive an undergraduate degree from the City College of New York (CUNY) Theatre Department, also studying at the Escuela Internacional de Teatro de América Latina y el Caribe (EITALC) School of Latin American and Caribbean Theatre in Cuba and at the Alvin Ailey School in New York. Merced is fully bilingual in English and Spanish and performs in both languages. He has trained, performed, and directed throughout the U.S. and abroad in Brazil, Chile, Cuba, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, and Spain. Merced is openly gay and has spoken about how his personal experiences in Puerto Rico and New York have been profoundly marked by his sexuality.
Work.
Merced's numerous professional credits include acting in and directing more than 50 theatrical productions including "El bolero fue mi ruina" (actor), "El apagón/The Blackout" (actor), "Baile Cangrejero" (actor), "Blanco" (director), "El huésped vacío" (director), and "Brides". Creative collaborations in both dance and theater include premieres with Eduardo Alegría, Pablo Cabrera, Antonio Martorell, and Arthur Aviles.
Merced's commitment to AIDS prevention led him to spearhead Pregones's "El abrazo/The Embrace" from 1987 to 1993. This AIDS community education project was based on the theories of Augusto Boal and has been carefully analyzed by the Puerto Rican scholar and actress Eva C. Vásquez in her book "Pregones Theatre" (2003), which includes an interview with Merced.
In 2002, Merced created the Asunción Playwrights Project as a way to "showcase the work of Latino playwrights exploring issues of difference and transformation at the limits of queer identity." The project includes a play competition, public readings of up to four plays (followed by discussions with the audience), and workshop productions of the winning play. Winning playwrights have included Gonzalo Aburto (2003), Ricardo Bracho and Pablo García Gámez (2004), Charles Rice-González (2005), Chuy Sanchez (2006), and Aravind Adyanthaya (2007).
Merced's performance in Pregones’s play "El bolero fue mi ruina" Bolero Was My Downfall (1997–2002, restaged 2005) has received significant critical reception.

Julia Brystiger

Julia Brystiger (née Prajs, born November 25, 1902, in Stryj – died November 9, 1975, in Warsaw) was a Polish Communist activist and member of the security apparatus in Stalinist Poland. She was also known as "Julia Brystygier", "Bristiger", "Brustiger", "Briestiger", "Brystygierowa", "Bristigierowa", and by her nicknames – given by the victims of torture: "Luna", "Bloody Luna", "Daria", "Ksenia", and "Maria". The nickname "Bloody Luna" was a direct reference of her Gestapo-like methods during interrogations. Her pen name was "Julia Preiss". 
Brystiger was the daughter of a Jewish pharmacist from Stryj (now Ukraine). In 1920 she graduated from high school in Lwów (new Second Polish Republic) and married a Zionist activist Natan (Nathan) Brystiger. She studied history at the Lwów University while pregnant and a year later gave birth to a son, Michał Bristiger. 
After graduating from University, Brystiger went to Paris where she continued her education, receiving a PhD in philosophy. Upon their return, in 1928–1929, she got a job at a high school in Wilno and in a Jewish Teacher's College "Tarbuch". Since 1927, she was an active participant in the communist movement, and in 1929 was fired because of her communist agitation. Working for the Communist Party of Poland, she was arrested several times, and in 1937 was sentenced to 2 years in prison.
Stalinist agent.
After the Nazi and Soviet attack on Poland, Brystiger escaped to Samarkand, accepted Soviet citizenship and became an active member of the Soviet political administration. She created the so-called "Committee of Political Prisoners", which helped the NKVD to imprison several members of the prewar Polish opposition movements. She was "denouncing people on such scale, that she antagonized even Communist party members". Ironically, at one point Brystiger oversaw the interrogation and persecution of Bela and Józef Goldberg – her future colleague, the UB interrogator known as Józef Różański. Różańskis had committed "a crime" of accepting Western food-aid in the form of two kilograms of rice and a bag of flour from the Polish Government in Exile's embassy, in order to save their daughter from starvation. A few years later, Józef Różański joined the NKVD and eventually, became a high ranking functionary in the Polish secret police. He ended up working alongside Brystiger – his former interrogator – in the Ministry of Public Security of Poland under Stalinism.
Following German Operation Barbarossa Brystiger fled to Kharkov, then to Samarkand deep in the USSR. In 1943-44, she worked for the Union of Polish Patriots, and in October 1944, joined the new Polish Workers' Party. In December 1944, after returning behind the Soviet front, Brystygier began working for the infamous Ministry of Public Security of Poland, where she soon got promoted to the rank of Director of the Fifth Department created in July 1946 specifically for the purpose of persecution and torture of Polish religious personalities. Her career is believed to have been so rapid also because she was intimate with such high functionaries as Jakub Berman and Hilary Minc. In the Polish official archives, there is an instruction written by Brystygier to her subordinates, about the purpose of torture: 
Brystiger personally oversaw the first stages of each UB investigation at her place of employment. She would torture the captured persons using her own methods such as whipping male victims' genitals. One of her victims was a man named Szafarzynski – from the Olsztyn office of the Polish People's Party – who died as a result of interrogation carried out by Brystygier. One of the victims of her interrogation methods testified later: "She is a murderous monster, worse than German female guards of the concentration camps". Anna Roszkiewicz–Litwiniwiczowa, a former soldier of the Home Army, said about Brystygier: "She was famous for her sadistic tortures; she seemed to have been obsessed with sadistic treatment of genitalia and was fulfilling her libido in that way.". 
Brystiger became the head of the 5th Department of MBP sometime in the late 1940s. It specialized in the persecution of Polish religious leaders. Brystygier – a dogmatic Marxist – yearned to destroy all religion as an "opiate of the masses". She directed the operation to arrest and detain the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski. The decision to arrest him had been made earlier in Moscow. Brystygier took an active part in the "war against religion" in the 1950s, in which only in 1950 (in one year), 123 Roman Catholic priests were imprisoned. She also persecuted other congregations, such as the 2,000 jailed Jehovah's Witnesses. Julia Brystygier left the Ministry of Public Security in 1956 and tried to become a writer, authoring a novel "Crooked Letters". She worked in a publishing house under Jewish communist Jerzy Borejsza (Różański's brother), and was a frequent visitor in a boarding school for vision impaired, in a village near Warsaw. In 1975, at the age of 73, she asked for baptism and converted to Catholicism. She died the same year.
