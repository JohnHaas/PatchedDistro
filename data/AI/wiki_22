SIAI S.13

__NOTOC__
The SIAI S.13 was an Italian 1910s reconnaissance flying-boat. 
Design and development.
Designed by the Società Idrovolanti Alta Italia (SIAI) as a smaller version of the earlier S.12, the S.13 was a single-engined biplane reconnaissance-fighter flying boat. It had a crew of two in side-by-side seats behind a single windscreen; the observer has a single trainably-mounted machine-gun. The flying boat was powered by a single 250 hp (187 kW) Isotta Fraschini V6 engine. 
The Royal Italian Navy took delivery of 12 aircraft in 1919 and the flying boat was exported to Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Yugoslavia. In France the S.13 was built under license as the CAMS C-13 and the Spanish naval workshops in Barcelona also built seven under licence.
A single-seat version, the S.13 Tipo, was ordered by the Royal Italian Navy, but was later cancelled when the Royal Navy decided to develop the Macchi M.7 instead and a civilian version, the S.13"bis", failed to attract any orders.

Fitzwatertown, Pennsylvania

Fitzwatertown is an unincorporated community located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The community is in Upper Dublin Township, south of Jarrettown, west of Abington, northeast of Oreland and approximately north of Philadelphia.
Fitzwatertown is located at the intersection of Limekiln Pike, Fitzwatertown Road and Jenkintown Road.
Bean's 1884 "History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania" describes Fitzwatertown as follows:
Fitzwatertown is situated in the southern part of the township, on the Limekiln turnpike, in the midst of the fertile valley of Sandy Run, abounding in limestone and iron-ore. This is an old settlement where Thomas Fitzwater followed lime-burning before the summer of 1705 and had a grist-mill erected at an early period. It contains a store hotel, wheel-wright and blacksmith-shop, grist-mill and about twelve house. The post-office was established here before 1858. The value of lime produced in Upper Dublin for 1840 was stated to be twenty thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars, which was all produced in this vicinity, but the business has since been greatly increased through railroad facilities. Edge Hill Station, of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, is only a mile distant; yet, with all its surpassing advantages, as may be observed, has made but very little progress for the last half-century. The grist-mill mentioned was long carried on by John Price and is now, owned by Samuel Conard. Sandy Run is a steady stream rising at the Moreland line, about three miles distant.

Drama

Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning "action" (Classical Greek: , "drama"), which is derived from the verb meaning "to do" or "to act" (Classical Greek: , "draō"). The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The early modern tragedy "Hamlet" (1601) by Shakespeare and the classical Athenian tragedy "Oedipus the King" (c. 429 BC) by Sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama. A modern example is "Long Day's Journey into Night" by Eugene O’Neill (1956).
The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's "Poetics" (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.
The use of "drama" in the narrow sense to designate a specific "type" of play dates from the 19th century. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is "neither" a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's "Thérèse Raquin" (1873) or Chekhov's "Ivanov" (1887). It is this narrow sense that the film and television industry and film studies adopted to describe "drama" as a genre within their respective media. "Radio drama" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.
Drama is often combined with music and dance: the drama in opera is generally sung throughout; musicals generally include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). In certain periods of history (the ancient Roman and modern Romantic) some dramas have been written to be read rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.
History of Western drama.
Classical Greek drama.
Western drama originates in classical Greece. The theatrical culture of the city-state of Athens produced three genres of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were institutionalised in competitions held as part of festivities celebrating the god Dionysus. Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least Thespis, who is credited with the innovation of an actor (""hypokrites"") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a character (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the chorus and its leader (""coryphaeus""), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry (dithyrambic, lyric and epic). 
Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and the comic writers Aristophanes and, from the late 4th century, Menander. Aeschylus' historical tragedy "The Persians" is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the City Dionysia competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years. The competition (""agon"") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (""didaskaliai"") begin from 501 BC, when the satyr play was introduced. Tragic dramatists were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' "Alcestis" in 438 BC). Comedy was officially recognised with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC. 
Five comic dramatists competed at the City Dionysia (though during the Peloponnesian War this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy. Ancient Greek comedy is traditionally divided between "old comedy" (5th century BC), "middle comedy" (4th century BC) and "new comedy" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).
Classical Roman drama.
Following the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered Greek drama. From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it. 
While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments. The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama. No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both genres, Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama. 
By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers ("collegium poetarum") had been formed. The Roman comedies that have survived are all "fabula palliata" (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence). In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence). The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping. 
Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his farces are best known; he was admired for the wit of his dialogue and his use of a variety of poetic meters. All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour. No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius. 
From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are "fabula crepidata" (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his "Phaedra", for example, was based on Euripides' "Hippolytus". Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the "fabula praetexta" (tragedies based on Roman subjects), "Octavia", but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.
Medieval.
In the Middle Ages, drama in the vernacular languages of Europe may have emerged from religious enactments of the liturgy. Mystery plays were presented on the porch of the cathedrals or by strolling players on feast days. Miracle and mystery plays, along with moralities and interludes, later evolved into more elaborate forms of drama, such as was seen on the Elizabethan stages.
Elizabethan and Jacobean.
One of the great flowerings of drama in England occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly iambic pentameter. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, and Ben Jonson were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the medieval period, historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the Tudor monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from Greek mythology and Roman mythology or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as Plautus and Terence.lala
Modern and postmodern.
The pivotal and innovative contributions of the 19th-century Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the 20th-century German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era. The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both modernist and realist, incorporating formal experimentation, meta-theatricality, and social critique. In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of "liberal tragedy", while Brecht's has been aligned with an historicised comedy.
Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, Frank Wedekind, Maurice Maeterlinck, Federico García Lorca, Eugene O'Neill, Luigi Pirandello, George Bernard Shaw, Ernst Toller, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Dario Fo, Heiner Müller, and Caryl Churchill.
Asian drama.
India.
The earliest form of Indian drama was the Sanskrit drama that is said to have its framework directly given by Lord Shiva who used these techniques to pray to Lord Vishnu. Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of modern plays were written. With the Islamic conquests that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely. Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Modern Indian theatre developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.
Sanskrit theatre.
The earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century AD. The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre. The ancient "Vedas" (hymns from between 1500 to 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of literature in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of dialogue) and the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The "Mahābhāṣya" by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama. This treatise on grammar from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.
The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is "A Treatise on Theatre" ("Nātyaśāstra"), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The "Treatise" is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre.
Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature. It utilised stock characters, such as the hero ("nayaka"), heroine ("nayika"), or clown ("vidusaka"). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include Bhasa, Kalidasa (famous for "Vikrama and Urvashi", "Malavika and Agnimitra", and "The Recognition of Shakuntala"), Śudraka (famous for "The Little Clay Cart"), Asvaghosa, Daṇḍin, and Emperor Harsha (famous for "Nagananda", "Ratnavali" and "Priyadarsika"). "Śakuntalā" (in English translation) influenced Goethe's "Faust" (1808–1832).
Modern Indian drama.
Rabindranath Tagore, was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed . His plays are written in Bengali and include "Chitra" ("Chitrangada", 1892), "The King of the Dark Chamber" ("Raja", 1910), "The Post Office" ("Dakghar", 1913), and "Red Oleander" ("Raktakarabi", 1924).
Girish Karnad is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as Tughlaq, Hayavadana, Taledanda and Naga-Mandala are significant contributions to Indian drama.
Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan.
Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of Awadh. His dramatic experiments led to the famous Inder Sabha of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.
In some way or other, Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern Indian theatre. Among all the languages Urdu (which was called Hindi by early writers), along with Gujrati, Marathi and Bengali theatres have kept flourishing and demand for its writers and artists has not subsided by the drama aficionados. For Urdu drama, no place is better than Bombay Film industry otherwise known as Hindi film industry. All the early gems of Urdu Theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu Dramatic tradition has been a spectator’s delight since 100 years and counting.
Drama as a theme is made up of several elements. It focuses on life and different aspects of it. The thing to be noticed here is that drama on stage imitates drama in life. It has been said that, there has always been a mutual relationship between theatre and real life. Great historical personalities like Shakespeare have influenced Modern Urdu tradition to a large extent when Indian, Iranian, Turkish stories and folk was adapted for stage with heavy doses of Urdu poetry. In modern times writers like Imtiaz Ali Taj, Rafi Peer, Krishan Chander, Manto, Upender Nath Ashk, Ghulam Rabbani, Prof. Mujeeb and many others shaped this tradition.
While Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few postmodern playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.
Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for Plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other gems which are regularly staged for massive turn out of theatre lovers. Maulana Azad is his magnum opus both for its content and style.
Danish Iqbal's play about 'Dara Shikoh' directed by M. S. Sathyu is considered a modern classic for the use of newer theatre techniques and contemporary perspective. His other plays are 'Sahir' on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. 'Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam' is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of the Faiz's poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. 'Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan' - another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy days. He has written 14 other plays including 'Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa' and 'Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon'. Shahid's 'Three B' is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of vigorous performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of Mumbai has written several plays in Urdu, his play "AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?" won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.
China.
Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called Chinese opera although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as Beijing opera and Kunqu; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as zaju.
Japan.
Japanese Nō drama is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.
Kyōgen is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. Kabuki drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.
Forms of drama.
Opera.
Western opera is a dramatic art form, which arose during the Renaissance in an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama tradition in which both music and theatre were combined. Being strongly intertwined with western classical music, the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the huge influence of the German 19th-century composer Richard Wagner on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the traditional Greek drama, he entirely renewed the operatic format, and to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in these new works, he called them "music dramas".
Chinese opera has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.
Pantomime.
These stories follow in the tradition of fables and folk tales. Usually there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses stock characters seen in masque and again commedia dell'arte, these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on moral dilemmas, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.
Creative drama.
Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. Winifred Ward is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois .

Theatre

Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe").
Modern Western theatre derives in large measure from ancient Greek drama, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre scholar Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing, and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature, and the arts in general.
Theatre today, broadly defined, includes performances of plays and musicals, ballets, operas and various other forms.
History.
Classical and Hellenistic Greece.
The city-state of Athens is where western theatre originated. It was part of a broader culture of theatricality and performance in classical Greece that included festivals, religious rituals, politics, law, athletics and gymnastics, music, poetry, weddings, funerals, and "symposia". Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and attendance at the City Dionysia as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of citizenship. Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the rhetoric of orators evidenced in performances in the law-court or political assembly, both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary. The Greeks also developed the concepts of dramatic criticism, acting as a career, and theatre architecture. The theatre of ancient Greece consisted of three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play.
The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus.The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.
Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state. Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period. No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was institution alised in competitions ("agon") held as part of festivities celebrating Dionysos (the god of wine and fertility). As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play. The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records ("didaskaliai") begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced. Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from Greek mythology, though "The Persians"—which stages the Persian response to news of their military defeat at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama. When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive. More than 130 years later, the philosopher Aristotle analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of dramatic theory—his "Poetics" (c. 335 BCE).
Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of Menander. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster.
Roman theatre.
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The Roman historian Livy wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by Etruscan actors. Beacham argues that they had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of Plautus's broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of Seneca. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the Hellenization of Roman culture in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving Roman tragedies, indeed the only plays of any kind from the Roman Empire, are ten dramas- nine of them pallilara- attributed to Lucuis Annaeus Seneca (4 b.c.-65 a.d.), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero.
Post-classical theatre in the West.
Theatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including "commedia dell'arte" and melodrama. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the Renaissance and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the Industrial Revolution. 
Theatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of Cromwell's Interregnum. Theatre was seen as something sinful and the Puritans tried very hard to drive it out of their society. Because of this stagnant period, once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the Restoration, theatre (among other arts) exploded because of a lot of influence from France, where Charles was in exile the years previous to his reign.
One of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the types in the Elizabethan era that were like the Globe Theatre, round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no "theater manners,” it transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and somewhat stadium seating in front of it. This way, seating was more prioritized because some seats were obviously better than others because the seating was no longer all the way around the stage. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery.
Because of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. Jeremy Collier, a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece "A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage". The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage effects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today.
The eighteenth century also introduced women to the stage, which was viewed as inappropriate before. These women were looked at as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to some ideas on individualism that were beginning to be born in Renaissance Humanism) but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage and some said they were unladylike and looked down on. Charless II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts. Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists like dressing them up as men and narrow escapes of morally sticky situations as forms of comedy.
Comedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like Sheridan's "The School for Scandal". Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. Molière was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Commedia dell'arte, French comedy and satire to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies. Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration to the Crown. They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called tragedie bourgeoise, the tragedy of common life, were more popular in England because they applied more to the English sensibilities.
Through the 19th century, the popular theatrical forms of Romanticism, melodrama, Victorian burlesque and the well-made plays of Scribe and Sardou gave way to the problem plays of Naturalism and Realism; the farces of Feydeau; Wagner's operatic "Gesamtkunstwerk"; musical theatre (including Gilbert and Sullivan's operas); F. C. Burnand's, W. S. Gilbert's and Wilde's drawing-room comedies; Symbolism; proto-Expressionism in the late works of August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen; and Edwardian musical comedy.
These trends continued through the 20th century in the realism of Stanislavski and Lee Strasberg, the political theatre of Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht, the so-called Theatre of the Absurd of Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco, American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, experimental and postmodern theatre of Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage, the postcolonial theatre of August Wilson or Tomson Highway, and Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed.
Eastern theatrical traditions.
The first form of Indian theatre was the Sanskrit theatre. It began after the development of Greek and Roman theatre and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia. It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written. Japanese forms of Kabuki, Nō, and Kyōgen developed in the 17th century CE. Theatre in the medieval Islamic world included puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as "ta'ziya", where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the "shaheed" (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Secular plays were known as "akhraja", recorded in medieval "adab" literature, though they were less common than puppetry and "ta'ziya" theatre.
Types.
Drama.
Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning "action", which is derived from the verb δράω, "dráō", "to do" or "to act". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The early modern tragedy "Hamlet" (1601) by Shakespeare and the classical Athenian tragedy "Oedipus the King" (c. 429 BCE) by Sophocles are among the masterpieces of the art of drama. A modern example is "Long Day's Journey into Night" by Eugene O'Neill (1956).
Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's "Poetics" (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of dramatic theory. The use of "drama" in the narrow sense to designate a specific "type" of play dates from the 19th century. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is "neither" a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's "Thérèse Raquin" (1873) or Chekhov's "Ivanov" (1887). In Ancient Greece however, the word "drama" encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between.
Drama is often combined with music and dance: the drama in opera is generally sung throughout; musicals generally include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). In certain periods of history (the ancient Roman and modern Romantic) some dramas have been written to be read rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.
Musical theatre.
Music and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—Athenian tragedy, for example, was a form of dance-drama that employed a chorus whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an "aulos"—an instrument comparable to the modern clarinet), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' (monodies). Modern musical theatre is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from comic opera (especially Gilbert and Sullivan), variety, vaudeville, and music hall genres of the late 19th and early 20th century. After the Edwardian musical comedy that began in the 1890s, the Princess Theatre musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of Rodgers and Hammerstein), with "Oklahoma!" (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction. Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included "My Fair Lady" (1956), "West Side Story" (1957), "The Fantasticks" (1960), "Hair" (1967), "A Chorus Line" (1975), "Les Misérables" (1980) and "The Phantom of the Opera" (1986), as well as more contemporary hits including "Rent" (1994), "The Lion King" (1997) and "Wicked" (2003).
Musical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale Off-Broadway, in regional theatres, and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, Broadway and West End musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multi-million dollar budgets.
Comedy.
Theatre productions that use humour as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern farce such as "Boeing Boeing" or a classical play such as "As You Like It". Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as black comedy.
Tragedy.
Aristotle's phrase "several kinds being found in separate parts of the play" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the Attic dialect whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the Doric dialect, these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and poetic metres of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical "drama".
Tragedy refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation. That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity—"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity," as Raymond Williams puts it. From its obscure origins in the theatres of Athens 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Racine, and Schiller, to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of Strindberg, Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering, and Müller's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change. In the wake of Aristotle's "Poetics" (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre.
Improvisation.
Improvisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner Dario Fo and troupes such as the Upright Citizens Brigade improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. Keith Johnstone and Viola Spolin are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and the American Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy.
Theories of theatre.
Having been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different theories and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on "artistic" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The classical Greek philosopher Aristotle's "Poetics" (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since. In it, he offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes drama—comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play—as well as lyric poetry, epic poetry, and the dithyramb). He examines its "first principles" and identifies its genres and basic elements; his analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion. He argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) "mythos" or "plot", "ethos" or "character", "dianoia" or "thought", "lexis" or "diction", "melos" or "song", and "opsis" or "spectacle". "Although Aristotle's "Poetics" is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition," Marvin Carlson explains, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions." Important theatre practitioners of the 20th century include Konstantin Stanislavski, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Jacques Copeau, Edward Gordon Craig, Bertolt Brecht, Antonin Artaud, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, Augusto Boal, Eugenio Barba, Dario Fo, Keith Johnstone and Robert Wilson (director).
Stanislavski treated the theatre as an art-form that is autonomous from literature and one in which the playwright's contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists. His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream western performance training for much of the last century. That many of the precepts of his system of actor training seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success. Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so. Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States. Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American Method, although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and psychophysical approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum.
Technical aspects of theatre.
Theatre presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. The production of plays usually involves contributions from a playwright, director, a cast of actors, and a technical production team that includes a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer, sound designer, stage manager, and production manager. Depending on the production, this team may also include a composer, dramaturg, video designer or fight director.
Stagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.
In its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition.
The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.
Theatre organization and administration.
There are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways.
Theatrical enterprise varies enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from professionals to hobbyists to spontaneous novices. Theatre can be performed with no money at all or on a grand scale with multi-million dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include:
Repertory companies.
While most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set "run", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, repertory companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The Royal National Theatre in London performs on a repertory system.
Repertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction.
Producing vs. presenting.
In order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a theatre venue are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, do not have their own theatre venue. These companies perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage.
Some performance groups perform in non-theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include street theatre, and site-specific theatre. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.
A touring company is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city.
Unions.
There are many theatre unions including Actors' Equity Association (for actors and stage managers), the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society (SDC), and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.

2009 Guwahati bombings

The 2009 Guwahati bombings occurred on 1 January 2009 in Guwahati, Assam, India. They occurred a few hours before Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram was due to travel to the city.
The bombing was carried put by the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), and left 6 people dead and a further 67 injured.
Details.
Police confirmed that first blast took place near Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi TB Hospital at Birubari at 2.35pm, injuring five people, including a 10-year-old child. Another blast at the busy Bhootnath market near the famous Kamakhya Temple, killed two people instaneously and injured at least 25 others. Police said that a bomb was placed on a bicycle. Incidentally, P Chidambaram was to pass Bhootnath on his way from the airport.
The third blast occurred outside a Big Bazaar retail outlet at Bhangagarh, a commercial area near Guwahati Medical College (GMCH), at 5.45 pm. Bhangagarh is one of the poshest areas in Guwahati and is home to many shopping malls. Three of the 34 people injured in the blast succumbed to their injuries in hospital. Police suspected that the bomb was kept inside a pan shop in the area. Another person died in the hospital making the death toll 6.
All three blasts were low intensity, carried using Improvised explosive devices (IED). Police say that the a biker placed the first bomb in a dustbin, the second one was placed on a cycle and third on the roadside. The second blast was the most powerful one. The third blast ignited a fire due to its proximity to a kerosene source.
The injured were admitted to the GMCH and Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital (MMCH) and are reported to be in critical condition.
Investigation.
The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) is suspected of having carried out the bombings. Some army officials suspected the hand of Bangladesh-based fundamentalist groups, who could have slipped in Assam and other northeastern states fearing action by the newly elected government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed.
Reactions.
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi admitted security lapses and expressed the need of strengthening the state police force.

Nizar Rayan

Nizar Rayan (, ; also transliterated Rayyan) (6 March 1959–1 January 2009) was a top Hamas leader who served as a liaison between the Palestinian organization's political leadership and its military wing. Also a professor of Islamic law, he became a top clerical authority within Hamas after the death of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004. Rayan was a strong advocate between 1994 and 2004 or 2005 of suicide attacks on Israel, and his son killed himself on one such mission. Rayan and most of his family were killed in an Israeli airstrike during the Gaza War.
Personal life and background.
Rayan was born in Jabalia, Gaza Strip on 6 March 1959. In 1982, he received a bachelor of arts degree in religious principles from Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While there he was influenced by Wahhabism. He then attended the University of Jordan in Amman and in 1990 received a masters degree with honors. In 1994, Rayan completed his PhD in Islamic studies at the Omdurman Islamic University in Omdurman, Sudan. His dissertation has the title of "Future of Islam: Objective Analysis".
After his studies, Rayan returned to Gaza and was employed as a preacher at several local mosques, Jabalia's Imad Aqil Mosque (also known as the "Mosque of martyrs") among them. He later became a professor of Islamic law at the Islamic University of Gaza. Rayan was a leading authority on Hadith (sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), and he amassed a 5,000-book library in his home. An Israeli intelligence source describes Rayan as a strong opponent of Shia Islam, who opposed allowing the Shia branch of Islam to establish a foothold in Palestinian territories.
Eventually, according to the "The Jerusalem Post", Rayan became an important leader in Hamas, in particular a spiritual leader of Hamas's military wing, and he regularly went on patrol with Hamas militia after delivering lectures at the Islamic University. He arguably became Hamas's leading clerical authority after an Israeli airstrike killed Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004.
Rayan and Hamas began to strongly advocate for suicide bombing attacks to be carried out against Israel in 1994. According to Chris Hedges who interviewed him, Rayan constantly recalled that Hamas, "began to target Israeli civilians in 1994 only after Palestinian worshipers were gunned down in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein."
In 2001, with Rayan's backing his 22-year-old son went on a suicide bombing mission in which he died and killed two Israelis at the former Israeli settlement Elei Sinai in the Gaza Strip. Rayan is alleged to have directed the 2004 Ashdod Port attack which killed ten people. Hamas ceased its suicide attacks against Israel in 2005, but Rayan advocated for their renewal after the 2008-2009 Gaza conflict began.
Rayan was one of the principal architects of the 2007 Battle of Gaza, in which Fatah security forces were routed and between 116 and 400 Fatah and Hamas fighters and civilians lost their lives. Both Hamas and Fatah were accused of atrocities, including torture, during that conflict. According to "The Jerusalem Post", Rayan, "boasted that the Strip had been 'cleansed' of 'traitors' and 'CIA agents' - a reference to Abbas and his former security chiefs." According to a Hamas spokesperson, it is possible the Fatah-dominated Palestinian National Authority asked Israel to kill Rayan due to his role in the Hamas-Fatah clashes. He added that Rayan was one of the main reasons why many of Mahmoud Abbas's men "did not sleep well at night."
Rayan was fundamentally opposed to the state of Israel. According to writer Jeffrey Goldberg, he at one time stated, "True Islam would never allow a Jewish state to survive in the Muslim Middle East. Israel is an impossibility. It is an offense against God." Goldberg also reported that Rayan said he believed Jews are a "cursed people" some of whom were transformed into pigs and apes by Allah, and that Jews must pay for murdering the prophets of Islam and "closing ears to the Messenger of Allah."
Rayan married four women with whom he had twelve children.
Islamization of the Gaza Strip.
Following the 2007 takeover of Gaza, Rayan said that "In a few hours, the secular era in Gaza will end without leaving a trace... Today heresy ends. Today the struggle is between Islam and the infidels, and it will end with the victory of the faith." He added that he will transform the PA security forces headquarters in Gaza to a mosque. Following the speech, Fatah members expressed fear that Hamas would transform Gaza into a Taliban-style Islamic emirate with Iranian and Syrian support.
Israeli attack.
Rayan was killed in an Israeli Air Force strike on 1 January 2009 during the Gaza War. The day before the attack, Rayan had advocated renewal of suicide attacks on Israel, declaring, "Our only language with the Jew is through the gun". A 2,000-pound bomb was dropped on his house by an Israeli F-16 fighter jet, also killing his 4 wives (Hiam 'Abdul Rahman Rayan, 46; Iman Khalil Rayan, 46; Nawal Isma'il Rayan, 40; and Sherine Sa'id Rayan, 25) and 11 of their children (As'ad, 2; Usama Ibn Zaid, 3; 'Aisha, 3; Reem, 4; Miriam, 5; Halima, 5; 'Abdul Rahman, 6; Abdul Qader, 12; Aaya, 12; Zainab, 15; and Ghassan, 16).
Unlike other Hamas leaders at risk of being targeted by Israel, Rayan did not go underground after the armed conflict with Israel began in late December 2008. According to a Hamas spokesperson and Rayyan's son, the IDF warned Rayan by contacting his cell phone that an attack on his house was imminent. An Israeli military spokesperson interviewed by "The International Herald Tribune" "could not give details or specify whether Rayyan's family had been warned."
Israeli security sources stated that Rayan's house, at the time of the attack, was an arms warehouse and government communications center, and contained a tunnel opening. The sources also stated that a weapons stockpile in the house triggered many secondary explosions immediately after the missile attack. The "New York Daily News" commented that Rayan had "sacrificed his children - in a vain attempt to protect a weapons cache beneath his home." Israeli security forces legal officials regard striking homes used for weapons storage, when sufficient warning is given to the residents, as falling within the boundaries of international law and a legitimate act of war. However, according to B'Tselem (The Israeli Center for Human Rights Information in the Occupied Territories), even if the Israeli charge that Rayan's house was a munitions warehouse were true, the large number of civilian lives taken rendered the attack "a grave breach of international humanitarian law." The Israeli NGO added that, given the Israeli military "knew or should have known" that civilians had not left Rayan's house, warning Rayan of the impending attack did not exempt Israeli forces from responsibility for the civilian deaths. According to the Israeli Government report published in July 2009, Nizar Rayan was not the target of the attack; instead, the operational goal of the strike was to destroy Hamas’ central compound which included several buildings that served as storage sites for weapons. The report further states that specific phone calls to the residents of the targeted buildings were made, as well as two rounds of preliminary warning shots, 13 minutes and 9 minutes before the strike, were fired; a group of the residents leaving the building were seen by IDF surveillance, leading to a reasonable conclusion that the buildings were empty. The IDF suggests that in this case laws of armed conflict were not violated, as the strike was directed at proper military objective and at-risk civilians were issued effective advance warnings.
Rayan was the most senior Hamas member killed since Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi was killed in Israeli airstrikes in 2004. Hamas said that Israel would pay a "heavy price" for his death.

Zogam

Zogam (or Chinland, the political appellation mainly used to describe the envisioned unified and separate democratic nation-state) is the name for a territory, approximately in size, in Burma, India and Bangladesh. It is the traditional home of the Zomi, who lived in this area before the colonial period under British rulership.
It does not include Asho settlements in Lower Burma and Masho settlements in the Arakan (Burma). The area extends from latitude 25° 30’ North in the Somra tracts facing Mount Saramati, and in Nagaland across the Namtakik River and the North Cachar Hills, to about 20° 30’ North Latitude. The longitudinal extension is between 92° 10’ East and 94° 20’ east. The North-South length of the Zoram is roughly 350 miles (560 km) and East-West is generally about 120 miles (190 km) wide.

<doc id="20913864" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913864" title="Female">
Female

Female (♀) is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, which produces non-mobile ova (egg cells). Most female mammals, including female humans, have two X chromosomes.
Defining characteristics.
The ova are defined as the larger gametes in a heterogamous reproduction system, while the smaller, usually motile gamete, the spermatozoon, is produced by the male. A female individual cannot reproduce sexually without access to the gametes of a male (an exception is parthenogenesis). Some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually.
There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages. Patterns of sexual reproduction include
Other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced, differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another. The concept is not limited to animals; egg cells are produced by chytrids, diatoms, water moulds and land plants, among others. In land plants, "female" and "male" designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures, but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants.
Etymology and usage.
The word female comes from the Latin "femella", the diminutive form of "femina", meaning "woman". It is not etymologically related to the word "male", but in the late 14th century the spelling was altered in English to parallel the spelling of "male". 
Mammalian female.
A distinguishing characteristic of the class "Mammalia" is the presence of mammary glands. The mammary glands are modified sweat glands that produce milk, which is used to feed the young for some time after birth. Only mammals produce milk. Mammary glands are most obvious in humans, as the female human body stores large amounts of fatty tissue near the nipples, resulting in prominent breasts. Mammary glands are present in all mammals, although they are vestigial in the male of the species.
Most mammalian females have two copies of the X chromosome as opposed to the male which carries only one X and one smaller Y chromosome (but some mammals, such as the Platypus, have different combinations). To compensate for the difference in size, one of the female's X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell. In birds and reptiles, by contrast, it is the female which is heterozygous and carries a Z and a W chromosome whilst the male carries two Z chromosomes. Intersex conditions can also give rise to other combinations, but this usually results in sterility. 
Mammalian females bear live young (with the rare exception of monotremes, which lay eggs). Some non-mammalian species, such as guppies, have analogous reproductive structures; and some other non-mammals, such as sharks, whose eggs hatch inside their bodies, also have the appearance of bearing live young.
Symbol.
A common symbol used to represent the female sex is ♀ (Unicode: U+2640 Alt codes: Alt+12), a circle with a small cross underneath. According to Schott, the most established view is that the male and female symbols "are derived from contractions in Greek script of the Greek names of these planets, namely Thouros (Mars) and Phosphoros (Venus). These derivations have been traced by Renkama who illustrated how Greek letters can be transformed into the graphic male and female symbols still recognised today." Thouros was abbreviated by θρ, and Phosphoros by Φκ, which were contracted into the modern symbols.
Sex determination.
The sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors. These may be genetic or environmental, or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life. Although most species with male and female sexes have individuals that are either male or female, hermaphroditic animals have both male and female reproductive organs.
Genetic determination.
The sex of most mammals, including humans, is genetically determined by the XY sex-determination system where males have X and Y (as opposed to X and X) sex chromosomes. During reproduction, the male contributes either an X sperm or a Y sperm, while the female always contributes an X egg. A Y sperm and an X egg produce a male, while an X sperm and an X egg produce a female. The ZW sex-determination system, where males have ZZ (as opposed to ZW) sex chromosomes, is found in birds, reptiles and some insects and other organisms. Members of Hymenoptera, such as ants and bees, are determined by haplodiploidy, where most males are haploid and females and some sterile males are diploid.
Environmental determination.
The young of some species develop into one sex or the other depending on local environmental conditions, e.g. many crocodilians' sex is influenced by the temperature of their eggs. Other species (such as the goby) can transform, as adults, from one sex to the other in response to local reproductive conditions (such as a shortage of males).

Knook, Wiltshire

Knook is a village and former civil parish in Wiltshire in South West England. It is now part of the civil parish of Heytesbury, Imber and Knook. Knook is in the Warminster, Copheap and Wylye ward of Wiltshire Counciland the Westbury constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament.
Geography.
The village is on the River Wylye at the edge of Salisbury Plain, about south-east of Warminster, on the A36 road to Salisbury.
Manor.
The "Domesday Book" of 1086 records the manor of Knook as "Cunuche", and its entry mentions a woman of the manor called Leofgyth "who made gold embroideries for the king and queen and still does so".
Much of the present manor house was built in 1637.
Parish church.
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Margaret are early Norman, from the late 11th century. They include decorative carved stonework, which is notable in the tympanum to an arched doorway. St Margret's was a dependent chapelry of the collegiate church of SS. Peter and Paul, Heytesbury. A monumental inscription at St Margaret's dating from 1592 asks ""Of your cheriti praye for ye soule of Iohn Morgan Gentleman and Elinor his wife with all thaire progenitors and all Christians amen"".
Parish registers survive from 1687 and are kept in the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives.
"Imperial Gazetteer" entry.
John Marius Wilson's "Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales" (1870–1872) described Knook as follows:
KNOOK, a parish, with a village, in Warminster district, Wilts; on the river Wiley, the Old Ditch way, and the Somerset and Weymouth railway, 1 mile SE of Heytesbury r. station. Post town, Heytesbury, under Bath. Acres, 1,440. Real property, £1,342. Pop., 208. Houses, 46. The property belongs chiefly to Lord Heytesbury. Knook Castle is an ancient single ditched entrenchment, of about 2 acres; is supposed to have been originally a British village, and afterwards a Roman summer camp; and has yielded Roman coins. Traces of another ancient British village are to the N. "The site of these villages," says Sir R.Hoare, "is decidedly marked by great cavities and a black soil; and the attentive eye may easily trace out the lines of houses and the streets, or rather the hollow ways, conducting to them. Numerous tumuli and barrows are in the neighbourhood." The living is a p. curacy, annexed to the p. curacy of Heytesbury, in the diocese of Salisbury. The church, in Aug., 1866 was about to be repaired.

<doc id="20913907" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913907" title="Inverness by-election, 1954">
Inverness by-election, 1954

The Inverness by-election, 1954 was a by-election held on 21 December 1954 for the British House of Commons constituency of Inverness.
The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, by his application for the Chiltern Hundreds. Douglas-Hamilton had held the seat since 1950.
The result was a victory for the Unionist candidate Neil McLean. McLean held the seat until 1964 when he lost to the Liberal Russell Johnston.
The constituency.
In 1954 the constituency of Inverness was one of the largest Parliamentary constituencies in Britain spread across of Scottish Highland, from the county town of Inverness to the west coast of Scotland and included the Isle of Skye and some nearby islands. More than half the electorate lived in the town of Inverness itself however.
Candidates.
The Tories chose as their representative the 36 year old, Eton and Sandhurst educated Lieutenant Colonel Neil McLean who had lived in the Highlands as a child. McLean had the advantage of knowing that Douglas-Hamilton was going to resign and had moved to the constituency in anticipation of the by-election. He had been installed as the prospective candidate for about 18 months, using the time to get to know the area well and establish a rapport with the electorate. Labour selected Dundee engine driver and trade union official, William Paterson, aged 44. The former Labour candidate at the 1951 general election, Alexander Macnair had indicated he wished to stand again but the local Labour Party preferred a new man. Macnair then said he might put up as an Independent Labour candidate but did not do so in the end. The Liberals, who had not fought the seat at the previous general election in 1951 settled on John Bannerman a Gaelic speaking farmer and former Scotland Rugby international, who had been Liberal candidate for Argyll at the general elections of 1945 and 1950. 
Election issues.
The first political controversy to emerge in relation to Inverness was the timing of the by-election itself. Labour in particular objected to what they called ‘the sharp practice’ of moving the by-election writ by the Tories when they did, based on the deliberate shortening of campaign time this would mean for opposition candidates, especially in a geographically large and electorally scattered constituency and at a difficult time of year - the dead of winter and just before Christmas. According to one account in a national newspaper the topical issues were the problems of depopulation, transport and midges. However the Liberal candidate, John Bannerman, based his campaign on support for home rule for Scotland and an increase in old age pensions. Paterson received a letter of support from former prime minister Clement Attlee reminding voters that the Labour Party in office had developed hydro-electric power and a great programme of afforestation in the Highlands.
Impact.
The by-election result caused little stir at the time, although the Liberals were clearly pleased with their performance given they had not fought the seat in 1951 and had pushed Labour into third place. It does however seem that Inverness served as a portent of what was to come in Scotland over the next few general elections. One historian has commented that the "...Conservative Party was to suffer in the following decades from the effects of growing support for home rule, later translated into support for the Scottish National Party and a rise in support for the Liberals and Labour." Despite the opinion in The Times newspaper that ‘...it is possible to argue that if the Liberals could not recover Inverness this time, when all the circumstances and candidate favoured them, their best days there seem to be over for good’ the Inverness result also pre-figured the Liberal revival of the late 1950s and 1960s when under the leadership of Jo Grimond the party won its first by-election victory since 1929 at Torrington in 1958 and more spectacularly at Orpington in 1962. As already noted, the Liberals best days in Inverness were hardly behind them as they won the seat in 1964 and the Liberal Democrats‘ Danny Alexander holds the equivalent constituency today.

Katherine Heigl

Katherine Marie Heigl (; born November 24, 1978) is an American actress and film producer. She is possibly best known for her role as Dr. Isobel "Izzie" Stevens on ABC's medical drama "Grey's Anatomy" from 2005 to 2010, for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2007. She also starred in films, such as "", "Knocked Up", "27 Dresses", "The Ugly Truth", "Killers", "Life As We Know It" and "New Year's Eve", among others.
Heigl started her career as a child model with Wilhelmina Models before she turned her attention to acting. She made her debut in the coming-of-age film "That Night". Heigl co-starred as Isabel Evans in the television series "Roswell" and films, such as "My Father the Hero" before landing her break-out role in "Grey's Anatomy". Heigl has established herself as a cover model appearing on numerous publications including "Maxim", "Vanity Fair" and "Cosmopolitan". Heigl is married to singer Josh Kelley, with whom she has two adopted daughters.
Early life.
Heigl was born in West End, Washington, D.C., at Columbia Hospital for Women. She is the youngest of four children of Nancy (née Engelhardt), a personnel manager, and Paul Heigl, a financial executive and accountant. Her father is of German (including Swiss-German) and Irish descent, and her mother is of German ancestry. Heigl was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Her siblings are Meg, Jason (deceased), and Holt. Heigl lived in Virginia and then Denver, before her family settled in Connecticut; there, they moved into a large, old Victorian-style farmhouse in the wealthy town of New Canaan, where she spent most of her childhood.
In 1986, her older brother Jason died of injuries suffered in a car accident, after being thrown from the back of a pickup truck while out for lunch with some of his high school classmates. Following his death, the family decided to donate his organs. Heigl was unnerved by this at the time, but later became a strong proponent of organ donation, working as a spokesperson for Donate Life America.
Career.
1986–1998: Early work.
When Heigl was nine, an aunt visiting the family decided to take a number of photographs of her. After returning to her home in New York, her aunt sent the photos to a number of modeling agencies, with the permission of Heigl's parents. Within a few weeks, Heigl was signed with Wilhelmina Models as a child model. Soon after signing with the agency, a client slated Heigl for use in a magazine advertisement where she made her debut. At the time, she was earning $75 an hour posing for Sears and Lord & Taylor catalogs.
Heigl first appeared in her national television spot for Cheerios cereal.
She made her acting debut in the 1992 film "That Night". Heigl appeared as Christina Sebastian in Steven Soderbergh's Depression-era drama "King of the Hill" before being cast in her first leading role in the 1994 comedy "My Father the Hero". During this time, Heigl continued to attend New Canaan High School, balancing her film and modeling work with her academic studies. Heigl dropped out of New Canaan High School after her sophomore year to pursue her career in Hollywood.
In 1995, she starred in the Steven Seagal action thriller "". Heigl portrayed a 16-year-old traveller on a train across a mountain pass to visit the grave of her deceased father with uncle Casey Ryback (Seagal), an ex-SEAL counter-terrorist expert. The main plotline has the train hijacked by mercenaries in Colorado, keeping her as a hostage. Much of her work in the film was opposite Morris Chestnut, Sandra Taylor and Everett McGill.
Despite an increased focus on acting, she still modeled extensively, appearing regularly in magazines such as "Seventeen". She landed the lead role in Disney's made-for-television film "Wish Upon a Star" in 1996, portraying two body-swapping characters along with Danielle Harris, the same year as Heigl's parents divorced and her mother was diagnosed with cancer. After her high school graduation in 1997, she moved into a four-bedroom house in Malibu Canyon, California with her mother, who also became her manager.
In 1998, she co-starred with Peter Fonda in a re-working of the classic Shakespearean play "The Tempest", set during the American Civil War and starred in the horror film "Bride of Chucky".
1999–2004: Rise to fame.
In 1999, Heigl turned her attention to television when she accepted the role of Isabel Evans on the science fiction TV drama "Roswell", a role that was expanded in the show's second and third seasons. Heigl had auditioned for all three of the show's female leads (the other two roles eventually went to Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino) before she was finally cast as Isabel, an alien human hybrid.
Heigl was frequently featured in photo essays in magazines such as "Life", "TV Guide", and "Teen" as well as "FHM". She appeared in the "FHM" and "Maxim" calendars, "FHM"'s annual "100 Sexiest Women in the World", and was featured in the Girls of Maxim Gallery. In May 2006, "Maxim" awarded her #12 on their annual Hot 100List as well as voted the 19th "Sexiest Woman in the World" by readers of "FHM" magazine. While "Roswell" was in production, Heigl worked on several films, including "100 Girls", an independent 2001 film, and "Valentine", a horror film starring David Boreanaz and Denise Richards.
Heigl accepted a role in "Ground Zero", a television thriller scheduled to be telecast that fall which was based on the bestselling James Mills novel "The Seventh Power", in the spring of 2001. She co-starred as a brilliant and politically-concerned college student who helps to build a nuclear device to illustrate the need for a change in national priorities. The device ends up in the hands of a terrorist following betrayal by a fellow student. However, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the film was shelved when its plot was considered inappropriate. It reemerged in 2003 under the title "Critical Assembly". After the attacks, Heigl recorded a public service announcement for the American Red Cross in an effort to help raise money for victims.
In 2003, Heigl appeared in three television movies. She returned to the horror genre with "Evil Never Dies", a modern-day variation on the "Frankenstein" story co-starring Thomas Gibson. "Love Comes Softly", for Hallmark Entertainment, found Heigl starring as Marty Claridge, a young, pregnant newlywed traveling west. (She reprised the role of Marty in the sequel "Love's Enduring Promise" the next year.) Heigl played Isabella Linton in MTV's modern revamp of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights". In October 2003, Heigl was cast opposite Johnny Knoxville in "The Ringer", a Farrelly brothers comedy that was released in December 2005. Heigl starred as Romy in the 2005 television movie "", a prequel to the 1997 film "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion".
2005–2010: "Grey's Anatomy" and transition to film.
In 2005, Heigl was cast in what would become her most high-profile role to date, as medical intern Dr. Isobel "Izzie" Stevens on "Grey's Anatomy", an ABC medical drama. The show, originally introduced as a mid-season replacement, became a huge ratings success and is still one of the highest-rated television series on broadcast television. The same year, Heigl landed the starring role in the independent film, "Side Effects", a romantic comedy about marketing and the pharmaceutical industry, where she was also executive producer.
In late 2006, Heigl was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film for her work on "Grey's Anatomy". Also in 2006, she filmed "Knocked Up", a comedy from writer/director Judd Apatow, starring opposite Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, and Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann. Upon its June 2007 theatrical release, the film received largely positive reviews from critics, and proved to be a box office success. The fees Heigl could command increased after the film's success. The movie grossed $148,761,765 in the U.S., for which she earned a salary of $300,000 USD. In a highly publicized "Vanity Fair" interview, Heigl admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow and Rogen when she starred in "Knocked Up", she had a hard time enjoying the film itself. She called the movie "a little sexist", claiming that the film "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys". In his review for "The Guardian", humorist Joe Queenan called "Knocked Up" "the latest in a new genre of romantic comedies in which an unappealing hero gets together with a gorgeous, successful woman".
Heigl's comments spurred widespread reaction in the media, primarily consisting of personal attacks in which she was called "an ungrateful traitor", "hypocrite", and "assertive, impatient go-getter who quickly tired of waiting for her boyfriend to propose", in some cases deriding her religious beliefs and criticizing her private relationships. Heigl clarified her remarks to "People" magazine, stating that, "My motive was to encourage other women like myself to not take that element of the movie too seriously and to remember that it's a broad comedy", adding that, "Although I stand behind my opinion, I'm disheartened that it has become the focus of my experience with the movie". Despite her run of success, she also starred in the box office bomb "Zyzzyx Road" which despite being filmed in 2004, was not released until 2006. It has been cited as the lowest grossing film of all time. She has been on "FHM"'s "100 Sexiest Women in the World" list twice as of 2007.
On September 16, 2007, Heigl won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Izzie Stevens. In her acceptance speech she acknowledged that even her mother did not believe she would win, and when her name was called, she had to be censored vocally by the telecast's producers, due to her saying "Shit!" when she reacted to the win. Earlier, she had corrected telecast announcer Rebecca Riedy, who had been given an incorrect phonetic spelling of Heigl's name, when she mispronounced her name as "Hi-jell" before the presentation of the award with Kyle Chandler for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie. In January 2008 she starred in the film, "27 Dresses", for which she was paid $6 million USD, and appeared alongside James Marsden. Following the release of "27 Dresses", the "New York Post" expressed some disappointment with the mismatch of Heigl's talent with the "chick-flick" triviality of the film, suggesting that Heigl might be more compatible "with female directors such as Kimberly Peirce ("Boys Don't Cry") or Tamara Jenkins ("The Savages")...". Heigl was announced the "Most Desirable Woman of 2008", according to AskMen.com.
There was some speculation that Heigl might be leaving "Grey's Anatomy" after the end of the 2008–2009 season. This speculation revolved around her refusal to put her name in for Emmy consideration and the time she had devoted to producing a film version of Carolyn Jessop's book "Escape". "Grey's" showrunner Shonda Rhimes said she was not insulted by Heigl's Emmy withdrawal, but also noted that Heigl's character Izzie had less to do during the season because Heigl asked for a light work schedule. However, despite Heigl's reported displeasure with the previous season as well as suggestions that her character had died, Heigl's return for the sixth season of "Grey's" was confirmed by ABC.
Heigl starred with Gerard Butler in "The Ugly Truth", which opened on July 24, 2009. Upon release, the film was made on a budget of $38 million and earned $205 million at the worldwide box office.
In June 2010, Heigl starred in the Lionsgate comedy-thriller "Killers", with Ashton Kutcher and then starred in and produced the big-screen drama "Life As We Know It", directed by Greg Berlanti, which revolved around a woman and a man whose respective best friends die in a car accident; following the tragedy, they are left to share in caring for the deceased's orphaned daughter. Heigl received $12 million for both films.
Speculation as to whether Heigl would leave "Grey's Anatomy" lingered throughout most of season six. However, on March 11, 2010, Heigl reportedly did not show up for work when she was supposed to, and she and Shonda Rhimes had apparently come to an agreement to release her from her contract immediately. Therefore, Heigl's last appearance on the January 21 episode of "Grey's Anatomy" is also her final appearance on the season. Heigl said that her departure was not about advancing her film career but that she wanted to focus more on her family.
2011–present: Recent film roles and return to television.
In December 2011, Heigl appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy "New Year's Eve", directed by Garry Marshall. Despite being a commercial success, grossing over $142 million worldwide, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. In 2012, she had the lead role in "One for the Money". The film was a box-office failure. It grossed just over $36 million worldwide, failing to recoup its production budget of $40 million. For her performance, Heigl received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress.
In January 2012, Heigl stated in an interview that she has asked the producers of "Grey's Anatomy" if she could return to the show to wrap up Izzie's storyline: "I’ve told them I want to she said. “I really, really, really want to see where [Izzie is. I just want to know what happened to her and where she went and what she’s doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." She also went on to say that she regrets leaving the show: "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," and again commented on the possibility of Izzie returning to the show, "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there."
In November 2012, Heigl was cast and voiced Andie in the animated film "The Nut Job", which was released on January 17, 2014.
In February 2013, it was reported that Heigl had joined Ben Lewin's romantic drama "A Moment to Remember". Filming has yet to take place. In April 2013, she appeared alongside Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, and Susan Sarandon in "The Big Wedding". In June 2013, Heigl began appearing in a television commercial for Vicks' ZzzQuil.
In January 2014, it was reported that Heigl would return to television in an NBC drama series named "State of Affairs" about a CIA attache.
Charity work.
Heigl has worked with Best Friends Animal Society on several projects including their Pup My Ride program. The program transports small dogs from high-kill animal shelters to other parts of the US where there is a greater demand for such dogs. Her involvement in this led her to give Best Friends a grant which would fund a year of the program.
Heigl and her mother, Nancy, then started Heigl's Hounds of Hope which operates as part of the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation. The Foundation was created in honor of Katherine's brother, who was killed in a car accident in 1986 at the age of fifteen. Heigl's Hounds of Hope rescues larger dogs with behavior problems from shelters with a high kill rate and rehabilitates them through training and other adjustments to make them suitable for re-homing.
As of 2009, Heigl had six dogs of her own.
On behalf of PETA, she signed a letter to members of the Utah legislature, urging them to reject a law that would make undercover filming in factory farms a criminal offense.
Personal life.
In June 2006, Heigl became engaged to singer Josh Kelley, whom she had met a year earlier on the set of his music video for "Only You". They chose not to live together before they were married, with Heigl later explaining, "I think I just wanted to save something for the actual marriage... I wanted there to be something to make the actual marriage different than the dating or the courtship." They were married on December 23, 2007, in Park City, Utah. 
In September 2009, the couple adopted a daughter, Nancy Leigh "Naleigh" Kelley, from South Korea, the birthplace of Heigl's adoptive sister. Naleigh, whom they named after Heigl's mother and sister, was born with a heart defect and underwent open heart surgery before leaving Korea. In April 2012, Kelley and Heigl adopted a second daughter, Adalaide Marie Hope Kelley, from the U.S.

Moustafa Farroukh (in Arabic مصطفى فروخ) (born 1901 - died 1957) was one of Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 20th century. During his famed career, Farroukh produced over 2000 paintings most of which were acquired by collectors both in Lebanon and abroad. He also wrote five books including a biography. 
Career.
He was formally trained in Rome and graduated in 1927 from Rome's Royal College of Fine Arts. He proceeded to Paris and continued further studies under the guidance of Paul Émile Chabas, the president of the Society of French Artists and many other French artists. 
Over his prosperous career, he exhibited in venues from Paris, Venice, New York and Beirut. In his Studio in Beirut, he established a permanent exhibition of his artwork in 1932.
His work was applauded for its representation of real life in Lebanon in pictures of the country, its people and its customs. He travelled through Spain in the early 1930s where his appreciation of Arabic art and architecture had a long lasting effect on his artistic touch. He produced several paintings representing the Arab legacy in Spain.
Farroukh became highly regarded as a Lebanese national painter at a time when Lebanon was asserting its political independence. His art captured the spirit and character of the Lebanese people and he became recognized as the outstanding Lebanese painter of his generation. Most of his paintings were portraits, landmarks, or scenery from his homeland Lebanon. In 1950, as a tribute to his work, Farroukh's name was chosen for listing in Benezit, the world's renowned collection for bibliographical art reference.
Farroukh also wrote five books and taught art at the American University of Beirut and lectured in various academies. He joined the group of philosophers, thinkers, and men and women of literature who lectured in the renowned "Al Nadwa" gatherings or "Le Cénacle Libanais".
In 1954, he was awarded the "Order of Merit", and the "Order of the Cedar" by the Lebanese government.
In 1974, he was portrayed on a Lebanese airmail postage stamp in recognition of his work.

Law of Thailand

The laws of Thailand are based on the civil law, but have been influenced by common law (see also world legal systems).
Sources of Law.
The Rattanakosin Kingdom and the four traditionally counted preceding kingdoms, collectively called Siam, had a largely uncodified constitution until 1932. In the King of Siam's preamble to the Penal Code which was promulgated on April 1, 1908, and came into operation on September 21st, his Majesty the king said: "In the ancient times the monarchs of the Siamese nation governed their people with laws which were originally derived from the Dhamasustra of Manu, which was then the prevailing law among the inhabitants of India and the neighbouring countries."
The principle law sources in Thailand are:
Public Law.
Constitutional Law.
The Constitution of Thailand is the supreme law of Thailand which prevails over other laws passed by parliament. The 2007 Constitution of Thailand is the most recent constitution. The Constitutional Court of Thailand has jurisdiction to make rulings over the constitutionality of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, draft legislation, appointment and removal of public officials and issues regarding political parties (see Rulings of the Constitutional Court of Thailand).
Criminal Law.
Criminal offences (that can lead to arrest and imprisonment) are enumerated in the Thai Penal Code (or Criminal Code) as well as numerous other statutes. Criminal procedures are outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code.
Administrative Law.
Administrative Law matters such as judicial review are handled by the Administrative Court, which was established under The Act On Establishment Of Administrative Courts And Administrative Court Procedure BE 2542 (1999). The jurisdiction of the court includes unlawful act by an administrative agency or State official (e.g. ultra vires, inconsistent with law, bad faith etc.), neglecting or unreasonable delay in official duties, wrongful act or other liability of an administrative agency, administrative contracts, mandating a person to do something or an injunction.
Immigration Law.
Visa and immigration law is outlined in the Immigration Act BE 2522 (1979) and its amendments. The Immigration Bureau of the Royal Thai Police administers the law, while the Immigration Commission shall have power and duty to make decision such as giving or revoking permission to stay.
Private Law.
The most important reference of private law (or civil law) is the Civil and Commercial Code of Thailand (see also other civil codes). It is composed of several books. Books I and II were first promulgated on 11 November 1925 (BE 2466). The Civil code is updated as required by amendment acts (for example "Act Amending Civil and Commercial Code (No 14)" BE 2548 (AD 2005)).
Law of Obligations.
The Law of Obligations in general is found in Civil and Commercial Code sections 194 to 353 (Book II, Title I). 
Quasi-contracts include undue enrichment, sections 406 to 419 (Book II, Title IV), and management of affairs without mandate, sections 395 to 405 (Book II, Title III).
Law of Obligations - Contract Law.
The main source of contract law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 354 to 394 (Book II, Title II). Specific contracts (Sale, Hire, Mortgage, Insurance, Bills etc.) are found in the Civil and Commercial Code sections 453 to 1011 (Book III, Titles I to XXI).
Law of Obligations - Tort or Delict Law.
Tort law or delict law falls within the law of obligations. It is found in the Civil and Commercial Code sections 420 to 452 (Book II, Title V). The Code deals with wrongful acts: liability, compensation and exemptions to liability (justifiable acts).
Corporate Law.
Basic corporate Law is found in the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1012 to 1273 (Book II, Title XXII).
Foreign ownership of certain Thai industries and foreign companies in general are regulated by the Foreign Business Act BE 2542 (AD 1999).
Personal Property Law.
The main source of property law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1298 to 1434 (Book IV).
Land Law.
Land Law is dealt with by the Land Code. This was established by Act Promulgating the Land Code, B.E. 2497 (AD 1954).
Land in Thailand is covered by a system consisting of several title deeds offering different rights of use, possession, ownership or alienation. Most titles are issued by the Land Department and fall within 7 main categories. Another 5 categories are issued by other government departments for specific purposes.
The Chanote (or Nor Sor 4 Jor) category, found in more developed parts of Thailand, offers private ownership (similar to freehold land). Other land is considered to belong to the government or the King of Thailand.
Intellectual property.
Intellectual Property Law, that is patents, trademarks and copyright, are protected by the Patent Act BE 2522 (1979), Trademark Act BE 2534 (1991) and the Copyright Act BE 2521 (1978) and their amendments respectively. Trade secrets are protected by the Trade Secret Act BE 2545 (2002). The Department of Intellectual Property (DIP) manages intellectual property matters such as registration and enforcement. A registration system exists for trademarks and patents. Copyright is automatically protected for 50 years and does not need registration, however it can be filed with the DIP. Disputes are first heard in the Intellectual Property and International Trade Court.
Family Law.
The main source of family law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1435 to 1598 (Book V).
Succession Law.
The main source of succession law is the Civil and Commercial Code sections 1599 to 1755 (Book VI).
Laws Relating to Foreigners.
Foreign Business Act BE 2542 (AD 1999) - regulates foreign ownership of certain Thai industries and foreign companies in general.

<doc id="20913980" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913980" title="Sitcom">
Sitcom

A situation comedy, often shortened to sitcom, is a genre of comedy that features characters sharing the same common environment, such as a home or workplace, with often humorous dialogue. Such programs originated in radio, but today, sitcoms are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms.
A situation comedy television program may be recorded in front of a studio audience. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated by the use of a laugh track.
Characteristics.
As opposed to stand up comedy and sketch comedy, a situation comedy has a storyline and ongoing characters in, essentially, a comedic drama. The situation is usually that of a family, workplace, or a group of friends through comedic sequences.
Traditionally comedy sketches were presented within a variety show and mixed with musical performances, as in vaudeville. The emerging mass medium of radio allowed audiences to regularly return to programmes, so programmes could feature the same characters and situations each episode and expect audiences to be familiar with them.
Sitcom humor is often character driven and by its nature running gags evolve during a series. Often the status quo of the situation is maintained from episode to episode. An episode may feature a disruption to the usual situation and the character interactions, but this will usually be settled by the episode's end and the situation returned to how it was prior to the disruption. These episodes are then linked by the overarching storyline, driving the show forward.
History.
Comedies from past civilizations, such as those of Aristophanes and Menander in ancient Greece, Terence and Plautus in ancient Rome, Śudraka in ancient India, and numerous examples including Shakespeare, Molière, the Commedia dell'arte and the Punch and Judy shows from post-Renaissance Europe, are the ancestors of the modern sitcom. Some of the characters, pratfalls, routines and situations as preserved in eyewitness accounts and in the texts of the plays themselves, are remarkably similar to those in earlier modern sitcoms such as "I Love Lucy" and "The Honeymooners". The first television sitcom is said to be "Pinwright's Progress", ten episodes being broadcast on the BBC between 1946–1947. In the U.S., director and producer William Asher has been credited with being the "man who invented the sitcom," having directed over two dozen of the leading sitcoms, including "I Love Lucy," during the 1950s through the 1970s.
By country.
Australia.
There have been few long running Australian made sitcoms, but many US and UK sitcoms have been successful there. UK sitcoms are a staple of government broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and many UK sitcoms were shown by the Seven Network. By 1986 UK comedies "Bless This House" and "Are You Being Served?" had been repeated by ABC Television several times, and were then acquired and screened by the Seven Network, in prime time.
US sitcoms have been common on the three commercial networks, and on subscription and free to air digital broadcasters.
Several Australian sitcoms have been produced, but many ran for just a single season - usually 13 half-hour episodes. Many successful Australian sitcoms were similar in style to British comedies, and closely followed the premise of UK sitcoms. An early success was "My Name's McGooley, What's Yours?" (1967) about a working-class Sydney family. Other popular sitcoms of time included "The Group", and "Our Man in Canberra".
In the 1970s Crawford Productions, best known for police procedurals, created sitcoms "The Last of the Australians" (1975-1976) on the Nine Network, "The Bluestone Boys" (1976) on Network Ten, and "Bobby Dazzler" (1977) on the Seven Network. The ABC's "Alvin Purple" (1976), was a sex comedy based on the hit feature film "Alvin Purple", with Graeme Blundell reprising the title role. 
By the late 1970s, Australian versions of popular UK comedies were produced using key personnel from the original series. They retained the title and key cast members of the original and continued the same story premise, transplanting key original characters to Australian based situations markedly similar to those of the original. "Doctor in the House" (as "Doctor Down Under") and "Father, Dear Father" (as "Father, Dear Father in Australia") were made with the participation of William G. Stewart, who also produced original series, the short-lived "The Tea Ladies" (1978), in Australia. An Australian made spin-off from "Love Thy Neighbour" was produced in 1979, and an Australian remake of "Are You Being Served?" (1980) ran two seasons. 
Sketch comedy series "The Naked Vicar Show" (1977-1978), written and produced by Gary Reilly and Tony Sattler of RS Productions, spawned a successful sitcom spin off, "Kingswood Country" (1980-1984). Its situation was somewhat similar to UK comedy "Till Death Us Do Part", and "The Last of the Australians". The company's other sitcoms of the era, "Daily at Dawn" (1981) and "Brass Monkeys" (1984), were less successful. "Kingswood Country" remained a fondly recalled success and the later "Bullpitt!" (1997-1998) revived its central character, bombastic bigot Ted Bullpitt (Ross Higgins).
The ABC's "Mother and Son" (1984-1994) enjoyed enduring popularity. After the late 1980s several new Australian sitcoms achieved significant success and "Frontline", "Acropolis Now", and "All Together Now" had relatively long runs. Short-lived sitcoms of the era included "Late for School" and "Bingles" (both 1992).
Gary Reilly Productions' sitcom "Hey Dad...!" (1987-1994) was a popular success. The company's other sitcoms of the era, "Hey Dad...!" spin-off "Hampton Court" (1991), and "My Two Wives" (1992), were less successful and lasted just one season. On the ABC, "The Adventures of Lano and Woodley" (1997-1999) ran two seasons, and in 2002 "Kath and Kim" began its successful run.
Canada.
Canadian television comedy is equally divided between the sitcom, sketch comedy, and dramedy. Canadian English-language sitcoms compete directly for audiences with American-made sitcoms, which are widely available in Canada on basic cable television. Like American-made sitcoms, most Canadian sitcoms are half-hour programs in which the story is written to run a total of 22 minutes in length, leaving eight minutes for commercials. A few sitcoms are hour-long programs, with 16 minutes allowed for commercials.
Domestically, Canadian broadcasting is divided along linguistic lines. Quebec French-language sitcoms almost never reach anglophone audiences, while English-language sitcoms are carried only on Quebec English-language television channels and are never remade in French. A second cultural divide, between Canada and the United States, is commonly played up in sitcoms such as An American in Canada and Due South.
Altogether, there are usually about half a dozen Canadian sitcoms airing new episodes at any given time, although many do not make it to a second season. However, many of the Canadian sitcoms which do make it receive syndicated airplay around the world.
The most successful Canadian sitcoms include "King of Kensington", "The Beachcombers", "Trailer Park Boys", "Twitch City", "Hangin' In", "Made In Canada", "Little Mosque on the Prairie" and "Corner Gas". Little Mosque on the Prairie is the most internationally syndicated series. Corner Gas may be the most popular Canadian sitcom of the modern television era. Notable francophone sitcoms include "Histoires de filles", "Moi et l'autre", 4 et demi, La Petite Vie, Dans une galaxie près de chez-vous, Radio Enfer, and Rumeurs.
Canadian sitcoms have also explored animation and puppetry in sitcoms such as "Puppets Who Kill" and Total Drama, which satirizes competitive reality television. The Emmy-winning sitcom "6teen" is syndicated in two dozen countries.
Particularly popular Canadian sitcoms have been honoured with statues and other monuments. A statue of Al Waxman as the "king" of Kensington can be found in Kensington Market, Toronto. "Persephone," the tugboat used by Nick Adonidas on "The Beachcombers," is displayed in a small park near "Molly's Reach," a restaurant opened in the building that was the set for the sitcom restaurant of the same name in Gibsons, British Columbia.
China.
China, mainly Beijing's television studios, has produced a strong number of comedies with high episode counts. The first multi-camera sitcom was "I Love My Family", in 1993. While inspired by American sitcoms, "I Love My Family" used actors with theatre experience to display comedic and dramatic talents. "Home with Kids" is another Chinese sitcom heavily based on "Growing Pains", which dealt with real-life family issues and ran for over 350 episodes. It was known for featuring child actors, who have prominent roles throughout the series.
For the teen audience, China has produced the "Friends"-inspired "iPartment". Like "Friends", the Shanghai-based "iPartment" follows a group of neighbors in their escapades. The series uses fast-paced editing and surreal pop culture references for comic effect. "iPartment" has 20 hour-long episodes and is filmed on-location and closed sets. Despite this, the series contains a laugh track, which is an uncommon practice used for single-camera programs.
Hong Kong has a strong number of sitcoms that differ from Mainland China's programs. An average sitcom does not use a studio audience nor a laugh track to fill-in more dialogue for the characters. Also, many programs used large sets and locations to film more dynamically.
Czech Republic.
The first Czech sitcom was called Nováci, which ran in 1995. It was paused because of bad ratings and production ambitions to create a better one. In 1996 the new sitcom Nováci 2 was aired, which many considered worse than original series and was stopped after 52 episodes. The original series from 1995 had 72 episodes. In 1996 26 episodes of a new series called Hospoda (Pub)aired which became very successful, so a second series with 26 episodes was created in 1997. In 1999 a series called Policajti z předměstí (Suburb Cops) aired which was unpopular and was ended after 21 episodes, but it has lot of fans today. In 2001 aired sitcom Duch Český and in 2008 Cyranův ostrov written by famous Czech country singer Ivan Mládek. In the same year the sitcom Profesionálové (Professionals) aired which was stopped after 11 episodes but which inspired a very successful Slovakian version. In autumn 2008 began the first sitcom series Comeback which many consider the best Czech sitcom; the series had 30 episodes. In 2009 aired a new series of Cyranův ostrov called Cyranův poloostrov with a new main plot, and in 2010 began a new version of Profesionálové with some new actors, new scriptwriters, and a new director. But it was not very successful again. In the autumn of the same year start the second series of Comeback and was very successful again, and it had 21 episodes. The final episode was broadcast in autumn 2011. In the same year was introduce Noha 22 of Ivan Mládek - sitcom from hospital, but it very bad. TV Nova introduced Helena in spring 2012 after the successful Comeback. Helena was renewed in the autumn 2012 for the second season and for the third season in first part of year 2013. TV Nova canceled Helena in autumn 2013 and introduce PanMáma ("Mr. Momma") by British original. But now TV Nova has financial problems and canceled many series and broadcasts including PanMáma, but ratings was bad anyway. In January 2014 started the first episode of new sitcom Čtvrtá hvězda ("Fourth Star") from Czech television with the good ratings 1,2 million and even better criticisms.
Denmark.
The first respected Danish sitcom was Langt Fra Las Vegas (Far From Las Vegas), written by Casper Christensen. It aired from 2001 until 2003. The series was about a TV station and the employees, but mainly Casper, played by Casper Christensen. The first season was called "Season 0" and was very different from the other 4 seasons. Kenny, played by Frank Hvam, was changed from a smart ass, to a nerd. The kid like Wulff, played by Mikael Wulff, was written out of the story. When Langt fra Las Vegas ended, Casper made up a new sitcom called Klovn (Clown), which ran from 2005 to 2009. Casper and Frank played themselves. When the series ended, Klovn - The Movie came in the cinemas one and a half year later. The movie became quite successful. Another of the more popular sitcoms was Kristian, which were written by Christian Fuhlendorff. Christian also played Kristian. The first season ran from November 2009, and had 10 episodes. In 2011, Christian Fuhlendorff announced on his Facebook, that there would be a second season in the Autum 2011. In the start of 2011 the sitcom Lykke (Lykke is the name of the protagonist. The name Lykke is Danish, and means "Happiness") aired, and lasted 10 episodes. Not soon after its ending, DR1 announced that there would be another season.
Germany.
The first German sitcoms were "Ein Herz und eine Seele" and "Motzki", written by Wolfgang Menge. "Ein Herz und eine Seele" was produced by West German Radio WDR in Cologne, with Heinz Schubert. "Ein Herz und eine Seele" shows the coexistence of a German family in a row house in the Ruhr-region during the 1970s: They treated besides usual everyday topics, especially the coincidence of extremely small bourgeois-conservative attitude of parents with the idealistic approach of the '68 movement. Another very important contemporary sitcom is "Dittsche", a German improvisation comedy television show starring Olli Dittrich and Jon Flemming Olsen.
Olli Dittrich plays the unemployed Dittsche, who frequents a local fast food diner and converses with the proprietor about current events, drawing heavily on bizarre tabloid headlines to formulate perplexingly insane theories about their background. Schildkröte (German word for "Turtle"), a bar regular (played by Franz Jarnach), looks on mostly passively in the background.
The show is unscripted and is broadcast live from a real fast food diner in Hamburg. One special feature of the show is the camera perspective, which changes in a fixed pattern and is digitally processed to mimic surveillance cameras. The show also features many celebrities from German TV and sports, who appear as customers of the diner.
Another famous sitcom was Zebralla, with the famous German Comedian Dieter Hallervorden. The book was written by German Comedy Writer Frank Lüdeke. Hallervorden is the head of the German comedy Theatre "Die Wühlmäuse" based in Berlin, where the sitcom was filmed. Zebralla tells the story of an old man, starting to study again at the University as an student. The sitcom tells in a satirical way the contrast between the young and the old generation.
India.
Sitcoms started appearing on Indian television in the 1980s, with serials like "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi" (1984) and "Wagle Ki Duniya" (1988) on the state-run Doordarshan channel. Gradually, as private channels were allowed, many more sitcoms followed in the 1990s, such as "Zabaan Sambhalke" (1993), "Shrimaan Shrimati" (1995), "Office Office" (2001), Vijay TV (Tamil Channel, Kalakka povathu yaaru) "Khichdi" (2002), "Sarabhai vs Sarabhai" (2005) to "Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah" (2008-present). "Amrutham" (2001-2007) in Telugu, in particular, is a popular sitcom, its popularity resulting in a movie franchise.
Akkara Kazhchakal is a Malayalam sitcom that aired on Kairali TV from 2008 to 2010. The series consisted of fifty episodes, and chronicled the lives of a middle-class Malayali family who have settled in the United States. The show was created by Abi Varghese and Ajayan Venugopalan and starred relative newcomers as the leads.
New Zealand.
New Zealand began producing television programs later than many other developed countries. Due to New Zealand's small population, the two main New Zealand networks will rarely fund more than one or two sitcoms each year. This low output means there is less chance of a successful sitcom being produced to offset the failures.
Early sitcoms included "Joe & Koro" and "Buck House". Later there was "The Billy T James Show" subsequently rerun in early 2004 as part of the first year's offering on Māori Television. The team of David McPhail and Jon Gadsby produced and/or starred in sitcoms such as "Letter to Blanchy" with help from writer A K Grant. The most popular and successful NZ sitcom from this era was Roger Hall's "Gliding On", based on his hit stage play "Glide Time". Another Hall play, "Conjugal Rites" was also made into a sitcom but by Granada in Britain.
In 1994, "Melody Rules" was produced and screened. Critically and commercially unsuccessful, it has become part of the lexicon within the television industry to describe an unsuccessful sitcom, for example, "that show will be the next "Melody Rules"".
Another sitcom to have its roots in a stage play was "Serial Killers" (2003), about the scriptwriters of a medical soap opera.
Most recently the duo Flight of the Conchords have created and starred in a sitcom of an eponymous name. The show stars three Kiwis (including Rhys Darby), is written primarily by the two leads, Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (along with contributions from Kiwis Duncan Sarkies and Taika Waititi), but it is shot entirely in New York City, was co-created by an Englishman, James Bobin, and is funded by HBO, an American premium cable channel. It is the most popular sitcom ever produced featuring Kiwi comedians.
The most successful true NZ sitcom to date, which also utilizes the one-camera approach, is the Jaquie Brown Diaries. The first season (July 2008) ran for 6 episodes. The second season (Oct 2009) ran for 8 episodes.
Many British and American sitcoms are and have been popular in New Zealand.
It is commonly claimed that the primary difficulties for New Zealand comedy production are a prevailing attitude of cultural cringe wherein domestic products are viewed as automatically being inferior, and the market demand for profitability due to New Zealand having no strictly commercial-free channels. Both government-owned channels TVOne and TV2 are broadcast with commercials and cannot survive on government subsidies alone. Some suggest that Kiwi comedies which are viewed as commercially unreliable are often relegated to poor timeslots and not promoted by their networks. James Griffin, creator of TV3's Outrageous Fortune, has noted that often Kiwi comedies get neglected to death such as his show Diplomatic Immunity did.
Pakistan.
The Pakistan Television Corporation began airing sitcoms soon after its launch in 1961. Its early sitcoms included "Fifty Fifty", "Aangan Terha", and "Alif Noon", and these popular shows were considered part of a golden era for Pakistani television. In the 1990s, popular Pakistani sitcoms were "Studio Dhai (2-1/2)" and "Studio Ponay Teen (2-3/4)". Popular sitcoms in the 2000s included "Banana News Network (BNN)", "Ham Sab Umeed Say Hain" and "Khabar Nak", all from the Geo Television Network, and "Hasb-e-Haal" from Dunya News.
Serbia.
One of the first sitcoms on Belgrade TV was "Servisna stanica" (The Service Station) which started in February 1959 and ran for two years (two seasons, 16 episodes each). The Serbian brand of comedy was very influential in the Balkan region. Other popular sitcoms from the '70s onwards were "Kamiondzije" and "Pozoriste u kuci" in the 1970s, "Price iz radionice" in the 1980s, and "Otvorena vrata" in the 1990s.
Turkey.
The first Turkish sitcom was "Kaynanalar" ("Mothers in Law") that started in 1974 and ran for 30 years. Telling the story of a typical Turkish family, Kaynanalar was very popular. Among the most loved modern sitcoms, "Avrupa Yakasi" ("European Side"), "Çocuklar Duymasin" ("Don't Let the Children Hear") and "Yahşi Cazibe" ("Beautiful Attraction") have also been very popular in Middle Eastern countries. Yalan Dünya ("The World is a Lie") which has the same scriptwriter with Avrupa Yakası has started beginning of the 2012. 
United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom has produced a wealth of sitcoms, many of which have been exported to other countries or even adapted to better fit local audiences. British sitcoms often exhibit a tendency towards black humour. A frequent theme in British sitcoms is that of people trapped in an unpleasant situation ("Porridge", "'Allo 'Allo!") or a dysfunctional relationship ("Only Fools and Horses", "Rising Damp" and "Steptoe and Son").
British sitcoms have also tended to shy away from the folksy homespun nature of the American sitcom and into more adult or intellectual territory - "Yes Minister" being an example of the latter.
Other examples of popular British comedy shows that have also enjoyed international success include Black Books and The IT Crowd.
United States.
Most American sitcoms generally include episodes of 20 to 30 minutes in length, where the story is written to run a total of 22 minutes in length, leaving eight minutes for commercials.
Many American sitcoms have acquired universal critical acclaim, especially TV shows like "Seinfeld", "How I Met Your Mother" and "Friends".
Sitcoms made outside the U.S. may run somewhat longer or shorter. U.S. commercial broadcasters have traditionally been very reluctant to greenlight shows that run too short or too long. Thus, very few British or Commonwealth sitcoms can be found on U.S. commercial television. Some popular British shows have been successfully adapted for the U.S.
U.S. sitcoms (like other American television series) typically have long season runs of 20 or more episodes due to the way they are produced. Canadian sitcoms typically only have season runs of 14 on average. British sitcoms have much shorter seasons in comparison where there are usually six episodes.
American sitcoms are often written by large teams of U.S. resident script writers during round-table sessions, but some U.S. sitcoms often do have episodes written by a guest writer. Most British sitcoms are written by one or two people, with four writers sometimes being the norm for some series in the recent past.
Usually sitcoms from the U.S. have satire and slapstick comedy in their status. America has made numerous sitcoms since 1947, including sitcoms aimed specifically at children and teenagers. A sub-genre of U.S. sitcoms, seen as early as the 1950s but more prominent since the 1970s, is the black sitcom, a sitcom featuring a predominantly African American cast.
Sitcoms on U.S. radio.
The sitcom format was born on January 1926 with the initial broadcast of "Sam 'n' Henry" on WGN in Chicago. The 15-minute daily program was revamped in 1928, moved to another station, renamed "Amos 'n' Andy", and became one of the most successful sitcoms from this period. It was also one of the earliest examples of radio syndication. Like many radio programs of the time, the two programs continued the American entertainment traditions of vaudeville and the minstrel show.
"The Jack Benny Program" was another important and formative sitcom (which also functioned as a variety show, depending on the week's script and guest stars involved). The radio version began in 1932 and lasted until 1955 A televised version of the show ran from 1950 to 1965. In total, the show was broadcast for a third of a century.
"Blondie" was a situation comedy adapted from the Blondie comic strip by Chic Young. The radio program had a long run on several networks from 1939 to 1950.
"Fibber McGee and Molly" was one of the most successful sitcoms of all time, airing on radio from 1935 to 1959. The show starred vaudevillians James "Jim" and Marian Driscoll Jordan and also had its roots in Chicago.
In 1947, "Beulah" became the first radio sitcom featuring an African American actor in the lead role.
Sitcoms on U.S. television.
1940s–1950s.
In the late 1940s, the sitcom was among the first formats adapted for the new medium of television. Most sitcoms were a half-hour in length and aired weekly. Many of the earliest sitcoms were direct adaptations of existing radio shows, such as or "The Jack Benny Program", or vehicles for existing radio stars such as Burns and Allen ("The Burns and Allen Show") and film stars such as Abbott and Costello ("The Abbott and Costello Show"). Early sitcoms were broadcast live, recorded on kinescopes, or not recorded at all.
"Mary Kay and Johnny" was followed by "The Goldbergs" which first aired on January 17, 1949. The television adaptation of "Beulah" in 1950 became the first TV sitcom with an African American in the lead. Both "The Goldbergs" and "Beulah" were early examples of sitcoms without a laugh-track or studio audience.
Early sitcoms done on film, though without the multiple-camera setup, included "The Life of Riley" with William Bendix, and Stu Erwin's The Trouble with Father. Eventually, sitcoms began to divide themselves into domestic comedies and workplace comedies. The earliest domestic comedies include "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet", "The Honeymooners", and "Make Room for Daddy". The earliest workplace comedies include "Our Miss Brooks" and "Mr. Peepers", both set in high schools, and "The Phil Silvers Show", set on a U.S. Army post.
"I Love Lucy".
"I Love Lucy" brought a new way of filming sitcoms, with Desi Arnaz, the early innovator in the history of sitcoms, who is credited with the first successful use of the multiple-camera setup, where three cameras shoot the action on stage simultaneously and the best shots from each of the cameras are later edited together. The show starred Lucille Ball (Lucy Ricardo) with her husband Desi Arnaz (Ricky Ricardo). They created it together with actors Vivian Vance (Ethel Mertz) and William Frawley (Fred Mertz), and a creative writing team. "I Love Lucy" was also among the first to record all multiple-camera episodes on film. With their Desilu Productions studio company, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz are credited with foreseeing the viability and prosperity of the rerun television program series.
1960s.
A trend beginning in the 1960s was the expansion of the domestic comedy beyond the nuclear family or married couple. "The Andy Griffith Show" and "My Three Sons" featured widowers and their children. "The Dick Van Dyke Show" was notable for combining elements of the domestic comedy with the workplace, as stories followed Rob Petrie at home and at the office. Incidentally, this was one of the few sitcoms of the era shot with multiple cameras in front of a live audience.
By the mid-1960s, sitcom creators began adding more fantastical elements to live action sitcoms in the so-called "high concept" style. The regular characters of "The Munsters" were modelled on the Universal Monsters and the eccentric "The Addams Family" sprang from a series of cartoon comics. Genies and witches featured in "I Dream of Jeannie" and "Bewitched", respectively. Sherwood Schwartz created "Gilligan's Island" about seven stranded castaways including a movie star, a millionaire, and a professor. "The Monkees" was about a fictional pop group. "Get Smart" was a spy genre parody series, "Batman" a camp series based on a comic book, and "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." was an "Andy Griffith Show" spinoff about a man from a small town in North Carolina who joins the United States Marine Corps, named Gomer Pyle. Paul Henning and Jay Sommers worked together on three sister series: "The Beverly Hillbillies", "Petticoat Junction", and "Green Acres". These three shows often crossed-over into one another and shared characters. "Green Acres" and "Petticoat Junction" characters both lived in the same farming village of Hooterville so they shared the characters of Uncle Joe Carson (Edgar Buchanan), Fred Ziffel (Hank Patterson) and Lisa Douglas (Eva Gabor). In fact, Sam Drucker (Frank Cady) was a main character on both shows. The reason "Petticoat Junction" and "The Beverly Hillbillies" crossed-over was because Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet), the main character on "Petticoat Junction" until her death, was related to Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), the star of "The Beverly Hillbillies".
Sitcom production of the 1960s mainly used the single camera filming style, which was more practical given the visual effects used in these shows. This allowed for the careful creation of special effects and sharp editing, features which were not possible with the same finesse in a multi-camera production. Many of these programs were not filmed before live audiences, and featured a laugh track.
The science fiction sitcom was born during this period with "My Favorite Martian", which began airing in 1963.
1970s.
In the early 1970s sitcoms continued to focus on family life with "The Brady Bunch" and "The Partridge Family" as prime examples, and largely returned to the three-camera shoot before live audiences. Many programs of this era were recorded on videotape as opposed to film. About half of the sitcoms on broadcast television airing between the mid-1970s and the late 1990s were shot on video.
In the US Norman Lear often used the sitcom format to address social issues through his series "All in the Family" (based on Johnny Speight's "Till Death Us Do Part") and its spin-offs "Maude", "The Jeffersons", and "Good Times", all in the US. In Britain, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson's "Steptoe and Son" aired at this time, which had an US remake in "Sanford and Son". In a major departure from earlier American sitcoms, these programs also had racially diverse casts.
Women's liberation was the backdrop in a series of female-led sitcoms produced by Grant Tinker: "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", and its spin-offs "Rhoda" and "Phyllis".
The topic of war was addressed in the sitcom "M*A*S*H". The producers of "M*A*S*H" did not want a laugh track on the show, arguing that the show did not need one, and moreover that there was no laugh track on the actual Korean War, but CBS disagreed. CBS compromised by permitting the producers of the show to omit recorded laughter from scenes that took place in the operating room, if they wished. When it was shown in the UK and Germany, episodes were broadcast without the laugh track. Ross Bagdasarian also refused to use a laugh track in his production of "The Alvin Show", as did Jay Ward on "Rocky and Bullwinkle".
Also during this time, Bob Newhart adapted his deadpan club act for television in sitcom format with "The Bob Newhart Show", which was at once a throwback to the early vaudevillian origins of sitcoms and a harbinger of the 1980s - 1990s stand-up comedian sitcom trend.
In the mid-1970s, Garry Marshall had several huge hits in the US with his sitcoms such as "The Odd Couple", "Happy Days", "Laverne and Shirley", and "Mork and Mindy". Nostalgia for the '50s was a major theme in both "Happy Days" and "Laverne and Shirley".
Sex and titillation became a theme in the late 1970s with the UK sitcom "Man About the House" and its US remake "Three's Company". Two soap opera parodies, "Soap" and "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman", are also notable shows from this period which pushed the envelope of what was acceptable in television sitcoms.
1980s.
In the 1980s, stand-up comic Bill Cosby starred in the sitcom "The Cosby Show", which was the earliest of the current trend of successful sitcoms built around a stand-up comic's stage persona. Comedienne Roseanne Barr continued the trend in the late 1980s with her eponymous sitcom, as did Garry Shandling ("It's Garry Shandling's Show" and "The Larry Sanders Show"). More recently, Jerry Seinfeld ("Seinfeld") and Ray Romano ("Everybody Loves Raymond") have also made the transition from stand up to the small screen with self-starring sitcoms.
To some extent, many American sitcoms of the 1980s such as "Full House", "Family Ties", "Who's the Boss?", and "Growing Pains" returned to themes of family life and parent-child relationships, and centered less on the social issues that defined many 1970s sitcoms. "Cheers", a show about the local customers in a bar, focused on the evolving relationship between Sam and Diane. Long-running sitcoms, such as the "Jeffersons" and "Alice" contrast sharply between topical episodes of the 1970s and the less controversial subject matter that prevailed later in the series. By the end of the decade, a backlash emerged against the dominance of family-oriented sitcoms, with both more acerbic takes on working-class family life in "Roseanne", "Married... with Children", and "The Simpsons" as well as programming such as "Seinfeld" that focused largely on relationships between single adults. "The Golden Girls", a show about four older women sharing a home in Miami, which starred actresses who all starred in other shows before this. Bea Arthur, who starred in her own sitcom "Maude", Rue McClanahan, who co-starred with Arthur in "Maude", Betty White, who co-starred with Mary Tyler Moore in "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and with McClanahan in "Mama's Family", and Estelle Getty who did not star in any other shows, except guest appearances in shows.
By the mid-1980s, the growth of cable television, additional broadcast networks, and the success of first-run syndication meant that television audiences were fracturing. Programming could now be targeted at specific audiences rather than at a "general" or "adult" audience, and this included sitcoms too. Children were one of these audiences, and among the sitcoms made specifically for children were "Saved by the Bell" and "Clarissa Explains It All".
The 1980s also saw a few comedy drama "Dramedy" programs. Examples include "United States" and "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd". These were largely unsuccessful.
1990s.
The early 1990s saw the rebirth of the "animated sitcom", a trend which continues to this day. Most notable is "The Simpsons", the longest-running sitcom in US history. Other successful sitcoms in this subgenre include "South Park", "Futurama", "Beavis and Butt-head", "American Dad!", "Family Guy", and "King of the Hill".
This era also saw a significant return to film origination. The main reason for this was that it was seen as "future proofing" productions against any new developments such as HDTV. Programs shot on standard definition videotape in general do not convert well to HDTV, while images on 35 mm film can easily be re-scanned to any future format. In addition, recent developments in film camera and post-processing technologies had eroded the advantages of using videotape.
In the mid-1990s several sitcoms have featured ongoing story lines. "Seinfeld", one of the most popular U.S. sitcoms of the 1990s, featured story arcs. "Friends" used soap opera elements such as the end-of-season cliffhanger and gradually developing the relationships of the characters over the course of the series. "Home Improvement", "Mad About You", "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", "Frasier", "Will & Grace", "Roseanne", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "Family Matters", "The Nanny", "That '70s Show", "Harry and the Hendersons", "Becker", "Unhappily Ever After", "Boy Meets World", "Sabrina the Teenage Witch", and "The King of Queens" are also noted for their long-term story arcs.
2000s and 2010s.
The early 2000s and later saw a rebirth of the single camera shooting style for half-hour sitcoms, with shows such as "Curb Your Enthusiasm", "Arrested Development", "Scrubs", "Malcolm in the Middle", "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", "Louie", "30 Rock" and "Community". Recently, a pastiche from the UK has been utilized in American sitcoms, as many are being shot as a pseudo-documentary (aka mockumentary), such as "The Office", "Modern Family", and "Parks and Recreation".
Newer sitcoms that still used a multiple camera setup (before live audiences) include "How I Met Your Mother", "Gary Unmarried", "Mike & Molly", "Rules of Engagement", "$h*! My Dad Says", "Life with Bonnie", "According to Jim", "The New Adventures of Old Christine", "iCarly", "Two and a Half Men", "Victorious", "Yes, Dear", "The Big Bang Theory", "Sam & Cat", "2 Broke Girls", "Anger Management", and "Melissa & Joey".
Definition of "Sitcom" in the 21st century.
Modern critics have disagreed over the utility of the term "sitcom" in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century. Certain individuals have raised the point that the shows in existence when the terminology "situational comedy" arose were highly invariant and aptly categorized as such. As a result, describing some modern shows (e.g., "Louie", "Curb Your Enthusiasm") as "sitcoms" can generate some false expectations. It has been proposed that one-camera setup shows would be better served to be removed from the sitcom classification and described in a taxonomy at the same level of sitcom as another type of comedy instead.

Transformers (board game)

Transformers is a 1986 board game, based upon the Transformers toyline by Hasbro.
Rules.
"Transformers" is a race-style game for two to four players. Each player has three transforming robots as game counters. These robots transform from spaceships to robots. At the start of the game, all counters are placed in the start square, in spaceship mode. Each player is also dealt five cards, bearing numbers and pictures of various Transformers: 1 is Motormaster, 2 is Silverbolt, 3 is Cyclonus, 4 is Defensor and 5 is Galvatron.
On a player's turn, he/she throws the dice and moves one of his/her counters. When two counters of opposing players land on the same square, a fight ensues. The fight is carried out with cards. Both players place a card face up on the table. The player with the higher card wins. On a draw, the fight is repeated. The losing counter transforms into spaceship mode (if not already) and moves back to the start square, while the winning counter transforms into robot mode (if not already) and stays in place. The players then replenish their cards. The only exceptions are certain "safe" squares on the board, where fights do not happen.
The player who first gets all three of his/her counters in robot mode to the special energised square at the end of the board wins.
Availability.
The game was released by The Milton Bradley Company (Also known as MB Games) in the mid-80's when the Transformers franchise was at its peak. 
The game was released in at least the following countries:

İhsan Hakan

İhsan Hakan (1965, Ankara–1 November 1993, Ankara), also known as Mustafa Deniz, was a PKK defector who was killed, according to some as part of a cover-up of the suspected assassination of general Eşref Bitlis, in a mysterious plane crash.
Controversy.
A so-called "repentant militant" (i.e., defector of the PKK) and PKK informer, Hakan was given the code name "Mustafa Deniz" and assumed a new existence. In June 1993 he co-founded an Ankara-based film and video company.
On 1 November 1993 he disappeared, and on 4 November his corpse was found in the vicinity of Avcılar Village of Polatlı District of Ankara, shot dead by a bullet to his head, while the bodies of gendarmerie commander Cem Ersever and his girlfriend Nevval Boz were found elsewhere.

Tree pangolin

The tree pangolin ("Manis tricuspis") is one of eight extant species of pangolins ("scaly anteaters"), and is native to equatorial Africa. Also known as the white-bellied pangolin or three-cusped pangolin, it is the most common of the African forest pangolins.
Taxonomy.
The tree pangolin belongs to the subgenus "Phataginus", and some authorities elevate "Phataginus" to genus status. Two subspecies were recognized in 1972 by Meester:
Range and habitat.
The tree pangolin ranges from Guinea through Sierra Leone and much of West Africa to Central Africa as far east as extreme southwestern Kenya and northwestern Tanzania. To the south, it extends to northern Angola and northwestern Zambia. It has been found on the Atlantic island of Bioko, but no records confirm a presence in Senegal, Gambia, or Guinea-Bissau.
The tree pangolin is semiarboreal and generally nocturnal. It is found in lowland tropical moist forests (both primary and secondary), as well as savanna/forest mosaics. It probably adapts to some degree to habitat modification, as it favours cultivated and fallow land where it is not aggressively hunted (e.g., abandoned or little-used oil palm trees in secondary growth).
Behavior.
The tree pangolin can walk on all fours or on its hind legs using its prehensile tail for balance. It can climb up trees in the absence of branches. When walking on all fours, it walks on its front knuckles with its claws tucked underneath to protect them from wearing down. Its anal scent glands disperse a foul secretion much like a skunk when threatened. It has a well-developed sense of smell, but, as a nocturnal animal, it has poor eyesight. Instead of teeth, it has a gizzard-like stomach full of stones and sand it ingests. The tree pangolin in Africa fills its stomach with air before entering water to aid in buoyancy for well-developed swimming.
The tree pangolin has many adaptations. When threatened, it rolls up into a ball, protecting itself with its thick skin and scales. Its scales cover its entire body except for the belly, snout, eyes, ears, and undersides of the limbs. When a mother with young is threatened, it rolls up around the young, which also roll into a ball. While in a ball, it can extend its scales and make a cutting action by using muscles to move the scales back and forth. It makes an aggressive huff noise when threatened, but that is the extent of its noise-making.
Diet.
The tree pangolin eats insects such as ants and termites from their nests, or the armies of insects moving on the trees. It relies on its thick skin for protection, and digs into burrows with its long, clawed forefeet. It eats between 5 and 7 ounces (150 to 200 g) of insects a day. The pangolin uses its 10- to 27-in (250- to 700-mm) tongue which is coated with gummy mucus to funnel the insects into its mouth. The tongue is actually sheathed in the chest cavity all the way to the pelvic area.
Reproduction.
Female pangolin territories are solitary and small, less than 10 acres (40,000 m2), and they rarely overlap. Males have larger territories, up to 60 acres (200,000 m2), which overlap many female territories, resulting in male/female meetings. These meetings are brief unless the female is in estrus, when mating occurs. Gestation of young lasts 150 days, and one young per birth is normal. The young pangolin is carried on its mother's tail until it is weaned after three months, but it will remain with its mother for five months in total. At first, the newborn's scales are soft, but, after a few days, they start to harden. In captivity, females have been known to adopt the young of others.
Economic uses.
The tree pangolin is subject to widespread and often intensive exploitation for bushmeat and traditional medicine, and is by far the most common of the pangolins found in African bushmeat markets. Conservationists believe this species has undergone a decline of 20-25% over the past 15 years (three pangolin generations) due mainly to the impact of the bushmeat hunting. They assert it continues to be harvested at unsustainable levels in some of its range and have recently elevated its status from "Least Concern" to "Near Threatened".

Comedy

Comedy (from the , "kōmōidía"), in the contemporary meaning of the term, is any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or to amuse by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film and stand-up comedy. This sense of the term must be carefully distinguished from its academic one, namely the comic theatre, whose Western origins are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre can be simply described as a dramatic performance which pits two societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye famously depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", but this dichotomy is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation. A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.
Satire and political satire use ironic comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor. Satire is a type of comedy. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, using certain ironic changes to critique those forms from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). Screwball comedy derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. Black comedy is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or evil elements in human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways. A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.
Etymology.
[[File:TragicComicMasksHadriansVillamosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of <noinclude>Ancient Greek Theatre
represented in the Hadrian's Villa mosaic.]]
The word "comedy" is derived from the Classical Greek κωμῳδία "kōmōidía", which is a compound either of κῶμος "kômos" (revel) or κώμη "kṓmē" (village) and ᾠδή "ōidḗ" (singing); it is possible that "κῶμος" itself is derived from "κώμη", and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός "kōmikós)," which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking". Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin "comoedia" and Italian "commedia" and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.
Greeks and Romans confined the word "comedy" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. In the Middle Ages, the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense Dante used the term in the title of his poem, "La Commedia". As time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter. During the Middle Ages, the term "comedy" became synonymous with satire, and later humour in general, after Aristotle's "Poetics" was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and Islamic philosophers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as "hija" (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troublous beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term "comedy" thus gained a more general semantic meaning in medieval literature.
In the late 20th century, emerged among scholars the tendency to pragmatically prefer the term "laughter" to comprehensively refer to the whole gamut of the comic, to avoid the classification in ambiguous and problematically defined genres and fields like humour, grotesque, irony, and satire.
History.
Dionysiac origins and Aristophanes.
Starting from 425 BCE, Aristophanes, a comic playwright and satirical author of the Ancient Greek Theater wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes developed his type of comedy from the earlier satyr plays, which were shamelessly obscene. Of the satyr plays the only surviving examples are by Euripides which are not representative of the genre. In ancient Greece, comedy originated in bawdy and ribald songs or recitations apropos of phallic processions and fertility festivals or gatherings.
Around 335 BCE, philosopher Aristotle, in his work "Poetics", stated that comedy originated in Phallic processions and the light treatment of the otherwise base and ugly. He also adds that the origins of comedy are obscure because it was not treated seriously from its inception. That said, comedy had its own Muse: Thalia.
Also in "Poetics", Aristotle defined Comedy as one of the original four genres of literature. The other three genres are tragedy, epic poetry, and lyric poetry. Literature in general is defined by Aristotle as a mimesis, or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims, and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims. A modern application of this theory would be the story the "ugly" guy who goes about things the wrong way, but in the end wins the "pretty" girl. Comedies usually also have elements of the supernatural, typically magic and, for the Ancient Greeks, the gods. Comedy includes the unrealistic in order to portray the realistic. For the Greeks, all comedies ended happily which is opposite of tragedy, which ends sadly.
In ancient Sanskrit drama.
After 200 BCE, in ancient Sanskrit drama, Bharata Muni's "Natya Shastra" defined humour ("hāsyam") as one of the nine "nava rasas", or principle "rasas" (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by "bhavas", the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each "rasa" was associated with a specific "bhavas" portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth ("hasya").
Shakespearean and Elizabethan comedy.
"Comedy", in its Elizabethan usage, had a very different meaning from modern comedy. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.
After the 19th century.
The advent of cinema in the late 19th century, and later radio and television in the 20th century broadened the access of comedians to the general public. Charlie Chaplin, through silent film, became one of the best known faces on earth. The silent tradition lived on well in to the 20th century through mime artists like Marcel Marceau, and the physical comedy of artists like Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as Bozo the Clown in the United States and Oleg Popov in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities - with Britain producing the influential Goon Show after the Second World War. American cinema has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from Laurel and Hardy, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, as well as Bob Hope during the mid-20th century, to performers like George Carlin, Robin Williams, and Eddie Murphy at the end of the century. Hollywood attracted many international talents like Canadian comics Dan Aykroyd, Jim Carrey, and Mike Myers. Among the most successful non-Hollywood comics was Australian comedian Paul Hogan in character as Crocodile Dundee. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the cinema of Hong Kong, Bollywood, and French farce.
American television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like "M*A*S*H", "Seinfeld" and The Simpsons achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including "Fawlty Towers", Monty Python, "Dad's Army", "Blackadder", and "The Office".
Australian satirist Barry Humphries, whose comic creations include the housewife and "gigastar" Dame Edna Everage, For his delivery of Dadaist and absurdist humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne Pender in 2010 as not only "the most significant theatrical figure of our time ... the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin".
Studies on the theory of the comic.
The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agreed the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus Thomas Hobbes speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.
George Meredith,
"Essay on Comedy", said that "One excellent test of the civilization of a country ... I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy; and the test of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter." Laughter is said to be the cure to being sick. Studies show that people who laugh more often get sick less.
American literary theorist Kenneth Burke writes that the “comic frame” in rhetoric is “neither wholly euphemistic, nor wholly debunking—hence it provides the charitable attitude towards people that is required for purposes of persuasion and co-operation, but at the same time maintains our shrewdness concerning the simplicities of ‘cashing in.’” The comic frame does not aim to vilify in its analysis, but rather, rebuke the stupidity and foolery of those involved in the circumstances. For Stewart and his audience, introducing coarse language into what is otherwise a serious commentary on the state of foreign relations serves to frame the segment comically, creating a serious tone underlying the comedic agenda presented by Stewart.
Forms.
Comedy may be divided into multiple genres based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered: for instance, standup comedy, improvisation, slapstick. The different forms often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the sub-genres of comedy are farce, comedy of manners, burlesque, and satire.
Some comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and satire often rigidly parody the conventions of the genre they are parodying. "The Onion" and "The Colbert Report" parody newspapers and television news shows like "The O'Reilly Factor". Meanwhile, more character-driven comedy can transcend genre and exist in both, say, film, television and books.
Performing arts.
Stand-up comedy.
Stand-up comedy is a mode of comic performance in which the performer addresses the audience directly, usually speaking in their own person rather than as a dramatic character.

Marchywka Effect

The Marchywka Effect refers to electrochemical cleaning of diamond using an electric field induced with remote electrodes.
Discovery and development.
It was first observed by accident by Mike Marchywka while trying to find a selective means to etch non-diamond carbon and fabricate simple astronomical UV detection devices. These devices required a few specific features such as clean surfaces and patterned areas of non-diamond carbon but the approach has subsequently been explored as a more general means to terminate carbon surfaces and selectively clean and etch various other materials or structures. The term "Marchywka Effect" is not used consistently and sometimes the term "bipolar surface treatment" is used as the substrate is induced to become a bipolar electrode. Various phrases such as "non-contacted electrochemical" process may also be used( see any references cited herein) or it may be mentioned as just an "electrochemical etch". 
While this is easily confused with various common electrochemical cells, and may appear to be a trivial and obvious extension of well known methods, recent patents continue to reference prior work that cites non-contactedness as a feature. The use of a low conductivity medium as used in Marchywka et al.'s original paper is sometimes noted when it is used and may produce new effects.
The apparatus to create the effect is similar to the well-known electroporation system except that the biological specimen is replaced with an inorganic substrate, although, in some cases, organic films can be etched with this process using a surfactant solution as the electrolyte.
Surface effects.
As a "non-contact" process, the effect differs from traditional electrochemical processes where carrier flow through the surface is achieved by connection to a current source with highly conductive materials such as copper wire. It is well known that materials contacted to an anode can be modified in a variety of ways including anodizing and electropolishing. Electrochemistry was quickly recognized as an important related field in the popular press once the first synthetic diamonds were made. However, the use of an induced field created by remote electrodes allows discontinuous areas on an insulating substrate to be cleaned, modified, or etched (similar to electroetching), greatly expanding the role of electrochemical methods.
The mechanism is presumed to be due to the induced field but little in the way of exhaustive analysis has been done, as the actual processes do not appear to differ from traditional approaches. For example, "identified as the ‘Marchywka Effect’ in the literature. The etching may be due to the galvanic coupling of diamond and non-diamond carbon". The applied field apparently creates directed surface modifications on polished diamond surfaces with little or no actual removal of material. This may be desirable for making various devices, or simply studying the properties of the diamond surface. The induced field deposits or replaces a single layer of some molecule and this could be thought of as a monolayer electroplating method. It has been elucidated in more fully in many works.
Earlier related approaches.
Many prior technologies exist for preparing wide-gap diamond for use in electronic devices or as a substrate for single-crystal diamond growth. The more stable forms of carbon have lower gaps and different crystal structures, and their presence must be carefully controlled. The Marchywka Effect has been characterised and compared to alternative means to create a desired surface for several applications. 
Removal of non-diamond carbon with wet chemicals had been accomplished by boiling in mixtures of sulphuric and chromic acid. When applied to a diamond substrate with an ion implantation damage profile as may be used for basic science, crystal growth, or device fabrication, the electrochemical approach makes it easier to preserve the thin film of less damaged diamond lying above the implant range, and it has been used in annealing experiments to fix the diamond after implantation damage has occurred. In some cases, thermal cycling may be an issue and selectivity to various masks may be important, so the lower temperatures and more flexible chemistry may offer benefits over prior art.
The method does not require the use of non-volatile materials such as chrome, possibly reducing contamination problems in some applications. The ability to control the etching direction and speed with an applied voltage or electrode configuration, as with electrochemical machining, gives additional capabilities not available with isotropic chemical-only approaches. Dry processing methods such as hot oxygen or plasmas can also burn off the graphite faster than the diamond, as can a simple acetylene torch. These require higher temperatures and do not have the same high selectivity that can be achieved with the electrochemical approach. 
Surface termination is often an issue with both solid state and vacuum devices, and the details of final surface band structure have been compared with alternatives in various device structures.
Applications.
While the original effort failed to produce useful products, follow-on work in Europe did produce usable astronomical detectors
but without apparent use of this technology. In other areas, however, the approach seems to be competitive, with prior art for making various end-products, since it has been used as a fabrication step for experimental devices and structures. Many groups have used the approach to grow homoepitaxial diamond and subsequently release the thin-films with a variety of "lift-off" processes. 
It has also been considered in contexts such as carbon microelectromechanical systems production and different materials applications, for example with non-contacted palladium deposition and extensions. While not citing Marchywka et al.'s original paper, these continue to cite non-contactedness as a feature,
"The electrode assembly and the conductive surface may be positioned in close proximity to, but without contacting, one another". references a much earlier patent covering related attempts to achieve non-contacted electro-etching, "The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for electrochemically processing metallic surfaces of workpieces arranged in a contact-free manner with regard to the cathode and anode[...]." 
The effect has been mentioned in passing with regard to novel devices such
as quantum coherent devices while patents on emerging uses for amorphous carbon
and
diamond thermal conductors by manufacturers of high density electronic chips reference the related lift-off technology.

Non-credible threat

A non-credible threat is a term used in game theory and economics to describe a threat in a sequential game that a "rational" player would actually not carry out, because it would not be in his best interest to do so. 
For a simple example, suppose person A walks up, carrying a bomb, to another person B. A tells B he will set off the bomb, killing them both, unless B gives him all his money. If A is rational and non-suicidal he stands nothing to gain from setting off the bomb, so his threat cannot be considered credible. On the other hand, a person in the situation of B might give A his money, fearing that A is not rational, or might even be suicidal.
A non-credible threat is made on the hope that it will be believed, and therefore the threatening undesirable action will not need to be carried out. For a threat to be credible within an equilibrium, whenever a node is reached where a threat should be fulfilled, it will be fulfilled. Those Nash equilibria that rely on non-credible threats can be eliminated through backward induction, the remaining equilibria are called Subgame perfect Nash equilibria.

Philip Long

Philip Long (died 1832) was an American colonist who remained loyal to the British government during the American War of Independence. Though his origins and early life are cloaked in mystery and debate, it is thought that by 1775, he was an active colonial loyalist. He eventually donned a uniform when he joined the King's American Regiment. After the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Long left for Canada where he was granted land by the British crown for his military service. His descendants are numerous and live all over North America today.
Early life.
Although controversial, 1742 is a likely birth year of Philip Long based on information in his death certificate in 1832 and the 1831 Census in Clair, New Brunswick. Oral history seems to point to his possible birth in Europe. He is said to be of Scottish ancestry, to have immigrated to the North American Continent in the New England area, and to have likely lived in Philadelphia. There is no documentary evidence to support this oral history at this time.
Another possible birth year of 1757 was deduced by Mgr. Lang based on oral history whereby Philip Long committed an act of bravery (for which there is documentary evidence) at the age of 18 (note: there is no documentary evidence for this age), and that he committed this act in 1775. The latter year is referenced by Philip Long in one of his letters as the year where “Since the year 1775, for my King and country …”. However, there is real uncertainty that Philip was in fact referring to the year when he committed his act of bravery. Instead, it is more likely that he was referring to the beginning of his expressed Loyalism to the Crown. The year 1757 is inconsistent with the documentary evidence uncovered to date.

A coronary occlusion is the partial or complete obstruction of blood flow in a coronary artery. This condition may cause a heart attack.
In some patients coronary occlusion causes only mild pain, tightness or vague discomfort which may be ignored: the myocardium is however damaged.
According to the Nicholas and Alexandra book, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia suffered a coronary occlusion right before he was toppled from his throne during the Russian Revolution in 1917.

Paul Hofmann

Paul Hofmann (Vienna, 20 November 1912 – 30 December 2008) was an Austrian, later American, author, journalist, linguist, and political activist. The New York Times, for whom he was a foreign correspondent, described him as fluent in German, Italian, French, and English, and having a command of several other languages that was more than passable, as well as "a broad grasp of history and diplomatic affairs and an often playful curiosity".
Biography.
Hofmann was born in Vienna, Austria on 20 November 1912. He was raised for the most part by his uncle, who was an influential Socialist. He studied law at the University of Vienna after which he became a member of the Christian Socialist Party.
In 1934 he became a travelling speaker for the Catholic Popular Federation, and after two years with the Federation, he became the chief editorial writer of one of their publications, "Die Sonntagsglocke". In the late 1930s, as Austria came under increasing pressure to submit to a union with Germany, Hofmann wrote editorials urging his country to resist the Nazi initiative. In March 1938 as German troops occupied Vienna he fled to Rome, Italy, only hours before his apartment was raided by the Gestapo.
In Rome during German occupation, he was drafted into the German Army where he worked as the interpreter for the Nazi commanders, General Rainer Stahel and General Kurt Maelzer. After contacting members of the anti-Fascist Resistance in Rome he passed them information gleaned from his work, including information about the deportation of Jews and the Ardeatine massacre. Eventually deserting, Hoffman hid with his family in a convent, and later a safe apartment. In November 1944 he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death for treason by a German military court in occupied northern Italy.
After Rome was captured by the Allies Hofmann briefly worked for the Allied Psychological Warfare Bureau as a broadcaster. After the war he served as a witness in the prosecution of General Maelzer for war crimes. Linking up with allied journalists in Rome soon after liberation Hofmann became a news assistant at The New York Times' bureau in Rome. He would continue to report for the "Times" until his retirement in 1990.
In Rome, he married Maria Anna Tratter and in 1940 they had a son, Ernesto. He also had a son with Christine Lord, Alexander Hofmann-Lord. [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/01/01/europe/EU-Italy-Obit-Hofmann.php]
After his retirement from the Times, in 1990, he wrote more than a dozen books, including, "The Seasons of Rome: A Journal", "That Fine Italian Hand", and "O Vatican! A Slightly Wicked View of the Holy See".
He died in Rome on 30 December 2008.

Biography.
Kwambai went to the Kondabilet Primary School in Marakwet East District, but dropped out at standard seven. 
He won the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale in 2002, breaking the course record by over a minute. In 2006 Kwambai won the Brescia Marathon and Beijing Marathon, which were his first two marathons. He also won the 2008 and the 2009 Saint Silvester Road Race.
He finished second at the 2008 Berlin Marathon, where Haile Gebrselassie set a new marathon world record. Kwambai's time was 2:05:36, that made him the seventh fastest ever marathon runner at the time. At the 2009 Rotterdam Marathon Kwambai again finished second (behind Duncan Kibet) in a time of 2:04:27, the third fastest ever marathon at the time. At the 2010 New York City Marathon he completed the race in 2:11:31, which brought him fifth place. He returned to defend his title at the Saint Silvester race in São Paulo but ended up in third place behind Marílson dos Santos and Barnabas Kosgei.
His first race of 2011 was the CPC Loop Den Haag, but he was off the winning pace and came sixth in a time of one hour and one second. He was among the leaders at the 2011 London Marathon by the 30 km mark, but dropped out of the race. In August he came second at the Rio de Janeiro Half Marathon, but was eighth at the Udine Half Marathon the following month, finishing well off his best in 1:02:06 hours. His season peaked in November when he took the title at the JoongAng Seoul Marathon in a time of 2:08:50 hours, despite rainy conditions. He took on the city's other major race, the Seoul International Marathon, in March 2012 and ran his best race in three years, finishing in 2:06:03 hours to take second behind Wilson Loyanae. In November he competed at the 2012 JoongAng Seoul Marathon, won it convincingly and broke the course record by 2:23 minutes, with a time of 2:05:50 hours.
He was among the fastest entrants at the 2013 Tokyo Marathon, but came fifth a minute and a half behind winner Dennis Kimetto. He was back in form in Seoul in November as he won in 2:06:25 hours for third straight victory at the race (the first person ever to do so).
Kwambai prefers road running over track and cross-country. His training partners include Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot, Martin Lel, Sammy Korir and Fred Kiprop in Eldoret and Italy. Kwambai has been coached by Gabriele Rosa and Claudio Berardelli.

<doc id="20914172" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20914172" title="Mace Windu">
Mace Windu

Mace Windu is a fictional character in the "Star Wars" universe, portrayed by actor Samuel L. Jackson in the prequel films and voiced by voice-actor Terrence C. Carson in other projects. A Jedi Master of the High Council and one of the last members of the order's upper echelons before the Galactic Republic's fall, he is the Council's primary liaison but the Clone Wars caused him to question his most firmly held beliefs.
Character conception and overview.
Several early incarnations of Mace Windu have been developed in the original "Star Wars" drafts as the narrator, Princess Leia's brother and Luke Skywalker's friend. Through the process of redrafting and copyediting, his character was removed from the original trilogy (', ' and "") but was reintroduced in 1994 when series creator George Lucas began writing the prequel trilogy.
The search for an actor to play the character ended when Samuel L. Jackson expressed his desire to be in the prequel films. Lucas then offered him the role which Jackson accepted and thus signed on but with certain stipulations on his character's portrayal. Aware that the prequel trilogy's climax would eventually call for Windu's death, one of the conditions was that his character die in a spectacular fashion, rather than being killed off ingloriously "like some punk".
According to an interview on the "Late Show with David Letterman" on May 13, 2005, the character's purple lightsaber was a personal request from Jackson to Lucas as a quid pro quo for appearing in the films, as well as a way of making the character unique and easily distinguishable. Mace Windu is the first character in the "Star Wars" film series shown to wield a lightsaber not colored blue, green or red.
Appearances.
Prequel trilogy.
Introduced in "", Mace Windu appears as the Master of the Jedi High Council. He is present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn brings Anakin Skywalker before the Council, claiming that the young slave is the "Chosen One" foretold by Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force. Windu shares the Council's concerns that the boy exhibits a great deal of fear and subsequently agrees with the body's unanimous decision to deny Qui-Gon permission to train him as a Jedi. However, following Jinn's death at the hands of Sith Lord Darth Maul, the Council reconsiders and allows Obi-Wan Kenobi to train Anakin in place of his deceased master, simultaneously conferring upon Kenobi the Jedi Knight title. Windu is present at Qui-Gon's funeral at which time he agrees with Yoda that Qui-Gon's killer was undoubtedly a Sith but states that he is not sure as to whether the defeated was the Master or merely the apprentice.
In his second film appearance in "" (set a decade later), Mace Windu has ceased to function as the ranking Master of the Jedi Council and has reverted to his former position as an ordinary (albeit greatly revered) member of that body. After a second assassination attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala, he watches with growing concern as Anakin Skywalker begins to rebel against Obi-Wan Kenobi's tutelage. Mace later tries to help the Jedi defeat the growing threat posed by the growing Separatist Alliance led by Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus). In the film's climactic scene, he leads a large group of Jedi in a battle against Dooku's droid army. During the battle, Windu kills bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for an army of clone troopers.
In his third film appearance in "" (set three years later), Mace Windu has fought in the Clone Wars for three years and during which time has come to distrust Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.
When Palpatine appoints Anakin Skywalker as his personal representative on the Jedi Council, Windu fears that the move is designed to give Palpatine a vote in Jedi affairs and casts a key vote in denying Anakin the full Jedi Master rank, later confiding to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda that he does not trust Anakin.
After Obi-Wan Kenobi kills General Grievous, Anakin informs Windu that Palpatine is in fact the Dark Lord of the Sith who masterminded the war. Acting swiftly on this terrifying revelation, Windu and fellow Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin confront Palpatine, unbeknownst to the fact that the Dark Lord was expecting such a confrontation and had prepared accordingly. Refusing to be taken into Jedi custody, the Chancellor accuses Windu of treason before brandishing his lightsaber and launching himself at the Jedi, killing all three of Mace's companions in a matter of mere seconds and engaging the Jedi Master in a lightsaber duel. Moments before Anakin enters the room, Windu kicks Palpatine in the face which causes the Sith lord to drop his lightsaber and fall onto the ground. Windu points his lightsaber at Palpatine's throat and declares the Sith defeated once and for all, whereupon Palpatine fires a barrage of Force lightning at him which is then blocked by Windu and redirected back to its source. As Palpatine's face is being severely deformed by his own reflected lightning, Palpatine begs Anakin to defend him, stating that only he is capable of saving Padmé from a premature death. Feigning exhaustion, Palpatine ceases his lightning attack and begs Anakin again. After Windu makes it clear that he intends to execute the Dark Lord, Anakin pleads with Mace not to do so, claiming that such an action would contradict the Jedi code, and that Palpatine must instead stand trial. Windu replies that Palpatine has control of both the Senate and the courts, and so to keep him alive would be far too dangerous. As Windu prepares to deliver the killing blow, Anakin intervenes and severs Windu's lightsaber hand. Casting off his illusion of weakness, Palpatine pummels Windu with another torrent of lightning and then Force pushes him out of the window, sending him falling to his death. With one of the few Jedi Masters who posed any threat to Palpatine eliminated, Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader has also been secured at the same time.
Cartoons.
In Cartoon Network's "" animated micro-series (set after "Attack of the Clones"), Mace Windu appears as a supporting character. In episodes 12 and 13 of volume one, he is shown defending the grasslands planet Dantooine against a large hovering "fortress", and over the course, he loses his lightsaber, forcing him to instead use a lethal form of unarmed combat powered by the Force. In episode 25 (the final episode), he and fellow Jedi Master Yoda help defend the planet Coruscant from an attack by General Grievous. In the midst of the battle, he realizes that the attack is a ruse to distract the Jedi from Grievous's true objective: to kidnap Palpatine. Despite being too late to save the Supreme Chancellor, the Jedi Master uses the Force to crush Grievous's chest, inflicting upon the cyborg general a wheezing, asthmatic cough, setting the stage for "Revenge of the Sith".
In his fourth film appearance "" as well as the (both set between "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith"), Mace Windu has a supporting role.
Expanded Universe.
Mace Windu appears extensively in the "Star Wars" "Expanded Universe" of novels and comic books.
Mace is the central character of Matthew Stover's novel "Shatterpoint", in which he is called to his home planet of Haruun Kal to defeat his former apprentice Depa Billaba who has turned to the dark side of the Force. The novel establishes that Windu has the unique talent of seeing "shatterpoints", or faultlines in the Force that could affect the destinies of certain individuals, and indeed the galaxy itself. It also explains that Windu is the creator and sole master of a style of lightsaber combat called Vaapad (Form VII), in which the user skirts dangerously close to the dark side — without giving into it — by actually enjoying the fight and the thrill of victory. All others who attempted to master the form either gave in to the dark side or were unable to properly master the technique. Stover also referenced these abilities in his "" novelization. It was said that without his unique style only Yoda and Dooku could match him. However, with the use of Vaapad he was the greatest swordsman of his time, able to defeat Darth Sidious in lightsaber combat which even Yoda could not achieve. He was also able to overwhelm Dooku in lightsaber combat during the battle of Boz Pity which took place between "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith".
Besides "Shatterpoint", Mace has appeared in other Expanded Universe novels, such as "Cloak of Deception, , Rogue Planet, Outbound Flight, The Cestus Deception, Jedi Trial, " and "Labyrinth of Evil".
Star Wars Transformers.
A Mace Windu action figure was added to the Star Wars Transformers toy line in 2006. It was a remold of the toy first used for Obi-Wan Kenobi, he becomes an Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor starfighter with Astromech droid R4-M6.
Reception.
IGN reported Mace Windu as the 27th top "Star Wars" character, stating that he is an important component of the series.

Sir William Ashhurst or Ashurst (26 April 1647 – 12 January 1720) was an English banker, Sheriff of London, Lord Mayor of London and Member of Parliament.
Biography.
The son of Henry Ashurst Ashurst was a member of the Corporation of London from 1678, and an alderman from 1687; he was knighted in 1687, and was Sheriff of London in 1691–1692 and Lord Mayor of London in 1693–1694.
A Whig, he represented the City of London in Parliament for three separate periods between 1689 and 1710; he was generally regarded as one of the Country Whigs, but voted with the Court Whigs against the Disbanding Bill in 1698-9.
He was a good friend of Edmund Calamy and was a nonconformist like the rest of his family, so unsurprisingly he was an active supporter of the Glorious Revolution and sat in the Convention Parliament (1689).
He was one of the founding subscribers of the Bank of England, and a Director of the bank in 1697–1700, 1701–3, 1704–6, 1707–9 and 1711–14.

Romano Amerio

Romano Amerio (June 22, 1905 in Lugano – October 4, 1997 in Lugano) was a Roman Catholic theologian and a late critic of post-Conciliar evolutions in liturgy and ecclesiology. His magnum opus is Iota Unum, a work dedicated to the study of the ruptures in Church teaching and tradition following the Second Vatican Council.
Education and Teaching.
Amerio was a Swiss Italian. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy from the Catholic University of Milan in 1927. He was a disciple of Fr. Gemelli, the founder of the University. He had studied in detail the philosophy of 17th century Italian poet Tommaso Campanella, of whose work he later became a professional scholar. He is also known for his study of Antonio Rosmini and producing a critical edition of the work of Alessandro Manzoni.
After receiving his doctorate, he taught philosophy and greco-roman classics at the Academy of Lugano in Switzerland.
Peritus at Vatican Council II.
Amerio was taken to Vatican Council as a peritus of Angelo Giuseppe Jelmini, Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Lugano and Titular Bishop of Thermae Basilicae. Since Jelmini was a member of the Central Preparatory Commission, Amerio was able to view all the schemata and write comments on behalf of Jelmini. 20 Years after the end of the Council, as he grew more and more critical of the discontinuity in doctrine and discipline promoted in the name of the Council by certain groups, he wrote "Iota Unum."
Thought.
In his writings, Amerio identifies three "syllabuses" which he says were implicitly and intellectually negated during the post-conciliar period : the encyclical Quanta Cura, condemning liberalism and masonic ideology, the decree "Lamentabili Sane Exitu" concerning radical biblical criticism, and the encyclical Humani Generis of 1950, which reproves of new ecclesial anthropologies and ecclesiologies.
Amerio was also opposed to liturgical "creativity", and his thought on this issue was essentially in line with the encyclical Mediator Dei of Pius XII, which precisely held that liturgy was a "cultus", and not so much a self-celebration. Amerio also examined institutional changes in the Holy Office and felt that the formal abandonment of the term "heresy" in official enquiries and procedures had dramatic consequences on Church life, studies and Christian academics. 
Amerio was a promoter of apologetics and was dismayed by the abandonment of notions of conversion and disputation in favour of a purely dialectic approach between Church and World. He held to traditional Thomism and Augustinianism and deeply disliked the common embrace of Kantism, Hegelianism and Spinozism among many Christian intellectuals. 
Amerio's essays were praised by traditional scholars in the Church, although they came at a difficult time for him because of the then public conflict between archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X and Pope Paul VI. As such, his 1980s research and books were largely ignored and neglected by leaders inside the institutional Church. Amerio died in 1997.
However, Amerio is thought to have been at least partially rehabilitated during the papacy of Benedict XVI, who along with the liturgist Klaus Gamber, promoted a hermeneutic of continuity which he felt was more attuned to the Church's historic and cultural heritage. And as such, Caritas in Veritate, a 2009 encyclical dedicated to Charity and Truth, explores ideas and concepts that were at the very heart of Amerio's theological and philosophical career.

César Gemayel

César Gemayel (b. Ain al Touffaha near Bikfaya, Lebanon in 1898 died in Beirut, Lebanon in 1958) was a famous Lebanese painter.
Gemayel was taught arts by Khalil Saleeby. He was considered as a leading and pioneering figure alongside painters like Youssef Howayek, Douad Corm, Omar Onsi, Saliba Douaihy, Moustafa Farroukh and a handful of others. 
Gemayel was a pre-eminently sensual artist. His themes - the female nude, glowing flowers, landscapes green and red, dances and "dabkés", the occasional epic evocation - are the product of his thirst for living expressed through painting. 
In 1943, Gemayel and Alexis Boutros founded the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts () also known as ALBA.
The artist is portrayed on a Lebanese airmail stamp issued in 1974 in recognition of his work.

<doc id="20914362" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20914362" title="Lombardstown">
Lombardstown

Lombardstown () is a village seven miles from the town of Mallow in County Cork, Ireland. It takes its name from the Lombard family who came to Ireland from Lombardy in Northern Italy in the Middle Ages and became rich and prominent, with branches of the family in Waterford and Cork.
It has a Co-op and a post office. Its main employer is the mill. For generations many locals used to gather at this mill while waiting for their supply of flour to be dispatched. This gave these locals the opportunity to discuss the features and benefits of the flours as they waited for their flour to be processed and bagged. To this day the locals still use the popular saying ...' I baked that from the mill '... when discussing the fruits of their baking. The iced cherry bun is a favourite locally and beyond.
Notable People.
From 1912 the world-famous Irish tenor, John McCormack spent many summers in the area after he purchased a small cottage outside the village. McCormack became a regular face in the local train station as this was his mode of transport for his journey from Athlone to Lombardstown. It was very common for locals to gather outside McCormacks cottage to hear him practice his performances, diction and breath control. In 1918 Mccormack sold this cottage as he no longer had time to travel to Cork due to his singing commitments in the US, but he left with a huge fondness of the people.

Back Roads to Cold Mountain

Back Roads to Cold Mountain is a 2004 compilation album released by Smithsonian Folkways. The album was released in the wake of the award winning soundtrack to the film Cold Mountain, and is composed of Appalachian folk music recordings compiled by musicologist John Cohen in Appalachia.
The album was released in 2004, and the material was recorded between 1944 and 2002. The recordings vary from traditional songs recorded by well-known artists, such as Wayfaring Stranger by Bill Monroe, to obscure field recordings. There is also a Sacred Harp track.
Thom Jurek of Allmusic says the album is "one of true Otherness, where dislocation, quark strangeness, and untamed spirits gather in order to whisper, cry, moan, shout and laugh in a language that has not so much died as disappeared" and is "essential listening for anyone interested in authentic American roots music".
Liner notes by Charles Frazier, author of "Cold Mountain", and Cohen are included as well.

Paulus Vallius

Paulus Vallius (Paolo Valla, Paulus Valla, Paulus de la Valle, Paulus de Valle) (1561-1622) was an Italian Jesuit logician.
Life.
He was born in Rome.
He was a lecturer at the Collegio Romano in the 1580s. He first taught "De elementis", from 1585 to 1587, and then the three-year philosophy course from 1587 to 1590. After that he taught at Padua.
His notes on the "Posterior Analytics", generally Thomist, were used by Galileo. This occurred around 1588-1590, and it was through Vallius that Galileo learned the work of Jacopo Zabarella. It is now accepted that Vallius is the source of two logical treatises by Galileo.
Vallius was plagiarized by Ludovico Carbone, in his 1597 "Additamenta ad commentaria doctoris Francisci Toleti in logicam Aristotelis", which were Additions to the logic of Franciscus Toletus.
Works.
He published "Logica", in two volumes, at Lyon in 1622. In it he sided with Benedictus Pereyra against Giuseppe Biancani. The issue was mathematical proof in physics, where Pereyra denied mathematics an essential status.

Lateral computing

Lateral computing is a lateral thinking approach to solving computing problems.
Lateral thinking has been made popular by Edward de Bono. This thinking technique is applied to generate creative ideas and solve problems. Similarly, by applying lateral-computing techniques to a problem, it can become much easier to arrive at a computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, efficient, innovative or unconventional solution.
The traditional or conventional approach to solving computing problems is to either build mathematical models or have an IF- THEN -ELSE structure. For example, a brute-force search is used in many chess engines, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes may arrive at poor solutions. It is for problems like this that lateral computing can be useful to form a better solution.
A simple problem of truck backup can be used for illustrating lateral-computing. This is one of the difficult tasks for traditional computing techniques, and has been efficiently solved by the use of fuzzy logic (which is a lateral computing technique). Lateral-computing sometimes arrives at a novel solution for particular computing problem by using the model of how living beings, such as how humans, ants, and honeybees, solve a problem; how pure crystals are formed by annealing, or evolution of living beings or quantum mechanics etc.
Logical thinking and artificial intelligence.
Chess position analysis can be used to illustrate the logical thinking. The following board position describes a chess problem which has to be solved with two moves.
The white has several options to make a move and checkmate the black. The move Rd5 × Rd7 or Rf7 × Rd7 will immediately provide material advantage to white. There are similar moves which capture pieces and provide immediate material advantages to the white. But a knight move Nc6 which does not provide any material advantage, provides a solution for checkmate for black in two moves.
This is an example which illustrates the use of logical thinking. The logical thinking in chess progresses by evaluating the immediate material gain in each move. This will result in a solution which will require more number of moves or failure to checkmate. However, the not so obvious move of knight results in a very powerful checkmate. Even though this move does not look logical, it is the solution to two-move checkmate problem. A computer programmed to play chess might miss out some good opportunities if it does a material-based search to find moves. Several attempts have been made to build the powerful chess computers in history. But these chess computers have been defeated by Grandmaster human chess players.
Logic programming.
The attempts to use logic programming such as prolog to represent knowledge and build artificial intelligent systems has not provided the anticipated thrust to solving interesting problems. The lack of generalization and learning capability of these systems and exponential growth of the IF-THEN ELSE rules has made this approach unpopular. An example to illustrate the failure of the rule-based system is the following flawed proof:
This would imply that 4 = 5, which a wrong result. While taking the square roots, the step of considering the signs has been missed. This has resulted in an absurd outcome. A rule-based system, even if it missed a simple rule in its database may yield such an unacceptable output.
Another interesting mathematical proof gone wrong is as follows:
If a = 1, then we get an absurd result of 1 = 2
From lateral-thinking to lateral-computing.
Lateral thinking is technique for creative thinking for solving problems. The brain as center of thinking has a self-organizing information system. It tends to create patterns and traditional thinking process uses them to solve problems. The lateral thinking technique proposes to escape from this patterning to arrive at better solutions through new ideas. Provocative use of information processing is the basic underlying principle of lateral thinking,
The provocative operator (PO) is something which characterizes lateral thinking. Its function is to generate new ideas by provocation and providing escape route from old ideas. It creates a provisional arrangement of information.
Water logic is contrast to traditional or rock logic. Water logic has boundaries which depends on circumstances and conditions while rock logic has hard boundaries. Water logic, in someways, resembles fuzzy logic.
Transition to lateral-computing.
Lateral computing does a provocative use of information processing similar to lateral-thinking. This is explained with the use of evolutionary computing which is a very useful lateral-computing technique. The evolution proceeds by change and selection. While random mutation provides change, the selection is through survival of the fittest. The random mutation works as a provocative information processing and provides a new avenue for generating better solutions for the computing problem.
Lateral-computing takes the analogies from real world examples such as:
Differentiating factors of "lateral computing":
Convention – lateral.
It is very hard to draw a clear boundary between conventional and lateral computing. Over a period of time, some unconventional computing techniques become integral part of mainstream computing. So there will always be an overlap between conventional and lateral computing. It will be tough task classifying a computing technique as a conventional or lateral computing technique as shown in the figure. The boundaries are fuzzy and one may approach with fuzzy sets.
Formal definition.
Lateral computing is a fuzzy set of all computing techniques which use unconventional computing approach. Hence Lateral computing includes those techniques which use semi-conventional or hybrid computing. The degree of membership for lateral computing techniques is greater than 0 in the fuzzy set of unconventional computing techniques.
The following brings out some important differentiators for lateral computing.
Lateral computing and parallel computing.
Parallel computing focuses on improving the performance of the computers/algorithms through the use of several computing elements (such as processing elements). The computing speed is improved by using several computing elements. Parallel computing is an extension of conventional sequential computing. However, in lateral computing, the problem is solved using unconventional information processing whether using a sequential or parallel computing.
A review of lateral-computing techniques.
There are several computing techniques which fit the Lateral computing paradigm. Here is a brief description of some of the Lateral Computing techniques:
Swarm intelligence.
Swarm intelligence (SI) is the property of a system whereby the collective behaviors of (unsophisticated) agents, interacting locally with their environment, cause coherent functional global patterns to emerge. SI provides a basis with which it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model.
One interesting swarm intelligent technique is the Ant Colony algorithm:
Agent-based systems.
Agents are encapsulated computer systems that are situated in some environment and are capable of flexible, autonomous action in that environment in order to meet their design objectives. Agents are considered to be autonomous (independent, not-controllable), reactive (responding to events), pro-active (initiating actions of their own volition), and social (communicative). Agents vary in their abilities: they can be static or mobile, or may or may not be intelligent. Each agent may have its own task and/or role. Agents, and multi-agent systems, are used as a metaphor to model complex distributed processes. Such agents invariably need to interact with one another in order to manage their inter-dependencies. These interactions involve agents cooperating, negotiating and coordinating with one another.
Agent-based systems are computer programs that try to simulate various complex phenomena via virtual "agents" that represent the components of a business system. The behaviors of these agents are programmed with rules that realistically depict how business is conducted. As widely varied individual agents interact in the model, the simulation shows how their collective behaviors govern the performance of the entire system - for instance, the emergence of a successful product or an optimal schedule. These simulations are powerful strategic tools for "what-if" scenario analysis: as managers change agent characteristics or "rules," the impact of the change can be easily seen in the model output
Grid computing.
By analogy, a computational grid is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive access to high-end computational capabilities. The applications of grid computing are in:
Autonomic computing.
The autonomic nervous system governs our heart rate and body temperature, thus freeing our conscious brain from the burden of dealing with these and many other low-level, yet vital, functions. The essence of autonomic computing is self-management, the intent of which is to free system administrators from the details of system operation and maintenance.
Four aspects of autonomic computing are:
This is a grand challenge promoted by IBM.
Optical computing.
Optical computing is to use photons rather than conventional electrons for computing. There are quite a few instances of optical computers and successful use of them. The conventional logic gates use semiconductors, which use electrons for transporting the signals. In case of optical computers, the photons in a light beam are used to do computation.
There are numerous advantages of using optical devices for computing such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, large bandwidth, etc.
DNA computing.
DNA computing uses strands of DNA to encode the instance of the problem and to manipulate them using techniques commonly available in any molecular biology laboratory in order to simulate operations that select the solution of the problem if it exists.
Since the DNA molecule is also a code, but is instead made up of a sequence of four bases that pair up in a predictable manner, many scientists have thought about the possibility of creating a molecular computer. These computers rely on the much faster reactions of DNA nucleotides binding with their complements, a brute force method that holds enormous potential for creating a new generation of computers that would be 100 billion times faster than today's fastest PC. DNA computing has been heralded as the "first example of true nanotechnology", and even the "start of a new era", which forges an unprecedented link between computer science and life science.
Example applications of DNA computing are in solution for the Hamiltonian path problem which is a known NP complete one. The number of required lab operations using DNA grows linearly with the number of vertices of the graph. Molecular algorithms have been reported that solves the cryptograhic problem in a polynomial number of steps. As known, factoring large numbers is a relevant problem in many cryptographic applications.
Quantum computing.
In a quantum computer, the fundamental unit of information (called a quantum bit or qubit), is not binary but rather more quaternary in nature. This qubit property arises as a direct consequence of its adherence to the laws of quantum mechanics, which differ radically from the laws of classical physics. A qubit can exist not only in a state corresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical bit, but also in states corresponding to a blend or quantum superposition of these classical states. In other words, a qubit can exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with a numerical coefficient representing the probability for each state. A quantum computer manipulates qubits by executing a series of quantum gates, each a unitary transformation acting on a single qubit or pair of qubits. In applying these gates in succession, a quantum computer can perform a complicated unitary transformation to a set of qubits in some initial state.
Reconfigurable computing.
Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are making it possible to build truly reconfigurable computers. The computer architecture is transformed by on the fly reconfiguration of the FPGA circuitry. The optimal matching between architecture and algorithm improves the performance of the reconfigurable computer. The key feature is hardware performance and software flexibility.
For several applications such as fingerprint matching, DNA sequence comparison, etc., reconfigurable computers have been shown to perform several orders of magnitude better than conventional computers.
Simulated annealing.
The Simulated annealing algorithm is designed by looking at how the pure crystals form from a heated gaseous state while the system is cooled slowly. The computing problem is redesigned as a simulated annealing exercise and the solutions are arrived at. The working principle of simulated annealing is borrowed from metallurgy: a piece of metal is heated (the atoms are given thermal agitation), and then the metal is left to cool slowly. The slow and regular cooling of the metal allows the atoms to slide progressively their most stable ("minimal energy") positions. (Rapid cooling would have "frozen" them in whatever position they happened to be at that time.) The resulting structure of the metal is stronger and more stable. By simulating the process of annealing inside a computer program, it is possible to find answers to difficult and very complex problems. Instead of minimizing the energy of a block of metal or maximizing its strength, the program minimizes or maximizes some objective relevant to the problem at hand.
Soft computing.
One of the main components of "Lateral-computing" is soft computing which approaches problems with human information processing model. The Soft Computing technique comprises Fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary-computing, machine learning and probabilistic-chaotic computing.
Neuro computing.
Instead of solving a problem by creating a non-linear equation model of it, the biological neural network analogy is used for solving the problem. The neural network is trained like a human brain to solve a given problem. This approach has become highly successful in solving some of the pattern recognition problems.
Evolutionary computing.
The genetic algorithm (GA) resembles the natural evolution to provide a universal optimization. Genetic algorithms start with a population of chromosomes which represent the various solutions. The solutions are evaluated using a fitness function and a selection process determines which solutions are to be used for competition process. These algorithms are highly successful in solving search and optimization problems. The new solutions are created using evolutionary principles such as mutation and crossover.
Fuzzy logic.
Fuzzy logic is based on the fuzzy sets concepts proposed by Lotfi Zadeh. The degree of membership concept is central to fuzzy sets. The fuzzy sets differ from crisp sets since they allow an element to belong to a set to a degree (degree of membership). This approach finds good applications for control problems. The Fuzzy logic has found enormous applications and has already found a big market presence in consumer electronics such as washing machines, microwaves, mobile phones, Televisions, Camcoders etc.
Probabilistic/chaotic computing.
Probabilistic computing engines, e.g. use of probabilistic graphical model such as Bayesian network. Such computational techniques are referred to as randomization, yielding probabilistic algorithms. When interpreted as a physical phenomenon through classical statistical thermodynamics, such techniques lead to energy savings that are proportional to the probability p with which each primitive computational step is guaranteed to be correct (or equivalently to the probability of error, (1–p). Chaotic Computing is based on the chaos theory.
Fractals.
Fractal Computing are objects displaying self-similarity at different scales. Fractals generation involves small iterative algorithms. The fractals have dimensions greater than their topological dimensions. The length of the fractal is infinite and size of it cannot be measured. It is described by an iterative algorithm unlike a Euclidean shape which is given by a simple formula. There are several types of fractals and Mandelbrot sets are very popular.
Fractals have found applications in image processing, image compression music generation, computer games etc. Mandelbrot set is a fractal named after its creator. Unlike the other fractals, even though the Mandelbrot set is self-similar at magnified scales, the small scale details are not identical to the whole. I.e., the Mandelbrot set is infinitely complex. But the process of generating it is based on an extremely simple equation. The Mandelbrot set "M" is a collection of complex numbers. The numbers "Z" which belong to "M" are computed by iteratively testing the Mandelbrot equation. "C" is a constant. If the equation converges for chosen "Z", then "Z" belongs to "M".
Mandelbrot equation:
Randomized algorithm.
A Randomized algorithmmakes arbitrary choices during its execution. This allows a savings in execution time at the beginning of a program. The disadvantage of this method is the possibility that an incorrect solution will occur. A well-designed randomized algorithm will have a very high probability of returning a correct answer. The two categories of randomized algorithms are:
Consider an algorithm to find the "k"th element of an array. A deterministic approach would be to choose a pivot element near the median of the list and partition the list around that element. The randomized approach to this problem would be to choose a pivot at random, thus saving time at the beginning of the process. Like approximation algorithms, they can be used to more quickly solve tough NP-complete problems. An advantage over the approximation algorithms, however, is that a randomized algorithm will eventually yield an exact answer if executed enough times
Machine learning.
Human beings/animals learn new skills, languages/concepts. Similarly, machine learning algorithms provide capability to generalize from training data. There are two classes of Machine Learning (ML):
One of the well known machine learning technique is Back Propagation Algorithm. This mimics how humans learn from examples. The training patters are repeatedly presented to the network. The error is back propagated and the network weights are adjusted using gradient decent. The network converges through several hundreds of iterative computations.
Support vector machines.
This is another class of highly successful machine learning techniques successfully applied to tasks such as text classification, speaker recognition, image recognition etc.
Example applications.
There are several successful applications of lateral-computing techniques. Here is a small set of applications that illustrates lateral computing:
Summary.
Above is a review of lateral-computing techniques. Lateral-computing is based on the lateral-thinking approach and applies unconventional techniques to solve computing problems. While, most of the problems are solved in conventional techniques, there are problems which require lateral-computing. Lateral-computing provides advantage of computational efficiency, low cost of implementation, better solutions when compared to conventional computing for several problems. The lateral-computing successfully tackles a class of problems by exploiting tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. Lateral-computing techniques which use the human like information processing models have been classified as "Soft Computing" in literature.
Lateral-computing is valuable while solving numerous computing problems whose mathematical models are unavailable. They provide a way of developing innovative solutions resulting in smart systems with Very High Machine IQ (VHMIQ). This article has traced the transition from lateral-thinking to lateral-computing. Then several lateral-computing techniques have been described followed by their applications. Lateral-computing is for building new generation artificial intelligence based on unconventional processing.

Caherconree

Caherconree () is a mountain peak on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. At 835 m (2,740 ft), it is the second-highest peak of the Slieve Mish Mountains and the 26th highest on the island of Ireland.
Geography.
Caherconree is linked to Baurtregaum (851 m), to the east, by a narrow ridge. There are two deep glens either side of this. North of Caherconree's summit is the long narrow mountain called Gearhane ("an Géarán").
Caherconree in myth.
Caherconree is named after a stone ringfort that sits two-thirds of the way up its southwestern shoulder, overlooking the mountain road called "Bóthar na gCloch" ("road of the stones"). The ringfort is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs. In Irish mythology this is the fort of Cú Roí mac Dáire, who was able to make it spin around at night to stop any attackers from finding the entrance. In the story of "Aided Con Roí", a king's daughter called Bláthnat is kidnapped and taken to the fort by Cú Roí. She is rescued by her lover, Cú Chulainn. Bláthnat signals to Cú Chulainn that the time is right to attack by pouring milk in a stream. This stream is now called the Finglas (from "an Fhionnghlaise" meaning "the white stream") and its source is close to the remains of the ringfort.
There is a rock feature on the mountain called Fin MacCool's Chair, which is named after the mythical figure Fionn mac Cumhaill.

Charlie Hare

Charles Boyd "Charlie" Hare (June 1871 – February 1934) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward or centre forward.
Born in Yardley, Birmingham, Hare played in the Football League in the 1890s for Aston Villa, contributing to their first league title in the 1893–94 season. He was transferred to Woolwich Arsenal in February 1895 and made his debut for the Second Division side on 9 March 1895 against Leicester Fosse, which ended as a 3–3 draw. In one-and-a-half seasons at the club he was in and out of the side, mainly playing at inside forward, although he also deputised for Joe Powell at right back.
With 20 appearances and seven goals to his name at Woolwich Arsenal, in November 1896 he moved to Small Heath. He then played for Watford in the Southern League, and is joint holder of the club record for most FA Cup goals in a season, with seven in the 1899–1900 campaign. Hare served with the Warwickshire Yeomanry in South Africa during the Boer War. On his return he tried to revive his career with Plymouth Argyle in the Southern League, but with little success, and he retired from the game in 1904.

1–3–1 defense and offense

The 1–3–1 defense and offense is a popular strategy used in basketball.
The 1-3-1 zone defense is a defensive basketball formation. It was originally utilized by Hall of Fame coach Clair Bee. This defense is named for its formation since there is one defender at the point, three defenders at the free throw level, and one defender at the base line. The main focus of this defensive strategy is to force turnovers. This is done by using quick, pestering defense and anticipating any passes to attempt a steal. A two man trap is implemented in this defense. The defense attempts to guide the ball handler towards a corner and quickly close in and double team the offensive player creating a trap with the defenders and side lines. This trap often forces the ball handler to get rid of the ball prematurely taking the offense out of their set up. This often results in poor passes or shots. These poor passes are meant to be taken advantage of in this defense so the weak side defenders must anticipate passes to create turnovers.
A form of this player formation is also sometimes effective in ice hockey, as used by the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning team in the 21st century, and said to have been pioneered in ice hockey as a form of neutral zone trap by the 1990s-era New Jersey Devils.
Defense.
The defensive usage of the 1-3-1 is mostly used to create turnovers, not for protecting the paint, due to only having one player down low. They usually have two guards to double team the ball carrier.
Another variation of the 1-3-1 defense is the full court press version. The lead guard will pressure the ball in the backcourt, and also can shade over to the side and form a 2-man trap 
with a defensive player in the 3-set when an offensive guard tries to bring up the ball down the sideline. 
One effective press-break against the 1-3-1 full court press is to have either the power forward or the center to flash to midcourt and then quickly pass the weak side guard running down the sideline, not allowing the trap to be formed.
There are multiple ways to approach defense in the sport of basketball. Typically they are divided into man defenses and zone defenses. The 1-3-1 zone defense is a zone defense. It falls under this category because each player guards a specific zone within the formation. This defense is named for its formation. A picture of the formation is shown on the right. In basketball positions are numbered from one to five. One and two are guards, three and four are forwards, and five is the center in a typical basketball lineup. Guards are quick and typically are good ball handlers and shooters. Forwards usually are the most athletic and are typically taller than the guards. The center is the tallest player and specializes in close vicinity to the basket.
Canterbury School, Greensboro Day School (highschool), and Wake Forest use this type of play.
Formation.
In this formation, the one will take the top and meet the oncoming offensive guard. The two and three positions are split out on the edges of the court at free throw level, or on the wing. The four position is down beneath the basket and acts as a rover along the base line. The rover position is typically the best athlete’s position since there is the most area to defend around the basket. The five position is posted in the center of the formation at about free throw level.
Zone Responsibilities.
The goal of the 1-3-1 zone defense is to create turnovers. This defense focuses extra pressure on the ball handler and will exert more effort to force turnovers. Turnovers within this defense are created by a couple key features of this strategy. Two defensive players will try to trap the ball handler in one of the corners of the half court. In basketball the ball can only be held for five seconds before passing, shooting, or dribbling. If a player is trapped in the corner they tend to stop their dribble before making a decision to pass or shoot. This creates a problem for the offense but is exactly what the defense wants to happen. When a player is double teamed without their dribble they tend to make poor decisions. Often bad passes and shots are forced out by the player just to get the ball out of the corner. It is vital for players not guarding the ball handler to anticipate a bad pass or shot in order to make a steal or get a rebound. This will help create the most turnovers.
Each player will have their own responsibility in the zone. They each have their own area to guard on the court. Players will also shift as the ball is moved to be in better defensive position. This means moving to a better location to cut off passes and gather rebounds. Typically, the one will take the top position. They will meet the ball handler and force them in one direction while playing close defense. Based on the direction the ball handler dribbles the defender on the wing, either the two or three position, will close in on the ball handler for a double team. The intention is to force a double team quickly and drive the offensive player into a corner of the court. The double team creates a lot of free space on the court. The other three players must shift to cover this area equally during a trap. A trap can be made at any of the four corners both at the base line and at half court. The only difference is the base line is defended by the rover and they will trap with the wing instead of the one position. By forcing these double teams the offense will make long cross court passes. These passes are more likely to get stolen because they are less accurate and travel in the air longer. More space is open during a double team so the defenders not trapping must take advantage of the long passes and force any possible turnovers
Coaching Strategy.
Defensively
Coaches usually do this to throw the offense off tempo. It is thrown in to mix up the defensive look and force the offense to adjust or face flustering defensive pressure. Normally the 1-3-1 defense is used to create turnovers and is fast paced so players cannot keep it up the whole game. By applying pressure to the ballhandler the defense plans to take advantage of any mistakes forced from the pressure. The extra defensive pressure often makes the ball handler lose some composure and turn the ball over. By using this at key points in the game this strategy can change momentum, cause quick scoring shifts, and create a large enough lead to break the opponents morale. This defense is very effective if ran correctly and can take a team out of the game both physically and mentally.
Offensively
The 1-3-1 defense attempts to fluster the offensive set up. The key to beating the 1-3-1 zone is to get the defenders out of position. This is accomplished by quickly passing the ball around the perimeter. If the offense can pass the ball before the defense traps them then the defense must shift to adjust to the new ball position. As the defense shifts passing lanes open up and defenders have to rotate to stay in position. Speeding up the tempo and running fast breaks also can beat this defense. Pushing the ball quickly up the court gives the defense little time to set up the zone. If the offense can get to the basket before the zone sets up scoring can be achieved easily. The defense can easily be beaten if composure is kept and good passes are made. Issues occur when the offense is surprised by the extra pressure and is not expecting the trap that occur in basketball.

Scott Model 3S

The Scott Model 3S was a British motorcycle made by The Scott Motorcycle Company in 1938. Only eight were produced before the outbreak of World War II.
Development.
The Scott designer William Cull had been experimenting with three-cylinder two-strokes throughout the 1930s and had developed a prototype 747 cc engine. The "Scott Model 3S" which was unveiled at the 1934 Olympia Motorcycle Show was a further development of this work, with the capacity enlarged to 986 cc and a four-speed gearchange. A notable feature of the Model 3S was the lubrication system, which had a throttle-operated pump drawing oil from the sump and delivering it to a geared pump, while a separate geared pump dealt with the return. Another unusual feature was that fuel was held in 'pannier' containers each side of the rear wheel so the apparent fuel tank was actually a dummy housing the instrumentation and control box (a feature later copied by the Honda Gold Wing). Only eight were produced before the outbreak of World War II. The final Model 3S is on display at the National Motorcycle Museum (UK).

André Mba Obame

André Mba Obame (born 15 June 1957) is a Gabonese politician. After serving as an adviser to President Omar Bongo in the 1980s, he was a minister in the government of Gabon from 1990 to 1991 and again from 1997 to 2009; during that time, he was identified with the reformist wing of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG). He held the key post of Minister of the Interior from 2006 to 2009 and then briefly served as Minister of the Coordination and Follow-up of Government Action in mid-2009. He was an independent candidate in the 30 August 2009 presidential election and placed third with 25.33% of the vote.
Political career.
Mba Obame was born in Medouneu, located in northern Gabon. He was President Omar Bongo's Deputy Adviser for African and International Affairs from 1984 to 1986 and then Adviser to the President for Development and Public and Productive Investments before being appointed to the government as Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and the Rural Economy in April 1990. Subsequently he was moved to the post of Minister of Human Rights and Relations with the Assemblies in November 1990. Mba Obame was viewed as a PDG reformist in the early 1990s, along with Bongo's son Ali Bongo. A 1991 legal change sought by party leaders required that ministers be at least 35 years old, thus forcing his departure from the government, along with Ali-Ben Bongo. From 1991 to 1994, Mba Obame was Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Republic, and from 1994 to 1997 he was High Commissioner under the Minister of the Interior.
In the December 1996 parliamentary election, Mba Obame won a seat in the National Assembly as a PDG candidate in Woleu-Ntem Province; he then returned to the government as Minister of Relations with Parliament and the Assemblies, as well as Government Spokesman, on 28 January 1997. After Bongo won re-election according to the official results of the December 1998 presidential election (disputed by the opposition), Mba Obame said that "the campaign was of high quality and the Gabonese showed maturity and serenity which can only add credibility to the Gabonese political system".
Following Bongo's re-election, Mba Obame was moved to the post of Minister of National Education on 25 January 1999, while remaining Government Spokesman. In the December 2001 parliamentary election, he was re-elected to the National Assembly as a PDG candidate in Woleu-Ntem Province, and after that election he was moved from his position as Minister of National Education to that of Minister of National Solidarity, Social Affairs and Welfare on 27 January 2002. On 21 January 2006, he was promoted to the position of Minister of State for the Interior, Security and Immigration.
In the December 2006 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as the PDG candidate in Medouneu Commune. His ministerial portfolio was modified on 28 December 2007, when he was appointed as Minister of the Interior, Local Collectivities, Decentralization, Security, and Immigration (without the rank of Minister of State).
As Interior Minister, Mba Obame encountered strong criticism in the press after he reportedly proposed selling Mbiané—a small, uninhabited island lying in potentially oil-rich waters—to neighboring Equatorial Guinea.
Following the death of President Bongo on 8 June 2009, Mba Obame asserted that the presidential succession was "strictly following the constitutional route, contrary to supposition and Machiavellian plans attributed to one person or another, particularly the defence minister", a reference to the widely held belief that Ali-Ben Bongo, the Minister of Defense, was a likely successor. In the government named on 19 June 2009, he was moved to the position of Minister of the Coordination and Follow-up of Government Action. Jean-François Ndongou succeeded him at the Interior Ministry in a ceremony held on 24 June.
2009 presidential election.
Shortly after the PDG leadership chose Ali-Ben Bongo as the party's presidential candidate, Mba Obame announced in Barcelona on 17 July 2009 that he would stand as a presidential candidate himself. According to Mba Obame, he was ready to be President "after twenty-five years of learning and working closely alongside the late President Omar Bongo". He was then excluded from the government on 22 July 2009. 
Mba Obame spoke before the Confederation of Gabonese Employers on 12 August 2009, saying that if elected he would "bring order and discipline to the Gabonese administration" and that he would cooperate with Gabonese employers to "ensure that the State grants you certain facilities and protects you against unfair competition and red tape". He also addressed rumors that businessmen and foreigners were leaving the country in anticipation of post-election violence, "reassureveryone that the major concern of all 23 presidential candidates is the preservation and consolidation of peace and national unity that we inherited from the late President Omar Bongo Ondimba. There will be no trouble in Gabon."
In late August, a few days before the election, various opposition candidates gathered for negotiations and held a secret ballot to choose a joint candidate. The vote concluded early on 28 August and André Mba Obame was declared the victor. A statement was then sent to the press announcing that 11 candidates were withdrawing from the election and rallying behind Mba Obame's candidacy. However, several of the candidates—Casimir Oyé-Mba, Jules-Aristide Bourdes-Ogouliguende, Victoire Lasseni Duboze, and Bruno Ben Moubamba—promptly denied this, saying that they were still running and did not support Mba Obame. After a brief period of confusion, five candidates publicly rallied behind Mba Obame, withdrawing their own candidacies: Paul Mba Abessole, Jean Eyeghé Ndong, Mehdi Teale, Claudine Ayo Assayi, and Jean Ntoutoume Ngoua. Praising the withdrawing candidates, Mba Obame called them a "dream team" and declared that with their support he could not lose.
Despite this show of support, when the Constitutional Court announced the final, official election results on 13 October 2009, the top three candidates were Ali Bongo Ondimba with 41.79% of the vote, followed by Pierre Mamboundou (25.64%), and André Mba Obame (25.33%). In terms of raw vote totals, Ali Bongo Ondimba received 141,665 votes; Pierre Mamboundou received 86,875 votes; and André Mba Obame received 85,814 votes.
On 30 December 2009, the planned creation of a new, united opposition party was announced, and Mba Obame was among the various opposition leaders participating in it. Mba Obame joined the Gabonese Union for Democracy and Development (UGDD), a party led by Zacharie Myboto, on 6 February 2010, and the UGDD then merged with two other parties to create a unified opposition party, the National Union. At the party's launch on 10 February 2010, Mba Obame was designated as its Executive Secretary, while Myboto was designated as its President.
On 25 January 2011, Mba Obame declared himself president, citing the example of Côte d'Ivoire, where Alassane Ouattara is internationally recognised as the legitimate winner of the 2010 presidential election while incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refuses to step down. Mba Obame took refuge in a UN office in Libreville and also appointed a government of 18 ministers; in response, Bongo declared Mba Obame's National Union dissolved and Mba Obame's parliamentary mandate void.

Mid-Wales Railway

The Mid-Wales Railway (MWR) was an early railway company operating in Mid-Wales. It was a constituent part of the Cambrian Railways.
Company Formation and Parliamentary authorisation.
The company was formed in 1859 and parliamentary approval was received on 1 August for the northern section of the line from Llanidloes, Montgomeryshire to Llandovery, Carmarthenshire. Approval for the southern section from Newbridge-on-Wye to Three Cocks Junction in northern Brecknockshire was received on 3 July 1860.
Construction and opening of the railway.
The first sod was ceremonially cut on 2 September 1859, but further work on the 46.7 mile line was delayed until 1862. A formal opening ceremony was held on 23 August 1864, and the line to Three Cocks Junction was opened goods traffic on 1 September.
Parliament had authorised both the MWR and the Manchester and Milford Railway to connect Llanidloes to Aberystwyth, and so the M&MR had prioritised construction in the Llanidloes area. Eventually an agreement was reached to form the joint Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, which extended south to Pentrabane junction, where the MWR and M&MR's short-lived Llangurig branch diverged. The L&NR opened its line in 1859, enabling through working to and from the MWR line. 
The MWR worked the line of the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway from 1 October 1868 until that company was taken over by the Midland Railway on 1 October 1869. The line from Builth Road to Llandovery was not built, but a connection to the Central Wales Extension Railway was completed on 1 November 1866, enabling goods trains to run to and through that station.
Stations.
At Brecon, following the initial opening of three separate stations, a joint station was created at Free Street.
At Llanidloes railway station, the grand junction building that was created in anticipation of M&MR traffic which never materialised, since the Mid Wales Railway never completed their section of the Llangurig - Strata Florida - Aberystwyth line.
Mid Wales Line.
The Welsh Railways Through Traffic Act of 1889 went some way to formalising an arrangement to create the Mid Wales Line, to form part of a through route from South Wales to Cheshire, as an alternative to the main line route via and (i.e. Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway plus Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway) . The main route was made up of (North to South):
Southern feeder.
The links necessary to complete the route included the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway to connect to the LNWR at Crewe, and the Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway to connect to the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway and hence onwards to Liverpool. These links were not complete until 1896.
Amalgamation with Cambrian Railways.
In practice the Mid Wales Line never received substantial use, and that almost entirely for goods traffic. As a result the Mid-Wales Railway encountered financial problems, and the company's locomotives and rolling stock were sold. A working arrangement was signed with the Cambrian Railways (CamR) which took effect on 2 April 1888. Formal vesting of the line in the CamR followed on 24 June 1904.
Operations on the line.
Normal goods and passenger trains along the CR/MWRs route were stopped in World War I by intensive coal trains, dubbed "Jellicoe Specials" after the Admiral of the Fleet John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, from the South Wales Coalfield travelling north towards Scapa Flow for use by warships of the Royal Navy.
Closure.
The whole of the CR/MWR route, and its stations, from Moat Lane Junction to Talyllyn Junction were closed for passengers throughout by British Railways on 31 December 1962. The section between Moat Lane Junction and Llanidloes remained open for freight traffic until 1967.

Iskul Bukol 20 Years After

Iskul Bukol 20 Years After (Ungasis and Escaleras Adventure) is a Philippine comedy movie starring actors Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon. It is part of the Iskul Bukol franchise, depicting its characters 20 years after the end of the original TV series. It is also the fourth "Iskul Bukol" film (after 1977's "Iskul Bukol the Movie", 1980's "Iskul Bukol Freshmen", and 1987's "The Best of Iskul Bukol: The Movie").
The movie, which was a joint collaboration of APT Entertainment, MZET Films, and OctoArts Films, was one of the movies exhibited at the 2008 Metro Manila Film Festival.
Premise.
Vic Ungasis (Sotto) is an archaeologist who has recovered the Kali of Humabon and is looking for a partner sword, the Kampilan of Lapu-Lapu, plus the Peseta, one of Judas Iscariot's 30 pieces of silver which reportedly gives the bearer immortality. Upon returning home, he reunites with the Escalera brothers, who have become successful real-estate developers. However, a Yakuza who has acquired the Kampilan wants the Peseta so it could be merged with the sword for unmatched power.
Cast.
Original cast.
Many members of the show's original cast appear in the movie, aside from the three leads. They include Anthony Roquel (Tonette Macho), Mely Tagasa (Miss Tapia), Sharon Cuneta (Sharon Escalera), Redford White (Redford), Ariel Villasanta (Pekto), scriptwriter Bibeth Orteza (Bibeth), Kaye Torres (Kaye Flores), and Richard Reyes, otherwise known as Ritchie D'Horsie.
Vic Sotto said the decision to get Ritchie on the film was hard to make, considering that he, Tito Sotto, and Joey de Leon have bailed him out several times over the years on drug charges but did not change his ways. The trio stressed that the latest bailout, where they paid PHP 120,000, will be Reyes' last chance to reform. Ritchie eventually appeared on set during the last shooting day on November 11, 2008.
The role of Mang Temi was retired as a tribute to cast member Bing Angeles who died in 2001. The movie was eventually dedicated to him and series director Emmanuel "Boy" Gatus, who died in October 2008.
At the same time, certain characters were introduced as an homage to past series characters. Joey de Leon's real-life son, Keempee, plays Wympy, Joey Escalera's son by series character Patty Pulupot, a dancer at the Agogo Banana strip club. Gian Sotto, Tito Sotto's real-life son, plays Gianni, Tito Escalera's son by Pulupot's colleague, Mercy Taga. Bubble Gang mainstay Mykah appears in a short scene as Mang Temi's daughter Temita.
Development.
Vic Sotto first revealed during a 2007 episode of the GMA documentary show I-Witness that he wished to do a reunion movie with the surviving cast members of Iskul Bukol, particularly his co-hosts, Tito Sotto and Joey de Leon. He later said that after four straight Enteng Kabisote movies, it was high time that the comic trio got back together on the big screen. On July 2, 2008, Vic's film production company, M-ZET Films, submitted a script written by fellow cast member Bibeth Orteza, intended for the 2008 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF). The entry entitled "Vic Ungasis en the Escaleras" was immediately approved by the MMFF jurors. The title was changed to "Escalera and Ungasis: 20 Years After," which reunited the main characters for the first time since the original TV series.
The movie's title was changed again to "Iskul Bukol 20 Years After: Ungasis and Escaleras Adventure" in order to gain strong audience recall, owing its large fanbase to people who grew up in the '70s and '80s watching the TV show.
Filming started in late September 2008. Vic Sotto, Ryan Agoncillo, and Jose Manalo joined the crew in shooting the foreign scenes in Cambodia from October 7 to October 14. The crew wrapped up production on November 11, 2008, when the movie's reunion scene was shot at the Sta. Catalina College in Manila.
Critical reception.
The film gathered mixed reviews. On the positive side, Phillip Cu-Unjieng of the Philippine Star said the film appealed to young viewers because of the action-adventure element, while older fans of the show can relate to the characters that come back after a long time. On the negative side, Manila Times contributor Joey Ting said the film's comedic elements were rehashed staples of Tito, Vic, and Joey's usual skits. The review by Judith Juntilla of Business World criticized the film's concentration on action-adventure as an Iskul Bukol-oriented version of Enteng Kabisote's plots over the years, instead of focusing on what has happened to other Iskul Bukol characters in the past two decades beyond the film's reunion scene.
The film eventually earned PHP 107 million in earnings for the Metro Manila Film Festival and earned its Third Best Picture award, behind "Ang Tanging Ina Nyong Lahat" and top awardee Baler.

Gilkison's Corner, Pennsylvania

Gilkison's Corner was a small hamlet located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The community was in Upper Dublin Township, at the intersection of Butler Pike and Bethlehem Pike.
The term is primarily archaic in usage, and the location does not appear on modern maps. Usage of the term appears to have declined towards the end of the 19th century, around the time of the establishment of the more heavily populated Borough of Ambler, whose eastern border is located along Bethlehem Pike.
Located at the intersection of two heavily travelled early roads, Gilkison's Corner was the location of a Revolutionary War-era tavern. A large tannery was established just south of Gilkison's Corner in the 1850s, and Upper Dublin's post office was located in Gilkison's Corner until 1827.
Bean's 1884 "History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania" describes Gilkison's Corner as follows:
Gilkison's Corner is situated at the intersection of the Spring House and Butler road turnpikes. It contains a store, six or seven houses and the extensive steam tannery of Alvin D. Foust, established some thirty years ago. It was at this place where Andrew Gilkison kept a tavern in the Revolution and for some years thereafter. The Upper Dublin post-office was located here before 1827, but has been removed half a mile distant...
At the present Gilkison's Corner, on the Bethlehem turnpike, Andrew Gilkison kept an inn from 1779 to 1786, and most probably later; hence the name of the place. This was on the store property now owned by David Dunnet. About a quarter of a mile above this place was a tavern formerly kept by Benjamin Daves. Paul Bower kept an inn in 1774, and Susanna Wright in 1779, which we are at present unable to locate, but very probably in this vicinity.

Jerzy Putrament

Jerzy Putrament (born November 14, 1910 in Minsk – died June 23, 1986 in Warsaw) was a Polish writer, poet, editor, publicist and politician.
Biography.
Jerzy Putrament was born into a family with patriotic traditions. His mother was Russian and adhered to Eastern Orthodox Church, as did Jerzy.
In the Second Polish Republic, where he studied at the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, he at first leaned towards the right-wing "endecja" faction, and became a member of the Camp of Great Poland;, later he supported the communists, for which he was arrested and put on a trial. After the Soviet invasion of Poland, he remained in the territories annexed by the Soviet Union and worked as a communist functionary (lived in Lviv). At the same time, his mother and sister were deported to Siberia. Having fled to Moscow after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, he became one of the founders of the Union of Polish Patriots and a war correspondent and a political commissar in the Polish Army in the East. At that time he wrote much pro-Soviet propaganda.
In the People's Republic of Poland, he became a writer, publishing many works supporting the ideals of communism, and a politician. He became an editor of two literary journals ("Miesięcznik Literacki" from 1966 to 1971 and "Literatura" from 1955 to 1968), and as such he had significant influence on Polish cultural policy. He was a Polish ambassador to Switzerland from 1945 to 1947, an ambassador to France from 1947 to 1950, a deputy to the Polish Parliament from 1952 to 1961, and eventually member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party from 1964 to 1981).

He published his first works (poetry) before the war; his poetry anthologies ("Wczoraj powrót", 1935 ("Yesterday the Return") and "Droga leśna", 1938 ("Forest Road") were well received. Their main themes were revolutionary politics and beauty of the countryside.
His first novel was "Rzeczywistość" (1947; "Reality") which draws on his experiences of the trial for communism activism in Poland before the war. His most renown writings include the political novels "Rozstaje" (1954; “At the Crossroads”) and "Małowierni "(1967; “Those of Little Faith”) and the wartime novel "Bołdyn" (1969). "Bołdyń" was filmed in 1982 by Czesław and Ewa Petelska.

David Ewen Bartholomew

Captain David Ewen Bartholomew, CB (c. 1767/1768 – 19 February 1821) was an officer of the British Royal Navy and Merchant Navy, who rose from a poor background to become a post captain and prominent surveyor and cartographer, who was the first British man to map numerous sections of the South American, Arabian and African coastlines. During his career, Bartholomew was twice seized by press gangs and forced to serve as a sailor in the Navy, the second occasion at the orders of Lord St Vincent following an argument. This incident provoked outrage at St Vincent's abuse of his authority and resulted in Bartholomew's promotion and employment as a surveyor. He was so successful that in 1818 he was given command of the frigate HMS "Leven" on which he was ordered to survey the African coast. Many of his fellow officers later became prominent geographers of the early nineteenth century, although Bartholomew died while still on the service, after falling ill with tuberculosis.
Early life.
Born into a poor family in Linlithgowshire in Scotland, Bartholomew joined the Merchant Navy at a young age and became a highly experienced sailor, travelling to the Baltic Sea and the West Indies, working on hired merchant ships during campaigns against French islands there at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS "Romney" in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve.
Advancement.
Frustrated at his lack of employment, Bartholomew wrote eight letters to the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord St Vincent, and often visited the Admiralty in the hope of securing an appointment aboard a ship. Infuriated at Batholomew's insistence, St Vincent, a bitter personal and professional rival of Popham ordered Bartholomew seized and press ganged for a second time. Placed aboard HMS "Inflexible", Bartholomew was rapidly reinstated to his rank and a storm of protest was directed at St Vincent, who had overstepped his authority and the custom of the day by ordering the impressment of a commissioned officer after a personal disagreement. When St Vincent was forced from office in April 1804, Bartholomew was fully reinstated to his rank and seniority and rejoined Popham on HMS "Antelope" during operations against Boulogne-sur-Mer. The same year his case was heard in Parliament, where St Vincent's actions were roundly condemned as being detrimental to the practices and morale of the Navy.
In 1805, probably due to his notoriety in the aftermath of the impressment scandal, Batholomew was promoted to lieutenant and served aboard HMS "Diadem" during the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806. Later in the year, during Popham's disastrous expedition against Buenos Aires, Bartholomew was detached to conduct the first British surveys of the River Plate. In 1808, transferred to the sloop "Sapphire", Bartholomew accompanied HMS "Nereide" under Captain Robert Corbet on a mission to transport a new ambassador to Persia. During the operation, Corbet abandoned "Sapphire" and another sloop "Sylph" in the Persian Gulf. Batholomew's ship cruised the Persian coastline making an extensive survey, against the first by a British explorer in the region. The area was a dangerous pirate haven however and "Sylph" was captured and her crew massacred before Corbet returned. An expeditionary force was later despatched to the region but found itself in unfamiliar waters due to a lack of reliable charts. Bartholomew's maps of the region were published in 1810 as a direct consequence.
In July 1809, Bartholomew was given command of a transport during the Walcheren campaign and in 1810 commanded a gunboat off Cadiz in support of allied forces in the Peninsula War. In May 1811 he took over the brig HMS "Richmond". On "Richmond", Bartholomew attacked and defeated a French privateer "Intrépide" in February 1812 and was subsequently promoted to commander. In 1814, Bartholomew was in command of the rocket ship HMS "Erebus" off the United States during the War of 1812. In "Erebus", Bartholomew was part of James Alexander Gordon's successful campaign to attack Alexandria, Virginia by sailing up the Potomac River. He then operated off Georgia and participated in the attack on the St. Marys River. For his services in America. Bartholomew was promoted to post captain and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.
Geographical services.
At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Bartholomew's abilities as a surveyor and cartographer were required and he was given command of the small frigate HMS "Leven" off the West coast of Africa, charged with preparing detailed and accurate charts of the region. "Leven"'s officers were all young geographers, many of whom would later achieve prominence in the field, including Alexander Vidal, William Mudge, Alexander Becher and George Frazer. Bartholomew had successfully surveyed the Azores, stretches of West Africa and was working on the Cape Verde Islands when he fell ill with tuberculosis in 1821 and died at Porto Praya on Santiago. The expedition to West Africa was taken over by William Fitzwilliam Owen, but by its completion in 1825, over half the crew had died from tropical illnesses, including Bartholomew and his teenage son George, who died on "Leven" in 1819. He has been described as "One of the unsung heroes of the surveying service" and is also considered exceptional for his rise from an impressed sailor to post captain at a time when this was almost impossible to achieve.

Political history of Mysore and Coorg (1565–1760)

The political history of Mysore and Coorg (1565–1760) is the political history of the contiguous historical regions of Mysore state and Coorg province located on the Deccan Plateau in west-central peninsular India (Map 1). It begins with the fall of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 and ends just before the rise of Sultan Haidar Ali in 1761.
At the height of the Vijayanagara Empire (1350–1565), the Mysore and Coorg region was ruled by motley chieftains, or rajas ("little kings"), each having dominion over a small area, and each supplying soldiers and annual tribute for the empire's needs. Soon after the empire's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family, many chieftains, especially in the west, tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms. Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty, various powers from the north, the Sultanate of Bijapur to the northwest, the Sultanate of Golconda to the northeast, the fledgling Maratha empire, farther northwest, and the Mughal empire, farther north still, invaded the region intermittently. For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers, and amongst the little kings themselves, resulted in shifting sovereignties, loyalties, and borders. By the turn of the 18th century, the political landscape had become better defined: the northwestern hills were being ruled by the Nayaka rulers of Ikkeri, the southwestern, in the Western Ghats, by the Rajas of Coorg, the southern plains by the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore, Hindu dynasties all; whereas the eastern and northeastern regions were ruled by the Muslim Nawabs of Arcot and Sira. Of these, Ikkeri and Coorg were independent, Mysore, although much expanded, was formally a Mughal dependency, and Arcot and Sira, Mughal "subahs" (or provinces).
The stability, however, was not to last. Mysore's expansions had been based on unstable alliances. When the alliances began to unravel, as they did during the next half century, political decay set in, presided over inevitably by pageant kings. The Mughal governor, Nawab of Arcot, in a display of the still far-flung reach of a declining Mughal empire, raided the Mysore capital, Seringapatam, to collect unpaid taxes; the neighbouring Raja of Coorg began a war of attrition with Mysore over western territory; and soon, the Maratha empire invaded again and exacted more concessions of territory. In the chaotic last decade of this period, a little-known Muslim cavalryman, Haidar Ali, seized power in Mysore. Under him, in the decades following, Mysore was not only to expand again—and to do so prodigiously—to match in size southern India itself, but also to pose the last serious threat to the new rising power on the subcontinent, the English East India Company.
A common feature of all large regimes in the region during the period 1565–1760 is increased military fiscalism. This mode of creating income for the state, comprising extraction of tribute payments from local chiefs under threat of military action, differed both from the more segmentary modes of preceding regimes and the more absolutist modes of succeeding ones—the latter achieved through direct tax collection from citizens. Another common feature of these regimes is the fragmentary historiography devoted to them, making broad generalizations difficult.
Poligars of Vijayanagara, 1565–1635.
The last Hindu empire in South India, the Vijayanagara Empire, was defeated on January 23, 1565, in the Battle of Talikota by the combined forces of the Muslim states of Bijapur, Golconda, and Ahmadnagar to its north. The battle was fought in Talikota on the "doab" (or "tongue" of land) between the Kistna river and its major left bank tributary, the Bhima, north of the imperial capital of Vijayanagara (see Map 2). The invaders later destroyed the capital, and the ruler's family escaped to Penukonda, southeast, where they established their new capital. Soon they moved their capital another east-southeast to Chandragiri, not far from the southeastern coast, and survived there until 1635, their dwindling empire concentrating its resources on its eastern Tamil and Telugu speaking realms. According to historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam: " ... in the ten years following 1565, the imperial centre of Vijayanagara effectively ceased to be a power as far as the western reaches of the peninsula were concerned, leaving a vacuum that was eventually filled by Ikkeri and Mysore."
Earlier, in the heyday of their rule, the kings of Vijayanagara had granted tracts of lands throughout their realm to various vassal chiefs on the stipulation that they pay tribute and render military service. The chiefs in the northern regions were supervised directly from the capital. Those in the richer, more distant southern provinces, however, could not be controlled easily and the Vijayanagara emperors were able to collect only part of the annual revenue from them. Overseen by a viceroy—titled "Sri Ranga Raya" and based in the island town of Seringapatam on the river Kaveri (also Cauvery), some south of the capital—the southern chiefs bore various formal titles. These included the title "Nayaka", assumed by the chiefs of Keladi in the northwestern hills, of Basavapatna, and Chitaldroog in the north, of Belur in the west, and of Hegalvadi in the centre; the title "Gowda", assumed by the chiefs of Ballapur and of Yelahanka in the centre, and of Sugatur in the east; and "Wodeyar", assumed by the rulers of Mysore, of Kalale and of Ummatur in the south. (See Map 2.)
The somewhat tenuous hold the Vijayanagara centre had on its southern periphery resulted only partly from the latter's remoteness. The centralisation imposed by the empire was resisted by the southern chiefs (sometimes called "rajas", or "little kings") for moral and political reasons as well; according to historian Burton Stein: 'Little kings', or "rajas", never attained the legal independence of an aristocracy from both monarchs and the local people whom they ruled. The sovereign claims of would-be centralizing, South Indian rulers and the resources demanded in the name of that sovereignty diminished the resources which local chieftains used as a kind of royal largess; thus centralizing demands were opposed on moral as well as on political grounds by even quite modest chiefs.
These chiefs came to called "poligars", a British corruption of "Palaiyakkarar" (Tamil: holder of "palaiya" or "baronial estate"). (Kannada: "pale" + "gara" = palegara).
Meanwhile, almost a decade after their victories at Talikota, the Deccan sultanates of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar agreed in 1573 not to interfere in each other's future conquests by reserving regions to the south for Bijapur. In 1577, Bijapur forces attacked again and overwhelmed all opposition along the western coast. Easily taking Adoni, a former Vijayanagara stronghold, they attempted next to take Penukonda, the new Vijayanagara capital. (See Map 3).) There, however, they were repulsed by an army led by the Vijayanagara ruler's father-in-law, Jagadeva Raya, who had traveled north for the engagement from his base in Baramahal. For his services, Jagadeva Raya's territories within the crumbling empire were vastly expanded, extending westward now up to the Western Ghats, the mountain range running along the southwestern coast of India, and with a new capital in Channapatna (See Map 6.)
The territories controlled by the other poligars were also changing fast. Some, such as Tamme Gowda of Sigatur, expanded theirs by performing services for the Vijayanagara monarch and receiving territorial rewards. In Tamme Gowda's case, the rewards consisted of a tract of land which, from his base in Sigatur, extended west to Hoskote and east to Punganur. Others, such as the Wodeyars of Ummattur and of Mysore (now Mysore district), achieved the same end by ignoring the monarch altogether, and annexing small states in their vicinity. (See Map 3.)
Through much of the 16th century, the chiefs of Ummattur in particular had carried on "unceasing aggression" against their neighbors, even in the face of punitive raids by the Vijayanagara armies. In the end, as a compromise, the son of a defeated Ummattur chief was appointed the viceroy at Seringapatam. The Wodeyars of Mysore too were eying surrounding land; by 1644, when the Wodeyars unseated the powerful Changalvas of Piriyapatna, not only had they become the dominant presence in the southern regions of what later became Mysore state, but the Vijayanagara empire was also on its last legs, having only a year's life left. (See Map 6.)
Bijapur, Marathas, Mughals, 1636–1687.
The Sultans of Bijapur, for their part—some sixty years after their defeat at Penukonda—regrouped and struck again in 1636. They did so now with the blessing of the Mughal empire of Northern India, whose tributary states they had recently become. They had also the help of a Maratha chieftain of western India, Shahaji Bhonsle, who was on the lookout for rewards of "jagir" land in the conquered territories, and whose son, Shivaji Bhonsle was to found the Maratha Empire some 30 years later. In the western-central poligar regions, the Bijapur-Shahji forces achieved only mixed results: The Nayakas of Keladi were decisively defeated, but were able to buy back their lands from their Bijapur invaders. The Bijapur attack on Seringapatam was repulsed in its entirety by the reigning Wodeyar of Mysore, with great losses to the invaders. (See Map 4.)
In the east, the Bijapur-Shahji forces had better success; in 1639, they took possession of gold-rich Kolar district and soon of Bangalore, a city founded a century earlier by Kempe Gowda I, and to become, two centuries later, a hub of British presence. Next, moving down the Eastern Ghats, the range of mountains rising behind the coastal plains of southeastern India, they captured the historic towns of Vellore and Gingee. Returning north through the east-central "maidan" plain (average elevation ), they gained possession of the towns of Ballapur, Sira, and the hill fortress of Chitaldroog. (See Map 4.)
A new province named "Caranatic-Bijapur-Balaghat", consisting of possessions such as Kolar, Hoskote, Bangalore, and Sira, and situated above (or westwards of) the Eastern Ghats range, was soon incorporated into the Sultanate of Bijapur and granted to Shahji as a jagir, or temporary gift. The possessions "below" the Ghats, such as Gingee and Vellore became part of another province, named "Carnatic-Bijapur-Payanghat", whose first governor was none other than Shahji again. When Shahji died in 1664, his son, Venkoji, from his second wife, who meanwhile had become the ruler of Tanjore farther south, inherited these territories. This twist of fate, however, did not sit well with Shivaji—Shahji's oldest son, from his first wife—who now led an expedition southwards to claim his fair share. Shivaji's quick victories resulted in a partition, whereby both the "Carnatic-Bijapur" provinces became his dominions, and whereas Tanjore was retained by Venkoji. (See Map 4.)
The successes of Bijapur and Shivaji were being watched warily by the major imperial presence on the subcontinent, the Mughal Empire in North India. Having become the Mughal emperor in 1659, Aurengzeb, soon set himself upon destroying the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda, the latter famous for its diamond mines, as well as the burgeoning Maratha power of Shivaji. In 1686, the Mughals took Bijapur and, the following year, Golconda. Before long, fast moving Mughal armies were bearing down on the former Vijayanagara dominions. In 1687, a new Mughal province (or "suba") was created with capital at Sira. Bangalore, quickly taken by the Mughals from the Marathas, was sold to the Wodeyar of Mysore for 3 lakh rupees. Qasim Khan was appointed the first Mughal "Faujdar Diwan" (literally, "military governor") of the "Province of Sira".
"Wodeyars" of Mysore, 1610–1760.
Although their own histories date the origins of the Wodeyars of Mysore (also "Odeyar", "Udaiyar", "Wodiyar", "Wadiyar", or "Wadiar", and, literally, "chief") to 1399, records of them go back no earlier than the early 16th century, and according to even the late sixteenth or early 17th centuries. These "poligars" are first mentioned in a Kannada language literary work from the early 16th century. A petty chieftain, Chamaraja (now Chamaraja III), who ruled from 1513 to 1553 over a few villages not far from the Kaveri river, is said to have constructed a small fort and named it, "Mahisuranagara" "Buffalo Town"), from which Mysore gets its name. (See Map 5.) Th Wodeyar clan issued its first inscription during the chieftaincy of Timmaraja (now Timmaraja II) who ruled from 1553 to 1572. Towards the end of his rule, he is recorded to have owned 33 villages and fielded an army of 300 men. 
By the time of the short-lived incumbency of Timmaraja II's son, Chama Raja IV—who, already well into his 60s, ruled from 1572 to 1576—the Vijayanagara Empire had been dealt its fatal blow. Before long, Chama Raja IV withheld payment of the annual tribute to the now weakened empire's viceroy at Seringapatam. The viceroy responded by attempting to arrest Chamaraja IV; in this, however, he failed, and the taxes remained unpaid. An outright military challenge to the empire would have to await the incumbency of Raja I, Chama Raja IV's eldest son, who became the "Wodeyar" in 1574. Early in 1610, Raja I captured Seringapatam and, in a matter of days, on 8 February 1610, moved his capital there. (See Map 5.) During his rule, according to , his "chiefdom expanded into a major principality".
In 1638, the reins of power fell into the hands of the 23-year-old Kanthirava Narasaraja I, who, a few months earlier, had been adopted by the widow of Raja I. Kanthirava was the first "wodeyar" of Mysore to create the symbols of royalty, such as a royal mint, and went on to issue coins named "Kanthiraya" (corrupted to "Canteroy") after himself. These remained a part of Mysore's "current national money" well into the 18th century.
Catholic missionaries, who had arrived in the coastal areas of southern India—the southwestern Malabar coast, the western Kanara coast, and the southeastern Coromandel coast (also "Carnatic")—beginning early in the 16th century, did not start work in land-locked Mysore until half way through the seventeenth. (See Map 5). The Mysore mission was established in Seringapatam in 1649 by Leonardo Cinnami, an Italian Jesuit from Goa. Expelled a few years later from Mysore on account of opposition in Kanthirava's court, Cinnami returned, toward the end of Kanthirava's rule, to establish missions in half a dozen locations. During his second stay Cinnami obtained permission to convert Kanthirava's subjects to Christianity. He was successful mostly in the eastern regions, later part of the Madras Presidency of British India. According to , "Of a reported 1700 converts in the Mysore mission in the mid-1660s, a mere quarter were "Kannadigas" (Kannada language speakers), the rest being Tamil speakers from the western districts of modern-day Tamil Nadu, ..." Married ten times, the ruler died on 31 July 1659, at the age of 44. At his funeral, all his surviving wives killed themselves by committing sati on his funeral pyre.
After an unremarkable period of rule by short-lived incumbents, in 1672, Kanthirava's 27-year-old grand nephew, Chikka Devaraja, became the new "wodeyar". During his rule, centralized military power increased to an unprecedented degree for the region. (See Map 5 and Map 7.) Introducing various mandatory taxes on peasant-owned land, Chikka Devaraja, however, exempted his soldiers' land from these payments. The perceived inequity of this action, the unusually high taxes, and the intrusive nature of his regime, created wide protests which had the support of the wandering Jangama ascetics in the monasteries of the Lingayats, a monotheistic religious order that emphasizes a personal relationship with the Hindu god Shiva. According to , a slogan of the protests was: Basavanna the Bull tills the forest land; Devendra gives the rains;<br>
Why should we, the ones who grow crops through hard labor, pay taxes to the king?
The king, resolving upon a "treacherous massacre", used the stratagem of inviting over 400 monks to a grand feast at the famous Shaiva center of "Nanjanagudu" and, upon its conclusion, presenting them with gifts and directing them to exit one at a time through a narrow lane where they were each strangled and beheaded by waiting royal wrestlers. According to Mark Wilks, quoted in , "Circular orders had been sent for the destruction, on the same day, of all the Jangam "matha" (places of residence and worship) in his dominions; and the number reported to have been in consequence destroyed was upwards of seven hundred." This "sanguinary measure" had the effect of stopping cold all protests to the new taxes.
Around this time, 1687, Chikka Devaraja purchased the city of Bangalore for Rs. 3 lakhs from Qasim Khan, the new Mughal governor of the Province of Sira. Through the latter, Chikka Devaraja "assiduously cultivated an alliance" with Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. He also turned his attention to the regions that were less the objects of Moghul interest. The regions to the southeast below the Eastern Ghats mountains around Baramahal and Salem were annexed to Mysore, and, in 1694, regions in the southwest up to the Baba Budan mountains on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, were added. Two years later Chikka Devaraja attacked lands farther south belonging to the Madurai Nayak (also "Madura") and laid a siege of Trichinopoly. (See Map 7.)
After the death of Qasim Khan, his Mughal liaison, Chikka Devaraja sent a diplomatic mission to Emperor Aurangzeb at Ahmadnagar with the intention of either renewing his Mughal connections, or seeking Mughal recognition of his southern conquests. In response, in 1700, it was said, the Mughal emperor sent the Mysore Raja a signet ring "bearing the title "Jug Deo Raj" (literally, "lord and king of the world") and permission to sit on an ivory throne" and a " Firangi " Sword from his Palace Regalia, with Gold Etching on the Hilt, to be used as a Sword of State by the Mysore Raja, while sitting on the throne. After the return of the mission, Chikka Devaraja reorganized his administration into eighteen departments, in "imitation of what the envoys had seen at the Mughal court". When the Raja died on 16 November 1704, his dominions extended from Midagesi in the north to Palni Hills and Anaimalai in the south, and from Coorg in the west to Dharmapuri district in the east. (See Map 5 and Map 7.) During his long reign of 31 years, he had made Mysore a "secure and prosperous state."
However, according to , the polity that Chikka Devaraja left for his son was "at one and the same time a
strong and a weak" one. Although it had uniformly expanded in size from the mid-17th century to the early 18th century, it had done so as a result of alliances that tended to hinder the very stability of the expansions. Some of the southeastern conquests (such as that of Salem), although involving regions that were not of direct interest to the Mughals, were nonetheless the result of alliances with the Mughal governor of Sira and with Venkoji, the Maratha ruler of Tanjore; the siege of Tiruchirapalli had to be abandoned because the alliance had begun to rupture. (See Map 7.) Similarly, in addition to allegedly receiving a signet ring and a Royal State Sword or Sword of State, a consequence of the diplomatic mission sent to Aurangzeb in 1700 was formal subordination to Mughal authority and a requirement to pay annual taxes; there is evidence too that the administrative reforms Chikka Devaraja has instituted might have been a direct result of Mughal influence.
The early 18th century ushered in the rule of Kanthirava Narasaraja II, who, being both deaf and mute, ruled under the regency of a series of army chiefs ("Delavoys") all of whom hailed from a single family from the village of Kalale in the Nanjangud taluk (or sub-district) of Mysore. Upon the ruler's death in 1714 at the age of 41, his son, Dodda Krishnaraja I, still two weeks shy of his 12th birthday, succeeded him.
Around this time a change had come in the governance of the Mughal Province of Sira to the north and northeast of Mysore. (See Map 11.) In 1713, the province was split into a "payanghat" jurisdiction with capital at Arcot and governed by a newly styled Nawab of Arcot, and a "balaghat" jurisdiction with capital at Sira, and governed by an also newly styled Nawab of Sira. That same year, the military governor of the old province, Sadat-ulla Khan, was made the new Nawab of Arcot, and another official, Amin Khan, was appointed Nawab of Sira; Since Mysore remained a formal tributary state of Sira, this division, and the resulting loss of revenue from the rich "Maidān" plain of Mysore, provoked Sadat-ulla Khan's displeasure. In collusion with the rulers of Kadapa, Kurnool, and Savanur and the Maratha Raja of Gutti, he decided to march against Dodda Krishnaraja I. The Nawab of Sira, anxious to preempt the coalition's action, hit upon a similar plan for reaching the Mysore capital, Seringapatam. In the end, both Nawabs—of Arcot and Sira—settled upon a joint invasion led by the former. Dodda Krishnaraja, for his part, was able to "buy off this formidable confederacy" by offering a tribute of Rs. 1 crore (10 million). Although avoiding bloodshed, the outcome made Mysore vulnerable to similar future claims, which were made successfully two years later by Maratha raiders who appeared in the Mysore capital. The resulting depletion of the Mysore treasury led Mysore to attack and absorb the poligar chiefdom of Magadi to its north. (See Map 11.)
According to , the ruler's lack of interest in the affairs of state, led two ministers, Devaraja, the army chief (or "delavayi"), and his cousin, Nanjaraja, who was both the revenue minister (the "sarvadhikari") and the privy councilor ("pradhana"), to wield all authority in the kingdom. After Dodda Krishnaraja's death in 1736, the ministers appointed "pageant rajas", and effectively ruled Mysore until the rise of Haidar Ali in 1760.
"Nayakas" of Ikkeri and Kanara trade, 1565–1763.
In the northwestern regions, according to , an even more impressive chiefly house arose in Vijayanagara times and came to enjoy an extensive sovereignty. These were the Keladi chiefs who later founded the "Nayaka" kingdom of Ikkeri. At its greatest, the Ikkeri "rajas" controlled a territory nearly as large as the Vijayanagara heartland, some 20,000 square miles, extending about 180 miles south from Goa along the trade-rich Kanara coast. 
When Vasco da Gama landed in Calicut, on the southwestern Malabar coast of India, in 1498, the Vijayanagara empire was about to reach its apex. During the 16th century the chieftaincies, or "Nayaka" principalities, of Keladi (and later of Ikkeri and Bednur) were established in the western part of what later became Shimoga district. (See Map 2 and Map 9.) Sadasiva Raya Naik, the first of the Keladi chiefs, was granted permission by the Vijayanagara emperor to administer some towns on the western Kanara coast. In the decade after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire, the Portuguese, who until then had pursued their pepper trade entirely on the Malabar coast farther south, decided as a commercial strategy, to hedge their bets, and commenced purchasing some pepper from the Kanara region. During 1568–1569, they took possession of the coastal towns of Onor (now Honavar), Barcelor (now Basrur), and Mangalore and constructed fortresses and factories at each location. (See Map 1 and Map 8.)
Onor (Modern Honnavar) was located on the banks of the Sharavathi River, two miles (3 km) upstream from the mouth, where the river widened into a lake. Built strategically on a cliff overlooking the river, the Portuguese fort contained homes for thirty "casados" (married settlers). A natural sandbank kept out the large ocean-going ships, and left the harbour accessible only to small craft. Approximately, farther upstream, the Portuguese maintained a weighing station at Gersoppa, where they purchased the pepper. During the latter part of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th, Onor became not only the principal port for the export of Kanara pepper, but also the most important Portuguese supply point for pepper in all of Asia.
Located some south of Onor, and a few miles up the Coondapoor estuary (now Varahi) was the town of Barcelore (now Basrur). Building their fortress downstream of the existing Hindu town in order to control any approaches from the sea, the Portuguese provided accommodation for some 30 "casados" within its walls; another 35 casados and their families lived in a walled area at a stone's throw. Barcelore became a busy trading centre which exported rice, local textiles, saltpetre, and iron from the interior regions and imported corals, exotic yard goods and horses. (See Map 1 and Map 8.)
Fifty miles south of Barcelore was Mangalore, the last of the Portuguese strongholds in Kanara, situated on the mouth of the Netravati River. There too the Portuguese built a fortress and alongside it a walled town with accommodation for 35 "casados" families. Both Barcelore and Mangalore became principal ports for the export of rice and during the first half of the 17th century and supplied the many strategic "fortalezas" that were of significance to the "Estado da India", the Portuguese Asian empire. These included, Goa, Malacca, Muscat, Mozambique and Mombasa. (See Map 1.)
As a ready source of rice, pepper and teak, the Kanara coast was important to the "Estado da India". For much of the 16th century, Portuguese had been able to negotiate favorable terms of trade with the weak principalities that constituted the Kanara coast. Towards the end of the century, the "Nayaka" ruler of Keladi (and Ikkeri), Venkatappa Nayaka (r. 1592–1629), "assumed independence" from the residual Vijayanagara empire. Asserting power, he and his successors, Virabhadra Nayaka (r. 1629–1645) and Shivappa Nayaka (r. 1645–1660) forced a revision of the previous trade treaties. By the 1630s, the Portuguese had agreed to buy pepper at market rates and the rulers of Ikkeri had been permitted two voyages per year without the purchase of a "cartaz" (a pass for Portuguese protection) as well as annual importation of twelve duty-free horses.
With the Bijapur raids threatening the region, Shivappa Nayaka moved the capital once again, this time to Bednur (later Nagar), which was deemed safer. (See Map 6.) Shivappa Nayaka rapidly took possession of a region that extended east to Shimoga, south to Manjarabad, and west through most of the Kanara coast. When the last king of Vijayanagara sought refuge in his realms, Shivappa Nayaka set him up at Belur and Sakkarepatna, and later mounted an unsuccessful siege of Seringapatam on the latter's behalf. By the 1650s, he had driven the Portuguese out of the three "fortalezas" at Onor, Barcelore, and Mangalore. After his death in 1660, his successor Somashker Nayaka, however, sent an embassy to Goa for reestablishing the Portuguese trading posts in Kanara. By 1671 a treaty, which was very favorable once again to the Portuguese, had been agreed to. (See Map 8 and Map 9.)
Before the treaty could be implemented, Somashkar Nayaka died and was succeeded by an infant grandson Basava Nayaka, his succession disputed by the Queen Mother, who favored another claimant, Timmaya Nayaka. The 1671 treaty languished amidst the succession struggle until 1678, when yet another treaty was negotiated with Basava Nayaka who emerged as the victor. Since both parties in the succession struggle had been interested in purchasing European artillery from the Portuguese, the eventual treaty of 1678 was even more favorable to the latter. Under it, Basava agreed to pay 30,000 xerafins in Portuguese war-charges for the decade-long conflict with the Dutch (whom the Nayakas of Ikkeri had supported), to provide construction material for the factory at Mangalore, to provide 1,500 sacks of clean rice annually, to pay a yearly tribute for Mangalore and Barcelore, to destroy the factories of the Omani Arabs on the Kanara coast, and to allow Catholic churches to be built at a number of locations in Kanara. With the treaty in place, Portuguese power returned to Kanara after an interregnum of almost half a century. The Nayakas of Ikkeri, in their turn, managed to control the region until 1763, at which time Haidar Ali took possession of it and declared the intention of making a new capital, later called Nagar. (See Map 9.)
"Subahdars" of Sira, 1689–1760.
A Mughal province, which comprised the Carnatic region south of the Tungabhadra river, and which was to exist for seventy years, was established in 1687 with its capital at Sira (in Tumkur District). (See Map 10.) Known as the "Province of Sira" (also "Carnatic-Balaghat"), it was composed of seven parganas (districts): Basavapatna, Budihal, Sira, Penukonda, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote, and Kolar; in addition, Harpanahalli, Kondarpi, Anegundi, Bednur, Chitaldroog, and Mysore were considered by the Mughals to be tributary states of the province. Qasim Khan (also, Khasim Khan or Kasim Khan) was appointed the first "Subahdar" (governor) and "Faujdar" (military governor) of the province in 1689. Having displayed "energy and success" both in controlling and in developing the province, he died in 1694, either killed by Maratha raiders from the northwest, or killing himself in disgrace after these raiders seized a treasure under his care. Most "Subhahdars" who governed after him were to be replaced in a year or two by a successor. The instability would continue until Dilavar Khan was appointed governor in 1726, his term lasting until 1756. In 1757, Sira was overrun by the Marathas, only to be restored to the Mughals in 1759. In 1761 future ruler Haidar Ali, whose own father had been the Mughal military governor (or "Faujdar") of Kolar district in the province, captured Sira, and soon conferred on himself the title of "Nawab of Sira". However, the defection of his brother five years later caused the province to be lost again to the Marathas, who retained it until Haidar's son, Tipu Sultan, recaptured it for his father in 1774.
The capital of the province, Sira town, prospered most under Dilavar Khan and expanded in size to accommodate 50,000 homes. (See Map 10.) Palaces and public monuments of Sira became models for other future constructions; both Haidar Ali's palace in Bangalore and Tipu Sultan's in Seringapatam, built during the period 1761–1799 of their rule, were modeled after Dilavar Khan's palace in Sira. Likewise, according , Bangalore's Lal Bagh as well as Bangalore fort may have been designed after Sira's Khan Bagh gardens and Sira fort respectively. Sira's civil servants, however, could not be as readily reproduced; after Tipu Sultan had succeeded his father as Sultan of Mysore in 1782, he deported 12,000 families, mainly of city officials, from Sira to Shahr Ganjam, a new capital he founded on Seringapatam island.
Earlier, in 1689, after the Moghul armies had overrun the region of the Mysore table-land, twelve parganas (or sub-districts) were annexed to the newly formed province ("subah") of Sira. The remaining region was allowed to remain under the rule of the "poligars", who continued to collect taxes from the cultivators, but were now required to pay annual tribute to the provincial government in Sira. In the annexed regions, in which tax assessment on cultivation was under "amāni" or "Sarkār" (provincial government) management, an elaborate system of officials collected and managed revenue. Most offices had existed in the region under the previous Bijapur Sultanate administration, and consisted, among others, of "Deshmūks", "Deshpāndes", "Majmūndārs", and "Kānungoyas". The "Deshmūks" "settled accounts" with the village headmen (or "patels"); the "Deshpāndes" verified the account-books of the village registrars (or "kārnāms"); the "Kānungoyas" entered the official regulations in the village record-books and also explained decrees and regulations to the village governing officers and residents.
Lastly, the "Majmūndārs" prepared the final documents of the "settlement" ("i.e." the assessment and payment of tax) and promulgated it.
Until the mid-17th century, both village- and district ("taluq") accounts had been prepared in the language and script of Kannada, the region's traditional language.
However, after the Bijapur invasions, Maratha chieftains came to wield authority in the region and brought in with them various officials who introduced the Marathi language and script into the "public accounts". The new language even found its way into lands ruled by some poligar chiefs. These chieftains had brought in Marathi-speaking horsemen from the northern Bijapur realms for their newly formed cavalry units and resorted to hiring Maratha accountants for the benefit of these cavalrymen. After the province of Sira was created, the official language of the Moghul empire, Persian, came to be used.
Rajas of Coorg, mid-16th century–1768.
Although, "Rājendranāme", a "royal" genealogy of the rulers of Coorg, written in 1808, makes no mention of the origin of the lineage, its reading by historian Lewis Rice led him to conclude that the princely line was established by a member of the Ikkeri Nayaka family. Having moved south to the town of Haleri in northern Coorg in the disguise of a wandering Jangama monk, he soon began to attract followers; then, with their help, or their acquiescence, he took possession of the town, and in such manner came to rule the entire country. (See Map 11.) According to the genealogy, the Coorg "rajas" who ruled from the mid-16th century to the mid-18th century were:
By the late 17th-century, the "raja"s of Coorg had created an "aggressive and independent" state, which became known for its acts of "wanton cruelty" against enemies, and for its "system of terror" directed at its citizens. Muddu Raja, the Coorg ruler from 1633 to 1687, initially ruled from the town of Haleri, but later moved his capital to Mercara, which he fortified and where he built a palace in 1681. Early during the rule of his successor, Dodda Virappa (1687–1736), the army of the neighboring kingdom of Mysore, under the orders of "Wodeyar" Chikka Devaraja, attacked and seized Piriyapatna, a territory which abutted Coorg (see Map 11), and which was then being ruled by a kinsman of Dodda Virappa. Buoyed by the victory, the Mysore army soon attacked Coorg itself; however, it had advanced only a short distance, when, while camping overnight on the plain of Palupare, it was surprised by a Coorg ambush. In the ensuing massacre, the Mysore army lost 15,000 men, and the survivors had to beat a hasty retreat.
For most of the next two decades, the western reaches of Mysore remained vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to a stalemate and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.
In 1724, major hostilities resumed between Coorg and Mysore. Changing his modus operandi from guerrilla skirmishes in the hilly Coorg jungle to open field warfare, Dodda Virappa, attacked the Mysore army in the plains. Catching it off guard, he took in rapid succession six fortresses from Piriyapatna to Arkalgud. The resulting loss of revenue, some 600,000 gold pagodas, was felt in Mysore, and several months later, in August or September 1724, a large army was sent from Seringapatam, the Mysore capital, to Coorg. Upon the Mysore army's arrival in the western region, however, the Coorg forces, returning to guerrilla warfare, retreated into the woods. Emboldened by the lack of resistance, the Mysore forces next mounted an attack on the Coorg hills. There too, they met no resistance. However, a few days into this invasion, the Mysore forces, recalling their ignominious ambush in the 1890s, panicked and retreated during the night. Soon, the Coorg army was attacking the Mysore outposts again. This pattern of back and forth was to continue until the Mysore army was recalled, a few months later, to Seringapatam, leaving the region again vulnerable to the periodic raids of the Coorg army. According to historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, The entire episode yields a rare insight into one aspect of war in the 18th century: the (Coorg) forces, lacking cavalry, with a minimum of
firearms, lost every major battle, but won the war by dint of two factors. First, the terrain, and the possibility of retreating periodically into the wooded hillside, favoured them, in contrast to their relatively clumsy opponents. Second, the Mysore army could never maintain a permanent presence in the region, given the fact that the Wodeyar kingdom had several open frontiers.
More than a century earlier, Lewis Rice, had written: Dodda Virappa evinced throughout his long and vigorous reign an unconquerable spirit, and though surrounded by powerful neighbours, neither the number nor the strength of this enemies seems to have relaxed his courage or damped his enterprise. He died in 1736, 78 years old. Two of his wives ascended the funeral pile with the dead body of the Raja.
The ruler was succeeded by his grandson, Chikka Virappa, whose unremarkable rule lasted until 1768, when Coorg was conquered by Haidar Ali, the new sultan of Mysore.
Assessment: the period and its historiography.
From the mid-15th century to the mid-18th century, according to historian Burton Stein, rulers of states in southern India commenced financing wars on a different footing than had their predecessors. To varying degrees, all the rulers of the Mysore and Coorg region—the Vijayanagara emperors, the "Wodeyars" of Mysore, the "Nayakas" of Ikkeri, the "Subahdars" of Sira, and the "Rajas" of Coorg—fall under this category. A similar political system, referred to as "military fiscalism" by French historian Martin Wolfe, took hold in Europe between the 15th and 17th centuries. During this time, according to Wolfe, most regimes in Western Europe emerged from the aristocracy to become absolute monarchies; they simultaneously reduced their dependence on the aristocracy by expanding the tax base and developing an extensive tax collection structure. In Stein's words, Previously resistant aristocracies were eventually won over in early modern Europe by being offered state offices and honors and by being protected in their patrimonial wealth, but this was only after monarchies had proven their ability to defeat antiquated feudal forces and had found alternative resources in cities and from trade.
In southern India, none of the pre-1760 regimes were able to achieve the "fiscal absolutism" of their European contemporaries. Local chieftains, who had close ties with their social groups, and who had only recently risen from them, opposed the excessive monetary demands of a more powerful regional ruler. Consequently, the larger states of this period in southern India, were not able to entirely change their mode of creating wealth from one of extracting tribute payments, which were seldom regular, to that of direct collection of taxes by government officials. Extorting tribute under threat of military action, according to Stein, is not true "military fiscalism," although it is a means of approaching it. This partial or limited military fiscalism began during the Vijayanagara Empire, setting the latter apart from the more "segmentary" regimes that had preceded it, and was a prominent feature of all regimes during the period 1565–1760; true military fiscalism was not achieved in the region until the rule of Tipu Sultan in the 1780s.
Stein's formulation has been criticized by historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, on account of the lack of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavur—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.
The first explicit "History" of Mysore in English is "Historical Sketches of the South of India, in an attempt to trace the History of Mysoor" (), by Mark Wilks. Wilks claimed to have based his history on various Kannada language documents, many of which have not survived. According to , all subsequent histories of Mysore have borrowed heavily from Wilks's book for their pre-1760 content. These include, , Lewis Rice's well-known "Gazetteer" and , C. Hayavadana Rao's major revision of the "Gazetteer" half a century later, and many modern spin-offs of these two works. In Subrahmanyam's words, "Wilks's work is an important one therefore, not only for its own sake, but for its having been regurgitated and reproduced time and again with minor variations."
A Wodeyar dynasty genealogy, the "Chikkadevaräya Vamśävali" of Tirumalarya, was composed in Kannada during the period 1710–1715, and was claimed to be based on all the then-extant inscriptions in the region. Another genealogy, "Kalale Doregala Vamśävali", of the "Delvoys", the near-hereditary chief ministers of Mysore, was composed around the turn of the "19th" century. However, neither manuscript provides information about administration, economy or military capability. The ruling dynasty's origins, especially as expounded in later palace genealogies, are also of doubtful accuracy; this is, in part, because the Wodeyars, who were reinstated by the British on the Mysore "gaddi" in 1799, to preside over a fragile sovereignty, "obsessively" attempted to demonstrate their "unbroken" royal lineage, to bolster their then uncertain status.
The earliest manuscript offering clues to governance and military conflict in the pre-1760 Mysore, seems to be Dias , an annual letter written in Portuguese by a Mysore-based Jesuit missionary, Joachim Dias, and addressed to his Provincial superior. After the East India Company's final 1799 victory over Tipu Sultan, official Company records began to be published as well; these include , a collection of Anglo-Mysore Wars-related correspondence between the Company's officials in India and Court of Directors in London, and , the first report on the new Princely State of Mysore by its resident, Mark Wilks. Around this time, French accounts of the Anglo-Mysore wars appeared as well, and included , a history of the wars by Joseph-François Michaud, another Jesuit priest. The first attempt at including a comprehensive history of Mysore in an English language work is , an account of a survey of South India conducted at Lord Richard Wellesley's request, by Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician and geographer. By the end of the period of British Commissionership of Mysore (1831–1881), many English language works had begun to appear on a variety of Mysore-related subjects. These included , a book of English translations of Kannada language inscriptions, and , William Digby's two volume critique of British famine policy during the Great Famine of 1876–78, which devastated Mysore for years to come.

<doc id="20914885" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20914885" title="The Gugulethu Seven">
The Gugulethu Seven

The Gugulethu Seven was an anti-apartheid group of men between the ages of 16 and 23 that were shot and killed on 3 March 1986 by members of the South African Police force. The seven men included Mandla Simon Mxinwa, Zanisile Zenith Mjobo, Zola Alfred Swelani, Godfrey Jabulani Miya, Christopher Piet, Themba Mlifi and Zabonke John Konile. It was later uncovered that the police operation that unearthed the Gugulethu Seven's plans, had been in the works for some time.
Leading Up to the Incident.
In the mid 1980s, there was a rise in Umkhonto we Sizwe or MK operatives, the 1961-founded, armed wing of the ANC. In response, General Griebenouw of the Western Cape Security called upon Brigadier Schoon of the Security Branch Headquarters in Pretoria as well as the assistance of the Vlakplaas. Vlakplaas commander, Eugene de Kock chose Rian Bellingan to lead an operative team ordered to intervene with anti-apartheid operations. The men chosen as part of the team were Thapelo Johannes Mbelo, Joe Coetzer, and other Vlakplaas askaris like Gladstone Moss, Eric 'Shakes' Maluleke and Jimmy Mbane.
The operative team was based in Koeberg and in early January 1986, drove into Cape Town aboard three vehicles; one was a minibus with weapons and explosives concealed inside. After failed attempts to infiltrate Mbelo into the Gugulethu Seven, Mbane and Maluleke were sent in.
Mbane and Maluleke, who reported to Bellingan and Liebenberg, were successful at slipping in and gaining the trust of the Gugulethu Seven over time. At first they were given weapons and grenades and went to the home of Yamile (the squatter leader). There, they told Yamile that they were commanders from exile and showed him their weapons in the minibus. Yamile then introduced Mbane and Maluleke to Piet, a member and the supposed leader of the Gugulethu Seven. It is said that Mbane and Maluleke even helped fix Piet's faulty AK-47 at one point.
Over the next two months, Mbane trained the youth in basic military combat while Maluleke gave them a political education; Piet seemed to be the only youth that had previous combat training. Mbane and Maluleke also had the youth write their own biographies, which was a standard practice in liberation movements. It was later discovered that Mbane gave those to Bellingan.
Eventually, an attack was planned for 3 March that would target a police bus that took senior policemen to Gugulethu station every morning. Mbane told Bellingan and Liebenberg this, who prepared for the event.
The Incident.
On 3 March 1986, 25 heavily armed police were briefed and deployed at Wingfield Naval Base at 3 a.m. The intended target area was surrounded and occupied by police by 5 a.m. Mbane, driving a stolen bakery van, dropped the seven youth off at the site around 7:25 a.m. Allegedly, grenades were thrown by the Gugulethu Seven and the police started firing from all sides. Reports say that Piet was the only one who had time to fire back. The police officers at the scene included: Warrant Officers Barnard and McMaster, Majors Johan Kleyn, Dolf Odendal, and Stephanus Brits, Captain Charles Brazzelle, Sergeants John Sterrenberg, Andre Grobbellar and Rian Bellingan, and Constable Thapelo Mbelo.
For their help in exposing and leading the Gugulethu Seven into fire, Mbane and Maluleke were given ZAR7000 - one thousand for each victim.
It was later reported that Piet suffered 12 bullet wounds to his head.
Aftermath & Mother's Testimony.
Piet and the Gugulethu Seven's deaths led to an inquest in 1986, and a trial in 1987, which later reopened in 1989. The findings by Wynberg magistrate, Mr. Hoffman, were that the seven men had died in a legitimate anti-terrorist operation. In her 27 November 1996 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Gross Human Rights Violations testimony, Piet's mother Cynthia Nomveyu Ngewu said the trials in court were dissatisfying and she couldn't understand the language being spoken; the proceedings were in Afrikaans.
Ngewu said she had to see her dead son being dragged with a rope around his waist, broadcast on television. The police told her that her son had shot at the police and they later came by her home to look for weapons. Ngewu later expressed her forgiveness and reconciliatory beliefs in regards to her son's killing:
"We do not want to return the evil that perpetrators committed to the nation. We want to demonstrate humanness towards them, so that they in turn may restore their own humanity".
The South African Police that applied for amnesty for the killings were Rian Bellingan, Thapelo Mbelo, and Xola Frank 'Jimmy' Mbane.
Memorial.
On 21 March 2005, Human Rights Day in South Africa, a monument was erected in Gugulethu honoring the lives of the Gugulethu Seven. It is outside the Gugulethu police station on the corner of NY1 and NY111 right near where the Seven, including Christopher 'Rasta' Piet, were shot.
Movie.
In 2000, a film of the events surrounding the Gugulethu Seven, directed by Lindy Wilson, was released.

Santika Club fire

The Santika Club fire occurred on Thursday 1 January 2009, in the Santika Club nightclub in Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand, where New Year celebrations were taking place. A total of 66 people were killed and another 222 injured when fire swept through the nightclub during the New Year's celebration as a band coincidentally called "Burn" was playing. The fire broke out at 12:35 a.m. and citizens of thirteen countries were among the injured.
Cause of the fire.
No official cause for the Santika fire has been announced by investigators. Suggested causes include outdoor fireworks that set the roof on fire, sparklers lighted inside the nightclub. and an electrical explosion. One witness stated there were no pyrotechnics in the club, while another reported seeing flames on the roof after going outside to watch the midnight fireworks display. Video recordings of the indoor stage event, including the countdown, show that only ordinary holiday sparklers were used. Moreover, the fire became visible indoors approximately 10 minutes after midnight. This strongly suggests the fire originated inside the ceiling space or on the roof, allowing it to grow in intensity while going unnoticed for some time. Due to the lax enforcement of building regulations, tar paper and plastic are often used as waterproofing materials.
Around 1,000 guests and employees were in the club when it burned, and deaths occurred from smoke inhalation, burns and being crushed during a stampede for the exit. Doctors stated that fumes from burning plastic could have caused people to faint after a few minutes. Santika only had one main exit, with an additional private staff exit. A third exit was locked to prevent robberies.
Aftermath.
The injured were taken to 19 hospitals, with most brought to Bangkok Hospital. Only 29 of the 61 bodies were immediately identified, of these 28 were Thais and the other a Singaporean. The bodies of those who died were wrapped in white cloth and placed in the club's car park pending removal. It took up to a week to identify the others because of extensive burns to their bodies. Pongsak Kasemsan, an official in Bangkok, ordered a preliminary investigation, with results by January 4.
After a preliminary inspection of the club's safety system, it was declared "substandard" by police Lieut. Gen. Jongrak Jutanont. It was revealed the club only had one fire extinguisher, and that the nightclub was registered as a food vendor (restaurant), meaning it was required by law to close at midnight.
Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva visited the site and said, "The question is why they let someone take fireworks inside the pub and light them up."
Investigations and Criminal Proceedings.
The owner of the Santika Club was charged, along with twelve other directors. The owner was also charged with allowing an underage customer into the club after a 17-year-old student's body was recovered. He faced a further charge of carelessness resulting in death.
Two parallel investigations were launched, one by the police and one by the Ministry of Justice. The police blamed the lead singer of "Burn" for setting off fireworks on stage, and the club owner for recklessness and for illegally admitting people under the age of 19. The Ministry of Justice investigation discovered the nightclub was officially registered as a private residence and therefore had never received a fire safety inspection. It was also located in a zone where nightclubs are prohibited and the city architect's signature approving the club's design had been forged. Between 2004 and 2006, police had filed 47 charges against the club's owners for illegal operation. After that, however, no charges were filed. Suspicions of corruption were raised when one of the co-owners was identified as a senior police officer. When the Ministry of Justice investigation was turned over to the police, sources close to the Minister reported he was furious.
On 20 Sept 2011, Thailand's Criminal Court found two persons—Mr Wisuk Setsawat, the pub owner, and Mr Boonchu Laorinath, the light and sound company's owner—guilty of negligence. Mr Wisuth and Mr Boonchoo were given three-year jail terms. Boonchoo was also ordered to pay Bt8.5 million in compensation to five plaintiffs, relatives of the victims.

Ken Ernst was born in 1918 in Illinois. At the age of 12, he was elected President of the Chicago Chapter of the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Ernst began his working life as a stage magician, but he aimed for a career in art. Using money made performing magic to finance his education, he studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts.
Comic books.
In 1936, Ernst began his art career during the burgeoning Golden Age of Comic Books. He joined the Harry "A" Chesler comic book production shop, where he contributed to "Star Comics" and "Funny Pages" until 1943. He took assignments on numerous titles from Centaur in the late 1930s. Ernst also worked for National Periodical Publications on "Larry Steele" and at Western Publishing on "Buck Jones", "Tom Mix" and "Clyde Beatty". He is credited with the art on back-up stories in the DC Comics flagship title "Detective Comics", issues 31-33, 38, and most issues between 39 and 49.
Comic strips.
It was in the field of newspaper comics, however, that Ken Ernst became famous. Between 1940 and 1942, he assisted on the daily "Don Winslow of the Navy" strip. (Another source reports that he "ghosted" that strip). In 1942, Ernst took over as artist on the King Features Syndicate comic strip "Mary Worth", and that strip became his life's work. Ernst rendered the strip, scripted by Allen Saunders, in a realistic style "inspired by that of his mentors Milton Caniff and Noel Sickles." His "Mary Worth" became a prototype for the "gentle and sophisticated" soap opera strip.
Eminent comic strip historian Coulton Waugh made note of Ernst's "smooth, smart, dressy, modern style." Waugh also admired Ernst's device of drawing a group of characters in a panel without any background and—through clever use of shadow—making the figures appear to leap out of the panel.
Influence.
In terms of style, later strips such as "Rex Morgan, M.D.", "Judge Parker", "The Heart of Juliet Jones" and "Apartment 3-G" among others are said to have followed Ernst's lead.
The Wisconsin Historical Society possesses some black and white photographs of Ernst sketching co-eds at the University of Wisconsin on February 5, 1947. Ernst is said to have chosen one of the young women to serve as the model for a new character in "Mary Worth". Seven related images were published in the "Wisconsin State Journal" on February 9, 1947.
Ernst's artwork appeared in comic books again in the late 1940s and early 1950s in "The Green Hornet" from Harvey Comics, but the panels were reprints of his "Mary Worth".
Ken Ernst illustrated the "Mary Worth" strip until the time of his death. He died August 6, 1985 of a heart attack, while visiting his son in Salem, Oregon.

Gaetano Crivelli

Gaetano Crivelli (1768–1836) was a famous Italian tenor.
Although he was born not actually in Bergamo but in neighbouring Brescia, Crivelli can be regarded as one of the founders of that remarkable Bergamo tenor school which, beginning with Giacomo David and proceeding through such singers as Giovanni David, Andrea Nozzari, Domenico Donzelli and Marco Bordogni, culminated in the great Giovanni Battista Rubini. 
Crivelli, a baritonal tenor in the eighteenth century’s Italian manner, made his first public appearance rather late, aged 28, in his native town. He sang in several other Italian theatres before his début at Milan’s La Scala in 1805, in the première of Mayr’s opera "Eraldo ed Emma". He appeared in the Italian première of Mozart's "La clemenza di Tito" at Naples's Teatro di San Carlo, in 1809. Crivelli then moved to Paris, where, at the Théâtre des Italiens in 1811, he performed what was probably his best-suited opera, "Pirro" by Giovanni Paisiello: he afterwards performed it with lesser success in London. Despite this lack of success he gave England an important legacy in the form of his son Domenico, who settled permanently there, first as a singer and later as a singing teacher, a prominent figure in English musical life of that period. 
Having returned to Italy, Gaetano pursued his career for several years mainly in the northern theatres, as for example at La Scala, where he sang in "La clemenza di Tito" at its 1818 revival, or at Venice’s La Fenice, where he played opposite Giuditta Pasta in the first performance of Giuseppe Nicolini’s "La conquista di Granata"; in 1821, opposite the prima-donna Francesca Maffei Festa, in the première of Saverio Mercadante’s opera "Andronico"; and in 1824 in the first performance of Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto, the last major opera with a role for a castrato (played then by Giovanni Battista Velluti).
In his long career Crivelli distinguished himself principally for his capability to exploit to the full his bari-tenor qualities of quivering and passionate accent and expressive vigour, rather than for any florid virtuosity. Thus he made a remarkable contribution to the first 19th century belcanto revival which was about to inspire the golden age of singing for which Rossini composed. He was not, however, a leading figure within that revival, perhaps because he lacked an acrobatic virtuoso technique. He died in Brescia.

Kalec Castle

Kalec Castle (, originally Kalc or Kauc) is a partially ruined castle near Zagorje in Slovenia.
The castle, of which only a single tower and some sections of wall survive intact, stands on slope known as "Breg", near the source of the river Pivka, at an elevation of 618 m. 
Illustrated in Valvasor's 1689 Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, it was built in the mid-17th century by the noble house of Steinberg. Its later owners included the Auersperg family and the Slovene composer Miroslav Vilhar, who also died in it. The castle was abandoned by its last residents after World War I, and began falling apart. 
In 1941 it hosted a meeting of the antifascist militant group TIGR. 
Today the Krpan Hiking Path passes beside the ruins, which are surrounded by a copse of ancient linden trees. The path to the castle is bordered by a chestnut tree row.

Tuvan National Orchestra

The Tuvan National Orchestra reflects the complex history of the Republic of Tuva (sometimes spelled Tyva), a tiny nation which sits at the southern edge of Siberia, with Mongolia to its south. Over the centuries, Tuva has been part of Chinese and Mongolian empires, and shares many cultural ties with Mongolia. In 1944 it joined the Soviet Union, and Tuva is now a member of the Russian Federation.
Formed in 2003 as the Tuvan National Orchestra of Traditional Instruments, the orchestra was originally directed by Aldar Tamdyn. It is now led by Conductor and Artistic Director Ayana Samiyaevna Mongush. In this unique orchestra, traditional Tuvan instruments are played alongside classical Western instruments and Soviet-era “hybrid” instruments. In addition, the musicians sing as well as play. The orchestra's repertoire often features the ancient art of Tuvan throat singing (xöömei), a remarkable technique for singing multiple pitches at the same time. Ayana Mongush is perhaps the only person in the world who can arrange and score music for such an unusual combination of instruments and voices. The orchestra is extremely versatile, at times sounding more western, at times more Tuvan. Its unique renditions of traditional Tuvan songs are especially popular in Tuva.
The Tuvan National Orchestra has earned recognition throughout the Russian Federation. In 2005, just two years after its inception, it won one of the first prizes in the All-Russia Competition of Folk Orchestras and Ensembles, held in Saratov, Russia. The following year it competed in the newly configured All-Russia Competition of National Orchestras and Ensembles, held in Ulan-Ude (capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia), where it won the overall grand prize as well as a special prize for the most original program. It then performed in a two-day gala held in Moscow in 2008 to honor the regional winners.
Orchestra members include musicians known in the West for their throatsinging (members of the groups Chirgilchin, Tyva Kyzy, and Alash), Andrei Mongush (formerly of Huun-Huur-Tu), Ai-Xaan Oorzhak, Kang-Xuler Saaya, and Nikolai Damba, among others.

Texas Hold 'Em Poker (video game)

"Texas Hold 'Em Poker" is a card game video game developed by Skyworks Technologies and published by Majesco Games for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.
Gameplay.
The game follows the rules and nuances of the community card game Texas hold 'em. Before starting a game, the player chooses an avatar to represent themselves at the table. The player is also able to select a tell that their avatar reveals throughout the game in attempts to confuse opponents. When it is the player's turn, they can call, raise bets, go all in, or check using the bottom touchscreen of the Nintendo DS.
While the player progresses through the game and win tournaments, additional avatars and new locations are unlocked. Despite the game's name of "Texas Hold 'Em Poker", a variety of other poker games are also included, such as five-card stud and five-card draw.
Reception.
"Texas Hold 'Em Poker" was given a score of 6.0 from video game critic website IGN, which found that although "game is easy to play and still retains the fun of the Texas Hold ‘Em card design in a single player fashion," " still can’t beat the real deal, physical computer experience, which is why it’s a little upsetting that the design team didn’t take advantage of elements that would work better in a virtual setting – stat tracking being a key element that’s missing here." They were also disappointed with the game's lack of support for the Nintendo DS' single cartridge feature to allow other Nintendo DS systems use the same cartridge to play the game together. The review concluded by noting that "Texas Hold 'Em Poker" was simply a passable DS game, but that it was not much better than that.
"The Sydney Morning Herald" felt that the game's computer-controlled opponents acted appropriately; they bet when they had the upper hand and folded when they did not. "Texas Hold 'Em Poker" was given a score of 2.5 out of 5 from "The Sydney Morning Herald". The video game magazine "Nintendo Power" gave the game a score of 50%, finding that the menu that asks the player to select a tell before every move got tiring quickly.

William &quot;Caveman&quot; Lee

William Lee (born September 27, 1956 in Detroit, Michigan) is a former professional middleweight boxer who fought out of the fabled Kronk Gym in Detroit.
Career.
One fight for which Lee is noted was with John LoCicero in July, 1981. Televised on ESPN, their battle garnered a good degree of renown that year for its ebb, flow, ferocity and stifling conditions. In an interview, long time boxing commentator Al Bernstein put it thus: "It was in the early Kronk gym days, in the Twenty Grand Showroom in Detroit with no air conditioning. It was August and amazingly hot. In the fifth round, John LoCicero and Caveman Lee put on a round of boxing that was just beyond belief. First, LoCicero went down, got up, and hit Lee with like twenty-five unanswered punches. It was ridiculous. LoCicero ultimately got knocked out in that round and it was about as exciting as anything I’ve ever seen.”
Indeed, in another interview Berstein mentioned this round ahead of Hagler/Hearns and Castillo/Corrales when relating the best rounds he had ever seen.
The other notable item in Lee's boxing background is more ignominious. When Lee's Kronk stablemate Mickey Goodwin was slated to challenge Marvin Hagler for the Middleweight Championship, but suffered a training injury, Lee stepped in to replace him. Unfortunately, Lee didn't have quite the showing against Hagler as he had against LoCicero. Lee was blown out in just over a minute.
Retirement.
After boxing, Lee's story also ran into unfortunate results. He did three different stints in prison for armed robbery. However, once parolled for that third time, he found a job at an auto parts yard and was working there into 2008.
Additional Information.
Incidentally, Lee's nickname "Caveman" - one of the best in boxing history - was due to the sideburns he wore in the late 70's.

Born in Cardenden, Fife, Hunter began his football career with local club Bowhill Juniors before turning professional with Birmingham in 1921. He never established himself as a first-team player with the club, but was a mainstay of the reserve team and performed solidly when given a game in the First Division. He joined Grimsby Town in early 1927, spending only a few months with the club and making just six appearances before returning to the Midlands to sign for Coventry City. The following year he moved to Walsall, and in late 1929 moved on again, this time to Torquay United, before retiring at the end of the 1929–30 season.

Pre-start-up audit

The Pre-Start-Up Audit (PSUA) is a vital part of projects that deal with the construction, reconditioning or repair of equipment and facilities designed to process hazardous substances. 
Overview.
The PSUA process is commonly found in nuclear, oil, gas, pharmaceutical and petrochemical projects and comprises a combined safety and operability audit to ensure that hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials can be safely introduced into a newly constructed (or reconstructed) plant, asset or facility for the first time. 
Furthermore, it is used to assure the owner or operator of that plant, asset or facility that it is capable of starting, controlling and stopping it safely, efficiently and without harm to people, the plant itself or to the environment.
A PSUA is often preceded by a Pre-Start-Up Review (PSUR), some months prior to the scheduled PSUA, in order to evaluate the magnitude of the outstanding work that will need to be completed prior to start-up. This will also provide feedback to the project team of any items that have been overlooked or may seem to be behind schedule.
The PSUA process is often carried out as a part of the operations readiness and assurance (OR&A) process.

<doc id="20915089" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20915089" title="Interim Self Governing Authority">
Interim Self Governing Authority

The Interim Self Governing Authority was a proposal issued on October 2003 by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) of Sri Lanka for power sharing in the north and east of Sri Lanka. The proposals were made in-lieu of the LTTE renouncing its claim for an independent country called Tamil Eelam for the minority Sri Lankan Tamil people.
Background.
The Parliamentary elections of 5 December 2001 had resulted in a victory for the United National Front (UNF) alliance led by the United National Party (UNP). The UNP had campaigned on a pro-peace platform and pledged to find a negotiated settlement to the Sri Lankan civil war. Within days of the UNF victory the LTTE announced a 30-day ceasefire. This ceasefire was formalised on 22 February 2002 when the UNF Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the LTTE signed a Norwegian mediated permanent ceasefire agreement. In September 2002 peace talks began in Phuket, Thailand but in April 2003 the LTTE suspended talks citing a number of reasons.
The ISGA.
On 31 October 2003, with the ceasefire still holding, the LTTE issued their proposals for an ISGA. The ISGA would have broad powers such the right to impose the rule of law, collect taxes, run the administration and oversee the rehabilitation process in the north and east, and it would be controlled by the LTTE until elections were held. Crucially however, the LTTE had dropped their demand for an independent Tamil Eelam in favour of regional autonomy. The key points of the LTTE's proposals are:
Reaction.
International reaction to the LTTE's proposals was generally positive. US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage gave a cautious welcome, saying that the proposal is "the first time I have seen such a comprehensive delineation of the aspirations of the LTTE...it is significant". The European Union's Head of Mission in Colombo welcomed the proposals as an "important step forward in the peace process".
Sri Lankan reaction was mixed. The GOSL reacted by stating that the proposal "differs in fundamental respects from the proposals submitted by the GOSL. The GOSL is convinced that the way forward lies through direct discussion of the issues arising from both sets of proposals". The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main political party representing Sri Lankan Tamils, welcomed the proposals positively. R. Sampanthan, leader of the TNA, said "The ISGA proposal..bears historical importance in the political history of Tamils in the island. The ISGA provides a base to find a permanent political solution to the Tamil national question". The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the main opposition party in the Sri Lankan Parliament, expressed grave concern over ISGA proposals saying ""it will never be a party to robbing the people of Sri Lanka of their sovereignty. Reaction from Sri Lankan nationalists, led by the People's Liberation Front (JVP), was very hostile - they considered the LTTE's proposals de facto Tamil Eelam. The JVP said the proposals deserve no discussions with any one and should be thrown into waste paper basket. The JVP pointed out that the proposal contained all powers required for a separate state in the island. The Sihala Urumaya (SU) appealed to the UNF government to terminate the peace talks with LTTE on the basis of the contents of the proposals, which the SU said will lead to the formation of a separate state.
On 4 November 2003, while Prime Minister Wickremasinghe was out of the country, President Kumaratunga, who is from the SLFP, suspended Parliament, took control of the Ministries of Defence, Interior and Information and ordered troops to key installations. The next day the President declared a state of emergency. On 7 February 2004 the President dissolved Parliament and called for elections on 2 April. The elections were won by a SLFP-JVP alliance.

The Wall (band)

The Wall were a punk rock band formed in Wallsend, Tyne & Wear, England, in early 1978. They released two albums while together.
History.
Formed in early 1978, the initial line-up was Ian Lowery (vocals), Andzy Griffiths (bass, vocals), John Hammond (lead guitar, vocals), and Bruce Archibald (drums), and this line-up recorded the band's debut single, "New Way", which was issued in April 1979. Played regularly by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, the single sold more than 10,000 copies. This success led Lowery and Griffiths to relocate to London, although Hammond and Archibald didn't follow them and were replaced by Nick Ward on guitar, and by Rab Fae Beith, former drummer with Patrik Fitzgerald (who The Wall had toured with) and The Pack. After meeting Paul Cook and Steve Jones, the two former Sex Pistols decided they wanted to work with the band, and produced the next single, "Exchange", The Wall becoming the first punk band to be produced by an ex Pistol. Rab became the band's manager, and when their first label Small Wonder ceased operating, he got them a deal with Fresh Records and went into the studio to record the next single "Ghetto". Although originally recorded with Lowery on vocals, it would be re-recorded with new singer Ivan Kelly (formerly of Ruefrex). Lowery had decided that Ward should be replaced, but the rest of the band disagreed and instead decided that Lowery should go. Lowery went on to form Ski Patrol (with Archibald) and The Folk Devils, as well as recording solo work. He died in 2001. Former Straps guitarist Andy "Heed" Forbes was also added to the line-up when Ward decided to leave the band. The debut album, "Personal Troubles and Public Issues" was released in late 1980. After an unprovoked drunken attack by Kelly on an elderly man while the band were walking through London, the singer was immediately sacked from the band, with Griffiths taking over on vocals. The band were given a support slot on the Stiff Little Fingers "Go For It" national tour, which was a great success and recorded the "Remembrance" EP to coincide with the dates, with a stand-in bassist playing in the live shows. On returning from the tour, Claire Bidwell of The Passions joined on bass guitar, leaving Griffiths free to concentrate on vocals. The band's second album, "Dirges and Anthems" was released in April 1982, the band now signed to Polydor Records. Polydor insisted that "Epitaph" be released as a single, but it was outsold by the "Hobby for a Day" EP released on Fresh Records shortly before, and the band were dropped by Polydor. The Wall were reduced to a duo of Beith and Griffiths, who soldiered on for one last effort, the "Day Tripper" EP in late 1982, before the group split up for good.
Beith had a short spell with And Also the Trees before joining UK Subs in 1984, and running his own RFB record label. He later worked as a motorcycle mechanic. 
A collection of the band's independent releases was issued in 1998 on Captain Oi!.
In August 2007, the band reformed for a headline appearance at the Blackpool Rebellion with 7 of the original members,
Andzy Griffiths (vocals), Nick Ward (guitars), Al Gregg (guitars & bass), Andrew Forbes (guitars), John Hammond (guitars), 
Claire Bidwell (bass) and Mark Dyvig (drums) with a warm-up gig the previous night at The Thatched House in Stockport.
This was followed by the release of a new live album in August 2009 on Captive Records (Opus Productions/Captive Records).

Stonham Aspal

Stonham Aspal is a village and civil parish in the Mid Suffolk district of Suffolk in eastern England. Located around five miles east of Stowmarket, in 2011 its population was 601.
The village has a public house and a primary school.
In 1870s, Stonham Aspal was described as:
History.
The village dates back to the Roman Hypocaust era. The name of Stonham Aspal in the 13th century is directly translated as 'Stone homestead'. Many of the houses in the village are 14th and 15th century. The main industry in the village according to census data from 1881 for males was agriculture. 
Stonham Aspal is mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Estuna', in the Bosmere hundred of Suffolk. It is made up of 2 villagers, 4 small holders and 11 free men. 1.5 lord's plough teams and 2 men's plough teams are also mentioned. It has a meadow of 7 acres, woodland of 80 pigs, 1 church and 0.11 church lands. In 1066 the lord was Aelmer. In 1086 the lord was Miles de Belefol. 
Stonham Aspal has undergone many boundary changes over time. It was originally part of the Bosmere registration district until 1935, when it was abolished the village joined the Gipping registration district transferring a population of 14427 in total from the Bosmere registration district. In 1983 Gipping abolished and Stonham Aspal joined Gipping & Hartismere registration district. This abolished in 2010 and from this point Stonham Aspal has been part of the Suffolk registration district. 
Census Data for Stonham Aspal dates back to 1801. The earliest recoded population total at this time was 578. The highest figure to be recorded by the Census was in 1851 with a total population of 814. The lowest recorded being in 1961 with a total population of 418, just over half the highest recorded figure. 
The main industry recorded for the village in 1881 was in Agriculture, taking a total of around 39%. In 2011 Census this figure had dropped to 6%. This would be due to Britains shift from primary work to secondary and tertiary sector jobs. This will also explain why now the highest percentage in industry is around 14% for manufacturing jobs. 
Housing.
Stonham Aspal is in The Stonhams district ward, described by the Office of National Statistics as a 'village surrounded by inhabited countryside'. The main housing type is Detached, Semi Detached, flats and terraced, with housing ownership being private and social housing. The average house price sale from August 2013 to January 2014 for the area was £221,458.33, the majority being detached at an average price of £265,800. 
The local school is the Stonham Aspal church of England voluntary aided primary school. The school is for ages 5-11, and had 189 pupils on roll for the school year September 2013 to July 2014. The school achieved a total of 97% of students in 2013 achieving Level 4 or above in reading, writing and maths, improving 7% from the previous year. A school inspection done by Ofsted on 15 January 2013 rated the school 'Good'.

Roger de Bailleul

Roger de Bailleul (died 25 September 1179) was a medieval Benedictine monk, abbot of Bec, and archbishop-elect of Canterbury.
He was born in Lombardy, but according to the Gallia Christiana he was a native of Bailleul (although which one has not been identified), hence the name given to him. However, Robert du Mont confirms it was Lombardy.
He became a monk of the Abbey of Our Lady of Bec, Normandy and skilful jurist, teaching civil and canon law in England. As a supporter of the Empress Matilda against Stephen of Blois in the succession to the throne of England, he attracted royal opposition, and had to return to the abbey in Normandy.
After the death of Abbot Létard, Roger was elected the seventh abbot of Bec on 6 July 1149, and blessed by Archbishop Hugh of Rouen on 25 July 1149.
As the head of the rich Norman abbey, Roger began to renovate the abbey church, whose first stone was laid by Rotrou, Bishop of Évreux on 14 August 1161 and its consecration was celebrated in April 1178 before King Henry II of England. Roger also had a hospital built, which included one of the rooms for travellers, renovated the dormitory, and dug canals to carry water from two sources to the monastic apartments.
With the other bishops and abbots of Normandy, he attended the ceremony at Avranches of the absolution of King Henry II for the murder of Thomas Becket. In February 1173, Roger was elected to succeed as archbishop of Canterbury by the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, but he declined the election. He was formally absolved from the election on 5 April 1173.
He died at Bec Abbey on 25 September 1179.

Brough Superior SS80

The Brough Superior SS80 was a motorcycle designed and built by George Brough of Brough Superior in Nottingham, UK from 1924 to 1939. Described by "The Motor Cycle" as "The Rolls-Royce of Motor Cycles", production ended with the outbreak of World War II in 1939.
Development.
The SS80 (Super Sports) model was developed in 1920, soon after George Brough set up Brough Superior. The SS80's model designation was based on Brough's guarantee that it could reach . Finished to a standard that put it well beyond the reach of most motorcyclists, the SS80 set out the key features of all Brough Superior models to follow. Thirty-two SS80s were built in 1935. Early models used the J.A.P. sidevalve engine which was expected to be superseded by the overhead valve Brough Superior SS100 when it was introduced at the end of 1924, but SS80 sales continued well and in 1935 the SS80 was fitted with the Matchless V-twin engine, similar to the one fitted to the Matchless Model X but with Brough's modified big end arrangement. Before production ended with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, 1,086 SS80's were manufactured in total, of which 460 were Matchless-engined.
SS80 De Luxe.
The SS80 "De Luxe" specification included a fully sprung rear wheel, bottom link front forks, a patented rolling stand, pillion footrests and a specially tuned engine.
Racing success.
George Brough used an SS80 he nicknamed 'Spit and Polish' (so called because of the immaculate finish he always maintained) to become the first sidevalver to lap the Brooklands track at over . The same motorcycle went on to win 51 out of 52 races. The only time it failed to win was due to a puncture. 
Brough became famous as a competition rider and only retired from racing following a serious crash which left him recovering for eight months in hospital receiving skin grafts, as he never wore protective clothing.

Routes of City of Buffalo Streetcars

1916 (post WW I).
After the amalgamation of a number of streetcar companies during the early start of the 20th century, the International Railway Company began assignment of route numbers to virtually all of its routes it operated. Some truncated versions (such as ""Abt"" for Abbott Road, and ""Bst"" for Best Street) remained, but were slowly assigned numbers, similar to the current route numbers used in today's NFTA Metro routes.
1935 (late-depression years).
Shortly after 1935, major changes were becoming evident, with elimination of streetcar service on virtually all west-side lines, including (from west to east) 5-Niagara, 3-Grant, 7-Hoyt and 20-Elmwood streetcars, and (from north to south) 10-West Utica, and 22-Connecticut streetcars.
Post-1940, the only streetcar that crossed Main Street, continuing westbound, was the 23-Fillmore/Hertel car operating between South Park Avenue in South Buffalo and Tonawanda Street using a loop over Tonawanda, Grace, Niagara and Hertel. 
Later half of the 1930s (the start of the decline of streetcars).
Shortly after 1935, the removal of streetcar lines became more evident after the introduction of new routes being operated with buses, instead of introducing new streetcar lines.
The first group of streetcar routes that reappeared as bus routes were the westside lines, easy to explain with the narrowness of the streets and their zigzagging over the courses of many streets. The routes that fell to bus service include:
In addition, elsewhere:
1940s & 1950s (the last decade of streetcar service).
In 1941, four streetcar lines ended service.
After these dates, World War II had set in, creating a six-year gap in the escalation of lost streetcar routes, due to the shortage of manpower to fix the newly implemented buses, and from the scarcity of precious metal that was being used in wartime production of supplies.
At this time, the International Railway Company encouraged the riding public to return to the use of streetcars and support them in their cooperation with the war cause.
In 1947 and 1948, removal of streetcar service began again.
In 1950, the final six streetcar routes ended service, replaced immediately by buses.
After the end of passenger service, the Niagara Frontier Transit Corporation spent approximately six months removing the remaining 175 streetcars from the Cold Springs and Broadway streetcar barns over the remaining streetcar trackage on Broadway, Fillmore Avenue, Main Street and Hertel to the Military car barn where the outer bodies were removed and burned.
The streetcar tracks were usually covered up with asphalt, and occasionally during major road work, construction crews may dig up remains of tracks that have been buried under mere inches or feet for the past fifty years.
At the present time, Main Street (NYS 5) is undergoing extensive reconstruction of the roadbed and in areas of roadway that were not dug up during the construction of the Metro Rail line (using tunnel boring instead), the tracks are being brought back to the surface and dismantled.
Metro Rail (1985-present).
Though termed a "light rail subway", the Metro Rail is worthy of mention in that the portion operating in Downtown Buffalo from the Theater to Erie Canal Harbor stations operates similar to a normally run streetcar service.
The route originates in Downtown Buffalo on Main Street at Erie Canal Harbor Station (previously Auditorium), just north of Scott and Hanover Streets. The light rail line continues north, then north-east along Main Street, stopping at 6 above-ground stations in Downtown Buffalo, then 8 underground stations (like a subway) until arriving at University Station, located a brief distance northeast of Niagara Falls Boulevard.

Kepler Cascades

Kepler Cascades is a waterfall on the Firehole River in southwestern Yellowstone National Park in the United States. The cascades are located approximately 2.5 miles south of Old Faithful. The cascades drop approximately 150 feet over multiple drops. The longest drop is 50 feet. The cascades are located very near to and visible from the Old Faithful to West Thumb road.
History.
The Kepler Cascades were described by the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in 1870 but not named until 1881. In his 1871 report to the Secretary of War, Gustavus C. Doane, a member of the expedition described Kepler Cascades as:
September 18 . -- We broke camp at 9 o'clock, traveling along the slopes of the ridges, skirting the ravines through falling timber, and passing in many places over swampy terraces, for a distance of three miles, when we suddenly came upon a mountain torrent, 40 feet wide, and running through a gorge of trachyte lava 200 feet in depth. This was the Firehole River, heading in a lake a few miles to the south. Following down the course of this stream we presently passed two fine roaring cascades, where the water tumbled over rocks to the depth of 20 and 50 feet successively. These pretty little falls, if located on an eastern stream, would be celebrated in history and song; here, amid objects so grand as to strain conception and stagger belief, they were passed without a halt. 
The cascades were named by Philetus Norris, park superintendent in 1881 for the 12 year old son of Wyoming's territorial governor John Wesley Hoyt. Hoyt and his son, Kepler Hoyt, were visiting Yellowstone in 1881 when Norris named the cascades after Kepler.

Lipnica Castle

Lipnica Castle (, ), also known as Deserted Castle above the Lipnica ("Pusti grad nad Lipnico"), is a castle ruin near the settlement of Lipnica in the Upper Carniola (northwestern Slovenia), above a creek of the same name, in the Municipality of Radovljica.
History.
The castle was once the seat of the Upper Carniolan holdings of the noble house of Ortenburg. First mentioned in 1263 as "castrum Waldemberch", it was administered by the knights of Waldenberg, themselves first recorded in 1228 with a Fridericus de Waldenberch.
After the death of Count Friderik III of Ortenburg in 1418 at the castle, the lordship of Lipnica was inherited by the counts of Celje; after their extinction in 1456 the castle became a ducal holding. Its castellans included the houses of Heunsberg, Dulacer, Velacer and Stain (of Kamen pri Begunjah), and the Lambergs. The lordship of Lipnica was managed by the Kacijanar family, the counts of Dietrichstein, and others, until the counts of Thurn merged it with Radovljica around 1600.
Lipnica Castle had been abandoned by then, having burned down in the 16th century and not deemed worth repairing. The core of the ruins consists of an impressive Romanesque palacium, likely dating to the 12th century.
In culture.
In 1939, the writer Josip Lavtižar set a historical novel at the castle. It is also the setting of the play "Pusti grad" ("Deserted Castle") by Polona Škrinjar.

Artistic Gymnastics World Cup

The Artistic Gymnastics World Cup is a competition for artistic gymnastics sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). The gymnasts are invited based on the results from the previous World Championships or Olympics Games and the winners are awarded prize money.
History.
In 1975, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) sporadically decided to organise an original competition, reserved for the current best gymnasts. It was composed of a single and unique event, bringing together very few gymnasts in all around competition and in apparatus finals, giving just the slightest hint of a gala.
This atypical competition was therefore entitled the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup. This initiative was taken in a particular context, since the world championships took place merely every 4 years.
This schedule was kept until 1990, the year in which the world championships cycle was modified.
In 1997, the FIG Executive Committee updated and made its international calendar consistent and took the decision to hold a World Cup Final (in even years) in alternance with the World Championships (in odd years).
At the FIG Council in Cape Town (RSA) in May 2008, the members decided no longer to run any world cup and series finals for all FIG disciplines from January 2009.

Ohio Sky Survey

The Ohio Sky Survey was an astronomical survey of extragalactic radio sources. Data were taken between 1965 and 1971 using the Big Ear radio telescope at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory (OSURO), also known as the "Big Ear Radio Observatory (BERO)". 
The survey covered 94% of the sky area between the limiting declinations of 63°N and 36°S with a resolution at 1415 MHz of 40 arc minutes in declination. The survey was carried out primarily at a frequency of 1415 MHz but observations were also made at 2650 MHz and 612 MHz. Roughly 19,620 sources were identified over the course of the survey of which 60% were previously uncatalogued. 
The survey was unique in that it covered a larger portion of the sky, to a greater depth, and at a higher frequency, than any previous survey. In addition, all previously catalogued sources were tabulated and maps of the areas surveyed were included with the positions of all catalogued sources.
Sources discovered in the course of the survey were assigned names according to a coordinate numbering system consisting of a two-letter prefix followed by three digits. The first letter, O, stood for Ohio, and the second letter, B-Z inclusive (omitting O) indicated the source right ascension in hours (0-23 inclusive). The first digit indicated the declination zone in increments of 10°, while the last two digits give the right ascension to the nearest one-hundredth of an hour. 
Data reduction for the survey was done using a computer program developed by John D. Kraus and Robert S. Dixon.
The Ohio Sky Survey was published in seven installments and two supplements.

New Cavendish Club

The New Cavendish Club is a London private members' club, run along the lines of a traditional gentlemen's club, although it was originally founded as a Ladies'-only club. It is located at 44-48 Great Cumberland Place in the Fitzrovia district. 
History.
It was founded in 1920 by Margaret Russell, Lady Ampthill in her capacity as Chairman of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of nurses during World War I, and was intended to be "a first class Ladies' Club" for veteran nurses of the VAD. 
The club opened with its inaugural dinner on 14 June 1920, with a 999-year lease acquired on premises at Queen Anne House, 28 Cavendish Square. The building was formerly Marshall Thomson's Hotel, which is described in William Makepeace Thackeray's " Vanity Fair ". The club's dining room was originally staffed by VAD veterans from the war. The Cavendish Square building was damaged by a fire bomb during the Blitz.
In 1957, the club sold its clubhouse, and moved in 1959 to its new premises in Great Cumberland Place, which required extensive modernisation - bomb damage from the war meant that the interior had to be almost entirely rebuilt from scratch. Between vacating the old building in September 1958 and moving to the new one in December 1959, the club's members were welcomed at several other London clubs on a temporary basis.
After the move, membership was then offered to members of the defunct Cowdray Club and Guide Club, as well as women of the Magistrates Association and the Women's Voluntary Service. Men were also finally admitted.
As of 2010, the membership subscription costs £375 per year. The entrance fee is an additional £175[http://www.newcavendishclub.co.uk/membership.php].

Zheng Xunyu

Zheng Xunyu (鄭珣瑜) (738 – December 11, 805), courtesy name Yuanbo (元伯), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Dezong and Emperor Shunzong.
Background.
Zheng Xunyu was born in 738, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). It claimed ancestry from the ducal house of the Spring and Autumn Period state Zheng and traced its ancestry through a line of officials of Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265–420), Han Zhao or Later Zhao, Former Yan or Later Yan, Northern Wei, Northern Zhou, and Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Zheng Changyu (鄭長裕) served as a prefectural prefect, while his father Zheng Liang (鄭諒) served as a county magistrate.
Zheng Xunyu lost his father prematurely. After the Anshi Rebellion erupted in 755, he took his mother into Mount Luhun (陸渾山, in modern Luoyang, Henan) and supported his mother there, not returning to Zheng Prefecture. After the rebellion was quelled, there were three occasions when the officials Liu Yan and Zhang Xiancheng (張獻誠) recommended him to be an official at the county level, and each time he declined the recommendation. During the "Dali" era (766–779) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, Zheng passed the imperial examinations in the special class of those who submitted constructive criticism. He was made "Dali Pingshi" (大理評事), a judge at the supreme court (大理寺, "Dali Si"). He was later made the secretary general at Yangzhai County (陽翟, in modern Xuchang, Henan), and, after he served with distinction there, was made the sheriff of Wannian County (萬年, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), one of the two counties making up the Tang capital Chang'an.
During Emperor Dezong's reign.
After Cui Youfu became chancellor in 779 during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Cui promoted Zheng Xunyu to be "Zuo Bujue" (左補闕), a low-level consultant at the examination bureau of government (門下省, "Menxia Sheng"). He later served as a secretary to the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Jingxuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), and then returned to Chang'an to serve as an imperial censor with the title "Shiyushi" (侍御史) then "Xingbu Yuanwailang" (刑部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, "Xingbu"). He later left governmental service to observe a mourning period for his mother when she died, and after the mourning period was over, he was moved to the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, "Libu"). Early in Emperor Dezong's "Zhenyuan" era (785–805), he made an order that 10 central government officials be made magistrates of various counties in the Chang'an and Luoyang regions, and Zheng, while retaining his office, was made the magistrate of Fengxian County (奉先, near Chang'an). The next year, he was made the prefect of Rao Prefecture (饒州, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), and later returned to Chang'an to serve as "Jianyi Daifu" (諫議大夫), a high-level consultant; and then was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, "Libu Shilang").
Later, Zheng was made the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the Luoyang region). Before he could arrive at Henan, there was a birthday for Emperor Dezong, and it was customary for the mayors of the special municipalities to offer horses as tributes. A subordinate of Zheng's requested that he be permitted to fetch a horse to be offered, but Zheng refused, stating, "It is appropriate for someone who has not started serving to offer tributes?" It was also said that Zheng was serious and quiet in his character, and that he did not ask private favors of others; as a result, people did not dare to ask him for private favors. Once he arrived at Henan, he governed the city without much fanfare, and rested the people by lowering taxes and increasing stipends. At that time, the general Han Quanyi (韓全義) was in charge of attacking the rebel general Wu Shaocheng. Henan was responsible for shipping the army's supplies to Han, and Zheng responded by storing food at Yangzhai, reducing the burden of the people in shipping the supplies. Whenever Han and the eunuchs monitoring the army had demands on Henan, Zheng would not agree with those demands unless there were imperial edicts authorizing them. When his subordinates worried for him that this would offend Han and the eunuchs, Zheng responded:
Zheng's capability in governing the city was compared to a predecessor, Zhang Yanshang, but he was said to be more serious, lenient, and righteous than Zhang. He was later recalled to serve as deputy minister of civil service affairs again. In 803, he was given the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor, along with Gao Ying. At that time, one of Emperor Dezong's close associates, Li Shi (李實) the Prince of Dao, was the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the Chang'an region), and Li was well known for being harsh in his tax collections in order to offer tributes to Emperor Dezong. Zheng, disliking the practice, questioned him:
At that time, however, Li was trusted by Emperor Dezong, and therefore suffered no ill consequences from Zheng's investigation.
During Emperor Shunzong's and Emperor Xianzong's reigns.
In 805, Emperor Dezong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shunzong. Emperor Shunzong made Zheng Xunyu the minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, "Libu Shangshu") and still a chancellor. At that time, Emperor Shunzong's close associate Wang Shuwen had become very powerful and was allied with Zheng's chancellor colleague Wei Zhiyi. On an occasion, when the chancellors, as per custom, were having lunch together, Wang wanted to see Wei and went to the office of the chancellors to do so. When a guard refused to let Wang in, Wang rebuked the guard and ordered him away. Wei rose from his seat and walked away to confer with Wang. Zheng, and the other chancellors Du You and Gao Ying, stopped dining and waited for Wei to return. After a while, they sent the guard to see what the situation was, and the guard stated, "Wang Shuwen had requested food, and Chancellor Wei is dining with him." Neither Du nor Gao dared to say anything, but Zheng stated, "How can I remain here still?" He had his attendants fetch horses, and he went home and stayed there for seven days, refusing to leave his bed. Several months later, when Emperor Shunzong, then seriously ill, passed the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong, Zheng and Gao were removed as chancellors. Zheng himself died several months later and was given posthumous honors and the posthumous name "Wenxian" (文獻, meaning "civil and wise"). His sons Zheng Tan and Zheng Lang later served as chancellors during the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Xuānzong, respectively.

Evangeline Downs

Evangeline Downs Racetrack & Casino is a racetrack in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, just east of Opelousas. It is owned and operated by Boyd Gaming. With a seven furlong oval track, the facility provides close to 1,000 horse stalls for Thoroughbred flat racing and American Quarter Horse racing. The original track opened on April 28, 1966 at Carencro, Louisiana and remained there until 2005 when it moved to Opelousas, Louisiana. 
History.
In 1982, Rodney Verret, Ted Haik, Sam Rankin, and Joe Jones bought the track for $12.4 million.
In 1985, they sold it to Norman Denny and Larry Willis for $16.5 million. Denny and Willis soon ran into financial problems. After a missed payment of purse money, the Louisiana Racing Commission threatened to shut down the track. Evangeline Downs was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and closed indefinitely in October 1986. Unable to negotiate a reorganization, Denny and Willis shifted to Chapter 7 liquidation, asking a court to sell the track.
The Louisiana Savings Association, primary mortgage holder for the property, bought it at auction for the minimum bid of $333,335. Races resumed in April 1987.
Evangeline Downs added video poker machines in 1992. After Lafayette voters banned the game in 1996, the track made plans to move to St. Landry Parish, whose voters had rejected a ban.
In February 2002, Peninsula Gaming bought a fifty percent interest in the track from B. I. Moody for $15 million. They bought the remaining half several months later from William Trotter for another $15 million, plus 0.5% of slot revenues for the first ten years. Peninsula carried out the move to Opelousas, opening a casino at the new site in late 2003, with races following in 2005. Peninsula was acquired by Boyd Gaming in November 2012.
In 2009, the Horseplayers Association of North America introduced a rating system for 65 thoroughbred racetracks in North America. Of the top ten, Evangeline Downs was ranked #6.
Notable races.
On September 5, 1977, U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, John Henry won his first-ever stakes race at Evangeline Downs, capturing the Lafayette Futurity.
A number of notable jockeys began their professional careers at this track, including Robby Albarado, Ronald Ardoin, Calvin Borel, Curt Bourque, Eddie Delahoussaye, Kent Desormeaux, Mark Guidry, Kenneth Robinson, Randy Romero, Shane Sellers, Ray Sibille, and James E. Avant. Curt Bourque and Kenneth Robinson share the record for most wins in a single race card, winning six races each in 1988 and 1995 respectively.

Tarren y Gesail is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales. It is one of the Marilyns of the Cadair Idris group.
Lying to the south of Cadair Idris, it and its neighbour Tarrenhendre form the bulk of the Tarren subgroup. The Tarrens rise from the south shore of the Tal-y-llyn Lake and end at the Dyfi estuary.
The summit is a grassy ridge, which has a cairn and trig point. The views are extensive to the south and east, with Plynlimon and Cardigan Bay ahead, while the north views are dominated by Cadair Idris and Maesglase to the west. 
The Tarrerns can be thought of as forgotten mountains of Snowdonia, overshadowed by the popularity of Cadair Idris, occupying the sleepy south-eastern frontier of the national park.

Northwestern Knitting Company Factory building

The Northwestern Knitting Company Factory, also known as Munsingwear Corporation and later as International Market Square, is a former factory building in the Sumner-Glenwood neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The company was founded in 1888 by George D. Munsing, who invented a method of plating wool fibers with silk and cotton to make the union suit more comfortable. The company received financial backing from Clinton Morrison and Charles Alfred Pillsbury, who were prominent businessmen in the Minneapolis flour milling industry. This style of underwear, patented in 1891, proved to be very popular, and the company eventually became the world's largest manufacturer of underwear. The company changed its name in 1919 to Munsingwear.
The company built five brick and concrete buildings between 1904 and 1915, eventually creating a complex covering and employing up to 2000 workers. The five- to eight-story buildings had long rows of windows, and although the buildings mostly had a plain appearance, the architects added some details such as slightly projecting cornices, fretwork friezes, and fluted Doric columns. The oldest of the buildings, along Glenwood Avenue, is notable for being the city's first entirely reinforced concrete building. Engineer C.A.P. Turner used concrete columns shaped like a mushroom on top, and he eventually patented this process, which was widely used.
The factory eventually closed in 1981 when the economy reduced demand for Munsingwear's products. In 1985, the buildings were renovated and the complex was renamed International Market Square, which housed offices, shops, and over 100 showrooms for home and office products. The renovation included a five-story atrium created by roofing over an old courtyard where rail tracks once served the complex. In 2005, some portions of the building were renovated into 96 loft apartments. This was a leading example of adaptive reuse in Minneapolis. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Krimulda Castle

The Krimulda Castle is located just outside Sigulda, Sigulda municipality, Latvia and is a tourist attraction. The castle dates from the 14th century and was destroyed in a war in 1601.
Prince Liven’s living house was built in the classic style. The manor complex consists of steward’s house, coach house, Swiss cottage, etc. Home wine tasting is available by prior arrangement.
History.
During the 13th century the left bank of the Gauja river was governed by the Order of the Brethren of the Sword, (later known as the Order of Livonia), while the territories on the right bank were under the domain of the Archbishop of Riga. Krimulda castle belonged to the Riga High Council which was a group of twelve high priests who advised the archbishop.
Krimulda castle was built on the edge of a high bank on the right side of Gauja near the Vikmeste castle mound and the village of Livs. This placement made it nearly impossible to conquer. On one side it was protected by the steep valley wall of Gauja river, two additional sides were obstructed by the Vikmeste river, which had equally steep banks, and the fourth side bordered on a man-made ravine with a draw-bridge leading into the forecastle. The deep valley of the Vikmeste River also provided a natural borderline between the lands of Krimulda and Turaida.
The castle was built using large-sized boulders. The outer wall of the castle at ground level was about 2 meters/6-7 feet thick.
The castle was involved in a number of battles between the Livonian Order and the Archbishop of Riga as well as many of the later wars of Livonia. In the spring of 1601 during the Swedish-Polish war, it was conquered by the Swedish army. In the fall of that same year advancing Polish troops burned the castle down so it would not fall into the hands of the enemy. The castle was left unrepaired after the fire.
The castle regained purpose in the mid-19th century under the ownership of Prince Liven. Not as a military fortification but as a romantic addition to a park. From here you will find a beautiful overlook point, named 'Bellevue', where you can enjoy the numerous picturesque bends of the Gauja River.

2004 Ashdod Port bombings

The 2004 Ashdod Port bombings were two suicide bombings carried out nearly simultaneously on March 14, 2004 at the Port of Ashdod in Ashdod, Israel. 10 people were killed in the attack, and 16 were injured. Hamas and Fatah claimed joint responsibility for the attack.
The attack.
On Sunday, March 14, 2004, two Palestinian suicide bombers who wore explosive belts hidden underneath his clothes approached the Port of Ashdod. Despite the vast security arrangements at the compound, the two suicide bombers managed to infiltrate into the compound.
At 16:20 pm the suicide bombers detonated their explosive devices - one exploded himself in an office building inside the compound, and the other exploded after a few moments at the entrance to the compound. The force of the blast killed ten civilians, most of them were port workers, and injured 16 others.
The perpetrators.
Hamas and Fatah claimed joint responsibility for the attack and stated that the attack was carried out by two 18-year-olds from the Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. The two assailants managed to infiltrate Israel from Gaza by hiding in a container that went through the Karni Crossing. A Hamas leader in Gaza stated that the original plan was that the suicide bombers would blow up fuel tanks at the port; Israel said the bombers intended to carry out a "mega attack" with hundreds of casualties, but instead blew themselves up hundreds of meters from the tanks.
Later on it was revealed that the attack was financed and directed by Nizar Rayan.

The Year of the Flood

The Year of the Flood is a novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, released on September 22, 2009 in Canada and the United States, and on September 7, 2009, in the United Kingdom. The novel was mentioned in numerous newspaper review articles looking forward to notable fiction of 2009.
The book focuses on a group called God's Gardeners, a small community of survivors of the same biological catastrophe depicted in Atwood's earlier novel "Oryx and Crake". The earlier novel contained several brief references to the group.
It answers some of the questions of "Oryx and Crake" and reveals the identity of the three real human figures who appear at the end of the earlier book and sets the scene for the final book of the trilogy, "MaddAddam".
Plot.
"The Year of the Flood" details the events of "Oryx and Crake" from the perspective of the lower classes in the pleeblands, specifically the God's Gardeners. God's Gardeners are devoted to preserving all plant and animal life, and they predict a disaster (The Flood according to the Gardeners, known by the readers to be Crake's viral pandemic) will radically alter the Earth.
The plot follows two characters, Toby and Ren, whose stories intertwine with each other and, at points, with major characters from "Oryx and Crake". Much of the story is told through flashback with the two main characters separately surviving the apocalypse described in the previous novel, both reminiscing about their time in the God's Gardeners religious movements and the events that led to their current positions.
Toby is a young woman who loses her family, blaming the corporations, and is forced to work in a low-quality burger joint. She soon encounters the unwelcome attention of the brutish manager of the chain who is depicted as grooming and assaulting women in his employ. Adam One, depicted as a self-proclaimed messiah but perceived by outsiders as a cult leader, saves Toby from the manager and takes her to the sanctuary of his rooftop garden. Toby becomes an influential member of the gardeners and encounters Ren, a child member of the gardeners.
Ren eventually grows up to become a trapeze dancer in the sex club Scales and Tails, and happens to be locked in a bio-containment unit in the club when the pandemic occurs. Similarly, Toby is barricaded within a luxury spa where she has begun to work following the gardeners raid.
Main characters.
Oryx, Crake and Jimmy appear in cameo roles over the course of the book with the protagonists Ren and Toby unaware that these characters are eventually responsible for the pandemic. Notably, while the first book shows the world through the eyes of Jimmy and women are reduced to one-dimensional characters; here the women, Ren and Toby, are fully realised characters while Jimmy and Crake are only shown through the women's obfuscated perspective.
Promotion.
Atwood's tour to promote the book included choral performances of 14 religious hymns that appear in the book.
Naming rights.
For both "Oryx and Crake" and "The Year of the Flood", Atwood donated naming rights to characters in the novel to charity auctions. One of the winning bidders was journalist Rebecca Eckler, who paid $7,000 at a benefit for the magazine "The Walrus".
Reception.
The novel was generally well-received; reviewers noted that while the plot was sometimes chaotic, the novel's imperfections meshed well with the flawed reality the book was trying to reflect. "The Daily Telegraph" commented that "Margaret Atwood is genuinely inventive, rather than merely clever".
In 2010, the novel was longlisted as a candidate for the 2011 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and shortlisted for the 2010 Trillium Book Award.
The novel was selected for inclusion in the 2014 edition of CBC Radio's "Canada Reads", where it will be defended by Stephen Lewis.

Blas Monaco

Blas Monaco (November 16, 1915 – February 10, 2000) was an American professional baseball player who had a long career (1935–1944; 1946–1949) in minor league baseball interrupted by two brief Major League trials almost nine years apart with the Cleveland Indians in and . The native of San Antonio, Texas, an infielder, threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .
Monaco appeared in only 17 games in the Major Leagues, and collected two hits in 13 at bats, with one extra-base hit, a triple, and two runs batted in. His two hits and lone RBI came in his big league debut on August 18, 1937, at Sportsman's Park against the St. Louis Browns. In that game, Monaco pinch hit for starting second baseman John Kroner and went two-for-two and played errorless ball in the field, in an 11–6 Cleveland defeat. He would go hitless in his remaining 11 MLB at bats (five in 1937 and six in 1946), starting his only game as a second baseman four days after his debut, and going 0-for-4 against Vern Kennedy of the Chicago White Sox. However, he again made no errors in the game, which was won by the Indians, 3–2. 
During his minor league career, Monaco played in over 1,400 games.

Tarrenhendre

Tarrenhendre is a mountain in Snowdonia, North Wales. It is one of the Marilyns in the Cadair Idris group.
Lying to the south of Cadair Idris, it and its neighbour Tarren y Gesail form the bulk of the Tarren subgroup. The Tarrens rise from the south shore of the Tal-y-llyn Lake and end at the Dyfi estuary.
The summit is heathery and boggy, and has a small cairn to mark the highest point. The views are extensive to the south and east, with Plynlimon and Cardigan Bay ahead, while the north views are dominated by Cadair Idris and Maesglase to the west. 
The Tarrens can be thought of as forgotten mountains of Snowdonia, overshadowed by the popularity of Cadair Idris, occupying the sleepy south-western frontier of the Snowdonia national park.

David Armstrong Six, born in 1968, is an artist from Toronto, Canada, working in Montreal since 2006. His work has been exhibited widely throughout Canada, the USA, Europe and New Zealand and is included in various collections including the collections of the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Musée National des Beaux-Arts du Québec, and the Musée d'art contemporain de Montreal. 
Armstrong Six's first solo exhibition entitled "Depth Sounding" which took place in Toronto (1996) was a pivotal point in the beginning of his artistic career. 
Since then he has participated in numerous solo exhibitions of which include "Leak into Space" in Toronto (2000); "Dog Leg Room" in Paris (2001); "The Cave and the Island" in Vienna (2004); "Teorias de Resistencia" in Madrid (2004); "I Wanna Be a Popstar" in Berlin (2004); "If Not for Today, Tomorrow" in New York (2005); and "Nothing is Lost, Nothing is Created, Everything is Transformed" at the Contemporary Art Museum in Montreal (2008); "Two Flies Later" in Toronto (2009), "The Dry Salvages" in Montreal at Parisian Laundry (2010) and The Biennale de Montréal. 
The work of David Armstrong Six draws upon a wide range of references and materials, resulting in an equally diverse yet decisive practice within the ambit of sculpture, drawings and video.Whether it be the use of fluorescent light fixtures to articulate a minimalist form, letting liquids leak from a false ceiling onto a gallery floor, or the unruly and humorously vitriolic performance of an original rap song, one may see in his practice a strategy for infecting culture through the tenuous nature of its prototypes.

Enoch Turner School

Enoch Turner Schoolhouse is an historic site and museum owned by the Ontario Heritage Trust. The school was built in 1848, when it was known as the Ward School. The building is located at 106 Trinity Street between King St. E. and Eastern Ave in Toronto, Ontario Canada.
History.
The original one-room school was established in 1848 by Enoch Turner (1792-1866), a wealthy brewer and philanthropist, to educate the children in the poor neighbourhood surrounding his brewery. Because many of the area's immigrant families were from County Cork in Ireland, the neighbourhood became known as Corktown – a nickname it still carries today.
Turner supplied the funds to construct the Schoolhouse and the land was donated by the adjacent Little Trinity Church. In 1849, the school opened with space for 240 pupils and Turner paid for its operation for three years. It was the first free school in Toronto.
Enoch Turner founded his free school following the Common Schools Act of 1846. After the act was passed, municipalities had the power to raise funds for public education through taxation. However, city officials were unwilling to introduce such taxes, and as a result, all schools that benefited from any kind of public support were closed for a year. This prompted Turner to establish the school, which was as a critical catalyst in the development of a provincially supported free school system.
In 1850, school trustees were elected by the public to oversee educational funding. Free public education officially began at the Trinity Street School in 1851. Daily class size ranged from 80 to 90 students of varying academic levels. There were several different instructors employed by the school trustees - most notably Mrs. Jane Henderson, a Scottish immigrant who taught from 1858-59. In 1859, classes were relocated to the nearby Palace Street School at Palace Street (now Front Street East) and Cherry Street. The Trinity Street School and property were returned to Little Trinity parish, and from the 1860s to the 1960s the school served as a parish hall and Sunday school for the church. In addition, the School and hall served as a recruiting station during the Second Boer War and the World War I, and a soup kitchen during the Great Depression. Due to a severe fire at Little Trinity Anglican Church in 1961, the parish could no longer afford to care for the school building, and it fell into disrepair. By the late 1960s, the building was slated for demolition.
To protect the building and raise funds for its restoration, a group of citizens together with members of the Little Trinity Church congregation set up the Enoch Turner Schoolhouse Foundation on October 8, 1970. The former Trinity Street School was renamed Enoch Turner Schoolhouse. After extensive interior and exterior renovations, the Schoolhouse opened as a living history site and conference and reception centre. In March 2008, the ownership and operation of the Schoolhouse were transferred to the Ontario Heritage Trust from the Foundation. The Enoch Turner Schoolhouse Foundation continues as an independent charitable organization, working with the Trust to support the programming and operation of the Schoolhouse. The museum is open for education programs by appointment and open to walk-in visitors during regular business hours.
Architectural Style.
The design of the one-story Gothic Revival style brick schoolhouse is attributed to architect Henry Bowyer Lane. In 1869, the building was expanded to the west with an addition designed by noted Toronto architectural firm Gundry and Langley. The addition is a particularly early work by Henry Langley, who opened his own practice that same year, following the death of Thomas Gundry. Langley went on to become one of the most influential 19th-century architects in Ontario, designing important Toronto landmarks such as the Metropolitan United Church (56 Queen Street East), McMaster Hall (273 Bloor Street West) and the Bank of British North America (49 Yonge Street).
Affiliations.
The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

Montenegrin identity card

Montenegrin identity card (Montenegrin: Lična karta/Лична карта ) is the national identification card used in Montenegro. Though "Lična karta" is a primary photo ID, Montenegrin passport and national driver's license are used as valid photo IDs for various purposes. It is issued to all Montenegrin citizens residing in the country above 16 years of age, while it's required for those over the age of 18.

On upper right corner there is small map of Montenegro in orange color which changes in other colors depending on angle of view (yellow, green). On the right side 2 letters are engraved "CG" (short of "Crna Gora") which you can see when rotating the card.
