Elections to Wiltshire County Council were held on 6 May 1993. The whole council was up for election and the result was no overall control, with the Liberal Democrats as the largest party. This resulted in a coalition administration of Liberal Democrats and Labour which continued for the whole four-year life of the council. 
When Swindon Borough Council was established as a new unitary authority on 1 April 1997, the members who had been elected to the county council from Haydon Wick, Highworth, Stratton St Margaret, Swindon, Wanborough, and Wroughton ceased to hold office. The size of the council fell from 68 to 47, and in the remaining month of the council's term of office the Liberal Democrats briefly took control, but they lost it at the Wiltshire Council election, 1997.

Central Mindanao University Laboratory High School

Central Mindanao University Laboratory High School or CMULHS, is a secondary school in Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon, Philippines. CMULHS is under the management of the Central Mindanao University - College of Education as a separate department, but it separately maintains its own set of administrators.
CMULHS has been used as a training ground for the College of Education's students who trains in the school as practicing high school instructors/teachers. Students who wish to enroll in CMULHS must first take and pass the "ULHSAT" or the "University Laboratory High School Admission Test". CMULHS rarely accept transferees.
History.
"Central Mindanao University Laboratory High School" traces its roots from a farm school organized by the Americans. It was established in 1910 as "Mailag Agricultural (Industrial) School" in Colonia, Mailag, Malaybalay ("now part of Valencia City") Bukidnon under "Santos Cudal", the head teacher. It offered the first four grades under the elementary agriculture curriculum and produced its first graduates in 1917. By virtue id Executive Order No. 59 dated December 18, 1918, the name of the school was changed to "Bukidnon Agricultural School" and offered the last three grades of the same curriculum with "Martin Callao" as its principal. In 1921, the school was transferred to Managok, Malaybalay City and was renamed "Bukidnon Rural High School" under Proclamation No. 30. The first batch of secondary agriculture students graduated in 1927.
By virtue of Act No. 337, the name was changed to "Bukidnon Agricultural High School", with the agriculture curriculum exclusive for its male students only. Commonwealth Act No. 313 gave the school a new name - "Bukidnon National Agricultural School", under "Dr. Felipe Cevallos" and "Nicodemes Flores" as superintendent and principal, respectively. This time, secondary homemaking curriculum was offered to female students with "Mrs. Esmeralda Collado Relis" as the first female to enroll. In 1943 to 1945, the school was closed due to World War II. After the warm the school reopened but due to the condition caused by the war, the school was then transferred to Musuan, Maramag, Bukindnon. On June 21, 1952, "President Elpidio Quirino" signed Republic Act 807 or "Mindanao Agricultural College Charter" which installed "Zosimo Montemayor" as president, with its high school department headed by "Narciso Pepeito".
On June 19, 1965 by virtue of Republic Act 4498, "Mindanao Agricultural College" was granted with its university status and was renamed "Central Mindanao University". The high school was then headed by "Felixberto Roquia". In 1965 to 1966, the general academic curriculum was introduced. "Ireneo Mendoza" was the acting head in 1968 to 1969 and "Leonardo Chua" in 1969 to 1970. In 1970 to 1971, both revised curricula implemented: vocational and general academic curriculum with "Leopoldo Roque" as principal. In June 1987, the "Vocational Agricultural Secondary Curriculum" was phased out and the "Science Curriculum" was implemented. In 1990 to 1996, the school operated in pure science curriculum. In 1996 to 2008, the science and general secondary curriculum was again implemented, having two sets of honor students. In 2008, the school again operated on pure science curriculum. 
Curriculum.
The current CMULHS curriculum is the former "Science Curriculum", a curriculum for those students who passed the ULHSAT at the top percentile ranks. 
Formerly, the curriculum had only 2 sections per year level. In 2005 the administration phased out the "New Secondary Curriculum (NSEC)" and replaced the NSEC section with a Science Curriculum section. As of 2008 the Science Curriculum is the only remaining curriculum offered in CMULHS. 
The school is using a science-based curriculum, which emphasizes and deals more with Sciences (General Science, Geology, Earth Sciences, Inorganic and Bio Chemistry, Biology, Genetics, Physics, and Environmental Sciences), and Mathematics (Algebra, Consumer Mathematics, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus, Computer Sciences, and Statistics).

Auguste François Marie Glaziou (August 30, 1828 – 1906) was a French landscape designer and botanist born in Lannion, Brittany.
As a student in Paris, he earned a degree in civil engineering and took classes at the "Muséum national d'histoire naturelle". In 1858 at the request of Emperor Dom Pedro II, he relocated to Rio de Janeiro as director of parks and gardens.
In Brazil, Glaziou was responsible for landscape design at several sites, including the gardens at Quinta da Boa Vista, the residence of Brazilian royalty for much of the 19th century. During his tenure in Brazil he also participated in widespread plant collecting. In 1897 he returned to France and settled in Bordeaux, where he worked on his personal herbarium.
The genus "Neoglaziovia" and numerous botanical species are named after him. With Antoine Laurent Apollinaire Fée (1789-1874), he was co-author of the two-volume "Cryptogames vasculaire (Fougères, lycopodiacées, hydroptéridées, équisétacées) du Brésil" (1869-1873).

My Dream – African Sounds is a 2008 release by the South African groups Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the SABC Choir. It was released on 30 September 2008. The album is a collaboration of both isicathamiya and choral music.
"My Dream – African Sounds" features songs composed by Mambazo founder, lead singer, and director Joseph Shabalala, and leader of the SABC Choir Thulasizwe Nkabinde. Original Mambazo songs (such as "Iqome Kanjani", "Shintsha Sithothobala", and "Angimboni Ofana Naye") as well as SABC Choir standards (like "Plea for Africa", "Uhembelinye", and "Buya Lindiwe") are included on the album, which melds both Zulu vocal music (isicathamiya) – made famous by Mambazo – and gospel choral musics by having both groups sing each song together. The one exception is "Okuhle Hle", sung entirely by Mambazo.
The album came together when Mambazo were on tour in the US in March 2007; South African Broadcasting Corporation executive Joyce Dube saw the group in a New York performance and approached them with the idea of recording a gospel/traditional album with the SABC Choir. Arrangements were made, and the album began to come together a year later in the South African Downtown Studios.

Lindsay Earle Hartwig (29 December 1919 – 2 April 1996) was an Australian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1972 to 1986, representing the electorate of Callide. He represented the seat as a National from 1972 to 1981, when he was expelled from the party; he thereafter sat as an independent until his retirement.
Hartwig was a farmer and grazier by occupation and pioneered the first aerial sowing of pasture seed. He began his political career as a councillor with the Shire of Monto (1961–1970) and was appointed chairman in 1964. He was preselected for the safe National seat of Callide in 1972 and was elected, winning re-election as a National in 1974, 1977 and 1980. In 1981, Hartwig was expelled from the National Party caucus by a vote of 33 to 2 for repeated criticism of party president Sir Robert Sparkes. He won re-election as an independent in 1983, but retired at the 1986 election. After leaving Parliament he became involved with the Liberal Party of Australia for a time and contested the 1988 South-Coast by-election for the fringe right-wing Citizens Electoral Council.
Hartwig was never appointed to state Cabinet but had a notable achievement in fighting successfully to have Queensland Day officially recognised.He also adopted a unique radio campaign. He put together a race-call commercial and called himself "Lovable Lindsay" who always won by a nose. Upon his death, his former colleagues made a range of tribute speeches; the stories of Hartwig's career were frequently humorous.

Washington, D.C. mayoral election, 2010

The Washington, D.C. mayoral election of 2010 took place on Tuesday, November 2, 2010. The primary elections occurred on September 14, 2010. Vincent Gray won the general election by a wide margin, although many voters wrote in incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty, whom Gray defeated in the primary.
Democratic primary.
Polls show incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty faced significantly reduced public support. On January 31, 2010, "The Washington Post" reported the results of a voter survey which showed that Fenty's job approval rating was at an all-time low of 42 percent. His support among African American voter support dropped to 29 percent from 68 percent, while his support among whites dropped to 57 percent from 78 percent. Fenty had a 42-percent job-approval rating, and more than four in 10 voters doubted his honesty, empathy, and openness.
Adrian Fenty's 2010 mayoral campaign is on pace to break every fundraising record in D.C. On July 31, 2009, prior to Vincent Gray entering the race, Fenty's campaign exceeded its 2006 primary fundraising total of $2.4 million. By June 2010, donors had given Fenty's campaign $4.2 million, while Gray had raised $561,000.
Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray officially entered the mayoral race on March 30, 2010, after long anticipation and speculation about his entrance. Running on the slogan "One City. Leadership We Need", Gray proclaimed that "DC can do better" to a crowd gathered at the Reeves Center the day of his announcement.
Some voters compliment Fenty for improvements in the District since he took office, while other voters criticize him for his aloof style. Some voters believe that as mayor, Gray would bring fiscal mismanagement and poor city services that existed in the early 1990s while he worked for the District government.
In his State of the District speech, Fenty noted improvements in students' test scores and a record-low rate homicide rate. Fenty also discussed the new psychiatric hospital at St. Edwards, new housing for homeless people, and a new recreation center in Deanwood. Fenty has contrasted the improvements in the District under his administration with the high crime rate and low school test scores in the 1990s. Fenty has also talked nearly a dozen new housing projects he facilitated that have brought about 11,000 affordable apartments to the District. Fenty has also pointed to the new supermarkets and restaurants that have opened in Wards 7 and 8 during his administration.
During an interview, Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools system Michelle Rhee said that she "could not imagine doing this job without the kind of unequivocal support" from Mayor Fenty. During another interview, Rhee said that Fenty "has not disappointed me one time in the last three years. I would not work under a mayor who was not focused on education in the same way, as dedicated to making some of the really difficult decisions. I think the chairman is certainly interested in education reform. I think that he...is committed to this city and its progress, certainly. But in terms of what I'm talking about with Mayor Fenty and his willingness to make some very difficult decisions, that though may have been unpopular with the adults, they are absolutely the right thing to do for the kids and for the system, no, I haven't seen the same thing with the chairman." 
Gray's campaign released an education plan, which included holding teachers accountable for student performance and paying them accordingly, strengthening the office of the deputy mayor for education, increasing infant and toddler care, and giving a tax credit for child and dependent care. Gray has said he would keep Rhee's reforms in place as mayor, but Gray has not said whether he would retain Rhee as chancellor.
Fenty has criticized Gray for his record as director of the Department of Human Services during former mayor Sharon Pratt's administration. During a local radio show, Fenty criticized Gray for mismanaging the Department of Human Services . Gray has responded to the criticism, saying that he enacted several improvements as director, including in the area of homelessness.
Leo Alexander has criticized Fenty for allowing teachers to be fired, and he criticized Gray for doing nothing to stop the firings as Council Chair. Alexander has said that both Gray and Fenty both want to keep the District generally the same as it is now. Gray responded that the Council had no authority to stop the firings, but Alexander recalled that former Council Chair John Ray had successfully done so during former mayor Marion Barry's administration. Alexander has also blamed businesses who hire illegal immigrants for the District's unemployment rate.
On September 15, 2010, the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics reported unofficial results, with Gray receiving 53 percent of the vote compared to Fenty's 46 percent. Gray won as much as 80% of the vote in predominantly black areas east of the Anacostia River, but did poorly in the city's wealthier northwest, winning just 13% in one Georgetown precinct.
Polling.
In a straw poll held by Ward 8 Democrats in May 2010, Fenty received the most votes. Fenty received 69 votes, Gray received 61 votes, and Alexander received 10 votes.
In a straw poll held by the District of Colombia Democratic State Convention in June 2010, Gray received the most votes. Gray received 703 votes, Fenty received 190, Alexander received 75, and other candidates received fewer than 10 votes each.
In a straw poll held in June 2010 that was open to Democrats in Ward 3, Gray received the most votes. Gray received 174 votes, Fenty received 168 votes, and Leo Alexander received 4 votes.
A straw poll held in Ward 2 in July 2010 resulted in 97 votes for Fenty, 63 votes for Gray, 1 vote for Alexander, 1 vote for Michael T. Green, and 1 undecided vote.
Ward 4 Democrats held a straw poll in Ward 4 in August 2010. Gray received 581 votes, Fenty received 401 votes, and Alexander received 12 votes.
"The Washington Post" questioned the reliability of straw polls to predict the winner of mayoral elections. Prior to the 2006 mayoral election, candidates Linda W. Cropp and Michael A. Brown won straw polls, but Fenty won every precinct in the actual Democratic primary election.
Other primaries and candidates.
Republican.
No Republican filed to run for the office, but Mayor Fenty received 822 write-in votes. However, since he was not a registered Republican on primary day, he was ineligible for the Republican nomination.
Statehood Green.
The Statehood Green Party candidate is Faith Dane, activist and former broadway performer
Socialist Workers Party.
The Socialist Workers Party candidate is Omari Musa
Independent.
Carlos Allen, former CEO of Hush Society Magazine, a philanthropic online magazine, is running for mayor as an independent. 
Also running as an independent was former NBC 4 reporter Leo Alexander.
General election.
Fenty endorsed Gray and said he has no interest in running as a Republican or independent.
Vincent Gray won the general election with over 70%, with write-in votes (mostly for Fenty) at over 20%. The three other candidates on the ballot (Carlos Allen, Faith, and Omari Musa) each won less than 2%.[http://www.dcboee.org/election_info/election_results/general_election_results/2010]

<doc id="20863062" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20863062" title="Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act">
Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act

The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act is the popular name of the portion of the California Civil Code beginning with section 1350, which governs condominium, cooperative, and planned unit development communities in California. It was authored by Assemblyman Lawrence W. "Larry" Stirling and enacted in 1985 by the California State Legislature. In 2012, the Act was comprehensively reorganized and recodified by Assembly Bill 805. As of January 1, 2014, Title 6 (commencing with Section 1350) of Part 4 of Division 2 of the Civil Code is repealed, effectively replaced by newly added Part 5 (commencing with Section 4000) to Division 4 of the Civil Code.
Homeowner Association.
Under Davis-Stirling, a developer of a common interest development is able to create a homeowner association (HOA) to govern the development. As part of creating the HOA, the developer records a document known as the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) against the units or parcels within the HOA with the county recorder.
Even though it is not a governmental entity, the HOA operates like one in some respects. As recognized by the Supreme Court of California, the Declaration of CC&Rs is the constitution of the HOA and is legally binding upon residents to the extent that it does not conflict with state or federal law. CC&Rs, once properly recorded, are presumed valid until proven otherwise. The California Courts of Appeal have explained the quasi-governmental nature of the HOA:
The HOA's board may enact rules which are legally binding upon residents as long as they do not conflict with the CC&Rs or state or federal law. Board meetings, like the boards of government agencies, are generally open to HOA members, with some exceptions. As with government agencies, courts generally defer to the broad discretion HOAs enjoy in discharging their duties.
The HOA is also allowed to charge regular fees to homeowners within the development (comparable to taxes). These are used for functions like paying for security guards (including, for gated communities, the operation of a gatehouse) and maintaining common areas like corridors, walkways, parking, landscaping, swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts, and so on. The HOA can levy fines or sue homeowners for damages and/or injunctive relief to enforce the HOA's rules and CC&Rs.
Background.
The underlying justification for Davis-Stirling is that after the enactment of California Proposition 13 (1978), it became extremely difficult for both state and local government entities in California to raise taxes. With public services rapidly deteriorating by the mid-1980s, and with crime rates soaring throughout California, developers wanted to be able to ensure quality of life in new common interest developments. The obvious problem was that property tax revenue from newly built and sold homes (taxable at market value at time of sale under Proposition 13) might be diverted by cash-strapped governments to pay for providing services elsewhere (that is, for the benefit of homes whose time of sale was long ago and whose taxes could not be raised under Proposition 13). For large planned communities, other possible solutions included forming Mello-Roos community facilities districts or incorporating new cities altogether, but those solutions were neither practical nor cost-effective for small projects consisting of just a few houses or apartment buildings on land already under the jurisdiction of an existing city. Furthermore, developers by the 1980s now had experience with how early suburbs had evolved over the decades (with some residents engaging in activities that decreased neighborhood property values) and wanted to ensure that common interest developments would maintain a common look and lifestyle. Finally, although the state had enacted a Condominium Act in 1963, that act only applied to condominiums. By the mid-1980s, it was now clear that homeowners' associations might be suitable for other types of common interest developments.
Davis-Stirling establishes a unified statutory framework that regulates HOAs for all types of common interest developments. The HOA has the power to impose fees that are cycled back into the community for the community's benefit, and to enforce rules that maintain the "atmosphere" of the community.

Tim Weigel

John Timothy Weigel (March 4, 1945 – June 17, 2001), known professionally as Tim Weigel, was a Chicago broadcaster who spent most of his career as a television sports anchor and reporter.
Early life and education.
Weigel grew up in Gurnee, Illinois, north of Chicago. His father was John Weigel, a broadcast announcer who did voiceovers for national commercials and who founded Weigel Broadcasting. His mother, Virginia Ahn, had been a big-band singer with Tommy Dorsey.
Weigel later moved with his family to Lake Forest, Illinois, where he graduated from Lake Forest High School. He finished third in his class and then attended Yale University, where he played football and was the roommate of future movie critic Gene Siskel. He graduated from Yale with a bachelor's degree in history, and after two years of working, returned home to the Chicago area to earn a master's degree in film from Northwestern University in 1970.
Professional career.
Weigel spent the first two years out of Yale working as an inner-city schoolteacher in New Haven, Connecticut. After completing his graduate degree at Northwestern, Weigel returned to New Haven to work as a waiter. While waiting tables, however, he ran into Yale's president, Kingman Brewster, Jr., who knew Weigel and then helped him to get a job as a reporter at the New Haven Register.
In 1971, Weigel returned to Chicago as a college football writer for the Chicago Daily News. In 1975, Weigel began filing reports for WMAQ-AM and several months later became a sports anchor for WMAQ-TV. In 1977, Weigel joined WLS-TV in Chicago. During his long tenure at the ABC affiliate, Weigel became known for his packaged bloopers which he dubbed "Weigel Wieners" and also for his colorful attire. For a brief time at WLS-TV (1981-1983), Weigel was a news anchor, but he largely was the station's lead sports anchor during his tenure at the station, which lasted from 1977 until December 1994, when he was fired to make way for Mark Giangreco.
In February 1995, Weigel joined WBBM-TV as its lead sports anchor/sports director. He also began writing a sports column for the Chicago Sun-Times.
In 1999, Tim Weigel was inducted into the American Football Association's Semi Pro Football Hall of Fame.
Illness and death.
In June 2000, Weigel began experiencing vision problems. An MRI revealed a brain tumor, and he underwent immediate surgery. After his operation and subsequent radiation treatments, Weigel returned to work. However, six months later, an MRI showed a recurrent tumor.
Weigel died exactly one year to the day after his operation, at his home in Evanston, Illinois.
Personal.
Weigel married his high school sweetheart, Kathy Worthington, in 1966. They had two children, Rafer Weigel, who became an actor, sportswriter and sports anchor, and Jenniffer Weigel, who became a Chicago television reporter. Weigel and Worthington divorced in 1975. He later married Carol Phifer, and that marriage also ended in divorce.
In 1992, Weigel married morning radio personality Vicki Truax. They had one daughter, Teddi, in 1994.

Beaver Hills (Saskatchewan)

Beaver Hills are a range of hills located in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city of Yorkton, Saskatchewan is located approximately 35 miles southwest of the hills.
The Whitesand River, a tributary of the Assiniboine River originates in the Beaver Hills. The two rivers join near Kamsack, Saskatchewan. Large areas of native grasslands and shrubs can still be found in the Beaver Hills region, and along the Whitesand River. The hills are well-adapted for stock raising.
Early settlement included a colony of three or four hundred Dakotans at Sheho, Saskatchewan which soon dwindled to a few because of disappointment in the non-arrival of a promised railroad. In 1897 the first Galacian colony in Canada, consisting of 511 families, was established at Beaver Hills. In 1903 telephone service was extended to Beaver Hills. The towns of Ituna, Saskatchewan and Kelliher, Saskatchewan are located in the Beaver Hills.
A large boulder with a carved face petroglyph was found on December 25, 1905 by Charles Noddings from the Beaver Hills area, and was the stimulus for the creation of the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in 1906.
Bernard Leo Korchinski, Liberal member for the riding of Redberry from 1948-1952 and 1956-1960, was born in Beaver Hills in 1905.

Dell also claimed it is the "world's thinnest laptop", at 0.65 inches thick. It is a slim luxury ultraportable intended to compete with Apple's MacBook Air, Lenovo's ThinkPad X301, or HP's Voodoo Envy 133 laptop.
On September 9, 2009, Dell previewed a new, thinner Adamo "XPS" laptop design, which was 9.99 mm (0.39 inches) thick. 
Adamo 13.
The Adamo 13 was released on March 17, 2009, in the US with either a Core 2 Duo 1.2 GHz ULV processor, 2 GB DDR3 RAM (Admire model) or a Core 2 Duo 1.4GHz ULV processor with 4 GB DDR3 RAM (Desire model). Both were initially equipped with a 128 GB SSD, and a 13.4-inch widescreen with a 1366x768 resolution with a built-in 1.3 MP webcam and microphone. It weighs 4 pounds, originally shipped with Windows Vista 64-bit Home Premium, with an optional external DVD-RW drive. Later on in the year, Dell upgraded the Desire model with a Core 2 Duo 2.1 SL9600 processor and a 256 GB SSD. Adamo prices were also dropped by $500 at the time. The Adamo 13 was offered in two colors; Pearl (silver with white accents) and Onyx (black with black accents).
Adamo XPS.
On September 9, 2009, Dell previewed a new, thinner Adamo XPS laptop design, which was 9.99 mm (0.39 inches) thick. It was released on November 5, 2009 and priced at USD 1,799. The laptop's bottom half, containing the keyboard, is smaller than the top half of the laptop containing the screen. The screen half is concave, so when shut the keyboard embeds itself into the screen. It is designed, that when open, the bottom of the screen half and the edge of the keyboard, make contact with the surface it is resting on. The Adamo XPS has a heat-sensing strip on the lip of its lid which, when touched, opens the lid. Internally, it has either a 128 GB solid-state drive or a 180 GB hard drive. It uses 4GB of DDR3 memory and a 1.4 GHz Intel ULV (ultra low voltage) processor. The battery can run either 4 or 5 hours, depending on configuration.
In March 2010, Dell discontinued their Adamo XPS line.
During that same month of March 2010, Dell made Adamo XPS available again. 
Subsequently, as of November 2010, the Adamo XPS is no longer available on the Dell website.

Don Davis (gun activist)

Don Davis is the owner of Don's Guns and Galleries, a firearms retailer in Indianapolis, Indiana. Davis claims to be the largest independent gun dealer in the United States, and his store has been called the largest public display of firearms in America.
At one point in time, Davis operated multiple stores in the Indianapolis area. The stores were then open 24 hours a day. One night, one of the stores was robbed and an employee was shot and killed. Soon after the tragic incident, Don closed all except for the Lafayette Road store. While no longer open 24 hours a day, this flagship store has continued to experience shootings and attempted robberies, with the most recent shooting occurring September 17, 2012. A customer visiting the store to utilize its indoor shooting range intentionally shot a store employee twice. The employee immediately returned fire, killing his attacker.
Davis was named in the "top 5 dealers who sell guns to criminals" by the United States Department of Justice, ranked at #4 in the US. He has said that the problem is not with him selling the guns, which requires FBI screening, but with those who purchase them privately reselling them, which he describes as a major loophole in the gun control laws.
Davis was a vocal proponent of the Brady Bill, who went so far as to burn all of his military-style semiautomatic firearms on national television while the bill was being debated in congress. Davis has since discredited the Brady Bill as largely ineffective, because of the wording of the bill, which does not ban guns by type or firing capacity, but rather by specific technical attributes.
Locally, Davis is famous for his late night television commercials. Indianapolis Magazine voted his commercials as worst Indianapolis based commercials in 1984 and 1985. Davis traditionally ends all commercials with his slogan, "I don't want to make any money. I just love to sell guns."
Davis was interviewed by NPR's Michele Norris on "All Things Considered" to discuss the sunset of the Brady Bill. He had previously been interviewed by Paula Zahn on CNN's "Paula Zahn Now".

Squadron, a Columbia Law School graduate, was president of the American Jewish Congress from 1978 to 1984 and from 1980 to 1982, president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Ellenoff was an active member of the American Jewish Committee and served as its president in 1984. He graduated from Harvard Law School. Stanley Plesent, a graduate of Columbia Law school, served as General Counsel to the United States Information Agency during the Kennedy Administration
In the media.
Squadron Ellenoff achieved national notoriety in late 1980s with the Wedtech scandal in which a firm client, defense contractor the Wedtech Corporation and many of its officers, were indicted for securities fraud, racketeering and influence peddling when it was discovered that the company was not in fact minority-owned as it had consistently claimed in order to qualify for no-bid contracts with the Department of Defense under a Small Business Administration program. Squadron Ellenoff attorneys were called as witnesses and named partner Howard Squadron claimed to have only "vague" knowledge of the scheme to conceal Wedtech's true (non-minority) owners. Another attorney admitted being aware of the plan in which the Puerto Rican executive would purchase the shares of the company to then default on the payments, leaving control in the hands of non-minority executives, though senior partners at Squadron Ellenoff claimed to have no knowledge of this plan.
The firm is also known to have advised Rupert Murdoch on his many media acquisitions that would form the empire known as News Corp, including the "New York Post".
Merger.
Upon merging with Hogan & Hartson, a contingent of Squadron Ellenoff's litigation department was faced with a conflict of interest that would have precluded them from representing their clients from within the Hogan & Hartson partnership. Therefore, they joined White & Case. Since that time, the group has departed White & Case for Linklaters.

Anton Gunn

Anton J. Gunn (born March 1, 1973), an American politician, is the former head of the Office of External Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. In January 2014, he stepped down to return to the private sector as a consultant, health care entrepreneur and professional speaker. Gunn is widely recognized for the groundbreaking leadership role he played in the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also known as “Obamacare”. Known for his knowledge of the law and his ardent ability to "breakdown" the provisions of Obamacare to diverse audiences, Gunn has garnered a stellar reputation and the moniker, "Mr. Health Care".
Personal life.
Anton J. Gunn was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1973. He attended Kempsville High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Gunn is a graduate of the University of South Carolina (USC) where he played college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks. He also earned a masters degree from USC's College of Social Work. Gunn's younger brother Cherone L. Gunn was killed on 12 October 2000, in an Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the USS Cole. Gunn attributes the tragedy of the USS Cole bombing with sparking his activism into electoral politics.
He currently resides in Washington, DC with his wife, Tiffany & daughter, Ashley.
Early Years.
After finishing his football career at the University of South Carolina, Gunn worked as a community organizer and a nonprofit executive for twelve years in South Carolina and Washington, D.C. before getting involved in politics. Known for his activism and advocacy, Gunn has been a leader on issues of health, health care reform, education, small businesses, terrorism and college athletics. Los Angeles-based author and activist, Peter Dreier listed Gunn as one of the 50 Young Progressive Activists Who Are Changing America. Gunn also taught community activism in the Women Studies program at the University of South Carolina in 2005. 
Gunn was the political director for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential primary campaign in South Carolina and was the key figure in the campaign operation that launched Obama's run to the Democratic nomination for the 2008 presidential election. Gunn also served as a delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.
On November 4, 2008, Gunn defeated David Herndon by a 54-46 margin to fill a state legislative seat vacated by Bill Cotty. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, serving District 79 which included parts of Richland and Kershaw Counties. Gunn was the first African American to be elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives from District 79.
South Carolina House of Representatives.
Gunn was sworn in as a State Representative on December 12, 2008, becoming the first African American to represent District 79 (Richland & Kershaw counties). In his first year in office, Gunn was one of the most active legislators sponsoring or co-sponsoring 204 pieces of legislation. Gunn engaged on many policy issues with special relevance to South Carolina—he joined the education superintendent in pushing for public "school choice," against some in his own party as well as Republicans who wanted to privatize the whole system. He also signed on to a letter to Obama from young elected officials calling for a climate deal. The American Prospect characterized Gunn's independent leadership style as "A New Southern Strategy" because of his willingness to try and bridge the gap between Republicans and Democrats. His leadership strategy proved successful in the 2010 state budget fight where Gunn managed to get passed an amendment focused on government transparency, a difficult feat even for Republicans.
Gunn served on the Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs committee in the House where his subcommittee assignment was Medical Affairs, Children Affairs and Social Services. Rep. Gunn provided a key leadership role on all health care-related legislation assigned to the committee. He was the author and lead sponsor of legislation creating the General Assembly’s first and only Joint Electronic Health Information Study Committee to examine the feasibility of increasing the use of Health Information Technology and Electronic Personal Health Records in South Carolina.
Gunn announced on August 13, 2010, that he would not seek re-election to his House seat to accept a presidential appointment as Regional Director at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services in the Obama Administration. Gunn stated in an email to his constituents "This is not only a tremendous honor for me personally but a tremendous opportunity for our state. There are dire human service needs in South Carolina and across the Southern Region. As regional director, I will be able to have a greater impact on the quality of life for South Carolina’s seniors, children, disabled and the working poor."
United States Department of Health and Human Services.
On August 13, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Gunn to serve under Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius as Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for Region IV which includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Gunn served as the senior member of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Regional Office in the Southeastern United States.
Gunn represented the Secretary in direct official dealings with State, Local and Tribal government organizations by establishing and maintaining effective working relationships with Governors, Mayors, and other key State, local and Tribal officials. Gunn provided guidance and coordination to the efforts of HHS-Intergovernmental & External Affairs (IEA) staff in dealings with Federal and non-Federal government officials. As Regional Director, Gunn served as a presenter to business and organizations on the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. His presentations often were focused on explaining the provisions of the Affordable Care Act to interested parties. Gunn participated in an Affordable Care Act community forum in Jackson, Mississippi where he explained the law to Mississippians.
On April 4, 2012, Secretary Sebelius appointed Gunn to be the Director of External Affairs in the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As Director of External Affairs, Mr. Gunn served as the senior official in the Obama Administration with responsibility for advising President Barack Obama and Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on engagement strategies to implement the Affordable Care Act. He also developed and maintained relationships with external stakeholders for Secretary Sebelius. Mr. Gunn represented the Secretary in direct official dealings with national, state, and local external organizations.
In this role, Gunn was also a frequent speaker on issues related to the Affordable Care Act. In March 2013, Gunn wrote an opinion editorial for The Grio.com entitled "Black Men: Here's Your Wake-Up Call" to discuss health disparities in the African American community and to encourage black men to improve their health by using the Affordable Care Act to purchase health insurance coverage. Gunn was also featured in a series spotlighting African Americans who are playing an integral part in implementing the historic Affordable Care Act. In the series published by the Black AIDS Institute, Gunn explained his role as the Director of External Affairs, "My job is to find people outside of government who want to help implement the law, and make sure I provide them with the information and the tools necessary to help us make sure the law is effective. My job is to ensure that I build strategic partnerships and alliances with those outside entities so that we can deliver on all of the promises that the Affordable Care Act frames for people."
In June 2013, Gunn was featured in The Hill.com as one of '10 Players to Watch on Obamacare Rollout' because of his role maintaining good relationships between the Obama administration and powerful healthcare interest groups, many of which have become restless as the law’s enactment sees challenges. The Hill.com also featured Gunn in their list of 2013 People to Watch This Fall.

Morindone

Morindone is an anthraquinone compound obtained from various "Morinda" species, especially "M. tinctoria", but also "M. citrifolia". Its principal use is as a dye, but it has also been investigated for anticancer and microbial uses.
Preparation.
Morindone is obtained from the root bark of "M. tinctoria" or related species in two stages. In the first step, small roots of immature plants are boiled in alcohol to obtain morindin, a yellowish substance which can also be used in dyeing. Further heating brings about hydrolysis of two glucose monomers through sublimation, leaving intensely red crystals.
"M. tinctoria" is extensively grown in India for commercial production. Moridin content in the roots peaks in two to three years and drops off considerably after that; some attempts have been made to speed up production using tissue cultures.
Use as a dye.
Morindone requires a mordant, and the color obtained varies depending on the substance used. Aluminum mordants give a red color, while iron and chromium produce duskier shades. The traditional mordant used in Java, jirak bark ("Symplocos fasciculata"), is rich in aluminum salts.
Compared to modern dyestuffs, morindone is not as fast or as stable. Since it can be readily cultivated, however, interest in it remains high. Recent research has examined cell culture as a means of increasing yields.

Joshua L. Liebman

Joshua Loth Liebman (1907-1948) was an American rabbi and best-selling author, best known for the book "Peace of Mind", which spent more than a year at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list.
Born in Hamilton, Ohio, Liebman graduated from the University of Cincinnati when he was 19 years old. He went on to be ordained and also earned a doctorate in Hebrew letters from Hebrew Union College. From 1934 to 1939, Liebman served as rabbi of K.A.M. Temple in Chicago, Illinois. In 1939, Liebman became the rabbi of Temple Israel, a Reform synagogue in Boston, Massachusetts.
A sermon Liebman gave at Temple Israel, titled "The Road to Inner Serenity", was published as a pamphlet by one of his friends, bookstore owner Richard Fuller, who passed it on to publisher Richard L. Simon of Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster then arranged to publish Liebman's self-help book titled "Peace of Mind", issued in 1946, which sought to reconcile religion and psychiatry. Liebman had himself previously undergone psychoanalysis. In "Peace of Mind", Liebman "addressed himself to the individual whose personal grief and anxiety, unassuageable by social betterment alone, required an inner peace that psychology and religion, working together, could provide." "Peace of Mind" became one of the year's best-selling books. Reaching #1 on the "New York Times" nonfiction best-sellers list on October 27, 1946, "Peace of Mind" held the top position on the list for a total of 58 (non-consecutive) weeks, and spent more than three straight years on the list. (In 1949, Roman Catholic Bishop Fulton J. Sheen responded to Liebman's assertions by publishing a book of his own entitled "Peace of Soul".)
While "Peace of Mind" was still on the best-sellers list, Liebman died at age 41 on June 9, 1948. Liebman's death was attributed to a "heart attack" or "heart ailment", with one obituary reporting that he had a heart attack following a severe case of influenza. He is buried in the Temple Israel Cemetery in Wakefield, Massachusetts.

<doc id="20863370" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20863370" title="Challenger Tractor">
Challenger Tractor

The Challenger Tractor was the world's first rubber tracked agriculture tractor, created by Caterpillar Inc. in 1986. The original model was a Challenger 65 featuring the Mobile-Trac System (MTS) consisting of rubber tracks and a suspension system. The MTS combined the flotation and traction of steel tracks with the versatility of rubber tires. The use of tracks gave the machines increased tractive performance compared to traditional four wheel drive tractors equipped with tires. The Challenger 65 began as a 270 gross HP machine used primarily for heavy tillage.
In 1995 Caterpillar introduced the first "row crop" tracked machines with the Challenger 35, 45 and 55. These machines ranged in power from 130 KW PTO to 168 KW and were designed to be used for a variety of tasks the larger machines could not. The Challenger tracked tractor was produced by Caterpillar at their Dekalb, Illinois location until the Challenger name and all of its associated agricultural assets were sold to AGCO.
Since 2002, when the brand was purchased by AGCO, Challenger tractors have been manufactured at the company's Jackson, Minnesota facility. At the time AGCO purchased the Challenger brand most Challenger dealers were also Caterpillar construction equipment dealers. Although AGCO has shifted focus of the Challenger tractor to the agricultural market, the construction market is still an important sector for the tractors as AGCO still manufactures specially configured machines for use with pull-type earth moving equipment.
The Caterpillar Challenger MT875B was the most powerful production tractor available during its span with 430 KW gross engine power. In 2007, the MT875B broke the world record for most land tilled in 24 hours with a custom-made, 14 m disc harrow fabricated by Grégoire Besson. It tilled 644 ha. The tractor consumed 4.42 liters/ha diesel fuel.
The current production of Challenger tractors has expanded to include both tracked and wheeled type tractors. Both types are available in either row-crop or flotation type configurations depending upon the preference of the customer. Since their purchase in 2002, the Challenger brand has used a Caterpillar diesel engine in the majority of their models. However, with the introduction of the D series of each tractor model, AGCO began implementing the use of AGCO POWER branded engines that are Tier 4i/Stage 3B emission compliant by using e3, a Selective Catalytic Reduction system which injects urea in engine's exhaust gas stream to reduce nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emitted to the atmosphere.

1869 college football season

The 1869 college football season was the first season of intercollegiate football in the United States. While played using improvised rules resembling soccer and rugby as much as the modern American sport, it is traditionally considered the inaugural college football season. It consisted of only two total games, both of which occurred between the Rutgers University and Princeton University; The first was played on November 6 at Rutgers' campus, and the second was played on November 13 at Princeton's campus.
The first ever college football national championship awarded (retroactively) was split between the only two participants in 1869, Rutgers and Princeton. Princeton was named the champion by the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation, while college football research historian Parke H. Davis named the two teams co-champions. Various other ratings and retrospectives have rated the teams differently.
The two games were played with rules very different from what is currently understood as American football, and also played under home field rules that differed from each other. However, what developed into a more rugby-style play and eventually into the football known by current fans had its beginnings in 1869.
First intercollegiate football game ever played.
In what some regard as the very first game ever played of intercollegiate football, a contest was held between teams from Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). The 1869 game between Rutgers and Princeton is important in that it is the first documented game of intercollegiate game called football between two American colleges. The Princeton/Rutgers game was undoubtedly different from what we today know as American football, as there was no running with the ball, each team included 25 players, and the ball was perfectly spherical. The first game which included running with the ball, 11-man sides, an oval-shaped ball, and tackling to end a play occurred on June 4, 1875, between Harvard University and Tufts University.
Rutgers won the game by a score of 6–4
Second and final game of 1869.
A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton rules. One of the biggest differences in rules was the awarding of a "free kick" to any player that caught the ball on the fly. This rule seriously affected the speed advantage of Rutgers that had allowed them to win the first contest. Princeton won the second game by a score of 8 to 0.
Aftermath of the 1869 games.
The two schools had originally scheduled to meet three times in 1869, but the third 1869 game never took place, reportedly because of the officials at both programs who complained about more emphasis being put on the contests rather than academics and studying. Other sources claim that it may have been canceled due to disagreement over what set of rules to play under. Due to each team winning one game, the inaugural football "season" ended with Princeton and Rutgers each tied at 1-1, and therefore each received a partial share of the college football national championship awarded (retroactively) for the 1869 season.
Rutgers players from the first ever game were honored fifty years later in a ceremony at their home-coming. The last surviving member of this Rutgers team was George H. Large, who died in 1939. The last surviving member for Princeton was Robert Preston Lane, who died in 1938.

Qi Kang (official)

Qi Kang () (740 – May 29, 804), courtesy name Xiaju (), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong.
Background.
Qi Kang was born in 740, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Ding Prefecture (, in modern Baoding, Hebei). and claimed ancestry from the royal Jiang house of the Spring and Autumn Period state Qi. His grandfather Qi Huan () was a well-known commandery governor during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, although his father Qi Ao () was described to have served in an insignificant position.
In Qi Kang's youth, the Anshi Rebellion swept over the northern parts of the Tang empire, and he took his mother and fled to Kuaiji (), in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), where he spent his time studying. In Kuaiji he met a daughter of the magistrate called Shiling and he married her after courting her for a year. He had two children with her. It was said that he was good at writing, particularly when it came to reports on various matters.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
During the "Dali" era (766-779) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, Zhang Yi the prefect of Shou Prefecture (, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) invited Qi Kang to serve as an assistant. It was said that Qi was capable administratively and literarily, and Zhang respected him.
During Emperor Dezong's reign.
Early in the "Jianzhong" era (780-783) of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Daizong, Zhang Yi became the governor of Jiangxi Circuit (, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), and Qi Kang followed him and continued to serve on his staff. After Zhang later served a stint as chancellor and was made the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Fengxiang Circuit (, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) in 782, he invited Qi to serve on his staff again. It was said that most of the military tactics that Zhang used at the time were suggested by Qi.
In fall 783, when a mutiny at the capital Chang'an forced Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), as Fengtian was a small city, Emperor Dezong considered further heading to Fengxiang. Meanwhile, Zhang, hearing of the mutiny and of Emperor Dezong's considering visiting Fengxiang, began undertaking preparations for the emperor's arrival. Qi Kang and fellow staff member Qi Ying pointed out that one of the military officers, Li Chulin (), was previously a subordinate of the mutiny leader Zhu Ci and would be difficult to control. Zhang thus issued an order that Li report to Long Prefecture (, in modern Baoji). Li, giving excuses, did not report immediately, and Zhang, concentrating on welcoming the emperor, never followed up on whether Li left for Long Prefecture. That night, Li and his associates mutinied and attacked Zhang's headquarters. Zhang and two of his sons climbed over the city walls and tried to flee, but were captured by the mutineers and killed. Qi Kang and Qi Ying both fled to Fengtian, and Emperor Dezong made Qi Kang an imperial censor with the title "Shiyushi" ().
After the rebellions were quashed in 784 and Emperor Dezong returned to Chang'an, the treasury was drained, and a major part of the empire was laid waste. At that time, the official Yuan Xiu (), who was in charge of the state salt and iron monopolies, believed that Qi Kang was capable and recommended him as "Cangbu Langzhong" (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of census (), to be in charge of the salt monopoly in the Yangtze River-Huai River region. Qi was also soon made the deputy director of the supplies, in charge of supplying Chang'an with food from the Yangtze-Huai region. Soon, for minor faults that are lost to history, he was demoted to be the prefect of Chu Prefecture (處州, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang). He later served as the prefect of Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) before becoming the governor (觀察使, "Guanchashi") of Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) was well as the prefect of its capital Tan Prefecture (潭州). He was later recalled to serve as imperial attendant (給事中, "Geishizhong") and then the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the region of the eastern capital Luoyang). He later successively served as "Mishu Jian" (秘書監), the director of the archival bureau (秘書省, "Mishu Sheng") and then the minister of worship (太常卿, "Taichang Qing").
In 800, Qi was made "Zhongshu Sheren" (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng") and given the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). This made him a chancellor, replacing the recently demoted Zheng Yuqing. While serving as chancellor, Qi suggested the abolition of the system where, after the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Lìbu) selected officials to be commissioned, the officials from the legislative bureau and the examination bureau (門下省, "Menxia Sheng") would reexamine the proposed list — reasoning that after the ministry of civil service affairs had carefully selected the officials, it would be a waste of time to reexamine. This suggestion was accepted. Per the customs of the time, as the deputy minister of rites was in charge of the imperial examinations, his relatives and friends would be given a separate imperial examination; under Qi's suggestion, that examination was also abolished. Also per Qi's suggestions, various local officials were also given titles of corresponding central government officials. Emperor Dezong also gave Qi the responsibilities of editing the imperial histories.
It was said that while Qi was well-learned, he did not have long-term plans, but overly paid attention to details such that he became known for pickiness and harshness. In 803, after he became ill and offered to resign, he was made an advisor to Emperor Dezong's crown prince Li Song, and it was said that due to the illness, he was unable to thank Emperor Dezong in person. He died in 804 and was given posthumous honors. He was also given the posthumous name of "Cheng" (成, meaning "successful").

Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6T

The Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6T Twin-Pac is a turboshaft engine designed for helicopters. Manufactured by Pratt & Whitney Canada, its first application was in the Bell 212 and UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter family. The PT6T Twin-Pac consists of two PT6 power turbines driving a common output reduction gearbox, producing up to 2,000 hp at 6,000 rpm. The engine is designated T400 by the U.S. military.
Development.
The U.S. military came very close to not procuring the UH-1N Twin Huey because of the PT6T. The purchase of the aircraft for U.S. military use was opposed by the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee at the time, Mendel Rivers. Rivers took this position because the PT6T was produced in Canada. The Canadian government had not supported U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and had opposed U.S. policies in southeast Asia, as well as accepting U.S. draft dodgers. Rivers was also concerned that procurement of the engines would result in a negative trade deficit situation with Canada. Congress only approved the purchase when it was assured that a U.S. source would be found for the PT6T engines. This source was Pratt & Whitney Engine Services in Bridgeport, West Virginia, which was established in 1971 to assemble and test new T400-WV-402 engines. As a result, the U.S. military ordered 294 Bell 212s under the designation UH-1N, with deliveries commencing in 1970.

At the beginning of the War, two Flank Companies were mobilized to fight alongside the 41st Regiment of Foot. One of these was commanded by Captain John Chisholm. They were present at the battle of Queenston Heights, where they heard the (alleged) last words of Major General Isaac Brock, "Push on the brave York volunteers."
After the War of 1812.
The 2nd Regiment remained in the York Militia until sub-units of it broke off to form the Halton Militia in 1846 and the Peel Militia in 1852. These Militia units were broken into Independent Companies in 1856, and were later formed into the 20th Halton Battalion of Infantry and the 36th Peel Battalion in 1866. These two Regiment would later form The Lorne Scots.
The 2nd Regiment of York Militia is perpetuated in the Canadian Army by the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.

Pumpkintown, South Carolina

Pumpkintown is an unincorporated community in Pickens County, South Carolina, United States on State Highway 8 northwest of Greenville.
Geography.
Pumpkintown is located at (35.002896, -82.6529075). It lies 958 feet (292 m) above sea level.
History.
The first white settler, in 1745, was 30-years old Cornelius Keith, a Scottish Highlander who was born at Loch Lomond and as a child had immigrated to Brunswick County, Virginia, to later move with his wife Juda and a son into this frontier area of the Carolinas. 
The local natives, of Cherokee stock, already had a small village on nearby Uwharrie Mountain. Their chief was named Woolenoy, whence the name of the Oolenoy Valley. From this man Cornelius Keith peacefully acquired, by selling one of his ponies, a piece of land where the village was to grow.
The unique name of the place comes, obviously, from the pumpkins that already grew wild, and in large numbers, in the valley. As locals put it, the name was later chosen by the settlers, while arguing over the issue, by following the quick suggestion "of a half-drunk Irishman". 
To this day, every month of October, the town hosts a Pumpkin Festival, raising money for the maintenance of the Oolenoy Community Building and the Pumpkintown Volunteer Fire Department.
Cornelius Keith went on to live a very long life, dying in 1808.

<doc id="20863617" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20863617" title="The Pastellists">
The Pastellists

The Pastellists was an organization of artists that formed in New York at the end of 1910 for the purpose of exhibiting artwork produced in the medium of pastel. The group helped organize four exhibitions in New York between 1910 and 1914 before disbanding in 1915. Some Pastellist members are credited with the initial idea for the exhibition that later became the 1913 Armory Show, the first major exhibition of European modernism in America.
History.
Many artists worked in pastel but few organizations were promoting or including pastel works in their annual exhibitions. The exhibit at the Rand School, organized by Leon Dabo in 1909 and the Exhibition of Independent Artists, organized by Robert Henri, in 1910, had fostered a desire among artists to present more personal work and exhibit irrespective of the expectations of conservative organizations like the National Academy. That year, Dabo became leader of The Pastellists.
A diary kept by the secretary/treasurer of the Pastellists, artist Elmer Livingston MacRae, records the activities of the young group during their first two exhibitions. The president was Leon Dabo and the Board of Control included Jerome Myers, Everett Shinn, and Juliet Thompson. Mr. Dabo engaged his lawyer and artist friend Henry Wellington Wack to draw up the papers for incorporation, which were agreed upon at a members meeting on February 15, 1911. There are no known records by MacRae or other artists of the member meetings or the later exhibitions. 
The first two exhibitions, were held at the Folsom Galleries and according to the MacRae diaries, met with good reviews and high attendance. "The New York Times" said the second show "surpasses in interest its predecessor, which certainly was sufficiently charming." A "striking and important" work was "L'enfant a l'orange" by Mary Cassatt; "Big Wave Design" by Arthur Bowen Davies had "vigor and free handling, with the addition of a feeling for great rhythms".
The daily newspapers chronicled the activities of the Pastellists and we do know that the third exhibition was held at Powell Art Gallery and artists like Arthur B. Davies, Walt Kuhn, and Edward Adam Kramer had become regular exhibitors. Guests like Gutzon Borglum showing some large figure works and Max Weber with "his cube forms, his weird women, his astonishing color schemes", caused such a stir that one critic wrote that the show was “the best exhibition yet held by the progressive and gifted artists constituting this group.”
The fourth exhibition, held at the National Arts Club, was a sister exhibit to a Contemporary Art Exhibition held in the main galleries at the same time. 
By 1915 the American Art Annual listed the Pastellists as "Inactive." It is notable that several of the members of the Pastellists were the same activist artists that exhibited in the initial, non-juried MacDowell Club shows, again organized by Robert Henri. Many of these more radical artists came together to create the "Association of American Painters and Sculptors", the group that mounted the infamous Armory Show of 1913.
An account states that one evening after a successful day at the second Pastellist exhibition, a few of the artists began to discuss forming a larger organization of artists, that would include not only easel painter but sculptors as well. The new organization was to exist for the express purpose of mounting large scale exhibitions, using the same progressive ideas of the Pastellists and the MacDowell exhibits, creating shows that would rival the more conservative juried exhibitions of the National Academy. Like the American Painters and Sculptors, the Pastellists may not have been in existence very long but the impact they had on the American art scene, reached far into the future.
Pastel.
Pastel is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.

Abortion in Trinidad and Tobago

Abortion in Trinidad and Tobago is illegal except in case of threat to the life or health of the pregnant woman. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion is four years in prison and the punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure is the same. Aiding in the process of finding someone to perform an abortion or other preliminary steps is also illegal and subject to a two-year prison sentence.
In Trinidad and Tobago, there is a widely held perception that the majority of people oppose abortion rights yet this may not be the case according to a 2007 study. The study indicated that about half of the Trinidadian population were in favor of increased legal access to abortion.

1-Testosterone

1-Testosterone (delta1-dihydrotestosterone, 17β-hydroxy-5alpha-androst-1-en-3-one, 1-Testo, 1-T) is an anabolic steroid that differs from testosterone by having a 1,2-double bond instead of 4,5-double bond in its A ring. It was legally sold as a prohormone in the United States until 2005, when it was reclassified as a Schedule III drug.
A 2006 study determined that 1-testosterone has a high androgenic and anabolic potency even without being metabolized, so it can be characterized as a typical anabolic steroid. 1-Testosterone binds highly selective to the androgen receptor (AR) and has a high potency to stimulate AR dependent transactivation. "In vivo", an equimolar dose of 1-testosterone has the same potency to stimulate the growth of the prostate, the seminal vesicles and the androgen sensitive levator ani muscle as the reference AAS testosterone propionate, but unlike it, 1-testosterone also increases liver weight.
Doping with 1-testosterone can be detected in urine samples using gas chromatography.
A prodrug of 1-testosterone is 5α-androst-1-ene-3,17-dione, which may be synthesized from stanolone acetate.

Preliminary reconnaissance

Preliminary (or pre-D-Day) reconnaissance is the reconnaissance that is used prior to the principal events of any major theater of war or landing force projection. The term is not similar to the initial word -reconnaissance-, as "preliminary reconnaissance" only prescribes the reconnaissance that is being conducted "beforehand", and "not during", any deployments, military operations, or movement of troops.
This method of intelligence-gathering generally operates within the highest military intelligence tiers, or level of the intelligence general staff, for intelligence collection management—as it allows the combatant, landing force, and/or task force commanders—to better situate and prepare troops for the best feasible deployment, or landing, to achieve the utmost advantage. Aerial and ground reconnaissance elements are collateral to preliminary reconnaissance since it may require both assets to gain the appropriate preliminary intelligence.
Examples of preliminary reconnaissance is best displayed when the United States Marines of the VAC Amphib Recon Company, during World War II, would reconnoiter the beaches and inland for their landing (task) force commanders, a method consecutively known as amphibious reconnaissance. The vital intelligence would dictate the actions of the commander's tactical battle plan of landing the troops ashore.

The von Stauffenberg's have four children:
Early life.
After his father's assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler failed on 20 July 1944, he was sent to a foster home in Bad Sachsa and given the surname "Meister", as the Nazis viewed the name "von Stauffenberg" unacceptable due to the prominence of Claus von Stauffenberg in the assassination attempt. Franz-Ludwig's mother, two older brothers, and younger sister, Valerie (as well as other relatives) were likewise arrested under Nazi Sippenhaft (blood guilt) laws.
Political career.
In 1994, in connection with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 20 July plot, he demanded that communists, who had fought in the Red Army in the National Committee for a Free Germany should not be honored together with his father. According to Stauffenberg, Communists desired to replace the Nazi Party with another single-party dictatorship. This demand gained many prominent supporters, including then-Federal Defence Minister Volker Rühe.

Josie Arlington

Josie Arlington (1864 – February 14, 1914) was a brothel madam in the Storyville district of New Orleans, Louisiana.
Early life.
Arlington was born Mary Deubler in New Orleans to German parents. Though very attractive and shrewd, Arlington was known to be short-tempered and violent. She began working as a prostitute in 1881, supporting her family on her earnings, and opened a brothel on Customhouse Street in 1895.
Storyville era.
In 1898, when Storyville became established, Arlington moved her operations to a four-story frame mansion 225 North Basin Street. The house, now demolished, can be easily identified by its distinctive onion-domed cupola. Its renovation reportedly cost $5,000.
The establishment, formally named Chateau Lobrano d'Arlington but locally known as The Arlington, was famous for its opulence. As an expensive "$5.00 House" it offered about ten or twelve girls at any time, as well as a live sex 'circus' that could be viewed for an extra fee. Though it had a reputation for depravity, Josie claimed that no virgin was ever defiled or exploited by her business.
The Arlington was damaged in a fire in 1905. The madam and her girls were taken in temporarily by Tom Anderson, a saloon keeper and friend/lover of Arlington's. Anderson's establishment gained the nickname 'The Arlington Annex' as a result. Arlington closed the business in 1909 and retired. Many of her assets were bought by Tom Anderson.
Death and burial.
Arlington died in 1914 and was buried at Metairie Cemetery, in a tomb designed by Albert Weiblen. The famous grave features a bronze female figure which has been said to leave its post at the door of the monument and walk around the other graves. The grave quickly became a tourist attraction, which left Arlington's family mortified. The body was later moved to another location within the same cemetery.
The monument still stands, and deceased members of the Morales family are now held within it. The bronze female figure is thought to symbolize a virginal girl being turned away from the Arlington door, following Arlington's claim in life that no woman's innocence was taken on the grounds of her establishment.
In Popular Culture.
MADAM: A NOVEL OF NEW ORLEANS by Cari Lynn and Kellie Martin (Penguin/Plume, 2014) is based on the story of Mary Deubler's rise to become Madam Josie Arlington.

Benito Romano

Benito Romano (born 1950) is the first Puerto Rican to hold the United States Attorney's post in New York on an interim basis.
Early years.
Romano's parents moved to New York City from Puerto Rico and settled down in the Bronx where he was born and raised. His grandfather, a dairy farmer, immigrated from Palermo, Italy to Puerto Rico and married a local Puerto Rican woman. His family was poor, Romano grew up on Simpson Street in the South Bronx and his father worked in a factory that made cigarette holders.
Romano went to Morris High School (Bronx, New York) where he played in the school's baseball and was good enough to be an All-City second baseman. After graduating from Morris High School Romano went to and graduated from New York University in 1972. In 1976, he graduated from Columbia University Law School earning his Juris Doctor law degree, becoming the first member of his family to go to college. In 1977, he was admitted to the New York Bar.
United States Attorney for the Southern District.
During his seven years in the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District, he was chief of the corruption unit under United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani at the height of the municipal scandals. Romano as chief of the public corruption unit, played a crucial role in the negotiations during which Geoffrey A. Lindenauer, an official in the city's Parking Violations Bureau, was persuaded to testify for the Government. Romano later was named associate United States attorney, the third-ranking position.
Joseph A. Califano, Jr., the former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, hired Romano as director of the New York State Commission on Government Integrity and later recruited Romano to his law firm.
On February 1, 1989, Romano was named the interim replacement for Giuliani as the Federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Romano has endorsed the major insider-trading cases and the emphasis on drug, organized-crime and government-corruption prosecutions that began in Giuliani's term. When the New York Times headline "An Italian Name" was published describing the crime-fighting achievement of Romano, he was quick to clarify that he identifies himself as a Puerto Rican and not as an Italian.
On September 7, 1989, President George W. Bush nominated Otto G. Obermaier, a defense lawyer, as the permanent successor to Giuliani and on September 22, 1989, Obermaier was confirmed by the United States Senate as Giuliani's successor.
Partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP in New York.
Subsequent to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Romano was a partner for 20 years at the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the leader of their white collar defense practice. He is currently a partner in Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer's litigation practice group in New York City, and focuses his practice on white collar defense including SEC, FINRA, regulatory enforcement proceedings, and related complex civil litigation. 
On April 17, 2006, Romano, who is married and the father of five children, was appointed by New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly to serve on the newly created, four-member legal advisory committee to the New York City Police Department.

Fishing industry in the United States

As with other countries, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the coast of the United States gives its fishing industry special fishing rights. It covers 11.4 million square kilometres (4.38 million sq mi). This is the largest zone in the world, exceeding the land area of the United States.
According to the FAO, in 2005 the United States harvested 4,888,621 tonnes of fish from wild fisheries and another 471,958 tonnes from aquaculture. This made the United States the fifth leading producer of fish after China, Peru, India and Indonesia, with 3.8 percent of the world total.
Management.
Historically, fisheries developed in the U.S. as each area was settled. Concern for the sustainability of fishery resources was evident as early as 1871, when Congress wrote that "… the most valuable food fishes of the coast and the lakes of the U.S. are rapidly diminishing in number, to the public injury, and so as materially to affect the interests of trade and commerce..." However, it was not until 1976, with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, that the federal government began actively managing fisheries.
Today, inland fisheries and nearshore marine fisheries are managed by state (or regional or county) fisheries commissions. State jurisdictions usually extend out to sea. Coastal fisheries in the EEZ beyond state jurisdictions are the responsibility of the federal system. The primary institutions of the federal system are eight regional fishery management councils and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), also known as NOAA Fisheries. NMFS works in partnership with industry, universities, and state, local, and tribal agencies to collect data about commercial species. Fisheries observers on fishing vessels, transmit real time data electronically to NMFS.
NMFS works in partnership with the regional fishery management councils to prevent overfishing and restore overfished stocks. Objectives are to reduce fishing intensity, monitor the fisheries, and implement measures to reduce bycatch and protect essential fish habitat. NMFS is establishing marine protected areas and individual fishing quotas, and implementing ecosystem based fishery management.
Wild fisheries.
EEZ.
The U.S. EEZ is the largest in the world, 1.7 times the land area of the US, and includes eight large marine ecosystems:
Nearshore fisheries.
Nearshore fishing areas consist of estuaries and coastal areas that lie within of the shoreline. These are under the control of the relevant coastal state rather than under federal or NMFS control. They vary widely in species diversity and abundance. Many species are highly prized game fish, while others are small forage fish used for bait, animal food, and industrial products. Those of greatest interest include invertebrate species like crabs, shrimps, abalones, clams, oysters and scallops. Many species are of unknown status because it is difficult to assess their condition. There are no firm estimates exist for long term potential yield.
Management is spread out among the coastal states and other local authorities, and a comprehensive treatment of the fisheries has not been attempted. Traditional techniques are usually employed, including size limits, catch limits, method restrictions, and area and time closures.
Coastal fisheries.
The coastal fisheries are the fisheries that lie within of the coast that defines the exclusive economic zone, but outside the distance that defines the nearshore fisheries. Coastal fisheries are under federal control in the form of NMFS, as well as under the control of one of the eight regional fishery management councils
Northeast.
Traditionally the most valued fishery for the northeast region has been groundfish. However, the groundfish, especially haddock, yellowtail flounder and cod have been overfished. Record low spawning biomass levels occurred in 1993–94, though these are now recovering. Dogfish and skate rebounded in the 1970s while groundfish and flounder declined. These fish are an important part of the Georges Bank.
The next most important fishery by value is American lobster and Atlantic sea scallop. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this anadromous fish had recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, blue crabs, and clam fisheries. These fisheries are pretty much fully exploited.
The fisheries in the Northeast Region are governed mostly by Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). An example of successful regulation is the 1994 Amendment 4 to the Sea Scallop FMP. This set out to control scallop fishing effort by not accepting more entrants, by restricting the time vessels could fish each day, and by requiring bigger mesh sizes on dredges. Additional protection for scallops was given closing parts of Georges Bank to groundfish fishing. The scallops recovered.
Southeast.
The Southeast region spans the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and the US Southeast Atlantic. Important species are menhaden, drum, croaker, invertebrates, highly migratory species, reef fish and other nearshore species.
Overfishing of king and Spanish mackerel occurred in the 1980s. Regulations were introduced to restrict the size, amount of catch, fishing locations and bag limits for recreational fishers as well as commercial fishers. Gillnets were banned in waters off Florida. By 2001, the mackerel stocks had bounced back.
Menhaden and stone crabs and the three major species of shrimp (pink, brown and white) are fully exploited. Spiny lobster are overexploited. Better data is needed if stocks are to be assessed accurately.
Alaska.
Alaska provides rich resources. Pacific salmon, shellfish, groundfish, flatfish, Pacific halibut, and herring are underutilized.
The salmon species in Alaska (chinook, coho, pink, sockeye, and chum) generally produce good harvest, though some stocks are declining. Up to 1977, foreign fishing controlled the groundfish fisheries in Alaska (apart from Pacific halibut).
The Aleutian Islands, a series of over 300 rocky islands, stretch over from southwest Alaska to Russia. They are home to the largest fishing port in the U.S., Dutch Harbor. The primary target species is pollock, but crabs, salmon and groundfish are also important. Between 1997 and 2001, groundfish were caught by bottom trawling, a fishing method which destroys the habitat of the groundfish, the ocean floor coral and sponge communities. In 2005, about 80,000 km2 (30,000 sq mi) of seafloor around the Aleutian Islands were permanently closed to destructive fishing gears. In 2008, NOAA fisheries created the Aleutian Islands Habitat Conservation Area (AIHCA), most of which is closed to bottom trawling. At 725,000 km2 (280,000 sq mi), the AIHCA is the largest marine protected area in the USA.
Pacific Coast.
On the Pacific Coast important species are Pacific halibut, Pacific salmon, groundfish, pelagic fishes and nearshore species. The stocks are mostly overfished or fully exploited.
Western Pacific.
The Western Pacific region includes the western and central Pacific, the Hawaiian Islands, and the islands of the Northern Marianas, Guam and American Samoa. These are tropical or subtropical waters. They have large species diversity but, because ocean nutrients are not rich, the sustainable yields is low. Pelagic armorhead is the only overfished stock.
High sea fisheries.
The high seas, or international waters, are the waters outside the jurisdiction of the EEZ of any country. U. S. distant fisheries operate in some of these waters, alongside other nations, beyond the jurisdiction of any nation's coastal fisheries.
Highly migratory species.
The main commercial species in the high seas are the highly migratory species. These fish make long migrations across the high seas and are fished by many nations. Highly migratory fish also cross boundaries without regard for international laws. In particular, they enter the EEZ zones of the U.S., which means they become important species also for U.S. coastal fisheries.
In the Atlantic, overfished species include:
The biomass of swordfish in the North Atlantic has increased, probably due to catch reduction and strong recruitment.
In the Pacific, these transboundary fisheries are also important to other Pacific Rim nations and to U.S. fleets fishing within and beyond the EEZ. The major U.S. catch stock is tuna, though billfish, swordfish and shark are also caught. These stocks account for 99 percent of the Western Pacific region's catch.
Seamounts.
A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach the ocean surface. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise at least 1,000 meters above the seafloor. Seamounts became interesting during the 1960s when it was discovered that they can maintain large stocks of commercially important fishes and invertebrates. From 1968 to about 1990, foreign fleets harvested pelagic armorhead across seamounts in the Hawaiian Ridge. Since 1984, fishing been prohibited there so the stock can recover.
Generally, seamounts are found in the high seas, outside the continental shelves and outside the jurisdiction of any nation's EEZ. However, the U.S. Pacific Coast region has an unusually small continental shelf, while the Western Coast region contains islands with no continental shelf. As a result, there are some seamounts within U.S. jurisdiction.
Inland fisheries.
Fisheries in inland waters of the United States are small compared to marine fisheries. The largest fisheries are the landings from the Great Lakes, worth about $13 million in 2003, with a similar amount from the Mississippi River basin. This is less than one percent of the dollar value of the marine fisheries.
Fishing fleet.
Until the late 19th century, the U.S. fishing fleet used sailing vessels. By the early 20th century, fishing vessels were built as steam boats with steam engines, or as schooners with auxiliary gasoline engines. By the 1930s the fleet was almost completely converted to diesel vessels. Fishing gear became more technical: Alaska purse seiners were in use by 1870, longliners were introduced in 1885; otter trawls were operating in the groundfish and shrimp fisheries by the early 20th century. In the late 1960s, factory ships from other countries started fishing haddock, herring, salmon and halibut on traditional U.S. fishing grounds.
Technological advances have played an important role in the development of U.S. fisheries.
Increases in size and speed allowed vessels to fish in more distant waters. Advances include double trawls, the Puretic power blocks for retrieving seine nets, refrigerated holds, durable synthetic fibres for lines and nets, GPS to navigate and locate fishing grounds, fishfinders for the location of fish, and spotter planes to locate fish schools.
The vessel size and gear types of the U.S. fishing fleet varies geographically and between fisheries. Because of this, management of U.S. fisheries with a single policy is not feasible. Individual fisheries have their own biological, economic, and sociological characteristics which make broad policies impractical. On the other hand, ad hoc regulations for individual fisheries is not practical either.
U.S. fisheries use most fishing gear types. Vessels are often configured so they can change rapidly between two or more gear types, such as lobster pots to bottom trawls to scallop dredges. The main techniques are purse seining and trawling. Some vessels freeze their catch at sea, such as factory trawlers, tuna boats, Alaskan crab pot vessels, and some southeast shrimp trawlers. Vessels usually land their catches near their homeports.
Bycatch mitigation.
Based in Hawaii is a longline fishery for tuna and billfish. New management approaches, including placing fisheries observers on vessels to observe what is happening with protected species such as albatross and leatherback, loggerhead and green sea turtles, is expected to reduce incidental catch.
Overfished stocks.
By 2003, overfishing had occurred on 60 stocks. Another 232 stocks were not overfished. Overfishing had been stopped on 31 stocks, and a gain was made of 13 stocks that had been fully rebuilt. There were 617 other stocks which have limited data or for which criteria for overfishing had not been defined. These stocks mostly have harvests which are not significant, so they are not allocated research funding. Their assessment can be expensive and there is no evidence of overfishing. Rebuilding strategies are operating or are being developed for most stocks which are overfished.
There were 267 major stocks, that is, stocks with at least 200,000 pounds (91,000 kg) in annual landings. Of these, 40 were overfished, 147 were not, and it was not known whether the remaining 80 stocks were overfished. There were 642 minor stocks, of which 20 were overfished, 85 were not, and the remainder had an overfishing status which is unknown or is undefined.
Marine protected areas.
A marine protected area (MPA) is federally defined as: “any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein.”
Fourteen MPAs covering have been federally designated as National Marine Sanctuaries, and are administered by a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
In practice, these MPAs are defined areas where natural and/or cultural resources are given more protection than occurs in the surrounding waters. United States MPAs cover many habitats including the open ocean, coastal areas, intertidal zones, estuaries, and the Great Lakes. They vary in purpose, legal authorities, agencies, management approaches, level of protection, and restrictions on human uses.
Aquaculture.
The value of aquaculture products grew from $45 million in 1974 to about $866 million (393,400 tonnes) in 2003.
Aquaculture, in the United States, includes the farming of hatchery fish and shellfish which are grown to market size in ponds, tanks, cages, or raceways and released into the wild. Aquaculture is also used to support commercial and recreational marine fisheries by enhancing or rebuilding wild stock populations. It also includes the cultivation of ornamental fish for the aquarium trade, as well as plant species used in various pharmaceutical, nutritional, and biotechnology products.
According to the FAO, in 2004 the United States ranked 10th in total aquaculture production, behind China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Japan, Chile, and Norway. The United States imports aquaculture products from these and other countries, and operates an annual seafood trade deficit of over $9 billion.
Shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels), account for two-thirds of marine aquaculture production, followed by salmon (25 percent) and shrimp (10 percent). Production occurs mainly on land, in ponds, and in coastal waters under state jurisdiction. As a result of recent advances in offshore aquaculture technology, commercial finfish and shellfish operations have been established in more exposed, open ocean locations in state waters in New Hampshire, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.
Total U.S. aquaculture production, including aquatic plants, is about $1 billion annually, compared to the total world production of about $70 billion. Only about 20 percent of U.S. aquaculture production is from marine species. NOAA estimates that the annual U.S. domestic aquaculture production of all species could increase from about 0.5 million tons to 1.5 million tons by 2025.
Subsidies.
In a study of federal investment in the fishery sector, most aspects of United States tax, fisheries, and societal policies were examined to see whether they created subsidies for the fishing industry and whether these subsidies had impacts. The gross value of direct U.S. subsidies was about 0.5% of the gross ex-vessel value of commercial landings. There are no major ship construction subsidies, market development or other forms of assistance that often exist in developed and developing fishing industries around the world.
Recreational.
In 2006, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that 30.0 million U.S. anglers, 16 years old and older took 403 million fishing trips, spending $42.0 billion in fishing related expenses. Of these, 25.4 million were freshwater anglers who took 337 million trips and spent $26.3 billion. Saltwater fishing attracted 7.7 million anglers who took 67 million trips and spent $8.9 billion.

Huang Yubin

Huang Yubin (, born February 5, 1958 ) is the head coach of the Men's Artistic Gymnastics Team of China. In 1970, Huang Yubin was selected as a gymnast for the Liaoning province team. Four years later, he made it to the national team. He won a gold on rings in the World Artistic Gymnastics Cup in. It was the first time that a Chinese man won a gold medal in gymnastics.
After the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Huang Yubin retired from gymnastics and studied at the Beijing Sports University, where he could only study for a semester since the national team needed more coaches. He went back to the gym and started his coaching career with the women's team.
In his 20 years of coaching the national team, 15 of his pupils won world championships and Olympic gold medals, thus earning him the tag of the "Gold Medal Coach". He is known for his high standards and has helped many gymnasts win world championships, Fan Di was his first "world champion pupil", while she won the gold medal on uneven bars in the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Before that, many people doubted his ability as a coach.
Having proven himself as a coach par excellence over three years in women's team, he started coaching the men's team. At the very beginning, some of his pupils didn't accept his training methods. They finally understood the coach when they were on the podium. In the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Li Xiaoshuang won the men's all-around gold. From that year, his students better grasped his style of teaching.
He had led the men's team in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where Chinese gymnasts won the men's team golds in both events.

Yulong River

The Yulong River () is a small tributary of the larger Li River in Southeastern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that runs through the major city of Guilin to Yangshuo. The Yulong starts in Northern Yangshuo County near Litang and runs for over through small villages of the Yulong River Valley, including Putao, Litang, Chaolong, Yima and Gaotian town, before emptying into the Li around the town of Ping Le. The Yulong is a shallow river of around maximum depth and an average of across. As it is not located near any industrial areas, it is clean enough for swimming, though some brownish surface foam is visible in eddys, probably the result of phosphate runoff from local villages.
Unlike the busy Li River, it has no motorized boat traffic and relies completely on bamboo rafts to ferry passengers downriver. This has become a popular tourist activity, with passengers beginning their journey at the Yulong Bridge, a 400-year-old stone bridge. As the local government has improved local roads through the Yulong River Valley, biking has also become a popular tourist activity, as there are many quaint villages along the river, some offering bed and breakfast accommodation.
The Yulong is prone to sudden flooding, which is one of the reasons why there are not more places to stay close by. Local people have built breakwaters (weirs) every kilometer or so to allow their animals to cross the river, though many have fallen into disrepair. During the dry season (November–March), it is possible for people to walk across some of these weirs; otherwise it is necessary to hire local people to ferry passengers across for about RMB 10 per person.
The Yulong River Valley is very fertile, and its low-lying terrain is excellent for rice fields. In recent years, farmers have planted more cash crops such as pomelos, tangerines and mandarin oranges, which bring in more income than rice. The valley is still agricultural, with few services or businesses outside of the small villages. The valley is accessible from the main Yangshuo highway through the village of Yi Ma, north at the Yulong Bridge and south at the Gong Nong Bridge. The river is approximately west of Yangshuo town proper.

Tree Fort Angst

Tree Fort Angst (sometimes abbreviated to TFA) was an indie pop band that was originally a solo project of former St. Christopher guitarist Terry Banks.
History.
Banks began working as Tree Fort Angst in 1991, when he released a cassette-only album. This was followed by an EP in 1992 on the German label 'A Turntable Friend', "Six Songs". TFA then expanded to a full band with the addition of John Gotschalk (bass) and Hunter Duke (drums). Although the band only released a handful of further EPs and singles during their time together before splitting up in 1994, their output was collected on two posthumous compilations.
Banks lists among his influences Postcard Records bands Orange Juice and Aztec Camera, The Beatles, The Jam, Everything But The Girl, The Go-Betweens, The Smiths, and The Chills.
Banks later joined Glo-worm and The Saturday People, while Gotschalk joined the Red Hot Lava Men. Duke is now a member of Hotel X.

Jingo-ji

The temple was established in the year 824, as a merger of two private temples founded earlier by Wake no Kiyomaro. They were the Jingan-ji (神願寺) in Kiyomaro's home province and the Takaosan-ji (高雄山寺). 
Jingo-ji holds sixteen National Treasures of Japan. They include the "honzon" and other statues. Another treasure is a list written by Kūkai in 812 called the and displays some of Kukai's talent for calligraphy. This list contains people and deities in 812 who underwent the Abhiseka ritual at Takaosan-ji, presided by Kukai.
Buildings at Jingo-ji have been destroyed by fire and war. Of the original buildings, only the Daishi-dō survived the Ōnin War; even the present Daishi-dō is of uncertain date. Itakura Katsushige, a daimyo and former Kyoto shoshidai in the Tokugawa shogunate, commissioned a major reconstruction in 1623. Another reconstruction took place in the 1930s with a contribution from Gendō Yamaguchi. Present structures include the following:

Bridgeton flood of 1934

The Flood of 1934 was a natural disaster that hit the town of Bridgeton, New Jersey in August 1934. Over the course of three days, heavy rains fell in the region, swelling Sunset Lake and other local interconnected waterways. At the time, there were two earthen dams holding the water back at Sunset Lake and Mary Elmer Lake. Eventually the pressure was too much and the dams gave way sending a torrent of water down the Cohansey River as well as tributaries connected to the Lakes. The wall of water surged down through the banks of the Cohansey, emptying the lakes and the Raceway and flowing into and through downtown Bridgeton, which straddles the river. All the bridges that connected the east and west sides of the town were destroyed. Also damaged was Tumbling Dam Park, where the dam that held the water of Sunset Lake was located.
Aftermath.
In the aftermath of the flood, residents had no way of crossing the Cohansey River from one side of the town to the other. To go around the River meant a detour. The citizens were given short term relief when a Troop of Sea Scouts (associated with the Boy Scouts of America) used a donated lifeboat to set up a temporary ferry service by stringing a rope across the River and pulling the boat back and forth. Later, the United States Army Corps of Engineers came in and set up a temporary pontoon bridge. In the photographs taken at the time, the pontoon bridge appears to be very flimsy. In fact it was very stable, and one could drive a car across it.
Due to the surge of water during the flood, much debris was deposited in the Cohansey River, making navigation of the waterway dangerous. The city hired a hard-hat diver to help in the removal of the debris. This is where Art Mckee, the "Father of Underwater treasure hunting" got his start.
Story.
In the Bridgeton area, among the most remembered of our worst brushes with Mother Nature is undoubtedly the flood of 1934. At the time, showers had been predicted, but no one was prepared for the cloudburst that crippled Bridgeton and racked up more than $1 million in damage. (or over $17,000,000.00 in 2013)
Seven inches of rain fell within a four-hour time span, setting off a chain reaction of disasters. Lightning destroyed the Dividing Creek Town Hall. Thousands of dollars of stock was damaged in Laurel Street stores and two Bridgeton dams were washed away. Four 75-foot oyster schooners, torn from moorings, smashed into the Commerce Street Bridge, tearing it in half. The Broad Street Bridge sank three feet and was condemned. Flood waters battered the Bridgeton Water Works and stopped the pumps. This created a water shortage, causing Owens-Illinois Glass Co., Ritter, Laning, Pritchard, Martin Dye and other plants to shut down. More than 2,500 people were out of work. 
About 60 U.S. Army engineers, called down from Fort Dix, helped build pontoon bridges to relieve the traffic congestion. They were assisted by 150 men taken from the unemployment roles by the Emergency Relief Administration. In the meantime, enterprising youngsters made more than $85 by rowing people across the river at 5 cents a trip. The nickel fare aboard the S.S. Ferry saved thousands of people a 21-mile detour by means of the nearest upstream route.By the late 1930s, a permanent bridge of cantilever construction had been built on Broad Street. It still serves travelers today.

Julien Coupat

Julien Coupat (born June 4, 1974, Bordeaux) is a French political activist at the centre of a controversial investigation. As one of the Tarnac Nine, he was accused of plotting the sabotage of train lines in November 2008, which the French government decided to define as terrorism, and spent over six months in jail before being released on bail.
Biography.
Julien Coupat is the son of a medical doctor and an executive at Sanofi-Aventis. After studying business at the École supérieure des sciences économiques et commerciales (ESSEC), he switched to social sciences at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) but did not complete his doctorate. In 1999, he co-founded a radical philosophy magazine called "Tiqqun" before setting up a commune in 2005 in the village of Tarnac in the Corrèze department where he and his friends ran a farm and an all-purpose store. Coupat and his girlfriend Yildune Lévy came to the attention of the FBI after protesting outside an army recruitment centre in New York City, which was later the target of a bomb attack, having crossed the border from Canada illicitly. The Bureau flagged the pair up to their French counterparts, who began investigating the group.
The TGV sabotage affair.
In the night of 7–8 November 2008, Coupat and Lévy went for a car ride and played cat-and-mouse with police cars following them. Their trip included a 20-minute stop in Dhuisy, in the Seine-et-Marne department, by their account for a sex session in the vehicle. Their car was parked near a train line in one of the locations where iron hooks were left dangling from the overhead lines that night, paralysing the high-speed TGV network.
On November 11, gendarmes raided the Tarnac farm and arrested nine residents in connection with the sabotage. Four of the nine were released on November 15, under conditions. A further three were released on December 2, and the last but one, Lévy, in January 2009. Coupat remained in jail until May 28, 2009, when he was released under bail with instructions to remain in the Paris region and have no contacts with the other 8.
Controversy.
The arrests were publicly greeted by Interior minister Michèle Alliot-Marie who described the suspects as "an anarcho-autonomist cell" and Coupat as its leader. A judge first ordered Coupat's release on December 19, 2008, but the judicial services immediately appealed, using an unusual procedure. Controversy erupted and inflated in the next six months over government spin on the case, Coupat's repeated failure to secure a release on bail despite investigators having no evidence against him, and the nature of the charges against him, when the acts of sabotage were not of a nature to cause bodily harm to anyone. The French police said he was part of the Invisible Committee of the book "The Coming Insurrection".

Close operations

Close operations are operations that are within the commander's area of operation (AO) in his battlespace (see: Area of responsibility). Most operations that are projected in close areas are usually against hostile forces in immediate contact and are often the decisive actions. It requires speed and mobility to rapidly concentrate overwhelming combat power at the critical time and place and exploit success. Dominated by fire support, the combined elements of the ground and air elements conduct maneuver warfare to enhance the effects of their fires and their ability to maneuver. As they maneuver to gain positions of advantage over the enemy, combined arms forces deliver fires to disrupt the enemy’s ability to interfere with that maneuver.
Commanders prioritize fires to weight the main effort and to focus combat power to achieve effects that lead to a decision. The effects of fires can be massed to strike the enemy at the decisive point and time, while reducing the risks to the force entailed in massing maneuver forces at a single point or in a single portion of the battlespace.

Arthur William Hill

Sir Arthur William Hill FLS FRS (11 October 1875 Watford - 3 November 1941), was Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and a noted botanist and taxonomist.
The only son of Daniel Hill, he attended Marlborough College where his interest in natural history was encouraged by the classical master and entomologist, Edward Meyrick. Hill went on to King's College, Cambridge, where he came under the influence of Marshall Ward and Walter Gardiner, acquiring an MA and DSc.
His numerous field trips started with the expedition of the English geographer, William Bisiker FRGS, to Iceland in 1900. This was followed by exploration of the Andes in Bolivia and Peru in 1903, sparking an interest in cushion plants which was to last throughout his life, and the Caribbean in 1911.
In 1907 he joined Kew as Assistant Director under Sir David Prain, and started contributing to the floras of Africa and India. In 1922 he succeeded Prain as Director. With grants from the Empire Marketing Board, Hill was able to send botanists all over the world, himself visiting Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Rhodesia, East Africa, India, Cyrenaica and the West Indies. His interests were not confined to taxonomy, but extended to economic botany, of which he was an enthusiastic proponent, and all the other activities of Kew. He managed a large number of changes in the Gardens, despite having to operate in the post-war austerity climate. Some of his greatest successes were in building, renovating, and extending glasshouses, being responsible for the new Rhododendron House in 1925-26, an improved Economic House in 1930 and the South African Succulent House in 1936. 
He was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of New Zealand during his 1928 visit, returning to London to lecture the Linnaean Society in 1929 on natural hybrids in New Zealand. He published a joint paper with Brian Laurence Burtt in 1935 on the cushion plant genera "Gaultheria" and "Pernettya" (now include in "Gaultheria") from alpine habitats in Asia, North and South America, and Australasia. 
Hill never married and died on 3 November 1941 in a riding accident.

"Troma's War, also known as 1,000 Ways to Die" in the United States, is a 1988 action/adventure film written by Lloyd Kaufman and Mitchell Dana and directed by Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman (credited as Samuel Weil). It began production in 1986 and was released in theaters in 1988 shortly after "Class of Nuke 'Em High" was done making its rounds at the box office.
Plot synopsis.
After a commercial airline crashes on an uncharted island, the surviving passengers venture to the other end of the island, which they find is home to a terrorist infiltration camp. When Parker, a mentally unstable Nam vet, manages to kill one of the terrorists, he and Taylor lead the other passengers to a safe haven where they can stay until things have cleared up. After being captured, said passengers are forced to watch a neo-Nazi brutally murder an air steward and a priest. Gathering what weapons they can find, the remaining passengers storm the camp in hopes of recovering their lost friends. Meanwhile, back at the camp, a musician's girlfriend is shot and killed by an obese terrorist wielding an AK-47 assault rifle. After losing a fight with the Nazi, the rocker's bandmate is kidnapped by another terrorist leader named Señor Sida (Mr. AIDS in Spanish), who leads a cult known as the AIDS brigade who hope to infiltrate AIDS to the US as a part of the terrorists' plan. Sida proceeds to violently rape the captive woman. Meanwhile, an attractive young African American lady is taken to see the brains behind the terrorist operation, a pair of Siamese twins conjoined at the head. Parker and Taylor lead the remaining passengers in a surprise attack on the terrorists' hideout. Señor Sida, while trying to escape, is shot in the scrotum with a crossbow by the young lady he raped. Having been transformed by her experience, the African American lady hunts down the Siamese twins armed with a machete. After finding them, she violently hacks them apart. She then goes after a terrorist who tried to have his way with her and stuffs a grenade in his mouth. After having realized the terrorists' plan to invade America, the remaining survivors lock and load, forming a small platoon that plan to invade the terrorists' main headquarters the next morning. Later that night, Taylor and his love interest Lydia share an intimate moment with one another. Our heroes plan to storm the camp later the next morning. The men refuse to let the women go with them so they don't put their lives at risk. Hardwick, a depressed widower, volunteers to drive a truck full of explosives into a cargo boat hauling the terrorists into the US. After alerting the terrorists, Hardwick is shot down, ruining their plan. At the last minute, the females ride in and help kill off the terrorists. A morbidly obese passenger named Cooney decides to fill Hardwick's role. He fights his way through the terrorists blocking his way until he gets to the truck. Just as the boat is taking off, Cooney drives the truck off a ramp into the boat, destroying it. The unlikely heroes mourn the loss of Cooney, until he appears unharmed, having ditched the truck as a last minute resort.
Production.
After finding success in such films as "The Toxic Avenger" and "Class of Nuke 'Em High", Troma began production on what was intended as a criticism of President Ronald Reagan's attempt to glamorize armed conflict. The film was initially rejected by the MPAA as too violent to even receive an R rating, so several scenes were cut from to the film, including the entire AIDS subplot. Despite this the film was rejected a second time leading to even heavier cuts. The butchered end result of the film was poorly received. In the aftermath of the film's poor financial performance, Troma experienced financial hardship, jettisoning the company from the Hollywood mainstream. Troma's War's budget was $3,000,000, making it Tromas most expensive film to date.

Roberts studied at Columbia University, where he received his B.A. in 1961, at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned an M.A. in 1963, and at Stanford University. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1968 and joined the Stanford faculty at that time. At Stanford, he was Director of the Institute for Communication Research (1985–1990 and 1999–2001), and chair of the Department of Communication (1990–1996). He retired in 2006.
Much of Roberts' research concerns the effects of media on youth. A notable study coauthored by Roberts and Ulla Foehr for the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, at the turn of the millennium, U.S. children spent the equivalent amount of time to a full-time job watching television and other media, and a later follow-on study by Roberts and others coined the name “Generation M” for the youth of the day after discovering that they were packing even more media into their schedules by multitasking.
Roberts also studied depictions of drug use and violence in media, and took part in 1997 U.S. Senate hearings on violent music lyrics. Roberts' research provided the foundation for the content rating systems of the Recreational Software Advisory Council, of which he was a board member, and its successor organization the Internet Content Rating Association.

Terrestrial reconnaissance

Terrestrial reconnaissance, or "ground" recon, is a type of reconnaissance that is employed along the elements of ground warfare. It is the collection of intelligence that strictly involves routes, areas, zones (terrain-oriented); and the enemy (force-oriented). Ground reconnaissance is considered to be the most effective type of reconnaissance but also the slowest method in obtaining information about the terrain and enemy.
Those units in contact with the enemy, especially patrols, are among the most reliable sources of information. Combat engineers are also good sources of information. These engineer units often conduct engineer reconnaissance of an area and can provide detailed reporting on lines of communications; i.e., roads, rivers, railroad lines, bridges, and obstacles to maneuver.

Tarpon Inn

The Tarpon Inn is a historic hotel located in Port Aransas, Texas, United States that originally opened in 1886. The building was named after the tarpon sport fish that drew many anglers to the sea side city and Port Aransas was called "Tarpon" at the time. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 1979.
The original Tarpon Inn was built in 1886 from surplus material that came from an old Civil War barracks. The building was destroyed by fire in 1900. Two new buildings were constructed in its place only to be ravaged by a hurricane in 1919 and its 12-15 foot storm surge. The larger building was completely destroyed, but the smaller building was reparable and continued to be used as a hotel until 1926. 
In 1923, James M. Ellis bought the property. In 1925, he built the structure that still stands today. He retained the barracks style as a homage to the original 1886 Tarpon Inn. To strengthen the building against future hurricanes, dozens of pine poles were sunk into 16 to 20 feet of concrete. The long poles extend up through the attic and the roof is anchored to these poles. When the new building opened, the old smaller building became the hotel's dining room.
After World War II, tarpon began to disappear from this section of the Texas coast. With the decline of the tarpon and the sportsmen who came to fish for them, the Inn fell into disrepair and changed hands several times. The Inn was repaired and reopened by a new owner in 1975 and has again become a popular place for fishermen as well as tourists and business travelers.
The main lobby of the Tarpon Inn is adorned with over 7000 tarpon scales, each signed by the angler who landed the fish. The most famous scale is the one signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who fished off the Texas Coast in 1937, even though he did not actually stay at the Inn. Notable guests at the Inn include Aimee Semple McPherson, Jesse Jones, Douglas Corrigan, and Clyde Beatty. Duncan Hines spent his honeymoon at the Inn.

Don't Look Any Further

"Don't Look Any Further" is a 1984 single by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards, featuring Siedah Garrett. The single was written by Franne Golde, Dennis Lambert, and Duane Hitchings. It peaked at #2 on the Billboard Black Singles chart and peaked at #72 on the Billboard Hot 100.
M People version.
"Don't Look Any Further" is the eighth single from British band M People. It was the third single from their second album "Elegant Slumming" (1993). The song is a cover version. Produced by M People. It was released on 22 November 1993. The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart.
Composition.
Heather sings the lead of the duet the song which was originally sung by Dennis Edwards and Mark Bell sings the female part (originally sung by Siedah Garrett). Heather slightly alters the third line of the first verse: "What you need is a lover, someone to take over. Oh babe, don’t look any further." instead of singing: "What you need is lover, a man to take over. Oh girl, don’t look any further."
The M People version stayed very faithful to the original, incorporating the much sampled baseline, with a trademark deeper moog sound, programmed drumming sticking to the same familiar base drum beat. However, instead of the guitar in the middle eight, they used a saxophone in its place and just one set of keys with progressive and chords plays throughout with splices of percussive drumming at junctions between verses and choruses.
Finally, the backing vocals were provided by critically acclaimed British R&B Gospel Group Nu Colours.
Chart performance.
Don't Look Any Further received very positive reception from critics. The single became the fourth consecutive top 10 hit for the band and their third consecutive Top 10 from the "Elegant Slumming" album. It charted and peaked at number 9, spending five weeks in the Top 20 with weekly sales starting at 82,000 copies and it continued to sell over 60,000 copies in each of the following four weeks as it moved from 9 to 11 to 12 to 14 to 19. In its sixth week there was a minor a surge in sales to climb two places to 17 to 27 to 44 to 52 to 70.
The Dennis Edwards original only charted as high as number 45 in the UK.
The song spent a total of 10 weeks on the chart, leaving in early February 1994, so "Don't Look Any Further" had the second longest chart sojourn of any M People single, after the 11 weeks of both predecessor singles. Elsewhere, they secured their second consecutive Top 5 hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number 4 and stayed in the chart for 18 weeks. In Switzerland it took the single seven weeks to peak at number 23, but stayed in the Swiss Top 40 for 18 weeks in total.
Airplay.
With the two airplay successes of "Moving on Up" and "One Night in Heaven", radio was quick to follow on their popularity after the single was serviced to radio at the end of October 1993. It entered the chart at number 68 to and steadily climbed to 41 to 21 to 12 the week before release and then it climbed to 6 and then peaked at 4 where it stayed for one week before falling to 5 in it seventh week on the chart. It then fell one place for the following three weeks which meant it was a firm Christmas airplay single as well. It stayed on the airplay chart for a total of 14 weeks and left in mid-February 1994 whilst "Renaissance", the next single, was already making steady progress up the chart in the other direction.
Music video.
The video was filmed over two days in Germany’s capital city of Berlin on 26 and 27 October 1993 while the band was still promoting "Moving On Up"’s success around Europe. Great landmarks including the Brandenburg Gate, The Berlin Wall, Berliner Dom, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and the Fernsehturm (the TV Tower in Alexanderplatz) are all featured within the video adding to atmospheric backdrop seen in a misty haze.
As only the second M People music video to be filmed abroad, the external shots show Heather walking around the cold city centre as is also Mark Bell who is never seen singing with Heather but they seem to pass each other at various points without realising while walking around town. Mike, Paul and Shovell are also seen chatting to each other under bridges, whilst Heather seems oblivious to their existence.
Other internal shots show both Heather and Mark leaning up against separate opposing walls and later are seen in a split-screen effect singing their duet but, again, never directly to each other. During the final chorus, Heather is seated in a quiet German pub alone on a table at the fore and in the background Mike, Paul and Shovell are seated around another table and they join in to sing the chorus. In this final scene, the camera continues to pan horizontally from right to left and back repeatedly as the four main members of the band all sing together.
Live performances.
During both legs of the Elegant Slumming tours, Mark Bell would continue to duet the song with Heather. But on subsequent tours, the male lead would change: on the Bizarre Fruit Tours, Heather would duet with backing vocalist Paul Johnson. On the Fresco Tour she’d sing with the late Lynden David Hall, who was also supporting them and Nate James would duet on the 2005 Re-union Tour, as he was supporting them. Other duets have been sung with backing vocalist Tommy Blaize after 2007.
Remixes.
The two mixes were provided by British House Music Producer (Dancing) Danny D (aka D Mob) who gave a funkier interpretation with additional backing vocals on the chorus whereas, the similar sounding "Strip to the Bone" mix (also by Danny D) gave the song a funkier version with an additional rap ad-lib of "the drum, the bass" to bridge the verse and chorus.
Artwork.
One of the four sofas as seen on the "Elegant Slumming" album cover is featured on the cover of this single on its own. It is this particular pink sofa that Heather was sat on on the cover of the parent album and her not being there incorporates the idea of "look(ing) no further" and finding no one there, in total contrast to the previous single Moving On Up when it was just a side profile of Heather that made up the artwork.
Other use in sampling.
In 1988, British, blue-eyed, soul group, The Kane Gang, took their version to number fifty-two on the UK singles chart, and number sixty-four on the Hot 100. The Kane Gang's rendition of "Don't Look Any Further", was number one on the dance charts for one week, and was their sole entry on the chart.
The first well-known sample of the song's distinctive bass-line is Eric B. & Rakim's 1987 single "Paid in Full."
2Pac's song "Hit Em Up," from his 1998 compilation album "Greatest Hits", also sampled "Don't Look Any Further."
The "Don't Look Any Further Remix" of the song "Unpretty" by R&B girl group TLC heavily samples the song.
The Notorious B.I.G. and Junior Mafia also sampled "Don't Look Any Further" for their song "Gettin' Money (Remix)."
Australian Hip Hop group The Herd also sampled the bass line on their song
"77%".
Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock also sampled the bass-line in their song "Make It Hot"
Lil Wayne sampled "Don't Look Any Further" on his 2002 single "Way of Life". It featured Big Tymers and TQ and it was released from his album "500 Degreez".
Houston rapper Z-Ro sampled the song in "Mo City Don (Freestyle)" off his album "Let the Truth Be Told".
Rapper Snoop Dogg sampled the song in "New Jackson" (De Sean Jackson Theme Song) & in the song "Paper'd Up".
In popular culture.
"Don't Look Any Further" played a prominent role in the plot of "The X-Files" episode "Orison," as a high school memory trigger/divine warning for Dana Scully.
The instrumental also been used as an underscore in several first season episodes of "Everybody Hates Chris"
It also appears in episode 4 of HBO's "How to Make It in America".

Syren (novel)

Syren is the fifth book in the child fantasy "Septimus Heap" series by Angie Sage. It was released on September 29, 2009 by HarperCollins and Bloomsbury Publishing. She went on a book promotion tour for "Syren" as well as a contest to promote it further.
The story continues from the previous release "Queste" and deals with Septimus going to pick up his friends from a distant land. While coming back they are trapped in an island and there they learn of an evil plan to destroy their homeland, The Castle. The rest of the story deals with how Septimus and his friends save their home and destroy the evil coming their way.
Development.
Angie Sage had compared book five to Robinson Crusoe with "tentacles— lots of them". Commenting on the book, she says:
I've planned the ending, and I'm already just drawing everything in, so with number seven, I can pretty much think what's going to happen. But on the other hand, there's always the unknown. I write in the character's shoes, so I'm never entirely sure what they're going to do.
Synopsis.
The story picks up where "Queste" ended. Jenna, Nicko, Snorri, Ullr and Beetle are in the harbor known as the Trading Post, where Jenna encounters her father, Milo Banda, who persuades them to spend the night on his ship. Back in The Castle, Septimus gets a promotion to Senior Apprentice by Marcia Overstrand, for being the only apprentice wizard to complete the Queste. This enables him to head off on an adventure of his own. His escapade begins as he plans a simple flight on board his dragon, Spit Fyre, to retrieve his friends from the Trading Post. 
Around this time, Aunt Zelda sends Wolf Boy from the Marram Marshes. She is giving him a challenging test for becoming the first male Keeper. As soon as Wolf Boy leaves, Zelda retrieves a SafeCharm, which appears to be a tiny, pear-shaped gold bottle. She needs to deliver it to Septimus, however, by the time she arrives he has already left. Due to an unfortunate mix-up, the SafeCharm falls into the hands of Merrin Meredith who stole it believing it to be a rare perfume. When he takes the top off to sniff it, a jinnie comes out of it. "Jim Knee" as he is called by Merrin, sets off on his own adventure. Meanwhile, Wolf Boy bumps into Simon Heap in the Port; he was looking for his fiancee Lucy Gringe who had been missing. Wolf Boy approaches the House of the Port Witch Coven. There he reads Zelda's letter which tells him to feed a creature called Grim and cut-off its tentacle tip. The Port Witch takes him inside her kitchen and wakes the Grim, which is a giant octopus. The witches bring forth a captive Lucy to feed to the Grim. Under the pretense of feeding Lucy to the Grim, Wolf Boy and Lucy escape from the coven. They are chased by a senior witch, Linda, but they escape by riding straight into a leaving ship.
While flying towards the Trading Post, Septimus sees a bunch of seven islands on the sea and hears a voice calling him. Ignoring the voice, Septimus continues his journey and reaches Milo's ship "The Cerys". There Milo shows Jenna a big trunk which is full of tiny lead tubes and which he declares to be brought specially for Jenna's safety. Jenna, getting tired of Milo's hospitality decides to leave the ship and fly off home with Septimus and Beetle on Spit Fyre. But while flying home, they get caught in a raging storm. They try to find the Cattrokk Light, a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, and fall onto a nearby island when Spit Fyre's tail gets struck by lightning. Septimus tries his best to cure the tail with "Physik" but his attempts fail. He is also perplexed by a voice calling his name continuously. One day Septimus sees a girl approaching him. The girl introduces herself as Syrah Syara; Septimus remembers meeting her when he went back in time 500 years, during the events from "Physik". She fled from The Castle during the "Queste" and hid on the island. Syrah heals Spit Fyre's tail and reveals that she is under a terrible enchantment by the resident evil ghost of the island known as Syren. The Syren, a singing ghost who attracts sailors by her voice and leads them to their doom by possessing them, stays in a tower atop the hills of the island. Syrah takes Septimus there to show him an opened ice-tunnel latch beneath the island; she mentions that danger is approaching the Castle. Before Septimus can close the ice-tunnel, the Syren takes hold of Syrah while Septimus flees.
Meanwhile Marcia goes to the Manuscriptorium vaults and finds that the ice tunnel latches, which pass from The Castle to the Seven Isles of Syren, through Cattrokk Light to the House of Foryx, are opened. Suspecting that the evil ghost Tertius Fume may be behind this, she returns to the Wizard Tower to find Zelda who informs Marcia about Septimus' danger. Together they find the jinnie and lock him in a sealed chamber in the Wizard Tower and devises a plan to help Septimus. Lucy and Wolf Boy continue their journey aboard the ship whose captain is a pirate. They reach Cattrokk light and there, the pirate's henchmen throw the lighthouse guard overboard. Lucy and Wolf Boy hide from them in one of the rooms of the Lighthouse. Surprisingly, they find that the lighthouse guard, Miarr, who is half-cat half-human, is still alive because cats have nine lives. The ship's captain and his henchmen take the light from the lighthouse and transport it to the island where Jenna and Beetle reside, and they see them coming. Miarr then leads Lucy and Wolf Boy to an underwater machine which allows them to approach the island unseen.
"The Cerys" travels towards The Castle under Nicko's steering. However, near Cattrokk Light, Nicko hears the Syren's song and believing mistakenly that the light on the island is coming from the lighthouse, he sails the ship onto the rocks. The pirate ship's captain and his henchmen then ambush Cerys' passengers, but Septimus and the others are able to lock them in the hold and save them all on board. The captain and his henchmen open the trunk, which contains thousands of bottles of jinnie and release them. To their horror, Septimus and the others find that the jinnie warriors come on board and address Tertius Fume as their master; he is on the island directing them towards the Syren tower ice tunnel. Meanwhile under Marcia's order, Septimus' jinnie finds him. Septimus and Beetle come to the conclusion that since Jim Knee was in a golden bottle, he has the power to overcome the warrior jinnie because gold is purer than lead. Septimus orders Jim Knee to go and freeze one of the warriors so that all the others will be simultaneously frozen. The front line of warriors had already reached through the ice-tunnel to the Wizard Tower, where just as they are about to kill Marcia under Fume's supervision, Jim Knee freezes the last jinnie; hence freezing all the other jinnie warriors. Marcia triumphs and informs a surprised Fume that she will see to it that his ghost is eradicated forever. Septimus and the others rejoice and Lucy and Wolf Boy help Miarr to put back the light atop Cattrokk. Septimus also orders Jim Knee to go and capture the Syren and force it into a small sealed bottle; hence Syrah is saved from her terrible enchantment. However, learning that more than 500 years have been passed since she arrived there and that Julius Pike is long dead, Syrah enters a magical coma because of the combined effects of her recent dis-enchantment and the stress and sadness of this news. The whole company returns to The Castle, where Marcia, Sarah and Silas Heap and Aunt Zelda meet them.
Reception.
Critical reception for the book was mostly positive, with Nannette Morges from the "Wilton Villager" commended the maturity of the characters.

<doc id="20864046" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20864046" title="René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet">
René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet

René-Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet (1943 - 22 December 2008) was a French aristocrat, money manager, and businessman. He was one of the founders of Access International Advisors (AIA Group), a company caught and subsumed in the Madoff investment scandal in 2008.
He was born in Saint-Malo, France.
The AIA Group was a research analyst investment agency that specialized in managing hedged and structured investment portfolios that involve commercial physical and biological research.
On 22 December 2008, Magon de La Villehuchet reportedly committed suicide. He was found dead in his company office on Madison Avenue in New York City the following morning. His left wrist was slit and he had taken sleeping pills. Although no suicide note was found at the scene, his brother in France received a note shortly after his death in which he expressed remorse and a feeling of responsibility. AIA Group had lost $1.5 billion, including Villehuchet's own personal fortune. After Madoff's Ponzi scheme imploded, Villehuchet held out some hope he'd be able to recover some of his money, and opted to take his own life when it was apparent that it was irretrievably lost.
Magon de La Villehuchet lived in New Rochelle, New York, and came from a prominent French family. Before founding AIA Group, he was the chairman and CEO of Crédit Lyonnais Securities USA. He also contributed to the founding of Apollo Management, financial management firm established by financier Leon Black. He was also a member of New York Yacht Club, the Larchmont Yacht Club—a racer in the Star and Shields sailboat classes—and the St. Malo Bay Nautical Club in France. He left behind a wife.
AIA had connections to wealthy and powerful aristocrats from Europe. Magon de La Villehuchet ‘s family had done business with many of these aristocrats and their ancestors for almost 300 years. Its funds enlisted intermediaries with links to the cream of Europe's high society to garner clients. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) do not believe Magon de La Villehuchet was involved personally in the US$50 billion fraudulent financial Ponzi scheme which Madoff was arrested for masterminding, on 11 December. Bloomberg News reported on 2 January 2009 that the AIA funds had increased aggregate exposure to Madoff from 30% to 75% of a total US$3 billion assets in 2008, for a US$2.25 billion exposure. It also identified Philippe Junot, former husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco, and Prince Michael of Yugoslavia as partner and investor-relations executive, respectively, in the firm; and Liliane Bettencourt, the world's wealthiest woman, the 86-year-old daughter of L’Oréal founder Eugène Schueller, as an early investor.
According to "The New York Times", René-Thierry's older brother Bertrand said that Thierry was connected to Madoff by Thierry's partner in AIA, Patrick Littaye, another French banker, and that Thierry had not known Madoff personally. “He had a true concept of capitalism,” Bertrand Magon de La Villehuchet, 74, said of his brother, quoted in the "Times". “He felt responsible and he felt guilty. Today, in the financial world, there is no responsibility; no one wants to shoulder the blame.” Bloomberg reported that Bernard had invested 20% of his assets in an AIA/Madoff fund. It also reported that René-Thierry founded Access in 1994 with Littaye. The two had met at Paribas in 1970. In February 2009, Littaye denied having heard of whistleblower Harry Markopolos' accusations against Madoff in the years before the scandal broke, and said Madoff was "of course" exempted from the usual handwriting analysis (graphology) which was among the due diligence efforts AIA made with its outside fund managers.
Over the final 20 years of his life, Magon de La Villehuchet was renovating and organizing the archives of Le Château de Plouër in Plouër-sur-Rance, Brittany, which he'd inherited from an uncle, and was nearly finished with the endeavor at the time of his death.

Fremantle Harbour

Fremantle Harbour is Western Australia's largest and busiest general cargo port and an important historical site. The inner harbour handles a large volume of sea containers, vehicle imports and livestock exports, cruise shipping and naval visits, and operates 24 hours a day.
Fremantle consiste of the Inner Harbour which is situated on the mouth of the Swan River, the Outer Harbour, 20 km south at Kwinana in Cockburn Sound which handles bulk cargo ports, grain, petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas, alumina, mineral sands, fertilisers, sulphur and other bulk commodities and Gage Roads which is the anchorage between Rottnest Island and the mainland. The Inner Harbour includes northern and southern wharves named North Quay and Victoria Quay respectively. All of this area is managed by Fremantle Ports, a government trading enterprise.
History.
Fremantle's port role began immediately the Swan River Colony was founded in 1829, but the entrance to the Swan River estuary was blocked by a rocky bar, which made the mouth of the river virtually impassable for seagoing vessels.
The first steamship to enter the port was H.M.S. Driver on 4 December 1845.
Fremantle shipping was served by the Long Jetty that extended into the open sea, where Bather's Beach is today. Cargo was offloaded onto the jetty and then taken down Cliff Street in Fremantle's West End. It was loaded onto barges that sailed up the river on the westerly sea breeze and back to Fremantle on easterly winds. Later it was transported by rail. Sailors disliked the Long Jetty: in 1892 Captain D.B. Shaw of the Saranac described it as "terrible":
"... entered and fought against putting the vessel alongside jetty to discharge. It is a terrible place. No place to put a vessel. No shelter whatever. All the ships have to lay and discharge at the wharf or pay lighterage... It is blowing a gale from the SW ... and takes all our time to hold her... She had done considerable damage to herself... It is certainly the worst place I or anyone else ever saw. No place to send a ship of this size... Any man who would come or send a ship a second time is a damned ass."
Other alternatives.
British marine engineer Sir John Coode advised Sir John Forrest an outer harbour near Rous Head, or one that would stretch south from Arthur's Head, could be built. Coode ruled out building a port in the river mouth as he believed it would continually silt up due to lateral sand drift.
In 1887 the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce pushed hard for the southern scheme to be chosen, but the Colony could not raise the half-million pounds which were estimated what such an initiative would cost.
By 1891 Forrest was examining another proposal: an offshore facility at Owen Anchorage south of Fremantle.
But by then Charles Yelverton O'Connor had been appointed the Colony's Engineer-in-Chief, and decided the best option was an inner harbour built in the mouth of the Swan River.
The discovery of gold in Western Australia meant a working port was urgently needed, Parliament finally accepted O'Connor's plan after much political haggling, the capital was raised in London and preliminary work commenced late in 1892.
Harbour development.
The first stage of the harbour works began with a ceremony in which the Governor's wife, Lady Robinson, tilted the first truck load of rubble for the North Mole.
Blasting and dredging the rocky bar created a channel, dredging deepened the river basin, and two moles were built to protect the harbour entrance. Land was reclaimed so quays and warehouses could be built. The inner harbour was opened on 4 May 1897 when the steamer "Sultan" drawing just one foot of water with Lady Forrest at the wheel was the first ship to enter the partly built port.
"While the harbour has been deepened, and facilities extended and modernised over the years, the basic structure of the Inner Harbour remains essentially unchanged to this day, testament to the boldness, brilliance and foresight of its designer."
There are two lighthouses on either side of the entrance to the harbour, the green coloured South Mole Lighthouse, in operation since 1903, and the red painted North Mole Lighthouse, which commenced operation in 1906, located at the end of the westernmost point of the harbour.

As the port neared completion, Forrest lobbied the British to have Fremantle as the port of call for the Mail Packets. Victoria and New South Wales fought for the retention of Albany as the Mail Packet port, as they were fearful they would lose business. Forrest threatened Western Australia may stay out of the proposed federation of Australian colonies unless they agreed.
On 3 August 1900, Forrest won when the Postmaster-General in London informed the Post Master-General in Perth that Fremantle would be substituted for Albany as the port of call for Mail Packets.
Ten days later the Orient Company's RMS Ormuz, homeward bound from Sydney to London, was the first British mail carrier to enter and berth in Fremantle harbour. In 1901 Fremantle surpassed Albany for the first time in total tonnage of ships and the following year in the number of ships when it cleared 410 ships (1,045,170 tons) to Albany's 248 ships (540,910 tons).
Rail link.
The railway from the harbour was constructed in the 1880s, and continued to be developed with railway workshops (later moved to Midland Junction), railway sheds, railway marshalling yards, locomotive depots, and in 1907 Fremantle railway station was opened.
Wartime role.
During World War II, the harbour accommodated scores of Allied naval vessels on active service. Battleships, troop transports, hospital ships and support vessels, including many passenger ships, were seconded into the war effort.
Visitors to Fremantle during the conflict were passenger liners and converted troop carriers RMS Queen Elizabeth and RMS Queen Mary. Because of their size neither was able to take up an inner harbour berth, and instead anchored in Gage Roads. Other well-known ships to visit included the RMS "Strathaird", RMS "Strathnaver", RMS "Orion" and RMS "Otranto".
In 1940 boom defences were installed in the harbour as a security measure and anti-aircraft installations were built.
After the fall of Singapore in March 1942, many ships sought refuge at Fremantle: at times 30 were at anchor in Gage Roads.
"In the inner harbour, it was ... a common sight to see up to as many as four vessels of substantial size lying in tier, and it was due solely to the circumstances forced upon the port and the prevailing weather conditions that such a state of affairs could be permitted. Altogether, some 75 vessels were using the inner and outer harbours at one and the same time, and in the fortnight ending 20th March, a total of 103 vessels, Naval and merchant, and mainly seeking refuge, arrived at the port. Until these vessels could be ordered to some other destination, acute conditions persisted at the port for some weeks."
Fremantle Submarine Base was the largest submarine base in the southern hemisphere during World War II. The first United States submarines arrived at Fremantle in 1942, the US Navy built a submarine repair facility on North Quay the next year, and until 1945 the port accommodated more than 170 submarines from the U.S., British and Dutch navies. The slipway on the south side of the entrance to the harbour where the new Maritime Museum is now located was also an important part of the wartime role of the harbour.
Victoria Quay.
A statue honouring C. Y. O'Connor was erected on Victoria Quay on 23 June 1911. It now stands near the entrance to the Fremantle Ports administration building on Cliff Street.
During a waterside clash between police and workers on Bloody Sunday, 4 May 1919, lumper Tom Edwards was struck on the head with a police baton. He died three days later, leaving a wife and three children. A memorial fountain by Pietro Porcelli was erected in Edwards' memory that year, and was moved to Fremantle's Kings Square in 1968.
The Fremantle Passenger Terminal was constructed in time for the Empire (Commonwealth) Games in 1962.
North Quay.
North Quay is the portion of Fremantle Harbour on the northern banks of the Swan River, built in the 1890s this area is primarily container utilised for Container shipping. On the western edges is Rous Head a smaller harbour used for vessel maintenance which also includes the Rottnest Island Ferry Terminal
Signalling Equipment.
In 1928 the Signal Station at Fremantle was moved from Arthur Head to a site on Cantonment Hill. This building was replaced in 1956 by a new structure, whose functions were superseded in 1964 by the opening of a signal station on the new Port Authority administration building, which was opened by Premier David Brand on 5 March.
South Mole.
Built in the 1890s from the southern point of the Swan river mouth is a breakwater to ensure a safe anchorage for vessels in the Inner Harbour. A light house was added in 1903 initially shining a white it conflicted with the Woodman point light house, leading to the South Mole light to change to a green beacon.
North Mole.
Built in 1890's the North Mole was extended almost immediately after completion and on a number of occasions since, the most recent being in the late 1980s, to allow for the addition of an entrance into the Rous Head harbour that was being constructed. Situated on the western end of the mole is a light house initially this shone with green light but was changed to red after it became necessary to alter the white light on the south mole to green.

Keith Brubaker

Keith M. Brubaker was a member of the United States Coast Guard who lost his life in service to his country in 1967.
Biography.
Coast Guardsman - Engineman Third Class (EN3) Keith Michael Brubaker, 22, of Warren, Michigan, born March 24, 1945 lost his life on July 11, 1967 while in service to his country when he fell overboard a Coast Guard boat in Grand Marais, Minnesota and drowned.
He is only the second Coast Guard member in Minnesota or on Lake Superior to be killed in service to his country, the other being Edgar Culbertson in Duluth, Minnesota. Brubaker and his newlywed had just moved to Grand Marais, Minnesota after being transferred to Station North Superior earlier that year. The Brubakers were expecting their first child in just a few months. Previously, Brubaker had served on board the USCGC Bramble (WLB-392) and Devils Island Light Station since joining the service in 1964.
At approximately 1900 hours on July 11, Brubaker got into the station small boat and started out through the Grand Marais harbor. His wife recalled that he had seen some logs blocking the channel – a common occurrence, and decided to try to clear this obstruction. As he neared the break wall, alone in the boat, the boat was sent straight up into the air after it presumably struck one of these logs. Brubaker was thrown from the small boat and struck his head on either the boat or a log as he fell into the water. He was knocked unconscious and drowned. A friend of his had witnessed this from a nearby pier and swam out to try to save Brubaker but was unable to find him below the surface.
A Grand Marais resident looked out his window and noticed the Coast Guard boat circling uncontrollably without anyone in the craft and called the Cook County Sheriff's Office, who responded. The boat was stopped by rescuers and the local sheriff dive team went to work right away searching for Brubaker, he was found the next morning. Keith Brubaker was laid to rest in Troy, Michigan with full military honors. His daughter was born two months later.
Engineman Third Class had been awarded the National Defense Service Medal and Distinguished Marksmanship Ribbon.

United States Marine Corps Light Armored Reconnaissance

The United States Marine Corps Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalions, or LAR Battalions, are fast and mobilized armored terrestrial reconnaissance units that conduct reconnaissance-in-force (RIF) ahead of the battalion landing teams or division infantry forces. They mainly provide the Marine Air-Ground Task Force and the Marine Expeditionary Unit commanders vital intelligence of the enemy.
They perform their methods as special motorized, infantry-based reconnaissance units as they are equipped with LAV-25s to quickly penetrate enemy lines and locate and/or harass any enemy forces to determine their size, strengths, location, and any other pertinent information requested of the Marine commanders.
History.
The LAR Battalions were formed from the remnants of the Scout (Tank) companies in Marine tank battalions that existed during World War II. The early tank scouts would reconnoiter ahead of enemy forces and conduct reconnaissance-in-force while riding on top of the tanks. They became reliable as they were able to be projected into enemy territory, harass the enemy, and withdraw back to friendly lines, reporting their newfound intelligence. By the time World War II ended, the scout companies formed into scout and snipers platoons and Division Reconnaissance companies. 
In the early 1980s, the Light Armored Battalions were created to fill in the necessary assets to the infantry regiments. Prior to the formation of LAR Battalions assigned to the Fleet Marine Force (FMF), there was one combat-ready LAV-25 equipped unit within the Marine Corps. In 1983, the First Light Armored Vehicle Battalion (1stLAVB), was created at Marine Corps Air and Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palms, California. 
LAR Battalions are tasked with screening for RCTs or BLTs and are not to get decisively engaged. However during OIF many elements of LAR Battalions were the lead element in the push to Baghdad..

Mary Hyde

Mary Lord nee Hyde (1779–1864) in the period 1855 to 1859 sued the Commissioners of the City of Sydney and won compensation for the sum of over £15,600 (plus costs) for the inundation of her property at Botany.
Hyde is noted for her pertinacity. Despite in late 1855 partially winning her case through the New South Wales courts, Mary appealed and three years later in early 1859 won fully after taking her case as far as the Privy Council in England, the final court of appeal then available to a British subject living in the Colony of New South Wales.
In 1859, in the 70-year-old Colony of New South Wales, her court case, although largely ignored by historians, was nevertheless an achievement: women did not have the vote; and Hyde lived in a male-dominated society governed by British law where women had little power. Married women had no power at all,"A Letter to the Queen on Lord Chancellor Cranworth's Marriage and Divorce Bill"1. a married woman has no legal existence whether or not she is living with her husband;2. her property is his property;3. she cannot make a will, the law gives what she has to her husband despite her wishes or his behavior;4. she may not keep her earnings;5. he may sue for restitution of conjugal rights and thus force her, as if a slave to return to his home;6. she is not allowed to defend herself in divorce;7. she cannot divorce him since the House of Lords in effect will not grant a divorce to her;8. she cannot sue for libel;9. she cannot sign a lease or transact business;10. she cannot claim support from her husband, his only obligation is to make sure she doesn't land in the parish poorhouse if he has means;11. she cannot bind her husband to any agreement.In short, as her husband, he has the right to all that is hers; as his wife she has no right to anything that is his.Property Rights of Women in Nineteenth-Century England</ref> and Mary was only able to sue as being a widow she was no longer married.
Having experienced life as a woman in Victorian society, single, married and widowed, Mary became concerned with what today would be called a feminist issue. She stipulated in her will that any bequests made to her daughters and granddaughters were to be given to them in their own right and that their husbands should not have any say. She attempted to give her daughters and granddaughters control over their own inheritances. The law of the day overrode her stated wishes. Remembering that colonies in Australia were largely governed by English law, prior to the English 1887 Married Woman's Property Act (which was a rallying point for many first-wave feminists in the late nineteenth century, and was only passed after years of intense political lobbying by dedicated women) a married woman could own no property, and was the chattel of her husband. Any property that she had owned as a single woman, or that she inherited as a married woman whether in goods, money, or land, passed into the ownership of her husband.
Life.
Hyde was born in Halesowen, Worcestershire, England in 1779, the eldest child of Edward Hyde and Sarah Blunn. Mary also had a younger brother John who was born two years later.
After being transported to Sydney as a teenage convict, Mary became the unmarried partner of Captain John Black (1778–1802) the privateer (state-sanctioned pirate), whaler, ship's captain, navigator and master mariner who named King Island; and later the wife of Simeon Lord (1771–1840) a wealthy entrepreneurial emancipist merchant and magistrate.
Convict.
In November 1795, at the age of 16, Mary was accused of stealing items of clothing from Francis Deakin, her employer, including 1 black silk cloak, 1 muslin shawl, 1 cotton gown, 1 dimity petticoat, 2 pair of cotton stockings and 1 pair of scissors. On 21 March 1796, at the age of 17, Mary, who also used her mother’s name as an alias, was sentenced at the Warwickshire Assizes to seven years' transportation to New South Wales for theft. She was not transported until 1798.
On 18 July 1798 Mary arrived in Sydney, one of 95 female convicts on board the "Britannia II", a whaling ship that had also previously brought convicts to Sydney in May 1797. Females were in short supply in the colony, and competition for the newly arrived female convicts on that day was described by David Collins in "An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales" as like a cattle auction. The lot of the women who arrived that day was to be a servant or a “wife” to a stranger, or a hut-keeper for convict males at Parramatta for those who would not go with one man. As Mary stayed in Sydney, it can only be assumed that she was initially chosen by one of the men in the “cattle auction” on board the deck of the "Britannia II".
Relationship with John Black.
In August 1798, when they were both 19 years old, Mary met John Black, a ship's officer who had survived the mutiny on the "Lady Shore" in 1797, and who that month had arrived in Sydney on board the "Indispensible". Mary came under John’s “protection” and fell pregnant almost immediately, and they went on to have two children. Mary, however, was often "keeping the home fires burning" as John was away for months at a time either whaling or otherwise working his trade as a ship's captain. The longest time that Mary got to spend with Black was from 11 January 1801 to 1 January 1802, when he entered into the liquor trade and established a shop on his leased land.
On 31 May 1799, Mary's gave birth at home to her first child, John Henry Black (1799–1867). Home since March had been on land leased from the government by John Black, near what is now De Mestre Place in Sydney, on the eastern side of George Street, between Hunter Street and Martin Place. Three days after the birth Black again sailed, and Mary was left to care for her newborn alone until he next returned. John Black's business saw him sailing in and out of the port of Sydney, and their child was not baptised until he was three months old.
In 1800 it was recorded that "‘’Mary Hide"(sic) "and her son were off the’’" (government) "‘’stores’’". This was because Mary "living on the lease of Mr. Black; and owing 7 sheep, 4 pigs and 3 goats" had been able to meet a level of self-sufficiency, something the government greatly encouraged in an effort to cut costs.
On 7 September 1801, Governor Philip Gidley King granted Mary Hyde an Absolute Pardon, eighteen months before her sentence would have expired.
Back in January 1801, when John Black had returned to Sydney from one of his long voyages, Mary Hyde became pregnant with their second child. Mary Ann Black was born at home on 1 October 1801.
On 1 January 1802, after being home for nearly 12 months, Black sailed for Bombay (now Mumbai) and then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in the "Fly". Mary was left at home as the sole parent of two children under the age of three, and one only 3 months old. Then in about May 1802, on the return voyage from Kolkata, John Black's ship was lost at sea with all hands. News did not reach Sydney until 12 months later, in May 1803, that Black's ship was missing, but Black's death was not confirmed until April 1804. Mary was not left completely destitute when Black sailed in January 1802. She had the house and shop on the land leased in Black's name, and what remained of the money and supplies that Black had left behind before he had sailed.
Relationship with Simeon Lord.
About 1805 Hyde began a new relationship with a business associate of her late partner. He was the former convict, and one of early Sydney's great characters, businessman Simeon Lord, who in addition to becoming a magistrate also happened to be one of the most litigious men in the colony. Simeon Lord knew both Mary and her previous partner through trading dealings involving Black’s ships whose goods had been stored in his warehouse. Simeon Lord became step-father to Mary's two children. Simeon also brought into the relationship a nearly teenage adopted daughter, the orphan of two convicts who had died before she was 4 years old. In 1806 Lord's adopted daughter married one of his business partners when she was no more than 14 years old. Also in 1806 Mary's first child to Lord was born. Mary and Simeon went on to have 8 children of their own over the next 15 years. With investments in Lord's name, they also became one of the richest couples in the Colony of New South Wales, with only six Sydney residents having greater landholdings.
In 1807 Mary sent her daughter, Mary Ann, to England with Simeon Lord's adopted daughter Joanna and her husband Francis Williams, to be placed into the care of the child's grandfather, Reverend John Black. In February 1807 the then five-year-old left on board Lord's ship the "Commerce", but the ship returned to Sydney in April 1807 after picking up shipwrecked men, and sustaining damage in a storm. In July 1807 her daughter was baptised at St Philip's Church, Sydney. Then in November 1807 her daughter began the voyage to England for a second time aboard another of Lord's ships, the "Sydney Cove". Young Mary Ann Black did not return to Australia until 1814 after her grandfather's death.
Mary Hyde married her partner Simeon Lord on 27 October 1814 at St Philip's Church, Sydney. Their fifth child was only one week old. A witness to the wedding was William Charles Wentworth, the son of magistrate and family friend D'arcy Wentworth.
In the 1820s the family moved from their ‘city’ home in Macquarie Place, Sydney, to their ‘country’ home in Botany, nearer to the site of their factory.
Widow.
When her husband Simeon Lord died in 1840, Mary had a mourning brooch made containing her husband's woven hair in a gold setting with a border of half-pearls. Simeon, the legal holder of the couple's wealth, had died an “immensely wealthy man”. Under the terms of the will, Mary, a woman, was made executor of the estate. Lord's estate was divided between his wife and 8 children, the youngest of who was 18. Mary became one of the wealthiest women in the colony. Hyde then lived about another 24 years as a widow, and continued to reside in the family home until her death.
After her husband's death, in addition to managing large livestock and landholdings, Mary continued the manufacturing business in the factory at Botany. She employed many local people in the milling and dressing of cloth, and in the making of hats, stockings, leather, shoes, candles and harnesses, until the business had to be closed due to the flooding of part of her Botany property and the loss of the stream which drove the mill.
Beginning in 1855, in litigation worthy of her late husband, Mary sued the Commissioners of the City of Sydney. In July 1855, by notification in the "Government Gazette" of Colonial Act of the 17 Vic, No. 33, entitled "An Act for supplying the City of Sydney, and portions of the Suburbs thereof, with Water", approximately were resumed for a reserve for a water supply for Sydney. The land resumed including land owned by Mary on which stood her woollen mill. Compensation was offered, but the amount offered was disputed as unreasonable. Under the Colonial Act, questions of disputed compensation are tried in the form of an action brought against the Commissioners. In order to gain reasonable compensation for this resumption the then 76-year-old Mary took the Commissioners of the City of Sydney to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. ""For thirty one and a half acres, with a mill, a dwelling-house, some outbuildings, and water privileges, Mrs. Mary Lord claimed £30,000."" In December 1855, in the third and last action taken by residents whose land had been resumed, she partially won her case.
The two cases that were heard before Mary's case, and which had established Mary's right to compensation for the deprivation of her land, buildings, and enough water to provide the motive power to run her mill, were "Darvall V. The City Commissioners" that was heard by Mr. Justice Dickinson in October 1855, and "Edward Lord V. The City Commissioners" that was heard by Mr. Justice Dickinson in November 1855. For the loss of and buildings the jury returned a verdict for Darvall of damages of £3200; and contingent damages of £800 in the event of the plaintiff establishing at law his claim to the use of water. Mr. Justice Dickinson ruled that plaintiff, having no mill that was deprived of its motive power, was not entitled to damages to the use of the water, but that this could only be decided by a decision by the full court, on appeal. For the loss of and buildings and the motive power of water to his mill, the jury returned a verdict for Edward Lord of damages for £11,000; and contingent damages of £4,000 for the loss of water for other purposes than those of his mill, namely, for possible wool washing, and other purposes. Mr. Justice Dickinson ruled that the use of the water for possible wool washing was incompatible with the terms of the original land grant, but that this could only be decided by a decision by the full court, on appeal.
Held over two days, Mary's case included the special jury of twelve travelling from the court house to Botany to view the land that had been resumed. Unquestioned was Mary's right to compensation for the deprivation of her land, buildings, and enough water to provide the motive power to run her mill. The jury assessed the damages for these at £11,460. What was still in question was her right for damages for the deprivation of water for other purposes like the use of her machinery. The jury, under instructions from the judge Mr. Justice Dickinson, assessed contingent damages for the loss of additional water usage at another £7,200 - but only if Mary had been entitled to the undisturbed use of the water that, previous to the resumption by the Commissioners of the City of Sydney, had been flowing from the land further upstream owned by her son Edward Lord. As in the previous cases, whether Mary had been entitled to the undisturbed use of the water was something that Mr. Justice Dickinson ruled could only be decided by a decision by the full court, on appeal.
The amount of damages of £11,460 awarded to Hyde were reduced after further action by the Commissioners. They did not question the amount of damages on the land and buildings that had been awarded against them, but they did question the amount of damages on the water for the motive power for the mill. The Supreme Court directed a new trial unless Mary agreed to reduce the amount of the damages that she had been awarded, to which she consented. The fight was not yet over, however, as there was still the issue of the contingent damages of £7,200 to which she believed she was entitled.
Showing her pertinacity, Mary appealed her case to the Privy Council in England, the final court of appeal then available to a British subject living in the Colony of New South Wales. The judgment of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the appeal of "Mary Lord v. Commissioners for the City of Sydney" was delivered on 12 February 1859, after Mary had turned 80 years of age. News of the verdict took over two months to reach Australia, but Mary had been awarded the final £7,200 and her costs. Lord Kingsdown (Judge of the Admiralty Court), Lord Justice Knight Bruce, Sir Edward Ryan, and Sir John Taylor Coleridge had decided, despite contrary arguments from the defendants, that Mary had been entitled to the undisturbed use of the water on her land that had been resumed, and that she was entitled to the extra £7,200 compensation. Her total compensation as a result of the court actions was now over £15,600.
Historical research would need to be done to establish if Mary has an even more important place in Australian history. Due to the prohibitive circumstances under which Australian women were living legally and socially, and that for anyone living in Australia prior to or during the Victorian era it was expensive and geographically difficult to appeal a case in England, Mary is perhaps the first, and possibly only, female and/or female convict, to have taken a legal case from New South Wales to the Privy Council.
Death.
Hyde died on 1 December 1864 at the age of 85 in the family home of "Banks House" (named after Sir Joseph Banks) at Botany. She was the matriarch of a large, notable, Australian family, and had already settled large amounts of her estate on her children before she died. Probate of her remaining estate was granted on 24 August 1865 and was valued at £11,000. In her will she named all her ten children, although some had predeceased her. Mary was also specifically concerned for her daughters and granddaughters. She stipulated that any bequests made to her daughters and granddaughters were to be given to them in their own right and that their husbands should not have any say. She attempted to give her daughters and granddaughters control over their own inheritances. The law of the day overrode her stated wishes. Remembering that colonies in Australia were largely governed by English law, prior to the English 1887 Married Woman's Property Act a married woman could own no property, and was the chattel of her husband. Any property that she had owned as a single woman, or that she inherited as a married woman whether in goods, money, or land, passed into the ownership of her husband.
Hyde's sons became well-known in public life. One of them, George William Lord (1818–1880), a pastoralist, was elected to the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1856, and transferred to the legislative council in 1877. He was colonial treasurer in the third Martin ministry from December 1870 to May 1872. Her eldest son to Simeon Lord, Simeon Lord Jnr. (1810–1892), was a pastoralist in Tasmania and Queensland. Another son, Francis Lord (1812–1897), was a member of parliament for many years, and a third son, Edward Lord (1814–1884), became city treasurer at Sydney and mayor of St Leonards. Her eldest son John Henry Black (1799–1867) later became the first manager of the Bank of New South Wales. One of her sons-in-law was another successful merchant in Sydney, Prosper de Mestre (1789–1844) who married her daughter Mary Ann Black (1801–1861).
An ambrotype photographic portrait of Mary Hyde (Mrs Simeon Lord), in its case, and taken sometime in the period 1845–1860, is in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.

Pob Pee Fa (2009 TV series)

Pob Pee Fa (; ) is an upcoming Thai Period Horror lakorn, remake from 1997 hit lakorn of the same name with the role of pee fah or Jao Nang Luang on Torn played by awarding winning actress Chiranan Manochaem (จีระนันท์ มะโนแจ่ม). Other scheduled cast members include Thana Suttikamul (ธนา สุทธิกมล) and Thai-British model/actress Buntitha Puwijarn Cowell (บัณฑิตา ภูวิจารณ์ เคาวเวลล์).
Plot.
Pob Pee Fa is the story of princess who is turned into an ogress (Pee Fah) after eating the past generations of Pee fah nectar that caused by unrequited love. She starts hunting for raw intestines and fresh blood, which revolved for several generations with her love enemies.
The real identity of Pee Fah is Phi Pop (ผีปอบ), a ghost of popular Thai folklore.
Incidents during filming.
Several of Pob Pee Fa's actors have been involved with incidents during filming. An unexplained fire broke out in one of the vans. The actors Ah’Dao Duangdao Jarujinda (ดวงดาว จารุจินดา), Ae Pornthip and Chiranan Manochaem were all hospitalized. A cameraman was hit with a stray bullet during the filming of a sword fighting scene.
Chiranan Manochaem.
After finishing two episode of the lakorn, Chiranan Manochaem, an award winning actress from Nang Tard is interviewed during the opening ceremony which was held on October 7, 2008. According to Siam Dara Newspaper, Yui Jiranan said: ""I’ve only read two episodes of the script so far and I have nightmares each night…and that’s just reading the first two parts! Normally I’m already afraid of ghosts, now I don’t even watch horror movies but I have to star in a horror lakorn. I’m afraid already just reading it especially of the scene where I have to drink the nectar of the ghosts and become a ogress. I’ve taken it and dreamt about every scene as if it was real. When I wake up, which is around 3 A.M. I can’t go back to sleep, I’m really scared.""
Like the original when Woranut Wongsawan mentioned how frightening the role for the lakorn would be, Yui Jiranan also desired that it be shocking to act in.
Chiranan Manochaem recently interviewed that her role for the good person doesn't benefit her but the role of the bad character can bring her an award.

Golden Blue

Golden Blue is an album by St. Christopher released on Parasol Records in 2000. The album received mixed reviews, with Martin C. Strong in "The Great Indie Discography" calling it "an album too far". "Allmusic's" Stewart Mason was a little more complimentary, picking out "The First or the Last" (which he described as having a "glorious fuzztone and reverb guitar sound") and "Low", which he called "a neo-psychedelic gem", although he describes listening to the album as "a rather frustrating experience". The "Philadelphia Weekly" writer Elisa Ludwig rated the album D+, commenting "most of these tunes are simply not strong enough to carry their load of maudlin, syrupy excess". "PopMatters'" David Fufkin was more impressed, stating "again, Parasol has a winner".

WAGR S class

The WAGR S Class is a class of 1067mm narrow gauge 4-8-2 Mountain-type steam locomotives built by the Western Australian Government Railways, with construction beginning in 1943. 
The class was initially intended for service on both passenger and goods services on the Eastern Goldfields Railway between Perth and Kalgoorlie, though following the Second World War they worked primarily on the South West mainline. After suffering from a range of early problems (which led to controversy involving the designer Frederick Mills) the class became highly popular and was very successful, remaining in service until the very end of steam operation in Western Australia in 1972.
The locomotives were given running-board nameplates and were named after Western Australian mountains, following the tradition established 5 years earlier with the Pr Class pacifics, which were named after Western Australian rivers.
Details of Design.
The S Class locomotives were built as "Mountain" types, with a 4-8-2 wheel arrangement, a configuration commonly used in Australia for heavy goods locomotives, smaller driving wheels giving increased power output but with reduced speed.
Operational history.
Background.
In the 1920s and 1930s the West Australian rail systems were thoroughly run down. The vast majority of locomotives were well past their useful service life and many were badly in need of repairs. The P and Pr Class pacifics had helped alleviate pressure on aging passenger locomotives when introduced in 1924 and 1938 respectively, but more powerful machines were needed.
Later history.
Three examples have survived into preservation. S549 "Greenmount" is preserved in working condition by Rail Heritage Western Australia, S542 "Bakewell" is plinthed at East Perth Terminal, once the site of the East Perth Loco Depot. S547 "Lindsay" is preserved on the Bellarine Railway in Victoria.

Spys4Darwin

Spys4Darwin was an American supergroup established in 2001. The short-lived project featured members from Seattle-based groups Queensrÿche and Alice in Chains as well as the frontman of Michigan-based outfit, Sponge. Spys4Darwin began with guitarist Chris DeGarmo and drummer Sean Kinney, two friends who had both recently performed with Jerry Cantrell during his solo tour. They were soon joined by bassist Mike Inez and vocalist Vin Dombroski to fill out the band and began jamming in Binge Studios, an abandoned paint factory in Seattle. The project marked DeGarmo's first creative work since departing from his long-held position in Queensrÿche in 1998.
Name origin.
DeGarmo claimed that the band's name came from a curious man named Darwin that stayed in a lean-to near their studio. He volunteered to act as security while they performed despite not being able to access the studio himself. One day, Darwin told DeGarmo and Kinney that he was to embark on a trip and asked that they look after his belongings. DeGarmo allegedly looked to Kinney and said "So I guess now we’re spies for Darwin."
"microfish".
Spys4Darwin produced only a single album, a 6-track EP entitled "microfish", which consisted of one week's worth of recorded jams. While all band members contributed to the songs, much of the compositions were developed by DeGarmo and Kinney communicating back and forth while all lyrics were handled by Dombroski. In an interview, DeGarmo cited hopes to release a full-length album of about a dozen tracks in early 2002. The band was also reportedly working on the album as late as February 12 that year. However, a second album would ultimately not come to fruition.
"microfish" consists of recordings from Binge Studios which were refined at Chris DeGarmo and Sean Kinney's houses before being mixed by Adam Kasper at Studio X. Spys4Darwin released the EP on their own record label, Pied Viper Records. Originally only available through the band's official website, "microfish" was promoted through the band itself and a modest grassroots approach. In January 2008, long after the Spys4Darwin had disbanded and their website expired, the EP was made available through CDBaby.com. The group performed one gig at KNDD's Endfest 10 on August 4, 2001. Other bands in attendance included Nickelback, Ours, and The Crystal Method. 
According to DeGarmo, regarding the band's approach to "microfish":
Reception.
Critic Malcolm Dome of "Classic Rock" gave the album a positive review, calling it "pretty seamless and thoroughly entertaining":
Post-Spys4Darwin.
In 2002, the members of Spys4Darwin had begun to move on to different projects. April 2002 saw the death of Layne Staley, a longtime band mate to both Kinney and Inez. This put Alice in Chains into official hiatus with Inez rumored to replace Metallica's Jason Newsted later that year. DeGarmo contributed to the Jerry Cantrell single, "Anger Rising," before temporarily rejoining Queensrÿche to write material for their ninth album in 2003. Meanwhile, Vin Dombroski and Sponge band mate Joey Mazzola recruited three new members to record their 2003 effort, "For All the Drugs in the World".

Le Petit Bonhomme Janvier ("Little Man January") is a character in American folklore. He is part of the Cajun culture of Louisiana. Le Petit Bonhomme Janvier is said to pass on New Year's Day, when children may receive fruits, candy, or some time other special gift.
In some articles Bonhomme was a trickster (or "un joueur") that would place some baubles/candy in the shoes of little children when they were obedient all year and the other things when they were not so during the year.
For the bad children, he would insist that the real treat was handed out when something foul was left in the shoe. Other articles state that he was a little man that even visited adults bringing "sacks of treats filled with oranges, pecans, candy, coloring books and crayons."

Thomas Wijck

Thomas Wijck (also Thomas Wijk, or Thomas Wyck; 1616–1677) was a Dutch painter of port views and genre paintings.
Biography.
Wijck was born into an artist family and received his training from his father. He journeyed to Italy, presumably by 1640, the year in which a ‘Tommaso fiammingo, pittore’ (Thomas the Fleming, painter) is documented as residing in Rome in the Via della Fontanella. Although this evidence of his residence in Rome around this time has been questioned, a number of his pictures depict scenes in and around Rome which would indicate a visit to the city at some point. He also resided in the environs of Naples, where he executed many sketches which he subsequently worked up into drawings of coast views.
In 1642 Wijck returned to the northern Netherlands, where he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. In 1660 he was appointed Dean of the Haarlem Guild.
He went to England about the time of the Restoration and was much employed. He was followed there by his son and pupil Jan Wyck, who remained in Britain for the rest of his career and played an important role in the development of English sporting painting. Thomas Wyck was also the teacher of the Haarlem painter Jan van der Vaart, who later also immigrated to England.
He died in Haarlem in August 1677. Pieter Mulier II was a follower of his style.
Work.
He excelled in Italianate paintings of shipping and seaports, populated with many figures, very frequently odd characters such as alchemists and misers. His style resembles that of the loose group of Dutch and Flemish genre painters working in Rome who are called the 'Bamboccianti' and were influenced by the genre paintings of Pieter van Laar. He also painted fairs, public markets, and the interiors of chemists’ laboratories.
Thomas Wijck's painting of an alchemist is said to have influenced Joseph Wright of Derby's similar picture. Both pictures contain similar vaulting, a confusion of objects and an assistant who is singled out by the light.
Thomas Wijck painted a View of London before the fire, and another of the north bank of the Thames, from Southwark, exhibiting the mansions of the nobility in the Strand. He also painted the “Fire of London” more than once.

Hub Kittle

Hubert Milton "Hub" Kittle (February 19, 1917 – February 10, 2004) was an American professional baseball pitcher, manager and front office executive in the minor leagues and a pitching coach at the Major League level. When he took the mound for the Triple-A Springfield Redbirds in an official American Association game on August 27, 1980, at the age of 63, Kittle, a longtime minor league hurler whose professional career began in the 1930s, became the only man ever to pitch in professional baseball in six decades. He retired the Iowa Oaks on 11 pitches.
22 years as a minor league pitcher.
Kittle was born in Los Angeles, California, and attended San Diego State University. As a player, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He began his pitching career in 1937 with the Ponca City Angels of the Class C Western Association, a farm club of the Chicago Cubs. Two years later, Kittle won 20 of 30 decisions pitching for the Yakima Pippins of the Class B Western International League — beginning a long association with professional baseball in Yakima, Washington, and the Pacific Northwest.
Including his two years of military service during World War II, Kittle's active pitching career prior to his 1980 Springfield appearance spanned 22 years (1937–1955, plus cameos as a fill-in pitcher during his minor-league managerial career in 1958, 1966 and 1969). His appearance in the 1970s came in a Major League uniform during his tenure as the pitching coach of the Houston Astros, when he hurled in an exhibition game against the Detroit Tigers at the Astrodome at the age of 56 in . All told, as a minor league pitcher, Kittle won 144 games and lost 115 (.556). He won 7 games and lost 6 during his three stints (1940–41; 1943) at the highest minor league level, in the Pacific Coast League.
Minor league manager and executive.
Kittle's minor league managerial career was almost as long as his pitching tenure. It extended for 20 years (1948–1959; 1964–1970; 1977); he won regular season pennants with the 1950 Salt Lake City Bees in the Pioneer League, the 1953 Terre Haute Phillies of the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League and the 1956 Yakima Bears of the Northwest League.
In addition, Kittle was general manager of the Yakima Bears of the Northwest League, and the Hawaii Islanders and Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast circuit. He was selected Minor League Executive of the Year (lower classification) by The Sporting News in 1960. Kittle managed in the Philadelphia Phillies, Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals organizations. His career managerial record was 1,329 victories and 1,250 defeats (.515).
Major League coach for Astros and Cardinals.
Kittle finally reached the Major Leagues in when he was named an Astros' coach by manager Harry Walker. He spent five years on Houston's MLB staff, and was the team's pitching coach in 1973, working with celebrated pitchers such as Larry Dierker, J. R. Richard and Don Wilson. In 1976, he joined the Cardinals' organization, and spent the rest of his career with the Redbirds as a minor league manager, roving minor league pitching instructor, and Major League pitching coach from 1981–83. He was the pitching coach for the 1982 World Series champion Cardinals.
He was still working with St. Louis' minor league pitchers as he neared his 80th birthday. "He's the Santa Claus of pitching coaches," Cardinals' field coordinator of instruction George Kissell said in 1989. "Only he can't come down the chimney anymore, his bag is so full of tricks. Nobody teaches pitching like he does."
Kittle died at age 86 in Yakima from complications of kidney failure and diabetes.

Picón Bejes-Tresviso

Picón Bejes-Tresviso is a blue cheese from Cantabria, in the north of Spain. It has been protected under Denominación de Origen (DO) legislation since 1994, prior to which it was traditionally known as "Picón de Tresviso" and "Queso Picón de Bejes". The designated area centers in the Liébana valley and production is restricted to the municipalities of Potes, Pesaguero, Cabezón de Liébana, Camaleño, Cillorigo de Liébana, Peñarrubia, Tresviso and Vega de Liébana.
Production.
A mixture of cow's, sheep's and goat's milk is used in its production. The curd is created using a precise dose of rennet and cut into hazelnut-sized pieces, which are then drained and allowed to dry. The curd pieces are placed loosely in the mould, allowing sufficient air to circulate and initiate the growth of penicillium spores. The cheese is then salted and left for an initial drying and curing period of between 12 and 18 days, at a temperature between . 
Although much of the process thus far may take place in modern industrial units, DO regulations stipulate that final maturity be achieved by further curing in a natural limestone cave, typical of the geology of the Liébana region, for a minimum of two months. Maturation in this cool, high-humidity environment develops the particular taste and brevibacterium-infested crust typical of many blue cheeses. Since brevibacterium is responsible for human foot odour, it gives the cheese a characteristic, highly pungent aroma.
Characteristics.
The finished cylindrical cheese may be between high and have a diameter of , weighing anything between and . The rind is thin and grey to yellow-green in colour. The flesh is a smooth, white and compact, with streaks and patches of teal-coloured veins and a powerful, slightly spicy flavour. Acidity values in the fat content of the cheese have been shown to increase by a factor of twenty over the uncured curd.
Marketing.
Prior to DO regulation, it was often sold wrapped in Sycamore Maple ("Acer pseudoplatanus") leaves and is still marketed this way locally, albeit without the DO certification label. It is more widely available wrapped in a gold aluminum foil that permits stamping with an authentication seal and serial number. As result, leaf-bound Picón Bejes-Tresviso cheese is rarely found outside of the Liébana region.

Opinion polling has been commissioned throughout the duration of the 49th New Zealand Parliament and in the leadup to the 2011 election by various organisations. The main four are Television New Zealand, TV3, "The New Zealand Herald" and Roy Morgan Research. The sample size, margin of error and confidence interval of each poll varies by organisation and date.

Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of "don't know" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between survey firms.
Graphical summary.
The first graph below shows trend lines averaged across all polls for parties that have consistently polled on average above the 5.0% threshold. The second graph shows the parties polling over 1% which do not consistently poll above the 5.0% threshold. 
Concern over validity.
A new polling company, Horizon, has challenged some of the existing polls' validity as they exclude undecided voters and those who chose not to vote. Horizon claim that this may be up to 30% in some polls. However, Horizon's own polling methods have been criticised for their use of a self-selected internet panel.
At the 2008 election only the Green Party gained a proportion of the party vote outside (below) what poll trends would suggest.

Ali Sina (activist)

Ali Sina is an Iranian former Muslim and a strong critic of Islam, which he left, and the founder of Faith Freedom International, which he describes as a grassroots movement of ex-Muslims.
Ali Sina asserts that thousands of Muslims have left Islam after reading his articles and books.
Background.
Born and raised in Iran, educated in Italy & Pakistan, and now living in Canada, he began debating with people in the 1990s. What bothered him, he tells "The Jerusalem Post", was not the penchant for jihad and intolerance that certain crazy people calling themselves Muslims displayed, but the foundation for such ills in the so-called texts.
"The Jerusalem Post" writes, "Sina, who runs Faith Freedom International – an Internet forum dedicated to debunking Islam – considers himself 'probably the biggest anti-Islam person alive.' His latest book is titled, "Understanding Muhammad: A Psychobiography of Allah's Prophet" In it, Sina suggests that the prophet suffered from a series of mental disorders, including narcissistic personality disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy and obsessive compulsive disorder. "These disorders," he says, "can explain the phenomenon known as Islam... which is nothing but one man's insanity."
Through the Faithfreedom.org Web site, Sina lists references to Muhammad's actions and offers $50,000 to anyone who can disprove his charge that the prophet was "a narcissist, a misogynist, a rapist, a pedophile, a lecher, a torturer, a mass murderer, a cult leader, an assassin, a terrorist, a madman and a looter".
"With violent conquest and contempt for non-believers central to the tenets of the faith," Sina argues, "attempts to forge a moderate form of Islam are doomed... The only way to reform Islam is to throw away the Koran; 90 percent of it should be thrown away. You also have to throw away the history of Islam, and you have to completely disregard the Sira" – the Arabic term used for the various biographies of Muhammad, from which historical information about his life and the early period of Islam is derived.
In his October 2010 speech during the inauguration of the Freedom Party in Germany, Geert Wilders, leader of the third largest party in Netherlands said, “Ali Sina, an Iranian Islamic apostate who lives in Canada, points out that there is one golden rule that lies at the heart of every religion – that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. In Islam, this rule only applies to fellow believers, but not to Infidels. Ali Sina says ‘The reason I am against Islam is not because it is a religion, but because it is a political ideology of imperialism and domination in the guise of religion. Because Islam does not follow the Golden Rule, it attracts violent people.’”
On reforming Islam.
For this reason, Sina says that extremism in all religions can be eradicated if certain people are quieted, or if the followers are encouraged to embrace the universalist elements of their faith – but without addressing the extremism inherent in the religion's texts.
"People ask whether Islam can undergo a reformation like the one that Christianity underwent. That's a poor parallel," he says. "In Christianity, it wasn't the religion that needed to be reformed, but the church; what Jesus preached was good." On the other hand, Sina continues, "In Islam, it's the religion that is not good."
Arguing that Islam cannot be reformed, Sina says, "This is the way to fight evil. I do not want to kill the enemy. I want to win them as friends and allies. That is the real victory. In this way, we win because we eliminate our enemy, and our enemy wins by eliminating his ignorance and hate. That is why I believe in my cause. That is why I think I am an instrument of peace."
While disagreeing with Ali Sina for saying Islam is not a religion but a political ideology, Robert Spengler writing in the "Asia Times" compares that claim to Immanuel Kant’s who said Judaism is not a religion but a set of laws and rejects both. Robert Spengler continues “Ali Sina and other Muslim secularizers are just as wrong. I shall argue that Islam is both a religion and a political ideology. Religion is what makes Islamic political ideology so dangerous.” He adds, “Ali Sina is wrong: Islamic expansionism arises from religious motives, that is, a holy rage against the encroachment of death upon traditional society. In the form of Islam, the West confronts a challenge quite different from communism.”
Stop Islamization of Nations.
Sina is a board member of Stop Islamization of Nations (SION), an organization founded by Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer and Anders Gravers of Stop Islamisation of Europe (SIOE), and listed by the SPLC and ADL as a hate group. Other board members are Wafa Sultan, Ex Muslim activist and author; Stefan Herre, a German activist of Politically Incorrect; Mordechai Kedar, the Israeli author; Babu Suseelan, a Hindu activist; Oskar Freysinger a Swiss politician, Cliff Kincaid, editor of the Accuracy in Media (AIM) Report, and Ashraf Rameleh the President of Voice of the Copts. Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer are President and Vice President of SION.
A Biopic about Muhammad.
On September 25, 2012, LA Times announced Ali Sina is working on a biopic of the Prophet Muhammad. The movie will cost a total of 10 million dollars and he hopes to start filming in 2013. “Sina began contemplating a biopic about Muhammad a decade ago,” writes LA Times “but stepped up his effort in the last two years as technological advances made it feasible to circumvent government censors and wary exhibitors. “We can bypass theaters completely and sell the movie online with a profit to a large number of people, especially Muslims," Sina said. "They can download it and watch it even if they are living in Karachi or Mecca or Medina."

Before being elected to Portland's City Council in 2008, Fritz was known as a neighborhood activist, a critic of City Hall, and a seven-year member of the Portland Planning Commission. She was also the first candidate to win public financing under Portland's Clean Elections system in 2006, though she lost to incumbent Dan Saltzman in the first round of that year's election.
She was elected to City Council in the November 2008 election. She succeeded Commissioner Sam Adams, who vacated the seat to run for mayor.
Fritz was born in England. She has two sons and a daughter. In 1999, Fritz was noted as a Planning Commission member who valued an emerging online list for contributing to the discourse on planning in the city.
In 2008 Fritz became the first non-incumbent to successfully run under Portland's public financing system. She took the most votes in the May primary election (43%) in a field of six candidates, and faced second place finisher Charles Lewis (13%) in a November runoff election. Fritz and Lewis were among the candidates who each qualified for $150,000 in public financing by collecting over 1,000 five-dollar contributions, and pledging to accept no other campaign contributions. Each received an additional $200,000 for the runoff election. Fritz defeated Lewis with 70% of the vote in the runoff. Fritz was also the first candidate to qualify for public funds under the program, in her first race, when she challenged incumbent Dan Saltzman in the 2006 election. In the 2008 race, her decisive victory in the primary enabled her to reach out to new classes of constituents; she was noted for expanding her appeal from neighborhood activists to the business community, and placing a strong emphasis on fiscal responsibility.
She has been an advocate of the system since that first race, and wrote in support of it after winning the 2008 election. Voters overturned it via referendum in 2010. Fritz credits the Public Campaign Finance system for allowing her the independence that led to saving Portland ratepayers $500 million by changing policy choices in the Portland Water Bureau in 2009.
In June 2013, a shuffling of bureaus among the commissioners by new Mayor Charlie Hales saw Fritz assigned the Parks Bureau and the Bureau of Development Services, in place of her previous assignments.

Walka Water Works

Walka Water Works is a 19th century pumping station located near Maitland, New South Wales, Australia. Originally built in 1887 to supply water to Newcastle and the lower Hunter Valley, it has since been restored and preserved and is part of Maitland City Council's "Walka Recreation and Wildlife Reserve".
History.
Waterworks.
During the early 1880s, with a growing population in Newcastle, the NSW Government commenced construction of the Walka Waterworks to provide a safer water supply to the Newcastle, Maitland, Morpeth and Cessnock districts than existing storage tanks, creeks and boreholes. It was largely complete by 1887 at a cost of £170,000.
The design for the complex was undertaken by notable English engineer Sir William Clark and was a major engineering project for the area at the time. Water was pumped from the Hunter River to a reservoir along a brick tunnel approximately in diameter and below ground. At full operation, it had three pumping engines (150 hp each and with a flywheel weighing 36 tonnes), two horizontal compound pumps and a triple expansion surface condensing pump engine. Water would be pumped from the river at Oakhampton up to the Walka reservoir (still visible as the Walka lake today), then pumped onwards to another reservoir away at Buttai; where it was "gravitationally distributed". 
At peak operation the waterworks produced 3843 megalitres (in 1915). As the population of the area continued to increase, alterations and additions were made to the system until 1913, when other sources of supply were developed - namely Chichester Dam near Dungog. From 1923 to 1940 the waterworks were used as a backup water supply only.
In 1925 the complex was put on standby and with the onset of the great depression and the completion of Tarro pumping station at Tarro, the plant was closed in 1929. After the Second World War in 1949 all the plant and machinery was sold for scrap, fetching £2,500.
Power Station.
Two years later, in 1951, the site was reopened as a temporary coal power station by the Electricity Commission to overcome post-war electricity shortages. What was described as a "package power plant" was bought from General Electric and imported from America. The plant was shipped out in pieces, then taken to the site by rail (to Maitland station) and a specially made truck. GE engineers also came out to assemble the plant. 
It began producing electricity in 1953. Three boilers ran on coal, and another ran on oil, though later this became a coal/oil combination. Two rail lines were built to the power station from the North Coast railway line.
Using Walka as a power station was controversial. Initially the power station suffered from sinking foundations - leading to the temporary sacking of 120 workers, until it was agreed that the sinking was a result of recent rain. During construction, the workforce went on strike after a boilermaker union member was sacked for "misconduct" towards his foreman. This was eventually resolved, but in December 1953 the power station suffered another setback when one of its oil storage tanks collapsed in gale force winds. The station was also unpopular with local vegetable growers, who complained about the amount of soot the station was producing.
This station was eventually decommissioned in 1978 and the site was closed.
Recreation and Wildlife Reserve.
Not until 1984 were there definite attempts to reopen the site. At this time a Trust was formed, aiming to open the site and restore the Waterworks complex. The complex had been classified by the National Trust in 1976. Today the area is open as a free public reserve, with barbecues, picnics areas, a playground, walking trails and a 7 1/4 inch gauge miniature railway that operates passenger rides each Sunday. The reservoir and surrounding plant life make it a unique environment for birds and animals in the area.

Tus Hoisdorf is a German association football club from the municipality of Hoisdorf, Schleswig-Holstein. The footballers are part of a sports club that includes departments for badminton, gymnastics, table tennis, volleyball, and fitness programs.
__TOC__
History.
The little known club enjoyed its greatest success through the 1980s and 90s when it was part of third and fourth tier competition. "Hoisdorf" won its way into the Amateuroberliga Nord (III) in 1988 and spent a single season in the newly formed Regionalliga Nord (III) in 1994–95 before being relegated to the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (IV). During this period "TuS" twice appeared (1989–90) in the preliminary rounds of the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) tournament. After a second place finish in the Oberliga in 1998, they took part in a failed promotion round playoff being beaten by "BV Cloppenburg" (2:1, 0:6). Despite another second place result in 2001, the team voluntarily withdrew from higher level regional play. Today, the team competes in the Kreisliga Stormarn (VIII).

Noojee railway line

The Noojee railway line is a closed railway line in Victoria, Australia. Branching off from the Gippsland line at Warragul station, it was built to service the timber industry in the upper Latrobe River area, transporting timber as well as providing a general goods and passenger service to townships in the area. The final section of the line between Neerim South and Noojee traversed increasingly hilly terrain and featured a number of large timber trestle bridges. Extensively and repeatedly damaged by bushfires over the years, the line was closed in the 1950s and dismantled. The last remaining large trestle bridge on the line has been preserved and has become a popular local tourist attraction.
History.
Only a few years after the opening of the Gippsland mainline to Sale, townships along the upper reaches of the Latrobe River began to petition for a branch line to be built to service the area and by 1885 a route had been approved by Parliament from Warragul via Buln Buln. There was some dispute regarding the route, with a deputation meeting the Minister for Railways in 1888 to request the line be built from Longwarry rather than Warragul, following the Tarago River along an easier alignment and providing a shorter route to Melbourne. The Premier, Duncan Gillies, advised that the route could not be changed, and the line opened in sections with Warragul to Rokeby opened on 12 May 1890, and Rokeby to Neerim South on 18 March 1892.
Before the year was out, representations were being made to extend the line from Neerim South to Neerim proper. However, the line progressed no further as the Railways Standing Committee found that traffic on the proposed extension would not justify the £19,000 ($38,000) expenditure. Options for a more cheaply built extension, including the possibility of it being built as a narrow gauge railway were to be considered.
With the opening up of Crown lands in the Noojee and Fumina districts in the early 20th century, areas with poor rail and road transport, there was a renewed push for the railway to be completed. Extension of the line to Noojee via Neerim and Nayook had commenced by 1915, and on 27 March 1917 the long extension was opened from Neerim South to Nayook, climbing from an elevation of to . Construction continued on the final section into Noojee, over which the line descended , and it was opened on 26 April 1919. 
There was considerable optimism for the future prospects for the railway. "The Argus" newspaper reported that in addition to timber traffic paying its way, the line, which extended "into a most picturesque part of Gippsland", would soon develop a profitable tourist traffic. 
However, even as the railway was being officially opened, the roads that would ultimately lead to its closure were already on the way. John Mackey, the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly and member for West Gippsland, announced during the opening ceremony that the Country Roads Board had made funds available for the building of roads into the region and was now awaiting contractors willing to undertake the construction works. 
With the completion of the railway into Noojee, timber production in the area boomed. More than 200 kilometres of narrow gauge tramlines were built to link the surrounding mills to the railway
terminus. At least 28 timber mills were in operation between 1919 and 1926, when bushfires swept through the region and destroyed the township.
Infrastructure.
The broad gauge line was built to Victorian Railways "light lines" standard with 60 lb/yd (30 kg/m) rail. The ruling gradient was 1 in 40 between Warragul and Neerim South, and 1 in 30 between Neerim South and Noojee. As of 1923, it featured three turntables along its length: a table at Neerim South, and tables at Nayook and Noojee. Passenger trains were permitted to travel at speeds of up to , while goods trains were restricted to 
Services.
The line saw the use of Victorian Railways V class 2-8-0, K class 2-8-0 and N class 2-8-2 steam locomotives.
Passenger services were relatively slow, as was the case for many branch lines where a mixed goods and passenger train service was provided. Victorian Railways passenger timetable of 1928 shows a travel time from Melbourne to Noojee of approximately six hours for the journey from Flinders Street Station, which included lengthy stops at Warragul and Neerim South. 
Although by 1930 services into Noojee had only been running for just over ten years, Victorian Railways, faced with mounting losses that would result in a record £1 million deficit, announced the closure of the daily passenger rail service from 30 June 1930. It was replaced by twice-daily road motor services, with a journey time reduced by two hours, and additional services were available for market days on Thursdays. Use of the railway line was reduced to the three goods trains per week needed to clear goods traffic.
Bushfire damage.
With much of the line traversing dense eucalyptus forests, the line and the towns it served were at high risk of bushfire damage. 
In February 1926, the town of Noojee (including the railway station) and much of the line from Nayook was destroyed in the Black Sunday bushfires. The line was closed for repairs until 17 May 1926, with a road motor service being provided in the interim.
The town was again razed by fire in the Black Friday bushfires of Friday 13 January 1939, along with three of the large trestle bridges on the railway line between Nayook and Noojee. Of the £20,000 damage caused to Victorian Railways by the 1939 fires, the Noojee trestle was the most serious loss, with repairs taking several months.
Closure.
The lightly trafficked line was closed beyond Nayook on 27 March 1954. The section was last used when residents travelled by train to Warragul on 3 March 1954 to see Queen Elizabeth II during her first visit to Australia. The remaining section between Nayook and Warragul was closed in 1958.
Preservation.
After closure, the tracks and station buildings along the line were dismantled and many sections of the right of way were sold off. The Buln Buln Shire Council purchased the No. 7 Noojee trestle bridge from Victorian Railways for the nominal sum of £1 ($2). This historic eighteen-span structure, long and high, was one of three rebuilt in 1939 after the original structures were razed by the Black Friday bushfires. Architecturally significant as the tallest surviving timber trestle bridge in Victoria and a unique and intact example of trestle bridge construction, it is now registered with the National Trust of Australia.
Approximately of the rail formation around the Noojee Trestle Bridge has been converted into the Noojee Trestle Bridge Rail Trail. Further south towards Warragul, approximately of the formation has been converted into the Rokeby to Crossover Rail Trail.
In April 2012, the Noojee and District Historical Society were successful in a bid to relocate J class steam locomotive J550 from Warragul to Noojee for eventual restoration. The bid for the locomotive was part of a project to create an historical park in Noojee, featuring a restored rail line from Noojee railway station to the trestle bridge.
On the 24th of March 2013, J550 was moved by road to Noojee and placed on a section of track at the site of the former railway station.

Special Operations Capable

Special Operations Capable refers to special tasks that the tangible Marine Air-Ground Task Force units are capable in providing to the Fleet Marine Force (FMF), or foreign uniformed services of maritime regions worldwide. These task are similar to the roles that the United States Special Operations Forces are operationally responsible in providing the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).
Traditionally, the United States Marine Corps has been at the forefront of the United States's exceptional elite warriors. The special operations-type units within the Marine Corps eschewed the idea of being referred or compared to the traditional special operations forces (SOF) of the United States Special Operations Command due to the "ad hoc" idealism the Marines are traditionally known to carry—being special operations capable is temporary to their protocol.
The Marine Corps's specialized units have always yielded performance and mission plans that distinguish them from the United States Special Operations Forces. One significant detail is that the Marine Corps solely manages their battlespace shaping methods mainly in the aspect of conventional warfare. Most of the SOFs involved in USSOCOM however are more directed in unconventional warfare. Every SOC operations capable unit that existed in the Marine Corps are versatile enough to be capable in conducting special operations under 'unconventional' methods while engaging on a 'conventional' battlefield. While not specifically a Secretary of Defense-designated U.S. Special Operations Force, when directed by the National Command Authority and/or the force commander, the Fleet Marine Force may conduct special operations under circumstances where designated special operations forces are not available.
In February 2006, the Marine Corps made its first commitment to the USSOCOM community in cause of the establishment of the Marine Special Operations Command, or MARSOC. This new commitment allowed MARSOC to form the Marine Special Operation Teams (MSOT), assigned under the Marine Special Operation Battalions, or MSOBs. The MSOTs are the Marine Corps's first SOF unit to be trained and reserved for missions specifically regarding unconventional methods, which consequently disbanded the FMF's Force Reconnaissance companies to make way for the MSOTs' fully committed direct action capabilities. Many force reconnaissance operators were used to form the MSOTs, the rest were folded into the division-level recon units. The Deep Recon Platoons (DRP) were created to maintain the deep reconnaissance capabilities for the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders.
Therefore, the joint-Navy/Marine Corps's Fleet Marine Force is the proponent service for all special operations missions involving maneuverability from the sea. Historians can trace the evolution of the Corps’s specialized amphibious warfare since its formation, traditionally being tasked in conducting specialized missions conformed to maritime environments. The U.S. Marines and sailors are already equipped and well-prepared because of their expeditionary capabilities that are well-known to the community.
Concept.
There have been controversial effects of incorporating the MEU (SOC)'s capabilities. The Marine Corps periodically had to struggle with the Department of the Navy or Department of Defense in formulating a special operations force within the combined functions of the FMF. In fact, the FMF formulated several SOF-type units in the past. 
The Marine Raiders dissolved moments before the end of World War II, terminating their direct action-stylized institution. It was felt throughout the Marine Corps that the Raiders were acting in complex of being "an elite within the "Elite"", nonetheless the Raider Battalions were deactivated. Momentarily, the Paramarines also shared the same fate.
Ever since World War II, new threats that have been emerging became the main focus: terrorism, warring factions, and environmental catastrophes, while the worldwide population increases. Marines must now cope with the expected changes of the way warfare is being fought in the 21st century. Its reason is that the Marine Corps has epitomized its sole function in modern amphibious and expeditionary warfare. No other armed naval services throughout history has reasoned feasibly in sustaining a rapid, offensive landing force onto hostile shores, yet remaining co-dependent on conventional strategies. In order for the Corps to send Marines to accommodate new perils, recommendations were made to standardize and relate all their training for modern warfare. The Fleet Marine Force revised its Title X charter by incorporating their already ‘amphibious and expeditionary capability’ into unique missions; including a special operations mission, if the need arises.
A significant shift in thinking was dramatized by the foresight of then-Deputy Secretary of Defense William H. Taft, stated in 1983:
Despite efforts, the perception of competition between the SOFs and the specialized Marine units has persisted, and caused friction in USSOCOM.
Special Operations Capable (SOC).
In the past, the Marine Corps focused more on yesterday's high intensity, conventional, open "sea, air-land" battlefields, such as those expected during the Cold War. Nowadays, it has been replaced by the more probable mid- and low intensity conflicts. Missions that would require armed conflicts or humanitarian/disaster relief were conceived and many tacticians feared that the Marine Corps were trying to emulate the larger, land-based United States Army.
With counterparts from the United States Navy, Marines have the ability to be projected to any hostile area around the globe due to their maneuverability from the sea. This gives the Marine Corps the advantage over the other military branches; Marines can be deployed to a hostile situation, large or small, within short notice from the Commander-in-Chief.
Ever since the Advanced Base Force was conceived, the enhanced and inherent capabilities of the Fleet Marine Force has proven the Marine Corps operational flexibility as a unique, elite maritime force. The Marine Corps is far more capable of making the adjustments to the changing threat than any other service. Marine Corps Commandant General P. X. Kelley demonstrated capabilities of the Fleet Marine Force's, smaller forward deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements.
Each Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) has MEUs. When specifically trained and operationally qualified to perform special operational duties, they are then known as a Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable), or MEU (SOC); designed under the battle plans of combined maritime-based ground and air elements that make up a MAGTF.
Conventional operations.
Beyond those conventional missions assigned to a MEU, the specialized units within the Marine Corps's Special Operations Capable community are able to perform the following capabilities assigned:
Maritime special operations.
The Marine Corps does not deploy traditional Special Operations Forces (SOF). Forward-operating MEU(SOC)s receive enhanced training and are specially equipped and organized to provide selected maritime special purpose capabilities complementary and in support of special operations. In addition to the conventional capabilities noted above, MEU(SOC)s will, upon deployment, possess the following skills and
capabilities:
Pre-deployment Training Program (PTP).
Every 18-months, all units that are under the Marine Air-Ground Task Force's MEFs assemble the MEUs and train them individually within their units, or together in a cohesive exercise. They have one purpose, to become certified in special operations. The Special Operations Capable Certification process is in three phases; the Initial Training Phase, Intermediate Training Phase, and the Final Training Phase. Once certified, they are under status as "force-in-readiness" for 15-months.
Initial Training Phase.
The Initial Training Phase is the phase that focuses on training of individual personnel and small units of the Marine Expeditionary Units. Many Marines attend courses or training schools that may require advancement or additional skills to meet the demand of their unit's quota. Training and exercises by many cooperative cross-service agencies also help set courses of instruction for the MEU's Command Elements, subordinate elements (MSE), and the Maritime Special Purpose Force. Also, staff training is included in the MEU's CE and MSE elements. Because of time constraints and limited training resources, every effort must be made to efficiently use the training time available during this phase.
Intermediate Training Phase.
All the training and exercises that are conducted by the Marine Expeditionary Units while either on pre-deployment, or currently deployed, under a training curriculum, or not deployed operationally are during the Intermediate Training Phase. The purpose of this phase is to build unit cohesion and leadership, and emphasis on functioning as a team. A string of exercises are begun, and a MEU utilizes this time to rehearse for the upcoming Special Operations Capable Exercise that will determine their Special Operations Capable certification.
At the beginning of the Intermediate Training Phase, an operational analysis is conducted by the MEU Commander in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the subordinate elements. This will also assist in developing the commander’s guidance regarding training priorities. Once developed, the MEU Commander will provide training guidance to improve and sustain the MSE’s required capabilities.
Final Training Phase.
The Final Training Phase is the culmination of all predeployment training activities. Its focus is on preparation for the Special Operations Capable Exercise, and predeployment embarkation requirements.

United States Marine Corps Special Operations Capable Forces

The United States Marine Corps is assigned by the National Command Authority to be primarily the Department of Defense's expeditionary force-in-readiness, and the Department of the Navy's contingent landing force—amphibious by nature. Before 2006 (i.e., the formation of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC)), the Marine Corps was the only branch of the Armed Forces that did not have any of its special warfare elements participating in the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), due to confining its special operations capabilities only for the purpose to the Fleet Marine Force.
President Ronald Reagan approved the establishment of USSOCOM in April 1987; a month later the other military branches reassigned their own respective special operations forces (SOF) units to the USSOCOM Headquarters in Tampa, Florida at MacDill Air Force Base. However, as the Marine Corps was reluctant to make the subtle change, its specialized assets assigned to the FMF's Marine Air-Ground Task Forces are not recognized by the charter signed in 1987.
Commandant of the Marine Corps General Alfred M. Gray announced on 5 February 1988, that in response to the current and projected realities of the world, they were changing the designations of the Marine Air-Ground Task Forces that constitute its fighting formations. The word "amphibious" was replaced by "expeditionary". The new term signified that the Marine Corps would not be limited to amphibious operations but rather would be capable of a wide spectrum of operations in littoral areas around the world, in conventional and unconventional warfare.
Because of its status in expeditionary warfare, the Marine Corps fundamentally bases its combative strategy on its ground combat element—all air/ground elements are primarily organic support to the Marine infantry—arguing that strategic bombing does not win battles. Its assigned expeditionary roles assigned by the Unified Combatant Command requires it to be fully trained and functional either as a quick reaction or show of force to any place and environment around the globe within 24 hours. To become adaptive to the Fleet Marine Force protocol, it established its own specialized assets to support the Navy/Marine force commanders to suit its maritime (amphibious) light-infantry capabilities.
Active units.
Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.
The Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, or ANGLICO, are small Marine units that provide artillery, naval gunfire, close air support for the United States Armed Forces, as well to allied foreign armed forces worldwide. The ANGLICO teams are specialized in forward observation, joint terminal attack controlling, and forward air controlling. They give the Marine Air Ground Task Force commanders a liaison capability with foreign area expertise to plan, coordinate, employ and conduct radio communications for air, sea and land support fire for joint, allied and coalition forces. They also have parachutists used to insert into the battlefield rapidly for observance support.
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.
The Chemical Biological Incident Response Force is a rapid response force that is capable of being deployed to a combatant commander or United States Department of State legations and installations, and, when directed by the National Command Authority, anywhere in the world that is affected by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) incidents. The force is completely self-contained and self-sufficient, and may also provide coordinating initial relief efforts, security, detection, identification, expert medical advice, and limited decontamination of personnel and equipment.
This response force will respond to CBRNE incidents affecting to assist local civilian and military agencies in order to assist the on-scene commander in providing initial post incident consequence management. CBIRF consists of specially trained personnel and specialized equipment suited for operations in a wide range of contingencies. Through search and extraction, decontamination, and medical stabilization, CBIRF capabilities are intended to minimize the effects of a CBRNE incident.
MAGTF Reconnaissance.
Marine reconnaissance are specialized teams that are proficient in special, ground and amphibious reconnaissance to collect intelligence for the commanders within the Marine Air-Ground Task Force to shape the commander's battlespace. The division recon assets conduct recon for battalions and regiments by operating ahead of the forces to scout enemy and other pertinent information. The force recon assets are reserved for the high-echelon of the force commander. Force recon also may be directed to perform direct action operations or other special assignments to the Marine Expeditionary Force.
Marine Special Operations Command.
The Marine Special Operations Teams (MSOTs), are the Marine Corps's only fully committed, unconventional special operations unit that solely operate independent from the Fleet Marine Force. Their initial role is to provide the Marine Special Operation Command (MARSOC) in direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, and foreign internal defense. It first began as MCSOCOM Detachment One and consequently was reformed into a Marine Special Operations Battalion (MSOB). Most of the experienced personnel were from the disbanded FMF's recon companies of 1st and 2nd Force Recon and from a Naval Special Warfare Group; forming the 1st and 2nd MSOB.
Maritime Special Purpose Force.
The United States Marine Corps' Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF), are specialized sub-units of the Marine Expeditionary Units. They are deployed to give commanders low profile, two-platoon surgical emplacement in accessible littoral regions. The MSPF provides the MEU with rapid direct action capabilities, augmenting or replacing the unavailable Fleet Marine Force's recon platoons. It enables the Marine Corps's only deep recon unit, Force Recon, to continue providing FMF-"level" intelligence without delay. However, MSPFs can not operate independently of their parent MEU: they rely solely on the MEU for logistics, intelligence, communications, transportation, and fire support.
Special Reaction Teams.
The Provost Marshal’s Special Reaction Teams (SRT) are specialized military policemen that are trained in all aspects of special weapons and tactics. They have the ability to handle special threat situations surpassing normal law enforcement capabilities, such as: isolating a crisis scene, providing proficient marksmanship support, tactically responding from an assembly area to the scene, effecting an entry, and employing clearing techniques.
Deactivated units.
Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion.
The Amphibious Reconnaissance Company (and later Battalion) were a small group of men that conducted preliminary D-Day amphibious reconnaissance of the planned littoral beaches occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army and Special Naval Landing Forces in the Central Pacific during World War II. They were infantry Marines highly skilled in combat swimming, topography, and hydrographic survey that provided the V Amphibious Corps, which subsequently was redesignated under the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, vital military intelligence of Japanese enemy forces.
Combined Action Program.
The Combined Action Program (CAP), was a unit that was assembled as a foreign internal defense during the Vietnam War. They were jointly allied with the South Vietnamese Popular Force, providing 'civil protection force' for local villages from the Viet Cong's influence of terrorism, recruiting, and taxation.
Later, they were subsequently renamed the "Civil Action Platoons". The foreign relations between the two allied forces confided the villagers of in-sourcing information. It became one of the major sources of reliable intelligence from allies throughout the war.
Joint Assault Signals Company.
The Joint Assault Signals Company (JASCO) were a tri-service of the Army and the Fleet Marine Force (United States Navy/Marine Corps) that provided supporting arms coordination for ground artillery, ships, and aircraft in delivering ordnance. They were highly specialized fire support coordinators for close air and naval gunfire support.
Marine Special Operations Command Detachment One.
The MCSOCOM Detachment One (MarDet 1) was a pilot program to assess the value of Marine special operations forces permanently detached to the United States Special Operations Command. It was commanded by Col. Robert J. Coates, former commanding officer of 1st Force Reconnaissance Company along with Team leader Lt. Lawrence R. Gentile 1st Forecon Jump Master. Det 1 was activated on 19 June 2003 and had its headquarters at Camp Del Mar Boat Basin. It was disbanded in 2006 and succeeded by the permanent Marine Forces Special Operations Command, which is to be a 2700-person command.
Marine Corps Test Unit #1.
The Marine Corps Test Unit (MCTU #1), was a battalion-sized unit that was designed to be outside the political and command boundaries of the Fleet Marine Force to test and evaluate innovative methods in maneuvering ground forces that were prone to operating in areas subject to nuclear attacks. They initially developed the techniques for the heliborne assaults that are used in the Army and Navy today.
The Test Unit's infantry battalion participated in Desert Rock IV during shot 'Bee'. The reconnaissance platoon in MCTU #1 revolutionized the modern methods of parachute insertions and extractions. The Recon Platoon subsequently became the beginning of Force Reconnaissance.
Observer Group.
The Observer Group (precursor to Amphibious Reconnaissance Company) was a joint Army–Marine Corps unit that was the first in the United States and the Fleet Marine Force to be organized and trained specifically for amphibious reconnaissance. The Observer group experimented in the methodology and equipment in projecting "ship-to-shore" reconnaissance from the sea before the establishment of the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency), the Underwater Demolition Teams, and before the United States Army Special Forces and Air Commandos. It was also the birth of naval amphibious intelligence.
Parachute battalions.
The Paramarines (also known as "Marine paratroopers") were specialized units that were trained to parachute into combat. The first Paramarines were trained in October 1940. The Parachute battalions have jumped into hostile territory. They lacked heavy mortar and machine gun support due to the amount of equipment they were able to carry into combat in addition to having limited manpower. They were lightly equipped for many of the missions in the Pacific campaigns during World War II.
By 1944, the Parachute Battalions was disbanded, becoming another special operations unit deactivated under the Fleet Marine Force just like the Marine Raiders.
Raider battalions.
The Marine Raiders were elite units established in 1942 by the Marine Corps during World War II to conduct amphibious, light-infantry raiding missions, particularly in landing in rubber boats and operating behind the lines. "Edson's Raiders of 1st Marine Raiders Battalion and "Carlson's" Raiders of 2nd Marine Raiders Battalion are said to be the first United States Special Operations Forces to form and see combat.
Many "modern" raiding methods in the Marine Corps were derived and adopted by both Carlson's and Edson's Raiders, which subsequently the division-"level" recon scouts continued its long use after they were disbanded in 1944. It became known as direct action (DA) mission of today. Most of the experienced Raiders, along with the Paramarines, soon filled the ranks of division recon companies.
Anti-Terrorism Battalion.
The Anti-Terrorism Battalion was a specialized anti-terrorist task unit that possessed organic and supplemental capabilities in military intelligence and counter-intelligence, combat engineers, nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) teams, and advanced riflemen. On short notice, they would have deployed in response to crises during terrorist attacks. They would have also supplemented other NBC agencies as human intelligence exploitation teams (HET).

United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance

The reconnaissance mission within the United States Marine Corps is divided into two distinct but complementary aspects; Marine Division Recon and Force Reconnaissance.
The United States Marine Corps Reconnaissance Battalions (or commonly called Marine Division Recon) are the reconnaissance assets of Marine Air-Ground Task Force that provide division-level ground and amphibious reconnaissance to the Ground Combat Element within the United States Marine Corps. Division reconnaissance teams are employed to observe and report on enemy activity and other information of military significance in close operations. Their capabilities are similar to those of Force Recon, but do not normally insert by parachute, and provide limited direct action, whereas Force Reconnaissance companies perform both deep reconnaissance and direct action operations. Some of these missions are shared by Marine Special Operations Teams, a subordinate part of Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC).
History of MAGTF Reconnaissance.
The formation of a doctrine.
At the turn of the 20th Century, amphibious reconnaissance as we know it today in the United States Fleet Marine Force (FMF), was first conceived by a Marine officer, "then"-Major Dion Williams, who formulated the first official (maritime) naval doctrine concerning intelligence gathering for planning of operations; in theaters of amphibious warfare.
Williams' doctrine outlined a wide spectrum of reconnaissance, which consisted of:
He specified in his thesis that these Marines particularly needed to be competent in surveying, cartography, and recording observations, as well as reading previous maps and surveys of various types.
Although there was very little effect in creating a formidable unit because the outset of World War I and the Gallipoli Operations due to the lack of Marine Corp personnel by the Isolationism of 1920-1930s. Also drawbacks concurred while most of the Marine forces were engaged in conflicts of China and Nicaragua.
After World War I, three significant aspects of the second edition of Williams' "Naval Reconnaissance" included:
It was this latter emphasis on obtaining information long before hostilities that was perhaps of greatest significance. Rather than obtaining information solely for military operations in progress, Williams now enunciated a more comprehensive mission.
The earliest activities in amphibious reconnaissance was largely limited in surveying of ports, uncharted islands and adjacent beaches or coastlines. Most of these duties were billeted by senior Naval Intelligence Officers that were prerequisites in topography, hydrography, impermanent construction of fortification with the means of rapid encampment and mobilization of troops to operate in their area.
However, another Marine intel officer and amphibious reconnaissance war prophet, Earl H. Ellis, put most of William's concept to effect years later. After fighting in the trenches in WWI, in 1921, Ellis submitted a request to Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) for special intelligence duty in South America and the Pacific, in which he foresaw the built-up of Japanese naval forces that eventually led to the events of World War II; the Director of Naval Intelligence diligently accepted. It was during his special duty that introduced the most profound accounts of Ellis's intelligence reports. He submitted a 30,000 page Top Secret document ^ "Ellis" File, Advanced Base Defense During the Present War, HisDiv, HQMC</ref> concerning his detail discussion of local sea, air and the climate, various land terrain types, the native population and economic conditions. He discussed his reports on strategically seizing key islands as forward-operating bases for project naval forces effectively into the area. His time-tables, mobilization projections, and predictions of manpower necessary to seize certain targets. His maritime intelligence reports became paramount years later for the United States maritime forces, during the Pacific campaigns of World War II.
Testing the doctrine.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) first tested Williams conceptual methods of reconnaissance in the fourth series of the Fleet Landing Exercises (FLEX) in the Caribbean; for evaluation in establishing a naval reconnaissance doctrine for the Marine Corps. By 7 December 1933, the Fleet Marine Force was formed at HQMC in Quantico, VA, combining the roles of the Navy and Marine Corps into an integrated maritime (naval) assault force. Shortly after, a new naval doctrine, the "Fleet Training Publication 167" was created to ensure long-term purposes.
Although the subsequent tests encompassed more broadly in combined amphibious/ground reconnaissance efforts, its aerial reconnaissance elements cannot be overlooked since aircraft were both tested for direct combat support and reconnaissance. The aviation reconnaissance assets did not see further scrutiny until the outset of the Korean War.
Before World War II, the first radars were developed for anti-aircraft purposes. Subsequently, these were soon followed by fire control radars for ships and coastal artillery batteries. However, it wasn't until decades later that improvements to technology proved that radar systems were capable of locating artillery guns.
Patrons of the doctrine.
From 'sea-to-shore'.
The Marine Corps established its first specialized ground/amphibious reconnaissance unit, the "Observer Group", in 1941, which was formed for the upcoming secretive mission in North Africa (in preparation for "Operation Torch")—under the command of Captain James L. Jones, Sr. The unit was composed of skilled and highly proficient swimmers from the Army, Navy, and the Marine Corps. Momentarily, the Observer Group was ordered to be decommissioned, but not completely dissolved; the Marine unit was re-institutionalized as the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company. The remaining Army and Navy counterparts formed the "Scouts and Raiders" and continued its deployment to North Africa as planned. The Scouts and Raiders are the predecessor to the Navy Combat Demolition Units (NCDU), which subsequently became the Underwater Demolition Teams—the patrons of the prestigious Navy SEALs.
Preliminary—Ground operations.
The Amphibious Reconnaissance Company (still under command of Capt. James Jones) was directed to report to the joint-Navy and Army's Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet (ACPF). The United States Navy controlled many joint units of the Army and the Marine Corps. These units represented the sum total of the amphibious forces of the United States, with the exception of small units of the Fleet Marine Force, which had been trained for amphibious raids. The Amphib Recon Company was tasked to provide preliminary reconnaissance for the force commander of the ACPF.
By 1943, the Army ceded their role of amphibious assaults to the Navy and Marine Corps. Subsequently, the Marine subordinate units of the ACPF were re-designated under the full command of the Marine Corps's V Amphibious Corps (VAC)—and the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company shifted alongside under its new command.
In the next following years, the Company increased in manpower and the brevity of upcoming missions, forcing it to be re-designated to full battalion-strength with two active reconnaissance companies; becoming the "Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion". To include, VAC shifted its command under the Fleet Marine Force.
Prior to the arrival of Marines in this area of the Pacific War, the Australians had already established a network of deep reconnaissance agents known as the Australian Coastwatchers. They operated not only on coasts, but deep in jungles as well. Initially, some Marines became part of the unit.
Although, the force commanders of the VAC weren't the only ones to see the true value of ground and amphibious reconnaissance. The subordinate units of the Marine division and regiments resorted to their own avenues of reconnaissance methods.
The I Marine Amphibious Corps (I MAC) and III Marine Amphibious Corps (III MAC) approached its reconnaissance assets more differently than the V Amphibious Corps's (VAC) Reconnaissance platoons. The amphibious reconnaissance platoons of VAC were more associated to preliminary and amphibious reconnaissance, whereas the division and regimental commanders equated their decision-making process using terrestrial reconnaissance.
Reconnaissance-in-force operations.
In 1941, Lieutenant Colonel William "Wild Bill" Whaling, the executive officer of 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, established visualized and perceived the use for specialized missions encompassing reconnaissance at the division-level, which would be conducted above the normal infantry battalion-level in scouting and patrolling. He recommended to General Alexander Vandegrift the need of a special "Scout and Sniper unit" for the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal. Soon after, each of the three rifle companies that were used during the Guadalcanal campaign were tasked in sending one their best field craft Marines to devise the scout-sniper unit, with each regiment containing a Scout and Sniper Platoon, within the regimental headquarters and service company.
Momentarily, the regiments requested their scouts to be heavily reinforced with tanks for rapid mobility and increased firepower, to allow their scouting parties to determine a hasty, yet accurate account of their enemies potential and strengths—using a technique known as reconnaissance-in-force (RIF). RIF elicits determination of strength by offensively provoking the enemy for a reaction.
The close of World War II discontinued the use of amphibious reconnaissance, and momentarily the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion dismantled; all amphibious reconnaissance subsidiaries were under the direct control of the "only"-remaining division-level reconnaissance assets—ending force-level reconnaissance.
Close-distant operations.
The "Scout (Tank) and Sniper" companies later formed the Division Recon Battalions and Scout Sniper Platoons of today. By early-1980s, the Light Armored Reconnaissance units were formed to provided mechanized reconnaissance-in-force for infantry regiments. The responsibilities of the LAR battalions resemble those of the Scout (Tank) companies of World War II.
It wasn't until the highlight of the Korean War that foresaw the re-establishment of force-level reconnaissance; however, only 2nd Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion was created (1st Amphib Recon Bn remained inactive-only to be used as for training new amphibious reconnaissance candidates) in support of the Marine task force commanders' effort in pushing the Socialist Chinese forces north, from South Korea.
Deep operations.
The Korean War introduced the new concept of using rotary-wing aircraft to the Marine Corps in combat employment for logistics and rapid troop transport. During the mid-1950s, a recon test platoon from the Marine Corps Test Unit#1 experimented in various parachute insertions for deeper reconnaissance and pathfinding. In 1957, the command staff of the Recon Platoon, MCTU#1 relinquished the command of 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion and formed the 1st Force Reconnaissance Company.
When the Force Recon companies were established, they allowed the Fleet Marine Force commanders to obtain information quicker than the slower, processed intelligence that was provided by the division recon platoons, which went through each of the battalion's, regiment's, and division's intelligence sections before reaching the force level.
However, like the fate of the Marine Raiders and the Paramarines of World War II, 1st and 2nd Force Reconnaissance companies were disbanded, albeit temporarily, to make way for the Fleet Marine Force's 'first' unconventional asset that was created within the new Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC). The force reconnaissance companies were replaced under the command of the Marine Division's reconnaissance battalions while maintaining deep reconnaissance and force-oriented reconnaissance under the Fleet Marine Force.
MARSOC absorbs much of the unconventional operations in which Force Recon was previously was responsible, allowing the force recon platoons to fully exercise their initial role of providing "deep" and "preliminary reconnaissance" to the Command Element of MAGTF without interference.
Signals intelligence operations.
By 1986, new counter-battery radars were introduced. These radars were able to locate many artillery batteries simultaneously. In latter, the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan requested for a small, counter-mortar radar, given 360 degree coverage and requiring a minimal crew, for use in forward operating bases. In another back to the future step it has also proved possible to add counter-battery software to battlefield airspace surveillance radars.
MAGTF Security Operations.
Security operations reduces risk to operating Marine forces from unknown avenues that may conflict in any tactical situation; it encompasses surprise attacks from the enemy, counter-intelligence, and deception in the friendly forces' capabilities and intentions. In relation, reconnaissance operations support security operations by providing information on enemy forces, capabilities and intentions, and by denying the enemy information of friendly activities through counter-reconnaissance.
Through succession, security operations are usually integrated with its reconnaissance operations; in which force commanders acquire during offensive, defensive and other tactical operations. It greatly improves their decision-making process due to the collected information that is much needed to develop situational awareness and commander critical information requirements (CCIR).
The CCIR are designed to feed important, time-sensitive information to the commander so he can make a decision that should dramatically affect the battlespace. The CCIR is collectively, a comprehensive list of high-prioritized information in which a force commander identifies as "critical". It is much required to influence and facilitate timely information management and the decision-making process that may help dictate successful mission accomplishment. CCIR is divided into two key sub-components: "critical friendly force information" and "priority intelligence requirements".
Reconnaissance planning.
Reconnaissance supports the MAGTF commander’s intent and his CCIRs. While contributing to the commander’s broad situational awareness and development, reconnaissance assets tailor their efforts to support the specific CCIRs indicated by the commander’s intent and subsequent unit intelligence and operations planning. Simultaneously, reconnaissance forces must remain alert to any developments that may cause the commander to reassess that intent.
MAGTF reconnaissance assets are best employed early to support the CCIRs and friendly course of action development and selection. When reconnaissance is initiated early in the planning cycle, planning and execution are driven by the flow of solid, timely information and intelligence. If reconnaissance is delayed, situation development will generally be more uncertain. In this case, planning and execution can either take place in an information vacuum or be driven by the search for such information.
Reconnaissance assets are best employed in general support. Because of the nature of warfare, MAGTF reconnaissance units will most likely be employed in rapidly developing and fluid situations. The main effort may shift quickly from one subordinate element to another. Such situations often require modifications or complete changes in reconnaissance elements’ missions. The MAGTF commander and his staff are usually the most capable of determining the best use of MAGTF reconnaissance assets at any given time, to provide the necessary support, and to integrate the results of reconnaissance information with other intelligence sources. Although placing reconnaissance assets in direct support of some subordinate element or even attaching them to specific units is occasionally appropriate, in general, such support relationships make for inefficient use of specialized reconnaissance forces. Proper planning; the institution of flexible, responsive command and control and intelligence reporting procedures and networks; and clear intelligence reporting and dissemination priorities will ensure that the products of reconnaissance are shared to the maximum benefit of all potential users.
Reconnaissance requires adequate time for detailed planning and preparation. Most reconnaissance focuses on the enemy’s activities and intentions to satisfy the commander’s need to exploit the enemy’s vulnerabilities or to attack his center of gravity. This frequently necessitates operating in and around the enemy's most critical and best defended areas. This normally requires that reconnaissance be conducted over long distances and well in advance of commencement of the operations it will support. These conditions usually dictate specialized methods of transportation, communications and information systems support, combat service support, equipment, and coordination.
MAGTF Reconnaissance Assets.
All Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) elements uses its own unique reconnaissance capabilities; the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) utilizes aerial reconnaissance, but the Command Element (CE) and the Ground Combat Element (GCE) operate in combined amphibious/ground reconnaissance.
Command Element.
Force Reconnaissance.
The Force Reconnaissance companies report to the Command Element of the MAGTF. They are used for retaining any information that are held in deep operations under conventional warfare. They are very proficient in various entry and recovery methods in heliborne and waterborne techniques to insert behind enemy lines either by High-Altitude/Low (or High) Opening parachute landings; or combatant diving in submarine surface and subsurface methods. This ensures they achieve and maintain stealth in order to avoid compromising their mission. The Fleet Marine Force's detachable force reconnaissance platoons can operate independently from the support Marine Expeditionary Units if needed, making them special operations ""capable"" in forward-operated areas.
Because the division reconnaissance assets are heavily tasked in providing regiment commanders vital information; the force commander's intelligence staff are able to make the necessary preparations or changes in the future, shaping the battlespace. It is mainly due because the division-"level" intelligence may not be retrieved at a fast pace for adjusting the needs of the force commander. Also, force-"level" reconnaissance is retained under the direct control of the force commander, enabling him to send his force recon assets at his will. This may include non-reconnaissance avenues, such as direct action operations under the commander's proposal; the same methods performed by the "more-"'unconventional' special operations forces of USSOCOM.
NOTE: Both 1st and 2nd Force Reconnaissance companies have been deactivated since c. 2006. However the Marine Corps is in the process of standing up these units in the near future. 'Force Recon' companies were re-established, starting on December 19, 2008, within the 1st and 2nd Marine Division's reconnaissance battalions to maintain expedient "deep recon" capabilities within the II Marine Expeditionary Force.
Radio Battalion.
The Radio Reconnaissance Platoons provides ground-based signals intelligence, electronic warfare, communications security monitoring, and special intelligence communications capability to support MAGTF operations. It plans and coordinates the employment of its subordinate elements, to include radio reconnaissance elements beyond the Forward Edge of Battle Area and mobile electronic warfare support system in light armored vehicles. It is the focal point for MAGTF ground-based signals intelligence operations. They are also used to augment the Force Recon platoons in proving communications relay, when the Force Recon assets are unavailable.
Remote sensors and imagery interpretation.
The intelligence battalion provides remote sensor, imagery interpretation, and (GEOINT) support to MAGTF operations. In addition to the sensor control and management platoon (SCAMP), the force imagery interpretation unit, and the topographic platoon, the intelligence company establishes and mans the MAGTF’s surveillance and reconnaissance center. It plans, executes, and monitors MAGTF reconnaissance operations.
Counterintelligence and human intelligence.
The intelligence battalion provides human intelligence (HUMINT), counterintelligence (CI), and interrogator-translator support to MAGTF operations. This support can include screening and interrogation/debriefing of prisoners of war and persons of intelligence interest; conduct of CI force protection source operations; conduct of CI surveys and investigations; preparation of CI estimates and plans; translation of documents; and limited exploitation of captured material. In addition to the specialized CI and interrogator-translator platoons, the company employs task-organized HUMINT Exploitation Teams (HET) in direct support of MAGTF subordinate elements. The HET combine CI specialists and interrogator-translators in one element, thereby providing a unique and comprehensive range of CI/HUMINT services.
Ground Combat Element.
The Ground Combat Element (GCE) has substantial organic reconnaissance support assets. Any units in contact with the enemy, especially patrols, are among the most reliable sources of information.
Division Reconnaissance.
The Marine Corps's Division Reconnaissance conduct reconnaissance in close operations to gather enemy intelligence at the division staff-"level". The mission of division reconnaissance is to provide immediate tactical reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S) to the GCE of MAGTF, whether it be amphibious or ground reconnaissance. Division recon, like force reconnaissance, is employed to observe and report on enemy activity and other information of military significance. In current theaters of operation they rely mostly on rapid mobilization via motor transport, traversing ahead of major Marine forces for intelligence contingency for division, regimental, or battalion commanders.
Division reconnaissance mainly do not operate in deep operations, they support the Marine (infantry) regiments by providing and ground reconnaissance to Marine division regimental and battalion commanders within the MAGTF's subordinate MEU; in contrast to force recon who supports the force commanders of the Fleet Marine Force and its subordinate MEF in deep reconnaissance and direct action missions.
Counterbattery Radar.
Counterbattery Radar (CBR) platoons are located within the headquarters battery of the artillery regiment. The CBR Platoon's primary mission is to locate enemy rocket, mortar, and artillery weapons and process all acquired enemy locations in a timely manner for counter-fire and intelligence purposes. Secondary missions that can be assigned by the supported artillery unit are adjusting or registering artillery. They are normally employed as a unit and controlled by the regimental artillery commander. The CBR platoon commander coordinates the employment of radars operating under regimental control. Information on enemy order of battle and locations derived from counter-battery radar detections are reported to the Ground Combat Element and the Command Element of MAGTF.
Light Armored Reconnaissance.
The division Light Armored Reconnaissance battalions provides the Ground Combat Element with its light armored reconnaissance capability by operating in forward areas or along the flanks of Marine ground forces. Initially, they are usually used to provide early warning of contact by hostile forces, acting as the 'mechanized' reconnaissance-in-force, but they are capable of a wide variety of missions due to their inherent mobility and organic firepower; such as quick reaction forces, and counter-insurgency support.
Scout-Sniper and Surveillance, Target, and Acquisition.
Scout Sniper Platoons are organic collection support assets to each infantry battalion. They are highly skilled in marksmanship, reconnaissance and surveillance, and target acquisition. Every Marine Scout Sniper can deliver long-range precision fire on selected targets from concealed positions. Although the platoon can be employed in support of a myriad of tactical missions in defensive and offensive operations, they are primarily employed to provide timely surveillance and tactical data and coordinate supporting arms and close air support. The Scout Sniper Platoon provides the infantry battalion with extended area observation. The Scout Sniper may be attached to the division and FMF reconnaissance companies.
Aviation Combat Element.
The capability of the ACE to observe the battlefield and report in near-real time gives the MAGTF commander a multidimensional capability that should be used at every opportunity. Aviation combat units can view the entire AO in depth, providing early indications and warning and reconnaissance information that can be essential to the success of the MAGTF. Each ACE aircraft (rotary- or fixed-wing), can conduct visual observation of terrain and enemy forces that it may fly over. Given the combined arms capability of the MAGTF, these aircraft can engage enemy targets immediately or direct other supporting arms against the enemy forces. The ACE manages the following reconnaissance systems.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
UAVs provide day-night, real-time imagery reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition. Its unique capabilities can also be used to support real-time target engagement, assisting in the control of fires/supporting arms and maneuver. The UAV provides high quality video imagery for artillery or naval gunfire adjustment, battle damage assessment, and reconnaissance over land or sea. It is capable of both day and night operations using TV or forward-looking infrared cameras. UAV squadrons are under the ADCON of the ACE. The MAGTF commander retains OPCON because of the limited number of UAV assets and the critical reconnaissance capabilities they provide to the entire force. Mission tasking is exercised through the surveillance and reconnaissance center.
Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System.
The F/A-18D can be equipped with the advanced tactical airborne reconnaissance system and the Radar Upgrade Phase II with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The advanced tactical airborne reconnaissance system is a real-time digital package providing day/night, all-weather imagery capability. The imagery collected provides sufficient detail and accuracy to permit delivery of appropriate air and ground weapons, assist with battle damage assessment, and provide tactical commanders with detailed information about the enemy’s weapons, units, and disposition. Imagery resulting from collection can be digitally disseminated to the force imagery interpretation unit tactical exploitation group for exploitation, printing, and dissemination.
Electronic reconnaissance and warfare.
Aerial electronic reconnaissance and electronic warfare is conducted using EA-6B aircraft. EA-6B aircraft also process and disseminate information from digital tape recordings obtained during electronic warfare missions to update and maintain enemy electronic order of battle information. The sensors are passive systems that require threat emitters to be active to collect.
Combat Service Support Element.
As the CSSE is often in more direct contact with the indigenous population, it can collect HUMINT unavailable to the other MAGTF elements. For example, medical battalion personnel can often provide information on health conditions and their potential impact on operations. The CSSE is limited in its reconnaissance capabilities, having no dedicated reconnaissance capabilities. However, it can conduct road and route reconnaissance with its convoys, and military police.
Combat engineers are excellent sources of information. These engineer units often conduct Engineer reconnaissance of an area and can provide detailed reporting on lines of communications; i.e., roads, rivers, railroad lines, bridges, and obstacles to maneuver.
Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsman.
The Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen are Navy combat medics, active members of a division or force recon platoons, that are trained in every aspect in the Marine Corps reconnaissance community. They provide advanced life support skills to casualties that are associated in underwater diving and parachute injuries, and hazards of the maritime and amphibious environments. The independent duty corpsmen (IDC) are assigned to the independently operated FMF Reconnaissance (Force Recon) companies, as the "Special" Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen ("SARCs").
National and theater assets.
The MAGTF can draw on the full range of national, theater, joint, other service, and allied reconnaissance assets. When made available, these capabilities will be fully integrated into MAGTF reconnaissance operations; e.g., Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), Navy SEALS or Army signals intelligence aircraft. During forcible entry operations, the MAGTF integrates its amphibious reconnaissance capabilities with national, theater, and special operating forces.
The Marine Corps component will support the MAGTF by monitoring the status of MAGTF reconnaissance requests to national and theater entities. The component coordinates the provision of Marine intelligence liaison to the joint task force and other component intelligence elements to satisfy the MAGTF’s requirements. Some MAGTF reconnaissance assets, such as the radio battalion and the CI/HUMINT company, will usually have direct connectivity with appropriate external agencies to coordinate tasking or support.

John David Carson

John David Carson (March 6, 1952 - October 27, 2009) was an American actor. He was born in North Hollywood, California. Carson began his career at a young age, acting in television advertisements, and later doing cartoon voice-acting for Hanna-Barbera. He attended Los Angeles Valley College where he played a lead role in their 1969 production of The Taming Of The Shrew. Upon beginning his Hollywood career he was immediately engaged in a dispute with Johnny Carson over the use of their shared name - he subsequently went by his full name, "John David Carson." He appeared in many B-movies and television shows throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
Film career.
Carson's first feature film was "Pretty Maids All in a Row" in 1971, a sex comedy set in a high school, also featuring Rock Hudson. Carson portrayed "Ponce de Leon Harper", a nerdy and sexually inexperienced young man who is tormented with lust at the pretty young women around him at school and suffers from chronic priapism. Ponce is eventually "mentored" by his guidance counselor, played by Hudson, an expert at seducing younger women, who takes him under his wing and persuades an attractive female teacher to sleep with him. This film was directed by Roger Vadim and the screenplay was written by Gene Roddenberry of "Star Trek" fame. Besides Hudson, the cast also included Telly Savalas, Angie Dickinson, Roddy McDowall and James Doohan – by all rights, an "all-star" cast both behind and in front of the camera. Nevertheless this was an anomaly of Carson's career, and he was thereafter relegated mostly to background roles despite his standout performance.
Aside from "Pretty Maids All in a Row", Carson's most notable role was in the 1976 film "Stay Hungry", alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jeff Bridges and Sally Field. He portrayed the notorious troublemaker "Halsey", whose obnoxious antics and mockery of Joe Santo (Schwarzenegger) touch off one of the primary conflicts of the film.
Carson appeared in a great deal of television productions, including "Hawaii Five-O" and "Charlie's Angels", typically playing bit parts. He portrayed "Jay Spence" on "Falcon Crest", a prime-time soap opera. He played "Larry Burns", a television repairman who is framed for a woman's murder by a corrupt sheriff, on "Murder She Wrote" and an Irish jockey named "Kevin Ryan" on "Charlie's Angels". He appeared in various B-movies such as "Empire of the Ants" – an adaptation of an H. G. Wells story about gigantic, man-eating ants – and "The Creature from Black Lake", and acted alongside George C. Scott in "The Day of the Dolphin". He again appeared opposite Scott, playing his character's son, in "The Savage is Loose". Carson continued acting in small parts up until 1990, appearing in the Julia Roberts hit "Pretty Woman", which marked his very last appearance on film. He voluntarily retired from acting after this role.
He wrote a screenplay while living in Las Vegas, which was semi-autobiographical and reflected the trials and experiences of his life as an actor. George C. Scott was to be featured in it, though the character representing Carson would be played by a young, "unknown" actor with the same background as himself. Scott, who was close with Carson, was to help produce the screenplay; after Scott's death, the plans for production were abandoned. The current whereabouts of the screenplay are not known.
Personal life.
Carson was the son of Western actor Aldrich "Kit" Carson and Rosamonde "Boots" James Carson, a fashion model, and was of Irish and Cherokee ancestry. He entered Hollywood from a theater background; at the time of his arrival on the motion-picture scene, he had already undergone several traumatic incidents. His parents had split up; furthermore, he had been involved in a serious motorcycle accident which left him almost completely deaf in his left ear, according to an interview in "Interview Magazine". At only 17 years old, Carson was quite overwhelmed by these personal issues and by the pressure he felt in his acting career. He turned to LSD to attempt to gain some self-realization. By his own admission, "it provided a catharsis" for him, but also left him frequently confused.
In this same interview he complained of sexual advances towards him by male directors of films and theater productions. In his own words - "I don't care about anybody's sexual preferences - I really don't; I wouldn't want anyone to object to my sexual preferences. But when it's forced on you, for reasons of personal gain - when they say it's going to be the end of your career if you don't comply with their wishes - I think it's low, it's cheap." Carson attributed some of his lack of success in theater to this issue.
Carson was raised as a Christian Scientist, which he claimed to still practice on a day to day basis. In the interview he also expressed an interest in Scientology and astrology.
He was passionate about acting, but decided to retire from the business, citing his desire not to be "a pawn in Hollywood."
Carson was romantically involved with actress Kim Darby. He was also briefly married to model Vicki Morgan, who was later murdered in a very high-profile case, from 1976 to 1977.
He died on October 27, 2009 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was survived by his long-time girlfriend and wife of 3 years, Diana Carson, and their daughter.

Frank Schulze (born March 31, 1970) is a German former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Schulze played as a youth for his hometown club, Stahl Riesa, before joining Dynamo Dresden at age 11. He eventually made it through to the first-team, and made three league appearances in the 1989–90 season as third choice 'keeper (behind Thomas Köhler and Ronny Teuber) as Dynamo won the DDR-Oberliga. He also played in the East German Cup final, a 3–0 win over Dynamo Schwerin which completed the double for Dresden.
Schulze spent the 1990–91 season on loan at Viktoria Frankfurt (Oder), and made 20 appearances as the side finished bottom of the NOFV-Oberliga. The league, which had been renamed after German reunification, was used to decide how East German teams would be placed in the unified league system, and Frankfurt's position saw them remain in the NOFV-Oberliga, which would now be at the third tier. Schulze returned to Dynamo Dresden, who had qualified for the Bundesliga, where he spent three years without making an appearance, before retiring in 1994.
Internationally, Schulze played for East Germany at youth level, and was considered for the Olympic team's qualification campaign for the 1992 tournament, before reunification brought an end to it. Following this, he won one cap for the Germany under-21 team in 1990.

Silk Engineering

Silk Engineering was a British motorcycle manufacturer established by George Silk and Maurice Patey and based at Darley Abbey, Derbyshire. They produced Silk 700S two-stroke motorcycles until 1979. Problems with spare parts and rising costs led to the company ceasing manufacture.
History.
Silk was founded in the late 1960s by George Silk, a Scott motorcycle enthusiast who worked for Derbyshire Scott specialist Tom Ward. George Silk developed a racing motorcycle by fitting a Scott engine into a Spondon frame. Following some success with a Silk Special at the Barbon Hill Climb in 1970, Silk began planning a road-going prototype with his business partner Maurice Patey. They set up Silk Engineering and began providing a spares and repair service for Scott motorcycle owners. They also offered a range of modifications to improve the reliability and performance of Scotts, as well as improving the lubrication and gas flow. Silk exhibited the prototype at the Racing and Sporting Motorcycle Show in London in 1971. Orders exceeded his capability to produce them but he hand-built 21 Silk-Scott Specials between 1971 and 1975. The supply of Scott engines was limited, therefore customers were asked to find their own.
Matt Holder, who had bought the rights to the Scott engines, disputed the use of the Scott trademark and prevented Silk from making Scott engines under licence, forcing Silk to develop his own. A new two stroke engine was developed by David Midgelow (from Rolls Royce engineering) and George Silk, and they had assistance from two-stroke expert Gordon Blair of Queen’s University, Belfast, who optimised the porting with the aid of specialist computer programs.
The Silk 700S.
The Silk 700S was launched in 1975 and featured the new engine in a specially designed steel tubular frame made by Spondon Engineering of Derbyshire, who also made the forks, yolks, disc/drum brakes and rotors. Priced at £1,355 it was the most expensive production motorcycle of the time. The 700S continued to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes – British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a "Scott special edition" in purple and cream – and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.
The "thermo-syphon" cooling system boiled water using engine heat, then fed it back from the radiator in a rubber tube to the engine cases, where it boiled again, removing the need for a water pump. 
The Silk Engineering company was taken over by the Kendal-based Furmanite International Group in 1976 who continued production of the Silk 700S and in 1977 it was upgraded to the 700S Mk2, which Silk called the "Sabre". Improvements from the Mk 1 included finned cylinder barrels, a redesigned seat, instruments and rear light nacelle. Porting and timing revisions plus a higher compression boosted power to a more respectable 48 hp, but the price continued to rise. In 1978 the 100th Silk motorcycle was produced and production continued until December 1979 when Silk realised they were losing £200 with every motorcycle sold.
Silk 500.
The last Silk motorcycle ever built was Clive Worrell's 500 cc model based on a prototype that was never produced. It was used as a competition prize for Classic Bike magazine.
Silk 350.
The Silk 350 was a two-stroke Trials prototype that was developed but never made it into production.

Season expectations were very high with Perth Glory's owner Tony Sage allowing manager David Mitchell to sign High calibre players like former Bolton defender Andy Todd and former Ajax midfielder Viktor Sikora who was on loan to Perth from FC Dallas the previous season. The club also managed to secure Socceroos Jacob Burns, Mile Sterjovski and Chris Coyne. Both Sage and Mitchell's intentions were to restore Perth's footballing past and challenge for an A-League finals spot. At one stage of the campaign the Glory were pushing to claim top spot and the league but a run of poor form and injuries cost the team and only managed to hold onto their final league position of 5th which equalled their best A-League finish in 2005–2006.
Perth Glory were knocked out of the A-League finals when they took part in a 1–1 draw against the Wellington Phoenix in Wellington which they lost to penalties and thus ended Perth's best season of the A-League so far.

Jakub Szela

Jakub Szela (was born 1787, Smarżowa, in Galicia - died 1862 or 1866, Vicşani, in Bukovina, now Romania) was a Polish leader of a pro-Austrian peasant uprising against the Polish gentry in Galicia in 1846; directed against manorial property and oppression (for example, the manorial prisons) and rising against serfdom; scores of manors were attacked and their inhabitants murdered. Galician, mainly Polish, peasants killed over 1000 noblemen and destroyed 474 manors in 1846. 
He represented his village in an extended conflict with its unjust lord and was arrested and lashed several times. During the 1846 rebellion, instigated by Vienna, Szela became the leader of the Galician peasants, destroyed a number of manors, and killed, among others, the family of his lord, though he is reported to have saved the children. Szela tried to organize an all-Galician peasant uprising, with the main slogan of corvee refusal. The rebellious villages were pacified by the Austrian Army. After pacification of the rebellious villages by the Austrian Army, Szela was briefly arrested, and then resettled to Bukovina, where he was given a land grant by the Austrian government in Bukovina. He is also said to have received a medal from the Austrian government, an event reported as fact by Magosci et al. but played down as only a "Polish rumor" by Wolff.
Szela was portrayed sympathetically by Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, a Czech-born Austrian writer who had serfs before 1848, in her short story “Jakob Szela” in Dorf- und Schlossgeschichten (1883). The massacre of the gentry in 1846 was the historical memory that haunted Stanisław Wyspiański's play "The Wedding". He was also featured in a recent Monika Strzępka and Paweł Demirski’s play “In the Name of Jakub S.”.

The Lads

The Lads are a New Zealand Christian rock/pop group that was formed in 1993. In early 2005 the band moved from New Zealand to Nashville, Tennessee.
History.
The Lads are an American-based New Zealand band that has been active since the late 1990s. The band has played at many church services, youth events, camps and high schools around Australia and New Zealand. Before moving to America, The Lads were a popular act at Parachute Music Festival and performed at each festival, except for 2006, up until 2007. In August 2010, The Lads confirmed via Facebook that they would return to New Zealand for Parachute 2011. It would be their first New Zealand concert in four years. In addition to live tours across the United States, the Lads also produce a TV show which is shown on TV stations around the world.
The founding members of The Lads are: Mark Millard (vocals/trombone/saxophone/drums), Steve King (drums/vocals), Chris White (keyboards/trumpet/vocals), Bennett "Ben" Knowles (bass/vocals) and Paul Cotton (guitar/vocals). The founding members were friends as children, growing up together at the same church - Wellington South Salvation Army - in Wellington, New Zealand. All of the founding members except Paul were born and raised in New Zealand. Paul was born in Canada but moved with his family to New Zealand at the age of 12. As such, he speaks with a Canadian accent. He is also the older brother of TrueBliss singer Joe Cotton. 
The band members started out writing songs for fun and became known as "Lads." This quickly changed with the success of their second album, Arbor Day. The Lads had a string of number one hits on Christian radio in Australia and New Zealand, and were invited to headline all of the major Christian festivals throughout New Zealand and Australia. During these early performances, the band had no dedicated lead vocalist. Instead, all members except Paul shared the job. Mark became the primary lead vocalist by the time Lost @ Sea was released. Chris and Ben covered lead vocals occasionally. Most notably, Ben sings the song "Understand" from the Lost @ Sea album - a song which gained huge radio airplay in New Zealand and was later featured on TV show Dawson's Creek. The song "Alone" was also featured. 
In 2000, The Lads' album Lost @ Sea was named best gospel album at the New Zealand music awards, and their 2002 album Marvel followed suit, taking the prize again. 
Before the band recorded the album "Marvel" in 2001, Paul Cotton left the group to pursue a teaching career. He did, however, have some input on the writing of some of the songs on that album. Rimu Tahu from the band Royal Rumble temporarily filled in as live guitarist, but Paul's permanent replacemant was Matt Chapman, who only appeared on the album Marvel and later developed RSI and was replaced by Bjorn Brickell in late 2013. 
After the band's self-titled fifth album, The Lads their focus began to shift towards a younger age group. Their aim, after a few trips to the USA to tour, was to try and break into a larger market by moving to the U.S. in 2005. It was during this time that Chris and Bennett decided to leave the band and move back to New Zealand. Bjorn's older brother Kristian filled in on bass for early performances after the move to the U.S. but has not been formerly replaced since his departure. Instead, the band uses loops and backtracks to fill in instruments vacated by former members. Kristian now plays in a new version of Royal Rumble along with Rimu Tahu. Chris continues to have some creative and lyrical input into the band and can be seen on live footage filmed in New Zealand from the "Live at The Thunderdome" DVD. Paul has also had guest slots during performances in the band's home city of Wellington, New Zealand during tours in New Zealand.
Bjorn left the band in 2010 to pursue music with his wife Tara but can still be seen in cartoon form on promotional material and on videos displayed during live shows. He was replaced by Tim Smith. Tim can be seen on the "Live at Thunderdome" DVD and on Season 2 of "The Lads" TV show but has since left the band and returned to New Zealand. To date, he has not been formally replaced.
Christianity.
The Lads are a band made up of Christians, writing both songs of praise and worship as well as contemporary music.
Current Band Status.
Steve and Mark live in Nashville and tour on a regular basis, usually for no more than two weeks at a time. In November 2012, they were in Australia, and in December 2012, they toured some of New Zealand. Among their stops were a Christmas Concert in the rural Southland township of Winton. The band was back in NZ for the Parachute Music Festival at the end of January 2013.
Discography.
§Only 2000 tapes were ever made of P.I.R.A.W and is somewhat of a collectors item for fans.
DVDs.
In 2005, the band released a live DVD called "Alive in Brisbane".
In 2011, the band released "Live at The Thunderdome" a Lads TV special DVD with an extended episode intermixed with live performances from their 2011 Parachute Music Festival performance in New Zealand

At the entrance of the village is the church of St Nicholas which was built around 1960, where originally stood the smaller church of St Nicholas which was built in 1870. Geliniatika village was settled a few years before the 1821 Revolution, by residents from the nearby mountainous Gelini, who would come down towards the coast with their herds to pass the winter, or to find work from the Turkish settlers. 
Later, the village was used as a place to pass the winter by the residents of the higher up Spartineika community and few residents of the Lagkadeika community. Nowadays all of Geliniatika's residents are permanent and few go up to Spartineika for the summer. 
Primary school students were first taught from 1845-1855 in various homes of the village. In 1900 the first primary school was built; however in 1935 it was demolished. The building of the current primary school commenced in 1932 with the help of the then Education Minister P. Petridis and was completed in November 1935, at the time of Prime Minister Panagis Tsardaris. 
Today, the local committee representing the village in the Xylokastro Council consists of: Dimitrios Douvis, Sofia Metzelou, Basileios Giannopoulos, Dimitris Mentzelos and Christos Kordalis.

Ecklonia maxima, sea bamboo, is a species of kelp native to the southern oceans. It is most typically found along the southern Atlantic coast of Africa, from the very south of South Africa north to Namibia. In these areas the species dominates the shallow, (up to 8 m) temperate-water kelp forests offshore. 
From the holdfast attached to a rock or the large holdfast of another kelp, a single long stipe rises to the surface waters, where a single large pneumatocyst holds a tangle of blades at the surface. 
The species is of economic importance: it is harvested for both an agricultural supplement and as food for abalone raised on farms.

Sangalhos

Sangalhos is a town and a civil parish in the municipality of Anadia, Portugal, with an area of 16.90 km² and population of 4350 habitantes (2001).
History.
Archaeological remnants dating back to the Roman era presuppose a minor community within the territory of Sangalhos. The pre-Roman peoples of the region of the Vouga was already a mixture of races and cultures from the northern Europe and Mediterranean, but principally of Celtic or Turduli. The origin of its name "sangalhos", which refers to a unit of measure, as hypothesized by Joaquim de Silveira, came from the cult of São Galo (Sanctus Gallus). The author placed the origin of its parish in the 7th century, during the Visigothic period. During the Roman era, the area was part of the Roman civitas Talabriga (Marnel, Lamas do Vouga). 
The first documents that refer to Sangalhos date back to 957 A.D., and progress until the founding of the Portuguese Kingdom. In 1064, with the conquest of Coimbra, the lands of the Bairrada were liberated from the Moors. The hamlet of Sangalhos, appropriated by Count Sesnando, first and illustrious governor of Coimbra, was donated to the Church (and Hospital) of Mirleos, founded in the city of Mondego. But, by 1220-1221, during the administrative inqueries, Sangalhos and its parish Church of São Vicente, had already passed into the hands of the Crown. During this era, the parish consisted of two metropoles: its seat, Sangalhos do Paço ("et alio Sancto Galios"), and Sangalhos da Igreja ("Sancto Galios"), in addition to the localities of Saima, Sá, Casal da Rua and Avelãs de Caminho
The great monasteries of Lorvão, Vacariça, and Santa Clara de Coimbra dominated the activities in the region of the Bairrada. Santa Clara de Coimbra, founded by nun Mor Dias at the beginning of the 14th century, in who the patronage and lands of Sangalhos was entrusted after 1338. The first years were turbulent for the nun, who although a nun in the Order of the Holy Cross, was not supported by royal and Crusader donations. The intervention of Queen Elizabeth of Aragon, assisted resolving these disputes, and provided the authorization to build a new monastery in the name of Santa Clara and Santa Isabel.
In the 12th and 13th century, Sangalhos was one of the principal towns in the region, along with Horta (Tamengos), Recardães and Óis da Ribeira. It was selected by Afonso Henriques to be a test area for the use of the alqueire unit of measure in the distribution and productivity of lands. The alqueire, equivalent to Roman (8.733 litres), was adopted by the King around 1179, the same year that forals were bestowed on Coimbra, Santarém and Lisbon. In the archbishopric of Vouga and bishopric of Oporto, the Henriquino alqueire began to be referred to as the "Sangalhos", "sangalhês" or "sangalho". It was only in the 16th century, that this unit of measure fell into disuse, during King Manuel I of Portugal's reforms (although the reference continued to be used by many rural farmers).
In 1320, the church of São Vicente de Sangalhos was the most active church in the Bairrada and Baixo Vouga region.
Until the Middle Ages it was the municipal seat of its own territory (its foral was officially conferred in 1514 by King Manuel I of Portugal, during the King's administrative reorganization), although Avelãs do Caminho continued be a religious dependency of Sangalhos until the 19th century. By 1338, the land in Sangalhos was donated to the monastery of Santa Clara de Coimbra. This institution, which possessed the land during the next 500 years, was the primary motivator for settlement. As a result, Amoreira da Gândara, Fogueira, Paraimo and São João, all mentioned in the Manuelino foral, were increasingly active hamlets. As a component of the larger Archdiocese of Vouga, it was ruled by the Bishop of Coimbra, until it was later incorporated into Diocese of Aveiro (1774). By 1623, the monastery of Santa Clara de Coimbra received rents from 300 families and individuals working those lands; an area that included 2000 ha of semi-forested lands. By 1720, those rents had been significant enough to allow the construction of new chapel to the church through only one year's rents.
When Sangalhos reverted to a civil parish in the 16th century, it was incorporated into the burgh of Vouga, that also pertained to the municipality of Marnel, thus integrating Sangalhos into the comarca of Aveiro. Sangelhos became a regional military outpost, whose territory included many of the local parishes of the modern municipalities of Anadia, Oliveira do Bairro and Águeda. Divided in four companies, it was one of the more extensive military Captaincies of the region.
After the Liberal Wars (1820–1835), the donation to the monastery of Santa Clara de Coimbra was annulled and the municipalities of Sangalhos and Avelãs do Caminho (which became an independent parish within Anadia) became extinct. Similarly, the military Captaincy of Sangalhos was discontinued and Sangalhos became integrated into the municipality of Oliveira do Bairro, later São Lourenço do Bairro and, finally (1853), within the municipality of Anadia. As such, although geographically close to the neighboring city of Oliveira do Bairro, the parish was integrated into Anadia. By 1928, Amoreira da Gândara separated from Sangalhos to form a new parish.
Although the parish lost much of its politico-administrative importance, Sangalhos until the 20th century, prospered. Its habitants built many prosperous businesses that influenced the growth and development of the community, including pioneering bicycle production in Portugal and ceramics industry. Consequently, Sangalhos returned to the status of town in 1985 (Decrete-Law 65/85, 25 September).
Geography.
Sangalhos is situated along a summit that overlooks the valley of the Cértima River, an area of ample vistas and vegetation that extends to the south towards Buçaco and east towards the summit of Caramulo (Caramulinho), known by locals as the "Cesto Poceiro". Its central urban area is located 7.5 kilometres from the municipal seat of Anadia, and 24 kilometres southwest of the district capital (Aveiro). It is surrounded by the municipality and parish of Oliveira do Bairro, as well as Aguada de Baixo (in the municiaplity of Águeda), and its municipal neighbors Amoreira da Gândara, Mogofores, Ancas, Avelãs de Cima, Avelãs de Caminho, Paredes do Bairro, Arcos and São Lourenço do Bairro in the municipality of Anadia.

Ounalashka Corporation

The Ounalashka Corporation is the native village corporation for the Aleuts of Unalaska and Amaknak Islands, in the Aleutian Islands. Like its parent entity, the Aleut Corporation, it was formed as a result of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. Its headquarters are located in Unalaska, Alaska.
The Ounalashka Corporation has a significantly greater control over the economy and development of Unalaska than do many of the other village corporations in Alaska, due to the severely limited amount of land suitable for development on the island, and the high percentage of that land that the corporation owns. To maintain that control, the Corporation has a policy of never selling any portion of its land, though it does issue leases for as long as 50 years. Since consolidating its holdings in the late 1970s, it has become nearly impossible to plan any new development in Unalaska without authorization of the Corporation.

Sir Robert Fowler, 1st Baronet

Sir Robert Nicholas Fowler, 1st Baronet DL JP (12 September 1828, Tottenham, Middlesex – 22 May 1891 Harley Street, London) was an MP and Lord Mayor of London.
He was born the son of Thomas Fowler of Gastard, Wiltshire. He attended Grove House School, Tottenham and London University where he was awarded a B.A. degree in 1848.
He was a banker and M.P. for the Penryn and Falmouth Constituency, (1868–1874) and Conservative M.P. for the City of London Constituency (1880–1891). He was also elected Sheriff of the City of London for 1880 and Lord Mayor of London in 1883 and 1885, the last Lord Mayor to serve multiple terms. He was created a baronet in 1885.
He was the author of "A visit to Japan, China and India".
According to Frank Harris, an admittedly unreliable source, Fowler excited the disgust of his fellow guests at a dinner given by William Thackeray Marriott by breaking wind copiously, and being apparently unconscious of giving offence.
In 1890, Fowler was described as "of Gastard, Wilts., a JP and DL for Middlesex and Wilts, an Alderman of London".
Marriage and family.
On 27 October 1852, Robert Nicholas Fowler married Sarah Charlotte Fox: she was the daughter of Sarah and Alfred Fox, of Falmouth, born on 15 March 1834.
They had ten daughters and one son:

Gemella

Gemella is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that thrive best at high partial pressure of CO2.
Description.
They are faculatively anaerobic and give negative reactions to both oxidase and catalase tests. They are obligately fermentative, producing either a mixture of acetic and lactic acids or an equimolar molar mixture of acetic acid and CO2. For example, "G. haemolysans" ferments glucose forming a mixture of acetic and lactic acids in the absence of oxygen, whereas when oxygen is present, it forms acetic acid and CO2.
Clinical importance.
"Gemella" bacteria are primarily found in the mucous membranes of humans and other animals, particularly in the oral cavity and upper digestive tract. "Gemella haemolysans" has been found to be involved in pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients.

Bare Bones (novel)

Bare Bones is the sixth novel by Kathy Reichs starring forensic anthropologist, Temperance Brennan.
Plot.
In the Charlotte summer heat, Brennan is hoping to get away for a few days at the beach with her would-be lover, Detective Andrew Ryan. First she has to identify the skeleton of a newborn baby found in a wood stove; the baby was probably born to the missing daughter of a former work colleague. Then a small plane flies into a rock face; the occupants may have been drug running. A picnic at Cowans Ford with Brennan's daughter Katy turns sour when her estranged husband's dog Boyd discovers mixed animal and human bones in a derelict outhouse. Is the headless body found in South Carolina linked, and who is sending Brennan e-mails telling her to back-off ? More puzzling, the drug runners and the animal (bear and rare bird) bones seem to be connected in a blatant CITES violation - the market for CITES animals and parts thereof being as hot as the drug market. Brennan, helped by Ryan and Detective "Skinny" Slidell, must try and piece together these seemingly random events and discover who is behind the racket.

E14 munition

The E14 munition was a cardboard sub-munition (air-dropped or ground-launched munitions that eject smaller submunitions) developed by the United States biological weapons program as an anti-crop weapon. In 1955 the E14 was used in a series of field tests, during the tests the munition was loaded with fleas and air-dropped.
History.
The E14 munition was developed by the United States for use in its offensive biological warfare arsenal as an anti-crop weapon. After the Korean War U.S. interest in large-scale entomological warfare increased. The E14 was one of two sub-munitions used in large-scale testing aimed at learning the feasibility and result of an air-dropped insect attack. 
In September 1954, at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, the E14 was again used in a series of tests known as "Operation Big Itch". During Big Itch, uninfected rat fleas ("Xenopsylla cheopis") were loaded into the E14 and air-dropped over the proving ground.
The E14 used cardboard and sponge inserts to hold the fleas inside the cardboard container. With the sponge inserts in place, the E14 could hold about 100,000 fleas. Eighty cardboard inserts, or "loop tubes", could be carried in the E14 as well. The munition could hold 80 loop tubes, each one capable of holding 3,000 fleas. The testing in Utah was ultimately successful.
In May 1955 the U.S. utilized the E14 in field test, this time in the U.S. state of Georgia. The E14 was packed with "aircomb waffles" or loop tubes, instead of fleas these tests used uninfected yellow fever mosquitoes ("Aedes aegypti"). The successful Georgia trials were known as "Operation Big Buzz".
Specifications.
The E14 munition was a sub-munition that can be clustered in the E86 cluster bomb. It was a long, wide cardboard container. Internally the bomb contained an actuator, which emitted carbon dioxide, a piston that would expel the bomb's contents, and a small parachute, to be deployed when the weapon was dropped from the E86 cluster bomb. The weapons were designed to release their payload of biological agent, be it a vector or anti-crop agent, at above the ground, after it was released from the cluster munition.

Lazare Saminsky

Lazare Saminsky, born Lazar Iosifovich Saminsky (; Valegozulovo, near Odessa, 27 October 1882 – Port Chester, New York, 30 June 1959), was a performer, conductor and composer, especially of Jewish music.
Life.
Born to a merchant family, Saminsky received a broad education in the arts, sciences and languages. He studied music at the Odessa conservatoire from 1903–1905, and then went to Moscow where he studied mathematics and philosophy as well as music. Expelled for his participation in student protests, he went to St.Petersburg where he studied with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Anatoly Lyadov and Nikolai Tcherepnin.
Whilst still a student he became a founder member, with Mikhail Gnesin and others, of the 'Society for Jewish Folk Music'. He wrote music for the Society and helped organise its earliest publication. He continued an active member, even though from 1911 to 1918 he lived in Tiflis, where he also interested himself in Georgian and Armenian music, and from 1917 to 1918 he was head of the Conservatoire. During this period he also wrote an opera "Tsar Yulian (Emperor Julian)" (which he later destroyed), and researched Jewish music of the Caucasian region. He was particularly interested in styles of cantillation ("nigun").
In 1919 Saminky left the Soviet Union and travelled to France and England, where he gave recitals of Russian and Jewish music, and led a ballet season at the Duke of York's Theatre in London, where he married the English poetess, Lillian Morgan. In December 1920 he left to settle in the USA, where he was active as a composer, conductor and organiser of musical events. In 1922 he became a board member of the International Composers Guild. From 1924 he was music director of the Temple Emanu-El
Saminsky's major compositions include the 'First and Second Hebrew Song Cycles' opp. 12 and 13 (written in 1914, published New York, 1922, text in Yiddish), songs, choral works and piano pieces.
Saminsky wrote numerous books on Jewish music, contemporary music and conducting.

Leges Edwardi Confessoris

The title "Leges Edwardi Confessoris" "Laws of Edward the Confessor" refers to an early twelfth-century English collection of 39 laws ("c". 1140). 
Historical value.
The value of the compilation for our understanding of English law, both before and after the Conquest, needs to be sought elsewhere. The most recent editor, Bruce O'Brien, argues that what the work offers instead are "apparently original observations of and comments on the English law of the author's day." The primary concerns of the text lay with the king's peace and the peace of the Holy Church, especially in the North Midlands and Yorkshire region bordering on the Danelaw. Although the emphasis is on common law, the same text shows that there were regional differences. 
Article 12 presents a number of specific situations under which the king’s protection or peace ("mund" in Old English codes) could be established:
Other points of interest include references to the wapentake, the reeve of the riding, Peter's Pence, murder fines ("murdrum"), consciousness about England’s Saxon heritage, and the legal position of Jews in England.
Influence.
Aided by the Confessor’s legendary status as lawgiver, the compilation enjoyed considerable interest in medieval England. The text is found in a large number of manuscripts. Four recensions have been distinguished, two of which are revisions with additional material being grafted on to the core of the text. 
A version of the "Leges Edwardi Confessoris" was known to Henry de Bracton and to the barons and jurists responsible for the Magna Carta.

Andy Brownrigg

Andrew David Brownrigg (born 2 August 1976) is an English former professional footballer.
Football career.
Brownrigg began his career as a trainee with Hereford United, making his début during the 1994–95 season. In March 1995, after just eight league games for the Bulls, he was transferred to Norwich City for a fee of £100,000. He spent part of the following season on loan to Kettering Town and in August 1997 moved to Rotherham United having failed to make a first team appearance for Norwich, despite being an unused sub in the Premier League game against Arsenal at Highbury on 1 April 1995.
After being on the bench against Cambridge Utd during Rotherham United's opening game of the 2007–08 season, Brownrigg was attacked by a youth with a hammer and suffered serious facial injuries. Because of his injuries Brownrigg missed a large portion of the season and this significantly hindered his chances at Rotherham United. He joined Stalybridge Celtic on loan in March 1998 to get match fitness, and was released by Rotherham at the end of the season. 
Brownrigg then joined Yeovil Town, but left for personal reasons and by November 1998 was again playing for Stalybridge Celtic. It was reported that Brownrigg would be signing for Tamworth that December, but this did not transpire so he, instead, signed for Stocksbridge Park Steels.
In July 1999, Brownrigg signed for Kidderminster Harriers and helped them to the Football Conference title, and with it promotion to the Football League. On 21 July 2000 Brownrigg was transferred to Scottish side Greenock Morton, costing £26,500. It later transpired that Morton was in turmoil off the field, with claims that they had failed to pay Kidderminster the fee for Brownrigg. By October 2000, Brownrigg was staying away from Morton claiming that the club also owed him money. The result was that Brownrigg played just three first team games before leaving in March 2001, joining Hartlepool United, although he was released in May 2001 having failed to break into the Hartlepool side.
He was linked with a return to Kidderminster, but in June 2001 joined Northwich Victoria. He subsequently moved to Hednesford Town later that year and moved to Gainsborough Trinity in June 2002. He was released in September 2002 and joined Wakefield & Emley. He had a trial with Worksop Town in the 2003 close season and also had a trial with Oxford United in November the same year. He joined Maltby Main, but left to join Ossett Albion. He then rejoined Maltby Main in January 2004 and signed for Conference side Scarborough in March 2004, but decided to leave the club the following month and rejoined Maltby Main for the final promotion push at the end of the season.
He subsequently joined Hallam in 2005,but left to join Buxton in the same year. He was virtually ever-present the following season when the Bucks won the NCEL Premier League title, and was extremely popular with the supporters at the Silverlands who adapted the 'Arthur Brownlow' song of Stockport County in his honour. He left Buxton in July 2006 because of travelling difficulties and the fact that he was about to embark on a Sports degree at University. He joined Sheffield FC in the close season of 2006. During that season, Brownrigg played a starring role in Sheffield's promotion from the NCEL Premier League, making it back to back promotions from the NCEL Premier League for him. At the end the season Brownrigg left Sheffield, and rejoined Hallam in November 2007.
In December 2008, he moved from Hallam to Staveley MW. In September 2009, Brownrigg left Staveley Miners Welfare to rejoin Hallam.
In March 2010, Brownrigg re-signed for Ossett Albion in the Northern Premier League for the purpose of fitness for a proposed move to Worksop Town FC. Andy signed for Worksop Town in the NPL Premier Division, after playing three games for Ossett.
At the beginning of the 2010–11 season Brownrigg signed for AFC Emley in the Northern Counties East League Division 1.
Personal life.
On 16 June 2008 Brownrigg was admitted to Sporting Chance, a recovery clinic set up by former England International Tony Adams MBE for sportsmen and women. During his time in the clinic Brownrigg was treated for addictive-related problems. Subsequently, on 11 June 2008, and thanks to a successful period of rehabilitation, Brownrigg returned home to Sheffield where, to this day, he remains in recovery.
Education and research.
On 16 July 2009, Brownrigg graduated with a First Class Honours Degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology at The University of Huddersfield. In recognition of his achievements and research area, the University offered Brownrigg a PhD Scholarship in 2009.
Brownrigg’s research interests lie within the area of transition, with a specific focus on the experiences of professional footballers' during sporting exit/career transition.
In October 2012, Brownrigg's research gained recognition by The British Psychological Society when his work was published in the Qualitative Methods in Psychology, 'Sports and Performance' Bulletin.

Peter J. Stadelman

Peter John Stadelman (October 29, 1871 – January 10, 1954) was an American businessman and politician from the state of Oregon. A native of New York, he was raised in The Dalles, Oregon, where he was a prominent businessman and mayor. A Republican, he served as Oregon Secretary of State during The Great Depression and later in the Oregon State Senate.
Early life.
Peter Stadelman was born in Hempstead, New York, on October 29, 1871, to an Austrian immigrant and native New Yorker. His father, Joseph, immigrated to the United States in 1869, where he married Mary Rath. He was raised near The Dalles along the Columbia River at the family’s farm, which once belonged to the Catholic Mission. Stadelman received his education at the public schools in The Dalles before starting work as a paper delivery boy for "The Oregonian", and then as an assistant at the local post office.
In 1893, Stadelman began working in the ice and fruit business, which led him to start his own company in 1898, the Stadelman Fruit and Ice Company. He was married in 1904 to Mary Kelly Hicks, and they would have two sons, Wilbur and George Peter. Stadelman purchased the family farm with his brother in 1907 from their father. In 1920, he was a founder of the Citizen’s National Bank in that city, and would later serve as the president of the bank.
Political career.
Stadelman first entered politics as a city councilor in The Dalles, serving from 1908 to 1914. In 1918, he became the mayor of the city and remained in office until 1928.

Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company

The Maxim-Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company was the result of a takeover by Hiram Maxim of Thorsten Nordenfelt's Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company in 1888.
History.
The company produced a range of light artillery, machine guns and ammunition.
It was the subject of one of history's most famous court cases in 1894, Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co, in which Nordenfelt successfully claimed that the takeover condition preventing him from competing with Maxim for 25 years "in any way" was an unreasonable restraint of trade, but failed to overturn the main condition preventing Nordenfelt from competing with Maxim in the guns and ammunition trade for 25 years.
The company competed against the Armstrong subsidiary Elswick Ordnance Company's range of armaments, which included Hotchkiss guns made under licence.
The company became part of the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, which was taken over by Vickers, Sons and Company in 1897 to form Vickers, Sons & Maxim. This gave Vickers a complete naval shipbuilding, engineering and armaments capability, an advantage Armstrongs had held for many years, and eventually allowed Vickers to take over Armstrongs.

1947 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race

The 1947 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, was the 3rd annual running of the "blue water classic" Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.
The 1947 edition was once again hosted by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia based in Sydney, New South Wales. As with the previous two Sydney to Hobart Yacht Races, the 1947 edition began on Sydney Harbour, at noon on Boxing Day (26 December 1947), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170 km) through the Tasman Sea, past Bass Strait, into Storm Bay and up the River Derwent, to cross the finish line in Hobart, Tasmania.
The 1947 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race involved a fleet of 28 competitors. The first edition, the 1945 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race had initially been intended to be conducted as a pleasure cruise, but by the 1947 edition, the competitiveness of the event had been well and truly set.
"Morna", skippered by Claude Plowman won line honours in a time of 5 days, 3 hours and 3 minutes - exactly 10 minutes slower than its victory the previous year, but giving the vessel and skipper back-to-back wins. "Westward", skippered by GD Gibson was awarded handicap honours.

Florian Brandner

Florian Brandner is a fictional character on German soap opera "Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love)". The character was first played by Frédéric A. Komp from 2 January 1995 to the fall of 1996 and again in February 1997 and from June to October 1998. The character was recast with actor Alex Huber four years later, on 12 July 2002. Huber left after one and a half year, when the character was written out. He made his last appearance on 15 January 2004.
Character's background.
Florian is the youngest child of Arno Brandner (Konrad Krauss). His mother is Arno's first wife, Iris (Regina Nowack), who dies tragically in 1996, after she ended her marriage with Arno and left the family. In the beginning, sixteen-year-old Florian is in love with Anna Konrad (Alexandra Schalaudek), a girl from his school. But their love faces tragedy after tragedy. Anna's father Fritz (Joe Bausch) gets murdered and the prime suspect becomes Florian's older brother Jan (Andreas Brucker), who worked for Fritz in his fitness center until he got fired, short time before Fritz was murdered. For some time, Florian seems to be the only one who believes that Jan is innocent. Meanwhile, Anna's mother Hannelore (Brigitte Walbrun) wants to forbid her daughter to see Florian any longer. Somehow Florian convinces Anna to believe him that Jan is not guilty of Fritz' murder and they try to find out what really happened. Hannelore realizes several times that Anna is still seeing Florian and they fight more and more over Anna's relationship to him, which soon builds a wall between mother and daughter. Florian's suspicions for the true murderer of Fritz go so far that he suspects Hannelore. Fritz had many affairs in the last years and Hannelore's marriage with him seemed to be lost before he died. But when Florian gets contacted by Jan, who is on the flight since the police is looking for him, has another suspect: his best friend Oliver Kopp (then played by Hendrik Duryn), who is also the boyfriend of Jan and Florian's sister Susanne (Claudia Scarpatetti). Anna helps Florian to find evidence against Oliver. The find themselves surprised, when they find out that Fritz doped his athletes, without letting them know. Oliver found out about Fritz' dark secret. Because Fritz doped him too, he was able to blackmail Oliver to shut his mouth. When the two were arguing, Oliver dug him and Fritz fall so hard that he died. Florian warns Susanne to stay away from Oliver, but she already is in danger, when Oliver confesses to her and takes her hostage to flee from the police. Florian can rescue his sister by interfering. He is happy when Jan finally can return home.
But after all this drama, his relationship to Anna suffers when Hannelore can't forgive Florian that he thought she was the one who killed Fritz and that he even convinced Anna. She tries to destroy the relationship again. Florian and Anna fight more often, which leads Florian into sleeping with another girl, when he got drunk on a party. Anna sees them together in bed the next morning and breaks up with Florian. Meanwhile, Renate, the girl he slept with, develops feelings for Florian. She soon turns out to be a stalker, when she makes Florian expensive gifts and won't stay away from him - even after he already told her that he wants to get back with Anna. Because of Renate's games and she telling everyone that Florian loves only her, Anna believes Florian is the one that plays a game and plays both women. But in the end, Anna sees that Florian is telling the truth, when he paints a graffiti on the school wall. Renate wants revenge and feels humiliated in front of the entire school. She beats herself up and goes to Hannelore, trying to convince her that it was Florian. Hannelore believes her and threatens Florian that she would go to the police, if he finally doesn't stay away from Anna. When even Arno and Iris don't believe Florian's story of Renate, Anna and he decide to run away - right before his parents find out the truth. 
Years later, Florian is married to Isabell Mohr (Tanja Wenzel) and has a daughter, Carolin, which he legally accepted as his. He and his little family live together in Milan. They were last mentioned by Florian's father Arno in 2008, saying that Florian and Isabell still happy.

Miwa Yanagi

Life and works.
Miwa Yanagi was born in 1967 in Kobe, Japan. She completed her postgraduate course work at the Kyoto City University of Arts. She is known mainly as a photographer and video artist. She creates an elaborate, thoroughly thought out, and often costly staged event using female models ranging in different ages. They may display ages quite different from their own in the photos. After the picture or video is taken, the image may be altered by a computer in strange ways. The time spent working on the photo also insures that the final piece looks as realistic as possible, and the alterations that are merged with the actual images fit perfectly. The end result is a surrealistic image of everyday life.
Yanagi was influenced by a teacher in high school who was passionate for his art work. She decided to go into art and on to a university. Her big break came when she was nominated to be in an exhibition in Germany in 1996 at the Kunsthalle in Frankfurt. It was here that her works were exhibited along with artists like Cindy Sherman and Jeff Wall. The international exposure to a commercial art market gave her major advantage over other Japanese artists. Because of the lack of a contemporary art market in Japan and her success in Germany in 1996 she decided to display her work overseas. Yanagi currently works and lives in Kyoto, Japan. 
"Elevator Girls".
Yanagi's best known body of works is her first, "Elevator Girls". With it, she focuses on themes of everyday life, self-identity, architecture, and employment in the world of girls who operate the elevators of Japanese department stores. "Elevator Girls" first started as performance piece early in her career. It was to represent and reflect on what Yanagi was going through at this time. The performance was about a young girl who works in a narrow box, who has to repeat the same task over and over again, day after day. The later photographs of "Elevator Girls" show women dressed similarly and who often show very little emotion. The switch from performance art to photography was because Yanagi wanted complete control in what was going on. These young models are all physically similar in body composition. The way they are posed shows that they are restricted on what they can do and where they can go, much as restrictions are placed on women culturally. In the photos the elevator girls stare at architectural design or consumer goods. The staring represents society's obsession with consumer goods.
"My Grandmothers".
"My Grandmothers" was next. The series focuses on how young girls from between 14 and 20 years old perceive themselves. Yanagi asked young girls what they thought their life would be like in 50 years. If she liked the answer and felt inspired to work with it the interview was later photographed with models, some of whom came from the "Elevator Girls" series. During the interview process she eliminates those who seem to lack any real life experience. She believes that younger people restrict what they can do. When the age restriction is released, women are freer to express their wishes and desires. The more restricted a young girl feels today closely relates to the degree of freedom she will feel 50 years from now. After the interview is accepted, drawings are made. Then Yanagi photographs the scene she has imagined and put on paper. The photograph is then altered on a computer, to merge the girl's idea and Yanagi's surreal dream. The results show emotions ranging from sad to funny. A girl named Mie imagines that in 50 years she will be lonely, looking around a field of empty landscapes during a time of a cataclysm. One named Yuka believes she will be living somewhere on the U.S. coast without a care in the world and with a playboy for a lover. Along with each photo comes a verse based on the interviews and the photos.
"Fairy Tales".
In Yanagi's third popular series, "Fairy Tales", she focuses on stories in which the main characters are usually simultaneously both old and young and deals with the relationships between the two ages. The stories are based on fairy tales told by the Brothers Grimm, which are often more gruesome and horrible than the watered-down versions told to children. The gruesome quality appealed to Yanagi and helped her show the difference between youth and old age. She first released the series in 2005 at the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art and Ohara Museum of Art. They are presented as large black-and-white photos. Yanagi abandons her computer here for more traditional methods. She also uses models who are not Japanese. Young mixed-raced girls are given wigs, makeup, and latex masks to look like old, witch-like, hags. What is left is a strange unresolved combination of an old woman with youthful limbs and appendages, confusing the distinction between old and young. For example, in the 2005 "Snow White", a young girl can be seen looking into the mirror, but instead of a beautiful young lady looking back at her, she sees an old unattractive old lady. In a second example, "Gretel", a young girl can be seen gnawing on the finger of an unseen witch. This leaves the viewer wondering which is the captor. This series is the complete opposite of "Elevator Girls", where the models are shown as pretty, have little emotion and are similar.
Video.
In the video "Suna Onna" (i.e. "sand woman", 2005) Yanagi shows the relationship between a child and her grandmother. The grandmother tells the granddaughter of her meeting with a sand woman as a child. It is meant to be a tale of transformation and the supernatural world. In other videos she shows uniformed women who change their surroundings with a wave of their hand.
Performances.
Although known more for photography and video, Yanagi also did performance pieces before she switched to photography. The main subject was what she was going through as a young woman in Japan. "Elevator Girls" was originally a performance piece. Yanagi also did another performance piece in which she hired someone who was to show contemporary art in a museum to visitors as a real guide would. Yanagi gave them a script on what to say and at what points during the tour that they were supposed to perform certain gestures. The guide was totally believable in this performance, wearing the same uniform as regular tour guides and speaking in the same manner. People seemed more interested in the tour guide than the actual art work. Some people even left the museum after the guide finished speaking. In Yanagi's view the performance is about the feeling of pleasure and the experience. It was more about the performance by the guide than actual artwork in the museum. Yanagi's current subjects are the lives of women and how they are perceived in the modern world. Here she looks on how women are treated and viewed by society and also how women culturally view themselves.
Exhibitions.
In 1993 Yanagi held her first solo exhibition, and since 1996 her work has been exhibited in both solo and group shows throughout Europe and the United States.
Her solo shows include:

La Nativité du Seigneur

La Nativité du Seigneur ("The Nativity of the Lord" or "The Birth of the Saviour") is a work for organ, written by the French composer Olivier Messiaen in 1935.
"La Nativité du Seigneur" is a testament to Messiaen's Christian faith, being divided into nine "meditations" inspired by the birth of Jesus. In volume one, Messiaen outlines his inspirations, both theological, instrumental and compositional. As the composer notes in his preface, he sought "the emotion and sincerity first". The work was written by the composer at the age of 27 years during the summer of 1935 while he was in residence at Grenoble near the French Alps. Messiaen wrote that in addition to theology, the movements were inspired by the mountains, as well as the stained glass windows in medieval cathedrals.
The work was premiered on 27 February 1936 on the organ of La Trinité, Paris, shared among three players: Daniel-Lesur (1–3), Jean Langlais (4–6), Jean-Jacques Grunenwald (7–9).
Movements.
The work is in nine movements, each depicting an image or concept from the birth of Jesus. In publication, the work is divided over four books.
The work is one of the earliest to feature elements that were to become key to Messiaen's later compositions, such as the extensive use of the composer's own modes of limited transposition, as well as influence from birdsong, and the meters and rhythms of Ancient Greek and traditional Indian music.
In 1967, Richard Franko Goldman wrote, "One is, indeed, tempted to say that the work is a masterpiece, and one of the great organ works of all time. It is certainly monumental and impressive, original and memorable, with or without the theoretical and mystical explanation the composer himself gives out."

E86 cluster bomb

The E86 cluster bomb was an American biological cluster bomb first developed in 1951. Though the U.S. military intended to procure 6,000 E86s, the program was halted in the first half of the 1950s.
History.
The E86 cluster bomb was developed as a biological weapon by the United States Army Chemical Corps and the United States Air Force beginning in October 1951. The Ralph M. Parsons Company was contracted to produce the E86 in October 1952. In 1953 procurement began for 6,000 E86 cluster bombs, with their production expected no earlier than 1958. When U.S. military munition requirements were reviewed in the first half of the 1950s, production and further development of the E86 was halted. The E86 cluster bomb supplanted technologies such as the E77 balloon bomb.
Specifications.
The E86 was similar to the M115 biological bomb, except it was larger. While the M115 weighed , the E86 was a weapon. Regardless, operationally, the E86 was similar to the M115. It was designed as an anti-crop weapon; the U.S. biological weapons program produced three anti crop agents, wheat and rye stem rust and rice blast. The weapon was in a steel case and intended to be dropped from the exterior of an aircraft such as the B-47 or B-52. Sub-munitions included the E14 munition; the sub-munition was originally intended as anti-crop weapons as well, but was later altered and used in testing as the U.S. pursued an entomological warfare program.

Sprent Arumogo Dabwido (born 16 September 1972) is a Nauruan politician who formerly served as the President of Nauru. The son of a former parliamentarian, Dabwido was originally elected to the Meneng Constituency in the Parliament of Nauru at the 2004 elections. Having served as Minister for Telecommunications in Marcus Stephen's government from 2009, Dabwido joined the Nauruan opposition faction in November 2011 after Stephen's resignation, and, having passed a motion of no confidence against interim president Freddie Pitcher, was elected president four days later. In his role as president, Dabwido functioned as chairman of the Cabinet of Nauru, and held various portfolios in the Nauruan government.
Biography.
The second son of former parliamentarian Audi Dabwido, Dabwido worked in public insurance before entering politics. He was a founding member of the Naoero Amo party, and was elected to the Parliament of Nauru at the 2004 elections, defeating Nimrod Botelanga to win the seat of Meneng. Re-elected at the 2007 and 2008 elections, he became a member of the parliamentary faction supporting President Marcus Stephen, and was made Minister for Telecommunications in Stephen's government in 2009 where he presided over the introduction of mobile phones to Nauru. Again re-elected at the 2010 elections, Dabwido joined the opposition faction in November 2011 after Stephen resigned as president, and was replaced by Freddie Pitcher. 
President of Nauru.
After moving a motion of no confidence in Pitcher, Dabwido was elected president by the parliament, with nine votes supporting his nomination and eight votes opposing.
Dabwido's first major international meeting as president was at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, as a representative of the Pacific Islands grouping of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In his speech during the opening plenary, Dabwido evaluated the potential problems faced by islands in the Pacific Ocean resulting from rising sea levels. Reiterating the SIDS objective for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent further global climate change, he called for the development of a legally binding protcol alongside the Kyoto Protocol, with reference to "mitigation actions for developing countries" and the Bali Action Plan. Dabwido supports the re-opening of the Australian-tax-payer-funded asylum seeker processing centre in Nauru, which is supported by the opposition Liberal Party of Australia but opposed by the governing Australian Labor Party. In June 2012, Dabwido sacked his cabinet after seven months in office, citing difficulty in passing the Constitutional Amendment Parliamentary Amendments Bill, a proposed constitutional reform bill that would alter the number of members of parliament, introduce an Ombudsman Commission, and introduce a code of ethics for parliamentarians. In his new Cabinet, he filled the positions of Minister for Public Service, Minister for Police & Emergency Services, Minister for Home Affairs, and Minister for Climate Change. On behalf of Nauru, Dabwido made his first address to the United Nations General Assembly during the general debate of its sixty-seventh session, in September 2012. During his speech, he urged the UN to address climate change more directly, as well as criticising the ineffectiveness of multilateralism. 
Dabwido did not stand for re-election, and was replaced by Baron Waqa after the 2013 parliamentary elections.

Stanford Viaduct is a railway viaduct in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. It is named after the nearby village of Stanford on Soar.
Built as part of the Great Central Railway's London Extension opened in 1899, it carried the Great Central Main Line over the River Soar and a road (Meadow Lane). It was built by the contractor Henry Lovatt of Wolverhampton, out of blue brick. The three central arches are skewed to allow the Soar to pass underneath.
When the rest of the GCML was closed in the 1960s, the section from Loughborough South Junction was kept open as a branch of the Midland Main Line to the British Gypsum works at East Leake.
Presently, the viaduct is in use for gypsum trains, and diesel or steam heritage trains from the Nottingham Heritage Centre.

Ettore Pozzoli

Ettore Pozzoli (July 23, 1873 – November 9, 1957) was an Italian classical pianist and composer.
Biography.
Born in the Italian city of Seregno, Ettore Pozzoli began his career soon after he received his music diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1895. While writing music for piano and orchestra, he started teaching at the Milan Conservatory. His works on theory and solfeggio, even nowadays considered the basis of the studies of any pianist, are known for the progressive difficulty, for harmony and counterpoint. 
His composition “Danza fantastica” was chosen in 1956 as the compulsory piece for competitors at the sixth World Accordion Contest in Danzica. 
Pozzoli died on 9 November 1957 in Seregno (Italy), where, since 1959, an international piano contest in his honour takes place organized by the City.
International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition.
The International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition, for tradition and amount of prize, is one of the oldest and most prestigious piano competitions in the world taking place in Seregno, Italy since 1959 and held every 2 years.

Kanto Plainsman

The "Kanto Plainsman" was a consolidated United States Air Force newspaper out of Tachikawa Air Base from 1961 to 1970 covering news and events of that base, as well as Fuchu Air Station, Grant Heights Housing, Green Park Housing, Washington Heights Housing, Yamato Air Station, Showa Air Station, Iwo Jima, Marcus Island, Ofuna and other minor detached Air Force properties in Japan's Kanto Plain area. The only nearby base to retain its own newspaper was Yokota Air Base.
Origins.
The first issue, Vol. I no. 1, appeared on 30 June 1961, replacing Tachikawa's paper "The Marauder" and other separate base papers. The appearance of the "Kanto Plainsman" coincided with the activation of the 6100th Support Wing at Tachikawa. The free paper was an official AF publication that contained no advertisements and ranged from 12 to 20 pages per issue.
Content.
A typical issue consisted of articles on significant and minor local events, individual and unit awards, ceremonies, sports, birth announcements and event schedules, as well as general Air Force information and stories. Most articles were accompanied by photographs. The paper was entirely in English with a target audience of Air Force personnel and dependents stationed in Japan, and like all Air Force newspapers was intended as key source of command information. A Japanese-language version of the paper was published for Japanese nationals working at the above-mentioned American Air Force facilities.
The End of the Kanto Plainsman.
The final issue, Vol. X No. 16, was published on 24 April 1970, after which it merged with Yokota AB's newspaper, The Afterburner. The demise of "Kanto Plainsman" occurred soon after flying operations ceased at Tachikawa and the Air Force began its Kanto Consolidation program. MSgt George E. O'Brien was the "Kanto Plainsman"'s editor for the final issues.

"Bailemos un vals" (, ) was the Spanish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978, performed in Spanish by José Vélez. 
The song is a ballad in 3/4 time in which Vélez sings about a French girl called Michèle, whom he spent a summer with and now cannot find. He sings that when he does find his Michèle again, he will ask her in her own language: ""Voulez-vous danser avec moi? Do you want to dance a waltz?"" Velez also recorded the song in French and German, as "Voulez-vous danser avec moi?" and "Voulez-vous danser avec moi? (Señorita wir sind ein Paar)" respectively. The song was written by Manuel de la Calva and Ramón Arcusa, the team beind Massiel's winning entry in the 1968 Contest, "La, la, la". 
The song was performed seventh on the night, following France's Joël Prévost with "Il y aura toujours des violons" and preceding United Kingdom's Co-Co) with "The Bad Old Days". At the close of voting, it had received 65 points, placing 9th in a field of 20.

The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children, And The Family is a book of social criticism written by Marie Winn and published in 1977 by Viking Penguin with the ISBN 0140076980. In it, Winn brought the communications medium of television under withering fire, accusing it of wielding an addictive influence on the very young.
Wrote Winn: "The very nature of the television experience apart from the contents of the programs is rarely considered. Perhaps the ever-changing array of sights and sounds coming out of the machine--the wild variety of images meeting the eye and the barrage of human and inhuman sounds reaching the ear--fosters the illusion of a varied experience for the viewer. It is easy to overlook a deceptively simple fact: one is always "watching television" when one is watching television rather than having any other experience."
A 25th-anniversary revision was published in 2002, which included new material that was subtitled "Television, Computers, And Family Life". Winn was even more hostile to the Internet and the World Wide Web than she had been to television itself twenty-five years before.

Aloysius Amwano

Aloysius Arabao Iyomogo Edrick Amwano (also called "Ali Amwano"; b. 21 June 1955) is a Nauruan politician.
Successive reversals of electoral fortune.
Amwano started his parliamentary career in 1998, when he won a vacated seat in a by-election for the Ubenide Constituency following the resignation of former president Lagumot Harris.
2000, 2001 & 2003 polls.
In the 2000 general elections he was re-elected; during a political crisis in 2001 all four Ubenide members lost their seats in parliament, but along with two colleagues Amwano subsequently regained the seat in the following by-election. After the 2003 general elections he lost his seat to Fabian Ribauw.
2008 & 2010 elections.
In 2008 he was re-elected to parliament, ousting Ribauw. He became part of President Marcus Stephen's parliamentary majority, before switching over to the opposition in 2010. He was one of three non-Cabinet government MPs to switch to the opposition after benefiting from a trip to Singapore organised and paid for by the Australian company Getax, which buys Nauruan phosphate. Getax had just sought, unsuccessfully, to propose a loan to the Stephen government, with contractual clauses enabling it (the company) to take over Nauru's phosphate industry in the event that the government defaulted in repaying. Following the Getax-funded trip, Amwano and two other MPs withdrew their support for the government, joining the opposition and causing Parliament to be evenly split between government and opposition MPs. This resulted in fresh parliamentary elections in April 2010, in which Amwano retained his seat. On 30 June 2010, he was elected Speaker, and demanded that Stephen stand down as president. On 6 July, opposition MP Rykers Solomon joined the government, potentially giving it the numbers to re-elect Stephen, or to elect a new president from within its ranks. As Speaker, however, Amwano refused to allow the election for president (by MPs) to be held. Amwano was dismissed by Stephen the following day, but refused to relinquish his post. In a short parliamentary session held on 9 July, Deputy Speaker Landon Deireragea announced that he had assumed the Speaker's position in Amwano's place.
In October, the Nauruan government accused Getax of having paid significant sums of money to opposition MPs, and of having funded the opposition's election campaign. The Australian Federal Police investigated the allegations that Getax had bribed Nauruan MPs "to influence the political regime in Nauru in order to increase their stake in the country's phosphate". Amwano spoke up to defend Getax, denying any wrongdoing and adding that he "would be happy for the Australian Federal Police to investigate".
2013 Election.
Amwano was defeated in the 2013 elections, and was replaced by Ranin Akua.

Desertserges

Desertserges ("An Díseart" in Irish) is a parish between the towns of Enniskean and Bandon, County Cork, Ireland. The parish of Desertserges consist of about of land on the south side of the river Bandon - the river being its northern boundary for about . Most of the area is hilly, rising from 60 to 230 meters. The fertility of the land is varied with some fertile areas as well as barren uplands.
History.
It is believed that the site at Desertserges may well have been sacred before the arrival of Christianity in Ireland. Looked at from the air the graveyard is fairly circular in shape, which is often an indication of pre-Christian antiquity. The early Christians often adopted sites that were already sacred. 
The name of the parish comes from a hermit, named Serges who made his home somewhere in the parish. The Irish word "Díseart Seargus" literally means "the hermitage of Serges". There was a Celtic Christian monastic Community at nearby Kinneigh which is believed to have been founded by St. Colman between 617 and 619 CE. It is likely that Serges was a part of that community even though he would have spent much time in solitude. Desertserges was an easy half day’s walk away from Kinneigh for a fit person through the scrub and woods that grew in this area at that time, and across the river Bandon. It is not known for certain exactly where the hermitage of Serges was – some historians say it was a few meters east of the present church and that is probably where the original church stood. The present church (St. Mary's) was built in 1805.
Prior to the 12th century, Desertserges was one of seven parishes which comprised a diocese of Kinneigh. In 1199 it was included in new diocese of Cork by papal decree.
In Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837, Desertserges is described as containing 6,629 inhabitants.
Today.
Today, Desertserges remains a rural parish. There is one primary school, Desertserges National School, with about 24 children.
Agriculture remains the dominant local industry.

Sir Henry Knollys KCVO (20 June 1840 – 1 March 1930) was an officer in the Royal Artillery, British Army, and from 1896 to 1919 a private secretary to Princess Maud of Wales (from 1905 Queen of Norway).
Family.
Knollys was the third and last surviving son of General the Right Hon. Sir William Thomas Knollys and grandson of General William Knollys, titular Earl of Banbury, who discontinued the use of the title in 1813, in consequence of a resolution in the House of Lords adverse to his claim. His elder brother Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys (1837-1924) was for many years Private Secretary successively to King Edward VII and to King George V; and his sister the Honourable Charlotte Knollys (1835-1930) was for years the devoted friend and servant of Queen Alexandra.
He married first, in 1876, Louisa Elizabeth Eyre (who died in 1888), daughter of Reverend E Eyre; and second, in 1909, Flora Goodeve, daughter of Louis Arthur Goodeve. There were no children of either marriage.
Early Life and military career.
Henry Knollys was born on June 20, 1840, was educated at Westminster School, and joined the Royal Artillery from Woolwich in 1860. He was on the staff of General Sir James Scarlett and of General Sir Hope Grant, and was subsequently Brigade Major, R.A., Aldershot, and Deputy Adjutant Quartermaster General., Northern District. From 1889 to 1891 he commanded the R.A. in South Africa.
Courtier.
In 1896 he was appointed Private Secretary and Comptroller in Britain to the Princess Maud of Wales on her marriage to Prince Charles of Denmark, and continued in that office when her Royal Highness became Queen of Norway upon her husband´s election as such in November 1905. He retired in 1919. 
He was created a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in August 1901, promoted to a Commander (CVO) in 1905, and knighted as a Knight Commander (KCVO) during the visit of the Norwegian royal couple to the UK in 1906. He also held the Danish Order of the Dannebrog and the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav.
Author.
Sir Henry Knollys was the biographer of his old chief, Sir Hope Grant, with whom he wrote "Incidents in the Sepoy War" and "Incidents in the China War." He was also the author of "From Sedan to Saarbruck," "Sketches of Life in Japan," and "English Life in China." From time to time Sir Henry Knollys contributed interesting letters to "The Times", notably one to the discussion on the circumstances of the French Prince Imperial's death. He related that he had seen the Prince's mount, a grey gelding about 15.3 hands high, then in the possession of Colonel Southey, who explained that the unusual height of the horse had prevented the Prince from mounting quickly enough.
Colonel Sir Henry Knollys, died at Bournemouth, Hampshire, on March 1 in his 90th year. The funeral service was held at Holy Trinity, Brompton, on Friday 7 March, and the interment was at Highgate Cemetery.

Arctic geoengineering

Temperatures in the Arctic region have tended to increase more rapidly than the global average. Projections of sea ice loss that are adjusted to take account of recent rapid Arctic shrinkage suggest that the Arctic will likely be free of summer sea ice sometime between 2059 and 2078. Various geoengineering schemes have been suggested to reduce the chance of significant and irreversible effects such as Arctic methane release.
Several geoengineering proposals have been made which are specific to the Arctic. They are usually hydrological in nature, and principally centre upon measures to prevent Arctic Ice Loss. These are detailed below.
In addition, other solar radiation management geoengineering techniques, such as stratospheric sulfur aerosols have been proposed. These will cool the Arctic by adjusting the albedo of the atmosphere.
Background.
The Arctic region plays an important role in the regulation of the Earth's climate. Conditions in the Arctic may suggest the existence of tipping points, including ice-albedo feedback from melting Arctic sea ice and Arctic methane release from melting permafrost and methane clathrate. The speed of future retreat of the Arctic sea ice is contentious. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report of 2007 states that "in some projections, Arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century." However, the ice has since undergone unexpectedly significant retreat, reaching a record low area in summer 2007 before recovering somewhat in 2008.
A 'tipping' process could potentially commence as the Arctic region warms, if there is positive feedback with sufficient gain. Professor Tim Lenton suggests that the retreat of sea ice is such a process, and the tipping may have started already. Geoengineering has been proposed for preventing or reversing tipping point events in the Arctic, in particular to halt the retreat of the sea ice.
Preventing such ice loss is important for climate control, as the Arctic Ice regulates global temperatures by virtue of its albedo, and also by restraining methane emissions from permafrost near the shoreline in the Arctic region. Additionally, the sea ice has a wider regional climatic role, and acts to maintain permafrost more generally in the region, by insulating the cold winter winds from the warm sea.
Building thicker sea ice.
It has been proposed to actively enhance the polar ice cap by spraying or pumping water onto the top of it which would build thicker sea ice. As ice is an insulator, water on the surface of the ice tends to freeze more quickly than that below. River water could be used for this purpose, as salt water tends to resist freezing, and may end up perforating the resulting ice sheet.
Thickening ice by spraying seawater onto existing ice has been proposed. Sea ice is an effective thermal insulator, and thus freezing takes place much more rapidly on the top surface of the ice sheet than on the bottom. Thicker sea ice is more structurally stable, and is more resistant to melting due to its increased mass. An additional benefit of this method is that the increased salt content of the melting ice will tend to strengthen downwelling currents when the ice re-melts.
Stratospheric sulfur aerosols.
Ken Caldeira et al. analysed the effect of geoengineering in the Arctic using Stratospheric sulfur aerosols This technique is not specific to the Arctic region. He found that "At high latitudes, there is less sunlight deflected per unit albedo change but climate system feedbacks operate more powerfully there. These two effects largely cancel each other, making the global mean temperature response per unit top-of-atmosphere albedo change relatively insensitive to latitude."
Influencing ocean temperature and salinity.
It has been suggested that locally influencing salinity and temperature of the Arctic Ocean, by changing the ratio of Pacific and fluvial waters entering through the Bering Strait could play a key role in preserving Arctic sea ice. The purpose would be to create a relative increase of fresh water inflow from the Yukon River, while blocking (part) of the warm and saltier waters from the Pacific Ocean. Proposed geoengineering options include a dam connecting St. Lawrence Island and a threshold under the narrow part of the strait.

Love, Italian Style is a studio album recorded by American pop singer Connie Francis.
During October 1966, Francis recorded several Italian language tracks at Milan Ricordi Studios in Rome, Italy. Some tracks were Italian language cover versions of her current US hits, such as "Spanish Nights and You", while others were of Italian origin, such as "Regent's Park" (the theme song for an Italian television mini series) and "Canta ragazzina", her entry for the 1967 edition of the Sanremo Festival.
The album was produced by Pete Spargo, the orchestra being conducted by Iller Pattacini. The album consists of traditional Italian songs brought up to date with combined arrangements of traditional Italian instruments (e.g. mandolins) and modern instruments (e.g. electric guitars).
Francis sings all songs either entirely in Neapolitan or bilingually in Neapolitan and English.
