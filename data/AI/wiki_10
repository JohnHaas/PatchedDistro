Paul R. Lehman (born 1931) served as president of the Music Educators National Conference () from 1984-1986. He served as chair of MENC's National Commission on Instruction, the committee that produced "The School Music Program: Description and Standards." The Commission was formed as a result of the Goals and Objectives Project (GO Project), begun in 1969 to implement the recommendations of the Tanglewood symposium. The project developed four major goals and thirty-five specific objectives. The goals were to carry out comprehensive music programs in all schools, involve persons of all ages in learning music, support the quality preparation of teachers, and use the most effective techniques and resources in music instruction. The National Executive Board marked eight of the thirty-five objectives for immediate attention.
Ann Arbor Symposium.
Lehman also served as chair of The Ann Arbor Symposium on Research in the Psychology of Music Learning. These gatherings, held between 1978 and 1982, provided the opportunity for music educators to meet with the leading psychologists and learning theorists. The first two meetings were dedicated to the applications of psychology to music teaching and learning. The third meeting concentrated on motivation and creativity.

A bowling shirt is a men's shirt that resembles an aloha shirt in construction, but not appearance, typically being more conservative and not incorporating tropically themed prints. They are loose-fitting, collared, short sleeved, buttoned shirts, with a straight hem designed to be worn not tucked into the pants. The fabric, color and design vary greatly, but frequently incorporate contrasting earth tones and simple geometric designs, with more expensive ones often made of silk. They may have a single breast pocket on the left—small logos or monogram initials are also common options on the left breast.

Mord Fiddle

Mord Sighvatsson (c. 900-968), better known as Mord "Fiddle" (Old Norse: Morðr Gigja) was a wealthy Icelandic farmer and expert on Icelandic law who lived during the late Settlement Period and early Commonwealth Period. According to "Njals Saga", he was the son of Sighvat the Red, but "Landnámabók" asserts that Mord was Sighvat's grandson. Mord was the father of Unn Mordardottir, who for a time was married to Hrútr Herjólfsson.
Gunnhild, Mother of Kings, the mother of Harald II of Norway and his brothers and Queen Mother of Norway, had been Hrútr's patron and lover while he sojourned in that land. When Hrútr returned home, Gunnhild gave him many presents, but she cursed Hrútr with priapism to ruin his marriage to Unn. It was Mord who masterminded Unn's divorce from Hrútr by advising her on procedures she could use to name witnesses and announce the divorce while Hrut was away.

Tessitura (software)

Tessitura is an enterprise application used by performing arts and cultural organisations to manage their activities in ticketing, fundraising, customer relationship management, and marketing. It refers to itself as "arts enterprise software".
History and business model.
Tessitura was originally developed by and for the Metropolitan Opera of New York.
One of the most interesting aspects of the Tessitura system, which distinguishes it from most other commercial software, is the business model chosen by the Metropolitan Opera in order to commercialize what was originally custom software. The Metropolitan Opera maintains ownership of the intellectual property in the original software, but established a separate organization called Tessitura Network (as a not-for-profit corporation with 501(c)3 status under United States tax law) to manage the ongoing development and support of the system. The Tessitura Network now licenses users, handles management, maintenance and development of the system, and fosters an active exchange of best practices and knowledge sharing within the nonprofit arts and cultural sector. The Tessitura Network is effectively a cooperative enterprise, governed via a Board elected by and from, and representative of, the licensees of the system. 
This business model has an obvious resonance with the not-for-profit and self-governing ethos of the arts community, and is one reason why Tessitura has rapidly come to dominate the (deliberately restricted) market in which it operates - English-speaking, not-for-profit, arts organisations with a need for ticketing and fundraising systems.
This model has resulted in a number of interesting characteristics for Tessitura Network as a software company. 
System functionality.
The Tessitura system is designed to be flexible, customizable, and open, and therefore has a good capacity to be tailored for each organization. Functional areas include:

Elsie Leslie (1881-1966) was an American actress. She was America's first child star and the highest paid and most popular child actress of her era.
Life and career.
Elsie's first role in 1894 was Little Meenie in Joseph Jefferson's production of "Rip Van Winkle". In 1887, she was recognized as a star with her performance in "Editha's Burglar" opposite E. H. Sothern at the Lyceum Theatre in New York and opposite William Gillette on the road tour. She achieved further fame with her roles in "Little Lord Fauntleroy" in 1888 and "The Prince and the Pauper" in 1890. The most enduring image of Leslie is the portrait of her, posing as Little Lord Fauntleroy, painted by William Merritt Chase. 
Elsie lived in the rarefied kingdom of the theater. She moved amongst and conversed with people everywhere she went and her friends were not only nearly all adults, they were among the most accomplished in the nation. She had pen pals everywhere with whom she maintained a lively correspondence, including leading actors, actresses and statesmen, as well as two young girls nearer her own age, one younger, the other a year older: Eleanor Roosevelt and Helen Keller. "I like to write letters," she once said, "but I like to get the ansers still better."
Elsie took a break from acting, but returned to the stage in 1898 to play parts in "The Rivals", "The Cricket on the Hearth", "The Christian", "The Taming of the Shrew", "The Man on the Case" in 1907, and Louis N. Parker's "Disraeli" with George Arliss in 1911; but after years away from the stage she could not recapture the old magic as an adult. She had married Jefferson Winter, son of drama critic William Winter, but this marriage ended in divorce, after which Else married Edwin J. Millikin in 1918. She and her husband traveled the world until they returned to New York, where she lived until her death in 1966.
Elsie was known as a wonderful child. She carried on correspondence with her friends from her acting days until her death. Photographs of Elsie, parts of her diary, along with letters and cards from such luminaries as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, Edwin Booth, William Gillette, Elliott Roosevelt and Joseph Jefferson, are recorded in "Trustable & Preshus Friends".
She is also remembered by the "Elsie Leslie" doll by Madame Alexander, No. 1560 in the series.

Thomas E. Drumm

Thomas E. Drumm (1909-1990) was a government official who specialized in U.S. government relations with private industry.
Military career.
In June 1941 Drumm joined the U.S. Army as an enlisted man, and was commissioned a lieutenant in January 1943. He spent most of the war assigned to the Second Service Command of the Army Service Forces at Governor’s Island, New York. His job was to screen civilian applicants for sensitive positions in privately operated war plants. He also helped make arrangements for visiting dignitaries, and participated in the ceremonies associated with Dwight D. Eisenhower’s homecoming visit to New York in June 1945. In July 1945 Drumm became an aide to General Jacob Devers, Commander of the Army Ground Forces, and worked at the Pentagon until his discharge in May 1946.
Government career.
After his discharge, Drumm obtained a job at the War Assets Administration, an agency responsible for disposing of surplus property acquired by the U.S. government during World War II. Drumm worked as an assistant to the WAA administrator, General Robert Littlejohn, and also in the Office of Real Property Disposal, the branch of WAA that disposed of surplus industrial plants and real estate.
The WAA was abolished in June 1949 and Drumm transferred to the Department of Defense. He spent the summer and fall of 1949 making a survey of management practices at the Army Corps of Engineers. In December 1949 he was sent to London, England, where he joined the staff of the North Atlantic Defense Production Board. The Board was a NATO agency that helped coordinate defense production by NATO countries. The Board was dissolved in May 1952 and Drumm was transferred to Paris where he worked briefly for the U.S. Special Representative, Europe.
In late 1952 Drumm returned to Washington, D.C., and assumed a position with the Foreign Operations Administration where he worked until 1954. He then worked for the Bureau of the Budget on projects involving the disposal of surplus real property. In 1958 he transferred to the Business and Defense Services Administration, a branch of the Department of Commerce, where he served as Assistant Administrator and Administrator.
In early 1962 Drumm was sent to France where he served as Counselor for Commercial Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. In this position he collected information on French business developments which he reported to the Departments of State and Commerce. He also assisted U.S. companies that were interested in doing business in France, and French companies that were interested in doing business in the U.S.
In 1967 Drumm returned to the United States and served in the Office of Field Services in the Department of Commerce. This office coordinated the work of various field offices in the United States that provided information to domestic businesses. In 1971 Maurice Stans, the Secretary of Commerce, appointed Drumm the first Ombudsman for Business. As ombudsman, Drumm helped private businesses in their dealings with various U.S. government agencies.
Later career.
Drumm retired from government service in July 1973 and went to work for Macmillan, Inc., a New York City publishing company specializing in non-fiction and educational works. Drumm was placed in charge of Macmillan’s Washington, DC, office. He was responsible for handling Macmillan’s contacts with government agencies. He also lobbied Congress in matters regarding copyright legislation and other matters of concern to the publishing industry.
In 1980 a European conglomerate acquired Macmillan, Inc., in a hostile takeover and many high-level executives lost their positions. Drumm was ordered to close the Washington office. For a few months he continued his work for the company out of his home but in November 1980 was forced to retire.

<doc id="20881341" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20881341" title="Rare disease assumption">
Rare disease assumption

The rare disease assumption is a mathematical assumption in epidemiologic case-control studies where the hypothesis tests the association between an exposure and a disease. It is assumed that, if the prevalence of the disease is low, then the odds ratio approaches the relative risk.
Case control studies are relatively inexpensive and less time consuming than cohort studies. Since case control studies don't track patients over time, they can't establish relative risk. The case control study can, however, calculate the exposure-odds ratio, which, mathematically, is supposed to approach the relative risk as prevalence falls.
Some authors state that if the prevalence of 10% or less than the disease can be considered as rare enough to allow the rare disease assumption. Unfortunately the magnitude of discrepancy between the odds ratio and the relative risk is not only dependant of the prevalence but also highly of two other factors. 
The following example will illustrate this difficulty clearly. Consider a standard table showing the association between two binary variables with frequencies a = true positives = 49005929, b = false positives = 50994071, c = false negatives = 50994071 and d = true negatives = 849005929. In this case the odds ratio (OR) is equal to 16 and the relative risk (RR) is equal to 8,65. Although the prevalence in our example equals 10% it is very difficult to apply the rare disease assumption because OR and RR can hardly be considered to be approximately the same. However, in this example the disease is not particularly "rare"; a 10% prevalence value means 1 in 10 people would have it. As the prevalence drops lower and lower, OR approaches the RR much more closely. This is one of the most problematic aspects of the rare disease assumption, since there is no threshold prevalence below which a disease is considered "rare", and thus no strict guideline to determine when the assumption applies

Tarnished Lady

Tarnished Lady is a 1931 American drama film directed by George Cukor. The screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart is based on his short story "A Story of a New York Lady." 
Plot.
Nancy Courtney, a once wealthy socialite, has had to struggle to maintain a facade of prosperity ever since her father's death. Although she loves writer DeWitt Taylor, who is indifferent to amassing a fortune, her mother urges her to marry stockbroker Norman Cravath instead. Nancy acquiesces to her mother's wishes but, despite the fact her new husband does everything he can to please her, she is miserable in her marriage.
Meanwhile, DeWitt has begun romancing Norman's former girl friend Germaine Prentiss, Nancy's long-time rival. She realizes DeWitt's relationship with Germaine is changing him into a social climber. Unaware Norman's firm has just been barred from the stock market and he is facing financial ruin, Nancy tells her husband she is leaving him. She learns of Norman's bankruptcy in the newspaper and, together with her friend Ben Sterner, she goes to a speakeasy where she proceeds to get drunk. She and Ben bring some of the bar patrons to his home, where they encounter Norman, who is waiting there to discuss a business transaction with Ben. Seeing his wife in such a disreputable state, he tells her he never wants to see her again.
Nancy tries to live on her own but, lacking any skills, she is unable to find employment and becomes destitute. When she discovers she is pregnant, Ben offers her a place to live and, after the birth of her child, he hires her to work in his department store. Norman and Germaine come in to purchase a fur coat, and Norman is stunned to find Nancy in a menial position. Germaine tries to warn Nancy away, but realizing her husband still loves her, Nancy asks him for another chance. Germaine bows out and leaves Norman with his forgiven wife and infant son.
Critical reception.
Mordaunt Hall of the "New York Times" observed, "Miss Bankhead acquits herself with considerable distinction, but the vehicle to which she lends her talent is no masterpiece. In fact, only in a few spots is the author's fine hand discernible." 
"Variety" called it a "weepy and ragged melodrama has little outside its cast to be recommended . . . Cast, as a whole, deports in a manner suggesting they were under orders to give way before Bankhead. Clive Brook suffers the most. Ordinarily a fine actor, he slumps here in trying to get over some of the silly dialog."

Martyn Jordan

Martyn Jordan (7 March 1865 – 14 July 1902) was an English-born international rugby union player who played club rugby for London Welsh and Newport and international rugby for Wales. Jordan played in three games for Wales scoring two tries, though at the time scoring tries carried no points.
Rugby career.
Jordan first played first class rugby for Newport Rugby Club, but moved to London to study medicine. While in London he initially played for Guy's Hospital before the exile team, London Welsh was created in 1885. Jordan played in the first London Welsh game, played at the Saracen's ground against London Scottish; alongside fellow Newport player and Wales rugby legend Arthur Gould. When London Welsh took part in their first tour of South Wales, the team took in Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and a South Wales XV over a six-day period. When the team faced Newport, Jordan refereed the match rather than play as he represented both teams.
Jordan first represented Wales when he was still with Newport in early 1885, when he was chosen to face England as part of the Home Nations Championship. Wales lost the game, but Jordan played well and scored two tries, one of which Gould, also appearing in his first game for Wales, converted. Jordan returned for the very next match of the tournament against Scotland in a nil-nil draw. Jordan's next game for Wales was his last and took another four years to achieve, and by this time he was playing most of his club rugby for London Welsh. The game was against Scotland and was played as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship, away from home at Raeburn Place, Wales lost to Scotland and Jordan was never selected for Wales again.
In the 1888/89 season, Jordan was given the captaincy of London Welsh and the tactical changes he brought to the club during this season is seen as a major factor in changing the club into a repectable opponent in Britain.

Beverage opener

A beverage opener (also known as a multi-opener) is a device used to open beverage cans, plastic bottles or glass bottles, which are the three most common beverage containers. 
Types.
Beverage openers vary in size but commonly include a glass bottle cap opener, a plastic bottle cap grip for greater twisting torque and a stay tab lifting mechanism for metal beverage cans. Some cans have extra conveniences built in such as magnetic backing to catch and hold metal caps or stick to a refrigerator door.
Benefits.
Beverage openers are useful for opening every day beverage containers for those who have limited hand strength as it eliminates the need for strong twisting or pulling motions. Plastic bottles may become stuck due to a high volume of carbonation released during shipping or overtightening. Some do not have fingernails with which to properly use a stay tab and glass bottles almost always require some sort of bottle opener.

Flour Bluff, Corpus Christi, Texas

Flour Bluff is a specified area of the city of Corpus Christi, Texas. It is located on Encinal peninsula bordered by Corpus Christi Bay on the north, Oso Bay on the west, the Laguna Madre on the east and the King Ranch to the south. South Padre Island Drive crosses Flour Bluff, dividing it into an upper part, commonly known as North Bluff, (mostly occupied by Corpus Christi Naval Air Station), and a lower part, commonly known as South Bluff. The area is mostly made up of suburban development, with a population consisting mostly of lower-middle income families, with local and national businesses such as Walmart, H-E-B grocery stores, etc.
Overview.
What is now Flour Bluff Drive was once a railroad branch going off Texas Mexican Railway to the Naval Air Station. Waldron Field, located on the south side of Flour Bluff, was built during World War II and since then has been used as a Navy landing airfield. One can commonly see the orange and white training planes flying around the area. Of historical interest: President George H. W. Bush was relocated at the Navy base for training classes in 1942. Future Senator John McCain crashed a training airplane there in 1965. 
According to the Historical Marker located on SH 358 eastbound, near Laguna Shores Road, just west of the JFK Memorial causeway.
In the spring of 1838 France blockaded the coast of Mexico during the Pastry War, so-called because of the alleged mistreatment of French citizens, including pastry chefs, living in Mexico. The strategic location of Corpus Christi Bay led to the revival of smuggling in this area. Supplies were carried overland across the Rio Grande, and the illicit trade flourished as Mexico bought sorely needed goods in Texas. Although president Sam Houston did not wish to antagonize Mexico, Mexican patrols at Corpus Christi offended many Texans. In July, 1838, authorities at Texana, Texas heard reports of Mexican activity near the bay. A captured Mexican sea captain said that his government had declared Corpus Christi a port of entry and had dispatched about 400 men to protect it. A summons was issued, calling Texans to rally at Texana, August 7, to drive the invaders from the Republic's boundaries. By the time the volunteers reached the area, some of the Mexicans had landed their supplies near the tip of Corpus Christi Bay and returned to Matamoros. The rest scattered, leaving about 100 barrels of flour and parts of a steam engine. The Texans confiscated the usable flour, and other contraband, and the site became known as Flour Bluff.
Education.
Flour Bluff is home to the Flour Bluff Independent School District.
Recreation.
Flour Bluff is bordered on the East by the Laguna Madre, renowned for its fine Red Drum, (or Redfish) and Trout fishing.
One of Flour Bluff's many parks, Waldron Park, is also the site of a 9 hole disc golf course.

Education reforms on the Isle of Wight

Education reforms on the Isle of Wight is part of a process to change the Isle of Wight's education from a three-tier system to a two-tier system. The debate as to how this should occur was first started in 2004, lasting until 2008. Three options were put forward at the start of 2008 as to what kind of education system would be best to move forward with. However as all included the closure of large numbers of island schools, they produced a negative reaction with many local islanders, resulting in protests occurring in the main towns of Newport, Ryde, Shanklin and Sandown. A final decision was made in May, announcing which schools would be closed. The decision was made based on all three options put forward, instead of going down one definite path. The reforms were first implemented in September 2008, with everything aimed at completion by September 2010.
History.
In 2004, the Isle of Wight Council undertook a consultative process aimed at changing local education structure, to a two tier school system which would bring the island in line with the rest of the country. The move was opposed by a lobby known as Standards not Tiers based in Upper Ventnor and the Conservatives, who, after they won the local council elections in May 2005 shelved the proposals pending further investigation.
The Annual Performance Assessment of the Isle of Wight Council's Education and Children's Social Care Services 2005, carried out by Office for Standards in Education and the Commission for Social Care Inspection, found low levels of achievements for pupils in schools and a lack of significant and sustained progress over the last five years. Overall, the Isle of Wight Council’s capacity to improve its services for children and young people was judged to be 'adequate', out of the four ratings 'very good', 'promising', 'adequate' or 'inadequate'.
In 2006, the regional Learning and Skills Council proposed an option which meant replacing the secondary schools' sixth forms with central provision at the Isle of Wight College. In January 2007, the authority rejected this proposal, and instead offered its own, which included a reduced number of secondary schools and the retention of Year 9 pupils in Middle schools, extending their range to form 9–14 schools and 14–19 provision at High Schools, an arrangement adopted nowhere else in the United Kingdom.
The debate took on new urgency at the start of 2008, when three 'key options' were put forward by the Isle of Wight Council for public consultation, each of which meant the closure of at least half of the Island's primary schools. On 14 January 2008, the Council announced that at least 23 primary schools and one middle school (expected to be Nodehill Middle School) would be closed, whichever education pathway was chosen in March.
Options.
Three main options were put forward at the start of 2008, with an option being chosen in March 2008. Under the options at least half the Island's existing primary schools would be closed. Twenty-three primaries and one middle school whichever option was taken.
The Isle of Wight Council says it could save up to £2 million a year in money that would be spent on small primary schools, that under the new system, wouldn't be needed. The changes will begin to be introduced from September 2008, with the final changes complete by September 2010.
Protests.
The 'biggest protest the Island has ever seen' occurred outside County Hall in Newport on 26 January 2008 at 10:00am lasting an hour until 11:00am, led by Isle of Wight Radio DJ Alex Dyke as a result of the Council's plans for education reforms. Between 1,000 and 1,250 took part in the protest, including parents, teachers and students. The Island MP Andrew Turner, with two other councillors also attended the protest, disagreeing with the plans.
Later protests also occurred at Shanklin through the leader of the Isle of Wight Council, Councillor David Pugh's ward, with a silent march through the town. Later protests occurred at Sandown and Ryde, with a final protest taking place again in Newport.
Final Decision.
It was finally announced on 23 May 2008 which schools would be closed. The final decision took parts of all three options, bringing the island into line with the rest of England with a two-tier system. Three primary schools will close completely, with 15 others no longer operating on their current sites. St Helens Primary, Chale CE Primary, and Weston Primary School were all announced to be closing completely, while others are amalgamated onto existing primary or middle school sites.
As a two-tier system requires no middle schools, by September 2010 there will be 38 primary schools in total and six high schools. The sites of existing middle schools will either be used for new amalgamated primary schools or new sites for high schools. Forelands Middle School and Nodehill Middle School are currently the only middle school sites which will have no use after their closure.
Implementation.
The first stages of implementation took place in September 2008, with the final stages aimed at being complete by September 2010. This involved ABK Middle School and Trinity Middle School merging to form Christ the King College. Although the site currently only takes years 5–8, by the time the system is fully implemented it will take a full age range. Kitbridge Middle School also merged with Downside Middle School. So far, two headteachers from both Medina High School and Cowes High School have announced they will be stepping down before the start of the new term in September, stating the education reforms as an influence to their decision.

Robert Clark Morgan

Captain Robert Clark Morgan was the captain of the ship that brought the first settlers to South Australia in the "Duke of York" in 1836. The diaries that he kept are held in the collection of the State Library of New South Wales. His life as a whaling captain has been recorded in a book titled 'The Man Who Hunted Whales' by Dorothy M Heinrich.
His birth.
Morgan was born on 13 March 1798 at Deptford, Kent in England. This is recorded in his diary. His parentage is not known. No conclusive record of his birth has been found.
In his diary he does not mention his parentage apart from a few cryptic remarks. On Sunday 5 February 1837 he states, “I could not say that I had a praying Father or a praying mother or a Brother or Sister for I lost them young and knew little of them. I was cast on the world at the age of 11 years to walk the journey of life”.
In one of his diaries he speaks of his Father’s sister dying and being buried on 2 April 1844. However, he does not give her name. There was a Harriet Morgan, a single woman aged 68, who was buried in St Dunstan's, Stepney on 2 April 1844. She died on 29 March 1844 at 5 Arbor Street West, St Thomas, Mile End Old Town in Stepney, where the death was registered. The informant was a Charlotte Willoughby of Charles Street, St. George East, Stepney.
In Harriet’s Will, dated 25 February 1843, she states that her address (at that date) was 3 Leg Alley, Long Acre (now known as Langley Court off Long Acre), and that her “wearing apparel” is to be divided between her two sisters Louisa Johnson and Jane Brooks and that both sisters resided at 3 Leg Alley, Long Acre. She also left to her brother (this could have been Robert Clark Morgan’s father or his father's brother) Thomas Morgan living at 5 Ward Street Lambeth her writing equipment.
His religious awakening.
When a young man, and just appointed to his first command, he, about ten days before sailing on his cruise, happened to enter a chapel in Greenwich where a revival service was being held, and the result to him was eventful. This would have been in 1828.
That revival service in Greenwich was led by Isaac English (baker and lay preacher). English is listed in Pigot's Commercial Directory of Kent of 1827/8 and in 1839 and Robson's Directory of 1838 at 12 Blissett Street in Greenwich. In Bagshaw's 1847 directory he is recorded as Isaac English, Gentleman at 34 Prior Street, Greenwich. In the 1841 census for Greenwich he is shown at Blissett Street with the following entry. Isaac English, age 45, baker. Not born in the county Maria or Miriam English, age 40 [his wife born in the county. Also in the house are: James Earl, age 25, baker, John Mulin, age 15, baker and Ann Cracknell, age 9. English could not be found on the 1851 census for Greenwich.
Before he took up his first command in December 1828 on the Sir Charles Price he had hitherto been a reckless, boisterous profligate, living without a thought of God, except to blaspheme his holy name; but Divine grace now wrought so wondrous a change in him, that when he once more went to sea the old hands amongst his crew could scarcely recognise him for the same man. He who once never gave a command unaccompanied by an oath was now never heard to swear; and such was the force of his character and the power of his example, that in a few months' time not a man of his crew dared to use a profane expression while within his hearing. The discipline of the ship was not a bit lessened, and every one was happier, from the sobriety and good feeling of which the captain set example.
Robert Clark Morgan attended the West Greenwich Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, which was founded in King George Street (song), very close to Blissett Street, in 1816. A new chapel was built in London Street (now Greenwich High Road) in 1876, rebuilt in 1906 and destroyed in the Second World War in 1940. The present church building was put up in 1953. However, it is no longer a church and it’s used as offices.
The foundation stone of the Wesleyan Chapel in George Street was laid in September 1816 and it was opened on December sixteenth of the same year. It was capable of seating 1,000 people. The building may still be there although it has not been used as a chapel for a very long time.
Wife and family.
On 30 December 1822, at Deptford, Kent, at the Church of St. Nicholas, Robert Clark Morgan married Mary Dorrington. He was 25 and she was 22. He had a lifelong devotion to her. He states that they met when very young - the choice of my youth is an expression he often used in his diaries.
The marriage was registered as:
“Robert Morgan Clark, bachelor of this Parish and Mary Dorrington, spinster of ('this', written, then deleted) the Parish of Greenwich were married in this Church by Banns this 30th Day of December in the Year one thousand eight hundred and twenty two, by me, D. Jones, Curate.
This Marriage was solemnised between us (signed:) Robert Morgan Clark
Mary Dorrington
In the presence of { X The mark of James Gittens and
The reason his marriage was solemnised in the surname of Clark is unknown.
They had seven children, most dying shortly after birth. There was a daughter, Louisa Clark Morgan, who died at 7 years of age and only one child, also named Robert Clark Morgan, survived the Captain and his wife. Both were baptised at the George St Wesleyan.
The Royal Navy.
He entered the Royal Navy at the age of eleven, his diaries state that at that age (he was) sent to sea on board a man o' war. He talks of the man o' war as "a place where all wickedness is committed with greediness and a place where he saw every vice man is capable of committing".
South Sea whaling.
When he left the Royal Navy, in 1814 towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he transferred to the merchant marine, whaling. He began as an apprentice on the Phoenix (of London), becoming an able seaman and rising to first and second Mate and became a Master at an early age. One of the voyages on the "Phoenix (of London)" is described in the book The Dalton Journal edited by Niel Gunson. Captain Morgan is not mentioned by name. However, there is a reference to the second mate, which Captain Morgan would have been at that time.
He was the master of the ships Sir Charles Price and Recovery, both owned by Daniel Bennett an owner of many south sea whaling ships and the "Duke of York", owned by the South Australian Company, the first pioneer ship to reach South Australia.
His whaling career was in the "Phoenix (of London)", Apprentice June 1814 - June 1819, Able Seaman June 1819 - Sept 1822, second Mate Jan 1823 - Nov 1825, first Mate May 1826 - Sept 1828. "Sir Charles Price", Master Dec 1828 - June 1831. "Recovery", Master Dec 1831 - June 1835. "Duke of York (Ship)" Master Feb 1836 - Aug 1837.
In his diary later in life he reminisces about his whaling experiences:
"Early this morning I went on deck. It was a fine beautiful morning, a clear atmosphere and fine blue sky with the ocean with only a few rippling over its surface. I saw a ship and went to the masthead and saw she had her boats down. Afterwards I saw the sperm whales she was after. She had taken whales before as she was boiling oil and the smoke was going in volleys from her tryworks. The whales were going as nearly as fast as the ship so we kept pace with them for 2 - 3 hours till at last one boat struck a large whale then another struck the same whale and eventually killed it and took it alongside.
Oh how vivid did this bring back all my past experience in this work. The days of my youth and manhood was spent in this trade. This was the part of it I loved. A sight of a whale would make my heart jump and take away all relish for food. How happy if when a boy I could get to be let down in a boat and after I came to manhood how happy if I could but get to kill a whale and I always managed to get my share. All these things came fresh to my memory and these feelings rose up and caused a feeling not easily described, but I left it all for Jesus and his work. I will not repine how many hairs breaths escapes have I had in whaling, how many times has God spared my life when my boat has been staven, time after time."
South Australia.
Captain Morgan was appointed Master of the "Duke of York" by George Fife Angas. The Duke of York was owned by the South Australian Company and was fitted out for the Australian run to take the first settlers to South Australia and then whaling after that. This vessel sailed from St Katharine Docks on 26 February 1836. The 190 ton Duke of York was a whaling and trading bark owned by the South Australia Company. She was under the command of Captain Robert Clark Morgan and left London on 24 February 1836, equipped for whaling. (Another source said she left England on 5 April). She reached Kangaroo Island on 27, July 1836.
After a historic meeting at Exeter Hall on 30 June 1834, where the principles, objects, plan and prospects of the New Colony of South Australia were explained to the public, hundreds of enquiries from prospective immigrants started to arrive at the South Australian Association's rooms at 7 John Street, Adelphi.
The Company dispatched the "Duke of York", the "Lady Mary Pelham", the "Emma" and the "John Pirie", with the intention of commencing whaling operations on Kangaroo Island - a known safe harbour. The "Duke of York" finally set sail for the sea on Saturday 19 March 1836, having been unable to get away from the English coast due to bad weather for some five weeks. It carried 42 persons including the crew.
Under the emigration scheme, labouring classes received a free passage. They had to be between 15 and 30 years of age, preferably married and needed two references. Steerage passengers paid £15-20, middle berth £35-40, cabin class £70. Children under 14 years were charged £3 while those under 1 year were free.
Although the ships had been assessed for their suitability to convey immigrants, the captain was responsible for their welfare once on board.
All emigration to South Australia was voluntary - remarkable also for the high percentage of women and children who arrived on the first fleet.
The 9 ships to arrive in South Australia in 1836 landed:- 343 males, 164 females and 129 children - total 636. Their average age was only 19 years of age.
Some passengers, including some adults whose passage was charged to the Emigration Fund, were on board as well. The First Report of the Commissioners of Colonisation of South Australia gave the ship's complement as thirty-eight. A list compiled from the Company's records gave the names of twenty passengers and twenty-six seamen, in addition to the Captain.
Several of the passengers listed had significant appointments in the service of the South Australian Company. Samuel Stephens was the first Colonial Manager, and on behalf of his employers, he established the settlement of Kingscote as a site for their projected whaling venture. From its location in relation to the mouth of the River Murray, and the Gulfs of St Vincent and Spencer, he considered it as a possible shipping port for the future.
Another of the passengers, Thomas H. Beare, was Superintendent of Buildings and Labourers, while D.H. Schreyvogel was engaged as a clerk. Chas. Powell and W. West were gardeners; Henry Mitchell was a butcher; and John Neale was an assistant carpenter.
They reached Kangaroo Island in South Australia and disembarked on 27 July 1836. When in sight of the island the previous evening Captain Morgan, a devout Wesleyan, gathered the passengers for a prayer meeting. When they landed Mr. Stevens, the man in charge of the South Australian Company, named the river Morgan, after Captain Morgan. It is now called Cygnet. Soon after landing he conducted a short service to give thanks for their safe arrival. This was probably the first religious service on the shores of South Australia.
Most of the passengers wished to be the first to land in the new colony, but Captain Morgan settled the dispute very cleverly. He instructed the second mate Robert Russell to have some sailors row the youngest, two and a half year old Elizabeth Beare, daughter of the Company's Deputy Manager, Thomas Hudson Beare as close as possible to the shore. Then Russell was to carry her through the shallow water and place her feet on the beach while the adults were at dinner. In doing so she was the first white female to set foot on that strand. When this happened the crew began to cheer and the passengers soon realised that a landing had been made without them knowing it.
Leaving the passengers on Kangaroo Island, the Duke of York sailed off on 20 September 1836 to hunt whales. They called at Hobart Town from 27 September 1836 to 18 October 1836 to refresh and to proceed to the South Sea whaling grounds. On Friday, 10 February 1837 they heard of the wreck of the ship Active in the Fiji Islands and they took on board its Master, Captain Dixon, Willings the mate, and Wilkey.
They were whaling up the coast of Queensland when they were shipwrecked off Port Curtis (in Queensland) on 14 July 1837. Port Curtis is near current day Gladstone, Queensland. The whole Ships Company was saved and got into 3 boats and rowed and sailed 300 miles to Brisbane, where they arrived Saturday 26 August 1837 after a most uncomfortable time. On the way down aboriginals killed an English crewman George Glansford, of Barking Essex and a Rotumah native boy, named Bob, when the boats put in for water. There are parts of his diary that related to George's death. The Captain said that he was a young man, probably, early 20's. The Captain used to get George down to his cabin for religious instruction. He said that he recalled the Captain writing that George was not a hardened rough type. George apparently accepted his religious teaching. It seems as the captain had a sought of parental role over George.
His journal that covers the period that he was master of the Duke of York is water marked to attest to this experience. They finally arrive at Morton Bay and the steamer James Watt took Captain Morgan, the Mate and nineteen survivors on to Sydney, leaving the remainder to follow in another vessel.
London Missionary Society.
On Tuesday, 6 February 1838, three days after he arrived home from Sydney, he visited the Secretary of the London Missionary Society to see if he could take command of the Missionary Ship Camden. On the tenth he met John Williams (missionary) who was looking to travel back to Samoa.
John Williams was a missionary and with his wife Mary went out to the islands in the South Pacific to take the Christian message. They had a very interesting time and their mission was fraught with danger. John was eventually murdered. In 1936 the London Missionary Society invited children all over the country to save their ship halfpennies and contribute to buying a ship in John's memory so that his work could continue. Several ships were bought in this way and PILOTS came into being.
He sailed for the London Missionary Society in the Pacific, in firstly the Camden, from April 1838 till July 1843. He was with the Rev. John Williams, when he and Harris were murdered in the New Hebrides Erromango, now Vanuatu.
In 1839, when the Camden returned to England, he became captain of the London Missionary Society's mission ship, John Williams (ship), and sailed it for 3 voyages; June 1844 - May 1847, October 1847 - May 1850 and the last was July 1851 to June 1855.
In 1841 the Samoan Brethren suggested that he sit for his portrait when next in Sydney. However, it was finally done in London. The original artwork is held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England and was displayed in the offices of the London Missionary Society. There was a copy reproduced in the journal the Congregationalist (June 1962 at p. 3) with an article about him.
Retirement from the sea.
Captain Morgan retired from the sea at the end of the voyage in 1855.
As far as can be seen in his diary that covers the period from 16 June 1861 - 29 March 1862 he spent a lot of his time visiting the sick.
His final diary that covers the period 15 March 1863 to 31 March 1864 tells of the voyage the Captain and Mrs Morgan made to Melbourne, Australia on the "Yorkshire" from about 30 March 1863 to l9 June 1863. It appears they came to be near their only surviving child (Robert Clark Morgan II). The son was baptised on 10 July 1829 at the Wesleyan Chapel George St. Greenwich. In the 1851 census Robert Clark Morgan II (aged 21) was residing in England with his patents at 83A Lower Road Deptford (also in the household was Mary A Wallace, niece, aged 22, born in Greenwich, Kent). His occupation is shown as a Clerk at the East India Docks. He had lived in Samoa with his parents for a while and went to Sydney in 1849. He then went to Melbourne arriving in about 1852 at the time of the gold rush. He joined the Victorian civil service on 20 September 1852 as a Revenue Collector. He died in Melbourne, Australia at the age of 87 years a very wealthy man.
Death.
Morgan died 23 September 1864 at Arthur St, South Yarra, Victoria, Australia, at the home of his son, aged 66.
His dying words are that when he was asked by his son if he wanted anything was: “I want more love, more love to the Father, more love to the Son and more love to the Holy Spirit".
The headstone reads:
Sacred to the memory of Robert Clark Morgan who died 23 September 1864, aged 66. He brought the first settlers to South Australia in the Duke of York in 1836 and was subsequently Commander of the London Missionary Ships Society's Camden and John Williams. His consecrated life made him a true Missionary and he was much beloved by the natives of the South Pacific. So he bringeth them into their desired heven.
And on the other side of the headstone –
Also of Mary his beloved wife who died 12 February 1866 aged 64 years, and their daughter Maria Clark who died 18 October 1843, aged 7 years. Precious the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints
The Reverend A.W. Murray in his book, Forty Years Mission Work, said "I have known many eminent Christians during my not-short life, but I have never met a more lovable, a more Christian like man than was Captain Morgan"
On 12 February 1866, Mary Morgan (née Dorrington) his wife, died at Arthur Street.
On her death certificate it said she was born at Greenwich, Kent. Mary and her husband Captain Morgan are buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery with their son Robert Clark Morgan II and his wife Martha Jane (née Short).

Vector Unit

Vector Unit is a video game developer founded in December 2007 by Ralf Knoesel and Matt Small. The company is best known for its title, "Hydro Thunder Hurricane", released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade in 2010.
History.
Vector Unit was founded in December 2007 by Ralf Knoesel and Matt Small. The two originally worked together on "Blood Wake" at Stormfront Studios. Following "Blood Wake", Small took a job with EA Redwood Shores. Knoesel and Small kept in contact, and started a small side project. One night Small received a message from Knoesel which read "So I've been having these thoughts... about quitting and doing the small games thing." The two decided to quit their job and begin their studio. Vector Unit was incorporated January 28, 2008.
Although officially the company consists of only two employees, a team of five contractors were brought in to complete their first title, "Hydro Thunder Hurricane". Creative Director Matt Small was interviewed on the difficulties off starting a new company by Gamasutra in April 2010. Small noted that with a small team members are required to take on multiple roles. "You get to choose at least 80 percent of the time which hats you wear, and then sometimes you end up forced into wearing a particular hat."
Technology.
Vector Unit uses a proprietary engine known as the Vector Engine to develop their games. The engine allows for real time "baking" of assets; when assets are first run in the game, they are optimized for that particular platform. Visual scripting is used to allow editors to write scripted events without a comprehensive understanding of code. FMOD is used for audio and "Bullet Physics Library" handles all in-game physics. 3D models are created in Maya and artists are able to see how the asset would look in-game via a plugin. Level construction and placement of props are done in BarracudaEditor, the team's level design tool. During the development of "Hydro Thunder Hurricane" Vector Unit maintained a PC build of the game which allowed artists and other team members to test their assets in-game without moving to a Xbox 360 Debug Kit.

The Promavia F.1300 Jet Squalus, also known as Promavia Jet Squalus F1300, was a two-seat light jet trainer designed by Italian Stelio Frati and built by Promavia in Belgium with support from the Belgian government. 
Development.
The Jet Squalus was designed by Frati and based on his earlier lightweight jet trainers the F.5 Trento and the F.400 Cobra. It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable landing gear. The Jet Squalus was powered by a Garrett TFE109 turbofan with engine intakes in above the wing root. The prototype, registered "I-SQAL", first flew on 30 April 1987. The aircraft was fitted with four underwing hard points for disposable stores to allow weapons training. 
Operational history.
With the demise of the similar American Fairchild T-46 trainer in 1986 the support for the engine disappeared and it was planned to re-engine with the Williams-Rolls FJ44. The aircraft was exhibited at the Farnborough Air Show in September 1988, but the project folded and Promavia went bankrupt in 1998. An unflown second prototype was to be modified for airline pilot training, and the unfinished third prototype was to be pressurised.

Robert Carter (ballet dancer)

Robert Carter is an Internationally known African-American primo donna ballet dancer for the famous Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, or "Trocks". He is perhaps the best known drag ballet dancer in the world who is currently performing as of late 2008. As a lead dancer and its most senior member, Carter is the public face of the all-male dance troupe, granting many interviews and garnering significant international reviews. A full time dancer, he is "paid enough" as a lead dancer, despite being non-union, to avoid having a "side job."
Personas.
Carter has performed female roles under the name of "Olga Supphozova" a "glamorous" and "feisty platinum blonde" who is, in his own words, "fastidiously delicate and pretty." He also performs under the male "persona" known as Yuri Smirnov. As Olga, he claims to have started in a KGB lineup, and as Yuri, he supposedly was in the Kirov Ballet. These personas use "cod-Russian stage names," according to one British critic. The names used by the "Trocks" are "fake ballerina names" that are part of the joke.
Career.
Carter was born and was raised in Charleston, South Carolina. He started dancing at age eight, and first saw the Trocks at age ten, which inspired him to dance like them, "en pointe", at age eleven or twelve. He trained at the Ivey Ballet School and the Joffrey Ballet School. He performed with a number of dance groups, including the Florence Civic Ballet, Bay Ballet Theater, and the Dance Theater of Harlem.
Carter joined the "Trocks" in 1995. He started with "the easier stuff" like "Go for Barocco", followed by "harder stuff" such as "Paquita" and "Swan Lake", especially works by Balanchine.
Dancing with the Trocks, was his life dream, says Carter:
Accolades and criticism.
Carter has received many kudos from significant critics. These include Jennifer Dunning and Gia Kourlas of the "New York Times", Robert Gottlieb of "The New York Observer", Joan Acocella of "The New Yorker", Sanjoy Roy of "The Guardian", and Susan Reiter of "Newsday". ABC News said, "And it's more than just hilarious -- it's hilariously impressive."

Responsible Government Association

The Responsible Government Association (RGA), called the Rhodesia Party from 1923, was a political party in Southern Rhodesia. Founded in 1917, it initially advocated responsible government for Southern Rhodesia within the British Empire, as opposed to incorporation into the Union of South Africa. When responsible government was achieved in 1923, the party became the governing Rhodesia Party. It endured until 1934, when it merged with the right wing of the Reform Party to create the United Party, which remained in power for 28 years afterwards, and was itself defunct by 1965.
History.
Responsible Government Association (1917–23).
Led by Sir Charles Coghlan, a South African-born Bulawayo lawyer, the RGA was formed in 1917, and fought the 1920 election to the colony's Legislative Council. The party's main platform was one in favour of responsible government for Southern Rhodesia within the British Empire, and against incorporation into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910 by the British South Africa Act, 1909. In this campaign the RGA was allied to the Labour Party, whilst its main opponents were the Unionists, who advocated integration into South Africa. A government referendum was organised in 1922, and responsible government won the day. Southern Rhodesia was duly made self-governing and semi-independent within the Empire in October 1923.
Rhodesia Party (1923–34).
Coghlan became the first Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and the party continued as the Rhodesia Party, which had a broader base of support, including a number of former unionists in its cabinet. It remained in power until September 1933, when the party narrowly topped the popular vote, but lost the election, winning only nine of the 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the Reform Party was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including the new prime minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the Rhodesia Party merged with the Reform Party's more rightist members in 1934 to form the United Party.
Legacy.
With Huggins at the helm, the United Party roundly defeated the rump left wing of the Reform Party in an election held the same year. The United Party thereafter remained in government for nearly three decades, with Huggins leading it until his retirment in 1956. The party renamed itself the United Rhodesia Party in 1953, soon after Southern Rhodesia was federated with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and merged with the Federal Party in 1958 to become the United Federal Party. It was removed from power by the Rhodesian Front's 1962 electoral victory, and was inactive by 1965.

Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2008

Elections for the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir were held over seven days in November and December 2008. The previous government led by the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party (PDP) in coalition with the Indian National Congress (INC) collapsed when the PDP withdrew. Following the election, the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (NC) agreed a coalition with Congress and their leader, Omar Abdullah became the state's youngest ever Chief Minister at 38.
Background.
Elections for the Jammu and Kashmir state Assembly were due in 2008, following the end of the term of the Assembly elected in 2002. However the PDP withdrew from the INC-led state government in protest at the Amarnath land transfer decision. The INC government resigned in July 2008 and the state was brought under direct rule of the central government pending the elections.
Boycott.
The main Kashmiri separatist group, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference called on Kashmiris to boycott the elections, saying the elections were a ""futile exercise"" that would never ""fulfill the aspirations of the people"".
Despite these boycott calls, NC leaders claimed that activists from Jamaat-e-Islami had comeout and voted for the PDP.
There were scattered separatist protests throughout the elections, including hundreds who protested in Srinagar. Police prevented these protestors from marching to the centre of the city which led to protestors throwing stones at the police who fired tear gas and used baton charges.
Security.
Indian election officials voiced major concerns about the security of the elections given the calls for boycott and protest from separatist leaders and the recent violence over the Amarnath land transfer controversy. Voting was staggered so that security forces could maintain control. Thousands of security forces were deployed during the voting. In Srinagar, security forces were posted at junctions, patrolled the streets and guarded polling stations. An unofficial curfew was enforced, gatherings of more than five people banned and neighbourhoods were sealed off with steel barricades and razor wire. 
Police also arrested three men they accused of being Jaish-e-Mohammed members planning suicide attacks in Jammu. One of those arrested was a soldier in the Army of Pakistan, who Pakistan said had deserted in 2006. However following the polls the NC leader, Farooq Abdullah, thanked the Pakistan government for their ""non-interference"" with the polls.
Results.
The seven stages of the elections were held as follows:
Turnout rose by 17%, despite calls from Kashmiri separatists and Pakistan for Kashmiris to boycott the election. INC head Sonia Gandhi described the polls as ""a triumph of Indian democracy"".
Separatist supporters were said to have backed the PDP. The BJP's increase in support was said to be due to polarisation arising from the Amarnath land transfer controversy.
1,354 candidates stood for election including 517 independents and nominees from 43 political parties.
Government formation.
Former National Conference Chief Minister, Farooq Abdullah, said he did not want to return as it ""required the energy of a younger man"", and nominated his son, Omar Abdullah, and the head of the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference instead.
Congress debated forming a coalition with either Conference or the PDP. It was reported that the PDP had offered to support a Congress candidate for Chief Minister if they joined with them. However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chairperson Sonia Gandhi were reported to favour the largest party to ""honour the mandate"" of the election.
On 30 December Congress and the National Conference agreed to form a coalition government, with Omar Adbullah as Chief Minister.

Peter Josie

Peter Josie is an inactive Saint Lucia politician. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 1982 and again from 1987 to 1997.
Career.
The firebrand leftist Peter Josie was an attendee at the famous but secret meeting of leftist minds on the minuscule Rat Island in 1970, which included members of Grenada's future revolutionary leadership. At the time governments were suspicious of the motives of these new entrants into the political fray. So fearful were they that they banned the revolutionaries from entering several territories. In one such case on April 16, 1970 S.R. Slater, the Minister of Home Affairs in St Vincent deemed Josie, together with other activists as Dave Darbeau, Geddes Granger (now Makandal Daaga) and Robert "Bobby" Clarke, to be a prohibited immigrant.
He served from 1974 to 1982 as a Member of Parliament for Castries East on the ticket of the Saint Lucia Labour Party. He began his career as Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries and then Minister of Foreign Affairs. After the ill-fated Labour Government fell, he led it unsuccessfully in the General Elections of 1982. He continued with the party and won his seat as an MP for Vieux Fort South in 1987.
He had originally entered the political sphere as a black power proponent and member of the St Lucia Forum, together with other well known political figures such as Hilford Deterville, Julian Hunte and George Odlum, which addressed mainly urban St Lucia on a new radical platform for St Lucia's development. It was with the latter he was always associated as they led an agricultural workers trade union and galvanised the then marginalised rural farm labourers. 
He was a major player in the ill fated Labour Party government which was riven by internal wrangling when it formed the government during the abbreviated term between 1979-1982. Odlum and Josie were to fall out in spectacular fashion as they acrimoniously parted ways before the fall of the government.
He was thrown out of the Labour Party in 1988 after campaigning against then leader Julian Hunte for the post of political leader. He switched allegiance to the ruling United Workers Party and became one of its two Ministers with responsibility for Agriculture.
He failed to retain his seat in the 1997 General Elections and in 2001 he failed again at the hustings this time in his old stomping grounds, Castries East on the platform of the National Front. He last appeared at the hustings when he campaigned for Richard Frederick in the by-election of 2005 and the General Elections of 2006.
On February 11, 2012 Josie launched his autobiography, Shattered Dreams at the Bay Gardens Hotel

2009 mid-year rugby union tests

The 2010 mid-year rugby union tests (also known as the Summer Internationals in the Northern Hemisphere) refers to the rugby union Internationals played from 23 May to 4 July 2009, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere.
The main event in the series was the Lions tour of South Africa, which involved three test matches, while France and Italy travelled to Oceania.
For Australia, New Zealand and South Africa the Tests also constituted preparation for the 2009 Tri Nations. There was also a short tour for the Barbarians, including their first ever match in Australia. The two main North American sides, Canada and the United States, used the series as preparation for their annual early-summer competition, the Churchill Cup, and for their 2011 Rugby World Cup qualifying tie in July.
South Africa attempted to schedule two warm-ups for the Springboks before the Lions tour; however, only one eventually materialised, and it was not a full Test. Initial plans were that the Boks would play a late May test against neighbours Namibia at Windhoek, to be followed by a match in Soweto with New Zealand Māori. The Windhoek match morphed into a fixture between a South Africa XV and a "Namibian Invitational XV" made up mostly of South Africans, including five Springboks, won 36–7 by the South Africa XV on 29 May. The New Zealand Māori match went from a Springboks match to a South Africa XV match before being scrapped because the South African Rugby Union could not find sponsorship or a venue.
With the Lions tour taking place in South Africa, three of the four individual home unions fielded weakened, experimental sides in their matches, with Scotland not playing in this series. England played home friendlies against the Barbarians and Argentina and then travelled to Argentina for a return match with the "Pumas", while Ireland and Wales went to North America. The first England-Argentina matchup was notable because the Argentine Rugby Union moved the game to England in effort to raise cash to help support their fledgling professional setup; the move was also convenient for their large contingent of European-based players. Argentina also played a match with the touring French Barbarians; while it was not an official Test, the "Pumas" fielded a mostly first-choice side.

Quality by Design

Quality by Design (QbD) is a concept first outlined by quality expert Joseph M. Juran in publications, most notably Juran on Quality by Design. Juran believed that quality could be planned, and that most quality crises and problems relate to the way in which quality was planned.
While Quality by Design principles have been used to advance product and process quality in every industry, and particularly the automotive industry, they have most recently been adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a vehicle for the transformation of how drugs are discovered, developed, and commercially manufactured.
Pharmaceutical quality by design.
The FDA imperative is outlined in its report “Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach.”
In the past few years, the agency has implemented the concepts of QbD into its pre-market processes. The focus of this concept is that quality should be built into a product with an understanding of the product and process by which it is developed and manufactured along with a knowledge of the risks involved in manufacturing the product and how best to mitigate those risks. This is a successor to the "quality by QC" (or "quality after design") approach that the companies have taken up until 1990s.
The QbD initiative, which originated from the Office of Biotechnology Products (OBP), attempts to provide guidance on pharmaceutical development to facilitate design of products and processes that maximizes the product’s efficacy and safety profile while enhancing product manufacturability.
QbD activities within FDA.
The following activities are guiding the implementation of QbD:
While QbD will provide better design predictions, there is also a recognition that industrial scale-up and commercial manufacturing experience provides knowledge about the process and the raw materials used therein. FDA's release of the Process Validation guidance in January 2011 notes the need for companies to continue benefiting from knowledge gained, and continually improve throughout the process lifecycle by making adaptations to assure root causes of manufacturing problems are corrected.
ICH activities.
Working with regulators in the European Union (the European Medicines Agency) and Japan, FDA has been furthered Quality by Design objectives through the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. ICH guidelines Q8 (on Pharmaceutical Development), Q9 (on Quality Risk Management), and Q10 (on Pharmaceutical Quality System) provide some assistance for manufacturers to implement Quality by Design into their own operations. The ICH Steering Committee meets twice a year to discuss the progress of its efforts. This practical input should help ensure that quality risk management and knowledge management are used to make lifecycle adaptations that maintain process control and product quality.

Bryan Lobb

Bryan Lobb (1931– died 3 May 2000 Glastonbury, Somerset) was a first-class cricketer who played once for Warwickshire and then more than 100 times for Somerset.
Style and personality.
born 11 January 1931 in Bournville, Birmingham, Lobb was a tall gangling right-arm fast-medium bowler and a No 11 batsman. His fielding was the subject of amusement: "He changed course a dozen times while the ball trickled straight to him at long-leg," wrote Somerset's historian, David Foot. His batting reflected the fact that, in Foot's words, "he turned ungainliness into an art form" and he was also a poor judge of a run. In Lobb's obituary in Wisden in 2001, the story of a run-out at Chesterfield is told by Lobb himself: "I once got run out by deep mid-on, who overtook me as I unwisely strolled to the other end".
But his bowling was no joke. From a long run-up, he got inswinging movement through the air and bounce from the pitch, all delivered with a flurry of arms and legs and fair hair.
Cricket career.
His one match for Warwickshire came in 1953 and brought him two wickets but no contract. He arrived in the West Country in 1955 with Somerset's cricket at a low ebb: bottom of the County Championship for the preceding three seasons and with bowling largely dependent on spin. He went straight into the first team for the first match of the season and stayed there, winning his county cap in his first season. Wisden reported that he "appeared to be the best discovery made by Somerset for some years and he headed his county's bowling with 86 wickets at 25.59 each". In all matches he took 90 wickets. Somerset still finished at the foot of the Championship table, however.
Signs of improvement for the team as a whole came in 1956, with a rise to 15th place out of 17. In a wet summer, Lobb's swing and seam bowling was less effective and Wisden noted that he "would have been more effective with a reliable new-ball partner". He still took 82 wickets at an average of 26.75; Somerset's other non-spin bowlers managed only 38 Championship wickets between them.
The 1957 season was Lobb's best: in all matches, he took 110 wickets, becoming the first Somerset pace bowler to achieve that feat since the Second World War. The average too, at 19.48 runs per wicket, was much reduced. Against Cambridge University he took seven for 63 and four for 23 for the best match figures of his career.
In 1958, Lobb produced both the finest bowling and batting performances of his career. At Bath against Yorkshire he reached the for-him dizzy heights of 42 in a last wicket stand of 84 with Geoff Lomax. Then at Lord's against Middlesex he took seven wickets for 43 runs on a pitch that Wisden called "difficult". By the end of July, he had taken 51 first-class wickets at an average of 21.78. But there his season ended, through injury.
Though Lobb played in the first few Somerset matches of the 1959 season, he was from this point onwards essentially a part-time cricketer, his career interrupted first by his studies at St Luke's College, Exeter and then by his career as a schoolmaster at the Edgarley Hall prep school which is attached to Millfield School. He played a few games in 1960, reappeared in 1963, then again in 1967 and 1969. As late as 1979 he was involved in warm-up matches for the Sri Lankans in advance of the ICC Trophy. He died 3 May 2000 Glastonbury, Somerset.

Jan C. A. Boeyens (born 1934) is a South African chemist.
Boeyens was educated at the University of Pretoria. 1965 he worked in the National Physics Research Laboratory of South Africa, 1965 in Stanford. 1981 he became a professor of chemistry at the University of the Witwatersrand, in 1991 dean of the faculty of science of this university.
He has written or co-written more than 600 scientific contributions. Some of his books are used as textbooks of theoretical chemistry all over the world.
As an emeritus he wrote books neglecting the scientific consensus about the adequacy of quantum mechanics. He claims to be able to establish more accurate modern physics and chemistry without using higher mathematics by using some elementary number theory. He references the numerological idea of the “prime number cross” invented by the German chemist and author Peter Plichta.
Quotes.
Numerologists can interpret great historical and cosmic events, predict the future and explain human nature.
Volumes have been written about the red herring known as Schrödinger’s cat. Without science writers looking for sensation, it is difficult to see how such nonsense could ever become a topic for serious scientific discussion.
All advances in chemistry happen at the bench, as it should, but without the theoretical understanding, even of common events such as intramolecular rearrangement. No calculation can predict chemical reactions.
It is a myth that chemistry derives from quantum theory. More fundamental than both is the periodic table that reduces the properties of matter to a number basis, which is revealed only peripherally in the differential equations of quantum theory.

"How do you start over once you have betrayed a nation's trust?" The news of Hansie Cronjé's involvement with Indian bookmakers and his resulting public confession rocked the international sporting community. An unprecedented rise to glory was followed by the most horrific fall. A tarnished hero fueled the nation's fury. Hansie, once South African cricket's golden boy, had been stripped of everything he had held dear: a glorious captaincy, the support of his former team mates and the respect of a nation. In its place the stinging rejection of cricket administrators and the humiliating dissection of his life on international television, made his retreat into depression inevitable. Hansie's bravest moment in finally confessing his involvement with bookies had suddenly become a tightening noose around his neck.

American Football League (1934)

The 1934 edition of the American Football League was a short-lived minor professional football league with teams based in the American South and Southwest. The first of several minor leagues with the same name, the 1934 was also one of the first involving teams not located in the American Midwest and East. While its membership was the cornerstone of American football in the southern U.S. (with several having beaten National Football League teams on the gridiron), the AFL had only one season of competition and folded after cancelling competition in the 1935 season.
Participating teams.
Charlotte Bantams. Formed in 1932 and playing primarily teams based along the Atlantic Coast, the Bantams amassed a 10-3 record in 1933.
Dallas Rams. Founded in 1933 with the expressed purpose of joining the new AFL as a natural rival of teams in Oklahoma City and Houston, the Rams played only three games that year. One unique fact about the Rams was that as of November 1934, they were owned by a woman: Glyma Orr, identified in print as "a young society woman" from Dallas, who had also been a former head cheerleader and was a devoted football fan. When not running the team, she ran a school of dramatic arts. The press reported that she was believed to be the first woman to ever own a football team. 
Louisville Bourbons. Founded in 1931, the Bourbons played primarily against opponents in the Midwest, including the Portsmouth Spartans of the NFL.
Memphis Tigers. Formed in 1927 as "New Bry’s Hurricanes" and renamed in 1928, the Tigers were the dominant football team of the South from 1929 to 1932. In 1929, Memphis defeated the Green Bay Packers 20-7 (the Packers eventually won the 1929 NFL championship without losing a league game).
St. Louis Blues. Formed by the league after the St. Louis Gunners rejected the league's overtures for membership. Sports promoter Bud Yates was credited with founding the team after being general manager for the 1926-27 St. Louis Blues independent team (which lost only one game in its two-season existence). and founding crosstown rivals St. Louis Gunners (in 1931) 
and St. Louis Veterans (in 1932). When the Gunners joined the NFL in November 1934, the Blues moved to Kansas City.
Tulsa Oilers. Formed in late 1933 as the Tulsa Drillers, the team played (and lost) only three games that season (two against Oklahoma City, one against the St. Louis Gunners). Coached by Billy Boehm, the team featured former members of the Tulsa University football team.
Teams who joined the league but were forced out.
Oklahoma City Chiefs. Formed in 1932, the Chiefs lost only one game in their inaugural year (to Portsmouth) and continued their success in 1933 as they staked their claim as being one of the two strongest minor league teams (along with the St. Louis Gunners). Because their home stadium could seat only 2000 people, the league dropped the Chiefs when the team’s efforts to secure a "suitable" stadium. The team ceased to exist two months later.
Houston. Having joined the league despite not having a team organization or player roster, Houston was dropped when Oklahoma City was given the boot. The team never came into existence.
Origin of league.
After the collapse of the first American Football League and the paring of ten teams from the NFL after the 1926 season, professional American football was concentrated in the American Midwest and Northeast. The Memphis Tigers developed into a strong independent football team, comparable to those based in Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
In 1929, a Memphis team that was temporarily enhanced by the addition of Ken Strong and several other NFL players defeated the Green Bay Packers. The victory prompted Tigers owner S. A. Goodman to claim the "national pro championship." Memphis was not seriously challenged by non-NFL teams in 1930, but in 1931, promoter Bud Yates founded the St. Louis Gunners with future Hall of Fame member Jimmy Conzelman as the team’s coach. After a respectable 5-2-1 record in 1931 (playing all of its games at Public Schools Stadium in St. Louis), the Gunners changed coaches (to Bullet Baker) and played a more ambitious schedule in 1932, playing the Tigers to one win, one loss, and one tie – a November 27, 1932, game between the two teams was billed as for the "independent pro championship" ended with a 0-0 score.
The 1931 season saw the start of the Louisville Bantams, which played most of the games in its inaugural season against teams based in Ohio (including the Ironton Tanks); the following season saw the formation of the Charlotte Bantams and the Oklahoma City Chiefs. By 1933, both Charlotte and Oklahoma City were not only able to compete toe-to-toe with Memphis and the St. Louis Gunners, but both dominated the Tigers in three out of four games that year.
On November 14, 1933, Memphis Tigers owner S. A. Goodman, boasting that the Tigers have been playing "as good football as in the NFL" and that St. Louis and Oklahoma City "could win… in the NFL at any time," announced plans for a new major football league, which he named the American Football League. In the three weeks after the announcement, the Gunners defeated NFL teams in successive games and a new team in Tulsa, the Drillers, came into being and played competitively against Oklahoma City and St. Louis, losing all three of their games.
Formation.
In 1933, Goodman stated "We don’t want a Southern league, nor a secondary league." Yet by the summer of 1934, his new league was to have teams representing Memphis (Tigers), St. Louis (Gunners), Oklahoma City (Chiefs), Tulsa (the newly renamed Oilers), Charlotte (Bantams), Louisville (Bourbons), Dallas, and Houston. Even then, plans for the league had to be altered as neither Dallas nor Houston had organized teams at that point… and the Gunners did not want to join the embryonic league as they had aspirations for joining the NFL (in fact, the team bought the NFL’s Cincinnati Reds franchise for $20,000 on August 8, 1934, but the sale was vetoed by the NFL team owners).
In August, Oklahoma City was expelled from the league because their home stadium (a minor league baseball park) could hold only 2000 people in the grandstands (the Chiefs would continue as an independent team for two more months before folding); at the same time, Houston was dropped from the lineup as there was no progress in organizing a football team in time for the start of the season. On the other hand Dallas "was" successful in forming a new team, the Rams. Also in August, Bud Yates (founder of the St. Louis Gunners in 1931 and the St. Louis Veterans in 1932) was enlisted to organize a third St. Louis team, this time called the St. Louis Blues, which featured former Gunners Dick Frahm and John Breidenstein.
Competition and dissolution.
By October 7, 1934, the day of the league's first games, the AFL settled on a double round robin schedule, with each team scheduled to play one road game and one home game against each of the other members of the league. Despite the league's intention, only Memphis and Charlotte managed to play the full ten games as weather forced the cancellation of several games.
Final league standings – 1934
By late October, the Blues' supremacy was virtually conceded as St. Louis was not only dominating each of its games but also outdrawing the Gunners, which had to cobble together a schedule after the rejection by the NFL and the reduction of availability of AFL members for scheduled football games. When the Gunners’ purchase of the Cincinnati Reds was finally approved by the NFL, Blues' ownership decided not to compete with the newest member of the National Football League and opted to move across the state of Missouri, to Kansas City, one-time home of the NFL's Kansas City Blues and Kansas City Cowboys. After the move, the former St. Louis Blues became the new Kansas City Blues.
The St. Louis/Kansas City Blues ran roughshod through the league, with only a tie with Memphis marring its won-lost record with a late-season tie. On December 16, 1934, the Blues finally met the Gunners for the first (and only) time, with the NFL team prevailing 7-0 before it was disbanded due to unpaid tax debts (a new St. Louis Gunners team would surface by later 1935, again as an independent).
Preparations for the 1935 season saw the Blues returning to St. Louis after the Gunners' dissolution and Louisville playing exhibition games in September, but none of the other league members had bothered to assemble their squads, including the Tigers, which were sited in the league's home city, Memphis. S. A. Goodman, both the president of the AFL and the owner of the Tigers, announced on September 26, 1935, that due to "lateness in organizing", the 1935 AFL season was cancelled, but the league would return in 1936. 
St. Louis and Louisville played four games in front of diminishing crowds before folding; the Memphis squad was tentatively put together by two longtime Tigers (Red Clavette and Cliff Norvell) and bankrolled by Wilson Murrah. While the team managed to play three games (scoring 100 points in the process), the writing was on the wall: the Tigers (and any possibility of the AFL returning in 1936) winked out of existence.
All-League teams.
Despite the AFL’s existing for only one season, it had two All-League teams, one selected by Associated Press writers in the cities represented by the AFL teams and one selected by the coaches of the American Football League.
AFL All-League team (selected by coaches).

Michael Paton

Michael Paton (born 25 March 1989) is a Scottish professional footballer who is currently playing for Queen of the South.
Club career.
Paton, a striker born in Greenock, is a product of Aberdeen's youth academy. He first played senior first team football with Scottish Second Division club Brechin City, whom he joined on loan in January to June 2008. He rejoined the Glebe Park side for another loan spell in September 2008
He made his Aberdeen debut in December 2008, coming on as a substitute in a 3–0 victory over Inverness Caledonian Thistle. He scored his first senior goal for the club in a 2–1 loss to Rangers at Ibrox in May 2009.
Paton became a regular for the Dons in the 2009–2010 season. He managed his first double for the club coming off the bench in a 3–2 defeat to Dundee at Dens Park in the quarter final of Scottish League Cup. He set up Lee Miller to score the only goal in Aberdeen's 1–0 win over Rangers at Pittodrie Stadium. The following month, Paton signed a three-year contract extension to keep him at the club until 2013.
In the January transfer window, he was linked with a loan move with Dundee but to no avail and stayed at Aberdeen. Paton scored his second league goal for Aberdeen against Hibernian at Easter Road, on 10 February 2010 and his first goal at Pittodrie three days later against Celtic, with a superb left foot strike from the edge of the box.
The next season, Paton playing time was soon reduced, due to arrival of new striker, especially Scott Vernon. Paton missed out a loan move to Morton & Dundee, insisting he wants to fight for the first team at Aberdeen. In his first appearance of the season, Paton received a straight red card – for the first time of his career – for stamping on Jonny Hayes in a 2–0 loss against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. His red card appeal for three match ban was reserved by the SFA and was successfully rescind, making him return to a next match.
On 30 November 2010, Paton travelled to Austria for a three-day trial at Austrian Bundesliga side Fußballclub Wacker Innsbruck with the aim of winning a short-term loan deal in the following transfer window. The loan deal was not concluded.
He was offered a free transfer by Aberdeen during the summer 2011 transfer window, but opted to remain with the club. At the end of the transfer window, on 31 August 2011, he joined Stockport County on a six-month loan. He made his debut, receiving a yellow during the match, in a 1–1 draw against Telford United. Having featured five games, Paton scored his first goal, on 1 October 2011, in a 2–1 loss against York City. Two weeks later, on 11 October 2011, he scored a brace in a 4–3 loss against Darlington He would one more goal against Bath City and also provided assist for Nick Chadwick in a 2–0 win. He returned to his parent club at the end of November after sustaining an injury.
On 31 August 2012, Paton was released by Aberdeen. His release left him gutted after he was surplus to requirements at Aberdeen. Meanwhile, manager Craig Brown says Paton's released from Aberdeen was lack of scoring was the main factor of him leaving the club.
On 28 February 2013 Paton signed for Queen of the South until the end of the season. Paton had been on trial at the club and had played three times in the reserves as a trialist. It was also his first club in six months. On 22 May 2013 Paton extended his contract at Queens until 31 May 2014. 
Controversy.
On 7 October 2010, Paton and then colleague Zander Diamond were alleged to have made disparaging comments about Protestants on the social networking site Facebook. Both players later apologised and were subsequently censured by Aberdeen.

Stratford-upon-Avon Parkway railway station

Stratford-upon-Avon Parkway is a parkway railway station in Bishopton, in the north of Stratford-upon-Avon, England.
It is located on the Birmingham to Stratford Line, adjacent to the A46, part of the strategic road network. The close proximity to the road is intended to draw in longer distance passengers who wish to commute into the West Midlands conurbation, easing congestion.
The station makes use of the Park and Ride facilities at Bishopton, with a large car park (which can accommodate up to 725 vehicles), thus saving people from driving into central Stratford to get the train from the existing Stratford station. It has two platforms on the existing double tracked line. Each platform is 153 metres long with an additional 5-metre stopping allowance to accommodate a maximum of six 24.5 m car trains. The platforms are linked by a DDA compliant footbridge with ramps. 
In July 2011 the scheme secured a £5 million government grant from the UK Government's Local Sustainable Transport Fund. In September 2011 Warwickshire County Council agreed a further £1.8 million of the projected £8.8 million cost of the scheme. In January 2012 Warwickshire County Council announced that Mott MacDonald had been appointed to produce the 'GRIP4' outline design of the parkway station by early summer 2012. 
The station was originally planned to open in December 2013, but opened seven months ahead of time on 19 May 2013. Construction work started on 17 October 2012.

Series.
Daredevil Noir.
One night, Daredevil infiltrates a building where the Kingpin is expecting him. The two confront each other and discuss what has happened in the past week involving Orville Halloran. In his childhood, Matt Murdock was blinded by his father's assassin who brutally slammed his head into a brick wall, leaving him blind. Though he did wish to become a lawyer, his impoverished lifestyle denied it, leaving him to be a performer instead, under the name Daredevil. Later he took to the streets as a vigilante, killing criminals to avenge those they killed. Matt now works with Foggy Nelson and was in his office until one afternoon a woman named Eliza entered the room and offered a way to bring down Halloran. When she left the office, Foggy has doubts and turns to Matt, but Matt convinced him that she's telling the truth and left the office to investigate. Meanwhile Fisk is with Halloran in a restaurant discussing about the identity of Daredevil being Jack Murdock's son.
However one night, a police officer sees three cars, two being police cars and one being the gangster's car, and witnesses five men being killed by the Bullseye Killer and believe that he's one of Halloran's men. Back in the office, both Foggy and Matt discuss Halloran making his move against Fisk, and Matt worries that Eliza will be caught in the middle of it. When Foggy said that Eliza mentioned Halloran putting money on Matt's father throwing the fight on the night he was killed, Matt left the office to find out. Matt went to a bar called Dilooly and met with Eliza there to confirm what Eliza said to Foggy was true about his father, which she did confirm and told Matt not to do anything that would get him killed. When Matt was walking on the street he heard a woman scream, which he quickly dressed up in his Daredevil uniform and apprehended the assailant, however it was revealed to be a setup by Wilson Fisk who wanted to meet him and revealed that Halloran was the one who killed his father.
The next night, Matt followed Eliza around the city to look over her, but suddenly a fight broke out in the "Landmark Inn" were a bar-tender revealed that the Bullseye Killer was here before dying. With no sign of Eliza and Hell's Kitchen being threatened, Matt went throughout the city to find the whereabouts of Halloran from his men. He went back to Foggy's office to reveal that he knows where Halloran is and plans to get Eliza back, but Foggy has doubts about if Matt ever had her. Matt went to the harbor and found Halloran there, who was expecting him to arrive. Matt figured out that Halloran killed his father and told Fisk, who then told him about it, which would lead Matt coming to him. However what shocked him is that Eliza was there, who was surprised that she can lie to him, but what surprised Matt is that Halloran revealed that Eliza is the Bullseye Killer. Surprised by the news, Matt figured out that she is one of Fisk's employers, which Halloran refused to believe until Eliza killed him.
With Halloran dead and Eliza killing the rest of Halloran's men, the two fought constantly, with Eliza gaining the upper hand, but Matt eagerly charged into her but both landed into the sea. This made Eliza unable to throw well, which gave Matt an advantage as he began to strangle her to death with a chain and Eliza trying to fight back until she was unconscious, but Matt could not finish her off because he still loved her and dragged her back to the surface. The Police arrived and Matt left, leaving Eliza in police custody. Matt returned to Foggy's office and revealed to him that Eliza was the Bullseye Killer, which surprised him, but also revealed that he could not kill her because he still has feelings for her. Foggy comforts him until Matt decides to go after Fisk. Returning to the present, Matt and Fisk end their discussion and the series ends with the two beginning to fight each other.
Deadpool Pulp.
Wade Wilson is a Canadian citizen who joins the OSS during WW2. Though not America and Canada already being at war with the Axis powers, his superiors describe him as 'a patriot', even if he is "missing a couple screws, and then some." While fighting in the Pacific with Merrill's Marauders, Wilson is captured by Japanese forces. Transported to a POW camp on mainland Japan, Wade is subjected to torture and interrogation daily for nearly a full year. It is assumed this is the source of his mental break with reality. Being left to drown, hung by his thumbs in a quickly rising river, Wade manages to escape by removing one of his thumbs. Sneaking into camp, he steals the mask and katana swords of his torturer. Donning the mask, he stabs the soldier to death and escapes with another mysterious prisoner. They leap off a cliff and to safety.
Years later, Wade and the mysterious other prisoner (who turns out to be Cable) are working under the jurisdiction of J. Edgar Hoover, Wade as an operative and Cable as an executive officer along with General Stryfe. Set during the 1950s, the storyline follows an early Cold War plot to attack America.
The story begins with rogue CIA agent Outlaw (Inez Temple) stealing a powerful briefcase nuke from a CIA protection team. Discussing the matter, Cable suggests Wade Wilson as the man capable of getting the nuke back. He is recalled from operations on South East Asia, where he was doing a good imitation of 'The Deer Hunter'. On his return, Wade is interviewed by a shrink. We discover that Wade is afflicted by two conflicting voices in his head, which he makes light of by saying "We all have our Jiminy Cricket, don't we?" We also find out that Wade did not join the US Army out of patriotism, but because "I like to kill people and the U.S Government was smart enough to give me a license to." He also created an alternative personality called 'Deadpool' in addition to the two voices he hears. The psychiatrist states that 'Deadpool' is a method of dealing with the torture he endured by becoming the monster he feared most. Though the doctor's professional opinion is that Wade is a "bonafide psychotic, with multiple personality disorders {...} He is a danger to society and should be institutionalized immediately." Cable disagrees, saying he "needs a nut to catch a nut." Wade is subsequently assigned the liquidation of Outlaw.
The first part of his mission is to find the missing scientist Dr. Jack Hammer who worked on the nuke. Unfortunately Outlaw finds him first and kidnaps Dr. Hammer, leaving Wade a note pinned to the wall. The two agents meet at a dinner club for a meeting. The story reveals that the two had a romantic relationship in the past but they are unable to reach an understanding and their dance turns into a gunfight and a chase through the streets of New Orleans. 
Back at Dr. Hammer's apartment, Wade sifts through clues left behind. Outlaw has not killed the doctor, but instead removed him to Cuba. Traveling to Havana, Wade meets his underworld contact Meyer Lansky as his home. While the family enjoys their Sabbath upstairs, Meyer leads Wade downstairs to where Meyer's men are interrogating Dr. Hammer's pimp. Together they find the doctor's location and Wade heads there. As they near the location, Wade feels something familiar about the landscape around him. He is ambushed by Cubans. He is grazed in the head by a .22 caliber round and collapses. 
As he awakes, Wade is confronted by Stryfe and the brainwashed sleeper agent Cable. Unwittingly, Wade has stumbled into a plot to begin World War 3. Furthermore, Wade was not captured by the Japanese as previously believed. He was kidnapped for Stryfe's secret program to turn him into a deadly sleeper agent. The camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was where he was taken after 'capture'. Stryfe himself was Wade's torturer. As with Cable, Wade was programmed to obey orders without question after the coded phrase "Sic transit gloria mundi" was spoken aloud. 
With both Cable and Wade under his control, Stryfe begins to outline his plans for America, beginning with the assassination of John F Kennedy. As the general is briefing the agents, Wade's inner voices are in turmoil. Another third (or possibly fourth) personality has arisen. "There's someone else in here with us." Is how the 'white-box voice' describes it. A third caption box appears in the panels following; black with white lettering, it seems to be the 'voice' of Wade's programming. Somehow, either from the recent head wound or from living with the more familiar personalities for so long, Wade manages to overthrow his brainwashing and foils Stryfe. The general orders Cable to "KILL HIM, CABLE! KILL DEADPOOL!" Acting quickly Wades disables Cable before he can attack. This gives Wade time to give Stryfe his mask back (with the assistance of a desk stapler).
Cable awakes with only his orders to "KILL DEADPOOL" intact. He leaps onto the general and begins to pound on him until Stryfe gives up the coded phrase to de-program an agent; "Joe DiMaggio." Wade explains the situation to a baffled Cable, and the two leave to stop Outlaw at last. Along the way, Cable and Deadpool extract their revenge on General Stryfe.
Wade meets Outlaw once again on top of the Statue of Liberty during the 4th of July celebration. Believing her to be one of Stryfe's agents, Wade tries to convince Outlaw that she was tricked and used. In return, he tells him she was never a sleeper agent and explains "{...} Baby, I'm just bad." as she cuffs him to the armed briefcase nuke, which is in turn cuffed to the railing around the Statue's observation deck. With twenty-two minutes until detonation, Wade breaks the railing and dives over the edge in pursuit of Outlaw. They come to a final showdown in the wheelhouse of a boat they fell near. Wade cuffs the briefcase to Outlaw's wrist, dooming them both. Taking the device as far out to sea as possible once rendering Outlaw unconscious, Wade realizes they will not get far enough away. Wrapping the cuffs around an anchor on deck, he plunges again into the water to drown himself, the nuke, and Outlaw. As she drowns, the key to the handcuffs floats up from around her neck. Wade escapes just in time, and the nuke detonates deep underwater. 
Wade survives the blast, but the resulting radiation poisoning causes an extreme strain of cancer. Wade is left scarred and with only days to live. Cable and a man with a Maple Leaf flag on his lapel approach Deadpool in his hospital bed to tell him of an experimental program that could cure him: Weapon X. Wade responds with a smile and tells Cable "You got my attention."
Iron Man Noir.
During his latest expedition- accompanied by his aid James Rhodes, his assistant and lover Doctor Gialetta Nefaria, and Virgil Munsey, his chronicler for "Marvels: A Magazine of Men's Adventure"-, adventurer Tony Stark discovers a cavern with a mysterious emerald mask in it. However, his attempts to claim the mask are interrupted when Gialetta reveals that she has betrayed him to aid the Nazis, in the form of the mysterious "Baron Zemo" and the ruthless Baron Strucker, the Nazis killing Virgil before Tony and Rhodes escape by starting a fire. Returning to America- where they meet their new chronicler Pepper Potts, who writes under the alias of 'Frank Finlay'-, Tony reveals that his father, Howard Stark, vanished years ago, and that he is suffering from a weak heart due to unspecified damage, requiring an electrical support.
Investigating Gialetta's desk, Tony discovers a journal hinting at the location of Atlantis, setting out on a trip with Captain Namor in his ship, the "Dorma", in the hopes that he will discover Atlantis's mythical power source, orichalcum- a metal said to enhance power- to use it to repair his heart. While they recover a trident-head made of orichalcum from an underwater cavern, the "Dorma" is subsequently attacked by Zemo's forces- Gialetta now wearing the mask to hide the scars she received in the initial escape-, Zemo escaping with Pepper as a hostage, forcing Tony, Rhodes and Namor to retreat to the ship's submarine, subsequently being picked up by Jarvis in an airship. Despite the increased damage to his heart, Tony decides to attempt to rescue Pepper using suits of armour he has developed based on some of his father's old sketches and ideas, attacking the Nazis in their castle base. 
However, their rescue attempt takes a shocking turn when they fnd themselves facing an identical suit of armour, with Zemo unmasking to reveal his true identity of Howard Stark; 'Zemo' is merely a title passed down to subjects who have been brainwashed by a unique chemical formula that leaves them loyal to the Nazis. Despite facing an army equipped with similar armors, Tony manages to destroy the Nazi army by supercharging the trident with the last dregs of his repulsor's energy, triggering an electric burst that destroys the air fleet. Returning home, Tony decides to abandon adventure and focus on making the world safer by eliminating real threats.
Luke Cage Noir.
Luke Cage is a Harlem man who gains a reputation for being the bulletproof "Power Man" after attacking a corrupt police office and being shot without any apparent injuries. After serving ten years behind bars for the fight, he returns home to a changed Harlem in a very segregated America during Prohibition.
Cage finds that an old friend of his, Willis Stryker, has become a major player in New York's underworld through bootlegging and other rackets. He goes to Stryker's nightclub seeking information on his pre-incarceration girlfriend Josephine Hall. Stryker tells him that Josephine died in an apartment fire, but Cage is quietly suspicious. Stryker offers Cage a job, and is further impressed by Cage's handling of a vengeful pimp.
After leaving the nightclub, he is invited into a limousine by a wealthy white man named Randall Banticoff. He also offers Cage a job, in this case the investigation of his wife's murder in Harlem. Cage accepts in exchange for the clearing of his criminal record. He gains admission to the city morgue and sees through bloating that the wife has been dead longer than has been reported.
Still bothered by Stryker's story, Cage goes to the cemetery and digs up Josephine's grave. He opens her coffin and finds it empty. He also sees a man named Tombstone standing over him with a shotgun and a pack of dogs.
Punisher Noir.
The story begins in 1935 Manhattan with an unknown man, later to be identified as Frank Castle, waking up and turning on his radio, during which he is seen with several bullet marks across his back. In the following scenes, a radio broadcast airs detailing a lone vigilante, all the while the still unnamed man gets dressed, which includes preparing a couple grenades, knives, brass knuckles, and two pistols with the Punisher skull on them. Just as the man dons a mask with the same skull, the radio broadcast identifies the lone vigilante as the Punisher.
Flashbacks detail Frank Castle's actions during the first World War, and provide the story behind the Punisher's famous logo. The logo was Frank's way of 'taking the piss' out of his wife's fear that he would be claimed by the angel of death. Frank Sr. is shown to be a skilled soldier, taking out an entire trench of Germans with a pair of pistols (the same pistols his son is seen using). After the war, he is traveling on a train, when he is ambushed by Noir's version of the Russian. After a brutal fight which takes Frank and the Russian onto the roof of the train, Frank manages to defeat the Russian by slipping a live grenade down his pants and kicking him off the train.
In 1928, Frank's wife has died of cancer, and he is left to raise their son on his own. Frank teaches his son much of his combat knowledge, teaching the boy to shoot a gun and explaining the ins and outs of combat. Frank also refuses to pay protection money to the local crime boss (Dutch Schultz), earning the crime boss' wrath. Frank falls in with a gang of bullies, but eventually leaves the gang after refusing to rob a Church. Frank, however, is killed by a trio of hitmen hired by Dutch: Noir's version of Jigsaw, Barracuda, and a mystery assassin referred to as "She." Upon learning of his father's murder, Frank Jr. swears revenge on all those responsible.
Returning to 1935, Frank (this version's Punisher, as opposed to the mainstream's continuity where the father is), is shown systematically hunting down those responsible for his father's death. He first ambushes Barracuda at a carnival after-hours. After failing to learn the identity of "She" from Barracuda, he executes him. Frank Jr. then allows himself to be subdued by Jigsaw. Jigsaw tortures Frank Jr., carving the image of the skull into his chest with a knife (which resembles the tattoo that his father had received during the war). In a moment of hubris, Jigsaw reveals the identity of "She." Frank Jr. then reveals he had freed himself of his restraints hours ago, and proceeds to strangle Jigsaw.
"She" is in fact the Russian. The grenade's explosion had in fact castrated him, but taking this in stride, the Russian began wearing a wig and dress. The Punisher confronts the Russian at the Bronx Zoo. After a long fight, the Punisher finally kills the Russian. Throwing his mask onto the Russian's corpse (framing the Russian for the murders), Frank guns down Dutch Schultz, before retiring into the night. Detective Martin Soap (who in this incarnation is much more competent than his mainstream counterpart), deduces that the Russian was not the Punisher, because Schultz was killed several hours after the Russian's body was discovered. This leaves the Punisher's identity a mystery to the police.
Frank, left without purpose after exacting his revenge, walks the streets. In a conversation with his father's tombstone, he asks if he should move on to "Luciano" or "Capone", if he should continue to "punish". Frank receives his answer from a newspaper article, where Adolf Hitler's picture is seen.
Note: This version of the Punisher is not as restrained as the mainstream Punisher. He (accidentally) kills a prostitute when trying to kill Barracuda. He also contemplates murdering Soap only because Soap might get in the way of his vengeance.
Spider-Man Noir.
This alternative take on the Spider-Man mythos is set in 1933 – during the Great Depression. While Peter Parker still becomes the titular Spider-Man, the initial focus of the story is upon Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich. He is an experienced and respected reporter who runs a network of informants under the alias of the Spider. The Goblin is a crime lord whose henchmen consist of the Enforcers (consisting of Ox, Fancy Dan, Montana), Kraven, the Chameleon (a master of disguise) and the Vulture (a sideshow freak who had developed a taste for human meat). Urich does not use the information he has to expose the Goblin but rather to blackmail him, in order to get enough money to feed his secret drug habit.
Urich encounters Peter Parker during an oration by Peter’s aunt in Central Park. The socialist slant of May Parker’s words does not sit well with the Enforcers and Urich is forced to intervene in order to prevent serious injury to either Peter or May. Urich subsequently takes Peter under his wing and after Peter mistakenly receives a tip-off meant for the Spider, the young man ventures to a warehouse where the Goblin’s men are unloading a shipment of stolen antiques. A particular antique – a spider statue – breaks open and releases a horde of spiders. One of the spiders bites Peter, causing him to pass out and dream of a spider god. When he awakes, he is upside-down in a black web. He has gained the proportionate strength, speed and agility of a spider, along with a spider-sense and the ability to spray organic webbing from his hands. Unlike the traditional Spider-Man, he cannot cling to walls by force of will and his webbing does not focus into web-lines that he can use for travel; instead, he uses his acrobatic agility to maneuver about the rooftops and uses his webbing as nets to both stun and capture his enemies. With his powers, Peter dons a black mask, gloves, and trench coat in order to take down Osborn in the guise of the Spider-Man. He also brings a gun.
In order to censor the Daily Bugle, Osborn kidnaps the editor J. Jonah Jameson and has the Chameleon assume his place. The Chameleon-as-Jameson then goes to Urich’s apartment and shoots him, unaware that Felicia Hardy – owner of the Black Cat club – is witness to the murder. Felicia later goes to the Daily Bugle offices and kills the Chameleon, leaving his body to be discovered by Spider-Man shortly before the arrival of the police. Spider-Man escapes the attentions of the police and confronts Osborn, having dispatched all of his henchmen in turn. During their fight, it is revealed that Osborn is a former circus freak himself who hides his goblin-like visage behind one of the Chameleon’s masks. After Spider-Man refuses to kill Osborn, the spider-infested and barely still alive body of Kraven appears and attacks the Goblin, killing him.
Later, Spider-Man visits Felicia, who reveals that she had once had a relationship with The Goblin. Spider-Man reveals himself to be Peter in front of her, and she asks why he's there. Peter hands her a photo Urich had in his files earlier of him and Felicia. Spider-Man then jumps out the window, and swings away, leaving Felicia behind.
Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face.
1934, NYC: Peter Parker, Spider-Man, has a new problem: The Crime Master, a masked criminal who has taken over as the city’s crime boss. As he investigates, his relationship with Felicia Hardy, owner of The Black Cat speakeasy, develops… He returns home to find Joe and Robbie Robertson talking with Aunt May. As a struggling black reporter, Robbie asks Peter to set up a meeting with Doctor Otto Octavius who is experimenting on Ellis Island. A few days later they meet with him and learn that he is experimenting on monkeys to understand more about the human mind. Octavius himself is wheelchair bound but employs controlled robotic arms, attached to the back of his chair, to help him. After they leave, Robbie suggests the story is deeper… That night a delivery of black slaves are delivered to Ellis Island.
Spider-Man takes the fight to The Crime Master and busts up an operation of drinking, girls and drugs. In a back room he discovers a soundproof torture chamber. He goes to visit Felicia, but she is with someone else… Returning home, he is told that Robbie has disappeared. On Ellis Island, Octavius inspects the new lab rats and Robbie is among them. Octavius, working for The Friends of New Germany, intends to use them to prove that inferior races can be controlled by removing their willpower surgically. Spider-Man revisits the chamber for more information, but he is ambushed by The Crime Master and his men. With them is The Sandman who slams Spider-Man to the ground with ease.
The police, led by Jean DeWolff, arrive too late to save Spider-Man from a massive beating but in time to kill Sandman. The Crime Master escapes, but Spider-Man has managed to link him with The Friends Of New Germany. A severely injured Spider-Man goes to Felicia to recover… The following day she kicks him out as her other man calls: the unmasked Crime Master. Felicia questions him too much and he works out that she has been seeing Spider-Man. In fury, he attacks her with a shard of mirror. He gets a call from the leader of TFONG, telling him to shut Ellis Island down before they all get caught. Spider-Man goes to Ellis Island himself and finds Robbie, but was too late as Octavius had already drilled into his frontal lobe, leaving him motionless.
The Crime Master arrives and starts destroying Octavius’ work. Spider-Man drives most of Crime Master’s gang away as Octavius gets his robotic arms on The Crime Master. He slices him apart with scalpels, desperate to save his work. Spider-Man then sets on Octavius for what he has done, crushing his robotic arms. DeWolff arrives before Spider-Man kills him and tells him to thank his girlfriend for calling them in… Spider-Man sees Robbie safe and swings to see Felicia. Her guard tells him that she does not ever want to see him again after she was hurt because of him. A month later, Robbie is looked after by his parents at home, but seeing him like this makes Peter feel guilty and upset. Mary Jane Watson tries to comfort him outside, but he still feels he's losing everybody he cares. Octavius is deported to Germany, where The Nazis think that his disability renders him useless, and Felicia has recovered but wears a Cat mask to cover all the scars on her face.
Weapon X Noir.
Weapon X Noir follows the exploits of Kurt Wagner in his circus days, prior to his meeting up with Charles Xavier.
Wolverine Noir.
The story takes place in New York in 1937, where private detective James Logan has to solve a mysterious case in which he has to face his own dark past as well.
Logan and his partner Dog are sitting in their office as an attractive mysterious woman comes in. She hires them to find out who is following her out of the hotel owned by a man named Creed. Dog thinking it will be no problem takes it from Logan and leaves for Creed's hotel. Last we see of Dog, he is fighting two men asking them where Creed is.
Logan begins to think of his childhood as Dog leaves. His father is a devout and strict preacher who punishes him often.
X-Men Noir.
The X-Men Noir series is notable in that none of the characters have superpowers.
The X-Men of this reality are a group of sociopathic teenagers recruited by discredited psychiatrist Charles Xavier, who ran the "Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters" in Westchester, New York in 1937. There, he took in juvenile delinquents and instead of reforming them, he further trained them in various criminal talents due to his belief that sociopathy was in fact the next state in human behavioral evolution. The paper in which he stated this led to his expulsion from the American Psychological Association and as of the first issue, he is interred at Ryker's Island, awaiting charges after the truth about his reform school was made public. Jean Grey is depicted as the grifter of the X-Men; adept at running scams, she gained a reputation as being able to control the minds of men. In the opening of the series, her body is found washed up near Welfare Island in the East River, covered in slash marks grouped in threes.
Eric Magnisky is the Chief of Detectives in the NYPD Homicide Department, a firm believer in eugenics, and the leader of the secret society that rules over most of the organized crime in the city, the Brotherhood. His son, Peter, a former track star, has just joined Homicide, and his daughter, Wanda, is a spoiled socialite who started a relationship with reporter Thomas Halloway, also known as the Angel, a costumed vigilante. At the same time, she's also involved with Remy LeBeau, a casino owner with connections to Unus the Untouchable, a local crime boss and enemy of Magnus. Also involved is Irish heroin dealer Sean Cassidy, a former inmate of the Welfare Pen and one of Tom's childhood mentors.
The rest of the X-Men, made up by Scott "Cyclops" Summers, Bobby "Iceman" Drake, and Hank "Beast" McCoy, are on the run following the arrest of their mentor. Xavier, who refused to ally his students with Lensherr's Brotherhood, was arrested after one of the X-Men, Warren Worthington III, apparently committed suicide by jumping off the roof thinking he could fly. It's revealed by Iceman that Warren was really thrown off the roof by the Brotherhood when Xavier refused. Magnus, as it turns out, owes most of his success to Sebastian Shaw, the leader of the Hellfire Club who holds nearly the entire city of New York in the palm of his hand, including the mayor, the D.A., and the police department. Lensherr (whose last name is revealed to be Magnus, which the Ellis Island immigration agent misheard as Lensherr), is seeking out Anna-Marie, one of Xavier's students with a talent for mimicry, on behalf of Shaw so that they may use her against Unus in their quest to take complete control of the city's underworld. Also tied up in this tangled web of deceit is Captain Logan, a bootlegger and former flame of Jean, who operates out of Chinatown with his first mate Eugene.
Magnus confronts Anne-Marie on the roof of the police station, but she kills him. The Angel realizes that she is really Jean Grey, who killed the real Anne-Marie Rankin and took her place, because she wanted to avoid being studied by Xavier or exploited by Magnus. She says she knows Tommy cannot kill, but Angel reveals that he is "Robert" Halloway, Tommy's twin brother, and pushes them both off the roof. Cyclops and Tommy commiserate before getting on Logan's boat and heading to Madripoor.
A back-up text story, "The Sentinels", by Bolivar Trask, is a pastiche of period science fiction, presented as though published in a pulp magazine called "Scienti-Fiction". In it, Nimrod, one of a society of genetic supermen called Sentinels, must try and save his beloved, Rachel, from the "muties" who live in the tunnels beneath New New New York. However, Rachel claims not to want to be saved, as the muties have shown her the truth. Nimrod discovers that Dr. Steven Lang, the eugenic engineer who created the Sentinels, was not killed by the muties, but left for dead by the Breeders' Council when he protested that their policies were oppressive and saved by Callisto, Queen of the Muties. More Sentinels led by Bastion invade the tunnels, and Rachel and Lang are killed. Nimrod uses a Phoenix Bomb built by the mad Egyptian En Sabah Nur to destroy the Breeders' Council, but also destroys the whole of New New York, and the muties' tunnels. He and Callisto are the only survivors, and conclude they will have to combine Sentinel and mutie genes "the old fashioned way".
X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain.
Mark of Cain is a direct sequel to X-Men Noir. Professor X has been released from jail. The story finds him and his beloved X-Men and everyone scrambling to locate the Gem of Cyttorak. In the dark and steamy jungles of Madripoor, the flashing claws of Logan, the blazing bullets of Cyclops, and the dashing fists of the Angel met with wave after wave of berserk headhunters, all willing to protect the secrets of the Temple-Tomb of Cyttorak with their lives. The ancient treasure map of mercenary Cain Marko, with its siren-song of the priceless gigantic ruby of the fabled god-king, had lured them only into the icy claws of death.
Reception.
"Daredevil Noir" gained some positive review by fans and critics. The fourth issue was highly praised for both the story and the artwork as Comixtreme.com gave an overall 5 out of

New Ulm Medical Center

New Ulm Medical Center is a not-for-profit hospital and clinic serving the region in and around Brown County in south central Minnesota, United States. New Ulm Medical Center is part of the Allina Hospitals & Clinics health care system. New Ulm Medical Center offers a variety of specialty care including orthopedics, general surgery, bariatrics, psychiatry and pediatrics.
History.
The need for a hospital in the New Ulm, Minnesota area became apparent in 1881, when a tornado killed more than ten people and injured several hundred. Since there was no hospital in the area, the Sisters of Christian Charity School opened their doors to treat the victims of the tornado. Father Berghold, organizer of the Catholic Church, recognized this arrangement was not an adequate long term solution and launched a community campaign to raise money to build a permanent hospital. Berghold succeeded. St. Alexander Hospital, New Ulm Medical Center's oldest ancestor, accepted its first patient on November 1, 1883. 
In the following years, several moves, mergers and name changes ensued. The current New Ulm Medical Center was built in 1962.

Fort Hill Parkway is a prospective new parkway railway station to the east of Birmingham, England. It has yet to be passed and is still in planning stages.
It would be located on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line, and would give the east of Birmingham local commuter trains easing congestion on the roads into the city. The close proximity to the motorways would draw in longer distance passengers who wish to commute into the West Midlands conurbation.
All but one station (Water Orton) has been axed between Tamworth and Birmingham, leaving locals isolated, with no rail link. The station would serve these communities in addition to passengers drawn from the motorway network.
It would provide Park and Ride facilities, with a large car park.

History.
Founded by the Czech Proshek brothers in 1884, the Sofia brewery began producing "Proshekovo Pivo" using Czech brewing practices, leading the beer to be awarded a gold medal at Antwerp in 1891. (Before establishing themselves in central Sofia, the brothers had originally rented a smaller brewery in the nearby village of Knyazhevo.) 
In 1947, the brewery was nationalized by the communist regime and renamed "Vitosha", and the beer was eventually renamed "Sofiisko Pivo". A second factory was built in the nearby village of Gorublyane, and in 1978 the brewery in central Sofia was closed. The company changed its name to "Ariana brewery" in 1996.
In 1997, Ariana was bought out by Heineken, and in 2004 production was moved to the Zagorka brewery. Ariana accounts for 50% of total sales of Zagorka AD. [http://corp.zagorka.bg/?op=page&lan=EN&id=26]

Rabbi Wolf marched in Selma, Ala., for civil rights and he traveled to Washington together with his temple members to protest the Vietnam War. In 1967, FBI agents attended and recorded one of his anti-war sermons.
Congregation Solel established an annual Holocaust remembrance weekends starting in the 1960s, making it one of the first synagogues in the United States to initiate the practice.
He was known for bringing speakers as diverse and contemporary as Rev. Martin Luther King and defendants in the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial.
He believed that "The core teaching of Torah for him had to do with justice, and one sometimes had to speak about that in ways that people didn't care to hear," and that "I am Adonai your God" was not a promise but a challenge to be lived up to every moment in every action."
He allowed his congregation to write its own prayer book and make decisions previously reserved for the rabbi. He capped membership at 400 and banned bar mitzvahs.
Yale.
After leaving Congregation Solel, Rabbi Wolf spent eight years as Jewish chaplain and Hillel director at Yale University, where he could have found an activist compatriot in Rev. William Sloane Coffin, the school's chaplain. In 1975 he was the first official Jewish representative ever invited to the World Council of Churches world assembly in Nairobi, Kenya
He was the founder and leader of the organization for peace in the Middle East Breira, A Project of Concern in Diaspora-Israel Relations, that supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Founded in 1973, the organization dissolved in 1977, having been the target of criticism from pro-Israel groups in the United States.
K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple.
He led K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple in Kenwood, Chicago's oldest Jewish congregation, from 1980 to 2000.
Wolf received a Brotherhood Award for his civil rights work from the National Council of Christians and Jews in 1962. When the same group later gave a humanitarian award to then President Ronald Reagan, Rabbi Wolf returned his award, saying, "If Ronald Reagan is a humanitarian, then I’m not.
Rabbi Wolf celebrated his bar mitzvah at age 83, never having observed the rite at age 13 as Reform Judaism did not practice the ceremony at the time. The rabbi acknowledged that he was nervous about performing in public, as this was the first time he would be chanting the torah. The celebrations included a series of lectures by Wolf and other rabbis.
Rabbi Wolf died at age 84 on December 23, 2008 in Chicago of an apparent heart attack.
On December 6, 2013, a celebration of Rabbi Wolf's fifth Yahrzeit (anniversary of death) was held at K. A. M. Isaiah Israel. A new musical work, "The Age of Catastrophes," by young composer Shawn Allison, was commission for and performed on this occasion. Set for string quartet, mezzo-soprano, baritone, and piano, it also includes extracts from Rabbi Wolf's recorded sermons, which are played through loud speakers positioned around the temple throughout the work's second and third movements. Meanwhile, the singers sing texts from the Book of Isaiah and the Book of Job. The movement's first work asks Israel to ponder its sins. The second movement features a sermon of Rabbi Wolf's about how our era is the Age of Catastrophe, juxtaposed to a contemplative musical setting of part of the book of Job. (The plural "Catastrophes" in the work's title signifies the composer's belief that in our media age catastrophes are around us all the time.) The third movement contains extracts from sermons in which Arnold spoke of inner wholeness and challenged people to "make the world shine" by their own responsible actions. The singers, meanwhile, sing the Isaiah text, "Then shall your light burst through like the dawn." Allison, who is completing a doctoral dissertation supervised by Shulamith Ran, is a challenging composer, and yet the lyrical power of the work and the impact of Arnold's voice led to a prolonged ovation.
Support for Barack Obama.
He was vocal in his support for Barack Obama, whose home is across the street from the K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple where Rabbi Wolf served for decades.
Upon hearing of Rabbi Wolf’s death, President-elect Obama issued a statement, calling the rabbi a "dear friend," whose absence would be deeply felt in his hometown and beyond: "Throughout Chicago and in Jewish homes across our country, Rabbi Wolf’s name is synonymous with service, social action, and the possibility of change".
Rabbi Wolf had supported Obama's campaign for the Illinois Senate in 1996, telling him that "Mr. Obama, someday you will be vice president of the United States". Obama laughed, responding "Why vice president?"

2009 Washington Redskins season

The 2009 Washington Redskins season is the 77th season for the team in the National Football League. They failed to improve upon their 8–8 record from 2008, which resulted in Jim Zorn being fired after two seasons.
Players.
Movement.
The Redskins released linebacker Marcus Washington on February 20, 2009. On February 27, the first day of 2009 free agency, the Redskins made four personnel moves. Five hours into the new free agency period, the team signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with unrestricted free agent Albert Haynesworth. The deal included $41 million guaranteed and could reach $115 million. Haynesworth spent the first seven seasons of his career playing defensive tackle for the Tennessee Titans; the Titans asked the NFL to look into claims that Redskins management tampered with Haynesworth by beginning negotiations with him before the start of the free agent period. The Redskins also released cornerback Shawn Springs; agreed to terms with former Buffalo guard (and previous Redskin) Derrick Dockery on a five-year, $26 million contract with $8.2 million in guaranteed money; and agreed with unrestricted free agent DeAngelo Hall on a new six-year, $54 million contract. Hall's new deal contained $23 million in guaranteed money and had a maximum value of $55 million. Hall and Dockery formally signed their contracts on March 3.
On March 2, 2009, the Redskins released defensive end Jason Taylor after he refused to add a clause to his contract that would have required him to participate in the team's off-season workout program. In the wake of Taylor's release the Redskins re-signed defensive end Phillip Daniels, who had started at left end before a 2008 ACL tear on the first day of training camp led to Taylor's acquisition, and brought back Renaldo Wynn, who had played defensive end for the Redskins between 2002 and 2006. Wynn and Daniels signed one-year, minimum deals on March 24 and April 2, respectively.
In late March and early April 2009, Redskins officials attempted to include starting quarterback Jason Campbell in a trade to acquire Denver Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler; they also attempted to trade Campbell to at least one other team for a second-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. After Cutler was traded to the Chicago Bears on April 2, Redskins head coach Jim Zorn publicly re-asserted his commitment to Campbell.
On Dec. 16 the team announced the selection of Bruce Allen as Executive Vice President of Operations and General Manager, replacing Vinny Cerrato. Allen is the son of former Redskins head coach (1971–77) George Allen and brother of former Virginia Governor and U.S. Senator George Allen.

Ah Ken

Ah Ken (fl. 1858-1896) was a Chinese American businessman and popular figure in Chinatown, Manhattan during the mid-to late 19th century. The first man to permanently immigrate to Chinatown, although Quimbo Appo is claimed to have arrived in the area during the 1840s, Ah Ken resided on Mott Street and eventually founded a successful cigar store on Park Row. He first arrived in New York around 1858 where he was ""probably one of those Chinese mentioned in gossip of the sixties as peddling 'awful' cigars at three cents apiece from little stands along the City Hall park fence - offering a paper spill and a tiny oil lamp as a lighter"" according to author Alvin Harlow in "Old Bowery Days: The Chronicles of a Famous Street" (1931). 
Later immigrants would similarly find work as "cigar men" or carrying billboards and Ah Ken's particular success encouraged cigar makers William Longford, John Occoo and John Ava to also ply their trade in Chinatown eventually forming a monopoly on the cigar trade. It has been speculated that it may have been Ah Ken who kept a small boarding house on lower Mott Street and rented out bunks to the first Chinese immigrants to arrive in Chinatown. It was with the profits he earned as a landlord, earning an average of $100 a month, that he was able to open his Park Row smoke shop around which modern-day Chinatown would grow.

Diego Contento

Diego Armando Valentin Contento (born 1 May 1990) is a German footballer playing for Bayern Munich.
Personal.
Contento's family are from Naples, Italy, and he was named after former SSC Napoli star Diego Armando Maradona. His older brothers Vincenzo and Domenico were previously in Bayern's youth team.
Career.
Contento played for Bayern's first-team in pre-season friendlies in 2009, appearing against the Austrian Bundesliga Champion Red Bull Salzburg as a second-half substitute for Edson Braafheid, and was named on the substitutes' bench for a Bundesliga match against FSV Mainz in August 2009. He was called up to Bayern Munich's squad for the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, where he was assigned the number 26. In January 2010, it was announced that Contento would train with the first-team for the rest of the 2009–10 season, along with reserve team-mates David Alaba and Mehmet Ekici. 
Contento signed his first professional contract with FC Bayern Munich on 13 January 2010. The trio were named on the first-team substitutes' bench for the first time on 10 February 2010, for a DFB-Pokal game against SpVgg Greuther Fürth, and Contento came on in the 59th minute, replacing Anatoliy Tymoshchuk. Contento made his UEFA Champions League debut a week later, coming on as a half time substitute for Daniel Van Buyten in a game against Fiorentina, and the following weekend he made his league debut in the Bavarian Derby against 1. FC Nürnberg, starting in place of the injured Van Buyten.
He was in the starting XI for the next two games against Hamburger SV and 1. FC Köln, but was injured in the latter, and replaced by fellow youth team graduate David Alaba. On 21 April 2010 he was named in the starting line-up for Bayern's UEFA Champions League semi-final first leg against Olympique Lyonnais. On 27 May 2010, Contento signed a contract extension keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2013.
Contento began the 2010–11 season as a starter for Bayern. After five games, he suffered an injury and was sidelined for three weeks. He was unable to reclaim his starting spot until the very end of the season. He was first choice to Andries Jonker, the caretaker manager of Bayern Munich until the end of the 2010–11 league season. On 1 July 2011, Jupp Heynckes was named head coach of Bayern Munich. At the beginning of the new Bundesliga season Heynckes brought in Rafinha for the right back position. Team captain Philipp Lahm changed back to his favoured left side and Contento was mostly relegated to the bench.
International career.
Contento represented Germany at under-17 and under-20 level. He recently expressed his desire to represent Italy rather than Germany at senior level. Contento was called up to the Germany under-21 in September 2010, though he could not make his debut due to an irritation on a toe.

Asplenium trichomanes subsp. coriaceifolium

"Asplenium trichomanes" subsp. "coriaceifolium" is an allotetraploid hybrid fern ( 2n = 144 chromosomes ) of the Aspleniaceae family. It was found for the first time in the Soller Valley in the Serra de Tramuntana of the island of Mallorca, Spain, and described by both Spanish and German botanists at the same time. The Spaniards gave it the name "Asplenium azomanes". 
Its fronds are coriacea as plastic and the rachis is very thick, dark garnet color and brilliance. A typical feature of this fern is the existence of a small atrium at the base of the pinnae medium and lower geared towards the apex of the frond with one or two sori in its underside. Sporulation occurs from October to March.
Habitat.
It lives among the stones of the walls of the terraces and in the crevices of limestone rocks oriented to the north and northwest. Depending on the degree of exposure to the sun, its phenotype changes a lot, becoming more coriaceous the more sunlight it receives. In the driest months of summer comes into estivation, dehydrating their fronds, reaching apparently dead. With the first rains of autumn, the fern rehydrate the dried fronds and turn green quickly.
Distribution.
Its population is distributed in three locations separated by the Mediterranean Sea: the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Ibiza and Formentera), south of the Iberian Peninsula (Albacete, Jaen, Malaga and Cadiz) and the north of Morocco (from Chefchaouen in Western Rif until the rocks surrounding the Caves of Chameau in Mountains of Beni Snassen).

The Honda CB200 (Honda Model # 354) is a road motorcycle (aka 'Sport') produced between 1973 and 1976. It replaced the CB175 model and has very similar specifications. It has a chain driven single overhead camshaft parallel twin engine with dual carburetors and five speed gearbox. It had both an electric starter and kick starter. A distinguishing feature is the rubber trim down the middle of the fuel tank. It has a related on/off road model the Honda CL200 that shares many parts but has an upswept exhaust system to avoid road hazards.
Depending on where in the world the bike was sold it is known as a CB200A/CB200B or CB200K/CB200T. All CB200s had a rear drum brake. Early models (CB200A - 73 and 74) had a drum front brake, later models (CB200B - 75 and 76) had a cable operated front disc brake. The cable operated front disc brake was controversial in its day, and had contradicting reviews as to its safety and braking ability. 
The CB200 was a solid, well built, simple and light street bike introduced when Honda was consolidating its reach in many major markets (USA, Australia, England etc.). 
The CB200 is legal for some categories of Bucket racing.

Scottish Six Days Trial

The Scottish Six Days (Open Reliability) Trial is an internationally recognised Motorcycle trials competition, which has been running since 1909 (with breaks for the two world wars) making it the oldest motorcycle trials event in the world. Motorcycle riders from all over the world compete in this extreme sport, covering as much as 100 miles a day on road and off-road routes around Lochaber on each of the six days. The event is a trial of the skill, consistency and endurance of the riders, as well as a test of the specialised motorcycles used. 
History.
The inaugural Scottish motorcycle trial was held in July 1909 and was a five day event. Originally, the trial started in Edinburgh, going to John O'Groats before returning to Edinburgh. It aimed to be the most challenging motorcycle trial ever held. The Edinburgh & District Club organised the event from 1911. Prior to that event the organisers were a combination of local clubs in the Edinburgh area. By 1912 the event was known as the "Scottish Six Days Open Reliability Trial" and by 1914 rules were agreed together with a marking system and time penalties for machine faults. The outbreak of the First World War halted competition but the Six Days Trial returned in 1919. Problems with following the route were solved by marking the course with yellow ochre from a barrel mounted on a car (a system which stayed in place until the mid-1970s, when the present system of marker arrows and orange flags for off road sections was introduced). The scoring system was updated in 1926 to allow for condition, hillclimbing and brake testing but the event was still a test of motorcycle reliability. From the 1930s factory teams became more prevalent and in 1932 the results system was further amended to identify an outright winner. In 1938, Fort William was chosen as the central point of the trial although, it still started and ended in Edinburgh. The outbreak of World War II stopped competition until 1947, when 108 competitors took part. In 1977, the event broke its link with Edinburgh and the event started and finished in Fort William. This was due to the Gathering of the Clans taking up a sizeable amount of accommodation in the Capital. The organisers were forced to move the start and finish to Fort William, but it proved very popular move, as it assisted the logistics of the trial for both competitors and officials. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Scottish Six Days Trial grew in popularity and was established as the most important event for trials motorcycles.
The club.
The Edinburgh & District Motor Club Ltd is based in Edinburgh and was formed through the amalgamation of several Edinburgh based motor clubs in 1911. The headquarters of the Edinburgh & District Motor Club Ltd and hence the SSDT was at 28 Nelson Street, Edinburgh until 2001 when the premises were sold for redevelopment. It is the recognised organisation responsible body for the Scottish Six Days Trial. The club decided to celebrate 100 years of the event in 2011, this resulted in a massive over-subscription of the trial. Since the 1940s the event has been known as "A Sporting Holiday in The Highlands" but in reality it is a truly competitive event.
The 1950's and 1960's.
Over the years particular makes of machine appear to have dominated the trial. One such make was the AJS. Manufactured by Associated Motor Cycles (AMC) in Plumstead, South East London, England, the rugged and reliable AJS Model 16 was considered ideal for the demands of the Scottish Trial, with modifications including upgrading the frame to a welded duplex tubular frame with an engine cradle to reduce weight and redesigned exhaust and footrests to improve ground clearance. In 1957 it was further redesigned to increase clearance from 7 inches to 10 inches. Hugh Viney led the AJS works team in the post war years and won the challenging 1947 Trial on an AJS 16MC at his first attempt - then repeated the achievement the following year and made it three in a row in 1949. In the 1950s this record was beaten by another AJS Works Team rider Gordon Jackson, who won the "Scottish" four times, in the 1961 event he won the trial losing only one mark. 
Present day.
The "Scottish" has been based at Fort William since the 1977 event and is so popular that there are usually over 500 entries for the 275 places available. Of the 275 places, 30 are reserved for factory teams and a further 50 for allocation by the Club. The remaining places are allocated through a ballot system. Following a period of private refuelling services and the increase in health and safety regulations, the British Army were invited and made use of the SSDT as a live refuelling exercise called 'Operation Highland Trot'. The future of the SSDT was put into temporary jeopardy in 2003 when the Army reluctantly announced in late 2002 that they were no longer able to provide a refuelling service. However, the SSDT was able to continue through 2003 with another branch of the Army taking over the refuelling services. Since the 1960s it has been customary for a Scotsman to be allocated the riding number 1. The trial celebrated its 'Official Centenary' in 2011, 100 years since the 1911 event, which was the first organised by the Edinburgh & District Motor Club Ltd. The majority of the event takes place on private ground, connected by public highway. Following the event by motorcycle on private land is strictly prohibited, as permission for the competitors and officials is only granted under this caveat. Spectators at observed sections are welcome, but those spectating are asked to park sensibly at or near sections. Observing these requirements will thus ensure the future of this prestigious event. The trial organisers work very closely with landowners and government agencies to ensure that the environment is protected during not only the event itself, but the preparations prior to it on an annual basis.

Fixed tax

A fixed tax is a lump sum tax that is not measured as a percentage of the tax base (income, wealth, or consumption). Fixed taxes like a poll tax or sin tax are often considered regressive, but could have progressive effects if applied to luxury goods and services.
Since citizens share common roads, military protection, policing, and other government services, some argue that citizens should pay the same amount for basic infrastructure. Fixed taxation removes the moral dilemma of two individuals having to pay significantly different amounts in order to receive the same services, which could be argued as discrimination against economic success.
It is argued that a fixed tax can save on tax compliance costs and improves privacy. Unlike proportional taxes, a fixed tax does not necessitate public insight, i.e. governments would not need to know individual income, wealth, or consumption.
However, when applied as a precondition of membership in society or on products bought by the poor, it functions as a potentially extreme regressive tax in that it doesn't consider a person's ability to pay unless further adjustments are made (e.g. the way that the Australian HECS system applies tertiary education charges from a fixed schedule, but defers payments according to people's ability to pay by piggybacking payments as a progressively based surcharge on income tax). This can result in the lower income taxpayers paying much higher proportions of their incomes on taxes, incomes that are less disposable in that they must also pay a larger percentage of their incomes on necessities. Because of this, fixed taxes are better suited to funding governments which are not responsible for providing very much for the citizens and therefore do not have much to pay for.

Cross International

Cross International is a Christian relief and development organization based in South Florida, United States, that provides food, shelter, water, education, medical care and emergency aid to the poor in over 36 developing countries across the globe. Cross was recently recognized for its work in Haiti, receiving a $4.8 million grant from the U.S. government for a new program seeking to care for children and families impacted by AIDS in the country. From its headquarters in Pompano Beach, Cross International raises millions of dollars through donations each year to fund development programs that target the “poorest of the poor” in developing countries, and it ships millions of dollars' worth of humanitarian goods to high-need areas such as Kenya and Nicaragua.
Cross is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.
History.
Founding.
Cross International is a 501(c)3 organizations that seeks to provide food, shelter, and hope to the poorest of the poor. Cross's mission is to reach out to those living in dire poverty and holistically raise them up by working with local churches in the area to also stimulate local economies. The organization began in January 2001 when Founder and President Jim Cavnar started it with the goal of creating a holistic organization that would serve the physical and spiritual needs of the poorest people in the developing world. 
Growth.
Just eight years after its founding, Cross International Alliance was named the 69th largest non-profit in the U.S. by the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Since its start, Cross has provided more than $1 billion in cash grants for development programs and humanitarian aid shipments to help the poor in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and the U.S. In 2005, the charity moved its main office from Boca Raton to its current headquarters in Pompano Beach. The Cross International employs about 100 people in the U.S.
Leadership.
The day-to-day operations of Cross are directed by President Jim Cavnar, who came to the charity with thirty-four years of experience in the start-up and management of non-profit organizations. Cavnar helped launch Cross International after having served as executive director for eight years at the international relief and development organization Food for the Poor in Deerfield Beach, Florida.
Relief and development work.
Mission and work.
Cross International’s priority is to help "the poorest of the poor." Its work began in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and has since grown to reach those suffering extreme poverty in other Caribbean countries, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The charity uses two methods to provide aid to the poor: 1) cash grants to support development projects run by in-country ministries, and 2) shipping humanitarian aid.
Cross provides millions of dollars' worth of relief and disaster aid each year, such as relief for earthquake, flood, hurricane and tsunami victims. It also supports hundreds of development projects, including, care and education for orphans and other vulnerable children, housing for the homeless, medicines and health care for indigent people, food for families suffering extreme malnutrition and clean water for communities that have none, as well as micro-enterprise programs and other long-term development efforts to break the cycle of poverty.
In every case, Cross’ method of outreach is the same: it locates needy church-based ministries serving the poor in developing countries and provides them with financial support and distributes material aid through their existing programs. This style of outreach enables Cross to supply meaningful help where it is needed most, while keeping overhead costs low.
Countries of operation.
Between its development projects and humanitarian aid shipping, Cross has served the poor in over 30 countries. They are:
Work in Haiti.
Cross International heavily supports relief and development in Haiti, the country where it began its work in 2001. It funds more than 25 development projects throughout the country — including orphanages, care for AIDS orphans, school feeding and scholarship programs, medical care, clean water programs and housing construction — and ships millions of dollars' worth of aid there each year.
During the violent 2008 hurricane season when Haiti was battered by several storms, leaving hundreds dead and much of the country under water, Cross was one of the first groups to respond to the crisis, providing cash grants to Christian ministries in the country so they could buy food for the people. Cross also provided emergency aid to the hardest-hit part of the country, Gonaives, through airlifts and ground shipments, supplying 70,000 pounds of food to Gonaives over several days.
Because of its history of aid to Haiti, Cross was awarded a $4.8 million grant from the U.S. government for a new program seeking to stem the spread of AIDS in Haiti. The grant, announced Dec. 1, 2008 for World AIDS Day, was awarded through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an initiative started by the Bush administration in 2003 to combat global HIV and AIDS. Cross was one of 19 nonprofit groups to receive funding after a rigorous winnowing process in which 800 different applicants were reviewed. The three-year project will reach an estimated 5,000 orphans and vulnerable children, providing them with the care and medical services, and about 92,000 youths and their families will receive AIDS awareness and destigmatization messages through Cross’ efforts. The program will target destitute people in Haiti’s Grand Anse region, the central plateau, the southern coast and Port-au-Prince.
Fundraising.
Cross International depends on donations of money and goods from benefactors in the United States, as well as government grants to fund its many aid projects. The majority of its work is made possible through private donations of money and goods.

Banking Company of West Africa (CBAO)

The Banking Company of West Africa (CBAO) (French: "Compagnie bancaire de l'Afrique occidentale") is a Dakar, Senegal based private bank.
History.
The CBAO traces its history back to the 1853 French Imperial Bank of Senegal, through the 1901-1962 Bank of West Africa (BAO), to the Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale and its restructuring from a Senegalese government investment bank to an internationally owned retail bank.
Renaming and Reorganization.
The CBAO is the result of a 1993 renaming and reorganisation of the International Bank for West Africa (BIAO), formed from the Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal, Niger, and several other branches of the pre-independence sections of the French colonial Bank of West Africa (BAO). Some sections in Central Africa became the Banque internationale pour la Centrafrique (BICA). The Senegalese section split from the other BIAO banks and was partially privatised in 1965, thereafter owned by the Senegalese Government and the United States Citibank company. In 1989, the BIAO Senegalese sections were liquidated into several private institutions, with a majority share of the largest going to the Senegalese MIMRAN Group. 1991 to 1997 marked a general collapse of the BIAO banks across West Africa: Méridien BIAO SA and Méridien international Bank limited (MIBL) of the Bahamas consolidated banks as Méridien BIAO Burkina, Méridien BIAO Niger (later BIA-Niger), Méridien BIAO Gabon, Méridien BIAO Cameroon, Méridien BIAO Chad, and Méridien BIAO Togo. The Ivorian section survived and retained the name BIAO Côte d'Ivoire, and was itself later privatised.
Recent Situation.
In 2007, the Moroccan Attijariwafa bank bought a majority stake of the CBAO, and in 2008 joined it with the majority Attijariwafa owned Attijari Bank Senegal. The CBAO operates as a private retail and commercial bank entirely within Senegal.
As of December 2007, the CBAO had a capitalisation of 11 billion, 450 millions CFA Francs. Attijariwafa bank owned 79.15%, 9% was retained by the government of Senegal, and 12% was held by other private investors.

Career.
Her first book, "Jo també sóc catalana" (I am also Catalan, 2004), was strictly autobiographical, dealing with the issue of identity, and the growth of her sense of belonging to her new country. In 2005, she participated in an event sponsored by the European Institute of the Mediterranean, along with other Catalan writers of foreign descent, including Matthew Tree, Salah Jamal, Laila Karrouch and Mohamed Chaib. During the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2007, where Catalan culture was the featured guest of honour, she traveled to variousGerman cities to participate in conferences in which she offered her perspective on contemporary Catalan literature. El Hachmi has made frequent appearances in the media, including Catalunya Radio, and the newspaper Vanguardia.
In 2008, she won one of the most prestigious award in Catalan letters, the Ramon Llull prize, for her novel "L'últim patriarca" (The Last Patriarch). The novel tells the story of a Moroccan who immigrates to Catalonia, a sometimes despotic patriarch who enters into conflict with his daughter, who breaks with the traditional values of the old country to adapt to the new, modern culture in which she finds herself.

Tompaulin were an indie pop band formed in Blackburn, Lancashire, England in 1999, and named after the Irish poet, critic, and lecturer Tom Paulin.
The band initially comprised Stacey McKenna (vocals), Simon "Tap" Trought (guitar), Jamie Holman (bass), and Ciaron Melia (drums), although the line-up changed several times with other members including Amos Memon, Katie Grocott, Giles Cooke, and Lee Davis. The band released five singles on the Action Records, Track & Field, and Ugly Man labels, before the release of their debut album, "The Town and the City" in 2001. The album was called "amazingly self-assured, confident and among the best releases of 2001" by "Flak" magazine. The band were often compared to Belle & Sebastian, and their music was described by Kitty Empire in the "NME" as "equal parts beguiling and entertaining", while The Times described them as "exactly the right balance between grim reality and the chord sequences that lift you out of it". A further single followed on Track & Field in 2002, and the band went on to release two further albums on the label before splitting up.
The band recorded two sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show, in 2000 and 2001.

Pamela Davis

Pamela Meyer Davis is the president and C.E.O. of Edward Hospital in Naperville, Illinois. Her complaints in 2003 began the probe that led to the 2008 arrest of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.
According to the Washington Post,
Pamela Meyer Davis had been trying to win approval from a state health planning board for an expansion of Edward Hospital, the facility she runs in a Chicago suburb, but she realized that the only way to prevail was to retain a politically connected construction company and a specific investment house. Instead of succumbing to those demands, she went to the FBI and U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald in late 2003 and agreed to secretly record conversations about the project.
Her tapes led investigators down a twisted path of corruption that over five years has ensnared a collection of behind-the-scenes figures in Illinois government, including Joseph Cari Jr., a former Democratic National Committee member, and disgraced businessman Antoin "Tony" Rezko.
The FBI initially laughed at her report of wrongdoing, but agreed to participate, finding widespread graft and corruption.

Marmaduke Sheild

Arthur Marmaduke Sheild (1858-1922) was a surgeon, whose career was curtailed by a self-inflicted accident while operating, and a benefactor of Cambridge University, which named its chair in pharmacology in his honour.
Education.
Marmaduke Sheild was born in 1858 in Landawke, near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. In 1875 he began a distinguished student career at St George's Hospital winning the Brackenbury Prize and two William Brown Exhibitions before graduating MRCS in 1879. After starting as a house surgeon at St George's, Sheild then spent three years from 1881 in Cambridge, simultaneously as a house-surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital and an undergraduate at Downing College; during this period he qualified as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1883.
Surgical career.
After leaving Cambridge Sheild held posts at St George's as anaesthetist and Westminster Hospital, culminating in a seven-year period at Charing Cross Hospital where he was assistant surgeon, aural surgeon, demonstrator of anatomy and lecturer in practical surgery. In 1893 he returned again to St George's, becoming full surgeon in 1900. While practising as a surgeon he also acted as an examiner for Cambridge University and the Society of Apothecaries.
During his career Sheild published many articles and books; his most notable work was a "Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the Breast" which was published in 1898.
Retirement and war service.
Sheild's career as a surgeon was cut short in 1907 at the age of 49 when he accidentally inoculated himself while operating, resulting in a long illness requiring many operations. He retired to Budleigh Salterton and during the First World War was sufficiently recovered to be able to provide surgical services at the nearby military hospital at Exmouth.
Death and legacy.
Sheild died on 5 August 1922 in the Hebrides after suffering a seizure. By his will he established the Marmaduke Sheild Fund at Cambridge University which initially funded the Sheild Readership in Pharmacology and medical scholarships which are awarded to the present day. In 1946 Cambridge University honoured Sheild by naming its newly established chair in pharmacology in his name.

Nazi Love Camp 27 (Italian: La svastica nel ventre) is a 1977 Italian Nazi exploitation film by western director Mario Caiano starring Sirpa Lane. The film is notable for its truly grim scenes, dramatic plot and hardcore sex scenes.
Plot.
The film opens with Hanna and her German soldier boyfriend making love in a field in the days before the outbreak of World War II. Once the war has broken out, the Jewish Hanna and her family are rounded up, but not before her mother is killed trying to defend the family. They are then taken to a concentration camp. 
At the camp, Hanna and a female companion are gang raped by SS soldiers, leading Hanna's friend to throw herself on a barbed wire fence out of despair. Soon after, Hanna is forced to work in the "love camp" section of the camp, servicing SS soldiers. The commandant takes a shine to Hanna, and she becomes his personal lover. She is then placed in charge of a brothel for Nazi officers. 
Meanwhile, her boyfriend works at a Lebensborn program, and tries to search out Hanna, thinking her dead. When they meet, Hanna refuses to be rescued and instead heads back to the brothel to kill the commandant in vengeance. Hanna then travels to a party of SS soldiers and sings a Jewish song. As they react violently, she shoots a general, before being gunned down herself.

As of April 2006 there were 410 Grade I listed buildings in Suffolk, England. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of "exceptional architectural or historic special interest"; Grade I structures are those considered to be "buildings of "exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important.

AN/PRC-6

The AN/PRC-6 is a walkie-talkie used by the U.S. military in the late Korean War era through the Vietnam War. Raytheon developed the RT-196/PRC-6 following World War II as a replacement for the SCR-536 "handy-talkie". The AN/PRC-6 operates using wide-band FM on a single crystal controlled frequency in the 47 to 55.4 MHz low band VHF band. Rated power output is about 250 mW. The range is about one mile, but much less in jungle.
The AN/PRC-6 circuit uses 13 vacuum tubes for the receiver and transmitter combined, all but one subminiature. The unit may be changed to a different frequency in the field by replacing the crystal and adjusting tuned circuits, using tuning indicator ID-292/PRC-6. The tuning chart inside the case is not accurate enough to properly align the unit. The AN/PRC-6 uses a 24 inch whip antenna, with a BNC connector for an external direction finding antenna. There is an optional handset H-33*/PT that can be connected to the AN/PRC-6 by a 5 foot cable. The RT-196 can be carried over the shoulder using a provided web sling.
The US Marine Corps made limited use of the AN/PRC-6 as late as 1972.
The AN/PRC 6 was also manufactured under licence in France ("TR-PP-8") and Germany (6 channel version or PRC6-6). Israel too manufactured single channel equipment. Modernisation of the AN/PRC6 resulted in various solid state crystal controlled and synthesised radios, usually with higher output ratings. For example, Greek valved sets were refurbished in the mid-1980s and converted into single channel solid state one watt units housed inside the original casing.
These updated solid state versions were given various designations such as PRC-6T (for "Transistor"), PRC - 6T/180 (180 channel synthesised unit) and PRC - 6GY.
The frequency range of the PRC-6 covers the 6 metre amateur radio band (50-54 MHz in the US and Canada, 50-52 MHz in the United Kingdom), and the many versions of these sets are relatively available and cheap (around £30-40 in the UK) in comparison to other vintage military radios. As a result many examples have been put on the air, although practical operation is hampered by the necessity of building your own power supplies (the original dry batteries, which supplied +1.5, +4.5, +45 and +90 volt outputs, being unobtainable or display pieces only) and the limited output power and range. In addition a separate crystal and laborious retuning is required every time a frequency change takes place. For this reason in the US 51 MHz is used as a net frequency at many radio events, necessitating only the one crystal.

Brock N. Meeks

Brock N. Meeks (born 1956) is an award-winning investigative journalist. He pioneered the field of online journalism and founded one of the preeminent online publications, CyberWire Dispatch, in 1994. At its peak, CyberWire Dispatch was distributed to more than 800,000 readers via mailing lists and newsgroups. At the height of his online career, Meeks was "the most widely read reporter in cyberspace." [http://www.jdlasica.com/1996/11/01/net-gain/] CyberWire Dispatch officially ceased publication in early 2004. 
Meeks's articles focused on the intersection of government and technology, and were among the first to explore issues such as online rights – including free speech and the right to privacy – encryption, censorship, and the regulation of content.
Meeks gained a degree of fame he'd probably rather not have by being the first journalist sued for libel in cyberspace while writing his CyberWire Dispatch. Journalist and author Dan Gilmor wrote in his book "We the Media": "[Meeks was, by most accounts, the first Internet journalist to be sued for libel. For all practical purposes, Meeks won the case; he paid nothing to the Ohio company that sued him over his critical report about the company’s business practices, though he did agree to notify the company before publishing anything else about it or the man who ran it. Meeks did pay his lawyers, including several noted First Amendment specialists who donated the vast majority of their time.

Guerino Gottardi

Guerino Gottardi (born December 18, 1970 in Berne) is a retired Swiss-Italian football player. After joining Lazio in 1995 from Neuchatel Xamax, Gottardi was often used as a "supersub" and was instrumental in Lazio's 1998 Coppa Italia victory. With Lazio losing 2-0 on aggregate, Gottardi came off the bench to win a penalty, and then score before Alessandro Nesta's winner gave Lazio a 3-2 aggregate victory over A.C. Milan. Gottardi can also be remembered for an outstanding performance against Roma when he scored in the final minute of their second leg Coppa Italia clash, giving Lazio their third consecutive win against their arch rivals in the 1998/99 season. These two magical moments have ensured that Guerino Gottardi name will never be forgotten with true Lazio fans.

Indian route (United States)

An Indian route is a type of minor numbered road in the United States found on some Indian reservations. The routes are signed by shields featuring a downward-pointing arrowhead with varying designs depending on the state and/or reservation. These routes are part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Road System, which also includes federal aid roads, interior or locally funded roads, highway trust fund roads, tribal public roads, county or township roads, parts of the state highway system, and other federal agency public roads. Maintenance of these routes varies by locality and could be the responsibility of the BIA, a given tribal nation, or both.
BIA route numbers are used on sign posts, atlas maps, plans, programs, reports, and other bureau records requiring similar identification. A spur to an existing route is always assigned its own route number.
Historical usage.
Historically, the term "Indian route" referred to one or more components of an extensive network of trails used by indigenous peoples for war, trade and migration, long before the advent of railroads and highways. These routes were often along relatively high ground or ridges where the soil dried quickly after rains and where there were few streams to be crossed, following important mountain passes to connect river drainages, while trails traveling across rather than along rivers usually followed the fall line. Oral tradition is usually the major source for route identification, but this is sometimes supplemented by field notes of land-grant surveys, old county maps and historic narratives from scientists, explorers, soldiers and law enforcement officials. Later explorers, traders, and colonists followed some of the major routes, such as the Iroquois trail, up the Mohawk River, the Great Warrior Path that connected the mouth of the Scioto to Cumberland Gap and Tennessee Country, the Chickasaw-Choctaw Trail, which became the noted Natchez Trace, and the Occaneechi Trail, from the site of Petersburg, Virginia, southwest into the Carolinas.
Sections.
Contemporary Indian routes are divided into sections, each of which represents a discrete and specifically defined portion of the route. Sections are usually numbered 10, 20, 30 and so on in one of the orders that the sections would be traversed during travel. A section break occurs when it is necessary to accurately report data associated with a change in the nature of the route. In particular, a section break is required whenever any of the following occur: 
The main span of a bridge together with all its approach spans is a single section.

Battery electric multiple unit

A battery electric multiple unit or battery electric railcar is an electrically driven multiple unit or railcar whose energy is derived from rechargeable batteries that drive its traction motors. 
The main advantage of these vehicles is their clean, quiet operation. They do not use fossil fuels like coal or diesel fuel, emit no exhaust gases and do not require the railway to have expensive infrastructure like electric ground rails or overhead catenary. On the down side is the weight of the batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between 300 and 600 kilometres. Battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars and need a network of charging stations along the routes they work.
History.
Experiments with battery electric railcars were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the "Edison-Beach" type, with nickel-iron batteries were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a battery-electric Edison railcar operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm nickel-zinc battery was used on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on the Harcourt Street Line in Ireland and British Railways used lead-acid batteries in a railcar in 1958. Between 1955 and 1995 DB railways successfully operated 232 DB Class ETA 150 railcars utilising lead-acid batteries.
Germany.
In 1887 the first German battery electric cars were placed in service by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Their development continued with the pre-Second World War classes ETA 177 to 180, the post-war DB Class ETA 176 and finally ended with DB Classes 150, 515 and 517. The latter were used until 1995 having been since modernised into the "Nokia ETA", painted light grey and green and deployed onto the so-called "Nokia Railway" (timetable number RB 46), nowadays the "Glückauf-Bahn" from Gelsenkirchen via Wanne-Eickel to Bochum.
Japan.
In Japan, JR East tested a "NE Train Smart Denchi-kun" battery electric railcar from 2009. This vehicle is capable of running under 1,500 V DC overhead wires or on battery power alone a distance of up to 50 km away from an overhead power supply. The batteries are charged via the pantograph either when running under an overhead electric supply or at a specially built recharging facility.
From March 2014, a two-car battery electric multiple unit, the EV-E301 series, is scheduled to enter revenue service on the 20 km long non-electrified Karasuyama Line. This too is capable of running as an EMU under 1,500 V DC overhead wires or on battery power alone on non-electrified lines.
United Kingdom.
Battery electric railcars used by British Rail included the British Rail BEMU and British Rail Class 419. The Class 419 could work either on batteries or a third rail.
United States.
The Edison-Beach battery rail car was developed by Thomas Edison and Ralph H. Beach. The latter headed the "Railway Storage Battery Car Company" and the "Electric Car & Locomotive Corp". Car No. 105 of the Alaska Railroad was an Edison-Beach car. A notable feature of the Edison-Beach cars was the Beach drive system. Each wheel was mounted on ball bearings on a dead axle and was driven by an individual traction motor through gearing.
Battery locomotives.
In addition to "battery electric railcars" there are also "battery electric locomotives" that are used on underground trains, for mining and industrial duties. Examples include the London Underground battery-electric locomotives.
Supercaps.
A number of tramway manufacturers are offering battery railcars that combine the traction battery with a supercapacitor that will be loaded at each stop. The main motivation for the usage of battery-powered tramways is to avoid overhead wires across the city. Using boost charging at each stop allows to lower the size of the required traction battery.
The CAF Urbos 3 tramways was ordered for the Seville metro with the "Acumulador de Carga Rápida" system which uses short overhead wires at each stop for charging. The Seville trams have been operating since Easter 2011.
The Siemens Avenio tramways was ordered for Doha, Qatar with the "Sitras HES" system with an overhead conductor rail at each stop using a contact shoe instead of a pantograph. The opening of the system is scheduled to be in the autumn of 2015. There is already one Combino tramway equipped with Sitras HES that is running in regular service from Almada to Seixal, Portugal, since November 2008.

He only played with Mallorca during his career, amassing La Liga totals of 168 games and three goals over the course of nine seasons and spending 14 years with the first team overall. He subsequently became a manager.
Club career.
A hard-nosed player, Soler was born in Palma, Majorca, Balearic Islands, and played his entire career for local club RCD Mallorca. He made his first-team debuts in the 1990–91 season, and went on to amass nearly 400 overall appearances for the main squad.
In 1996–97 Soler was instrumental in helping Mallorca return to La Liga, and also appeared regularly the following campaign as the team finished fifth. He was named on the substitutes bench for the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final.
In his final two years, however, Soler played almost no part in the side's lineups, and retired after 2003–04 at the age of 34. Subsequently he took up coaching and, in January 2007, was appointed at Portuguese first division club S.C. Beira-Mar after the Aveiro team signed a cooperation deal with Inverfutbol, a Spanish-based sporting company, not being able to help the side avoid relegation.
In February 2009 Soler returned to his native region, replacing former Spanish international Francisco at the helm of lowly CD Atlético Baleares and suffering another relegation.

Thomas Brennan Nolan

Thomas Brennan Nolan (May 21, 1901 - July, 1992) was an American geologist.
USGS career.
After Director William Embry Wrather retired because of illness and age in 1955, Assistant Director Thomas B. Nolan became the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) seventh director in January 1956. During his 11 years as Assistant Director, Nolan had many times and for extended periods served as Acting Director so no transition period was needed. Nolan believed that geologists, because of the unique requirements imposed on them by their science, should expand their fields of interest from individual problems and "participate actively and authoritatively in the matters affecting the whole country." Until September 1965, when he resumed his research in Great Basin geology, Nolan pushed, prodded, and led the Survey to a broadened and intensified commitment to basic research, to the advancement of geology in the public service, and to the prompt publication of Survey results. As Assistant Director, he had also served as the Interior Department representative on the Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and Development, on the Scientific Advisory Committee on Specialized Personnel to the Selective Service Committee, and on the Advisory Board on Education of the National Academy of Sciences, and had been president of the Society of Economic Geologists.
As Director, his professional responsibilities outside the Survey were still further extended to service as vice president and president of the Geological Society of America, as vice president of the International Union of Geological Sciences, and on committees advisory to university geology departments. In 1956, the Geological Survey began an evaluation of the effects of underground nuclear explosions at the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada Test Site; that program was expanded to study the geologic and hydrologic conditions affecting the peaceful uses of atomic energy and the disposal of radioactive wastes.
In December 1958, Director Nolan, speaking at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, remarked that the early work of the Geological Survey had been characterized by a transition from exploration of a geographical to an intellectual frontier, but demands by younger scientists for studies of the geography of outer space might soon inaugurate a new cycle in the history of the US Geological Survey.
In 1959, the Survey compiled a photogeologic map of the Earth's satellite, the Moon, and began studies of tektites and impact craters. On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed as a goal "landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth" before the end of the decade, and in 1963, the US Geological Survey, in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, began to train astronauts in geology and to investigate and evaluate methods and equipment for geological and geophysical exploration of the Moon.

Anna and the King of Siam (novel)

Anna and the King of Siam is a 1944 semi-fictionalized biographical novel by Margaret Landon.
In the early 1860s, Anna Leonowens, a widow with two young children, was invited to Siam (now Thailand) by King Mongkut (Rama IV), who wanted her to teach his children and wives the English language and introduce them to British customs. Her experiences during the five years she spent in the country served as the basis for two memoirs, "The English Governess at the Siamese Court" (1870) and "Romance of the Harem" (1872).
Landon took Leonowens' first-person narratives and enhanced them with details about the Siamese people and their culture culled from other sources. The book has been translated into dozens of languages and inspired a 1946 film of the same title, the 1951 stage musical "The King and I" and related 1956 film musical "The King and I" and the 1999 film "Anna and the King". At the time of its publication, "The New York Times" called it "an inviting escape into an unfamiliar, exotic past . . . calculated to transport us instantly." "Atlantic Monthly" described it as "enchanting" and added, "the author wears her scholarship with grace, and the amazing story she has to tell is recounted with humor and understanding".
A King of Siam Speaks.
"A King of Siam Speaks" is an as-it-were first-person narrative drawn from English translation of some of King Mongkut's public papers and private correspondence, produced in 1948 by Seni Pramoj, who had been ambassador to the United States at the outbreak of World War II and Thailand's first post-war prime minister — together with his brother, politician and scholar Kukrit Pramoj, with the King given as author, and themselves as co-authors. On June 14, 1949, Seni, with his brother in the audience, delivered a lecture in which he quotes, with humor and understanding, from the King's Acts and judicial decisions to disabuse the fiction. The brothers also sent a pre-publication manuscript to American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat. Moffat later drew on the manuscript for his biography entitled "Mongkut the King of Siam". He then donated the Pramoj manuscript to the Southeast Asian Collection, Asian Division, Library of Congress. Twenty years earlier, in 1941, Margaret Landon's husband, Dr. Kenneth Landon, had been employed by the Library's Division of Orientalia under Dr. Horace Poleman. In her note at the end of the book, Margaret Landon thanks him for making available material for reconstructing some of the historical background. Specifically, she cites her use of a prior Thai-language book in the Library containing King Mongkut's correspondence.

Thimpu principles

The Thimpu principles or Thimpu Declaration were a set of four demands put forward by the Sri Lankan Tamil delegation at the first peace talks undertaken with respect to the Sri Lankan civil war. In July–August 1985 the Indian government organised peace talks in Thimpu, Bhutan aimed at bringing an end to the Sri Lankan civil war between Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups and the government of Sri Lanka. The declaration made by the Tamil delegation at Thimpu, in response to a government proposal, has come to be known as the Thimpu Declaration or Thimpu principles.
Introduction.
The Sri Lankan government delegation consisted of Hector Jayawardene (President Junius Jayewardene's brother), three lawyers, and an attorney. The Tamil delegation consisted of representatives from the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) and Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).
The Sri Lankan government delegation proposed draft legislation for devolution of power but this was rejected by the Tamil delegation. On 13 July the Tamil delegation responded, issuing the Thimpu Declaration with four key demands (the cardinal principles). The four cardinal principles became known as the Thimpu principles.
Thimpu Declaration.
The declaration stated:
The Sri Lankan government rejected all but the last principle as they violated Sri Lanka's sovereignty.
The peace talks collapsed on 18 August due to the intransigence of both delegations.

James 'Jim' Webb (15 January 1863 – 8 February 1913) was an English-born international rugby union player who played club rugby for Newport and international rugby for Wales.
Rugby career.
Webb began playing first class rugby for Newport Rugby Club in 1884 and was first selected to play for Wales against the first Southern Hemisphere touring team, the New Zealand Natives. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Wales were victorious over the tourists at St. Helen's, but it was reported that on the day all Wales the back players were visibly nervous to face the tourists, except for Webb and 'Buller' Stadden. Webb had an excellent game, completing a conversion after a try from Swansea's William Towers. Webb attempted a penalty goal from the half way mark during the game, narrowly missing; and was faultless in his role as full-back, a role which he was unaccustomed. Four days later on 26 December, Webb faced the same touring team, this time as part of his club team, Newport. Facing a far larger crowd than was present at the Wales fixture, Newport lost 3 tries to nil against the far more phyisical Māori team.
Webb's second and last game for Wales was in their very next match, against Scotland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Wales lost the match and Webb was not reselected for any future Welsh internationals.

The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)

The Eleventh Hour is an American medical drama about psychiatry starring Wendell Corey, Jack Ging, and Ralph Bellamy, which aired sixty-two new episodes plus selected rebroadcasts on NBC from October 3, 1962, to September 9, 1964.
Series Premise.
The series, loosely comparable to the 1961 NBC hit "Dr. Kildare", starring Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey, reveals the human stories of people who come to the psychiatrist either through private practice, a hospital, or a court of law. In 1963, the series shared a two-part crossover episode with "Dr. Kildare"; both programs used the theme of wise teacher and young intern.
The term "eleventh hour" refers to a time of last resort in an aggrieved person's life, as he faces a potential nervous breakdown. Ging appeared in both seasons as Dr. Paul Graham, a clinical psychologist to Corey's first-season character of the psychiatrist Dr. Theodore Bassett, advisor to the Department of Corrections. The first season hence offered episodes about the mental health of criminals.
In the second season, which ended new episodes on April 22, 1964, Bellamy replaced Corey in the role of Dr. Richard Starke, a psychiatrist engaged in private practice. The executive producer was Norman Felton; Sam Rolfe was the producer.
Scheduling Notes.
"The Eleventh Hour" aired on Wednesdays following "Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall" and "Espionage". In its first season, "The Eleventh Hour" was placed opposite the alternating anthology series, "Armstrong Circle Theatre" and "The United States Steel Hour" on CBS and the last season of "Naked City" on ABC.
In the second season, "The Eleventh Hour" faced "The Danny Kaye Show" variety program on CBS and "Channing", a drama series about life on the campus of a small college, which aired on ABC.

Valentin Taifun

The Valentin Taifun is a two-seat self-launching sailplane designed and built by Valentin Flugzeugbau GmbH of Hasfurt, Germany.
Design and development.
The Taifun is an all glass-fibre low-wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail and side-by-side seating for two occupants. It has a manually operated retractable tricycle landing gear. The Taifun is powered originally by a 80hp (60 kW) Limbach L2000EB (Volkswagen) engine with later production aircraft being fitted with 90hp (67 kW) Limbach L2400EB engine. The wings fold back along the fuselage sides for transportation and storage. The prototype, registered "D-KONO", first flew on the 28 February 1981. The main production aircraft had a 17 metre wingspan and was designated the Taifun 17E. Two examples of aircraft with a 12 metre wingspan were built as the Taifun 12E which were classed as light-aircraft rather than a motor glider.

Ukrainian Constituent Assembly election, 1918

Elections to the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly () were never finished as a result of events in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the following.
Organization.
There were 301 seats contested to the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly in 13 electoral districts starting on . The elections were proclaimed on November 20 by the Third Universal of the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Universal proclaimed that the Constituent Assembly would convene on .
The Universal proclaimed that the Constituent Assembly's 301 deputies were to be elected by a direct universal, equal and secret vote on the basis of proportional representation of 1 deputy per 100,000 constituents. Male and female citizens aged 20 and over who have attained the right to vote were allowed to participate in the elections.
Preparation.
Right before elections the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party tried to sabotage the elections through another coup-d'etat that was scheduled to take place on December 24 to establish the Soviet power in Ukraine. However, that attempt was effectively extinguished, all Bolshevik military formations were disarmed, and sent by train to the Soviet Russia including the 2nd Guard Corps led by Yevgenia Bosch that was stopped near Zhmerynka en route to Kiev in support of the mutiny. On December 30 the government of Russia (Sovnarkom) issued an ultimatum to reinstate legal rights of Bolshevik military formations in Ukraine, which was ignored.
Results.
According to the election results, 171 of the 301 deputies were elected in regions where the Bolsheviks were not in power. Over 70 percent of the total votes cast were for Ukrainian political parties while only 10 percent went to the Bolsheviks. Following political turmoil, the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly never convened and the Central Council took on its responsibilities. The elections were paused due to invasion of Russia and the chaos that was spread as the result of it. The Central Rada announced that it will act as the legislative body until the Assembly will be convened.

Kelley Point Park

Kelley Point Park is a city park in north Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Bounded by the Columbia Slough on the south, the Willamette River on the west, and the Columbia River on the north, the park forms the tip of the peninsula at the confluence of the rivers. Marine Terminal 6 of the Port of Portland lies immediately east of the park along the Columbia, while Terminal 5 is along the Willamette slightly south of the Columbia Slough. The park is at and rises to an elevation of above sea level. Sauvie Island is west of the park across the Willamette River. Hayden Island is slightly upstream of the park on the Columbia River opposite Marine Terminal 6.
The city acquired the park site in 1984 from the Port of Portland, which had covered much of the peninsula with dredged material from the Columbia River to create places to build terminals. The site was formerly part of Pearcy Island, separated from the mainland by sloughs, one of which was called Pearcy Slough. Pearcy Island still appears on topographical maps at even though it is no longer an island. Pearcy Island and Pearcy Slough were named after Nathan Pearcy, who settled a donation land claim on the island in 1850. Development projects later altered the landforms in this vicinity.
Park amenities include a historical site, paved and unpaved paths, picnic tables, public art, restrooms, and a vista point. The park, operated by the Portland Parks & Recreation Department, is open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Kelley Point was once the site of a small lighthouse.
Wildlife includes Bewick's Wrens that frequent the park's black cottonwood forest. Caspian Terns, Osprey, Double-crested Cormorants, and gulls are common near the rivers. Sights from the vista point include ship traffic on both rivers. An informal Columbia Slough canoe launch lies near the park entrance along Kelley Point Park Road, west of Interstate 5 along North Marine Drive. The 40 Mile Loop hiking and biking trail runs by the entrance to the park.

Kenneth Waltzer

Kenneth Alan "Kenny" Waltzer (born December 23, 1942) is an American historian and educator, currently director of the Jewish Studies program at Michigan State University (MSU). His research on the Buchenwald concentration camp has focused on the rescue of children and youths inside the camp and has included some notable findings.
Life and career.
Waltzer was born in New York and graduated from Harpur College at the State University of New York at Binghamton. He then earned a PhD in history from Harvard University.
He has been affiliated with MSU since 1971, when he was appointed to the faculty and went there to help build their residential college in public affairs. During his career, he has served as dean and associate dean of MSU's James Madison College, and as director of MSU's general education program in the arts and humanities. He was awarded a State of Michigan Excellence in Teaching Award in 1990 and MSU's Outstanding Undergraduate Teacher Award in 1998. Waltzer helped build MSU's Jewish Studies and study abroad program in Israel during the 1990s. After a hiatus during the Second Intifada due to security concerns, Waltzer helped persuade MSU to reinstate the study abroad program in Israel in 2006. Waltzer's Buchenwald-related research at the International Tracing Service determined that Fyodor Michajlitschenko was the young man who rescued Israel Meir Lau from Buchenwald. Michajlitschenko was posthumously awarded Righteous Among the Nations designation by Yad Vashem in 2009.
Historical and genealogical work.
Waltzer was among the key figures who exposed fabrications in "Angel at the Fence", the cancelled Holocaust memoir by Herman Rosenblat. Waltzer's Buchenwald research led him to raise questions about Rosenblat's story of his imprisonment at Schlieben, a sub-camp of Buchenwald. Other witnesses interviewed by Waltzer said Rosenblat's story "couldn’t possibly be true" and was "a figment of his imagination." Waltzer determined that maps of the camp also debunked Rosenblat's claims. Waltzer and his colleagues also determined that Rosenblat's wife and her family were hidden as local townspeople posing as Polish Catholics at a farm near Breslau, some 211 miles away from Schlieben. She could not have been heaving apples daily over the Schlieben camp fence.
Waltzer recently was the historical consultant for "Kinderblock 66", a documentary about Buchenwald's kinderblock 66 and about the efforts of Czech Communist Antonin Kalina, part of the camp underground, to protect imprisoned children. Antonin Kalina was granted Righteous Among the Nations status by Yad Vashem posthumously in 2012 and the announcement was made as "Kinderblock 66" played at the Jerusalem Film Festival.</ref> ref name Rothschild, Brad.> The Man Who Saved 900 Jewish Boys inside a Death Camp, The Times of Israel, April 9, 2013; [http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-righteous-gentile-who-saved-900-jewish-boys-inside-a-death-camp-buchenwald-antonin-kalina/];

He made two appearances that year, deputising for Uwe Schneider (no relation) as the club won the Bundesliga title. He spent the next couple of years back in Stuttgart's reserve team, and it wasn't until August 1994 that he made his third Bundesliga appearance, when he replaced Marc Kienle in a 2–2 draw with 1. FC Köln at the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion. Over the next seven years he established himself as a regular member of Stuttgart's first-team, playing alongside experienced defenders such as Thomas Berthold, Zvonimir Soldo and Frank Verlaat, and such were his performances that he was almost called up to the German national team by then coach Berti Vogts. In 1997 Stuttgart won the DFB-Pokal, and Schneider played in the final, replacing Matthias Hagner for the last 20 minutes of the victory over FC Energie Cottbus. The following year he was in the starting line-up for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, but Stuttgart lost 1–0 to Chelsea.

William Downham (1511–1577) was bishop of Chester.
Under Mary of England, he was chaplain to her sister Princess Elizabeth. He became bishop of Chester in 1561, shortly after Elizabeth's accession.
As bishop, he was considered rather ineffectual against the Roman Catholics, preferring not to offend the gentry. The reformer Christopher Goodman attacked him in 1571, as supine, on a pretext of the continuing Whitsun plays.
He had further problems with the diocesan finances, being dependent on rents that could prove hard to collect. He also had very few university graduates among his candidates for ordination.

Franz Xaver Schmid; name sometimes given as Franz Xaver Schmid-Schwarzenberg (October 22, 1819 - November 28, 1883) was an Austrian-German educator and philosopher born in Schwarzenberg am Böhmerwald.
From 1840 to 1844 he studied Catholic theology in Salzburg, receiving his doctorate of philosophy several years later (1850) in Freiburg im Breisgau. Afterwards he taught classes in history and philosophy at the Lyceum in Rastatt. In 1856 he became a lecturer at the University of Erlangen, where he subsequently became an associate professor of philosophy and pedagogy. During the 1850s, Schmid left the Catholic faith and embraced Protestantism. He died in Munich on November 28, 1883.
In 1871 at Erlangen he introduced the "Verein für Volkserziehung", which was essentially a child care center aimed at providing education and supervision for young boys. Success of the project eventually led to similar institutions being set up in other Bavarian cities; Augsburg (1878), Munich (1881), Fürth (1883) and Bamberg (1884). Schmid was the author of numerous works on religious philosophy and education; some of his better known publications are as follows:

Dr. Marcus Conant, et al., v. McCaffrey et al. (later, Conant v. Walters) is a legal case decided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on September 7, 2000, which affirmed the right of physicians to recommend medical marijuana.
Though the case involved chronic patients with untreatable diseases, the decision does not name these conditions as a prerequisite, nor does it limit drugs which may or may not be illegal.
The plaintiffs created a class action suit on behalf of licensed California physicians treating patients suffering from any of several severe and chronic conditions who discuss, recommend, or approve the medical use of marijuana for medical reasons. The class also includes all such patients. The named plaintiffs include eleven physicians,
a physician group,
an AIDS patient organization,
and six patients with terminal illnesses, including one who died during the course of the suit.
The case arose from two events: the November 1996 passage of California Proposition 215 which authorized medical marijuana, and a December 30, 1996 response to the law by the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy which said 
The statement accompanied authorization for the U.S. Inspector General for Health and Human Services to exclude individuals from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as physicians who recommend marijuana to patients for medical purposes. Clarification two months later affirmed that mere discussion of any drugs with a patient was not grounds for sanction, but affirmed that physicians "may not intentionally provide their patients with oral or written statements in order to enable them to obtain controlled substances in violation of federal law."
The district court's decision acknowledged that the government has a legitimate concern that physicians might recommend marijuana in bad faith. However, physicians in good faith using honest medical judgment should not fear DEA sanctions. Furthermore,
The government appealed the District Court decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in 2002.
Again the doctors and patients won and the federal government lost, while Judge Alex Kozinski's concurrence also brought in
the First Amendment right of patients to hear accurate information from their doctors, and the state of California's
right to make its own laws without being subverted by federal commandeering. The ruling set a precedent protecting doctors, patients, and state medical marijuana programs in
the ten states of the Ninth Circuit. The government again appealed the case, but the Supreme Court declined
to take the appeal in a brief notice dated October 14, 2003.

Coalition to Save Harlem

The Coalition to Save Harlem (CSH) is a collection of individuals and organizations brought together for the purpose of reclaiming, preserving and protecting the community of the Village of Harlem. Members include residents, business owners, community based organizations, artists, activists and civic groups.
The Coalition to Save Harlem advocates for community improvement and development; however it believes strongly that development must be in the best interest of the long-time residents of the Harlem community and therefore encourages community participation and leadership in the development process.
The Coalition to Save Harlem advocates for housing rights and the rights of locally owned business and street vendors; members also address issues regarding gentrification, education, housing, employment and economics in Harlem and adjoining neighborhoods/communities.
The CSH was extensively involved in rallying the Harlem community against the 125th Street Rezoning Plan initialled by the New York City Department of City Planning from late 2007 to mid-2008. The CSH organized the "Hands Across Harlem" event that encouraged Harlem residents to demonstrate in a peaceful manner against the 125th Street Rezoning project.
The focal point of battles became the largest building in square feet in the Harlem Community. Legislation was proposed requiring the owner to give the building back to the community. After many hearings and support from local policitians including Charlie Rangel, the legislation became a way for Harlem residents to be sure their culture is being preserved. The Coalition also filed suit against the developer. Ultimately the developer settled for over $1 million and allowed the tenants to continue their residencies in addition to the large payment. The building still stands as of July 2011.

<doc id="20883703" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20883703" title="East Ham Baptist Church">
East Ham Baptist Church

East Ham Baptist Church is situated in Plashet Grove, East Ham, a mainly residential area of the London Borough of Newham, United Kingdom.
History.
In 1895 the London Baptist Association (LBA) promoted services in East Ham, then a fast growing dormitory suburb. A temporary iron building at the corner of Katherine Road and Victoria Avenue housed the first congregation. R. Sloven became the first minister from 1896 to 1908.
In 1901 the congregation moved to a new building in Plashet Grove, designed by Edgar Stones, with a 1000 seater sanctuary, surrounded by halls and rooms. By 1903, membership was 972, one of the strongest in the then East Ham Borough. In 1908, Charles Howe led a team of East Ham members to start Bonny Downs Baptist Church situated in the southern part of East Ham. He stayed there for 53 years.
Worship, preaching, programmes and activities continued under the leadership of F. Williams from 1909–1919 and then returning from 1925–1929 after the ministry of F. C. Buck (1919–1924). Church attendance weakened after World War I (1914–1918), World War II (1939–1945) and population movement.
The slow decline of the 1930s accelerated during the 1939–1945 war and continued inexorably through a succession of ministers and then lay pastors. Membership was 228 in 1941 and only 52 in 1951.
Modern congregation.
Humphrey Vellacott came in 1967. His first morning congregation was 6, and 14 people in the evening. He left 100 members, a morning congregation of 150–200, evening 70–80, and a prayer and bible study of 50–60 of 'converts or restored back sliders' and a reshaped building and a team of young ministers working in East London Baptist churches.
With the surrounding population changing fast through immigration, particularly from Africa and Asia, the congregation became multi-racial but continued to record a steady 100 membership from the 1980s into the 2000s.
Roy Scarsbrook, joined and followed Humphrey Vellacott in September 1983 staying until August 2000, emphasising evangelism and eventually becoming one of a group of supported overseas missionaries, as he went to Poland.
Tony Watts, a New Zealander, came initially for a six-month interim pastorate but stayed to 2008, and faced a transient situation within a multi-faith, multi-racial environment.
After a year without a minister, the current minister Jeremiah Dawood took up this post in May 2009. The mission statement of the church is: "East Ham Baptist Church is a multicultural, mission-focussed church. We seek to build up the body of Christ by encouraging and equipping the members to find and exercise their gifts, and through this to touch the community both at home and abroad with the love of Christ."

Robert M. Grant (economist)

Robert Morris Grant is a professor and US economic strategy academic who challenged Michael Porter's views on the basis for competitive advantage. He suggested that competitive advantage was more frequently to be discovered in access to distinctive or unique internal resources, rather than a choice between the different forms of generic strategies externally.
Grant is best known for his suggestion that insights into competitive positioning were more likely to come from understanding a company's resource base rather than from its generic strategies. He particularly focused on the extent to which organizations had non-imitable resources.
Grant's work has close links to Gary Hamel and Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad – in the form of 'core competencies'. In many ways Grant's 'resources' and Hamel and Prahalad's 'core competencies' overlap to a considerable extent. His concepts have also been taken further by Bowman.

Expansion of the Bay Area Rapid Transit

Throughout the history of the Bay Area Rapid Transit, better known as BART, there have been plans to extend service to other areas.
Proposals.
Warm Springs extension.
A extension of BART south to the Warm Springs District in South Fremont is currently under construction. The Warm Springs extension will bring BART south to the Santa Clara County line which is a prerequisite for the extension to San Jose.
This extension received a green light from the federal government when the Federal Transit Administration issued a Record of Decision on October 24, 2006. The action enabled BART to begin purchasing the necessary right-of-way for the project and receive state-administered federal funding to finance the project.
In January 2009, the "San Francisco Chronicle" reported that $91 million in funding had been diverted from a similar project to link the peninsula and East Bay with commuter rail in order to begin construction on the Warm Springs Extension.
On February 10, 2009, BART requested bids for the first segment of the Warm Springs Extension, a subway under Fremont Central Park and Lake Elizabeth. The joint venture of Shimmick Construction Co. and Skanska USA Civil West California District Inc. won with a bid of $136 million which was 45 percent below the agencies' estimate of $249 million. On August 24, 2009, BART issued a "Notice to Proceed" to the contractors with construction beginning in Fall 2009. The contract for the above ground elements of the extension went to bid in late 2009 and construction began in spring 2010.
BART plans to have the extension open in 2014.
Revenue service is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2015.
On June 28, 2011, BART directors and the City of Fremont reached an agreement to construct an infill station in the Irvington District. BART would build all the track and basic infrastructure for the station as a part of the Warm Spring Extension. The Irvington BART Station was originally scheduled to open in late 2015. But due to the funding issues, the City of Fremont has postponed construction of the Irvington station. , the city of Fremont was still seeking funding for the construction of the station, and when funding is approved the City of Fremont will commence construction of the station.
Silicon Valley BART extension.
Phase 1 of the Silicon Valley extension will continue the Warm Springs Extension to the Berryessa neighborhood station in San Jose, linking the BART system to the Santa Clara VTA light rail. $900 million in funding by the Federal Transit Administration was awarded in March 2012, and the project officially started construction in April 2012, with this Phase 1 of the extension open to the public by late 2016. 
Berryessa extension (Phase 1).
The planned Phase 1 route will continue south from the Warm Springs/South Fremont station in Fremont. There are plans for one "optional" station at Calaveras Blvd/SR 237 in downtown Milpitas; this station is not currently planned to be built but remains an option as a future infill station. The next station in Milpitas will be at Montague Expressway, co-located with the existing VTA Montague light rail station. The end of the extended line will be in San Jose, where there will be an elevated station at Berryessa Road at the current site of the San Jose Flea Market. BART rail tracks would end at US 101 between the interchanges at Santa Clara and Julian streets. 
San Jose subway extension (Phase 2).
The original plan was for the extension to continue into downtown San Jose via subway. However, in February 2009, projections of lower-than-expected sales-tax receipts from the funding measures forced the VTA to scale back the extension, ending it at the Berryessa station and delaying tunneling under downtown San Jose to a future phase of construction (making it essentially a "Phase 2" of the project). The originally-planned complete extension from Fremont to Santa Clara was projected to cost $6.1 billion, but the VTA estimates the extension to Berryessa (Phase 1 only) would cost just $2.1 billion.
The plans for the downtown subway start with a portal before crossing under US 101. The Alum Rock subway station would be on North 28th Street between Julian Street and Santa Clara Street. The Downtown San Jose station would be underneath Santa Clara Street spanning the block from 3rd Street to Market Street. (The Downtown San Jose station was combined in 2005 from earlier plans for separate subway stations at Civic Plaza/San Jose State University and Market Street.)
The Diridon/Arena station would be between SAP Center at San Jose and Diridon Station, which currently serves Amtrak, Caltrain, ACE and VTA Light Rail.
The BART subway would then turn north, following the Caltrain route, and exit to the surface at another portal after crossing under I-880.
The Santa Clara BART station would be co-located at the existing Santa Clara Caltrain station.
Separate construction plans by San Jose International Airport would bring a people-mover train to the Santa Clara BART/Caltrain/ACE/Amtrak station.
For the subway segment in San Jose, VTA plans to use a tunnel boring machine for most of the length in order to reduce disruptions to downtown during construction. Only the station locations would have cut and cover construction. This is different from how BART subways and stations were built in San Francisco and Oakland, which used the cut and cover method. The construction of the cut and cover stations in downtown San Jose would still cause major albeit temporary disruption, including closing several blocks of Santa Clara Street and severing the VTA light rail line at that street. The extension to downtown San Jose may open in 2025.
Funding and Electoral History (2000-2008).
Since Santa Clara County is not among the member counties of the BART District (having opted out of the district at its inception, like neighboring San Mateo county), VTA is responsible for building the extension within Santa Clara County. VTA allocated initial funds for constructing BART using the proceeds from a sales tax referendum which was passed by Santa Clara County voters in 2000. In December 2002, VTA purchased a freight railroad corridor from Union Pacific Railroad which will serve as much of the necessary right-of-way for both the Warm Springs and San Jose extensions for $80 million.
In 2004, the Federal Transit Administration decided to wait to fund the project, citing worries that BART did not have enough money to operate the extension. In addition, the San Jose extension project received a "not recommended" rating from the Federal Transit Administration placing the federal portion of the funding in jeopardy because of concerns about operation and maintenance funding. To address these concerns and help secure federal funding, Santa Clara County voters were presented with 2008 Measure B, a 1/8-cent sales tax raise, in the 2008 presidential primary election. Projections by an independent consultant recommended by the Federal Transit Administration predicted that the 1/8-cent sales tax would more than cover operation and maintenance of the planned extension. In initial vote counting from election day and well into the counting of absentee and provisional ballots, the measure was too close to call but was on the side of failing. On November 17, 2008, the measure flipped from failing to passing in the vote count update, with the required 66.67% of voters approving the tax increase, the very minimum for the tax measure to pass. On November 21, 2008, the result was announced that Measure B passed with 66.78% voter approval.
Oakland Airport Connector.
The Oakland Airport Connector (OAC) is an under-construction people mover line that will run from the existing Coliseum/Oakland Airport station to a future station close to Oakland International Airport's terminal buildings. It will initially have 2 stations, with a third intermediate station to be built as funding permits. When completed, it will replace the current AirBART shuttle bus service. The project is expected to cost approximately $484 million and is currently scheduled for completion in Fall 2014.
The Oakland Airport Connector will be operated by BART and will be integrated into BART's existing fare system. However, it will not utilize existing BART rolling stock and it will not be physically connected with existing BART tracks. The OAC will instead have its own fleet of automated guideway transit (AGT) vehicles that will operate on fixed guideways. The cable-drawn vehicles will be manufactured by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car and can form trains of up to 4 cars. The line is designed to have an approximate headway of 4.5 minutes and to complete a one-way trip in approximately 8 minutes, with an on-time performance of more than 99.5%. Initially there will be four 3-car trains (113 passengers each), but the system can accommodate an expansion to four 4-car trains (148 passengers each).
The OAC's connection to the existing BART system at Coliseum/Oakland Airport station will resemble the AirTrain JFK and AirTrain Newark airport people movers' existing off-airport connections to other rail transit lines. In this case however, both the airport people mover and connecting rail transit will be operated by BART and share the same fare system. The OAC's platforms at Coliseum/Oakland Airport station will be connected to the south ends of the existing BART platforms via an aerial walkway.
In late 2009 just prior to the award of the contract to construct the system, the project lost $70 million of federal stimulus funding because the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found that BART was out of conformance with Title VI. Among other non-OAC considerations, the FTA cited that BART did not complete the necessary analysis to determine if the future change in service will disproportionately impact low-income or minority communities. The FTA forced the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to reallocate the funding.
By September 2010, all necessary Federal and state funding for the OAC had been re-established, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 20.
eBART.
The eBART expansion plan calls for diesel multiple unit (DMU) train service to be implemented from the existing Pittsburg/Bay Point station. The first phase of the expansion will proceed east along the Highway 4 corridor to the city of Antioch with a Hillcrest Avenue station. The plan includes an option for a station at Railroad Avenue station in Pittsburg that would be built by that city. Future expansions in this direction could connect the eBART service to Oakley, Brentwood, Byron, and beyond to Tracy and Stockton. The DMU system was chosen as a less-expensive alternative to the existing third-rail BART design and because it would enable further extensions more easily. Funding for this expansion was approved in April 2009. On October 14, 2010, BART issued a press release announcing that the agency had awarded a $26 million contract to West Bay Builders, of Novato, California, "to build the transfer platform and make some of the necessary rail improvements to begin extending the line to a terminus station at Hillcrest Avenue in Antioch." Construction began in 2011, and revenue service is currently projected to begin in 2017.
Livermore extension: I-580/Tri-Valley Corridor.
This extension of either conventional BART or DMU BART service would go from Dublin/Pleasanton station east to Livermore. It could possibly continue over the Altamont Pass into Tracy and the Central Valley along I-580 and/or go north through Dublin, San Ramon, Danville, and Alamo to the existing Walnut Creek station via the I-680 corridor.
The extension of conventional BART rail to Tracy is considered unlikely, as San Joaquin County, in which Tracy is located, is not part of the three district counties and does not pay into the regional BART tax. The extension of third-rail BART, which would require exclusive and grade-separated rights-of-way over such a long distance, would be substantially more expensive. With conventional rail, existing trackage can be used, and incremental upgrades (such as grade separations at selected intersections, overhead electrification, signaling improvements, utilities relocation, etc.) are possible as funding dollars become available, but choosing BART would require a full build-out of the system initially, along with comprehensive funding.
An existing diesel commuter rail line, the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) currently operates through Livermore. A free shuttle transfers passengers between the ACE Pleasanton station and the BART Dublin/Pleasanton station, linking the two systems.
A preferred alignment was selected July 1, 2010 and originally had the support of the Livermore City Council. This alignment would have involved the construction of a station in downtown Livermore, and a second station on Vasco Road near Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. Both proposed stations would have provided nearby connections to Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) service.
However, in July 2011, the Livermore City Council reversed its position in response to a petition requesting that the alignment stay within or nearby the Interstate 580 right-of-way, and now favors stations be built at the Interstate 580 interchanges with Isabel Avenue and Greenville Road. BART's Environmental Impact Report Notice of Preparation, issued in September 2012, proposes a single station at I-580 and Isabel Avenue, with possible express bus routes connecting to the Vasco Road ACE station and a park-and-ride lot at I-580 and Greenville Road.
Infill stations.
The West Dublin/Pleasanton and Embarcadero stations are the only infill stations currently in the BART system.
BART planners have studied or planned infill stations for at least three other sites within the system. Infill stations are stations constructed on existing line segments between two existing stations. Construction costs for a planned 30th Street Mission station in San Francisco, between the existing 24th Street Mission and Glen Park stations, are estimated at approximately $500 million. A proposal for a Jack London Square station in Oakland was rejected as being incompatible with existing track geometry. A one-station stub line to Jack London Square at the foot of Broadway and the use of other transit modes also were studied.

Erie War

The Erie War was a 19th-century conflict between American financiers for control of the "Erie Railway Company", which owned and operated the Erie Railroad. Built with public funds raised by taxation and on land donated by public officials and private developers, by the middle of the 1850s the railroad was mismanaged and heavily in debt. A cattle drover turned Wall Street banker and broker Daniel Drew at first loaned $2 million to the railroad, and then acquired control over it. He amassed fortune by skilfully manipulating the Erie railroad shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Cornelius Vanderbilt, who set his mind on building a railroad empire, saw multiple business and financial opportunities in railways and decided in 1866 to "corner the market on Erie" by silently scooping the Erie railroad stock. After succeeding, Vanderbilt permitted Drew to stay on the board of directors in his former capacity as a treasurer.
Between 1866-1868, Daniel Drew conspired with James Fisk and Jay Gould, whom he brought on the board, to issue spurious Erie Railroad shares, thus "watering down" the stock, of which unsuspecting Cornelius Vanderbilt bought a large quantity. Vanderbilt lost more than $7 million in his attempt to gain control over Erie Railway Company, although Gould under threat of litigation later returned most of the money. As a result, Vanderbilt conceded control of the railroad to the trio. They were involved with the corrupt Tammany Hall political party machine, and made Boss Tweed a director of the Erie Railroad. Tweed (who later died in prison for embezzlement and fraud), in return arranged favorable state legislation in Albany for them, legalizing the newly issued shares. 
Gustavus Myers, an American historian and muckraker, wrote in his survey of railroad fortunes in the U.S., 
But in 1870, Fisk and Gould betrayed Drew, again manipulating the Erie Railroad stock price and causing him to lose $1.5 million. The Panic of 1873 cost him still more, and by 1876, Drew filed for bankruptcy, with debts exceeding a million dollars and no viable assets. He died in 1879, dependent on his son for support. 
Gould eventually gained the advantage in the conflict, but he had to relinquish control in 1872-73, following his loss of $1 million worth of Erie Railroad stock to the British confidence man Lord Gordon-Gordon. Public opinion was also hostile to Gould because of his involvement in the 1869 Black Friday stock market crash. In 1878, after all financial swindles and due to continuing mismanagement the Erie Railway Company declared bankruptcy and was reconstituted as the "New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway Company".

Kangirsuk (in Inuktitut: ᑲᖏᕐᓱᖅ/"Kangirsuq", meaning "the bay") is an Inuit village in northern Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. It is north of Kuujjuaq, between Aupaluk and Quaqtaq. The community is only accessible by air (Kangirsuk Airport) and, in late summer, by boat. The village used to be known also as "Payne Bay" and "Bellin".
Geography.
Kangirsuk is located above the tree line near the mouth of the Arnaud River on the north shore of Payne Bay, inland from the western coast of Ungava Bay. A rocky cliff to the north and a large, rocky hill to the west partially surround the village.
History.
In the 11th century the area was possibly visited by Vikings. Not far from the village on Pamiok Island, Thomas E. Lee, an archaeologist from Laval University, has discovered a stone foundation of what is believed to be a Viking long house. Another archeological site, Hammer of Thor, is located on north shores of Payne River about 25 km west from the village.
Inuit have hunted and fished along the Ungava Bay coast for centuries. Permanent European settlement did not occur until 1921 when the Revillon Frères company set up a trading post here, named Payne River in memory of Frank F. Payne, who explored the region during the winter of 1885-1886. Four years later, the competing Hudson's Bay Company also set up a post. The Inuit remained nomadic however and only visited the site as a summer encampment because of the abundance of game.
In 1945, the location was known as Payne Bay. In 1959, the federal day school was founded. From then on permanent settlement by Inuit finally began. In 1961, the federal government provided healthcare facilities, housing, and social services. That same year, the Quebec Government decided to give French names to places of the northern Quebec coast and changed the name of the post to Francis-Babel, in honor of Louis-François Babel (1826-1912). But this name did not take root, and was replaced a year later with Bellin, named after Jacques-Nicolas Bellin (1703-1772). It was subsequently known as Bellin (Payne) until 1980. That year, the name was changed to Kangiqsuk when the village was incorporated as a Northern Village Municipality (). Local authorities disagreed with this transliteration, and in 1982 it was corrected to Kangirsuk.
Demographics.
Population trend:
Flora and fauna.
Payne Bay and the Arnaud River are renowned for its excellent mussel harvesting. Numerous nearby lakes and rivers provide an abundance of arctic char and lake trout.
On the islands of Kyak Bay and Virgin Lake located to the east and north-east of Kangirsuk, respectively, important colonies of eider ducks nest every year.

Our Lady of Bethlehem

Our Lady of Bethlehem (Spanish: la Virgen de Belén) is a Flemish-style oil painting from Puerto Rico. Specialists in 15th-century art attribute the painting to the school of the Brussels painter Rogier van der Weyden, or an anonymous disciple of the school.
Details.
The image is painted on a wooden canvas. The woman in the painting, the Virgin Mary, is medium sized and has a tan and venerable face, lose hair, rays around the head, and content eyes gazing upon the child in swaddling clothes. She has one of her breasts uncovered, with small drops of milk falling towards the child's lips. The child reclines in his mother's arms, reciprocating the gaze of the mother. The Virgin Mary is wearing a blue blouse (not black) and a dark red or crimson mantle. Behind her, there is a dark grove of trees that looks like a mountain; this landscape represents her escape to Egypt. The painting arrived at a Dominican convent between 1511 and 1522. It measures 37.2 cm by 65 cm.
According to tradition, during the English invasions of 1598 and Dutch invasions of 1625, the painting was hidden and later found. In 1714 it was hung in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Cathedral of San Juan Bautista).
During the siege of Abercromby (1797), the bishop gave orders to Zengotita that daily public prayer would be held in parishes of the city. The participants, mainly women, sang songs and litanies and carried candles or torches in their hands. The painting of Our Lady of Bethlehem was carried through the city to ask God for help. Legend has it that the invading army saw men with torches. Frightened by such an imposing sight, they decided to withdraw and not attack the city. Thus, the protection of the city was attributed to Our Lady of Bethlehem, whom the town considered the "protectora de la ciudad," or "Guardian of the City." Today in the Caleta de San Juan, next to the ancient wall and facing the bay of San Juan, there is an imposing sculpture called "La Rogativa" or "The Public Petition," which commemorates this chapter in the history of Puerto Rico.
Out of his personal devotion and devotion to the people of San Juan, the Puerto Rican painter José Campeche reproduced the painting many times. Some of the reproductions of the original Our Lady of Bethlehem are in Galería Nacional del Viejo San Juan and the Museo de la Universidad de Puerto Rico in Río Piedras. Juan Alejo de Arizmendi was the first Puerto Rican bishop to call for devotion to the painting. In 1806 he granted forty days of indulgence to those who say a Hail Mary in front of image, praying to God for the purposes of the Church. The original Our Lady of Bethlehem later went to the San José Church of Old San Juan (the old St. Thomas Church of the Dominicans). It remained there until it disappeared in 1972.
Origin of the tradition.
According to the tradition, Mary and her child rested in a cave, called the Milk Grotto (la Gruta de la Leche), near the place where today stands the Church of the Nativity (la Iglesia de la Natividad). There, the Virgin Mary breastfed the child. A drop of milk fell on a stone of the cave, and the stone turned white. During the early centuries, this white rock, diluted in water, took the appearance of milk and was used as a religious relic.
The tradition of milk also dates back to the first centuries of Christianity. Those converting to Christianity were given a mixture of milk and honey to drink, which in the early churches of Egypt, Rome, and North Africa was solemnly blessed at the Easter and Pentecostal vigils. Milk with honey symbolized the union of the two natures in Christ. The custom of giving milk with honey to the newly baptized did not last long, but this tradition is visible in artistic representations.
Notable representations.
In the catacombs of Priscilla, Rome, a pictorial representation of the Virgin Mary made in the 2nd century stands out. It is likely that this is a virgin who can breastfeed. In the catacombs there are other symbols referring to milk.
In the church of the Chilandari Monastery in Mount Athos, Greece, a "Virgin of Milk" was immortalized in a painting, in the Byzantine style of the 11th and 12th centuries, called the "Panagia Galaktotrophusa."
In one of the images of the Virgin Mary (which is similar to the "Virgin of Milk" painting), in the town of Saydnaya near Damascus, there was an inscription in Latin from the 13th century: "Hoc oleum ex ubere Genitris Dei Virginia Mariae emanavit in loco, qui Sardinia vocatur, ubi genitilitas est, ex imagine lignea", which means "This oil flowed from the breast of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, sculpted from wood, which happened in the place of the Gentiles called Sardinia. This image was moved from Constantinople to Saydnaya, probably in the 11th century. Even after the 14th century, they distributed oil or milk. This representation had much influence. Templars distributed the oil or milk among the pilgrims and in many countries. It is very likely that this famous shrine of Saydnaya, which was a pilgrimage place for Christians of the East and West, is the source (or one of the major sources) of the artistic theme.
Representations of the Virgin Mary in the Netherlands.
Responding to the devotion and worship of the Virgin in Europe during the Middle Ages, the early Flemish painters produced numerous images of Mary. At the end of the 15th and 16th centuries, and up until the Council of Trent (1545–1563), the representations of the "Virgin of Milk" were popular in the Netherlands.
Rogier van der Weyden, the presumed creator of Our Lady of Bethlehem, was a Flemish painter of fame and prestige in the 15th century. In 1435 he left his home town of Tournai to settle in Brussels, where he was named the premier painter of the city. None of the paintings attributed to him are signed.
The interest in his art was not limited to the region of Brussels. He received orders from distant regions such as Italy, Savoy, cities along the Rhine, and Spain.
It is possible that van der Weyden's painting Our Lady of Bethlehem was taken to one of the convents of the Dominicans in Spain, and then later he took it with him on his trip to the Dominican friars who founded the first convent in Old San Juan.

General Instrument CP1600

The CP1600 was a 16-bit microprocessor created in a partnership between General Instrument and Honeywell in the 1970s. The CP1600's design was based on the PDP-11, whose design also formed the basis of the Western Digital MCP-1600 and influenced others. Honeywell used the CP1600 in a number of process control computers and related systems, but its most widespread use was the CP1610 version in the Intellivision video game console.
Description.
The CP1600's instruction set closely followed the PDP-11's, but was not entirely compatible. The instruction opcode was only 10 bits, with the remaining 6 marked "Reserved for future expansion". It appears that the extra 6 bits were intended to be used with co-processors, asserting the "PCIT" line which stalled the CPU until released. Instructions might be one to three words long depending on the addressing format being used. Unlike similar CPUs, the CP1600 did not support memory-memory indirect addressing (offsets), and looping was implemented in a different way which allowed it to run much faster.
Like the PDP-11, the CP1600 used eight 16-bit "general purpose" processor registers, although they were not truly general purpose as in modern designs. Only R0 was truly general purpose and has been described as "the primary accumulator". R1 through R3 were data counters, generally used for register-based addressing ("implied addressing"). R4 and R5 auto-incremented after being accessed, which made them useful for looping over collections of data.
R6 was the stack pointer, R7 the program counter. Since both of these registers were visible to the programmer, they could be used to implement multiple stacks, or support more complex branching, among other things. There were no implicit stack instructions; when R6 was used in a "read" operation it decremented the address and then returned the data being pointed at, simulating a codice_1, and when it was used in a "write" it would post-increment (like R4/R5) and write, like a codice_2.
Like the PDP-11, one of the CP1600's notable features was the use of memory-mapped I/O, meaning that devices were controlled by writing to certain locations in memory. Unlike the PDP-11's Unibus, however, the CP1600 multiplexed its data and address lines in order to reduce pin count and fit into a 40-pin DIP. This change meant that implementations had to use latches or buffers to be able to interface with the CPU as it changed the bus from indicating an address to data. This negatively affected I/O performance, and to address this problem GI designed the "Programmable Interface Controller" which was designed to work in concert with the CP1600 as a channel controller.
The CP1600 was implemented in nMOS and required +12, +5, -3 V power supplies; most internal logic was implemented in TTL (5 V). It had a 3.3 MHz clock (300 ns cycle time) that was later bumped to 5 MHz clock (200 ns cycle time), instructions executed within 1.6 and 4.8 microseconds. GI also produced a development system for the CP1600, the "GIMINI".
Uses.
The CP1610, used in the Intellivision, was essentially a "de-tuned" CP1600 with several simplifications. In the Intellivision, the CP1610 ran at 894 kHz to match NTSC signals, or 1 MHz for PAL/SECAM versions. Although users of the CP1600 in the traditional computer role were relatively rare, over 3 million Intellivisions were produced from 1980 until the video game crash of 1983 led to the closing of the Intellivision production lines in 1984.
Production of the CP1600 ended in 1985 when General Instruments spun off its microelectronics division to create Microchip Technology. By this point a number of 32-bit designs like the MC68000 were available that limited interest in a 16-bit design like the CP1600, and their main existing customer, the Intellivision, was no longer in production. Many other products were also end-of-lifed at the same time, and their primary product was the PIC.

Woody, California

Woody (formerly, Weringdale) is an unincorporated community in Kern County, California. It is located north-northeast of Bakersfield, at an elevation of 1654 feet (504 m).
Woody was founded in 1889, and was named after Dr. Sparrell Walter Woody, who was a pioneer in the area. The first post office at Woody also opened in 1889. In 1891, Joseph Weringer laid out the town, then called Weringdale, but the name quickly reverted to Woody.
Woody is mostly a ranch town, even though the ranches of Woody, lie usually a few miles out of town. At the "outskirts" of town is the Blue Mountain Graveyard. Across from the graveyard is the fire department. About one hundred yards west of the fire department, is a post office. In the town there is also an elementary school and a community hall, where the Woody residents have gatherings and events. There used to be a restaurant/ bar in Woody, but financial problems caused it to close.
Woody has been influenced by the nearby Blue Mountain. Blue Mountain at one time had a gold mine. Then bad times hit the mine and the owners sold out to the government, who dynamited the inside of the mine and sealed off the entrance. It has been rumored that the outlaw Joaquin Murrieta once had a cave/ hideout, that he used while on the run, however nobody has been able to find it, so it is just an "rural" legend.

Matthew Anthony Stevens (born July 30, 1964 in Sulphur, Louisiana) is a former professional American football quarterback who played one season in the National Football League. He played for the Kansas City Chiefs following the 1987 NFL strike. He played in three games for the Chiefs, starting two of them. He played high school football at Fountain Valley High School and collegiate football at UCLA.
In the 1986 UCLA vs. USC game, Karl Dorrell was on the receiving end of a play from Stevens that the "Los Angeles Times" dubbed "Hail Mary, and in your face.." On the last play of the first half, UCLA quarterback Stevens threw a Hail Mary pass, which was tipped into the hands of the flanker—Dorrell—to put the Bruins up 31–0 at the half. The Bruins went on to win 45–20.
Stevens was the quarterback for UCLA in the 1986 Rose Bowl in which the Bruins defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 45-28. Stevens was 16-26 for 169 yards and 1 TD. 
Stevens is currently the football color analyst on UCLA's flagship radio station. In 2001, Stevens was voted "Color Analyst of the Year" by the Southern California Broadcasters Association.

Italian aircraft carrier Sparviero

Sparviero (Italian: "Sparrowhawk") was an Italian aircraft carrier designed and built during World War II. She was originally the ocean liner MS "Augustus". The conversion was started in 1942 and was almost completed, but the ship was never delivered to the Regia Marina. She began to be scrapped in 1946, a process completed by 1952.
As the "Sparviero".
In 1936, a project to transform the 30,418 GRT ocean liner "Augustus" into an auxiliary carrier was prepared. The idea was initially abandoned but then resumed in 1942. The passenger ship "Augustus" was first renamed "Falco" and then to "Sparviero".
The superstructure was to be removed. She would had also been equipped with a single hangar with two lifts and fitted with a flight deck that ended 45 meters before the bow. She would have had a narrow flight deck. Her air group was to be either 34 fighters or 16 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers. The propulsion plant was to remain unchanged, the diesels giving an estimated speed of under 20 knots.
The conversion began in September 1942, the work undertaken by the Ansaldo Shipyard in Genoa. Apart from removing the superstructure little else was done before the Italian capitulation. The hull was captured by the Germans and was sunk on 5 October 1944 to block access to the port of Genoa. The wreckage was recovered after the war and finally scrapped in 1951.
Like the "Sparviero", the Italian aircraft carrier "Aquila", a modification of the sister ship of the "Augustus", , was scuttled and scrapped before the conversion into the aircraft carrier was finished. These two ships were the last attempts to build aircraft carriers for the Italian Navy until 1981, when work began on the "Giuseppe Garibaldi".

Tucker bag

A tucker bag is a traditional food or dinner storage bag used in the Australian outback. Typically a tucker bag was carried by a swagman or bushman. In its basic design a tucker bag is a pouch or bag with a single entry typically closed with a drawstring. Tucker bags can come in a variety of sizes and in its larger form can be used for carrying other utensils and sleeping gear other than food. In this way the tucker bag can be regarded as an early form of backpack. Common materials used to make tucker bags were leather or oilskin.
The term tucker bag appears in a number of traditional Australian songs and poems, including the lyrics in "Waltzing Matilda" "Whose is that jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?", reflecting the tucker bag's place in Australian culture and history.
In more modern times, tucker bags have become associated with reusable grocery bags used when shopping or traveling. Modern bags are typically made from polyester and come in a variety of styles and designs.

Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc.

Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234 (1964). is a 1964 United States Supreme Court decision that was a companion case to Sears v. Stiffel, which the Court decided on the same day. Like "Sears", "Compco" held that state law that, in effect, duplicated the protections of the US patent laws was preempted by federal law.
Background.
Day-Brite obtained a design patent on a lighting fixture, a cross-ribbed reflector for fluorescent light tubes. Compco’s predecessor copied the fixture and sold it in competition against Day-Brite. Day-Brite then sued for infringement of the design patent and unfair competition under Illinois state law, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
The district court held the design patent invalid but ruled in Day-Brite’s favor on the unfair competition claim. The court found that the overall appearance of Compco's fixture was "the same, to the eye of the ordinary observer, as the overall appearance" of Day-Brite's fixture, which embodied the design of the invalidated design patent; that the appearance of Day-Brite's design had "the capacity to identify in the trade, and does in fact so identify [it to the trade"; that the concurrent sale of the two products was "likely to cause confusion in the trade"; and that "ctual confusion has occurred." Accordingly, the court ordered Compco to pay damages and enjoined its further sale of the fixture.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment. It found that "several choices of ribbing were apparently available to meet the functional needs of the product," yet Compco "chose precisely the same design used by the plaintiff and followed it so closely as to make confusion likely." The only evidence of confusion was testimony by a Day_Brite employee that a third party plant manager had installed some of Compco's fixtures and later mistakenly asked Day-Brite to service the fixtures, thinking they had been made by Day-Brite. There was evidence that Compco clearly labeled its fixtures and their containers with Compco’s name. The Supreme Court characterized this evidence as showing that Compco sold an article that was an exact copy of another unpatented article, and that the conduct was “likely to produce, and did in this case produce, confusion as to the source of the article.”
Ruling.
In a unanimous ruling (although Justice Harlan separately concurred), the Court reversed. The Court reiterated its holding in the "Stiffel" case that:
hen an article is unprotected by a patent or a copyright, state law may not forbid others to copy that article. To forbid copying would interfere with the federal policy, found in Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution and in the implementing federal statutes, of allowing free access to copy whatever the federal patent and copyright laws leave in the public domain.
The Court held that the “findings” of the court of appeals about confusion, identification of the design with Day-Brite, lack of functionality of the design, and the like were immaterial because the absence of deception on Compco’s part:
It is true that the trial court found that the configuration of Day-Brite's fixture identified Day-Brite to the trade because the arrangement of the ribbing had, like a trademark, acquired a "secondary meaning" by which that particular design was associated with Day-Brite. But if the design is not entitled to a design patent or other federal statutory protection, then it can be copied at will.
As we have said in "Sears", while the federal patent laws prevent a State from prohibiting the copying and selling of unpatented articles, they do not stand in the way of state law, statutory or decisional, which requires those who make and sell copies to take precautions to identify their products as their own. A State, of course, has power to impose liability upon those who, knowing that the public is relying upon an original manufacturer's reputation for quality and integrity, deceive the public by palming off their copies as the original. That an article copied from an unpatented article could be made in some other way, that the design is "nonfunctional" and not essential to the use of either article, that the configuration of the article copied may have a "secondary meaning" which identifies the maker to the trade, or that there may be "confusion" among purchasers as to which article is which or as to who is the maker, may be relevant evidence in applying a State's law requiring such precautions as labeling; however, and regardless of the copier's motives, neither these facts nor any others can furnish a basis for imposing liability for or prohibiting the actual acts of copying and selling. And, of course, a State cannot hold a copier accountable in damages for failure to label or otherwise to identify his goods unless his failure is in violation of valid state statutory or decisional law requiring the copier to label or take other precautions to prevent confusion of customers as to the source of the goods.
Subsequent developments.
Day-Brite is still in the fluorescent lighting fixture business, as a division of Philips.

South Wales Premiership

The South Wales Premiership is the league for amateur clubs in southern Wales. Previously it was part of the Rugby League Conference but became standalone in 2012.
History.
The Rugby League Conference was founded in 1997 as the "Southern Conference", a 10-team pilot league for teams in the South of England and English Midlands. It expanded into Wales for the first time in 2001 when Cardiff Demons joined the South West division.
After two years of just one club in South Wales, the RFL saw that it was time to expand, letting in six more open-aged sides to form the new Welsh Conference and Wales gained its own division for the first time.
The Premier Division were set up in 2005 for teams who had achieved a certain playing standard and where able to travel further afield to find stronger opposition. The new Premier Divisions included the North Premier, the South Premier, the Central Premier and the Welsh Premier.
The Welsh Premier division was split into two divisions East Wales and West Wales in 2006, though this decision was reversed for the following season.
The Welsh Conference Junior League began in 2009.
Due to the growth of the sport in Wales, in 2010 a separate Championship division was formed which would function at one tier lower than the present Premier division. This Championship division featured teams from South Wales, but another Championship division featuring teams from North Wales was meant to be contested, but it didn't materialise and a rugby league nines tournament was played instead.
The South Wales Rugby League Championship was given a re-structure following four West Wales clubs not fulfilling fixtures. Amman Valley Rhinos, Dinefwr Sharks, Swansea/Llanelli Dragons and West Wales Wild Boars were omitted and replaced with newly formed Dyffryn Devils.
In 2012 the league became a standalone South Wales Premiership and the lower Championship division was abolished.
2013.
Premier Division: Bonymaen Broncos, Borderer Boars, Cardiff Demons, Newport Titans, Torfaen Tigers, Valley Cougars. Bridgend Blue Bulls and Blackwood Bulldogs entered but failed to start the season.
South Wales Merit Table: Cardiff Demons B, Cardiff Spartans, Gwendraeth Valley Raiders, Torfaen Tigers B
2012.
Teams.
Teams play each other on a home-and-away basis. Each Premier division then has its own play-off series to determine the champion with the five divisional winners entering the national play-offs.
The winner of the national play-offs is awarded the Harry Jepson Trophy.
Winners.
Competed for by the RLC Wales division since 2003
Welsh Shield.
Secondary Welsh competition for teams who do not make the play-offs for the Welsh Premier. It has not been contested since 2005.
Junior league.
Welsh teams also compete at under-17; under-15 and under-13 age groups.

2007 V8 Supercar Championship Series

The 2007 V8 Supercar season featured the ninth V8 Supercar Championship Series which began on 1 March and finished on 2 December. This championship consisted of 14 rounds covering all states and the Northern Territory of Australia as well as rounds in New Zealand and Bahrain. The series also carried the Australian Touring Car Championship title, which was awarded by CAMS for the forty eighth time in 2007.
The 2007 season was significant in that two new models of cars were being used by the teams. The Holden VE Commodore was a completely new car and the Ford BF Falcon consisted of several changes from the previous model. These cars debuted at the first round of the season at the Clipsal 500.
This season was also significant in that Channel Seven broadcast the series for the first time since 1996, after Channel Ten had rights to the series for the past ten years.
Pre-season.
The 2007 pre-season began with a number of driver and team changes which occurred during December 2006 and January 2007. The most important of the driver changes being Greg Murphy moving to Tasman Motorsport from Paul Weel Racing and Steven Richards changing not only teams, but also manufacturers by moving from the Holden based Perkins Engineering to the Ford Performance Racing team.
A number of team changes also occurred during the off-season with Vodafone being the naming sponsor for Triple Eight Race Engineering and Jim Beam joining forces with the Dick Johnson Racing team.
Most of the team launches occurred during late January and early February with a few exceptions, including the launch of Mark Winterbottom's FPR car in early January. As well as the individual team launches, an official season launch was held in Sydney's Martin Place on the 15th February.
A number of testing days were also held during the pre-season. These tests were conducted at the two race circuits used as test tracks, Queensland Raceway (TeamVodafone, DJR and WPS Racing) and Winton Raceway (most Victorian based teams including HRT, Ford Performance Racing, HSV Dealer Team and Perkins Engineering). Both of these major tests were conducted on the 19 February 2007.
One of the other major stories of the 2007 pre-season involved both of Holden's most supported teams, being the Holden Racing Team and the HSV Dealer Team. Both teams temporarily had their TEGA licences revoked meaning they would not be able to compete in the championship. This was due to issues relating to the ownership of both teams. This problem related to the ownership of the teams, where under V8 Supercar regulations, one person can only own one team. Officially, Mark Skaife owns HRT and John Kelly (father of Todd and Rick) owns HSV Dealer Team, however the close relationship between the two teams and the presence of Tom Walkinshaw in both teams clouded the ownership of both teams. The teams had their licenses reinstated temporarily pending the presentation of documents proving the ownership of each team to TEGA. On the 22 February 2007, the HSV Dealer Team produced the required documents and has been fully reinstated to the championship, and HRT was cleared to race on 27 February 2007 after satisfying TEGA that Mark Skaife is the true owner of the team.
Teams and drivers.
The following teams and drivers contested the 2007 V8 Supercar season. Drivers are numbered as per the official 2007 entry list listed on the V8 Supercar website.

Ali ibn Mohammed al-Jurjani

Ali ibn Mohammed al-Jurjani (1339–1414) (Persian ) was a Persian encyclopedic writer and traditionalist theologian. He was born near Astarabad and became a professor in Shiraz. When this city was plundered by Timur (1387) he moved to Samarkand, but returned to Shiraz in 1405, and remained there until his death.
Of his thirty-one extant works, many being commentaries on other works, one of the best known is the "Taʿrīfāt" (تعريفات "Definitions"), which was edited by G Flügel (Leipzig, 1845), published also in Constantinople (1837), Cairo (1866, etc.), and St Petersburg (1897).

Hand eczema

Hand eczema presents on the palms and soles, and may sometimes be difficult or impossible to differentiate from atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and psoriasis, which also commonly involve the hands. Even a biopsy of all these conditions may not result in a definitive diagnosis, as all three conditions may demonstrate spongiosis and crusting on the hands.
Non-communicable inflammation of the skin of the hands is referred to as Hand eczema. Hand eczema is widely prevalent "(see epidemiology)" and, as it is a very visible condition associated with severe itching or pain, has serious consequences for the affected person including a high psychological impact "(see symptoms and complaints)". Different disease patterns can be identified according to the course of the illness, appearance of symptoms, degree of severity, or catalysts ("see causes and types of illness"). Prognosis is hard to predict for individual cases of chronic hand eczema and usually differs from patient to patient. Successful treatment depends on determining the causes of the condition, obtaining an accurate diagnosis ("see diagnosis and sensible examinations, differential diagnoses"), sustainable hand protection procedures and an early, extensive, and where appropriate internal treatment ("see treatment ").
Epidemiology.
Hand eczema is a common condition: study data indicates a one-year prevalence of up to 10% in the general population. It is estimated that only 50 - 70% of people affected consult a doctor. The frequency of severe, chronic and recurrent forms of hand eczema is estimated at 5 - 7%. Approx. 2 - 4% of hand eczema patients also report that external (topical) therapy is insufficient. Several factors adversely affect the long-term prognosis, including the development of the condition prior to the 20th birthday, the severity of initial manifestations and eczema during childhood. Women, especially those under 30, are more frequently affected than men.
Signs and symptoms.
Normally, skin inflammation connected with hand eczema is accompanied by blister formation and pronounced itching, but solid calluses and painful tearing may also occur. The quality of life of the affected person is seriously diminished, especially in the case of chronic forms of the illness, and psychological impact is often very high. This impact is enhanced by the high visibility of the illness on the hands, which may lead to feelings of shame and fear of rejection.
Causes and types of illness.
There are a number of different causes of skin inflammation of the hands, the interplay of which is also significant: environmental factors such as excessive water; contact with allergens or irritants; and genetic disposition. A single catalyst is seldom responsible for the development of hand eczema in patients.
Differences according to catalysts.
Three main factors play an essential role in the development of chronic hand eczema: excessive contact with water and irritants (cumulative-toxic stress), contact with allergens, and atopic diathesis, which has a genetic component. Individual hand eczema types are identified and named according to the main catalysts involved, i.e. cumulative-toxic, contact-allergenic, or atopic hand eczema. Activities that are stressful for the skin or involve repeated, excessive contact with water or skin-irritating substances at work or home can cause damage to the skin's protective abilities and increase the chances of inflammation. This also applies to prolonged wearing of protective rubber gloves and similar materials, since sweating occurs within these gloves. Disturbance of the skin's protective barrier also facilitates penetration by allergenic substances and promotes the development of contact dermatitis. Contact allergies play a very important role in the development of hand eczema. If the hand is subjected to repeated contact with a substance that leads to an allergy, the skin reacts with signs of inflammation. Numerous people affected by hand eczema also experience skin inflammation on their feet. Often, a contact allergy to an ingredient in shoe leather treatment may be the catalyst. Contact allergies in certain types of employment are especially problematic, particularly if the work involves the handling of allergenic materials, e.g. masonry work or hairdressing.
Severe and chronic eczema qualifies as one of the most frequent occupational illnesses. Patients should therefore be referred to an occupational-dermatological specialist as soon as possible. Patients with a history of neurodermitis, hay fever, or allergic asthma often develop hand eczema. These sicknesses reflect the individual's particular susceptibility or genetic predisposition to react over-sensitively to various environmental influences. This is described as atopy or atopy diathesis. Atopic diathesis is frequently accompanied by genetically conditioned problems with the skin's protective barriers, which causes a weakening of the skin's resistance against irritating substances and moisture, as well as easier penetration by allergens, which may lead to the development of contact allergies.
Differences according to prevailing signs of skin illness (morphology).
The clinical appearance of various subtypes of hand eczema differs. The term dyshidrotic hand eczema is used to describe formations that mainly exhibit pronounced, itching blister formations, while callus and tear formations typically indicate hyperkeratotic fissured hand eczema.
Differences according to degree of severity and course.
Independent of the triggering cause or the prevailing signs of skin illness, the selection and planning of treatment options is important, since different types of illness also differ in terms of their degree of severity and the course of the illness. While light hand eczema heals relatively quickly following dermatological therapy and patient participation, more pronounced hand eczema may persist over several weeks. Severe hand eczema is characterised by consistent or recurring, extended inflammation of the skin that severely affects the patient. Hand eczema is described as chronic if it lasts at least 3 months in spite of dermatological treatment or if it recurs at least twice within a period of 12 months (relapsed) . Severe and chronic patterns of hand eczema are often resilient to treatment, making the condition extremely stressful for those affected.
Diagnosis.
During diagnosis it is important to determine the type of hand eczema and plan specific treatment accordingly. An additional diagnosis of allergies will indicate whether contact allergies or atopy diathesis are the cause of the hand eczema. Discussion concerning frequency of contact with water, irritants, and allergens in private and professional environments will also help evaluate individual stresses on the patient's skin. The hands may also exhibit various other skin illnesses and potential fungal infection or psoriasis must be ruled out. Usually, taking the patient’s personal history into account will help provide an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment.
Hand eczema is a complex condition and treatment should only be administered by a dermatologist with specialist knowledge. For any patient and their dermatologist, treatment of hand eczema may be very costly. Treatment should follow certain basic principles, and chronic and severe cases of hand eczema in particular require complex treatment concepts. Besides skin care, hand protection, and external (topical) applications with preparations containing effective ingredients or light therapy, an internal (systemic) therapy may be considered.
Avoidance of catalysts, basic procedures, and skin protection.
First of all, catalysts for the development of chronic hand eczema, such as skin-irritating damage, excessive contact with water or proven allergenic substances, must be strictly removed and avoided. Treatment of every type of hand eczema and degree of severity must include sustainable replenishment of the natural oils and moisture contained in the skin with creams and salves free of fragrances and preservatives; this is an essential basic step. In addition, protection procedures developed especially for the individual's skin stresses must be applied, e.g. use of cotton or hypoallergenic plastic gloves. Depending on the individual's own needs, these procedures should continue after the hand eczema heals, since they will also have a preventative effect.
External treatment.
External treatment should be oriented primarily according to the prevailing signs of illness. In the case of blister forming, drying treatments such as hand baths containing synthetic tannins or oily-moist preparations may hinder itching. If callus development exhibiting tear formation is present, the focus should be on softening the skin with preparations containing urea or salicylic acid. In order to reduce inflammation, creams and salves containing cortisone are often very effective. However, severe and chronic cases seldom respond sufficiently and require long periods of treatment which can increase the risk of side effects occurring. In individual cases, and especially in case of atopic hand eczema, the dermatologist may prefer to use cortisone-free, anti-inflammatory creams or salves, which include so-called "calcineurin inhibitors" tacrolimus or pimecrolimus.
Phototherapy.
Phototherapy can be effective in the treatment of chronic hand eczema. However, not all dermatologists or dermatology clinics offer this form of therapy, and it involves extended periods of treatment for the patient. A period of four to six weeks should involve 3 - 4 radiation sessions. The most frequently applied form of light therapy is PUVA therapy. This first treats the hands with a cream that contains an ingredient that causes the skin to become light-sensitive, the hands are then irradiated with ultraviolet A light (UV-A). After two days of treatment, a pause of one day must occur. Due to possible risks such as premature skin aging or chronic light damage caused to the skin, phototherapy cannot be considered for the long term.
Systemic treatment.
Besides skin care, skin protection, and an external treatment, severe and chronic cases of hand eczema often also require systemic treatment. Various preparations are available for this. For acute, severe episodes exhibiting blister formation, internal cortisone preparations, sometimes in combination with certain antibiotics, may be helpful in the short term. The active agent ciclosporin, which is approved for treatment of severely pronounced neurodermitis, may also be used for severe, atopic hand eczema. Other substances that suppress the immune system have also shown effectiveness in some cases. However, these substances are not approved for hand eczema.
In the last couple of years an internal medicine has been approved for the first time for the treatment of chronic hand eczema. This involves a derivative of vitamin A, called alitretinoin, which is also naturally present in the human body. Alitretinoin can be used to treat all forms of severe chronic hand eczema which have not reacted to external cortisone preparations. The effectiveness of this form of treatment has been tested extensively in clinical study programs and proven prior to its approval. The trial results showed that two thirds of patients did not suffer a recurrence 6 months after application of the medication, and that re-treatment is effective if hand eczema reoccurs. The duration of alitretinoin treatment is 3 to 6 months. During treatment and one month prior to beginning and one month after completion, women of childbearing-age must use contraceptives and also test for pregnancy each month since, as with all derivatives of vitamin A, the substance involved is teratogenic. Side effects mainly include temporary headaches during the initial days of treatment, as well as a possible increase in blood fat and cholesterol values. Regular laboratory tests of blood values are recommended to monitor this.

Al-Asadi v. Bush

Al-Asadi v. Bush (Civil Action No. 05-cv-2197) is a writ of habeas corpus filed on behalf of Guantanamo detainee Mohammed Ahmed Ali Al Asadi before US District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy. It was one of over 200 habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of detainees held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. 
Military Commissions Act.
The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.
Cited in other habeas petitions.
Kennedy's ruling, lifting a stay imposed upon habeas petitions in 2005, pending the resolution of Boumediene v. Bush, was cited in several other habeas petitions.
Boumediene v. Bush.
On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.
The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of "enemy combatant".
Re-initiation.
Al Asidi's petition was renewed, as a former captive seeking relief for his former detention.
On July 3, 2008, US District Court Judge Thomas F. Hogan issued an order regarding former Guantanamo captives, who might seek relief for their former detentions.
That order gave their attorneys until July 14 to respond with a brief status report, if they wanted to continue to proceed.
Al Asadi's habeas petition was one of those on Justice Hogan's list.
On July 9, 2008, Zachary Katznelson filed a statement summarizing the status of this petition, and several others.
On July 14, 2008, Andrew I. Warden, a department of Justice official, submitted a motion requesting this and other petitions be dismissed.

Hull & Newcastle.
In 1998 Temu made the move to the Hull Sharks and the Super League. Temu played 15 games for the club that year.
In 1999 Temu moved to Australia and joined the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League competition. His time at the club was plagued by injury and over two seasons he only played 3 first grade games. He was released at the end of 2000.
World Cup & Warriors.
At the end of 2000 Temu was selected in the Cook Island team for the World Cup and was made vice-captain of the squad.
The Wigan Warriors were interested in signing Temu, who did not count as a quota player due to the time he had spent in Great Britain. However he was denied a work permit due to the little game time he had had at Newcastle and so the deal fell through.
Instead, Temu signed with the new New Zealand Warriors club and provided experience to the younger props in the side. When not selected by the first grade side he played for the Marist Richmond Brothers in the Bartercard Cup. He played four first grade games for the Warriors and subsequently decided to retire at the end of the 2001 season.

SECAN Courlis

__NOTOC__
The SECAN SUC-10 Courlis (en: Curlew) was a French high-wing touring monoplane designed and built by Société d'Etudes et de Construction Aéronavales (SECAN) a branch of the automobile company Société des Usines Chaussons. The aircraft had problems with the engine installation and only 144 were built, some without engines and were scrapped.
Development.
The Courlis was an all-metal high-wing cantilever monoplane with twin booms supporting a tail unit. It was powered by a 190hp (142kW) Mathis G8R piston engine mounted in the rear fuselage in a pusher configuration. It had a fixed tricycle landing gear and had four seats in the enclosed cabin. The prototype, registered "F-WBBF", first flew on 9 May 1946. Production was started and a total of 144 aircraft were completed with a number being exported to South America. Problems with the engine resulted in the withdrawal of the engines type certificate and some airframes were never fitted with an engine and scrapped. The company did test fit the aircraft with a 220hp (164kW) Mathis engine but production was ended.
The aircraft flew for some years, owned by French private pilots, but by the mid-1950s, most had been withdrawn from service, with many being stored at Mitry-Mory airfield near Paris.
In 1961 the design was revised as the SUC-11G Super Courlis with a 240hp (179kW) Continental O-470M engine, but was abandoned after a prototype was built.
Aircraft on display.
One aircraft is held by the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace, Le Bourget, Paris, France, but is not currently (2007) on public display.

History of the Bay Area Rapid Transit

Bay Area Rapid Transit widely known by the acronym BART is the main rail transportation system for the San Francisco Bay Area. It was envisioned as early as 1946 but the construction of the original system began in the 1960s.
Origins and planning.
The idea of an underwater electric rail tube was first proposed in the early 1900s by Francis "Borax" Smith. It is no coincidence that much of BART's current coverage area was once served by the electrified streetcar and suburban train network called the Key System. This early twentieth century system once had regular trans-bay traffic across the lower deck of the Bay Bridge. By the 1950s the entire system had been dismantled in favor of automobiles and buses and the explosive growth of highway construction.
There were also plans for a third-rail powered subway line "(Twin Peaks Tunnel)" under Market Street in the 1910s.
Proposals for the modern rapid transit system now in service began in 1946 by Bay Area business leaders concerned with increased post-war migration and growing congestion in the region. An Army-Navy task force concluded that an additional trans-bay crossing would soon be needed and recommended a tunnel; however, actual planning for a rapid transit system did not begin until the 1950s. In 1951, California's legislature created the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission to study the Bay Area's long-term transportation needs. The commission's 1957 final report concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a high-speed rapid rail system linking the cities and suburbs. Nine Bay Area counties were included in the initial planning commission.
The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District was formed by the state legislature in 1957, comprising the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo. Because Santa Clara County opted instead to first concentrate on its Expressway System, that county was not included in the original BART District. 
In 1959 a bill was passed in the state legislature that provided for the entire cost of construction of the tube to be paid for with surplus toll revenues from the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge. This represented a significant portion of the total cost of the system. 
By 1961 a final plan for the new system was sent to the boards of supervisors of each of the five counties. The system's initial plans were for four lines connecting Concord in the east, Richmond in the northeast, Fremont in the southeast, Palo Alto in the southwest, and Novato in the north-west. However, in April 1962 San Mateo County made the decision to opt out, citing high costs, existing service provided by Southern Pacific commuter trains, and concerns over shoppers leaving their county for stores in San Francisco. Marin County followed soon thereafter in May. Marin was forced out of the BART district because of engineering objections from the board of directors of the Golden Gate Bridge. BART officials refused to allow Marin supervisors to stay in the district because they were afraid Marin voters would not approve the bonds, which had to win more than 60% approval. The BART plans were finally approved by the voters of the three remaining participating counties in November 1962.
In the 1980s planning was underway for extension south from San Francisco, the first step being the Daly City Tailtrack Project, upon which turnaround project the San Francisco Airport Extension would later build.
BART has been featured in a number of films including: the unfinished Transbay Tube in THX 1138; The Domino Principle, wherein Gene Hackman's character is on a train at the Fruitvale station; a fight scene in Predator 2; and The Pursuit of Happyness, which showed numerous BART stations including a fictional one in Duboce Park that prompted complaints that the new station only had one entrance, this entrance was in reality a set design for the film. The system has also been showed in other films but has played a less significant role such as being in the background as in The Kite Runner, They Call Me MISTER Tibbs!, Eye for an Eye, and Kuffs. Mission District stations were also used in at least one episode of The Streets of San Francisco. In addition to feature films there is an "underground earthquake simulator" at Universal Studios Hollywood that uses a BART train.
Construction of the initial system.
BART construction officially began on June 19, 1964 with President Lyndon Johnson presiding over the ground-breaking ceremonies at the test track between Concord and Walnut Creek in Contra Costa County. 
The enormous tasks to be undertaken were daunting. System wide projects would include the construction of three underground rail stations in Oakland's populated downtown area, four stations through San Francisco’s downtown beneath Market Street, as well as four other underground stations in other parts of San Francisco, three subterranean stations in Berkeley (which paid more to bury them, in contrast to the stations in neighboring Oakland and El Cerrito), the tunnel through the Berkeley Hills; and of course the Transbay Tube between Oakland and San Francisco beneath the San Francisco Bay. Constructed in 57 sections, "The Tube" is the world's longest and deepest immersed tunnel at cost $180 million and was completed in August 1969.
Peter Hall, author of the book "Great Planning Disasters", describes BART as one of the sensational planning disasters of the 20th century, alongside the Anglo-French Concorde and the Sydney Opera House.
BART's initial cost was $1.6 billion, which included both the initial system and the Transbay Tube. Adjusted for inflation, this cost would be valued at $15 billion in 2004.
Operation.
BART began service on September 11, 1972, reporting more than 100,000 passengers in its first five days. The Market Street Subway opened in 1973 and the Transbay Tube finally opened on September 16, 1974, linking the four branches to Daly City, Concord, Richmond, and Fremont. Service then was still 14 hours a day, and for five years BART operated weekday-only: Saturday trains began November 1977 and Sunday in July 1978. Fare in 1972-74 was $1.20 from Concord or $1.25 from Fremont to any station west of the bay; Richmond to Fremont was $1.10. 
The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake severed the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge for a month and destroyed the Cypress Street Viaduct. With some Bay Area freeways damaged or destroyed, BART trains, within six hours of the earthquake, were again running. Even with service interruptions following aftershocks for inspection of tracks, over- and under-crossings, and tunnels, BART continued to run. 
Expansion was made possible by an agreement under which San Mateo County was to contribute $200 million to East Bay extensions as a “"buy-in"” to the system without actually joining the BART district. Trains to North Concord/Martinez began on December 16, 1995 and to Pittsburg/Bay Point on December 7, 1996. Service south of Daly City began on February 24, 1996, to Colma. On May 10, 1997 service began from Bay Fair to Castro Valley and Dublin/Pleasanton. The Dublin/Pleasanton extension now has transbay trains, but it was planned to have just shuttle trains between Dublin/Pleasanton and Bay Fair.
Labor.
BART workers are currently organized in 4 unions: the Service Employees International Union Local 1021, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3333, and the BART Police Officer's Association.
1976 strike
BART has a unionized work force that went on strike for two weeks in 1976 in solidarity with the BART Police Officers Association. During the 1970s BART union workers received quarterly cost of living increases. 
1979 lockout/strike
In 1979 there was a 90 day lockout by management, or a strike by union workers, depending on who one believes. Trains ran during this period because one of the unions, AFSCME, was then only an informal association known as BARTSPA, and management and BARTSPA had enough staff to keep trains running. One result of this strike is that the cost-of-living increases were greatly reduced to an amount far below the Consumer Price Index, and such raises are only received if no other raise occurs in a particular year.
1997 strike
For six days in September 1997, a BART strike caused a system-wide shutdown. This resulted in a four-year contract offering a 7% raise, and a one-time payment of $3,000 to all employees in lieu of a raise the first year. Such one-time payments are becoming more common as a way to prevent the effects of compounding on wages and salaries.
In addition, BART began large scale layoffs of rank and file workers, increasing the workload on those remaining.
2001 negotiations
In its 2001 negotiations, the BART unions fought for, and won, a 24 percent wage increase over four years with continuing benefits for employees and retirees.
2005 negotiations
Another threatened strike on July 6, 2005 was averted by a last-minute agreement between management and the unions. In this agreement, Union workers received a 7% raise over four years, and paid an increase in the cost of medical insurance. The net increase (3%) was well below inflation, which was about 10% cumulative (about 2.4% per year) over the period of the contract. 
The net increase was also below the average private sector raise, which was 4.6% for 2006.
2009 negotiations
The outcome of the 2009 contract negotiations were a four-year wage freeze, reduced pensions, and changes to work rules. 
These new terms provided a $100 million savings to BART from 2009 to 2013. 
2013 strikes
BART employees went on strike on July 1, 2013, over pay and safety issues. The strike was ended July 5, when both sides agreed to a 30-day cooling off period (which ended Monday, August 5).
A second strike began on Friday, October 18, 2013, over unresolved compensation and work rule issues. Management offered a 12% wage increase over 4 years, of which 4% would be taken back as an increase in the required pension contribution; 9.5% increase in healthcare premiums, and changes to work rules including fewer fixed work schedules. Unions were willing to accept the financial terms but requested binding arbitration for the work rules. Management refused the arbitration offer.
Awards.
In October 2004 BART received the American Public Transportation Association's "Outstanding Public Transportation System Award" for 2004 in the category of transit systems with 30 million or more annual passenger trips.
BART issued announcements and began a promotional campaign declaring that it had been named "Number One Transit System in America". In 2006 the same industry trade group presented BART with the token AdWheel award for 'creative approaches to marketing transit' in recognition for BART's development of an iPod-based trip planner.
Incidents and accidents.
There have been no accidents attributed to brake failure. The following incidents are known to have occurred on the BART system:
Lines.
Current lines.
Trains regularly operate on five routes. Unlike most other rapid transit and rail systems around the world, BART lines are generally not referred to by shorthand designations. Although the lines have been colored consistently on BART system maps since inception, they are only occasionally referred to officially by color names. However, future train cars will display line colors more prominently.
BART announcements refer to by their destination(s) (e.g., “"Richmond train"” or “"Richmond-bound train"”). Electronic destination signs add “"San Francisco"” to the destination of any westbound transbay train or eastbound train west of San Francisco to make it clear that it will be passing through the city, and “"SFO Airport"” (or just “"SFO"”) is added to any train going to the airport. This can cause cumbersome descriptions, such as “"San Francisco/Daly City train"”, “"San Francisco/SFO Airport/Millbrae train"”, and “"San Francisco/Pittsburg/Bay Point train".” On evenings and weekends, the longest name is “"SFO Airport/San Francisco/Pittsburg/Bay Point"," Only the first car of each train carries a destination sign, but all platforms have displays showing the destination of each train, with voice announcements.
In many places in the BART system, multiple lines merge and share stations and tracks. Four lines share the Transbay Tube, all San Francisco stations, the Daly City Station and West Oakland Station. During peak hours multiple lines vie for track space. Only 4½ trains per hour per line (18 total trains per hour through the Tube) can be achieved after headways and dwell times are accounted for. The lack of passing tracks or sidings makes for challenging recoveries from traffic delays.
Defunct lines.
In 1996, when the I-680/State Route 24 interchange in Walnut Creek was overhauled for construction, BART added temporary commuter train service during rush hours, which ran between South Hayward and Concord stations. The service ceased when the interchange was finished.
At the time when the BART-SFO Extension opened on June 22, 2003, there was a "Millbrae–SFO Line", a shuttle line that operated every 20 minutes between Millbrae and San Francisco Airport, formerly depicted as a purple line. This line has been defunct as of February 2004. It was replaced by the Dublin/Pleasanton–Millbrae line that stopped at SFO Station on its way to Millbrae. On January 1, 2008, this service was completely eliminated; passengers traveling from points south to the airport have to board a train at Millbrae, travel to San Bruno, and then take a different train back to the airport. Direct service to SFO from Millbrae was finally restored in September 2009, but only Monday to Friday after 7 p.m. and all day Saturday and Sunday, via the off-peak Pittsburg/Bay Point–SFO/Millbrae line; during weekday peak hours SFO passengers from Millbrae still have to travel to and transfer at San Bruno station in order to reach SFO.
Automation.
BART was one of the first U.S. systems of any size to have substantial automated operations. The trains are computer-controlled via BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at Lake Merritt and generally arrive with regular punctuality. Train operators duties may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
As a first-generation system, BART's automation system was plagued with numerous operational problems during its first years of service. Shortly after revenue service began, an on-board electronics failure caused one two-car test train (with car 143 as the lead car) to run off the end of the elevated track at the Fremont station and into a parking lot. This incident was dubbed the "Fremont Flyer", and there were no serious injuries. When revenue service began, "ghost trains" (or false occupancies), trains that show up on the computer system as being in a specific place but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system, as a result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 volts rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for train detection. Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of . Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these "ghost trains" (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking — operators in a booth on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights — that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years.
The original signaling technology and subsequent enhancements used to control the trains was developed by Westinghouse.
During this initial shakedown period, there were several episodes where trains had to be manually run and signaled via station agents communicating by telephone. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation among Westinghouse, the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the state government (advised by University of California professor Dr. Bill Wattenburg), the federal government, and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service. Ghost trains apparently still persist on the system to this day and are usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, but occasionally some can cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system. In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.
San Francisco International Airport extension.
The $1.5 billion extension of BART southward to San Francisco International Airport's (SFO) Garage G, adjacent to the International Terminal, was opened to the public on June 22, 2003. Ground was broken on the project in November 1997, adding four new stations including the SFO station, South San Francisco, San Bruno, and Millbrae. The Millbrae station has a cross-platform connection to Caltrain, the first of its kind west of the Mississippi. The airport extension used to run from SFO to Millbrae station, and operated with two train operators—one on each end of the train—between the San Bruno and Millbrae stations to reduce dwell time at SFO during peak hours; the train entered the SFO stub-end station under the control of the primary operator and exited in the opposite direction towards Millbrae controlled by the secondary. Since SFO is now the terminus of the line that serves it, this practice was discontinued as it would not reduce the in-transit time for any trips.
The airport extension project added of new railway; of subway, of aerial, and of at-grade track. The launch point was the Daly City Tailtrack project, which extended the tracks further south of the existing terminus in San Francisco and was completed in the 1980s.
The project has not been without problems, however. The SFO extension currently draws 35,107 daily riders, significantly less than its target of 50,000 average weekday riders. Another significant problem of note had been the rocky relationship between BART and San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) which was not a part of the BART district, but by agreement was responsible for the extension's operating costs. Fueled by the reality that the extension was not paying for itself, the acrimony between BART and SamTrans over changes and reductions in bus and train service reached a high. 
BART wanted to increase service to attract ridership, while SamTrans wanted to reduce service to trim costs. Thus, service along the extension was changed several times.
Eventually SamTrans and BART worked out a deal in which SamTrans paid BART $32 million, plus approximately $2 million a year, and BART assumed all costs and control of operating the extension. The latest revision to the SFO service has Pittsburg-Bay Point trains running to SFO at all times. During peak times, Richmond trains will run to Millbrae, with Dublin-Pleasanton trains terminating at Daly City, and during off-peak hours (nights and weekends), Dublin-Pleasanton trains will run to Millbrae (replacing Richmond service on the extension). Consequently, the new routing requires passengers connecting between San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport to make an additional transfer. In addition, the cessation of direct BART service between Millbrae and SFO requires Caltrain passengers wanting to travel to the airport to make an additional transfer at San Bruno Station.
Many critics of the SFO Extension contend the project was merely a cover for BART's ultimate goal of ringing the bay, eliminating Caltrain altogether.
The most use the new line has gotten on any single day was 37,200; the SFO Station receives an average of 10,700 passengers daily.

Zé Ramalho Canta Bob Dylan – Tá Tudo Mudando is the second tribute album by Brazilian singer-songwriter Zé Ramalho, released in 2008. This time, he pays an homage to Bob Dylan, whose "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" had already been covered by him. Most of the songs' lyrics were almost literally rewritten to Portuguese. The album cover is a reference to Dylan's known promotional film clip for the 1965 song "Subterranean Homesick Blues". "O Vento Vai Responder", a cover of "Blowin' in the Wind", was used in the soundtrack of the Rede Globo telenovela, "Caminho das Índias".
The album was nominated for the 2009 Latin Grammy Award for Best Brazilian Rock Album., but lost it to "Agora" by NX Zero and "Sacos Plásticos" by Titãs, who shared the prize.
Before recording, all the covers were taken by Sony Music Brazil president, Aloysio Reis, to the United States, so that Dylan and his staff could listen to it. Dylan reportedly approved all versions "with praise" All songs are sung in Portuguese, except "If Not for You". Ramalho says he thought that ""covering a song like this one, singing in the natural language and arranging it the way I did, with a galloping northeastern rhythm, it would be interesting, and I think it was! This arrangement is also inspired by the recording of this song that George Harrison did in his album" All Things Must Pass".""

The Allmusic review by John Bush awarded the album four stars and said that "Recorded just after Sarah Vaughan joined the Roulette label...The Divine One found her in exactly the right circumstances to suit her excellent talents. Arranged by Jimmy Jones...the setting was a small group that included one strong voice to accentuate hers - and no less a strong and clear voice than trumpeter Harry "Sweets" Edison (the perfect accompaniment for Vaughan). Roulette would soon push Vaughan in many different directions - releasing over a dozen LPs in just a few short years - but this small-group date is a gem".

RNLB Louisa Heartwell (ON 495)

The "Louisa Heartwell" ON 495 was the sixth lifeboat to be stationed at Cromer on the coast of the English county of Norfolk She was launched from the beach station and was on station from 1902 to 1932. During her period on station at Cromer the "Louisa Heartwell" had only two coxswains during her 29-year career. The coxswains were Matthew James "Buttons" Harrison until his retirement in 1909, and then Henry George Blogg.
New lifeboat house.
With the arrival of the new Liverpool-type lifeboat "Louisa Heartwell", Cromer also got a new lifeboat house. This was needed as the new lifeboat and her carriage were much larger than the previous lifeboat "Benjamin Bond Cabbell" ON 12. The new lifeboat house was opened in 1902 and remained in use until the 1960s, when it then became the lifeboat museum. With the advent of the new Henry Blogg Museum, this building is once again a lifeboat house, and is used by Cromer's inshore lifeboat
Notable rescues.
Steamship "Fernebo".
The Swedish cargo steamer was laden with timber when on 9 January 1917 an explosion in the ship's boiler broke the "Ferebo" in two. The Cromer Lifeboat "Louise Heartwell" with coxswain Henry Blogg at the helm had been at sea for several hours in difficult conditions attending the Greek steamer "Pyrin". Blogg and his exhausted crew were now asked to attend the "Fernebo". The sea conditions were so bad that the lifeboat was unable to clear the beach. Meanwhile the crew of the "Fernebo" had managed to launch a small boat from the stricken vessel. Aboard were six crew members but the little boat was capsized in the surf. All six of the little boat's occupants were rescued from the waves through efforts of rescuers on the beach. In the late afternoon the "Fernebo's" two halves had grounded. One half was alongside a wooden groyne with the other, half a mile to the east. After failed attempts to make a further rescue with rocket apparatus the "Louise Heartwell" launched again at 9:30 pm. During this attempt the lifeboat lost three oars and five of her oars were smashed. Not to be beaten, once more with spare oars and after some rest, "Blogg" and his crew launched to the "Fernebo". This time the lifeboat managed to get alongside the wreck long enough to rescue the eleven remaining crewmen. The lifeboat returned to the shore at 1:00 am to a cheering crowd who had stayed to watch the rescue from the beach. Henry Blogg and his crew had been at sea for fourteen hours. For this action Henry Blogg received a RNLI gold medal. Acting second Coxswain "William Davies" was awarded the Silver medal and twelve of the crew were awarded the Bronze medal. This was the first time this new medal had been awarded and had been specifically created because of the notable contribution made to this rescue by the crewmen of the "Louisa Heartwell". The wreck of the "Fernebo" was not removed from Cromer Beach until 1922.

Derby du Rhône

The Derby du Rhône (, "Rhône Derby"; also referred to as the Derby des Rhône-Alpes or simply Le Derby) is a football match contested between French clubs Olympique Lyonnais and AS Saint-Étienne. Both clubs are located in the region of Rhône-Alpes. Saint Etienne, though, does not stand near the Rhône river nore belongs to the Rhône département. It rather belongs to the Loire département, taking its name from another famous French river, the Loire. Saint Etienne fans thus insist that the Derby's and rivalry's name is incorrect, although it is widely used in French media.
The two clubs first met in 1951 and, due to the each club's close proximity towards each other being separated by only , a hotly contested rivalry developed. The Derby du Rhône is cited as one of the high-points of the Ligue 1 season and, like other major rivalries, extends outside of the pitch. The rivalry is locally considered a symbolic challenge between the two cities, as the city of Lyon is considered white collar while its counterpart Saint-Étienne is viewed by the locals as more blue collar.
The derby also pits the recently most successful French club (Lyon) against the formerly biggest French club (Saint-Étienne). During the 20th century, Saint-Étienne was the most successful club in French football winning ten league titles between 1957–1981, a record that still stands today. During that span, the club also won six Coupe de France titles and performed well at European level. However, following the club's relegation to the second division in 1984, Saint-Étienne's stranglehold on the football scene in France began to dwindle. Lyon began a similar ascension into French football at the beginning of the new millennium when the club won their first-ever Ligue 1 championship in 2002. The initial title started a national record-breaking streak of seven successive titles, a streak unmatched in French football history. Lyon have also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League, a feat that hasn't been matched by a French club since 2004 when AS Monaco reached the final.
Switching clubs.
Due to the clubs' ongoing rivalry, few players have played for both Lyon and Saint-Étienne. Since the two clubs first contested each other in 1951, only 27 players have played for both Lyon and Saint-Étienne and only 13 players have transferred directly from Lyon to Saint-Étienne and vice-versa. The first player to "commit" the offense was Antoine Rodriguez in 1951, when after having a nine-year spell at Saint-Étienne, he moved to Lyon, where he spent only one season. Other notable players who made the switch were Aimé Jacquet who, after having a successful 13-year career with Saint-Étienne, departed the club for Lyon, where he spent three seasons. Jacquet later went on to manage Lyon and coached the team to the 1973 Coupe de France Final. Similarly, striker Bernard Lacombe established himself as one of Lyon's all-time leading goalscorers before leaving the club for Saint-Étienne in 1978 where he was often booed and jeered, which led to the player departing the club for Bordeaux after one season. The other players who transferred directly between clubs are François Lemasson, Alain Moizan, Andre Calligaris, Romarin Billong, Jean-Luc Sassus, Christopher Deguerville, Grégory Coupet, Franck Priou, Lamine Diatta, and Bafétimbi Gomis.

Wiere Brothers

The Wiere Brothers were a comedy team who appeared in 1930s and 1940s films, and as live performers from the 1920s to the late 1960s. 
The names of the three brothers were:
The Wiere Brothers were vaudeville performers who occasionally appeared in films and television. Their films include "Hands Across the Border" in 1944 with Roy Rogers, "Road to Rio" in 1947 with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, and "Double Trouble" in 1967 as three detectives on the hunt for Elvis Presley. In 1962, the Wiere Brothers had their own TV series called "Oh, Those Bells!" that aired on CBS. The show was created by Jules White who had previously directed The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, and Andy Clyde in short-subject films for Columbia Pictures. "Oh, Those Bells!" included a lot of slapstick comedy but only 13 episodes were aired. The team was still appearing on television in 1970 on shows such as "The Merv Griffin Show" and "Laugh-In" and were still touring the same year. But after Sylvester's death in July 1970, Harry and Herbert Wiere discontinued their act. Harry Wiere did make one appearance on the TV series Bionic Woman in 1976 as the Tipsy Man.
One of their popular acts of the 1960s involved the three brothers playing the violin, guitar and bass fiddle. Herbert would try to do a serious number on the violin but would get frustrated with his brothers' hillbilly antics. With a shrug, Herbert would stop playing and decide to balance the violin on his chin. Harry would then notice Herbert's accomplishment and would take the guitar and balance it on his chin. This left Sylvester smiling blandly at the audience, still plucking his bass fiddle. When Sylvester sees Herbert and Harry balancing their instruments on their chins, he would do a long take, turning from his brothers to his huge bass fiddle and then back at them. Then, finally Sylvester would lift the bass fiddle in the air and balance it on his chin for the finale.
Inga Wiere, a sister of Herbert, Harry and Sylvester Wiere, was married to dancer Jon Zerby. Together they were known as The Dancing Zerbys, a successful nightclub act in the 1940s and 1950s. Actress and dancer Kim Darby is their daughter.

Papuan Infantry Battalion

The Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army formed on 27 May 1940 in the territory of Papua, during World War II, in order to fight the Japanese. The unit was slow in forming, with its first members posted in March 1941. By 1942 it consisted of only three companies and were all understrength and poorly equipped. PIB was soon sent forward in June 1942 to patrol the northern coast of Papua and were dispersed over a wide area, led by Australian officers and NCOs. The small parties were the first to make contact with the Imperial Japanese forces upon landing in Papua. The battalion would ultimately serve in many of the allied campaigns in New Guinea, with its soldiers becoming noted for their ferocity and tenacity against the Japanese during the Kokoda Trail campaign, Salamaua-Lae campaign, Ramu Valley-Finisterre Range campaign, Bougainville campaign and Aitape-Wewak campaign.
The battalion had an establishment of about 77 Europeans and 550 native soldiers. The PIB along with the 1st and 2nd New Guinea Infantry Battalion were amalgamated to form the Pacific Islands Regiment in November 1944. The 3rd and 4th New Guinea Infantry Battalion joined the regiment in 1945, although 4NGIB was soon disbanded, whilst the 5th New Guinea Infantry Battalion—although authorised—was never raised. The battalion was disbanded in August 1946.
