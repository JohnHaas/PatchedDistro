History.
Early history and NAIA years.
Lindenwood University football began in 1990 under head coach David Schroeder. LU competed as an independent for the first four seasons. The program's first win came in the first ever football for the university on September 8, 1990 when the Lions defeated Dana College. The Lions finished the inaugural season with a record of 6-4.
Despite a 3-5-0 start to the first half of the 1991 season, a program highlight came on October 12, 1991 when Lindenwood tied 17-17 on the road in Birmingham, Alabama with NCAA Division III Alabama-Birmingham before the UAB program upgraded to NCAA Division I. Following that game, the Lions lost the following game to Benedictine College but finished the season with a three-game win streak to finish the season 5-4-1. During the next several years of the football program, bright spots began to emerge, a couple of the original players from the first team ever at the school were named to the All American team. Hoyt Gregory made all American in 1992 and two players from the original football class Steve Pinkerton and Jim Paddock were signed and drafted into professional football. This gave the program the status that it could recruit and maintain top level athletes.
Jeff Driskill became the second coach in program history in 1992. In 1994 Lindenwood became one of the founding members of the Mid-States Football Association - Midwest League along with schools five schools from Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. After three 2-win seasons Dan Kratzer took over the program and lead the Lions to a 4-7-0 season in 1995.
In 1996 the program became a member of the Heart of America Athletic Conference. The Lions recorded back-to-back 4-6-0 seasons in 1996 and 1997. In 1998 the program saw drastic improvement when Kratzer lead the lions to an 8-2-0 regular season. Including a 34-33 win against NCAA Division I Butler University. The win marked the first and only win over an NCAA DI opponent, as LU lost 16-27 to Butler in 1997 and 6-27 to Valparaiso University in 2002. The 1996 also marked the first time Lindenwood football received a bid to the NAIA Playoffs before losing in the first round 10-12 to Southwestern College. In 2000 Kratzer lead the Lions to their first of two bowl appearances, when the Lions received a bid to the Wheat Bowl - NAIA Kickoff Classic against Concordia University (Nebraska).
Rick Gorzynski became the fourth coach in program history in 2001 and after three sub .500 season in which the Lions recorded two 3-8-0 seasons and a 1-10-0 season Patrick Ross became the fifth football coach in Lindenwood history. Ross quickly turned the program around from a 3-8-0 season in 2003 to a 11-1-0 season in his first as LU head coach in 2004. The Lions also won their first HAAC Championship after an 11-0-0 regular season, the only loss, a 19-20 loss in the opening round of the NAIA Playoffs to Hastings College.
Under Ross the Lions recorded their first playoff win in program history in the 2008 when the Lions defeated Lambuth University 65-48. That same season Lindenwood advanced to the NAIA Semifinal Game with a quarterfinal 34-31 win over Morningside College. Lindenwood would eventually be defeated by the defending NAIA National ChampionsCarroll College in the semifinal game 37-38.

LU became the NAIA national runner-up in 2009 after a 22-25 loss to University of Sioux Falls Cougars and came into the 2010 season ranked #2 in the nation in 2010 NAIA Football Coaches' Top 25 Spring Poll.
In June 2010 LU applied to join the NCAA Division II Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA), as part of the conference's expansion from 12 to 16 members for 2012. Lindenwood was approved for membership into the MIAA on September 24, 2010 with the affiliation taking place in 2012-2013 school year.

Bricket Wood coven

The Bricket Wood coven, or Hertfordshire coven was a coven of Gardnerian Witches founded in the 1940s by Gerald Gardner. It was notable for being the first coven in the Gardnerian line, though having its supposed origins in the pre-Gardnerian New Forest coven. The coven formed after Gardner bought the 
Fiveacres Country Club, a Naturist club in the village of Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, southern England, and met within the club's grounds. It played a significant part in the history of the neopagan religion of Wicca.
Many important and influential figures in Wicca were members of the coven, including Dafo, Doreen Valiente, Jack Bracelin, Frederic Lamond, Dayonis, Eleanor Bone and Lois Bourne. The coven is still active today, though it maintains secrecy and its history is only known up until the 1970s.
History.
1940s.
Gardner founded the coven around the year 1946 after moving to the area from the New Forest with his wife Donna. In the New Forest, Gardner claimed to have been initiated into the New Forest coven, where he learned the mysteries and practices of the witchcraft religion. Gardner, fearing that the "Old Religion" as he called it would die out, decided to form a new coven near to his new home, where he could initiate more people into the craft and keep it alive.
Gardner acted as the coven's High Priest, with Dafo acting as High Priestess. She had also been a member of the New Forest coven. Dafo remained a member of the coven until she left it by late 1952, annoyed at Gardner's publicity seeking.
Gardner gained several members to the coven, all of whom were either members of the Fiveacres naturist club or were already witches, although Donna, Gardner's wife, never got involved, having no interest in witchcraft. They held their meetings on the grounds of the local wooded Fiveacres nudist club, which Gardner had purchased in 1945. He was himself not interested in running the club, and as such appointed an administrator to take on the job.
Gardner re-assembled what he called the "witches' cottage" on a plot of land which he owned in the club grounds. The small cottage was decorated with magical sigils on the inside. He had purchased this building from a friend of his, the Freemason J.S.M Ward, who was a pioneer of the restoration of historical buildings. It was within this cottage that the coven assembled to perform their rituals.
1950s.
Doreen Valiente, 1953-1957.
Doreen Valiente, who Gardner had initiated into the craft at Midsummer 1953 at the home of Dafo in the New Forest, joined the coven, and rose to become High Priestess.
In 1956, Jack Bracelin was initiated into the coven by Valiente. Bracelin became a favourite of Gardner's, and he gave Bracelin the job of running the Fiveacres club after sacking the previous administrator, who "had deliberately run the club at a loss by setting unrealistically high requirements for membership, hoping thereby to persuade Gerald to eventually sell him the club at a low price". The sacked administrator had felt scorned, and convinced the president of the Central Council of British Naturism, Ernest Stanley, that the club was a cover for witchcraft, and that they should not be allowed membership to the CCOBN. Hoping to help Jack and Gardner's club out, the coven performed a ritual, and the situation was resolved.
In the mid-1950s, Gardner began to encourage more publicity, something which annoyed many coven members. In 1957, Valiente and several other coven members confronted Gardner over this, claiming that they should have a set of rules to regulate such a thing. Gardner, in response, brought about the Wiccan Laws (not to be confused with the Wiccan Rede), which offended Valiente, and in 1957 her and many of the group's older members left to form their own coven.
The split-off coven asked if they could continue to use the witches' cottage for their rituals, but in a letter Gardner replied that:
Gardner was left with a much younger coven, composed of Dayonis, her then sexual partner Jack Bracelin, Fred Lamond, a hospital anaethetist, and a new initiate.
Dayonis, 1958-1959.
With Valiente gone, Dayonis took over as the High Priestess of the coven, in January 1958. With Dayonis in charge, Gardner asked her to immediately initiate anyone who asked into the craft, in contrast with his former belief that prospective candidates should wait for a year and a day before initiation. One such of these new fast-tracked initiates was Fred Lamond, who was initiated only four months after meeting the coven for the first time. Gardner also insisted on the initiation of Eleanor Bone, despite the fact that the coven members felt that they "simply couldn't circle with her" because of differences in exuberance. Within a month, Gardner had brought about her 2nd and 3rd initiations, and set her up as the High Priestess of a new coven, independent of the Bricket Wood one.
In spring 1958, whilst Gardner was away from the coven, staying at his museum on the Isle of Man, the other members decided that did not want to continue using only binding and scourging to raise energies, and so they tried to do so by the circle dance method, which most found to be more effective than Gardner's preferred methods. At the same time, the group decided that they wanted to celebrate the solstices and the equinoxes as well as the cross-quarter days (the coven at the time called them Halloween, Candlemass, Beltane and Lammas). Gardner gave his written permission for this, and it was adopted by other practitioners of the craft, such as Doreen Valiente. This was the beginning of the belief in the Wiccan Wheel of the Year.
In October 1959, Dayonis moved to Canada, and Lois Bourne became the coven's High Priestess.
1960s.
After Gardner's death in 1964, Jack Bracelin, who had remained loyal to Gardner throughout, took over the group as High Priest. At the same time he inherited the Fiveacres club from Gardner. However he soon left the coven, and abandoned the craft, because, according to coven member Frederic Lamond, "he asked himself whether the Book of Shadows' simplified ceremonial magic rituals expressed his own religious feelings, and concluded they did not".
The coven continued to assemble at the Witches' cottage, which Bracelin allowed them to use as long as they paid rent on it. Many coven members were not happy with this, as they were not members of the nudist club, though they did so anyway.
1970s.
In 1972, the group stopped using the Witches' cottage all year round, and instead started meeting at the north London home of the High Priest and High Priestess during winter.
In 1975, Bracelin tried to get the group to pay for the nudist club's electricity as well as paying rent, which the coven members were unwilling to do, and so they sold their plot to another club member.

<doc id="20890979" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20890979" title="Delta Sigma Epsilon">
Delta Sigma Epsilon

Delta Sigma Epsilon (ΔΣΕ) was a national collegiate social sorority operating in the United States from 1914 to 1956. It was absorbed by Delta Zeta sorority.
History.
The sorority was organized at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, on September 23, 1914. Dean Harvey C. Minnich, of the College of Education, selected several young students to form this organization. He selected them based on their academic records and character. These seven ladies were Marie Cropper, Ruth Gabler, Josephine McIntire, Virginia Stark, Charlotte Stark, Opal Warning, and Louise Wolfe ( Miner, p. 148).
In 1917, the fifth chapter, Epsilon, was installed. The sorority was now admitted into the Association of Pedagogical Sororities. "From that date Delta Sigma Epsilon played a leading role in determining and perfecting the policies of that national association, later renamed Association of Education Sororities." (Miner, p. 148)
In 1940, Pi Delta Theta, a fellow associate sorority, merged with Delta Sigma Epsilon. This was the first and only merger within the Association of Education Sororities (AES) (Miner, p. 148).
In 1947, the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) granted membership to the six remaining members of the AES. The AES disbanded. ΔΣΕ was now part of the NPC.
By 1949, ΔΣΕ installed 46 chapters in "leading colleges throughout the United States" (Miner, p. 148).
In August 1956, at the conclave in New Orleans, the absorption of ΔΣΕ by Delta Zeta was announced. Several members of the ΔΣΕ Grand Council held position on their new sorority's grand council (Miner, p. 148).
Creed.
I believe in Delta Sigma Epsilon and her power to develop character, scholarship, and leadership. I believe in the highest standards of womanhood which she maintains and the close friendship which she fosters. I believe in her power to give direction to the thoughts and lives of those women who are so fortunate as to be affiliated with her. (Miner, p. 149)
Coat of arms.
"The coat of arms consisted of an olive green cream and shield with the mantle around the upper half. Seven stars, in honor of the founders, occupied the band across the shield, while the ring adorned the love green section and the Omega Phi is on the lower portion. Above the shield is the cornucopia. At the base a furled ribbon shows the inscription of Delta Sigma Epsilon in Greek letters." (Miner, p. 148)
Seal.
"The official seal was affixed to national charters and to all legal documents. It was a circle within a circle. Between the circles is the open motto of the fraternity. In the inner circle is a seven-pointed shield bearing the Greek letters ΔΣE, the friendship circle, and the cornucopia." (Miner, p. 149).
Pins.
Membership pin: "The official plain or pearl badge was a gold pin, shield shaped, having seven points, the edge being of pearls or of gold. ΔΣΕ, the friendship circle, the cornucopia, and the secret motto in gold on a black background."
Pledge pin: "...a small silver cornucopia bearing the letters ΔΣΕ"
Patroness pin: " small gold friendship circle having the letters ΔΣΕ across the center"
Mothers pin: "...black enamel and shaped like a shield. It was set with one ruby and bore the letters ΔΣΕ across the center"
Recognition pin: "a small gold cornucopia bearing the letters ΔΣΕ"
Grand Council badge: " a gold circle set with diamond circumscribing the official pin. The gold circle denoted eternal friendship and the diamonds denoted the numbers of terms of service on the Council, the maximum number limited to seven in honor of the founders."
Symbols.
The cornucopia and the friendship circle were the most prominent symbols.
The letters Omega and Phi were part of the secret motto.
The official colors were olive green and cream.
The flower was the cream tea rose.
Chapters.
Delta Sigma Epsilon was a member of the Association of Educational Sororities (AES). Its chapters were traditionally located on the campuses of normal schools or teachers' colleges.

In general, these are the major payment clearing systems or Real Time Gross Settlement of individual countries, but in the case of Europe, there are certain pan-European payment systems. TARGET2 is a pan-European SIPS dealing with major inter-bank payments. STEP2, operated by the Euro Banking Association is a major pan-European clearing system for retail payments which has the potential to become a SIPS.
In the event of a bank failure, adherence to the rules for the operation of SIPS should prevent a domino effect whereby payment obligations of the failing bank are effected against the solvent banks. Clearly, this does not prevent the effects of a bank failure from spreading; however, it closes off one route.
Operation of a SIPS.
In 2001, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) issued the "Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems", and these are summarised below. In certain banking circles, these have become known as the 10 Commandments.
In 2003 the European Central Bank (ECB) further elaborated on how the principles should be applied in Euro retail payment systems",
Subsequently, in response to the perceived increased risks of terrorist attacks, the ECB in 2006 published detailed oversight expectations for business continuity planning, greatly expanding on core principle number 7.
BIS added an additional recommendation in relation to countries which use cheques. It urged the operators of cheque clearing to have special regard to the fact that cheques may be dishonoured and returned some days after presentation, and this poses special risks. This is particularly relevant to countries such as Britain, Ireland, France, and US and should be regarded as the 11th commandment of payments.
BIS CPSS is currently preparing for the new global standards for not only payment systems but also securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories. The new standards (Principles for FMI) is now under market consultation and going to be published in 2012.
Core principles (Summary).
A Systemically Important Payment Systems (SIPS) should have:-
1...A well-founded legal basis
2...Rules & procedures which enable participants to have a clear understanding of the system’s impact on each of the financial risks they incur through participation in it.
3...Clearly defined procedures for the management of credit risks and liquidity risks, which specify the respective responsibilities of the system operator and the participants and which provide appropriate incentives to manage and contain those risks
4...Prompt final settlement on the day of value, preferably during the day and at a minimum at the end of the day.
5...Where multilateral netting takes place, it should, at a minimum be capable of ensuring the timely completion of daily settlements in the event of an inability to settle by the participant with the largest single settlement obligation
6...Assets used for settlement should preferably be a claim on the central bank; where other assets are used, they should carry little or no credit risk and little or no liquidity risk 
7...A high degree of security and operational reliability, and contingency arrangements for timely completion of daily processing
8...Practical for its users and efficient for the economy
9...Objective and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair and open access
10..Governance arrangements which are effective, accountable and transparent

Middelgrunden

Middelgrunden is an offshore wind farm in the Øresund 3.5 km
outside Copenhagen, Denmark. When it was built in 2000, it was the world's largest offshore farm, with 20 turbines and a capacity of 40 MW. The farm delivers about 4% of the power for Copenhagen.
History.
In 1996, the project was initiated by the "Copenhagen Environment and Energy Office (CEEO)" after Middelgrunden had been listed as a potential site in the Danish Action Plan for Offshore Wind. Together with the CEEO a group of local people formed the "Middelgrunden Wind Turbine Cooperative" and established a cooperation with Copenhagen Energy, the local electric utility. The proposed location was initially opposed by the Danish Society for Nature Conservation, but this decision was later changed.
Concrete gravity base foundations were chosen as the cheapest option.
Public involvement.
This project is an example for community wind energy. It is 50% owned by the 10,000 investors in the "Middelgrunden Wind Turbine Cooperative", and 50% by the municipal utility company. Being clearly visible from the capital of Denmark it states the importance of wind power in Denmark.

Carpenter's Brook Fish Hatchery is a county-maintained Fish hatchery in the town of Elbridge, New York. The fish hatchery is located along New York State Route 321, at the intersection with former New York State Route 368 (now County Route 107). The location is maintained by Onondaga County, New York's Parks commission, running full-time around the year with certain hours. Opened in 1938, it is only one of four county-maintained fish hatcheries in the state of New York at the current time. The fish hatchery produces over 70,000 trout annually. The staff of the hatchery, along with other volunteers, help fund retail sales and local fish stores with $4 million annually. 
History.
In the 19th Century, the national fish stocking system was a large need, and the national system of using fish hatcheries was started in the 1870s.
The fish hatchery was opened on its current location along NY 321 in 1938. The fish hatchery was a subsidy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a service from Onondaga County. This was started when the New Deal started the Works Progress Administration, which helped develop the project.

Tim Steed

Tim Steed (born December 30, 1957) is an American comedian, author, screenwriter, songwriter, and keynote speaker.
Biography.
Tim Steed was born December 30, 1957 in Knoxville, Tennessee. He graduated Bearden High School in 1975 and soon after joined the U.S. Army, where he was a member of the 101st Airborne Division in a combat support company. He was discharged under honorable conditions after a year and returned home to Knoxville.
He bounced around various colleges and odd jobs until he landed at Roane State Community College in Knoxville. There he discovered acting and started writing and performing stand-up comedy. He later transferred to the University of Tennessee, took as many acting and speech classes as he could and entered the university comedy contest and was deemed the runner-up for "funniest person on campus."
During his time at U.T., Steed met a group of local improvisational actors called "On the Edge" and helped take them from local theater to Public-access television. He still had a dream of doing both comedy and television on a larger scale so in 1990, he moved from Tennessee to Orlando, Florida to work in television. He helped launch WRBW, where he did everything from writing to producing to hosting shows. He was still doing stand-up comedy at this time performing at the Comedy Zone, Hilarities, and the Comedy Hous across the Southeastern part of the U.S.
In 1998, he moved to Nashville, TN and worked for a short stint with Earnhardt Productions, a local video and television production company. During this period, also known as "The Blue Period", he gave up doing stand-up comedy and just focused on producing, writing, and acting. Then was contacted by Monster.com to speak to high schools and colleges and for the next few years he toured the country doing just that. He took that experience and began speaking for corporations and doing corporate training for such companies as Fred Pryor Seminars and National Seminars. It was then Steed began rewriting his stand-up comedy act and taking his special brand of humor to the road. In 2008 he appeared at The Improv in Los Angeles, California.
In 2011 Steed was nominated for Inspirational Country Music Awards Comedian of the year. His screenplay, Spike Driver Blues, won Best Screenplay the New Hampshire Film Festival in late 2010.

<doc id="20891199" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20891199" title="Phi Omega Pi">
Phi Omega Pi

Phi Omega Pi (ΦΩΠ) was a national collegiate sorority operating in the United States from 1922 until 1946 when it was absorbed by the larger national sorority, Delta Zeta.
History.
The sorority originally formed as Achoth (a Hebrew word signifying one's blood sister or a female relative), created on the campus of the University of Nebraska on March 15, 1910. The fifteen founding sisters were all members in good standing of the Order of the Eastern Star. In a letter to the fraternity, Jessie Downing explained to Sigma Phi Epsilon that Achoth "is similar to that of the Acacia Fraternity, but in no way are the two connected". In 1911, it was officially recognized by the Order of the Eastern Star organization and only Earstern Star members were permitted to join. Chapters were named in Hebrew alphabetic order, The first chapter was "Aleph" (Nebraska), the second "Beth" (Iowa), etc.
Published materials from various fraternal organization demonstrate that Achoth was functioning as a typical collegiate sorority. The Trident of Delta Delta Delta (1920) recorded Achoth's petition for admission to the National Panhellenic Congress, but was denied (The Adelphean, 1921).
Achoth may have changed their official name as early as 1922. Kappa Sigma's Caduceus (1922) reported that the "Supreme Governing Council of Achoth announces the change of name 'Achoth' to 'Phi Omega Pi' fraternity." Other contemporary publications refer to Achoth as Achoth, e.g. "A chapter of Achoth, the organization of Eastern Star members, was installed last March" (IU Alumni Quarterly, 1922). The chapters were renamed according to the Greek alphabet and the sorority's periodical was renamed "Kochev" to "The Pentagon" (Miner, p. 146).
In 1933, Phi Omega Pi dropped the Masonic requirement and was thus given full membership into the National Panhellenic Conference. 
That same year, the sorority absorbed two other organizations. Sigma Phi Beta was a national group with ten chapters. It was founded on November 1, 1920 at New York University, as Sigma Sigma Omicron. In July 1927, the name was changed to Sigma Phi Beta (Miner, p. 148). 
Phi Alpha Chi, from the University of California at Berkeley, was founded as "The Tewanah" in 1919. In 1926, the group chartered as the Alpha chapter of Phi Alpha Chi. Then, they joined Sigma Phi Beta (Miner, p. 148). 
Miner (p. 146) explained that "after 1933, Achoth, Tanewah, Phi Alpha Chi, and Sigma Phi Beta members were all sisters in Phi Omega Pi. In the 1937 "Pentagon", sixteen collegiate and 39 alumnae chapters and clubs were listed."
In 1946, the members of ΦΩΠ were accepted into Delta Zeta sorority.
Crest.
As described by Miner,
"It had a sapphire blue ground crossed by an inverted chevron of white upon which were placed five five pointed stars. Below the chevron and to the left was placed the sword and veil and to the right the lily of the valley with five bells. Above the chevron was the Roman numeral X. Surmounting the shield a crown below which was a rod. Beneath the shield a white ribbon upon which are the Greek letters ΦΩΠ."
Pins.
The mebership badge was "an irregular pentagon. The center was raised and in black enamel. The upper section was surmounted by a raised five pointed star set with a blue sapphire. Around the edge of the bade were set 20 whole pearls." (Miner, p. 146)
The pledge pin was " a black enameled pentagon bearing the Greek letters ΦΩΠ in gold. The pentagon was banded in gold also." (Miner, p. 146)

Linda Lappin

Linda Lappin is a poet, novelist, and translator born in Tennessee in 1953. She received a MFA from the University of Iowa Writers Workshop in 1978. During her years at Iowa, she specialized in poetry with Florida poet Donald Justice. Her first volume of poetry, "Wintering with the Abominable Snowman", was published in 1976 by the avant-garde press, 'kayak,' run by George Hitchcock in Santa Cruz, California in 1976. 
She received a Fulbright grant in 1978 to participate in a two-year Fulbright seminar in literary translation held in Rome at the Centro Studi Americani, under the directorship of Frank MacShane of Columbia University and William Weaver, the noted translator from Italian. The project pursued by Lappin in those years, a translation from the Italian of Carmelo Samonà's novel, "Brothers", won two prizes in literary translation in the United States: The Renato Poggioli Award in Translation from Italian given by the New York PEN club and a National Endowment for the Arts grant in translation in 1987. She was awarded a second translation grant from the NEA in 1996 for her work on Tuscan writer Federigo Tozzi. From 1987 to the year 2000, she published essays, poems, reviews, and short stories in many US and European publications, including several essays on women writers and artists of the 1920s, including "Missing Person in Montparnasse", in the Literary Review, about the life of Jeanne Hébuterne, “Jane Heap and her Circle” in Prairie Schooner, dealing with the lives of Jane Heap and Margaret Anderson, founders of the Little Review and “Dada Queen in the Bad Boys’ Club, Baroness Elsa Von Freitag Loringhoven” in Southwest Review.
Major themes in Lappin’s work include women’s biographies and autobiographies, expatriate writers in the 1920s, and displacement.
Novels.
In "The Etruscan", her first novel, Harriet Sackett, a feminist photographer, travels to Italy to photograph Etruscan tombs for the Theosophical Society. Here she falls in love with a charismatic count, the occultist and amateur archaeologist, Federigo del Re, who materializes and disappears into the Etruscan landscape. As Harriet stalks her phantasm-lover, the solution to the mystery which propels the novel retreats. Is Federigo Del Re faithful; is he a real count, or even a real man; a fantasy or an Etruscan ghost? The novel draws inspiration from the literary gothic novel, Jungian archetypes, fairy tales, and from DH Lawrence’s "Sketches of Etruscan Places". Critically, "The Etruscan" has been analyzed as a recapitulation of the entire tradition of English/American fiction set in Italy. A documentary about the book entitled "A Tale of Tuscia", directed by Sergio Baldassarre, is available.
Lappin’s second novel, "Katherine's Wish", is a meta-fictional re-elaboration of textual documentation pertaining to the final phase of Katherine Mansfield’s life. Written from three points of view, that of Katherine Mansfield, of her companion, Ida Baker, and of her husband, John Middleton Murry, Katherine’s Wish recreates a slice of Mansfield’s life from 1918 until her retreat to Fontainebleau, to Gurdjieff’s Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in 1922, where she died in 1923. The novel focuses on Mansfield’s triangular relationship with Ida Baker and Middleton Murry while tracing her artistic and spiritual quest.
Lappin's third novel "Signatures in Stone" Caravel Books 2013 is set in the Monster Park of Bomarzo, and draws inspiration from the early twentieth century British writer, Mary Butts.

Bidzina Ivanishvili

Bidzina Ivanishvili (, also known as Boris Ivanishvili; born 18 February 1956) is a Georgian businessman and politician who was Prime Minister of Georgia from 25 October 2012 to 20 November 2013. He founded and led the Georgian Dream coalition, which won the 2012 parliamentary election. After the 2013 presidential election, he voluntarily resigned both his government and party positions, naming his long-time associate Irakli Gharibashvili as his successor.
In March 2010, Ivanishvili was granted French citizenship. In October 2011, he was deprived of his Georgian citizenship "according to Article 32 of the Georgian Law on Citizenship", shortly after he had announced his intention to form a political party to challenge Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. 
In March 2012, Ivanishvili was ranked at number 153 in "Forbes" magazine's annual list of the world's billionaires with an estimated worth of $6.4 billion, making him Georgia's richest person.
Early life.
Bidzina Ivanishvili was born the youngest of five children to a poor family in the Georgian village of Chorvila. His father worked in a manganese factory. He graduated high school in Sachkhere and went to Tbilisi State University to study engineering and economics. In 1982, he went to Moscow to pursue a Ph.D in economics at the Moscow State University of Railway Engineering.
Business interests.
Prior to 1990 while living in Moscow, Ivanishvili met Vitaly Malkin, a Russian businessman currently into politics, with whom he formed a partnership selling computers, and later importing what was then a novelty in Russia, push-button telephones. The source of his great wealth is metals and banking. Forbes magazine's description of the secret of his success could apply to dozens of other oligarchs in Russia: "He bought firms not needed by anybody for tens of millions of dollars and sold them for billions of dollars." In 1990 he and Malkin set up "Rossiysky Kredit", which is up to now Ivanishvili's biggest holding. Over the years, he sold other businesses accumulated by him during the privatization era in Russia, investing the proceeds in the Russian stock market. He has also interests in hotels, including Hotel Lux, and in a Russian chain of drugstores called "Doctor Stoletov". He is also redeveloping a former factory in downtown Moscow into a deluxe housing project, the first blocks of which are to be completed by 2012. 
In March 2010, he ranked 173 in 2010 Forbes List of Billionaires, with a reported net worth of 4.8 billion USD. The following year he ranked 185 in the 2011 Forbes List with a reported net worth of 5.5 billion USD. In March 2012, he ranked 153 in the 2012 Forbes List with a reported net worth of 6.4 billion USD; with his total net worth equaling one third of Georgia's Gross Domestic Product.
Political career.
In April 2012, he established the Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party with the intention to challenge the ruling United National Movement in the parliamentary election scheduled for October 2012. The Georgian Dream coalition is composed of the Republican Party of Georgia, Our Georgia – Free Democrats, the National Forum, the Conservative Party of Georgia and the Industry Will Save Georgia party. The head of the latter party publicly acknowledged in April 2012 that he doesn't share all of Ivanishvili's views on foreign policy, especially when it comes to joining NATO.
On 11 June 2012, a USD 90.9 million fine was imposed on Ivanishvili for alleged violation of the Georgian legislation on party funding. Ivanishvili is also under investigation on charges of using his companies Burji, Elita Burji, and Global Consulting Group for political and electoral goals.
In the Offshore leaks revelations of ICIJ about global offshore networks Premier Ivanishvili is mentioned among the most prominent figures. The documents show, that he has been director of the front company Bosherston Overseas Corporation in the British Virgin Islands (2006), a front company which still exists. The premier did not deny this and his spokesman commented: "For the reporting period of 2011-2012 Prime Minister Ivanishvili had no interest in the company you have mentioned in your inquiry and therefore there was no obligation to report it in his declaration. The Prime Minister takes these reporting requirements seriously and everything is done according to the law”.
Personal life.
Bidzina Ivanishvili lives in a house in the hills of Tbilisi which was specially designed for him by the famous Russian architect Mikhail Khazanov and finished by well known Japanese interior architect Shin Takamatsu which is worth an estimated $50 million.
Ivanishvili is also known by the Russian first name "Boris", which he previously used while working in Russia. He was widely reported under that name in the West. However, he has returned to his Georgian first name "Bidzina" in 2011.
Recently Ivanishvili became the subject of some interest in the art world, following his reported purchases of works by Pablo Picasso and the contemporary artist Peter Doig at auctions for prices well above their estimates.
Ivanishvili's son Bera is a well-known rapper in Georgia. "Georgian Dream" is a rap song by Bera and became an inspiration to his father who named the party he founded in 2012 Georgian Dream (full name Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia) after his son's rap song.

Hans Kirschstein

Hans Kirschstein (5 August 1896 - 16 July 1918), winner of the Pour le Merite, Royal House Order of Hohenzollern, and the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class, was a German lieutenant and World War I fighter ace credited with 27 aerial victories.
Early life.
Hans Kirschstein was born 5 August 1896 in Koblenz, in the Prussian kingdom of Germany. His father headed the provincial government. Hans joined the army as a combat engineer in the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in 1914. He served in France and Galicia; in the latter assignment, he contracted malaria in 1915. He was invalided home to recuperate, returning to duty in December 1915.
Aerial service as bomber pilot.
In February 1916, he applied for transfer to aviation duty. His transfer was granted and he took pilot's training at Schliessheim in May 1916. Upon graduation, he flew bombing raids for FA 19. Some of these raids were among the earliest examples of air attacks upon tanks. He won an Iron Cross Second Class for his service. In 1917, he continued his service as a two seater pilot, moving on to FA 256, and from there to FA 3.
Duty as fighter pilot.
See also Aerial victory standards of World War I
He applied for transfer to fighter duty in early 1918. He received fighter training and was assigned to a Prussian squadron, Jagdstaffel 6 on 13 March 1918. He would become this squadron's leading ace.
He scored his first victory on 18 March, flying a Fokker Dr.I in one of the great aerial battles of the war, in which the entirety of Manfred von Richthofen's fighter wing was committed to battle en masse. Kirschstein began by shooting down a Sopwith Camel. He scored twice more in March, on the 27th. He continued to score regularly; on 15 May, he shot down a Sopwith Camel and two Bristol F.2bs for his ninth, tenth, and eleventh triumphs. By the end of May, he was a triple ace, with 15 victories.
In early June, Jasta 6 upgraded from Fokker Dr.Is to Fokker D.VIIs. Kirschstein would fly two of the new airplanes, both entirely painted with black and white stripes as an optical illusion to confuse enemy aim. His Fokker Dr.I was handed on to Ernst Udet, who would be Germany's highest scoring ace to survive the war. He would fly them to 12 more victories in June, with his final win being his 27th on 24 June 1918. He would also ascend to command of the Jasta on 10 June. He was awarded the Pour le Merite, Germany's highest award for valor in battle, on 24 June 1918.
Death by flying accident.
On 16 July, Kirschstein flew one of his planes in for maintenance at the repair depot at Fismes. He was accompanied by a new pilot in his Jasta, Leutnant Johannes Markgraf, flying formation in a two seater Hannover CL. After leaving the Fokker, Kirschstein climbed into the rear seat of the Hannover for the return trip. Markgraf, who was unfamiliar with the Hannover, stalled it out at about 50 meters altitude on takeoff. The crash killed both men.

Elizabeth Gregg Patterson

Elizabeth Gregg Patterson was born in Newport, Arkansas on August 8, 1904, and lived there until attending Smith College where she graduated in 1926.
She moved to New York City and soon after, her career as a writer of short fiction began. For two decades, her stories appeared in such magazines as "Charm", "Collier's", "Cosmopolitan", "The New Yorker", "Atlantic Monthly", "Saturday Evening Post" and many more. Throughout her career, she was represented by Harold Ober Associates of New York City.
In 1942, Patterson became a Fellow, at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, Middlebury College, and later, her short story, "Homecoming", was awarded third prize in the 1951 O. Henry Award for short fiction.
She married Kenneth C. Patterson in 1930, and moved to Saginaw, Michigan, where she did much of her published writing. Elizabeth was devoted to Newport and had many relatives in that area. She returned there often. As the market for short fiction began to wane, she retired from writing in the late 1950s and divided her time and interests between world travel and living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
In 1983, Patterson suffered a debilitating stroke and soon after, her son, J. David Patterson, relocated Elizabeth to Key West, Florida, where he and his wife owned a sportfishing charter business. She died on March 15, 1987, in Key West, and was buried in the Gregg family plot in Newport. Following her death, The Newport Billingsley Memorial Library set aside a section dedicated to the display of a collection of her work, including many original magazines and telegrams from her agent, Dorothy Olding and Harold Ober, informing her of the sale of a story.
Included among her literary friends were Wallace Stegner, Theodore Roethke, Norman Cousins.

In astronomy, the local standard of rest or LSR follows the mean motion of material in the Milky Way in the neighborhood of the Sun. The path of this material is not precisely circular. The Sun follows the solar circle (eccentricity "e" < 0.1 ) at a speed of about 220 km/s in a clockwise direction when viewed from the galactic north pole at a radius of ≈ 8 kpc about the center of the galaxy near Sgr A*, and has only a slight motion, towards the Solar apex, relative to the LSR.

Albert L. Hopkins

__NOTOC__
Albert L. Hopkins worked at the US MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (now known as the Draper Lab) during the development of the Apollo Guidance, Navigation, and Control System, or the GN&C. The system was designed in two forms, one for the command module and one for the lunar module. The CM version included an optical system with an integrated scanning telescope and sextant for erecting and correcting the inertial platform. Albert Hopkins (Assistant Director with MIT lab) together with Ramon Alonso, and Hugh Blair-Smith was a member of the group that designed the computer, designated AGC for Apollo Guidance Computer, identical in the CM and LM.
The AGC was a 15-bit plus parity machine with a 1 MHz clock. It was about one cubic foot in volume and weighed about 80 pounds. It used integrated circuit NOR gates, two to a package, but integrated RAM and ROM devices had not been developed yet. It had 2,000 words of magnetic ferrite core read-write memory and maybe 24 thousand words of read-only memory in the form of magnetic core ropes. These cores used metal tape magnetic cores. With such limited computing resources, the software had to be extremely tightly written in assembly code. These computers were designed with extremely long mean times to failure. Some 50 were built by Raytheon, and none ever had a failure over several years of life. The human interface was a keyboard with ten digit keys and a few auxiliary keys for such things as "+" and "–" and "enter", and a display with three numbers of 5 decimal/octal digits, a two-digit program number, and a two-digit verb and a two-digit noun. The astronauts used it for all phases of command.
After leaving Draper Labs, Albert Hopkins, with his wife Lynne Zaccaria, opened a pottery and antiques shop in South Danbury, New Hampshire. They now live in Florida.

Stuguflåt Bridge ( or ) is a stone railway bridge north of Stuguflåten on the Rauma Line over the river Rauma in Oppland. The bridge is long, has a span and is wide.
Work began on the bridge in 1919 and the foundations were laid in autumn 1920, with the walls started by summer 1921. The first rails were laid on 16 September 1921 and were finished on 22 August 1922. The first train crossed in autumn 1922 and materials from this cargo were used to make a permanent snowplough. Stuguflåt Bridge was used year round since 1923 and the total cost of the bridge was NOK 407,997.
In January 1945, Joachim Rønneberg and SOE agents (Operation Fieldfare) tried to damage the bridge in order to halt the movement by German occupant forces on Rauma Line. The bridge was reopened three weeks later.

Clifton baronets

Two unrelated baronetcies have been created in the surname of Clifton.
The Clifton Baronetcy, of Clifton in the County of Nottinghamshire, was created in the Baronetage of England on 22 May 1611 for Sir Gervas Clifton, of Clifton Hall, Nottingham. This Clifton family took their name from the settlement on the Bank of the River Trent at Clifton, Nottinghamshire, which they made their home at the time of the Norman Conquest. The family was much involved in the events of its times. Several members of the family served from the 13th century as High Sheriff of the counties of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Sir John Clifton was slain fighting for the King at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1402. Sir Gervase Clifton was captured and beheaded following the Battle of Tewkesbury during the Wars of the Roses in 1471.
The first Baronet was the grandson of Sir Gervase Clifton (High Sheriff of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire in 1547 and of Nottinghamshire only in 1571) whom he succeeded at the age of only four months in 1588. He was created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of James I in 1603 and was elevated to baronet in 1611. He served as High Sheriff for Nottinghamshire in 1610 and Deputy Lieutenant 1626-42 and 1660-1666. He was Member of Parliament for Nottinghamshire 1614-1625, 1628-29 and 1661-66, for Nottingham in 1626 and for East Retford 1640-46. He married seven times and was succeeded by the sons and grandsons of three of those wives.
The Baronetcy was extinct on the death of the 9th Baronet. The Nottinghamshire estate remained in the family ownership until 1958.
Gervase Clifton, 1st Baron Clifton was a descendant of the Nottinghamshire family.
The Clifton Baronetcy, of Clifton in the County of Lancaster, was created on 4 March 1661 for Thomas Clifton of Clifton Hall, near Lytham, Lancashire who was descended from Gilbert de Clifton, High Sheriff of Lancashire on four occasions in the 13th century. The Baronetcy became extinct on his death in 1694.

<doc id="20891575" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20891575" title="Marble Mountain Wilderness">
Marble Mountain Wilderness

The Marble Mountain Wilderness is a wilderness area located northeast of Eureka, California, USA. It is managed by the US Forest Service and is within the Klamath National Forest. The land was first set aside on April 1931 as the Marble Mountain Primitive Area (), it was one of four areas to gain primitive status under the Forest Service's L-20 regulations that year. In 1964, it became a federally designated wilderness area when the US Congress passed the Wilderness Act.
The name comes from the distinctive coloration caused by light-colored limestone along with black metamorphic rock on some peaks, giving the mountains a marbled appearance. There are at least five different rock types identified here.
The wilderness is in the Klamath Mountains geomorphic province (a large area having similar features such as terrain and geology). The horseshoe-shaped Salmon Mountains are at the core of the wilderness with Marble Mountain being a north-trending spur ridge of the Salmons.
Flora and fauna.
This area of high divides, deep canyons and perennial mountain streams provides habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal life. With more than 7,000 feet of vertical relief, soils from several rock types, and abundant rain and snowfall, the diversity of ecosystems is unequaled anywhere else in the country.
The wilderness contains a number of isolated stands of locally rare conifers. For example, the subalpine fir grows along the granite moraines at the head of watersheds above in open areas surrounding lakes and meadows, in the Sky High Lakes Basin, in Shelly Meadow along the Pacific Crest Trail and in the Deep Lake area. All of the subalpine fir groves in northwest California are more than from the next closest subalpine fir stand, which is in southern Oregon on Mount Ashland. In addition, the headwaters of the Salmon River in the wilderness also hold a relict stand of Pacific silver fir, which is the southern most stand in the range of the species.
Common wildlife include the black-tailed deer and black bear. Less commonly seen species are badger and wolverine. Bird species include the great grey owl and northern goshawk. Also the peregrine falcon and bald eagle, both of which have been removed (August 2007 and August 1999, respectively) from the federal threatened/endangered species list.
Fish species include summer steelhead and a spring run of king salmon in Wooley Creek, as well as resident rainbow trout in other streams in the wilderness.
There are several rare wildflowers that are adapted to serpentine soils of the Marble Mountain Wilderness and surrounding area. These include crested cinquefoil or crested potentilla ("Potentilla cristae"), Siskiyou fireweed ("Epilobium siskiyouense"), and McDonald's rock cress ("Arabis blepharophylla" var. "macdonaldiana"), a perennial found in conifer forests of California and Oregon. MacDonald's rockcress is both state-listed (1979) and federally listed (1978) as endangered.
Recreation.
With 89 lakes and two major Wild and Scenic river systems-Wooley Creek and the North Fork Salmon River, as well as of the Pacific Crest Trail, there are many recreation opportunities. Elevations range from to giving a highly variable terrain with low-elevation canyons and high ridges such as the -long English Peak ridge.
Popular activities include fishing, backpacking and cross-country skiing.
There are several national forest campgrounds outside the boundary and one camp inside the wilderness near Wooley Creek, named after Anthony Milne, who was a miner in the area around 1885.

<doc id="20891617" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20891617" title="Acid Rain Retirement Fund">
Acid Rain Retirement Fund

The Acid Rain Retirement Fund (A.R.R.F) is an all-volunteer, non-profit environmental educational organization dedicated to reducing pollution by purchasing and “retiring” marketable sulfur dioxide emissions allowances issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Acid Rain Program. A.R.R.F. was created in 1995 and purchased its first allowances in that year. A.R.R.F. provides citizens with information about access to pollution markets, along with the ability to directly prevent pollution. 
A.R.R.F is one of only four organizations listed on the home page of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Markets as purchasing allowances to take them off the market. None of the major national environmental groups are listed there. A.R.R.F. is incorporated in the State of Maine as a nonprofit educational organization.
Marketable emissions allowances.
Pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1990, each year in March the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency auctions off to the highest bidder about 250,000 pollution allowances that enable companies to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide. Those companies face statutory penalties of $2,000/ton for every ton of sulfur dioxide they emit in excess of those for which they own allowances. Emissions allowances are bought and sold daily through the Chicago Board of Trade like soybeans, rice or any other commodity. Only a limited number of allowances are available each year. After those allowances are used, no more can be issued. The Acid Rain Retirement Fund raises money and bids alongside polluters in the annual auctions for as many allowances as their funds can buy. But instead of using or trading them, A.R.R.F. retires them permanently, taking allowances off the market and keeping sulfur dioxide out of the air. Thus, every pollution allowance A.R.R.F. removes from circulation prevents that pollution from being legally emitted into the air. 
A teaching moment.
Sulfur dioxide is the principal contributor to acid rain, causing respiratory disorders, impairing visibility, harming the health of fish and wildlife, and degrading lakes and ponds. Research has shown lakes and streams in New England have been slow to recover from the effect of acid rain, compared to some in Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania. Acid rain brings with it mercury deposition, and together they cause tremendous damage to human health and the environment. Research by the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation recently identified nine suspected mercury hotspots in the northeastern U.S. and Canada. Harvard University economist Robert Stavins estimates about $1 billion per year has been saved in the United States by cleaning up since the Acid Rain Program went into effect.
Educational programs.
The Acid Rain Retirement Fund uses participation in pollution markets as a way to educate children and adults about the sources and detrimental effects of air pollution and acid rain, and actions people can take to reduce such pollution. Presentations are made in school classrooms about the causes and effects of acid rain, and students are encouraged to design their own fundraising efforts. The A.R.R.F. website contains links about acid rain and suggestions for educational activities and fundraising efforts.
Accomplishments to date.
A.R.R.F. has participated in annual EPA auctions of emissions allowances every year since 1995, and in 2013 owns the right to emit 1,413 tons of sulfur dioxide per year, plus whatever amount it has not emitted in previous years. Because A.R.R.F. did not exercise its right to emit any pollution during 1996-2013, “banking” its emissions allowances for the future, A.R.R.F. in 2013 holds the legal right to emit a total of 2,322 tons (4,644,000 pounds) of sulfur dioxide in 2013. That amount will increase by another 100 tons in 2018, when allowances A.R.R.F. purchased in the 7-year advance auction of 2011 are eligible for use. 
According to A.R.R.F., EPA auction results 1993-2013 indicate groups or individuals who purchased emissions allowances for purposes other than releasing air pollution own the right to emit 3,188 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. Although most have purchased only one or a few tons, this adds up to considerably more than the 760 tons/year allocated by law to the Miami Fort #5 generating unit in Ohio. 
Since many purchases were made in earlier years, and unused allowances have accumulated, these groups now own the right to emit 23,012 tons of sulfur dioxide in 2013. That’s more than the annual allocation of allowances to 168 of the 250 dirtiest generating units in the United States (some are allowed to emit almost 95,000 tons/year).
Fund raising.
Fund raising projects organized by A.R.R.F. with other groups in fifteen states include a paper recycling drive by eighth graders; sale of blue paper cut-out raindrops at 50 cents each to friends and family by middle-schoolers (who put them on classroom walls with names of purchasers on them); benefit concerts; bake sales, and direct funding requests to businesses and individuals. Funds have been donated by individuals and groups from all over the United States, including sixth-grade students at South Kortright Central School in South Kortright, NY; Queensbury Middle School in Queensbury, NY; Lynx House, Conserve School, Land O’ Lakes, WI; Students for Environmental Action, East Lansing High School, East Lansing, MI; Jesuit High School 6th Graders, New Orleans, LA; Humboldt State University Natural Resources Club, Humboldt, CA; and the Environmental Law Council at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Donations have also been received from groups in Sweden and Japan.
Clean air certificates.
Since 1995, A.R.R.F. has recognized donations of $25 or more by sending a Clean Air Certificate on parchment-like paper to the donor or a person or group they designate, saying how many pounds of air pollution will be retired in their name. Numerous school classrooms display these certificates.

Quebec general election, 2012

The Quebec general election of 2012 took place in the Canadian province of Quebec on September 4, 2012. Lieutenant Governor Pierre Duchesne dissolved the National Assembly on August 1, 2012, following Premier Jean Charest's request. The Parti Québécois were elected to a minority government, with Pauline Marois becoming the first woman to be Premier of Quebec. The Quebec Liberal Party took second place, with Premier Jean Charest losing his seat. The newly formed party Coalition Avenir Québec led by François Legault took third place, while Québec solidaire took 2 seats out of the 125.
It is the first time since 2007 (and only the third time in Quebec history) that a minority government will be formed because no party won an absolute majority of the seats. Both the PQ and Liberal vote declined which boosted support for the CAQ and Quebec Solidaire.
During Marois' victory speech, an attack including gunshots and a fire occurred at the Métropolis concert hall housing the event and a forty-year-old man died as a result of gunshot wounds.

John Texter

John Texter (born August 9, 1949, Lancaster, Pennsylvania) is an American engineer, chemist, and educator, and is professor of polymer and coating technology at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He is best known for his work in applied dispersion technology and small particle science, for his international conference organization activities, including Particles 2001, Particles 2002, etc., and the Gordon Research Conferences, Chemistry at Interfaces and Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies, and for his editing of the Primers page for nanoparticles.org.
Education.
Texter received his secondary education at Penn Manor High School in Millersville, PA, where he lettered in soccer and wrestling. He matriculated to Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, in 1967 with the aid of a Lehigh Merit Scholarship and graduated with a BSEE in 1971. He was mentored in his undergraduate years by John J. Karakash, who designed the Electrical Engineering curriculum at Lehigh to liberally educate through engineering. His proclivity for control theory sparked an interest in physiology and then biochemistry, and his undergraduate biochemistry studies led him to physical chemistry. He continued at Lehigh to obtain an MS in chemistry in 1973, an MS in mathermatics in 1976, and a Ph.D in chemistry in 1976. He was mentored in graduate education by Jim Sturm, Daniel Zeroka, Albert Zettlemoyer, Fred Fowkes, and Kamil Klier, his thesis advisor. Texter spent a postdoctoral year in biophysical spectroscopy at the University of California at Irvine and a postdoctoral year with Eugene S. Stevens at SUNY Binghamton, developing a time-dependent Hartree-Fock model for circular dichroism in saccharides.
Industrial career.
Texter has over 30 years experience in industrial small particle and coating technologies. He worked in the Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories from 1978 to 1998 and he was managing consultant for Strider Research Corporation from 1998 to 2002. From the spring of 2001 he served for a year as a rotator in the National Science Foundation Chemistry Division as Program Director of Experimental Physical Chemistry.
While at Eastman Kodak he was a prolific inventor and co-inventor in the field of dispersion technology, and he received 42 issued US Patents and numerous EU and PTO patents.
Academic career.
Texter joined the College of Technology of Eastern Michigan University in the fall of 2002 as professor of polymer and coating technology at the rank of full professor. In 2005 he was awarded tenure. Since joining EMU he also has been a faculty member of the Coatings Research Institute. He recently spent a sabbatical year near Berlin as a Fellow of the Max Planck Society with Professor Markus Antionetti at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces.
His research has focused on small particle science and technology, the development of particle-based advanced materials, and polymeric advanced materias. His work has focused on applied problems in dispersion and materials technology for advanced coatings in imaging, antifouling, corrosion mitigation, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. He has made significant contributions to the understanding of microemulsion structure and the complex equilibria that exist among the exotic molecular complexes contained in microemulsions, as well as in microemulsion polymerization. Seminal self-diffusion studies done with collaborators at Eastman Kodak produced order parameters that proved transitions among such complex equilibiria are continuous phase transitions (chemical equilibria). More recently he has demonstrated thermally initiated microemulsion polymerization in bicontinuous microemulsions, wherein the expansion of the correlation length was only 20% relative to the precursor microemulsion, surpassing competitive attempts by two orders of magnitude.
In more recent years he has become a leading innovator in the fields of stimuli responsive polymers and polymerized ionic liquids. Microemulsion polymerization of ionic liquid surfactant acrylates was used to produce transparent gels that reversibly undergo spinodal decomposition to open cell membranes and monoliths. Related nanolatexes have been formulated that appear to be the first experimental realizations of osmotic spheres.
Awards and honors.
Dr. Texter has received numerous awards and honors including the 2007 Ronald W. Collins Distinguished Faculty Research Award, a Service Recognition Award from the ACS Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry, a Team Achievement Award for Improved Ferrotyping, induction into the Kodak Distinguished Inventors’ Gallery, an MRE Innovation Award for Nanocrystalline Technology, the CTO Patent Award for Innovation and Initiative in Patenting, listings in American Men and Women of Science, Who’s Who in Science and Engineering, Who's Who in America, and various fellowships.
Service to the Public and the Profession.
Texter served as Chairman of the Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 1998 and in a variety of line officer and executive committee positions before and since (1991–2002), and returned to serve as Program Chair (2008–2010). He has organized many national and international conferences, including chairing the Gordon Research Conferences Chemistry of Interfaces (Interfacial Structurein Meriden, NH, in 1996 and Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies (Functional Materials through Bottom-Up Self-Assembly[4) in Barga, Tuscany in 2007. He has also organized and served as General Chair for the Particles Conferences Particles 2001, Particles 2002, through Particles 2013 in Dayton. He is a member of the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Physical Society, the Materials Research Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and the Society for Imaging Science and Technology.
Personal life.
Texter and his wife Melanie Ann Martin have a son Kurt M. Texter, and a daughter Grace M. Texter. Kurt studied graphic design at the Academy of Art University of San Francisco and graduated in May 2013 with A BFA in Graphic Design. Kurt founded Texter Design and is employed as a visual designer with Great Fridays of San Francisco, London, and Manchester. Grace is studying English and art at Pace University in lower Manhattan.

A Life of Her Own

A Life of Her Own is a 1950 American melodrama film directed by George Cukor. The screenplay by Isobel Lennart focuses on an aspiring model who leaves her small town in the Midwest to seek fame and fortune in New York City. The film was produced by Voldemar Vetluguin and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
Plot.
Lily Brannel James leaves her small home town in Kansas for New York City, where she gets herself hired by the Thomas Caraway Model Agency. She befriends former top model Mary Ashlon, who becomes her mentor. Mary is depressed about her foundering career and, following a night of excessive drinking, she commits suicide.
Lily eventually becomes a very successful model. As a favor to her attorney friend Jim Leversoe, she spends some time with Steve Harleigh, a Montana copper-mine owner in New York on business. The two fall in love, but both realize nothing can come of it. After Steve goes home, he has Jim buy Lily a bracelet, but she refuses to accept it.
Lily finds that success does not fill the void in her life. When Steve returns to New York to secure a loan, he runs into her. He tells her he is married. His wife Nora was left a paraplegic in an automobile accident for which he was responsible. Despite this, their feelings for each other are too strong, and they embark on an affair. 
Matters come to a head when Nora visits him to celebrate his birthday. On the night of Steve's birthday, Lily hosts a party too, even though Steve stays with Nora, who is making some progress in relearning to walk with crutches. Steve slips out to Lily's party and is taken aback by her self-destructive behavior. 
Lily decides to confront Nora and asks family friend Jim to accompany her. However, when she sees how nice Nora is and how dependent she is on her husband, Lily cannot bring herself to tell her about her involvement with Steve. On the way out, she bumps into Steve at the elevator and tells him it is over.
Some time later, Lily runs into advertising executive Lee Gorrance, who had been dating Mary just prior to her death. When Lily resists his romantic advances, he predicts she will end up lonely and depressed like Mary. Upset by his comments, Lily considers ending her own life, but finally resolves to remain strong, even if she is lonely.
Production.
Joseph Breen rejected the original script as unacceptable and termed it "shocking and highly offensive" for its portrayal of "adultery and commercialized prostitution." A revised version was found to have "insufficient compensating moral values." In order to bring the story into agreement with the Production Code, screenwriter Isobel Lennart was required to "show that the adulterous situation is wrong and that sinners must be punished for their sin."
Vincente Minnelli originally was assigned to direct the film, but numerous script revisions and problems with casting delayed the start of production by several months, and Minnelli began work on "Father of the Bride" instead. Lana Turner initially refused to star in the film, but MGM executives Louis B. Mayer and Dore Schary demanded she honor her contract with the studio. Howard Keel, Cary Grant, George Murphy, and James Mason were among those considered for the role of Steve Harleigh, which eventually went to Wendell Corey, who worked on the production through mid-February 1950 but then allegedly asked to be released from the film because he felt he wasn't right for the role. Other sources claimed he was dismissed at the request of Turner and director George Cukor following an argument between the two stars (supposedly Corey, after an inadvertent wardrobe delay by Turner, made a remark that Barbara Stanwyck, whose husband Robert Taylor was reportedly having an affair with Turner, wouldn't have kept everyone waiting; Turner then demanded a casting change). He was replaced by Ray Milland.
The film's original ending had Lily leaping to her death, but the studio insisted on a happier finale. Cukor disapproved of the studio's interference and was unhappy with the film as it was released.
Box Office.
According to MGM's records, the film earned $1,413,000 in the US and Canada and $504,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss to the studio of $679,000.
Critical reception.
"Variety" observed, "The soap opera plotting has been polished to considerable extent, the playing by the femme cast members is topnotch and the direction aids them, but it is still a true confession type of yarn concerned with a big city romance between a married man and a beautiful model. Script is spotted with feeling and character, and also a lot of conversation that doesn't mean much. A decided asset is Lana Turner's performance."
Music.
As revealed in the liner notes of the "Film Score Monthly" release of the music from the film, the main theme for this film would be reused by the composer in the 1952 MGM film "Invitation".
Awards and nominations.
Bronisław Kaper was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score but lost to Franz Waxman for "Sunset Boulevard".

Aliso Creek (Los Angeles County)

Aliso Creek (also Aliso Canyon Wash or Aliso Wash) is a major tributary of the Los Angeles River in Los Angeles County, California, with a watershed of . It is the second major tributary to enter the Los Angeles River downstream of the Bell Creek/Calabasas Creek merge. The stream runs about from Aliso Canyon below Oat Mountain to its confluence with the Los Angeles River. During its first mile, it is a free-flowing stream mostly contained within Aliso Canyon Park and Eddlestone Park. After it passes under State Route 118 (Ronald Reagan Freeway) it empties into a retention basin and from there on is encased in a concrete flood control channel, flowing due south. Upstream of Plummer St., it merges with the Wilbur Canyon Wash, and shortly downstream merges with Limekiln Wash, both on the right bank. West of the West Valley Park, Aliso Creek makes a 90-degree bend to the east and merges with the mainstem Los Angeles River.

Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege

Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege (14 May 1652 – 20 June 1693) was a German noblewoman. In her teens she was brought up at the Swedish royal court as the future queen of King Charles XI of Sweden, her cousin. However, on two separate occasions before the wedding Juliana became pregnant, and the engagement was eventually broken off. In 1679 or 1680, Juliana married a Dutchman and lived the rest of her life in the Netherlands, while Charles married Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark in 1680.
Juliana was born in Eschwege to Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Eschwege (son of Maurice of Hesse-Kassel and his second wife, Juliana of Nassau-Dillenburg), and Eleonora Catherine, a Swedish princess. Her maternal grandmother was Princess Catharina of Sweden, and her mother was a sister of King Charles X of Sweden. Juliana was likely named after her paternal grandmother, a daughter of John VII of Nassau, who was herself likely named after her paternal grandmother, Juliana of Stolberg.
Juliana's mother had caused a scandal in Sweden when she confessed to her husband that she had an affair with a French lute-player and actor, Beschon, and was expecting his child. Juliana's father tried to hide the matter but it became a known scandal. It is said that Eleonora was too embarrassed to return to the Swedish court, so she preferred to live in the palace in Eschwege, although she did visit Sweden.
Juliana was described as a great beauty. She was taken to the royal Swedish court to be brought up there as the future queen of Sweden by queen dowager Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, with the prospect of being married to her cousin, King Charles, when he reached adulthood.
These plans never came about. In 1672, during a "walk by carriage" in Stockholm with the queen dowager, Princess Juliana fell to the floor of the carriage in labour. The father of the child proved not to be her cousin the king, but a married officer of the court, Count Gustaf Lillie. The count was exiled, and Juliana was sent to the country, where she was given her own estate and court. The child, a son, was named after his father, Gustaf Gustafsson Lillie, was later raised by Baron Gustaf Adolf von der Osten. His fate is unknown.
A couple of years later, Juliana gave birth to another son. This time the father was Johann Jakob Marchand, the young, unmarried son of her Dutch housekeeper. Baptized on 29 November 1656 in Breda, Marchand was the secretary of the Dutch ambassador, and about four years younger than Juliana. In 1679, Juliana's cousin, King Charles, gave her his permission to marry her lover, who was given the title Baron von Lilienburg (Lilie's estate was named Lillienborg). They were married on 22 February 1680 in Raeftnas, Soedermanland and then settled in Haarlem, the Netherlands.
Juliana died in 1693 in IJsselstein. Her husband lived ten years more and died on 7 April 1703 in IJsselstein.
Her sister, Christine of Hesse-Eschwege, became the Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg as the wife of Ferdinand Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and was a great-great-great-grandmother of Victoria of the United Kingdom.
Children.
Juliana had the following children.

Commercial Information Exchange

A Commercial Information Exchange (CIE) is an Internet-based commercial property listing service that is operated by a local association to serve the local market. A CIE is the commercial real estate equivalent of the residential Multiple Listing Service. CIEs help commercial real estate professionals (brokers, property owners, developers, investors, tenants, etc.) share information about commercial property, recent sale or lease transactions, market statistics, and contacts. 
CIEs tend to exist in larger markets with a more developed, more organized commercial real estate industry. There are less than 100 CIEs in the United States. 
CIEs vary in scope, serving cities, states, or larger regions. They also vary in function, depending on the depth and breadth of data in a particular market. For example, the "Louisiana Commercial Database" contains primarily commercial for sale or lease in the state of Louisiana while the "Commercial Alliance of Las Vegas' CIE" includes active listings, off-market properties, and completed transactions in the greater Las Vegas area. 
Differences from Residential Multiple Listing Service.
There are two key differences between a Commercial Information Exchange and a Multiple Listing Service. CIE participants need not have an exclusive right to sell or lease a property in order to list it on a CIE, and CIE listings need not include details on compensation for cooperating parties.

The Van Rompuy Government was the federal government of Belgium from 30 December 2008 until 15 November 2009. Herman Van Rompuy was nominated as the first President of the European Council and resigned shortly after as Premier. It took office when the Flemish Christian Democrat Herman Van Rompuy (Christian Democratic and Flemish, CD&V) was sworn in as Prime Minister after the Leterme I Government fell on 22 December 2008.
On 18 December 2008, Yves Leterme offered his government's resignation to King Albert after a scandal erupted surrounding the investigation of the sale of the failing Fortis bank to BNP Paribas. Leterme, Jo Vandeurzen, and Didier Reynders were accused of violating the separation of powers by trying to influence the Court of Appeals and of exerting improper influence by the First Chairman of the Court of Cassation. Three days later the resignation was accepted by the king. 
To be official, the Van Rompuy I government needed a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Representatives. It received the vote of confidence on 2 January 2009.
The government was succeeded on 24 November 2009 by the Leterme II Government.

Ulrika Strömfelt

Ulrika Eleonora Strömfelt (1724 – 1780) was a politically active Swedish noble and lady-in-waiting who played an important part in the attempted Coup d'état of queen Louisa Ulrika. 
Daughter of nobleman and statesman Johan Strömfelt, she and her sister Agneta were made ladies-in-waiting to the crown princess, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia in 1746. She belonged to the first group to be made ladies-in-waiting to Louisa Ulrika upon her arrival in Sweden, together with Cathérine Charlotte De la Gardie, Henrika Juliana von Liewen and Lotta Sparre. In 1748, she replaced Liewen as first lady-in-waiting, a position she kept until 1756.
In 1756, Queen Louisa Ulrika planned a coup d'état to depose the parliament and restore absolute monarchy. To finance the coup, Louisa Ulrika removed the diamonds from the queens' crown, replacing them with crystals. Strömfelt, who was a supporter of the Hats (party), informed the government. The government then demanded that they be allowed to inspect the crown jewels. They confirmed Strömfelt's accusation, which resulted in the exposure and failure of the queen's coup.
In recognition of Strömfelt's acts, she was awarded the title of "The Daughter of the Parliament" and a pension of $2,000.
She married Over-Governor of Stockholm baron Carl Sparre in 1756 and was replaced as first lady-in-waiting by Ulrika Eleonora von Düben. She served as the head lady-in-waiting of the next queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, from 1777 to 1780.

Constantius (Theban Legion)

Saint Constantius () is venerated as a member of the legendary Theban Legion. Similar to the cults of Saint Chiaffredo at Crissolo, Saint Bessus at Val Soana, Saint Tegulus at Ivrea, Saint Magnus at Castelmagno, and Saint Dalmatius at Borgo San Dalmazzo, the cult of Saint Constantius was linked with that of the Theban Legion to lend antiquity to a local saint about whom nothing was really known. 
According to tradition, Constantius survived the decimation of his Legion and fled to the Val Maira, today in the province of Cuneo, with some other survivors. These included Constantine, Dalmatius, Desiderius, Isidore, Magnus, Olympius, Pontius, Theodore, and Victor. They dedicated themselves to preaching the Christian religion, but all of them, except for Constantius, were soon killed by the Roman authorities. Constantius buried his companions.
The local geologic formation known as "Ciciu del Villar", which are columns formed by natural erosion, was connected with Constantius' legend: the stones are said to be the Roman soldiers sent to kill him, who were miraculously petrified before they could harm the saint.
According to tradition, Constantius was eventually beheaded on Monte San Bernardo, where a sanctuary dedicated to him was built, known as San Costanzo al Monte. This sanctuary probably dates to Lombard times; some eighth century sculptures remain. The sanctuary was rebuilt and altered in succeeding centuries, and the stone church was completed in 1190. A Baroque façade was added later. The Benedictine abbatial church of Santi Vittore e Costanzo, also in Villar, conserves some important archaeological remains, including a marble slab bearing vermilion symbols and worn down by the hands of the faithful. 
Constantius’ cult became popular, with a pilgrimage to Villar by the faithful taking place every year.
Monsignor Tornabuoni, bishop of Saluzzo, declared Chiaffredo patron of his diocese during a synod of 1516, with Constantius as co-patron. Statues of Chiaffredo and Constantius can be found in the altar of the cathedral of Saluzzo. Due to his connection with the Theban Legion, Constantius is considered to have been of Egyptian birth; this has led to his veneration in the Coptic Church.

St. Fidgeta and Other Parodies

St. Fidgeta & Other Parodies, a mostly uncategorizable spoof of 1960s Catholicism, was the first published work by John Bellairs. The original St. Fidgeta article first appeared in the Chicago-based Catholic magazine, the "Critic." it describes the putative life of St. Fidgeta ("Quieter of the giggly / Steadier of the wiggly"), a seven-year-old martyr and the patroness of unmanageable children. A subsequent book appeared with eleven other vignettes that offered sardonic comment on the Vatican II era. Long out of print, "St. Fidgeta" was re-released in the 2009 anthology, "Magic Mirrors", published by the New England Science Fiction Association press.
Author's Note.
"I would like to thank my friends, Dale and Marilyn Fitschen, for all their help. They suffered through endless readings from the Urtext and gave me many suggestions and ideas. I would also like to thank my friend Bernard Kent Markwell, to whom St. Fidgeta first appeared on a rainy day in front of the Oriental Institute in Chicago. He was struck to the ground by the vision, and after he had rolled about for a bit, he got up and told me what he had seen. He also gave me many ideas: in fact, if you do not like some part of this book, you may attribute it to him."
St. Fidgeta.
St. Fidgeta is the patron saint of nervous and fidgety children. She was born in 482 AD. She was martyred by her teacher, the notorious pagan skeptic Putricordes, whom she outraged by her unremitting and unrelenting piety; he slapped her to death in 490 AD. St. Fidgeta saved the city of Pinsk from certain destruction by a Turkish army in 1450. Appearing as a fluffy pink cloud on the Pinsk walls, she "induced in the heathen army a state of uneasiness", forcing the soldiers of the Prophet to retreat.

Bradley Tusk

Bradley Tusk (Born October 3, 1973) served as the campaign manager for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s successful 2009 re-election bid. The Bloomberg campaign was described by the New York Times as a "juggernaut." The New York City Mayor's race was considered to be among the nation's highest profile elections in 2009.
In referring to Tusk's role with the Bloomberg campaign, the New York Times said: "Mr. Tusk’s high level of organization, and his demand for corporate-style accountability, earned him admiration and occasional resentment within the campaign. He kept meticulous checklists and spreadsheets on a dozen topics at a time, and sought daily, sometimes hourly, updates from staff members. Over the summer, he ordered staff members to work until 8 every night. They were unhappy, and let him know it. He refused to back down, worried the large staff was becoming complacent. Yet the campaign rarely, if ever, missed an internal deadline, and it committed few serious missteps." The New York Observer described Tusk as "Mayor Bloomberg's Secret Weapon." Tusk was recently named one of the “Top 20 most influential people in New York City".
Tusk is the founder of Tusk Strategies, a political and strategic consulting firm based in New York City. Their clients range from major corporations like Walmart & AT&T to major issue advocacy campaigns around education reform and good government, to campaigns to help political candidates, non-profits and trade associations. Tusk ran the successful campaign to raise the cap on the number of charter schools allowed in New York State, giving 125,000 more students across the state a chance to attend charter schools and putting New York in position to win Race to the Top. The campaign was widely hailed as a triumph over the special interests that usually dominate the legislative agenda in Albany. The campaign was called a "coup for the charter school movement" by the Wall Street Journal, a "huge win for the kids" by the New York Daily News, and a "significant victory" by the New York Times.
Prior to serving as campaign manager for Bloomberg 2009, Tusk, who previously had not been a resident of Illinois, served as Deputy Governor of the State of Illinois from 2003–2006, where he oversaw the state budget, policy, legislation, communications, and operations. Under his tenure, Illinois became the first state to guarantee health care for all children, the first state to offer pre-school to all 3 and 4 year olds, the first state to import prescription drugs from Europe and Canada, and the first state to convert its entire tollway system to Open Road Tolling. Under Tusk's leadership, Illinois reduced its state workforce by 20% without raising taxes.
After serving as Deputy Governor, Tusk served as Senior Vice President at Lehman Brothers, where he created the lottery monetization group and headed all of its efforts regarding U.S. based lotteries. Combining his backgrounds in finance and politics, Tusk developed a successful framework to help state's monetize their lotteries.
Before his appointment as Deputy Governor, Tusk served as Special Assistant to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, where he led the successful effort to re-write the New York City charter and created the Mayor's campaign promise index, making Bloomberg the nation's first public official to publicly report on the status of every one of his campaign promises.
Prior to joining the Bloomberg Administration, Tusk served as Communications Director for United States Senator Charles Schumer, handling communications, strategy and policy for the Senator, most notably in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks on New York City.
Tusk also served as Senior Advisor to New York City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, and was an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University. Tusk is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago Law School, and was named to Crain’s Business Weekly’s 40 under 40.

Anna Charlotta Schröderheim

Anna Charlotta Schröderheim, née Anna Charlotta von Stapelmohr, also called "Ann-Charlotte" or "Anne-Charlotte", (24 September 1754 – 1 January 1791), was a Swedish noble, wit and salonist, spouse of the politician Elis Schröderheim. She was one of the most known socialites of her time and became one of the more known symbols of the Gustavian age. She was the inspiration for several poets; poems by Crusenstople, Bellman and Carl Gustaf af Leopold was dedicated to her.
Biography.
Socialite.
Anna Charlotta was born daughter of the wealthy Christoffer Lorentz von Stapelmohr and Maria Lucretia Dittmer: her father was director of the sea customs and was ennobled in 1756. Her parents home was a center for the capital's high society and Charlotta was a celebrated beauty. After her marriage to the noble (since 1759) Elis Schröderheim in 1776, she became the greatest socialite and society hostess of Stockholm. Her husband was then minister and the second most powerful man in the country, and her salon became a center of the aristocracy, where her husbands ”amiable jokes" mingled with the conversation and sharp tongue of his spouse. She is described as passionate, intelligent and wit as a person, beautiful with ”burning brown eyes” to her appearance. She was a member of the order Stora Amaranther-orden (1779), and of the academy Utile Dulci. She was one of only three females known to have been a member of the Utile Dulci, the other being Anna Maria Lenngren and Anna Brita Wendelius.
The marriage was not a marriage of love, but rather a union of friendship. Several of the friends of the couple were pointed out as her lovers, and she was known for her love affairs, but her husband was tolerant, and the couple lived in harmony. In 1789, the young royal secretary Carl Wilhelm Seele was her lover: Seele was called "l'Adonis de la Roture" and known for changing clothes three or four times a day to ”coming, going and riding to demonstrate his beauty”.
Among her lovers were Crusenstolpe and his father. Several of her lovers belonged to the opposition of Gustav III, and her salon became a center of political opposition, where the political acts as well as the personal life of the monarch were exposed to criticism through witty remarks. This disturbed the political career of her spouse, a loyal supporter of the monarch, who demanded of him to close his home to his enemies and tell his wife not to interfere in politics. A conflict arose between Anna Charlotta and the monarch.
Scandal and death.
In 1790, Charlotta was pregnant by Seele. In contrast to his usual behavior, Schröderheim demanded a divorce and declared that the child was not his and would be taken from her and registered as dead after the birth. It became a scandal. The reason for the changed behavior of her husband was said to be the king: during a political disagreement, Gustav III, made a remark about her childless marriage and her latest interest in Bruse, one of his stable masters, upon which she answered him: "Your Majesty, we can not afford to keep an equerry"
This remark deeply offended the King, who quite correctly took it as a remark about his and the queen’s rumored relationship with the royal stable master, equerry Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila: the rumor at the time claimed that the King had asked Munck to impregnate the queen. 
The sympathies was largely on Anna Charlotta’s side during the scandal. She gave birth to a daughter 1 January 1791 and died ”of sorrow” after the childbirth. In 1796, Elsa Fougt gave a memorial speech to her in the order Stora Amaranther-orden: ""Court and city admired her exquisite taste, her playful mind. Learning and the beautiful arts were flattered by her support. Her house became the center of the best company and the school for good tone, the true amiability, the decent joy. One gathered around her, to hear her every word; one admired and praised her wit. Every whim was considered to be better than what preceded it, and there were those, who thought themselves to be wits, only by hearing her and repeating what she, even without effort, had babbled forth. So passed some happy years, by which she, flattered by everyone's applause and safe by the nature of her own good heart, free from sorrow abandoned herself to the shining pleasures of the grand world."" 
Her daughter, Charlotte Schröderheim, was raised as a foster-child at the home of her close friend, Beata Elisabeth Théel (1744–1805). In her memorial speech over Anna Charlotta Schröderheim, which can be described as a forceful defense of a controversial woman, Elsa Fougt describes her a person of great intellectual abilities who could have became much more if the attitude toward women had been more liberal: "the learned Utile Dulci was honored to count her among its members. How worthy was she not of this calling, and how long she could have gone in the learned professions, had she seen them as becoming of her sex"
In fiction.
Anna Charlotta Schröderheim has been portrayed by actress Brita Appelgren in the movie Ulla, min Ulla (1930) and by Renée Björling in the movie Två Konungar (1925).

Ruger Security Six

The Ruger Security Six and its variants, the Service Six and Speed Six are a product line of double action revolvers introduced in 1972 and manufactured by Sturm, Ruger & Company. These revolvers were marketed to law enforcement duty issue, military, and civilian self-defense markets.
Development and history.
The introduction of the Security Six and its variants marked Sturm Ruger's first attempt to enter the double action revolver market. The corporation's earlier designs had been Colt Peacemaker style single action revolvers. Ruger used investment casting for most parts in an effort to hold down production costs. As with all Ruger firearms, the Security Six revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for investment casting. The "six series" line enjoyed sales success because of their basic features, solid construction, and competitive pricing.
Various models were issued by US government agencies as diverse as the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Postal Service, Border Patrol, and numerous police agencies. The Security Six and its derivatives also became the standard issue service weapons of a large number of police departments, in addition many were exported overseas. While Ruger's Security Six line has been out of production since 1988, a total of over 1.5 million revolvers were produced and they remain well-liked and respected, as well as highly sought after in the second-hand market.
The Ruger GP-100 replaced the Security Six in the Ruger product line.
Features.
The Security Six and its variants were more or less identical in basic design, with the differences between the various models being expressed by the exact options and features available. Medium-framed in size, these revolvers were initially manufactured in a blued carbon steel finish; in 1975 stainless steel versions of all models were added to the lineup. Featuring six-round cylinders, the Security Six series represented one of the first modern revolver designs to feature the safer transfer-bar based lockwork, and was chambered for a variety of centerfire ammunition cartridges including .38 Special and .357 Magnum, as well as .38 S&W and 9x19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger). All Security Six series revolvers came with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplied wooden grips, however, some of the Speed and Service Six models were shipped with rubber Pachmayr grips containing the silver Ruger emblem in the 1980s.
Another desirable feature of the Security Six is the disassembly. Requiring only a flathead screwdriver or even an empty shell to take off one screw on the grips. This feature allows for easy cleaning and lubrication. 
Disassembly of the Security Six goes as follows:
1: Make sure the firearm is unloaded.
2: Turn out grip screw.
3: Remove Grips.
4: Compress main spring.
5: Insert pin and decompress main spring.
6: Remove main spring.
7: Remove hammer pin.
8: Remove hammer.
9: Release and remove trigger assembly.
10: Release and remove Cylinder.
Security Six.
Introduced in 1972, the Security Six was the original model of the new series. The majority of these guns were manufactured with adjustable open iron sights but a few were sold with fixed sights. Security Sixes could be ordered with either service or target shooting style square butt grips, and most were chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge which allowed for firing the shorter .38 Special. A number of dedicated .38 Special models were also built. Barrel lengths available on the Security Six included 2.75, 4, and 6 inches.
Service Six.
Brought out shortly after the Security Six, the Service Six model, or alternatively the "Police Service Six" was an attempt to capitalize on the lucrative law enforcement service revolver market. The Service Six was a basic fixed sight model, and like the Security Six mostly manufactured in .357 Magnum, however some police departments specified .38 Special-only and 9mm Luger chamberings. 9mm models boasted a cleverly designed patented sprung cylinder ring which engaged the grooves of the rimless 9mm semi automatic cases. Barrel length options for the Service Six included 2.75 and 4 inches.
Speed Six.
The Speed Six pistols mainly differed from the Service Sixes in that they were equipped with compact round-butt grip frames. The standard barrel lengths available for these models were the same as those for the Service Six. An attribute unique to the Speed Six model is that it was offered in .38 S&W chambering (in England known as the .380 British or .38-200) and exported to British Commonwealth countries such as India.

Ship mill

A ship mill is a type of watermill. The milling and grinding technology and the drive (waterwheel) are built on a floating platform on this type of mill.
Its first recorded use dates back to mid-6th century AD Italy.
Technology.
Between barge and boat well is the undershot water wheel, which is driven by the flowing water of the current. There is also evidence of water mills for which both sides had a narrower water wheel, similar to an old paddle steamer. The floating platform is anchored at the most intense point in the current, to the bridge piers for easy access to the mill, or to the shore.
Floating allows the mill to operate with the same power despite changing water levels. The efficiency of the mill can at best match a standard undershot mill. Ship mills could potentially run full-time, good for tasks that demanded constant power.
Ship mills could be drawn when needed (due to shipping, rafting, ice) to shore. In central Europe ship mills were, as most water and wind mills, owned by lords or monasteries. Ship mills in Central Europe have not remained; after the advent of riverboat traffic, they became a hindrance. Ship mills last about fifty years.
History.
There is historical evidence that the development of this type of mill dates back to the ingenious invention of Vitruvius, a Roman engineer of the 1st century BC. Vitruvius described a ship odometer working with a waterwheel attached to the ship hull. 
In the 537 siege of Rome, supplies were interrupted by the Goths from providing the population with vital flour from the surrounding water mills. Also, the aqueducts that supplied Rome with water and some cities which had water-driven mills could no longer work. The solution devised by the Eastern Roman general Belisarius was the "reverse principle of a water mill" - the ship mills, which were anchored on the Tiber river around Rome. It was a type of watermill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream, preferably close to bridges where the current is stronger. From then on, the ship mill spread throughout medieval Europe, reaching Paris (556) Geneva (563) and Dijon (c. 575) in quick succession. They remained a common sight in much of Europe until the 19th century, with a few of them surviving up to our time.
By the 10th century, the medieval ship mill had spread east to the Islamic world. It was employed along the Tigris at Mosul in 10th-century Iraq, where large ship mills made of wood and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from corn every day for the granary in Baghdad. In 1184, Ibn Jubayr described ship mills in the same region on the Khabur River. From the lack of records, it appears that they did not spread further to Iran.
The German terms ""Schiffsmühle"" and ""Schiffmühle"" are not clearly defined and in the literature are typically used twice. Both names are equivalent to coexist, but in the south-German and Alps areas, the first spelling (""Schiffs-"") for "ship mill" is used.

Kabiné Komara

Kabiné Komara (born 8 March 1950) (his given name is also variously reported as Kabinet, Kabineh, Kabinè)
Career and personal life.
Komara was born into a Maninka family from the interior area of Upper Guinea and pursued his education in the Guinean capital. In 1973, Komara received a Degree in Management from the "école supérieure d'administration" in Conakry. In later years he has studied at the Institut supérieur des affaires (ISA) Paris, at the University of Colorado, the École supérieure de commerce de Rennes, and at the American University in Cairo. Komara began his banking career at Crédit Suisse, Zurich, in 1975. Rising in business and government, in 1990 he was appointed to the Guinean CTRN ruling council in charge of Economic Planning & Cooperation. He also served as Assistant Director for Personnel in the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG)
2007 strikes.
During the 2007 Guinean general strike, the opposition Trades Union leadership named Komara as one of four acceptable candidates to be appointed Prime Minister, a job later given to Lansana Kouyaté. While there is was no indication he had campaigned for the post, he later published an open letter thanking the opposition. He was described at the time by the international press as an "apolitical technocrat".
2008 appointment.
The National Council for Democracy and Development leadership under self-proclaimed President Camara had promised to choose a civilian Prime Minister in the week prior to Komara's appointment and after the 2008 Guinean coup d'état. A statement outlined the role of Prime Minister as:
In charge of controlling, coordinating and directing governmental action. He is responsible to the President for the proper functioning of government. With the President, the PM determines the membership of the government, who may also be named by ordnance. He presides over the Council of Ministers in place of the Head of State. The PM names civil service employees and directs government administration through authority delegated by the President of the Republic. The Prime Minister may represent the Head of State at sub-regional, regional, and international meetings. He is responsible for maintaining a political and social dialog."
Early in the morning of 30 December, government radio in Conakry read out a statement naming Komara as the new Prime Minister of Guinea. Kabiné Komara released a statement on the 30th accepting the post, after a special flight carried him from Cairo to Conakry, via Paris and Dakar.
Camara appointed a new government headed by Komara on 14 January 2009. The government was composed of soldiers and technocrats and did not include any political parties. It included 27 ministers and two secretaries of state.
Komara remained in office for about a year. Eventually, as part of a political transition, opposition leader Jean-Marie Doré was appointed to replace him; Doré took office on 26 January 2010, succeeding Komara.

1947 Cotton Bowl Classic

The 1947 Cotton Bowl Classic was a post-season college football bowl game between the Arkansas Razorbacks and the . Arkansas and LSU tied the game, later referred to as the Ice Bowl, 0-0. The two teams would meet again in the Cotton Bowl Classic in 1966.
Setting.
Arkansas and LSU had enjoyed a neighboring-state rivalry beginning in 1901. The two teams had not met since 1936, the end of a 23-year run of meetings in Shreveport. The 9-1 Tigers, led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle, were not invited to play in the 1947 Sugar Bowl, and instead matched up with the rival Razorbacks. Arkansas entered at 6-3-1, losing at Texas and , versus , and tying Oklahoma A&M. The rain, sleet, snow, and ice from a winter storm would keep many members of the sellout crowd home, but 38,000 still showed up to watch the icy skirmish.
LSU was 1-3 in bowl games previous to the Ice Bowl, and Arkansas was 0-0-1, with their tie in the 1934 Dixie Classic.
Game summary.
The Razorbacks were statistically beaten by the Tigers, who held a 15-1 advantage in first downs. LSU also held a yardage advantage of 271-54. The Razorback defense stiffened in the red zone, however, holding the Tigers off the board from 1, 6, 7, and 8 yards out. Despite the cold and bad conditions, the final two plays were very dramatic. Tittle threw a pass to Jeff Adams, who was running to the end zone, but Clyde Scott of Arkansas tackled him at the one. LSU was in position for a game winning field goal, but there was a bad snap, and the game ended with a tie.
Tittle was named the game's Most Valuable Player.

IR-40

IR-40 is an Iranian 40 megawatt (thermal) heavy water reactor under construction near Arak. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed on May 5, 2003 that construction would begin in June 2004. Iran announced that the reactor will begin nuclear operation in 2014.
History.
Iran's leadership decided to begin designing the reactor in the 1980s. The basic design was completed in 2002. The current Iranian research reactor, Tehran Research Reactor, is nearing the end of its operational life having been in use since 1967.
The reactor was originally going to be constructed at a location in Esfahan, though after the designs were completed Iran decided to build instead at its present location near Arak. In August 2006, mixed reports came out about when the reactor would go into operation, one stating that the plant would start up in 2009, while another reported that operation would be postponed until 2011.
Press reports indicate that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the reactor in June 2013, on the occasion of the reactor vessel installation which is the final precursor prior to commencement of operation. 
Role in Iran's nuclear program.
Iran states that the reactor will only be used for research and development, medical and industrial isotope production. On June 16, 2010 Iran announced plans to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor by September 2011 and to build a new 20 MW reactor for radioisotope production within five years.
Aspects of IR-40's design will also serve as a prototyping and testbed for the larger 336 megawatt Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant under construction near Ahvaz.
Proliferation concerns.
There are some proliferation concerns about the reactor's ability to produce enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons each year. However the IAEA has reported that it found no indication of ongoing reprocessing activities, required to extract plutonium from the spent fuel. In full operation, it is expected that the reactor will produce from to of plutonium a year within its spent nuclear fuel.
Natural-uranium fueled heavy-water reactors were originally designed for producing weapons-grade plutonium usable for construction of nuclear weapons. Analysis suggests that Iran could extract 8–10 kilograms of high purity Pu-239 annually from fuel irradiated in IR-40. This, according to the IAEA, is sufficient weapons-grade material to produce 1 to 2 nuclear weapons annually. Iran has denied access to the IR-40 for design information verification, despite the IAEA's right to conduct such verification.
As a result of concerns that this plutonium would support weapons development, the IAEA Deputy Director-General for Safeguards, Olli Heinonen proposed a reactor redesign to a reactor using slightly enriched uranium fuel rather than natural uranium. Use of enriched uranium fuel combined with extended operations would reduce the reactor's ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium.
Iran has indicated they do not intend to reprocess IR-40 spent fuel to recover weapons-grade plutonium, nor operate under a low burnup regime that could produce weapons-grade plutonium. Originally a hot cell facility at the Arak site was planned, described as capable of handling irradiated fuel and targets (such as targets for production of medical radioisotopes) from the IR-40, but in 2004 plans for hot cells at Arak were removed. However some proliferation experts have expressed concern that once sufficient fuel has been irradiated Iran may modify this facility or build a separate reprocessing facility to recover weapons-grade plutonium.

Cornelius P. Cotter

Cornelius P. Cotter, professor of political science at Stanford University, was the executive director of the Republican Committee on Program in Progress. The committee was established in 1959 by Republican National Chairman Meade Alcorn. The idea for the committee grew from the concern of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and other party leaders that if the GOP did not effectively articulate imaginative solutions to the challenges in both foreign and domestic policies facing America in the 1960s and 1970s, the party would face a series of defeats at the polls comparable to what happened in 1958.
The committee consisted of forty-four Republicans chosen from office holders, party officials, former members of the Eisenhower Administration, and leading figures in business, education, labor, agriculture, and the professions. The committee was chaired by Charles H. Percy, president of Bell and Howell.
A native of New York City, Cotter served in the Marshall Islands during World War II. He received his Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University in 1949, his Masters of Public Administration from Harvard in 1951, and completed further studies at the London School of Economics. As a Professor of Political Science, Cotter served on the faculties of Stanford University, Wichita State University, and University of Wisconsin Milwaukee.

Life and work.
Robbins obtained a B.A. in government from Harvard University in 1965, and a Ph.D. in Sociology, at the University of North Carolina in 1973. He subsequently held teaching or research positions at Queens College (CUNY), the New School for Social Research, Yale University and the Graduate Theological Union. He has authored numerous articles and reviews for sociological and religious journals.
Among Robbins' early work are notable studies comparing contemporary and historical controversies, such as the mass suicides among the Russian Old Believers and those that occurred in Jonestown in 1979, or present-day agitation against "cults" and similar controversies surrounding Catholicism, Mormonism and Freemasonry in the early nineteenth century. From the mid-1980s, Robbins became increasingly focused on legal and church-state issues related to new religious movements. He has written extensively on the legal and social-science issues related to the alleged use of mind control by therapeutic and religious groups. Together with his colleague, the psychologist Dick Anthony, Robbins has been one of the most prominent critics of the anti-cult movement's views on brainwashing.

The E.N.D

The E.N.D (an abbreviation of "The Energy Never Dies") is the fifth studio album by American hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas. It was released on June 3, 2009. Critics described the album as containing more anthemic and inspirational songs in the group's bid to appeal to a new generation of music listeners.
Three promotional singles, "Imma Be", "Alive" and "Meet Me Halfway", were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album's release. The album gave the group their first, second, and third US number one hits with "Boom Boom Pow", "I Gotta Feeling", and "Imma Be" which topped the "Billboard" Hot 100 for 12, 14, and 2 weeks respectively. "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta Feeling" led the Hot 100 back to back, putting the band at number 1 on the chart for a record breaking 26 consecutive weeks (half a year). The third single, "Meet Me Halfway", along with the first two, topped several charts around the world including the United Kingdom and Australia. As of June 2011, the album has sold over 11 million copies worldwide, making it one of the biggest commercial successes for the music industry in recent years.
The E.N.D was nominated for six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Album of the Year, and Record of the Year, winning Best Pop Vocal Album.
Background and development.
The album name was thought about since 2006, around the time Fergie released "The Dutchess". Originally, they were going to call it "Evolution", but that was also the name for what would become Ciara's . The album title was then tentatively changed to "From Roots to Fruits", before the group decided this title may be better suited for a future compilation album. The name was changed again to "The Energy Never Dies", before being shortened to "The E.N.D." The name was confirmed by will.i.am in an interview promoting the release of his third studio album, "Songs About Girls".
In an interview with "Billboard" magazine, will.i.am stated that ""The E.N.D."" stands for "The Energy Never Dies", which describes his model for a project that will be living and frequently updated throughout its designated cycle. "It's a diary [...] of music that at any given time, depending on the inspiration, you can add to it," the artist/producer/songwriter explains."I'm trying to break away from the concept of an album. What is an album when you put 12 songs on iTunes and people can pick at it like scabs? That's not an album. There is no album anymore." He described the music as "a lot of dance stuff, real melodic, electronic, soulful. We call it, like, electric static funk, something like that." Will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' "My People". "The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song 'My People' (he sings the chorus) - that . . . is wild," will.i.am said, "That's the reason why this record sounds the way it does - my three months in Australia."
Critical reception.
According to review aggregator Metacritic, "The E.N.D." received an average of 60 out of 100 indicating mixed to average reviews from music critics, based on fifteen critiques, higher than their 2005 album "Monkey Business" but lower than their 2003 breakout "Elephunk", with critics agreeing that the album has more of a dance-oriented sound than its predecessors. However it is here that opinions began to differ with "Entertainment Weekly" describing the album as "pure Top 40 nirvana", while PopMatters concludes that after listening to the album and "dancing all night [...] you just may not be able to respect yourself in the morning". The album received six nominations for the 2010 Grammy Awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album on January 31, 2010. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to Taylor Swift's "Fearless".
Chart performance.
The album debuted at number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand and three in the United Kingdom. The album debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200 chart selling 304,000 copies. The album has spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the "Billboard" 200. The E.N.D. was the 7th best-selling album of 2009 in the U.S. As of March 2011, the album has sold over 3,000,000 copies in the US alone.
The album experienced a strong run in the UK Album Charts, peaking at number three for eight non-consecutive weeks. In Australia, the album was number 84 on the decade-end chart. The decade-end chart also revealed the album to be the third most successful album of 2009.
In France, the album proved to be very successful. It spent 55 weeks inside of the top 10 with 11 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1.
In the week of June 25, 2011, the album climbed from No. 62 to No. 18 as "The Beginning" re-reached No. 1.
This increase made it "The E.N.D.'s" highest charting position since September 2010 there.
Tour.
"The E.N.D. World Tour" was the third concert tour by the group, in support of their fifth studio album, "The E.N.D.". The tour began in Japan on September 15, 2009, with shows also performed in Australia and New Zealand in 2009. The group toured in North America starting in February 2010, with dates also planned for Europe starting in Dublin, Ireland in May. The group performed 2 shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2009 as a warm up to their extensive North American tour. The tour was also expected to reach South America and more parts of Asia during 2010. It is the group's biggest tour production-wise to date, with the group's female vocalist Fergie stating that they are "trying to up game" and the shows will "utilize a lot of the technology that's out there". The E.N.D. World Tour is backed by presenting sponsor BlackBerry, and Bacardi as the official spirit of the tour. The tour had a total of 115 shows.
The E.N.D. Summer 2010 Canadian Invasion Tour: Remix Collection.
The E.N.D. Summer 2010 Canadian Invasion Tour: Remix Collection is a remix album by The Black Eyed Peas. It was released on iTunes in Canada only, during the Canadian leg of The E.N.D. World Tour. It mostly features remixes of the singles taken from their fifth studio album "The E.N.D", most of which appeared on their "Invasion of..." series. It also features a remix of "Let's Get It Started" taken from their third studio album "Elephunk"; the remix was also a bonus track on the deluxe edition of "The E.N.D."
The image on the cover is a still from the "Imma Be" music video. It is the first cover in 5 years to feature a physical appearance of the group, the last one being on the single cover for "Don't Lie", although they did later appear in cartoon form on the single cover for their following single "My Humps".

Somali presidential election, 2009

An indirect presidential election was held in Somalia on 30 January 2009. Due to the security situation in Baidoa, it was held in Djibouti. President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed won in a run-off election.
Background.
The election was necessitated following the resignation of President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed on 29 December 2008, over the dismissal of the government of Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein which was not approved by the Transitional Federal Parliament. As such, the Speaker of Parliament Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe shall act as interim President until the Parliament elects a new President based on the Transitional Federal Charter within 30 days. Postponing the election until a new interim parliament, which would likely include moderate Islamist opposition, was considered, but Interim President Aden Madobe stated that a new president would be selected within the constitutionally mandated 30-day period. On 11 January 2009 African Union Peace and Security Commissioner Ramtane Lamamra announced that the election would take place on 26 January, with preparations including nominations of candidates commencing on 20 January.
Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein announced on 15 January 2009 that he would like to become president. Other official candidates include MP Mohamed Afrah Qanyare (an ex-Mogadishu warlord), MP Hassan Abshir Farah (a former prime minister), Ali Mohammed Ghedi (also a former prime minister), Ali Khalif Galaid (another former prime minister) and Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan (an ex-Kismayo warlord); ARS Chairman Sharif Ahmed also stated he was a contender for the presidency. In total, at least sixteen candidates have stated they want to become President; the PM and the ARS chairman are seen as the most likely contenders. Due to difficulties in picking the next president, the deadline was considered to be extended; despite strong pressure from the international community, the original deadline of 28 January 2009 was extended by five days, meaning the election is to be held by 2 February 2009.
As planned, the Transitional Federal Parliament was enlarged to include 200 representatives from the Islamist opposition and 75 representatives of citizens' groups and diaspora representatives; the former group was sworn in on 27 January 2009. The 275 existing MPs voted 211 to 6 in favour with 3 abstentions to enlarging the TFP.
Candidates.
A total of fourteen candidates formally filed to stand in the election. The candidates were:
Results.
There were three rounds of voting. There would have been less if one candidate garnered more than two thirds of the vote in an earlier round. The first round of voting reduced the field of candidates to six, the second to just two, with the winner decided in a run-off round.
As the first round of voting began, several candidates withdrew, increasing the speculation that the vote would largely be a choice between Nur Hassan Hussein and Sharif Ahmed. In the first round, Sharif Ahmed got 215 votes, Maslah Mohamed Siad 60 and Nur Hassan Hussein 59; Nur Hassan Hussein then withdrew his candidacy, thus likely sealing the election of Sharif Ahmed as president. Reportedly, Ali Khalif Galaid also withdrew. All candidates except Maslah Mohamed Siad withdrew after the first round of voting; Sharif Ahmed won the run-off with 293 to 126 votes.

Romani people in Slovakia

According to the last census from 2011, there were 105,738 persons counted as Romani people in Slovakia, or 2.0% of the population. The Romani are the second-largest ethnic minority in Slovakia after Hungarians and they live mostly in the eastern parts of the country.
Other sources claim that 7.5% of inhabitants of Slovakia (402,840 people) may be Romani.
History.
The first record of sightings of small groups of Romani within the area of present-day Slovakia are from 1322 AD, when the region was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Major waves of Romani nomads were recorded from 1417 onwards. In 1423 they received a decree from the Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxemburg at Szepes Castle, granting them Europe-wide right of passage and the right to settle. They proved to be useful metal workers for the royal armies fighting the Turks. 
Through the ensuing centuries, whilst in western and central Europe Romani were treated violently and often expelled, the Hungarian Kingdom and Habsburg Monarchy in general provided a tolerant and stable safe-haven for the Romani community. In the 18th century, Joseph II of the house of Habsburg attempted to 'civilize' the Romani, for example by prohibiting their dress and customs and educating them. However these efforts generally failed. On the other hand, increasing repression of the Romani in the Czech, Polish and Austrian lands caused them to become concentrated in the more tolerant regions of Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Russia.
20th century.
After the repressive Romani policies of the first Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1939), the communist government of 1945-1989 attempted to integrate the Romani into the majority population through obligatory education and employment, and the formation of Romani organizations. The nomadic way of life was banned in 1958. Parts of the Romani population were also transferred from Slovakia into the country's Czech regions. 
Though these policies were partly successful, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, the Romani have once again found themselves on the margins of the society. On the one hand, there is a generous social system, but the system fails to effectively integrate them into the mainstream society.

Margaretha Donner

Anna "Margaretha" Donner, née "Anna Margaretha Lyhtberg", (11 February 1726 – 24 September 1774) was a Swedish business person. She was known as "Donner Mum", "Madam Donner", and "Mr Madame Donner". 
Born in Visby to merchants Mathias Lythberg and Johanna Wihadi, she was given a good education, and was active as her father's business assistant. In 1744, she married the German merchant Jürgen Hinrich Donner from Lübeck. They settled in Visby on Gotland in 1746, and had four children. They bought a building in Visby were they founded an empire of import and export with Germany and Great Britain. The building is now known as ”The Donner House”, and the square by which the building is located was to be known as: ”Donner's place”. Margaretha was the company's accountant. When she became a widow in 1751, she took sole control over the business as director. She made herself responsible for the export, and created a merchant fleet with twenty ships. She also founded a factory on Gotland. She was appreciated by her employees, and called ”Donner Mum” by some, and ”Madam Donner” by others: some business-partners could not imagine a woman as head of such a big business empire, and by them she was sometimes called ”Mr. Madam Donner”. She helped her two sons to start their own business, but she did not allow them any influence in her own affairs, and she did not acquaint them with the main business until after she acquired tuberculosis, of which she died at Visby in 1774. The Donner empire expanded under her sons, both of whom included their wives in their work. The business eventually went bankrupt in 1845.

Skishing

Skishing is a variant on saltwater shorefishing that involves wearing a buoyant wetsuit and swimming out from shore with flippers to fish with rod and reel (typically a surfcasting rod), often using live eels. It is practiced as a means of getting further out to sea in order to increase the chances of catching a fish and can be dangerous. The term skishing is a portmanteau of water-skiing and fishing because when hooked the stripers pull the angler through the water. Skishing has been described as extreme surfcasting.
One enthusiast of skishing believes that "hard core" surf casters aren't fond of the activity and consider it cheating.
Skishing was the subject of an article in "Forbes" magazine. The activity was invented by Paul Melnyk, a cabinet maker from Montauk, New York. Melnyk has explained that the activity is similar of skiing because "if you hook a fish over thirty pounds, it will generally take you for a ride".
A description of skishing on Stripercoast Surfcasters web forum as told by Jacob Freeman.
" It really has to be experienced to be understood, but it's definitely not for everyone. I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not at least a little crazy. But for me, skishing is to surfcasting, as a hurricane is to a windy day. 
To be immersed in the element that holds your quarry, bass sometimes swimming so close to you that you can kick them, feeling the raw power of a big bass pull you around, wrestling one on one with a big fish in their element is unreal. They don't give up when they're still in the water, and you can't lift a big bass out of the water when you're swimming, so it can become a friggen wrestling match until you get your hook out if the fish is still green. I always crush the barbs of my hooks for an easier release anyway, so sometimes you can just give them some slack and they'll release themselves if it's just a lip hook. With an 11' rod, you really have a lot more leverage than most would think, and with some practice you can horse a fish in (or pull yourself closer to it) rather quickly. 
Skishing also provides the surfcaster with access to many very fishy areas that are not accessible from shore or frequented by boats due to the hazardous rocks and reefs. How many times have you been standing on a rock or on the beach and the fish are busting beyond your casting range? That's frustrating. Skishing lets you get out to where they are." 
SKISHING description by Paul Melnyk - MONTAUK, N.Y. - It was an extraordinary feeling for me to be floating weightless in this dynamic sea, and I felt as thought I had shed every pound of excess baggage as I rode the tide . . . Fighting a substantial fish while swimming is a unique experience. A balance must be achieved between the hunter and the prey. Any variation to this equilibrium causes a loss of control as the fish pulls. I was kicking hard to keep myself upright, fighting the fish while using my whole body as leverage. . . A swarm of splashing bodies soon surrounded me. [http://www.montaukconfidential.com] </ref>

Margareta i Kumla

Margareta i Kumla, (Floruit 1628), also called the "Sibylla of Kumla" ("The Prophetess of Kumla"), was a Swedish visionary, who claimed to be obsessed. She became the target for pilgrimages when claiming to be the channel of the words of the angels.
Margareta was born to Johannes Laurentii, who was since 1619 the Vicar of Kumla. In 1626, she is described as a teenager. That year, she said she had visions of a white bird and a black man. The black man tried to convince her to abandon her beliefs. At the same time, both the vicarage and the church begun to experience the phenomena of poltergeist.
The 30 October 1626, Margareta was to have said "blasphemies" and called upon Satan; afterward, she claimed to have had a visit from seven high rank devils. 22 October, she said she was visited by three angels with burning candles, among them the Archangel Michael. She was then unconscious for 24 hours. When she awakened, she claimed that angels and devils had fought for her soul and that she had seen the "Glory of the Lord". Between 9 December 1626 and 3 January 1627, she said she had been visited by a litany of angels, and that she had now became their channel, and that what she said was in fact their words. Margareta now foretold that a miracle in Poland should create peace in the war, that a plague should come; she talked about the Sun and the stars and also about clothes, condemning the use of crinolines, big starch collars for vicars, many colors and that blue starch was the vomit of Satan while white starch was pleasing to the Lord.
The "Sibylla of Kumla" had now became known in the entire country, and people from all over the country, among them also the clergy, traveled to Kumla to witness fire, burning blankets, to hear shouts and heavenly choirs and to see Margareta perform a miracle when the angel Gabriel allegedly cured a boy from deafness through her. Margareta stated that the angels had promised to dictate a letter through her, which was to be delivered to the king by her father.
Bishop Laurentius Paulinus Gothus was given order to examine the whole affair. The 10 February 1628, the King ordered her "Foolisheness and insanity" to be stopped; the pilgrimages to her was to be stopped by the threat of imprisonment, and Margareta herself was also to be imprisoned if she did not stop. With this, the pilgrimages to Kumla ended. There is no information about Margareta after this.

1er Régiment de Spahis Marocains

<br>
The First Regiment of Moroccan Spahis is an armored regiment of the modern French Army. It was established in 1914 as a mounted cavalry unit recruited primarily from indigenous Moroccan horsemen. The regiment saw service in both the First World War and the Second World War as part of the Forces Françaises Libres as well as post-war service in the French-Indochina War and elsewhere. The modern regiment continues the traditions of all former Spahi regiments in the French Army of Africa.
World War I service.
The regiment was organized from existing cavalry squadrons under General of Division, later Marshal, Hubert Lyautey in 1914. It saw service on the Eastern Front and the Western front, including the Battle of the Marne. The regiment also served in Greece, capturing the standard of the 1st regiment of Evzones. The initial title of the regiment was that of régiment de marche de chasseurs indigènes à cheval (RMCIC). Later it was renamed régiment de marche de spahis marocains (RMSM). The French Army had raised four regiments of indigenous Spahi cavalry in both Algeria and Tunisia during the 19th century and extended this designation to the Moroccan mounted units recruited after 1908.
Inter-War Service.
Between the First and Second World Wars, the regiment was deployed in Syria as part of the post-war occupation of parts of the Ottoman Empire. It received a battle honor at Beirut in 1920 as part of the pacification efforts. As before, the regiment was organized during this period as the 
2l e régiment de spahis marocains (2LE RSM or 21st regiment of Moroccan spahis) as well as the 1er régiment de spahis marocains (1 RSM or first regiment of Moroccan Spahis).
World War II service (Vichy France).
During 1939, the Regiment first organized two units of light infantry scouts for reconnaissance. The main part of the 1st Regiment served in Syria under Vichy command. It was subsequently deployed in Morocco where it resisted the allied invasion Operation Torch. After the defeat of the Vichy Forces in Morocco, the regiment fought near Royan, France in 1945. It was eventually dissolved and merged with the 8th Regiment of Dragoons.
World War II service (Free France).
At the beginning of July 1940 less than half of the first squadron and a few other spahis joined the British in Palestine to become part of the Free French forces. After being expanded and mechanised this part of the regiment fought against the Italians in Eritrea and against the Vichy French in Syria.
In 1941, the squadron was mechanised, losing its former role as a horse mounted unit made up primarily of Berber and Arab troopers with mostly French officers. The effect of these changes was to greatly increase the proportion of French personnel and the squadron become a regiment.
The regiment was then organized as the 1er régiment de marche de spahis (1st regiment march regiment of spahis). The regiment then joined the British 8th Army fighting in the North African Campaign before becoming part of the column under Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque. Eventually it became the reconnaissance regiment of the French 2nd Armored Division, participating in the Liberation and taking heavy casualties in France and Germany.
Post-War service.
As an armoured unit the regiment was sent to French Indochina in 1947, but was returned briefly to Morocco and Algeria before serving in the occupation of West Germany as part of the French zone of occupation, and then the North Atlantic Treaty Organization serving in Germany. The unit returned to France in 1984 as part of the French rapid reaction force where it is headquartered at Valence, Drôme.
The regiment was also part of Opération Daguet in 1991 as part of the French contingent in the 1st Gulf War. It remains headquartered in Valence.
Present day.
Following the end of the Algerian War in 1962, all but one of the North African Spahi regiments in the French Army were disbanded. The one exception was the 1er Régiment de Spahis Marocains, which was retained in service both because of its distinguished record in World War II and in order to preserve the traditions of the entire Spahi branch. Features such as the white burnous (cloak) and red sash of the historical Spahi uniform are still worn by the modern regiment on parade.
The regiment is currently part of the 6th French Light Armored Brigade and has been since 1999. The regiment's armored vehicles core consists of 48 AMX, 90 VAB and 110 trucks. The Regiment trains new recruits at headquarters, including armored vehicle crewmen and various mechanical trades as well as musicians and non-commissioned officers.

Anatoly Tikhai

Father Anatoly Tikhai was a Romanian hieromonk who came to Japan in the early 1870s to assist Fr. Nicholas in his missionary work in Japan. Initially, the future St. Nicholas of Japan assigned Fr. Anatoly to his original church in Hakodate on Hokkaido island in northern Japan. During his years in Japan before he returned to Russia due to illness, Archimandrite Anatoly organized and taught schools in Hakodate and Osaka as well as serving as dean of the language school and organizing the seminary in Tokyo.
Life.
Fr. Anatoly was originally from Bessarabia. He was born 23 November 1839 in Tărăsăuţi, Hotin district in northern part of Moldova (Bessarabia). He graduated from the Chişinău Theological Seminary and from the Kiev Theological Academy and lived on Mount Athos for four years before he was assigned to assist Fr. Nicholas with his mission work in Japan.
The hieromonk Anatoly arrived in Japan during December 1871 while Fr. Nicholas' activities were still centered in Hakodate. After reviewing the status of the missionary effort in Japan with Fr. Anatoly, Fr. Nicholas assigned Fr. Anatoly to the existing parish at Hakodate, thus continuing the community that had formed there. This allowed Fr. Nicholas to move his activities to Edo (Tokyo). 
In 1873, Fr. Anatoly established the Motomachi Orthodox Primary School in Hakodate where he taught for the next seven years. By 1880, the school had an enrollment of 300. In 1880, Fr. Anatoly was raised to the rank of Archimandrite and also was called by Bp. Nicholas to come to the Kanda Surugadai headquarters in Tokyo to become the dean of the language school and the newly organized seminary. Here he taught theology to the seminarians and assisted Bp. Nicholas. As the Mission expanded, Fr. Anatoly was assigned in 1882 to organize a mission school in Osaka.
In the late 1880s Archimandrite Anatoly's health began to fail, and in the summer of 1890 he returned to Russia where he reposed in 1893.

Mumbai Rajdhani Express

The 12951/12952 Mumbai Rajdhani Express is a super fast express train of Rajdhani class belonging to Indian Railways that runs between Mumbai and Delhi in India. It was introduced on 17 May 1972 between the then Bombay Central and New Delhi. Since the time of its introduction, the train has become so popular that, as of May 2012 its reservation chart is prepared only 15 minutes before departure. It is a daily service. It operates as train number 12951 from Mumbai Central to New Delhi and as train number 12952 in the reverse direction.
Coaches.
The Mumbai Rajdhani generally has one AC 1st Class coach, five AC 2 tier class coaches, two pantry cars, two luggage cum generator coaches & up to eleven AC 3 tier coaches taking the total up to 21 coaches. Since its inception, the Mumbai Rajdhani ran with 16 coaches. However, the conventional rakes were replaced by Linke-Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches for this train in 2004 and the number of coaches was also increased to 19 including the pantry cars.The number of coaches again was increased to 21 by the Western Railways to accommodate more passengers in June 2012.
Service.
The 12951/12952 Mumbai Rajdhani Express is the fastest train on the Mumbai - Delhi sector and the fastest Rajdhani train as well as the second fastest in India. Mumbai Rajdhani Express is the first Rajdhani to get Alstom-LHB Coaches in India. It used to run six days a week until September 2000 after which Railways decided to run it daily. In its early days, it used to cover the distance of 1385 kilometres in each direction in 19 hours and 5 minutes. However, after the electrification of the route, the speed of the train improved and as of September 2012, it takes 15 hours 50 mins when operating as train number 12951 at an average speed of 90.46 km/h (excluding halts) while on its return journey as train number 12952 takes 16 hrs 05 mins at an average speed of 89.00 km/h (excluding halts) thus making it the fastest train on the Mumbai - Delhi sector. Before the introduction of the LHB coaches the maximum speed that could be attained with the conventional rakes was 130 kmph. After their introduction, the LHB coaches enhanced the speed of the Rajdhani to more than 130 kmph and even touching 140 kmph mark at times.
Traction.
When introduced, the Mumbai Rajdhani was hauled by a single WDM-2 diesel locomotive and WAP alternating current locos for electric traction. For some years, a double-headed engine was also used to maintain speed. Diesel engines were used between Mumbai and Vadodara, which necessitated the change of locos. Dual traction AC-DC W-CAM 2P locos were introduced in 1993, which made the hauling of train on electrical traction possible up to Mumbai Central. It used to depart with WCAM 2P locomotive from Mumbai central in order to use Mumbai's DC traction wires up to Vile Parle. . From 8 February 2012, Mumbai Rajdhani is hauled by Gaziabad (GZB)WAP-5 from end to end. The Western railway completed DC Electric Conversion to AC on 5 February 2012. The work was done on Vile Parle - Churchgate section.

Victor Pokrovsky

Victor Alexandrovich Pokrovsky was a choir director, translator, and music arranger. He worked for the Metropolitan Sergius (Tikhomirov) of Japan at Holy Resurrection Cathedral (Tokyo, Japan) from 1924 until 1962—except for during World War II and some of the first decade after the war. He followed in a tradition of Russian missionaries of bringing the Gospel to new people in their language. In Japan, he followed in the tradition of Ss. Innocent of Moscow and Nicholas of Japan, and of Nicholas's successor Sergius. In regard to liturgical music of the Japanese Orthodox Church, Victor Pokrovsky was to Sergius as Yakov Tikhai was to St. Nicholas. Victor successfully brought the Russian liturgical music masters to the Japanese in their own language. Metr. Sergius invited Victor, an émigré of the Russian civil war, to Tokyo to help him introduce 19th and 20th century Russian liturgical works in Japanese. Their close collaboration continued until World War II brought it to an end.
Life.
Victor studied for four years at the Kazan Ecclesiastical Seminary before entering Kazan University in 1914. As a university student he sang with the Morreff Choir, which Mr. Ivan Kolchin (later choir director of Holy Trinity Cathedral in San Francisco) also joined, and attended the conductor class at Kazan Hummert Music School. After three years of student life, he was called into the Army as an officer, but was released after the February Revolution. He then returned to the Kazan University for his fourth year.
After the Bolshevik coup of 1917, he was recalled to army service in 1918 into the White Army, to advance eventually to the rank of Captain. As the Red Army advanced, he was forced to leave Kazan and retreat with the White Army across Siberia. With the end of the Civil War, he ended up in Manchuria and was discharged on May 12, 1923. Having lost everything, including his family, he set to organizing a choir to earn a living. As Manchuria included a large Russian population prior to the war that supported and operated the Trans-Siberian Railway short cuts to Vladivostok, a Russian-based lifestyle was available for his choir to work in. Indeed, the Harbin Archdiocese was active, as the situation in Russia deteriorated, including supporting the Church of Japan.
After the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1, 1923, severely damaged the Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Tokyo, the then Archbishop Sergius often visited Harbin to obtain support for restoring the Cathedral. Amongst his activities, Sergius was looking for a capable leader for the choir at the cathedral. Among the candidates that the archbishop interviewed he liked the music of Victor Pokrovsky who was directing the choir at the Holy Theotokos Church in Harbin. Invited by the archbishop, Victor moved to Japan in 1924 to form a full-scale choir at the Holy Resurrection Cathedral and to introduce the new Russian masterpieces, such as those by Arkhangelsky and Kastalsky.
For the next sixteen years Victor was deeply engaged in developing a first-class choir and learning Japanese so as to translate and arrange the new masterpieces for the choir. During this time he found time to marry a Russian young lady, but suffered tragedy when she died in childbirth, leaving him a son to raise. A couple of years later he married again, to a young lady from Harbin with whom he had two daughters.
He and the archbishop, later named Metropolitan of All Japan, worked closely as the choir developed and the Cathedral was restored, until in 1940 the militaristic government, championing extreme nationalism, forced the non-Japanese leaders in the Church of Japan to "retire." Now, Victor searched for a new position. He was invited to a position in San Francisco, but the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred before their ship could leave Japan. Thus, he and his family spent the war in Japan, first living in Yokohoma and then later during and after the war in Karuizawa in the Japanese Alps. The last time they saw Metr. Sergius was when he came to Yokohoma during the summer of 1943 to baptize their second daughter. But, in the chaos of the war Victor was able to travel from Karuizawa to attend Sergius' funeral.
The war years proved to be very difficult, often living a starvation diet and, for Victor, an arrest on spying charges. It was many years before the family could return to Tokyo, but after returning Victor was invited by the new ruling bishop, Bishop Ireney, to resume his position directing the Holy Resurrection Cathedral choir. He restored the choir and again continued the work that was interrupted in 1940. Then in 1962, Victor, with his wife and younger daughter, immigrated to the United States where he led choirs in a number of parishes before retiring in 1972 in Vienna, Virginia. He died on February 12, 1990, and is buried at St. Tikhon's Orthodox Monastery (South Canaan, Pennsylvania), a place that he said reminded him of the Russia he left so many years before.
Musical Work.
Much of the following is based upon a study of Pokrovsky's musical work by Maria Junko Matsushima, of the Holy Annunciation Church in Nagoya, Japan.
Victor Pokrovsky was 27 years old when he assumed his duties under Metropolitan Sergius. As with the earlier Russian missionaries, St. Nicholas of Japan and Metr. Sergius himself, he began his work first learning the Japanese language as the grammatical and syllablical differences between Japanese and Slavonic made it difficult to translate and fit words to the musical notes. This was hard work, and in accomplishing this task he was assisted for many years by Father Job Hibi and a seminary student Jacob who later was ordained Father Jacob. He frequently worked until two or three o'clock in the morning.
He worked hard developing the cathedral choir, and in this work he also had the full support of Sergius. He was very strict in his rehearsals, sometimes bringing some of the young women singers to tears, but he did this for the love of the music and a loving integrity of the choir and choir members as a superior singing group. Rehearsals were held twice a week, Wednesday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Often Sergius sat in back, listening to their singing, and even chided some lazy choir members.
In time the choir recognized this discipline and personally came to Victor to acknowledge his intent. Victor worked carefully on the timing and the flow of the services. He coordinated tones with the clergy so they and the choir remained in harmony. Yet, during the service he could quickly adjust the choir's pitch to fit the intonation of the clergy when necessary. For Victor, the services were a whole, not a bunch of pieces. In this even, Metropolitan Sergius was careful, often heard coordinating on which Cherubic hymn version Victor would sing that day so that he could decide on his pitch.
The choir's repertory expanded quickly. They sang the music of Tchaikovsky, Smolensky, Strokin, Chesnokov, Arkhangelsky, and Kastalsky. Some years later, thanks to his pupil Tito Kato, Victor's music was published in Osaka. There were some 75 titles, and many of them, for example, Smolensky�?'s "Paschal Stichera", and Makarov�?'s "The Angel Cried", are still sung in many churches in Japan. 
The hard work of these early years came together in the singing at the re-consecration ceremony for the rebuilt Holy Resurrection Cathedral on December 15, 1929. Afterwards Metropolitan Sergius praised him: "Victor Alexandrovich Pokrovsky, a great choir director who has done hard work since 1924. His name will be kept in the history of music in Japan. Our choir are not only good singers but artistic and full of spirit." ("Tokyo Holy Resurrection Cathedral and the Earthquake", by Metr. Sergius.)

The Bad Old Days

"'The Bad Old Days" was the British entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978, performed in English by Co-Co. 
The song, written by Stephanie de Sykes and Stuart Slater was an uptempo love song, with the narrator recalling 'the bad old days' before they met their current partner. 
On the night of the final, 22 April, the song was performed eighth, following Spain's José Vélez with "Bailemos un vals" and preceding Switzerland's Carole Vinci with "Vivre". At the close of voting, it had received 61 points, placing 11th in a field of 20. At the time, this was the worst showing yet for the UK in Eurovision, surpassing the 9th place from 1966 which until 1978 had held the dubious distinction. "The Bad Old Days" held the ignominious title until 1987, when the UK finished 13th. Of all the UK entries submitted from 1975-1993, this was the only UK song that did not receive either a 12 or a 10 point score at least once in the voting sequence. The highest score awarded to The Bad Old Days was 8 points from Germany.
The single reached No.13 in the UK during a seven week chart run. The song entered the UK singles chart at no.39 for the week the contest was staged. In the following week, it rose rapidly to no.16. Its eventual peak of 13 occurred three weeks after their failure in the contest. It was to be the group's only hit.
"The Bad Old Days" was succeeded as the British representative at the 1979 contest by Black Lace with "Mary Ann".

Anna Valley

Anna Valley is a village in Hampshire, United Kingdom. The settlement is a suburb of Andover, and is located approximately south-west of the town centre.
The name 'Anna' derives from the Celtic river 'Anne' meaning 'Ash tree stream' now known as Pillhill Brook.
Tasker Waterloo Iron Works(Taskers of Andover) opened here in 1809 and survived as a manufacturing industry until final closure in 1984. The site is now a modern housing development though there are still signs of Tasker's influence in the village in the form of workmen's houses, a line of terraced houses built for the workers and the former Tasker's hall which is now private housing.
Originally much of the land occupied by the later foundry at the far end of the village was marsh land, known as Clatford Marsh. Robert Tasker noted the fact that the village had quarrying rights to chalk in the nearby hillside. By exploiting this right and quarrying an acre of chalk from the hillside it enabled the marshland to be filled with the quarried materials to act as foundations for the new Iron Foundry situated alongside the PillHill brook which would serve as a source of water power for the foundry. This chalk quarry is still very much in evidence though is now private property but can be seen from the road and a footpath that passes along the hillside behind the village leading to the Iron Age hillfort of Bury Hill.
On 20 November 1830 a mob of rioters came from Andover town, they smashed a bridge in Upper Clatford that carried the road over the river Anton and proceeded to vandalise and damage fixtures and equipment at the foundry. A number of arrests were made by a detachment of local Yeomanry and the Duke of Wellington Sir Arthur Wellesley sat on the board of assizes held at Winchester jail when the ringleaders were sentenced to be hanged and a number to be transported to Australia for their crimes.
In 1843 Tasker Ironworks installed a new cast iron bridge in Upper Clatford that exists today, carrying the road over the river Anton towards Church Lane. A later iron foot bridge was installed in Andover in 1851 to carry Ladies Walk over the new Micheldever Road that was cut through the chalk hillside.
The village once had 2 public houses, one situated at the bottom of Sam Whites hill, on the road to Upper Clatford, the hill so being named for a former landlord of the pub. A second public house stood almost opposite Tasker Ironworks.
On Wednesday July 13th 1910 an army airship, the Beta Airship, was flying over Andover when the crankshaft broke.The airship was landed at Little Park Farm and was later towed by Royal Engineers to the chalk pit opposite Tasker Waterloo Ironworks. A new engine was brought from Farnborough, Hampshire and repairs assisted by the Ironworks factory. Beta remained in the chalk pit all night and most of the following day.Crowds gathered to witness this novel site (see L. T. C. Rolt. Waterloo Iron Works (1968) (David and Charles)).
The village and post office shop was demolished in December 2013, having closed a few years earlier.

Klang Sentral

Klang Sentral is a commercial hub in the northern part of the royal town of Klang in Selangor, Malaysia. Developed by Titijaya Group's subsidiary of NPO Development, the RM300 million development is expected to take up of freehold land.
Klang Sentral is also the new controversial and highly-debated ultra-modern transport terminal for the local and intercity bus and taxi services in Klang. The RM40 million bus and taxi terminal which started to operate on 27 December 2008 is located nearby to the Setia Alam (part of Shah Alam) and Aman Perdana (part of Klang) townships. It is situated about 9 kilometers away from the Klang town centre.
History.
Klang Sentral was a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project between the developer and the Klang Municipal Council (MPK). The concession agreement was signed in January 2007 during the administration of the former Barisan Nasional state government in Selangor.
The project was planned by Selangor State Urban Planning Department (JPBD) for the development of Klang Town in the 1990s. The plan was taken seriously by Klang Municipal Council (MPK) when the former Klang bus and taxi terminal was burnt down by fire on 19 May 2003 and increasing traffic congestion in the town.
The developer of Klang Sentral had built the terminal and contribute the land to the state government, with total cost of RM 40million to the developer. For this reason, the developer was given a 30-year concession rights to operate the bus and taxi terminal after which the ownership of the terminal shall be given to MPK. It is one of the few project that is continued by the administration of Pakatan Rakyat state government in Selangor.
However, if MPK decides not to relocate the former Klang bus and taxi terminal (which is located right in the heart of the town centre) to Klang Sentral, MPK will have to pay a sum of RM13 million compensation charges to the developer.
Controversies.
Even though before the new bus and taxi terminal at Klang Sentral starts to operate, there have been a few controversies surrounding the project. The development itself is located at the far north end of Klang and is not within the vicinity of the Klang town centre. It is also located far away from the Klang Komuter station. Many passengers and bus operators have complained about the higher transportation costs and longer time spent to commute around.
Bus operators at Klang Sentral were being charged RM900 of rental fees per month compared with just RM150 at the old Klang bus terminal in the town centre. At the same time, buses are now charged RM10 per entry at Klang Sentral compared with just RM2 at the old station previously. Shops and stall traders at Klang Sentral have also complained about high rental charges. The single-way bus fare to Kuala Selangor from the former bus station was RM4 while the fare from Klang Sentral is RM5.30.
After clarification with Cityliner, the largest bus operator in Malaysia, it is confirmed that single-way bus fare to Kuala Selangor from former bus station is RM5.30, while it is only RM 4.30 from Klang Sentral. Cityliner reaffirmed that there shall be no additional cost passed to the consumer.
The Klang Consumer Association had been protesting against the relocation of the terminal to Klang Sentral since 2005. In addition to that, there are numerous industrial factories nearby, which is a cause for environmental concerns. Also, Klang Sentral is expected to increase the already bad major traffic congestion along Jalan Meru and Jalan Kapar, the two main artery roads in Klang.

Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks

Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks () is the second largest steel plant in Poland. It opened on July 22, 1954 in a newly built, easternmost district of Kraków called Nowa Huta. The steelworks as well as the district were located in the area formerly occupied by the village of Mogiła and surrounding farmland. 
During the Communist rule, the plant was called "Vladimir Lenin Steelworks". The name was changed in 1990, following the collapse of communism, and the factory was renamed to commemorate the scientist and engineer Tadeusz Sendzimir. In its heyday – in the 1970s – the plant employed around 40,000 people and annually produced almost 7 million tons of steel. In the 1980s, it was one of the most important centers of anticommunist resistance, with numerous strikes and street demonstrations taking place in Nowa Huta. 
In January 2005, the plant was purchased by the Mittal Steel Company and now it is owned by Arcelor-Mittal, the largest steelmaker in the world. Its current name is "ArcelorMittal Poland S.A. Oddział Kraków", but the name "Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks" is still commonly used.

The Kochersberg is a natural region of the French département of Bas-Rhin in Alsace and is a part of the hills found along the eastern side of the Vosges mountains. It gave its name to the Community of Communes of the Kochersberg.
Its name comes from the Kochersberg hill; its highest peak (301 m), stands over Neugartheim-Ittlenheim.
A castle was built on its top in the 13th century but was destroyed three centuries later. Its only relief is its peripheral ditch.
Between 1794 and 1797, a semaphore tower was built in its place. It was the second relay (after Dingsheim), of the optical telegraph line from Strasbourg to Paris via Saverne and its pass and was used until 1852.
This relay has been replaced in the late 20th century by a motionless memorial which can still be seen (weather permitting), from ten kilometers away.

Earlier on it would leave Bandra Terminus and after a halt at Borivali would go non stop until Hazrat Nizamuddin except for operational halts. Given the poor patronage to this train, the operational stops were changed to commercial stops. Thus, it now also halts at Vadodara (for engine change) and Kota Junction (for crew change). It has only 3 halts either way (excluding starting and ending stations).
As Western Railway has changed over to AC traction, Vadodara is now an operational halt. It is now hauled by a Vadodara based WAP 4E engine.

Life and career.
Payne was born in Atlanta with a natural talent and began dancing at the age 4. He began formal training at the age of 9 where he studied at Norma's Academy of Dance under the direction of the late Norma B. Mitchell and her daughter Djana Bell. In 1984, Payne went to Northside School of the Arts, and studied under the direction of William G Densmore and performed in Atlanta's Showbiz Kids. He then joined the Harrison Dance company under the direction of Gary Harrison before moving to Los Angeles where he soon met longtime personal idols Kenny Ortega, Michael Peters, Debbie Allen, and Paula Abdul.
Payne's big break came at the age of 19 after he created a dance video of himself which helped him land his first major gig as part of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 World Tour. From the moment he performed on stage, his talent for dancing was obvious and immediately started fielding offers to work with Prince, Debbie Allen, En Vogue, TLC, and Michael Jackson on his Dangerous World Tour. While working with Jackson extensively, Payne began to see the entire creative process close-up, and soon began to choreograph for such major acts as Madonna, Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Faith Hill, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Britney Spears, Usher Raymond IV and Beyoncé. Payne also choreographed the debut music video for Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls, and re-teamed with Scherzinger to provide the artistic direction for her critically acclaimed performances on both the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards and "So You Think You Can Dance". In 2008, Payne choreographed a tribute segment to Michael Jackson which included Omarion on the television series "Dancing with the Stars".
In May 2009, Payne started to work with Michael Jackson and Kenny Ortega on This Is It which was a sold-out series of fifty concerts by Jackson to be held at The O2 Arena in London. These were Jackson's first significant concert events since the HIStory World Tour in 1997 and had been cited as one of the year's most important musical events, with over one million people attending in total. Unfortunately, the concert series was canceled due to Jackson's untimely demise. On July 7, 2009, Payne helped choreograph the Michael Jackson memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles which was broadcast live around the world, from the U.S. to Slovakia to parts of Asia, with an estimated one billion viewers. Following the months after Jackson's passing, Payne worked very closely with Ortega to piece together rehearsal footage from Michael Jackson's This Is It which was put together from rough footage recorded at the Los Angeles Forum and the Staples Center. Subsequently, the film was released worldwide with a limited two-week theatrical run from October 28, to November 12, 2009. Tickets went on sale a month early on September 27, 2009, to satisfy a high anticipated demand; to date, the film has broken numerous records via tickets both pre-sale and sales worldwide.
In December 2009, Payne also choreographed Lady Gaga on the The Monster Ball Tour as well as provided direction for her performances on the 2009 American Music Awards, "The Jay Leno Show", and "Ellen". He also worked with Mariah Carey on her "H.A.T.E.U." video. To round out the year, he traveled to Japan to work with SMAP and choreograph a Michael Jackson Tribute which was aired on TV for the New Year's Eve special.
In January 2010, Payne embarked on a peace tour and arranged a surprise visit to the Cebu province of the Philippines to work with the CPDRC Dancing Inmates of the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC), a maximum security that is also featured in the Michael Jackson Opus. Famous for their "Thriller" which received 300,000 views per day at its peak, the video has received over 37 million reported views and is considered one of the most viral videos viewed on the internet. Payne along with "This Is It" dancers Daniel Celebre (aka Da FunkyMystic) and Dres Reid taught over 1500 dancing inmates to perform "The Drill" as part of the song "They Don't Care About Us" and was video taped to coincide with the "This Is It" DVD & Blu-ray release on January 25, 2010. The clip went live on YouTube, Yahoo and TMZ and immediately captured more than 3 million views within 1 week of its release online.
In April 2010, Payne was honored by The Michael Jackson Tribute Portrait, the largest Michael Jackson tribute in the world, endorsed by the Jackson Family Foundation. The tribute is an interactive work of art by artist David Ilan, which is made from one million hand drawn dots. Friends and family of Jackson's get a dot in their name in the area of Jackson's heart.
In October 2010, CBS announced that Payne would join Kimberly Wyatt and Executive producer, Lead Judge and Personal Idol Paula Abdul on the judges panel for her new dance competition and reality show "Live to Dance". CBS describes the series as broadcast television's first all-ages, all-genres dance series that is based on Sky 1's UK dance show "Got to Dance". The different acts will compete for a $500,000 prize in front of the panel of judges, and viewers will eventually get to vote for their favorite dancers during the semifinal and final rounds. "Live to Dance" kicks off with a two-hour special January 4 before moving to its regular hour-long slot Wednesdays, starting January 5.
Payne also choreographed for Hong Kong singer, Andy Lau along with Stacy Walker for the Andy Lau Unforgettable Concert 2010 throughout the year. In addition, he also worked with Han Geng to choreograph the singer's titletrack for his first solo album, along with four other dancers from "This Is It." When the album promotions arose, Payne performed with the singer and the dancers on various Chinese variety and talk shows as the opening.
In November 2010 Payne was seen on Michael Jackson's The Experience on Dance School.
Payne also worked with pop-singer Manika. He choreographed her live shows along with directing and choreographing her debut music video "Just Cant Let You Go" featuring Young Money's Lil Twist.
In 2013, Payne started work in Japan with the Johnny's Entertainment.

CFU-E

CFU-E is a colony forming unit.
It arises from CFU-GEMM 
Understanding the murine CFU-e assay (analogous to human assay):
CFU-e is a stage of erythroid development between the BFU-e stage and the pro-erythroblast stage. CFU-e colony assay is designed to detect how many colony-forming-units of erythroid lineage there are in a hematopoietic tissue (bone marrow, spleen, or fetal liver), which may be reflective of the organism’s demand for oxygen delivery to the tissues or a hematopoietic disorder.
Early erythroid progenitors are found at a quite low frequency relative to later stages of erythroid differentiation, such as the pro-erythroblast and the basophilic erythroblast stages which can be detected by flowcytometry directly ex-vivo (Socolovsky et al. 2001 PMID 11719363). Furthermore, unlike for the pro-erythroblast and later stages of erythroid development, no truly reliable and unique positive flow-cytometric markers exist, though it is possible to use negative exclusion markers to deplete a cell population of other precursors and differentiated cells by cell sorting, thus greatly enriching it for the CFU-e activity (Prospective isolation and global gene expression analysis of the erythrocyte colony-forming unit, Terszowski G. et al. Blood 2005). CFU-e cells express Epo receptor, c-Kit (Stem cell factor receptor), transferrin receptor (CD71+), and are Ter119(glycophorin-A associated antigen)-negative. For the above reasons, the CFU-e assay, as inefficient and variable as it can often be, is still in use today.
Cells at the CFU-e stage express some erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and thus can be induced to terminally differentiate in vitro in 2–3 days in the presence of only erythropoietin (Epo) (together with the basic contents of culture media: FBS, BSA in IMDM). Methylcellulose is a semisolid media additive that allows an investigator to stain (with diaminobenzidine reagent for hemoglobin) and then count individual colonies, each arising from a single plated progenitor that is at the CFU-e stage. By day 2 from the time of plating, each CFU-e colony will contain between 8 (minimum) and 64 hemoglobinized cells most of which are in their end-stage of erythroid differentiation. It is possible to see a small spectrum of hemoglobinization level and possibly cell size, indicating that some cells in the colony have achieved the end-stage faster than others.
Cell number in a colony is important because pro-erythroblast stage is also Epo-responsive (expresses Epo receptor), but the proliferative capacity of these cells is not as high, thus yielding a colony with fewer than 8 cells. Likewise, an earlier stage of erythroid differentiation may also yield colonies in Epo-only medium, but these colonies would likely be smaller and/or not hemoglobinized, since the stages before the CFU-e stage (MEP and BFU-e) require other factors (IL-3 etc.) and more time for growth that will also delay the terminal differentiation and hemoglobinization.
(via BFU-E, which stands for "erythroid burst-forming units") and gives rise to proerythroblasts.

Contemporaneous Article Extract.
""Played his earliest football with Thornes Lane Rovers and Thornes United, then at scrum half for Wakefield R.U. he gained Yorkshire County R.U. honours. His entry into Trinity's ranks came at a time when the highly successful half-back combination of Slater and Newbould was in full swing – but he proved himself a versatile player and when, for that famous Cup semi-final against Wigan, Trinity found themselves without a loose-forward, Herbert stepped into the breach. His fast and clever play plus deadly tackling made a handsome contribution to Trinity's victory. He played at loose forward in the Challenge Cup final v. Hull and that became his settled position. Not only that, but he went on the 1910 Tour as loose-forward and played in the Brisbane Test""

Midhurst Rother College

Midhurst Rother College is a mixed Academy for students aged 11 to 19, in Midhurst, West Sussex, in southern England. It was officially formed on 1 January 2009 following the closure of three predecessor schools in the area. It serves a wide rural area in the Rother Valley of West Sussex and is sponsored by one of the largest academy groups in the country, United Learning. The college also has partnerships with the University of Chichester and Winchester College.
Formation.
The academy was formed in January 2009. This followed the closure of three predecessor schools operating as part of a three-tier structure: Midhurst Grammar School, Midhurst Intermediate School and Petworth's Herbert Shiner School. The Grammar school - with a history dating back to 1672 - had accommodated students aged 13 to 19, while both intermediate schools had students aged 10 to 13.
The new school was introduced as part of the local authority's move towards two-tier provision. The school opened with students from Year Six to Year 13, but began to operate as a standard secondary from September 2009, with the youngest students being in Year Seven, aged 11.
Campus.
In September 2012, a new school building replaced the old on the River Site Campus at a cost of £31 million. Situated at the foot of the South Downs, the building is state of the art both in its architecture and the facilities it has to offer students, staff and the community of Midhurst. The facilities include a new school bus terminus, county-standard Astro Turf pitch, multi-use games area, Amphitheatre and extensive sports grounds. The formal opening ceremony, performed by Lord Andrew Adonis took place on 19 April 2013.  Lord Andrew Adonis, Minister of State for Education 2005-2008, was the original champion of the academy concept and was directly instrumental in the College’s early development.  During his speech he said “I am delighted to be opening MRC which is transforming education in its community. Its results last year were spectacular and attribute to its principal, governors and staff.” 
In a recent article written for the Academy Magazine by Lord Nash, Current Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools, he said about academy freedoms being at the heart of school improvement, “I have seen from my own experience that introducing strong performance management, professional development, coaching and reward can also make a huge difference …  Midhurst Rother College in West Sussex an example … has transformed management procedures since becoming an academy and has seen astonishing turnarounds in pupil performance." 
Curriculum.
The school operates joint specialisms in Science and Mathematics. In addition, the school identifies aspects of Business and Enterprise, and ICT throughout the curriculum.
Principal.
The first principal of the College is Dr Joe Vitagliano, former headteacher of Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School. Dr Vitagliano was formerly a pupil at the Midhurst Grammar School.
History.
The origins of Midhurst Rother College date back to 1672 when, founder of education in Midhurst, Gilbert Hannam, set up a free school for twelve poor Protestant boys.  The first classroom was in a loft, but later he moved the school to his own home which stood next door to the site on which the current College building is situated. Gilbert Hannam died on St. Patrick’s Day, 17 March 1677 having set out foundations and traditions which are still followed today. Each year, on the anniversary of his death, in accordance with his Will a service is held in the Midhurst Parish Church at which scholars pray for his soul.  During the service the member of clergy who delivers the sermon is presented by students with a fee of a pair of gloves. The tradition that the gloves ‘…are to the value of two shillings and sixpence and are presented in addition to a fee of twenty shillings…’

Dayton Daily News Building

The Dayton Daily News Building is a historic structure located at the corner of 4th and Ludlow Streets in Dayton, Ohio. It was designed by architect Albert Pretzinger for "Dayton Daily News" founder James M. Cox. According to Cox’s autobiography, he was turned down for a loan by a local banker who told him “Newspapers have never been known to earn money. Of course we can’t accommodate you.” After being turned down for a bank loan to start the paper, Cox asked Pretzinger to "build him a damn bank" so it was modeled after the Knickerbocker Trust building in New York City. Among the most significant components of the three-story building are those surrounding the entrance: three bays wide, the facade features a set of Corinthian columns, a set of fluted columns in the Doric order that form a grand frontispiece around the entrance, and a partial pediment with a cornice supported by cornucopiae. Its walls are built of a mixture of wood and granite.
The building was erected between 1908 and 1910 and expanded in the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. The 1908 building was remodeled in 1989. On November 30, 1978, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In April, 2007, the newspaper's editorial and business offices moved to the former NCR Building 31 at 1611 S. Main St. on Dayton's south side, near the University of Dayton campus.
The newer portions of the Dayton Daily News building will be demolished in 2013 and replaced by a five-story, 200-apartment student housing building in 2014. Only the 1908 building on the corner will remain. The Schwind Building at 27 Ludlow, built in 1913, was imploded on August 17, 2013 as part of the demolition process.

Italo Mus

Italo Mus (4 April 1892 – 15 May 1967) was an Italian impressionist painter.
Early years and family.
Italo Mus was born in Châtillon to parents from the Aosta Valley. His mother Martine Vallaise was from a noble family of Arnad; his father Eugène Mus was a sculptor from Torgnon. His earliest artistic training took place in his father's workshop where he learn woodcarving. In 1909, recommended by Lorenzo Delleani, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Turin and followed the course of painting and drawing. Here his teachers included Giacomo Grosso, Paolo Gaidano, Luigi Onetti and Marchisio: artists faithful to the impressionist tradition, and who taught him the basics of art.
In 1910, the International Center for the Fine Arts in Rome assembled some of the best known painters of the time, including Chagall, Raoul Dufy, Jean Cocteau and Picasso. This was the occasion when the young Mus first gained national recognition, being awarded first prize in the "Young Painters’ Salon".
Career.
Although very committed to his native Aosta Valley, Mus spent short periods in 1913 working on fresco and restoration projects: first in Lyon and then in Lausanne and in Friesch near Briga in the Swiss the canton of Valais. He took part in the First World War, and while on leave he met Giuseppina Crenna. After the end of the war they married and in due course had four children.
In 1932 Mus was responsible for the Saint-Vincent war memorial. The work, modelled in clay and then cast in bronze in Milan, was of an Alpino holding a weapon in his hand and with a fallen comrade across his knees. No trace of this monument remains: it was melted down in 1940 when its metal was needed for the war effort.
In 1938 the art critic Guido Marangoni saw Mus’s works in his studio and was impressed enough to write an article in the art journal "Perseo", describing him as a “highly talented painter.” For a time he worked in his studio at Saint-Vincent with Filippo De Pisis. In 1956 some of his paintings were shown in New York and Buenos Aires.
In the mid-1960s, while still active, he fell victim to a serious disease which prevented him from continuing to work. Italo Mus died in Saint-Vincent on 15 May 1967.
Work.
Mus created about two thousand works: drawings, sketches, and paintings of subjects. For most of his life he used oil on canvas or panel. His activity consists of three clearly defined periods.
Prizes.
His long and laborious work was rewarded by many prizes: the "Prix Saint-Vincent" (1922-1947-1949), the "Prix de la Montagne" (‘Prize of the Mountain’, Milan 1927), the "Premio Einaudi" (1950), the "Premio Consiglio dei Ministri" (‘Italian Cabinet Prize’, Rome 1959), and the "Premio Nazionale d'Arte Sacra" (‘National Award for Sacred Art’, Rome 1960).
In 1979 the director Gianpaolo Taddeini made a fictionalised version of Mus’s life, based on a text by Ugo Ronfani, for the RAI-Aosta Valley television station: "A valley, a Painter: Italo Mus".

Karl Nicolussi-Leck

Karl Nicolussi-Leck (14 March 1917 – 31 August 2008) was a Hauptsturmführer (Captain) in the Waffen-SS during World War II who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
Early life.
Karl Nicolussi-Leck was born on the 14 March 1917, in Vadena in South Tyrol (Italy). At school he read the works of Plato and studied Philosophy, Law and Political Science and played a leading role in the South Tyrolean Nazi organization Völkischer Kampfring Südtirol (VKS) (eng: Peoples Action Group).
World War II.
When War was declared Nicolussi-Leck volunteered to join the Waffen SS (SS number 423.876) on April 10, 1940. He was posted to the SS Standarte "Deutschland" in the SS-VT and after completing basic training was promoted to Rottenführer (Corporal).
By the time of Operation Marita the invasion of the Balkans he had been promoted to Scharführer (Staff Sergeant) and was awarded his first combat decoration the Wound Badge when he was wounded for the first time.
Nicolussi-Leck was transferred to the SS "Der Führer" Regiment, SS Division "Das Reich" for Operation Barbarossa the invasion of the Soviet Union and was seriously wounded in the advance towards Moscow.
In November 1941 he was selected to become an officer and posted to the SS-Junkerschule at Bad Tölz and promoted to Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) after graduation in April 1942. He was placed in command of a platoon in the 2nd Company, 5th SS Panzer Battalion, 5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking".
He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class during the Battle of Rostov and shortly after the 1st class award in the advance north of the Kuban River.
On the 15 October 1942, he was given command of the 1st Company, 5th SS Panzer Regiment after all the Company's officers had been killed or wounded in battle earlier that day.
Kovel encirclement.
Nicolussi-Leck was awarded the Knight's Cross during the Battle of Kovel, in the Pripet Marshes while in command of a Kampfgruppe of the II. Battalion, 5th SS Panzer Regiment, newly equipped with Panther tanks, along with the III. Battalion, SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment "Germania", newly equipped and up to strength, which had just arrived at the front from Germany.
Nicolussi-Leck immediately launched an attack with five Panthers. Soon after beginning the attack, he received a radio message from the besieged commander to halt his attack and withdraw. He ordered his radio operator to ignore the call, and continued his attack. Risking court-martial, he then proceeded to fight his way though the Soviet encirclement, destroying several Soviet tanks in the process. His Panther was the first vehicle to break the encirclement. After the relief force established a corridor to the encircled force, the withdrawal began. Unlike the previous encirclement at Korsun, the trapped force managed to escape with most of its equipment intact, and the division was ready for action immediately.
Post war.
After the war Karl Nicolussi-Leck helped many of his SS comrades leave Europe for South America. In 1948 he immigrated to Argentina, but he returned in the early 50's to the South Tyrol, where he worked as an entrepreneur for Mannesmann. 
He was the founder of the South Tyrolean Center for Education, the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Bolzano and the University Claudiana.
Karl Nicolussi-Leck died on the August 31st, 2008 in Bozen, South Tyrol.

Copenhagen Climate Council

The Copenhagen Climate Council is a global collaboration between international business and science founded by the leading independent think tank in Scandinavia, Monday Morning, based in Copenhagen. The councilors of the Copenhagen Climate Council have come together to create global awareness of the importance of the UN Climate Summit (COP15) in Copenhagen, December 2009, and to ensure technical and public support and assistance to global decision makers when agreeing on a new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol from 1997.
Organization.
The Copenhagen Climate Council was founded in 2007 by the leading independent think tank in Scandinavia, "Monday Morning", head-quartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Purpose.
The purpose of the Copenhagen Climate Council is to create global awareness of the importance of the UN Climate Summit (COP15) in Copenhagen, December 2009. Leading up to this pivotal UN meeting, the Copenhagen Climate Council works on presenting innovative yet achievable solutions to climate change, as well as assess what is required to make a new global treaty effective. The Council will seek to promote constructive dialogue between government and business, so that when the world's political leaders and negotiators meet in Copenhagen, they will do so armed with the very best arguments for establishing a treaty that can be supported by global business.
By promoting and demonstrating innovative, positive, and meaningful business leadership and ideas, the Copenhagen Climate Council aims to demonstrate that achieving an effective global climate treaty is not only possible, but necessary. The strategy is built upon the following principles:
Manifesto.
Published in November 2007, on the eve of the UN COP13 Climate Change Conference in Bali – the instigation night of the Bali Road Map. The document outlines what the Council believes is required to tackle climate change and how this can be achieved through a new global treaty. The Manifesto articulates a clear goal for the maximum level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2050. The document will serve as input at the "World Business Summit on Climate Change", outlining key elements for further discussion and inclusion in the recommendations to be delivered to the UN Summit.
Membership.
Copenhagen Climate Council comprises 30 global climate leaders representing "business", "science", and "public policy" from all parts of the world. 
The Councilors.
The "Councilors" [http://www.copenhagenclimatecouncil.com/about-us/councillors.html] to the Copenhagen Climate Council are:
Activities.
The central aim of the Copenhagen Climate Council is to create global awareness to the urgency of reaching a global agreement on how to tackle climate change at the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen, December 2009. To achieve this end, the Copenhagen Climate Council provides a Web 2.0 climate website – 'The Climate Community' – which features latest climate news, intelligence, solutions and points of view, an online climate community, as well as the rest of the Copenhagen Climate Council activities, such as the 'World Business Summit on Climate Change'; launching the 'Thought Leadership Series'; launching the 'Climate LIFE' film, book, and digital exhibition; co-hosting with CITRIS the scientific conference 'Unlocking the Climate Code: Innovation in Climate and Energy'; and the Poznan side event 'Business Requirements of a Post-2012 Climate Treaty'. Recently, the Copenhagen Climate Council has also hosted a Business Roundtable in Beijing.
The Climate Community.
The Climate Community is the official website of the Copenhagen Climate Council. The website is based on Web 2.0 principles, and hooks the user up with the worlds leading climate stakeholders and offers possibility for the user to give voice and influence the global climate agenda.

Exclusive news features so far include interviews with U.S. Energy Secretary Steve Chu, UN Climate Chief Yvo de Boer, the Danish Climate minister Connie Hedegaard, IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri, Professor Daniel Kammen, Lars Josefsson, CEO of Vattenfall. The Climate Community also features regular updates on the COP15 negotiation process and important upcoming events. The unique content on Community also includes selected and in-depth descriptions of innovative business solutions. 
A valuable feature on the Community is the Climate Intelligence Archive, which selects and list key international policies, research reports, government agencies, NGOs, inspiring media sources, and upcoming climate events.
The Climate Community also hosts an online Virtual Summit, which is an integral part of the World Business Summit on Climate Change to take place in May 2009. The Virtual Summit will facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, as well as be a testing ground for new ideas and partnerships through interactive web 2.0 tools.
World Business Summit on Climate Change.
The World Business Summit on Climate Change takes place six months prior to the pivotal UN climate change conference (COP15) in Copenhagen, December 2009. The summit brings together business chief executives with the world's top scientists, economists, civil society, media leaders, government representatives and other leading thinkers to put forward recommendations for the next international framework on climate change to replace the Kyoto Protocol after 2012. Among the prominent participants so far are Al Gore, Chairman of Generation Investment Management; Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark; and Sir Richard Branson, Founder and CEO of the Virgin Group.
At the summit, chief executives will discuss how business can help solve the climate crisis through innovative business models, new partnerships and the development of low carbon technologies. They will send a message to the negotiating governments on how to remove barriers and create incentives for implementation of new solutions in a post-Kyoto.
The results of the World Business Summit on Climate Change will be presented to the Danish government, host of COP15, and to world leaders negotiating the terms of the next international climate treaty.
Thought Leadership Series.
The Copenhagen Climate Council Thought Leadership Series on Climate Change is a publication that will be published in hardcopy and on the Copenhagen Climate Council Home Page in the lead up to the World Business Summit on Climate Change in May 2009. The Thought Leadership Series presents a collection of inspirational, concise and clearly argued pieces from some of the world's most renowned thinkers and business leaders on climate change. The objective of the pieces is to assist in enhancing the public and political awareness of the actions that could have a significant impact on global emissions growth and to disseminate the message that it is time to act hence a new UN climate treaty will be developed in December 2009.
The Thought Leadership Series is aimed at elucidating and creating awareness of the key elements in the business and policy response to the climate problem. The rationale for the Thought Leadership Series is firstly to change the focus from stating we have a problem to communicating the solutions to the problem, and secondly to show the potential and opportunities inherent in tackling climate change.
"The themes of the Thought Leadership series are:"
Climate LIFE.
Climate LIFE is a film, book and digital exhibition project initiated by the Copenhagen Climate Council. Climate LIFE is intended to be “a virtual tour of how communities across the globe can both fight climate change and adapt to a warming world”. The purpose of Climate LIFE is to encourage awareness of and appreciation for the human and commercial potential in a low carbon future. The Copenhagen Climate Council With hopes for "Climate LIFE" to act as a catalyst for a new public discourse on climate change.
FILM : “Climate LIFE - the 5th revolution”.
"Climate LIFE - the 5th revolution" is an “emotional and strong story” of a journey across the world in search of the solutions so urgently needed for avoiding a world climate life gone a wreck. It is produced in the realisation that we need a new climate agenda in order to achieve a transition to a sustainable society. The Copenhagen Climate Council has stated it is “necessary” to tell the story of climate change using a new positive language that can appeal to new audiences. Particularly, the Copenhagen Climate Council wishes to use “evocative and emotional storytelling” to get behind the real motivations, which has made pioneers, community leaders and others act on climate changes. Through compelling and evocative story-telling, the audiences will themselves feel the urgency of the quest and be inspired to take action.
Climate LIFE will be a follow-up to Al Gore's 'An inconvenient truth'. Where Al Gore opened the world's eyes to the massiveness of climate change, Climate LIFE intends to tell the new convenient truth of climate change - that the knowledge and solutions we know today give us the opportunity to create communities that enhance quality of life; that it is possible to build a greener, safer and more sustainable Earth.
"Climate Life - the 5th revolution" aims to show that the precondition for the success is already present. A short feature will be launched at the World Business Summit on Climate Change and subsequently it will be shown at events, on the web, and will also be distributed to TV broadcasters across the world.
The film is produced in collaboration with Koncern Film and TV.
The LIFE Digital exhibition.
The "LIFE digital Exhibition" is intended to demonstrate what makes Climate LIFE possible. When launched on the web, it will explore the delivery model necessary to achieve the vision of Climate LIFE. Looking at the political, economic and cultural systems as well as the technological and biological process that will underpin low carbon living in the future, the exhibition will present a variety of practical solutions and their implications, highlighting the state of the art in movement, energy production and efficient consumption, water and waste management etc. The exhibition aims to use the latest social software advances and interactive tools to illustrate the challenges, how they affect people, and the possibilities for getting involved.
Unlocking the Climate Code: Innovation in Climate and Energy.
On June 19, 2008, Copenhagen Climate Council and Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) co-hosted an energy conference named Unlocking the Climate Code: Innovation in Climate and Energy. The aim of the conference was to identify the critical research and development achievements necessary for a successful transition to a low carbon economy. Conference participants will present and debate relevant policy and business models that can support technology innovation in carbon emissions reduction.
In an effort to create models of the relationships in business, policy, and technology to help guide innovative and rational decision making at the 2009 UN Summit, a suite of tools was developed, better known as the Climate Navigator.
According to Gary Baldwin, Director of Special Projects at CITRIS, the Climate Navigator will have several interrelated parts and functions. It will serve as an Internet-based community forum for researchers, policy makers, and business leaders, allowing politicians and others to direct questions to experts or open on-line discussions about specific proposals. It will also be a digital library, organizing the growing base of knowledge about how business models and policy can influence technology. In addition, the Navigator will employ new technology itself, including computer modeling applications developed by Dan Kammen's lab at Berkeley.
Business Requirements of a Post-2012 Climate Treaty.
On December 8, 2008, the Copenhagen Climate Council hosted an official side event at the UN COP14 Summit on Climate Change in Poznan, Poland from December 1–10, 2008. The theme was Business Requirements to a Post-2012 Climate Treaty. At the event, Council representatives from business and science presented their key principles for a new treaty. The thoughts presented at the event will feed into the development of the final recommendations delivered by international business leaders at the "World Business Summit on Climate Change", to be held in Copenhagen in May, 2009.

On November 11, 2008, the Copenhagen Climate Council hosted a roundtable meeting with some of the most prominent business leaders in China and the Danish Minister for Climate and Energy Connie Hedegaard. According to the Copenhagen Climate Council, conclusion of the summit was clear: “Climate change is becoming an important issue for Chinese CEOs, and opportunities in energy-efficient products and renewable energy are a driver for change.”
"Chinese business leaders recognize that sustainable development is a corporate responsibility, and that the need for creating economic growth in China should meet the needs of sound environment protection. I encourage all industries to respond and to collaborate – hand in hand – on tackling the challenge. I want to make sure that our children can live on a beautiful planet with blue sky and clean air.

Muffed Old English Game

The Muffed Old English Game fowl is a direct descendant of the jungle fowl "Gallus bankiva" or red jungle fowl, imported into England during the spice trade era of early European navigation.
These imported fowl were the originators of many breeds and the Muffed Old English Game fowl is probably one of the earliest of these varieties. Its color is variable, it does not have a great deal of set definitions and is not standardized by the American Poultry Association. As it is such an old breed, many local varieties have developed across the globe. There are English versions, Latin versions and American versions which may not locally fit with any definite groups of poultry and may therefore be regarded simply as chickens.
Characteristics.
The characteristic which most distinguishes this breed from others is that its cheeks are muffed or bearded, making it a most handsome bird. It is very hardy, possibly owing to its jungle fowl heritage, and noted for being thrifty; it broods eggs wonderfully, is able to care for itself in the most primitive conditions by eating insects, grasses, weed seeds and worms, whilst all the while raising a brood of chicks in a most protective manner.
Coloration is similar to the Kraienköppe or Twentse breed, as all the jungle fowl displayed colorful shades of red with silver duckwing plumage. The hens can have a pheasant-like plumage in a beautiful tan. In size, they are a medium build and are sometimes classified alongside the "bantams", although a Muffed Old English Game fowl is much larger than a 20 ounce bantam; it is of the type Leghorn, with 6 pound roosters and 4 pound hens. The hens lay very well, with a seasonal variation, and produce a nice cream–colored egg of a small (21 ounce) size.

4th Wall Theatre, Inc.

4th Wall Theatre, Inc. (aka 4th Wall Musical Theatre) is a non-equity theatre company in residence at the Westminster Arts Center on the campus of Bloomfield College, in Bloomfield, New Jersey, approximately 10 miles from Manhattan. 4th Wall is a qualified organization of the New Jersey Cultural Trust. Gwen Ricks-Spencer currently serves as the Executive Director, while Kate Swan is the Artistic Director. The group derived its name from the theatre term the fourth wall coined by Denis Diderot which describes it as “the imaginary wall at the front of the stage in a proscenium, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play”.
Mission.
The group's mission states that "4th Wall Theatre sets the highest standards of excellence in producing diverse, seldom-performed and original productions, celebrating a wide spectrum of visions and voices in theatre. 4th Wall is committed to breaking through the wall of imagination, to make cutting edge works accessible and fostering a positive theatre experience for our artists and audience." In addition, the company strives to 1) produce work by celebrated artists as well as emerging artists; 2) enlist and nurture the talents of respected artistic associates; 3) encourage public interest and participation in the musical theatre form both at 4th Wall and elsewhere; and 4) help to develop diverse audiences to appreciate theatre and participate in the creative process.
The 2012-2013 seasons includes: "Next to Normal", "", and "Lucky Stiff".
History.
Friends, who all worked as performers or artistic staff members at the Montclair Operetta Club in Montclair, NJ, conceived the idea of the non-profit 4th Wall Musical Theatre in 1996. The original founding members included Mark Frawley and Deborah Martin (Artistic Directors) with original board members, Richard Colonna, Lisa Hughes, Kathi Iannacone, Ed Kamholz, Nancy Marino, Gwen Ricks-Spencer, along with Charles Alexander Hay and Beth Vecchio. The group wanted to do smaller, lesser known musicals which focused more on ensemble work, rather than serving as a “star” vehicle for a performer. The group was incorporated in 1997 and began work its first fundraising production "Star Dust: A Tribute to the Music of the 1940s". This was followed by production of the group's first full length show, the musical "Working", based on Studs Terkels’ book of the same name with music by a variety of artists including Stephen Schwartz, James Taylor and Micki Grant to name a few. During 4th Wall's early years, the group continued to fine tune its mission and saw both audience growth and critical recognition for its presentations of musicals such as "Pippin", "Is there life after high school?", "Godspell", "Falsettos", "Violet" and "A New Brain" in addition to many others. The group produced at the Morristown-Beard School in Morristown, NJ. 
In 2002, 4th Wall was asked by the Bickford Theatre, located in the Morris Museum, to begin producing in its state-of-the-art theatre space. 4th Wall moved and presented musicals such as "Songs for a New World", "Hair", "Dames at Sea" and "La Cage aux Folles".
In the ensuing years, 4th Wall shifted its focus from ensemble pieces to producing lesser known and/or seldom produced musicals. Productions included "" , "Big River", "Ain’t Misbehavin’", "Kiss of the Spider Woman", and "Assassins". In the winter of 2006, the group made its current move to be the theatre in residence at the Westminster Arts Center on the campus of Bloomfield. In 2007, 4th Wall began offering stipends to its actors.
The group is driven by executive staff members and the board of directors: Gwen Ricks-Spencer-Executive Director, Kate Swan-Artistic Director, Bruce McCandless-Business Manager, Martha Thalheimer-Company Manager, Matt Burns, Kathi Iannacone, Paul Puccio and Jasmine Pai. 4th Wall staff and performers come to the theatre with credits from Broadway, Off-Broadway, National and European tours, Regional Theatre and Television. Many aspiring performers have worked with the group and moved on to these arenas as well.
M.I.D. (Musicals-in-Development) Stage Series.
Since moving to Westminster, 4th Wall has expanded its mission and season. Under the leadership of former Artistic Director Gregory Allen, the group launched the M.I.D. Stage Series in 2006. The program is designed to present new musical theatre works from emerging composers and writers. The staff and the cast work with the writers throughout the production process (from auditions to production). The show is then mounted in a bare bones production and talk back sessions with the audience conclude each evening's performance. The goal is to create a forum where new and emerging artists can have their work presented in a supportive environment, outside the intense glare of New York as an important and critical development step for the work. The hope is that one day these works will become the main stage productions for other theatres.
Off the Wall Stage Series.
In 2007, 4th Wall rolled out its Off the Wall Series which is dedicated to taking 4th Wall's mission of producing lesser known works to a new level. Off the Wall showcases more avant-garde and lesser known musical works. In addition, the group has added plays to its schedule with this series.
Educational programs.
4th Wall has developed a partnership with the New Jersey School of Dramatic Arts (“NJSDA”) which serves as the educational wing of our theatre. NJSDA is a comprehensive theater arts training program for the beginning actor to the working professional. Classes are available at all levels for Adults, Teens, and Children and are taught by industry professionals from Theater, TV, and Film. NJSDA offers theater arts training designed in a step by step program which builds on the skills gained in previous levels. NJSDA emphasizes the development of a strong and proven technique. 
As a partner organization, NJSDA students have the opportunity to intern with 4th Wall and receive specially priced rush tickets to 4th Wall performances. In addition, students are encouraged to audition for 4th Wall.

This Is (An Entertainment)

This Is (An Entertainment) is a play by Tennessee Williams. Similar in plot to that of "Idiot's Delight" by Robert E. Sherwood, it focuses on a hedonistic countess, the wife of a wealthy manufacturer of ammunition, who arrives at an elegant resort hotel in the midst of a war-torn Central European country in search of sexual misadventures. She achieves her goal with the help of a handsome blond chauffeur and his look-alike, a leader of the revolution.
Williams described the play as a first draft in need of polishing when the American Conservatory Theater staged it at the Geary Theater in San Francisco in 1976. The cast included Elizabeth Huddle as the countess, Nicholas Cortland in the dual roles of the chauffer and revolutionary, and Ray Reinhardt as the count.
Stanley Eichelbaum of the "San Francisco Examiner" called it "a boisterous vaudeville-like farce done in the free-wheeling style of the playwright's earlier "Camino Real". Though it is shot through with crude and raunchy humor, it evokes an old-world decadence, like the comic fantasies of Jean Anouilh." He added, ""This Is" is anything but a subtle play. Williams has subverted his lyrical gift with cheap and dreary vulgar humor, with painfully witless jokes . . . More surprising, perhaps, is the one-dimensional flatness of the characters."

Istanbul Chamber of Commerce

The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ICOC) is an institution that organizes and records the commercial transactions of individuals and commercial institutions located in Istanbul; in addition the ICOC also keeps records for these companies. The activities of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce are for the most part carried out in the central building, located in Eminönü.
In elections held in March, 2005, Dr. Murat Yalçıntaş was elected to the post of president of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.
History.
Establishment.
As part of their concern for the commercial and industrial problems of the 19th century, the Ottoman State desired to bring together the representatives of the industrial sector into one institution. To this end, the Trade and Agricultural Council, which had been established in 1876, was very productive. Subsequently, Mehmed Said Pasha (1838–1914), who had been appointed as grand vizier (prime minister) in 1879, put a start to the processes that were necessary for the establishment of trade, industry and agricultural guilds.
Acting upon Said Pasha’s directive, a draft charter consisting of 11 articles was prepared for the establishment of a chamber of commerce that would be similar to those in Europe, particularly the French examples. This draft was accepted by the Council of Ministers (Meclis-i Mahsus) on 18 January 1880. The Council of Ministers ruled that the chamber was to be referred to as the Ticaret Odası and quoted the decision in the text of the charter as follows: 
“The establishment of a Ticaret Odası in Istanbul by the Meclis-i Mahsus has been ratified by Abdul Hamid II II on 19 January 1880. Thus, for the first time in the Ottoman territory the process concerned with the establishment of a local chamber of commerce has been completed. The stage to proceed to next will be the completion of the organizational processes and the start of the activities of the Dersaadet (Istanbul) Ticaret Odası.”
The Establishment Charter of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.
The administrative structure of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası was very different from that of a modern chamber of commerce. While modern chambers have separate committees to carry out executive and supervisory functions, all the functions of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası were carried out by one institution. According to the first regulations of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, 24 members formed the chamber council. In order to be a member of the council, one had to be at least 30 years of age, have dealt with trade for at least 5 years, not have been implicated in any felony or murder, nor have committed any shameful crime that damaged one’s reputation or honor or to have been bankrupted; if the candidate had gone bankrupt, then they should have been able to regain their honor and name before becoming a member. The members of the council were selected by a majority secret ballot; if the votes were tied, the elder candidate would be selected. It was forbidden for two members to be selected from the same company. 
The members were selected by a twenty-person election committee, headed up by the minister of trade and agriculture; half of the commission was appointed by the minister, the other half by merchants. A majority vote among the members of the chamber would select a president and a vice-president, who would be ratified by the Ministry of Trade. The members of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası were elected for three years; that is, every year one-third of the members were newly appointed. If a member did not participate in the meetings for a period of six months without stating a good reason, they were considered to have resigned. 
The Dersaadet Ticaret Odası would act on its own initiative or would be instructed in how to act by the Ministry of Trade when applied to, thus providing opportunities for the advancement of trade; this included functions like taking the necessary measures to develop trade and industry, carrying out changes required in trade functions, customs duties, the construction of ports, the functioning of steam boats in the rivers, post offices and telegraphs, railway construction, repairs of roads and bridges, the establishment of stock markets, and the publication of trade newspapers. 
The internal regulations were prepared immediately after the establishment of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası and were presented to the Ministry of Trade for its approval. In this charter, the status of the Ticaret Odası was organized according to the total sovereignty of the state; this remained the status, without any serious change, until 1950.
The First Internal Charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası.
A “preparatory committee” headed up by Azaryan Efendi, which was known as the Cemıyet-i Ticariye (Trade Council), was established to prepare internal regulations. An “interim-institute” started to function with an official ceremony in April 1880; this body continued to operate until 14 January 1882. The organization of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası had been prepared by this same date. At the moment that the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası started to operate officially the Cemiyet-i Ticariye ceased to function; that is, the Cemiyet became the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası on 14 January 1882. The Cemiyet-i Ticaret met ten times until it was transformed into the Ticaret Odası, meeting to discuss the regulations of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, which had been prepared by the commission. The members were informed that the charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası had been approved by the ministry and the charter went into execution on 27 December 1881. 
The internal charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, dated 16 August 1881 was organized in a detailed way, setting out the function of the duties and authorities of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası. The internal charter, which consisted of six main sections, included many articles concerned with the aim and duties of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, the method of convening, the duties of the president, the functioning of the Ticaret Odası and its procedures, the duties of the merchants, the position of the head secretary and officials, as well as with the income of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası.
The Seal of the Chamber.
According to the internal charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, the Ticaret Odası had its own seal. On the top part of this seal was a “Crescent Moon and Star” symbol, while in the middle was inscribed: Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, surrounded by the French phrase Chambre de Commerce de Constantinople. All the documents that were dealt with in the Chamber of Commerce were to be stamped with this seal.
Opening Ceremony of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası.
The members of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, who were summoned after the ratification of the internal charter, took the decision to carry out an official opening of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası; it was decided that the first meeting was to be held on 14 January 1882. Before the opening of the Chambers of the Commerce, 200 lira was loaned to the Cemiyet’s accountant Benzona Efendi by Azaryan Efendi, who was the chief of the Cemiyet at that date, to spend on fittings and office supplies. 
Some time later the members of the Ticaret Odası were convened again and it was decided that the opening ceremony of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, which was to go into operation on 14 January 1882, would be held in its own building and that this should be in a neighborhood that would be easy for tradesmen to reach. Upon this, the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası went into operation in flat No. 12, a property belonging to Mehmed Ali Pasha which was located on the shores of the Golden Horn. It was seen to be suitable that the opening ceremony be held in the same location.
The Dersaadet Ticaret Odası was opened with a simple ceremony in the Mehmed Ali Pasha Han (Business Quarters). At the opening, the minister of trade and agriculture, Raif Efendi, was present and made a speech.
Structure.
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce consists of two main structures, one established by election and one by appointment. The organs that are formed by election are the Meslek Komiteler (Professional Committees), Oda Meclisi (Chamber Assembly), Yönetim Kurulu (Board of Directors) and the Disiplin Kurulu (Disciplinary Board). The organs that are established by appointment are the Genel Sekreterlik (General Secretarat) and the Şube Müdürlük (Branch Directorate). There are 257 council members and 347 committee members who are appointed as results of elections held every four years; this makes up the structure of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.
Professional Committees.
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is one of the largest chambers of commerce in the world, with a registered membership of 350,000. The Professional Committees of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce consists of approximately 90 elected Professional Committees. These committees are categorized according to NACE codes and are determined by the number of companies active in the related sector.
Projects.
Istanbul Commerce University.
The Istanbul Commerce University was established by the ICOC Waqf and started to offer education in the 2001-2002 academic year; the president of the university is Dr. Sabri Orman, while the head of the board of trustees is Erhan Erken, a member of the ICOC Council. The university has started to provide education in its own buildings in Küçükyalı, which were purchased in 2007, in addition to its quarters in Üsküdar. 
3,860 students are pursuing undergraduate degrees while 412 students are completing post graduate courses. The Istanbul Commerce University consists of 5 faculties, an English preparatory department, and one vocational high school, 3 institutes (social sciences – science and engineering – foreign trade), 2 centers (the EU application and research center and the continuous training center) and 1 unit (the IT security application and research unit).
Primary and Secondary Education Projects.
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has introduced 14 schools to the Turkish educational world; from the beginning of 2010 there are 4 vocational schools, an autistic children’s educational center, 8 primary schools - one in Lice, Diyarbakır and the others in Istanbul - and one multi-program high school.
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has also built 13 schools, one in Istanbul and 12 in different regions of Anatolia, in commemoration of Turkish martyrs. These schools are listed below:

The Teknopark Istanbul Project.
The Teknopark Istanbul Project has been led by the Permanent Undersecretariat of the Defense Industry, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, Airport Management and Aeronautical Industries A.Ş., Istanbul Commerce University, and Defense Technology Engineering and Commercial AŞ; as part of the scope of the project these institutions have provided direct support for the establishment of Teknopark Istanbul A.Ş. With the contract signed by the partners on March 12, 2010, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has become one of the founding partners of the project.
ITO-SSM Teknopark will be established on land that is part of the Advanced Technology Industry Park (İTEP), which is the property of the National Defense Ministry; this land makes up part of Sabiha Gökçen Airport. The most important characteristic of the Teknopark Istanbul Complex is that it will be established upon a structure that is formed from the public and private sectors and a university. The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce will set aside a budget of 50 million TL, and the park will be brought to life in an area measuring 5,000 square meters. In addition, a research center will be constructed. Teknopark Istanbul will, as part of its mission, work on advanced technology, including defense, space and aeronautics, biotechnology, nanotechnology and naval technologies.
The ÖZİMEK Project.
In 2007 the Mesleki ve Teknik Eğitim Kursları (Vocational and Technical Training Courses) Project, ÖZİMEK, which has been brought into life as a joint venture by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ICOC), the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration and the Istanbul Regional Board of Education, is seen as being the largest career-training program in the Turkish Republic. The aim of the project is to protect, increase and develop employment, to help reduce unemployment by benefiting from trade and vocational training schools and institutions, and to provide vocational development, change and training to prepare officials or those still working in the sector so that they will be able to be employed in keeping with new technology and developments.
The İş-Kur project was included in later stages of the project. The first aim was to develop a project that would provide 500 students with certificates at 15 trade high schools, in 44 different branches; at the present time, three large institutions in Istanbul, which has a great need in this area, have provided 10,000 courses in 70 vocational schools, in 82 separate branches, producing 6,500 graduates. By 2011 the project will have trained 30,000 people.
As part of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, the website: “Human Resources Market” has been established for the graduates of these courses. Those who have graduated can register their resumes on this site and thus when seeking employees, employers will be able to give priority to those who have graduated from certified courses.
e-ICOC.
In 2006, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce began an e-ICOC project which enabled members to complete ICOC procedures online, including patents, archiving, documents and forms. The system has been integrated with the systems of other institutions with whom the Chamber of Commerce works, including notaries, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB), Bağ-Kur, the governor's office and the city councils. With the implementation of this project, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has aimed to minimize internal bureaucracy and make tracking documents easier, thus creating an efficient and paperless office.
Formula One (Istanbul Park).
The expansion of the Formula 1 Grand Prix into Turkey was initiated by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. The Formula 1 facilities in Istanbul were successfully completed in 2005 when the first races were held. ICOC's partner TOBB, as well as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and the Special Provincial Administration aided in the completion of the facilities. After the first two races, the operation of the Istanbul Formula 1 Grand Prix was privatized and transferred to a third party.
Gulf Development.
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has paid visits to the Gulf Region in order to benefit from the capital accumulation resulting from the increase in oil output. A large delegation, including many representatives from the construction sector, participated in the visits which were organized to Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As a result of the meetings with both the private sector and government officials, Turkish contractors have undertaken many important construction projects in this region. Furthermore, these meetings have yielded an increase in Gulf investments in Turkey. These visits and meetings have brought about extremely productive results both for Turkish investments in the Gulf countries, as well as for the Gulf countries' investments in Turkey.
The Start-Exporting Program.
In 2010, 140 Istanbul Chamber of Commerce members benefited from the Start-Exporting program. This project, this first of its type in Turkey, is held throughout the country and has to date trained organizations in many provincial chambers of commerce. Between January 12 and May 12, 2010, the Start-Exporting program, which was developed in collaboration with the Madrid Chamber of Commerce and Industry, reached the sixth step.
The First Step in the U.S. Market Project.
In 2007, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCHAMBERS) launched the first step in the U.S. Market project. The project aims to improve trade relations between Turkey and the United States and to ensure the access of Turkish firms to the world's largest market. After Doing Business seminars were organized in Istanbul and the United States, a comprehensive educational website on the two markets went into operation.
The Istanbul Investment and Trade Office has been opened in New York. The Istanbul office, one of the many offices that have been opened in various financial centers, was opened in the Istanbul World Trade Center, hosted by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce on October 4, 2010.

Dorthe Skappel

Dorthe Skappel (born December 18, 1962) is a Norwegian television personality, journalist, celebutante and former model, probably best known for hosting "God kveld, Norge!" and "Gullruten" on TV2.
Personal life.
Born Anna Dorothea Riseng, Skappel was active on stage and in theatrical work in her early teens. During the 1980s, Skappel began working as an international model in Paris, before eventually returning to Oslo and marrying her high-school boyfriend Jon Skappel, a construction engineer. She has two daughters and is currently residing with her family in Ekeberg in Oslo.
Career.
In the early 1990s, Skappel joined the Norwegian television channel TVNorge as an entertainer and television host, before switching to TV2, and began her career by heading the Norwegian celebrity and entertainment program "God kveld, Norge!" non-stop for ten years since 1997. Since hosting the show, she has raised controversy for kissing Lene Nystrøm Rasted, the lead vocalist in the pop-dance group Aqua, and having her breasts felt by Robbie Williams during an interview on the air in Bergen, Norway. Since 1999, she has also hosted the annual award-show "Gullruten" for the Norwegian TV business. 
In 2007, Skappel was contracted to star in the Norwegian version of "Dancing with the Stars", except it included dancing on ice skates and it was called "Isdans", Norwegian for "Ice dance". She received critical acclaim for her performances, but on May 4 Skappel had an accident when she fell with her head in the ice while training with her partner. She was hospitalized with minor injuries and received bruises across her face, but has since recovered from the accident. Eventually, Skappel finished in fourth place. In 2008, Skappel sparked both fame and controversy when she recorded her first music video, in which she is seen rapping and "cursing" towards known Norwegian celebrities, and even her own television network, as the video was entitled "Fuck TV2". The song then became huge a hit, as it entered the official top 20-list at "VG" within the first week. However, the video itself was censored by TV2 and subsequently uploaded on Youtube onto various channels, where they have altogether garned about 100,000 viewers. Although Skappel raised controversy over the video, most fans, including most of the celebrities who were "cursed" at, applauded her rapping. Later that year, Skappel interviewed Gerard Butler regarding the release of "RocknRolla", a film written and directed by Guy Ritchie. Since Alexander Rybak won the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, Skappel has expressed interest in presenting the next contest ceremony, which will be held in Norway in 2010.
In the media.
As a result of her career, Dorthe Skappel's personal life has been and is still the subject of much media attention, criticism and controversy. In Norway, Skappel is considered one of the most recognizable celebrities on television and thus she is widely marketed in promotions and commercials on TV2. This is due to her high-profiled status as a Norwegian socialite and sex symbol. Additionally, Norwegian paparazzi has linked Skappel romantically with international celebrities such as Robbie Williams and Gerard Butler while Skappel has repeatedly denied this, describing these relationships as "ridiculous". Two common themes in Norwegian "gossip magazines" are Skappel's height and breast measurements.
Since 2006 Skappel, along with fellow Norwegian entertainers Tone Damli Aaberge, Pia Tjelta and Mia Gundersen, has fought an ongoing legal battle concerning an online pornography web site, which illegally contains nude photos and images of Skappel, Aaberge and Gundersen among others. The publishing of the images on the web site attracted widespread media attention, but Skappel has since claimed these to be fake and manipulated through digital technology. The site was reportedly operated by Bjørn-Endre Andersen, in addition to a number of similar web pages being operated in his name both domestically and abroad, but thus far neither the Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime ("Økokrim") or the National Criminal Investigation Service, have concluded a successful investigation, citing the lack of evidence.
The pornography scandal was widely covered in "Verdens Gang", "Dagbladet" and "Aftenposten", three prominent newspapers in Norway, and included nude photos of dozens of high-profiled celebrities. Skappel has not been successful in removing the images from the website, and continues to claim they are digitally manipulated.
In October 2009, Skappel announced she would publish a children's novel and become a writer. This coordinated with her 23-year-old daughter Maria Skappel announcing her pregnancy.
On January 5, 2010, TV 2 reported that Maria Skappel gave birth to a daughter, culminating in Dorthe Skappel becoming a grandmother at the age of 47.

Amra Kalan

Amra Kalan is a village and union council of Gujrat District, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is part of Kharian Tehsil and is located at 32°40'0N 73°40'0E with an altitude of 219 metres.
History.
Amra Kalan was named after its first settler Amra Khan in 16th century. The Battle of Chillianwala was fought during the Second Anglo-Sikh War in the nearby villages of Chillianwala and Rasul on 13 January 1849. Before the creation of Pakistan it was home to Muslims and Sikhs. During the bloody partition in 1947, Sikhs migrated to India and Muslim refugees (Muhajirs) from India were given the abandoned properties left behind by the Sikhs.
Before 1960 people of Amra Kalan largerly depended on agriculture. Small land holdings and economic conditions forced people to look for alternatives. From early 1960s, many inhabitants started migrating to European countries; mainly the United Kingdom, Greece, Holland, Denmark and Norway, to the Middle East in the 70s and later to USA, Spain and Italy from 90s onward. This has brought about an improvement in the economic conditions for majority of the population with better living conditions for many in the village.
Infrastructure.
Amra Kalan is in two parts: the main village and the Adda (bus stop). Over the years the Adda has developed into a place of commercial and industrial activity. Amra Kalan is growing into a small town: It has three government schools, hospital, a telephone exchange, a bank, a post office, two graveyards and two self-funded community centres.
The streets are paved and sewerage channels are open but lined. The village is surrounded by fields that are used to harvest rice and wheat in respective seasons.
Transport.
Amra Kalan has seventy Rickshaws providing convenient transport to neighbouring villages and to Dinga Town that is approximately 3 miles from the village. There are some tangas (single horse carriages) linking the village and the Adda but their number is on the decline. The Adda provides two taxi bases.
Religion.
The village is home to sunni, sufi and shia Muslims. There are eleven mosques, four holy shrines and one imam bargah.
in Amra Kalan there is a lovely holy shrine of hazrat Allah Din Sarkar R.A and his son hazrat peer Azim ur Rehman R.A great sufi saints

<doc id="20893158" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20893158" title="Werewolves of London (video game)">
Werewolves of London (video game)

Werewolves of London is a home computer video game released in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and the Amstrad CPC. It was released on cassette which has the Amstrad version on one side and the Spectrum version on the other (called 'Flippy Flippy'). The game used the same engine as Viz Design's (consisting of Steve Howard and Paul Smith) other game 'Frankenstein Junior' which was released by Codemasters in the same year. The game was released two years late (and largely unfinished) and was as a budget title, as intended publisher Ariolasoft went bankrupt (being released by Mastertronic. It was also release in Spain by Dro Soft.
The game was set in London, and the plot is to kill each of 8 members of an aristocratic family who put a curse on you, resulting in a daily transformation into a Werewolf. The title is possibly a reference to the Warren Zevon song "Werewolves of London".
Gameplay.
The game is played from a side-on 45-degree view, letting the player not only move left and right, but up and down. The character can also jump. The player starts off as a human who must roam the streets of London (including the London Underground and Hyde Park), and pick up items which will help the player in certain tasks. When the timer hits midnight, the player character transforms into a Werewolf. The player must then track down each of the 8 enemy characters and kill, and optionally, eat their bodies, while avoiding being shot or captured by the police.
The game involved more strategy elements than the traditional 8-bit 'platform' game, as the game changed difficulty in response to the player's actions. For example, the more people that are attacked by the werewolf, the more active the police become. The Hyde Park location is locked during the night, and a ticket is needed to enter the subway (although you can leap over the gate). When the Werewolf is 'touched' by a police officer with handcuffs you are put in prison (though how an unarmed police officer can overpower a werewolf is not addressed). You are released when the player transforms back to a human character, but can escape by finding a crowbar to escape through the sewers (a torch is needed to see in the dark). Eating family members and NPC gives extra health, but being shot results in a constant health drop (in the form of a blood-bag icon). Finding bandages can stem the blood flow. If your blood-bag reaches empty, the game is over.
Audio and Visual.
The sound in the game consisted of basic sound effects in a single sound channel including footsteps, the dripping of blood, and the sound of crunching as you ate and killed people. There were three pieces of two channel music on the Amstrad CPC and C64 versions; one for the menu, and two for the human/werewolf stages. The music seamlessly blended with each other when the character morphed between stages. The CPC version of the game used 'Mode 0' resolution (160 x 200) and 16 colours, while the Spectrum used the standard 256×192 resolution. The C64 and CPC versions could have up to four characters (including the player character) on screen at the same time, whereas the Spectrum had two. The sprites and backgrounds on the Spectrum were completely different from those in the other versions.
Reception.
The game didn't receive favourable reviews thanks to the game being presented in an unfinished state. Your Sinclair magazine said it "doesn't work at all - what was envisaged as an atmospheric arcade adventure ... is just an aimless chase-about". It received a front page spread and a full page preview in an earlier release.

<doc id="20893163" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20893163" title="Breastfeeding in public">
Breastfeeding in public

Breastfeeding in public is forbidden in some jurisdictions, not addressed by law in others, and a granted legal right in public and the workplace in yet others. Where it is a legal right, some mothers may nevertheless be reluctant to breastfeed, and some people may object to the practice.
In 2014, newly elected Pope Francis, well known for his liberal outlook, drew world-wide commentary when he encouraged mothers to breastfeed in church if their babies were hungry. During a special papal baptism Pope Francis said that mothers "should not stand on ceremony" if their children were hungry. "If they are hungry, mothers, feed them, without thinking twice," he said, smiling. "Because they are the most important people here."
Attitudes by country.
Australia.
Breastfeeding in public is a right for Australian women, protected nationally by the "Sex Discrimination Act 1984". State legislation differs, but it remains illegal to discriminate against women breastfeeding in public as a protected attribute in five states and by proxy from other existing legislation in remaining states.
Canada.
In Canada, Section 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives equal rights and freedoms to men and women, without explicitly mentioning breastfeeding.
A woman asked in 2009 at a shop by an employee to stop breastfeeding publicly, supported by a manager, later received an apology and acknowledgement of customers' right to breastfeed.
Outside of degrading or dehumanizing purposes, law regards the breasts of women in Canada as equal to the breasts of men in Canada. See Topfreedom in Canada.
China.
In Shanghai, breastfeeding in public is considered embarrassing by some, but it is also accepted by many. There have been calls for the establishment of babycare facilities in public places.
France.
Public breastfeeding is legal and widely accepted.
Germany.
While public breastfeeding is widely accepted, especially since the Movement of 1968 when public "Nurse-Ins" () were common, there is no legislation that specifically addresses breastfeeding in public.
Paragraph 2 Article 6 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides that "the care and upbringing of children as the natural right of parents" while paragraph 4 "entitles every mother to the protection and care of the community".
Later, acceptance for public breastfeeding appears to have decreased and, according to surveys, an increasing number of mothers try to avoid breastfeeding in public whenever possible. In a Bundestag session a breastfeeding member of the SPD party had to leave the floor after members of the Christian Democratic Union complained that they felt disturbed by her.
India.
India has no legal statute dealing with breastfeeding. Prevalence and social acceptance vary from region to region.
Malaysia.
Discreet breastfeeding in public is accepted in Malaysia.
Netherlands.
Public breastfeeding is common and widely social accepted. There are no laws against public breastfeeding.
Dutch law states that when an employee wishes to breastfeed her baby the employer is obligated to provide the first 9 months after the birth a suitable nursing room and allow for 25% of work time to be spend on feeding the baby or pumping while on pay. After the first nine months the employer is still required to assure conditions for breastfeeding are met (like timely breaks, nursing rooms, safe environment, etc.) but does not have to pay anymore for the time spend on breastfeeding or pumping.
Norway.
Public breastfeeding is common and widely social accepted.
Philippines.
In the Philippines, breastfeeding is protected by various laws, such as the "Expanded Breastfeeding Promotion Act of 2009" and the "Milk Code of the Philippines" (Executive Order 51). Mothers are allowed to breastfeed in public. Employers are required to allow lactating employees breaks to breastfeed or express breastmilk. Offices, public establishments such as malls and schools, and government institutions are required to establish lactation stations separate from the bathroom, where mothers can breastfeed their babies or express milk. The Milk Code prohibits the advertising of infant formula or bottle teats for infants under two years old.
Saudi Arabia.
Women in Saudi Arabia only breastfeed their infants discreetly. It is prohibited for women to show any part of the body in public except the face and the hands.
Sierra Leone.
Sierra Leone has the highest infant mortality rate in the world. During a goodwill trip to the country, actress Salma Hayek breastfed on camera a hungry week-old infant whose mother could not produce milk. She said she did it to reduce the stigma associated with breastfeeding and to encourage infant nutrition.
Taiwan.
The "Public Breastfeeding Act" since November 2010 safeguards the right to breastfeed in public, while lactation rooms are set up to deal with privacy and to provide access to hot water and power supplies, with fines against interfering with a mother's right to breastfeed. After evicting a breastfeeding mother from the National Palace Museum on 18 July 2012 and enraging many Taiwanese website users, the supposedly offending employee and her employer were both fined 6000 new Taiwan dollars (about 200 United States dollars), said the Department of Health, Taipei City Government (), but the Museum would appeal.
United Kingdom.
Breastfeeding in public (restaurants, cafes, libraries etc.) is protected under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 under the provision of goods, facilities and services section. If the child is under 6 months old, the mother has additional protection under a 2008 amendment to the act which protects maternity rights. This is superseded by the Equality Act 2010 which clarifies that a business must not discriminate against a woman who is breastfeeding a child of any age in a public place. Her companion(s) are also protected by this act.
A 2004 UK Department of Health survey found that 84% (about 5 out of 6 people) find breastfeeding in public acceptable if done discreetly; however, 67% (2 out of 3) of mothers were worried about general opinion being against public breastfeeding. To combat these fears in Scotland, the Scottish Parliament passed legislation safeguarding the freedom of women to breastfeed in public in 2005. The legislation allows for fines of up to £2500 for preventing breastfeeding of a child up to the age of 2 years old in public places.,
United States.
In the United States, legislation regarding breastfeeding varies from state to state and a limited federal law only applies to federal government premises. A United States House of Representatives appropriations bill (HR 2490) contained an amendment specifically permitting breastfeeding was signed into law on September 29, 1999. It stipulated that no government funds may be used to enforce any prohibition on women breastfeeding their children in Federal buildings or on Federal property. Further, a Federal law also enacted in 1999 specifically provides that "a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location."
Section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and required employers to provide a reasonable break time for an employee to breastfeed her child if it is less than one year old. The employee must be allowed to breastfeed in a private place, other than a bathroom. The employer is not required to pay the employee during the break time. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are not required to comply with the law if doing so would impose an undue hardship to the employer based on its size, finances, nature, or structure of its business.
A number of incidents of harassment of nursing mothers which gained media attention prompted a number of U.S. states to act. All 50 states have passed legislation that either explicitly allows women to breastfeed in public, or exempts them from prosecution for public indecency or indecent exposure for doing so.
Recent controversies.
Public breastfeeding.
There have been incidents of owners of premises, or people present, objecting to or forbidding breastfeeding. In some cases the mothers have left; in others, where a law guaranteeing the right to breastfeed has been broken, there has been legal action. Sometimes a company has apologised after the fact. One woman not allowed to breastfeed despite showing the Kentucky, USA law that gave the right left, but later organized several "nurse-in" protests in front of the restaurant and other public places.
In June 2007, Brooke Ryan was dining in a booth at the rear of an Applebee's restaurant when she found it necessary to breastfeed her 7-month-old son. While she said she attempted to be discreet, another patron complained to the manager about indecent exposure. Both a waitress and the manager asked her to cover up. She handed him a copy of the Kentucky law that permitted public breastfeeding, but he would not relent. She ended up feeding her son in her car and later organized "nurse-out" protests in front of the restaurant and other public locations. Most U.S. states (40 as of January 2009) have laws clarifying a woman's right to breastfeed in public.
In 2008 a woman in New Orleans, USA put a tent over her truck at a street festival so she could nurse her daughter privately. She was cited by police for an "unauthorized booth" and removed from the street festival.
"Babytalk" magazine cover.
In 2006, the editors of US "Babytalk" magazine received many complaints from readers after the cover of the August issue depicted a baby nursing at a bare breast. Even though the model's nipple was not shown, readers—many of them mothers—wrote that the image was "gross". In a follow-up poll, one-quarter of 4,000 readers who responded thought the cover was negative. "Babytalk" editor Susan Kane commented, "There's a huge puritanical streak in Americans." In a 2004 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, only 43% of the 3,719 respondents believed women ought to have the right to breast-feed in public.
"Mother & Baby" magazine.
In June, 2010, a deputy editor for the leading UK parenting magazine "Mother & Baby" set off a storm of protest when she described breastfeeding as "creepy." Kathryn Blundell told readers that she bottlefed her child from birth because, "I wanted my body back to give my boobs at least a chance to stay on my chest rather than dangling around my stomach." She upset readers when she wrote about her breasts, "They're part of my sexuality, too – not just breasts, but fun bags. And when you have that attitude (and I admit I made no attempt to change it), seeing your teeny, tiny, innocent baby latching on where only a lover has been before feels, well, a little creepy." The anti-breastfeeding tone of her article prompted six complaints to the British Press Complaints Commission and set off considerable online debate. The magazine also received dozens of messages of support.
Barbara Walters.
In 2005 US television presenter Barbara Walters remarked on her talk show "The View" that she felt uncomfortable sitting next to a breastfeeding mother during a flight. Her comments upset some viewers who began organizing protests over the internet. A group of about 200 mothers staged a public "nurse in" where they breastfed their babies outside ABC's headquarters in New York.
Target store protest.
In December, 2011, Michelle Hickman was breastfeeding her infant at the back of a Target store in Houston, Texas. Although covered, she was asked by two employees to move to a fitting room. Hickman said one of the employees told her, "You can get a ticket and be reported for indecent exposure." She reported the harassment on Facebook, and in response a number of mothers organized public "nurse-ins" at Target stores across the United States in cities including Houston, Knoxville, and Decatur, Illinois. Trace Gallagher on FoxNews reported on the protest, and female host of "America Live" Megyn Kelly commented, “You know, I got a lot of thoughts on this, Trace.” She explained, “Let me just put it this way: I used to feel a lot differently before I had babies and you’re breastfeeding; they need to be fed and then sometimes they don’t like the cover. And before you know it, you're Megyn Kelly and you’re showing your breasts to a whole plane.”
Breastfeeding In Uniform.
In May 2012, two Air Force National Guard service members stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington chose to participate in a staged breastfeeding awareness campaign, hosted by the Mom2Mom of Fairchild Breastfeeding Support Group by being photographed breastfeeding in their uniforms. There was talk of these women being a disgrace to the uniform, and it had been compared in the debate to defecating or urinating in uniform while in public. The photographs became an instant online frenzy and were spread world wide. Photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir, another military spouse, staged and photographed the photos in question. She removed the photos from her online website and Facebook fan page in order to calm the frenzy. The intention was to raise awareness and support for women who breastfeed, inside and outside of the military lifestyle. However, with the controversy of the photographs and online publication, the message was quickly lost among critics.
The military protects women in uniform by allowing them to defer deployments for 4 to 12 months after childbirth for breastfeeding purposes. Breastfeeding service members are provided regular breaks to breastfeed or pump while on duty, and are actually provided with a comfortable and private place to do so.
Facebook controversy.
Facebook has come under fire for removing photos of mothers breastfeeding their children, citing offensive content in violation of the Facebook Terms of Service. Facebook claimed that these photos violated their decency code by showing an exposed breast, even when the baby covered the nipple. This action was described as hypocritical, since Facebook took several days to respond to calls to deactivate a paid advertisement for a dating service that used a photo of a topless model.
The breastfeeding photos controversy continued following public protests and the growth in the online membership in the Facebook group titled "Hey, Facebook, breastfeeding is not obscene! (Official petition to Facebook)." In December 2011 Facebook removed photos of mothers breastfeeding and, after public criticism, restored them. The company said it had removed the photos because they violated the pornographic rules in the company's terms and conditions. During February, 2012, the company once again removed photos of mothers breastfeeding. Founders of a Facebook group "Respect the Breast" reported that "women say they are tired of people lashing out at what is natural and what they believe is healthy for their children."

Project GAMMA

Project GAMMA was the name given to Detachment B-57, Company E (Special Operations), 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, U. S. Army in Vietnam from 1966 to 1970. It was responsible for covert intelligence collection operations in Cambodia.
History.
Detachment B-57 arrived in Vietnam in June 1967. On 26 February 1968 it was moved from Saigon to Nha Trang and it received the designation Project GAMMA on 1 April 1968, in conjunction with other special forces units such as Project DELTA (Detachment B-52) and Project SIGMA (Detachment B-56), both responsible for Special Recon. Members of the detachment operated from nine sites under the cover of civil affairs and psychological operations offices.
Project Gamma was responsible for obtaining intelligence on Cambodian support for the activities of both regular and irregular units of the Vietnam People's Army, as well as irregular camps in Cambodia. The top intelligence officer on General Abrams' staff stated in October 1968 that Project GAMMA was providing 65 percent of the known data on NVA base camps and strengths in Cambodia, as well as 75 percent of the same data on South Vietnam. According to historian Shelby Stanton, by early 1969 Detachment B-57 "had developed into the finest and most productive intelligence-collection operation the United States had in Southeast Asia". Stanton attributes this success to the South Vietnamese authorities not being aware of operations conducted by the detachment's indigenous agents.
According to some sources, GAMMA was also responsible for intelligence operation against Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
Capture, interrogation, and killing of Chu Van Thai Khac.
In early 1969 some of Detachment B-57's sources of information started to disappear. This led the detachment's leadership to conclude that its intelligence agents had been compromised. In the spring of 1969 a reconnaissance detachment operating in Cambodia captured photos showing Chu Van Thai Khac (AKA Thai Khac Chuyen), a South Vietnamese GAMMA agent, meeting with North Vietnamese intelligence officers. Chuyen was subsequently arrested and interrogated for ten days, with polygraph tests indicating that he had compromised security arrangements and was working with the Viet Cong. Various ways of dealing with Chuyen were discussed within Detachment B-57, including possibly killing him. While the 5th Special Forces Group's executive officer strongly opposed killing Chuyen, the detachment's commander and operations officer met with the CIA headquarters in Saigon who suggested that "elimination ... might be the best course of action".
On 20 June 1969, three officers assigned to Project GAMMA drugged Chuyen, took him out on a boat into Nha Trang Bay, shot him twice in the head and dumped his body into the South China Sea. A cover story claiming that Chuyen had been sent on a one-way mission as a test of his loyalty was later approved by the 5th Special Forces Group's commander, Colonel Robert B. Rheault.
Later, Sergeant Alvin Smith, Chuyen's former handler, became concerned for his safety and sought sanctuary with the CIA in Nha Trang where he revealed that Chuyen had been killed. General Abrams heard of the matter and ordered the arrest of Smith and seven involved officers, including Colonel Rheault. The case went to trial and was covered extensively by the media, and led to popular knowledge of the term "terminate with extreme prejudice" as a euphemism for "execute". The Army defense lawyers for the eight soldiers called General Abrams and CIA officials to the witness stand. Both declined to get involved in the proceedings and testify. Finally in September 1969, Secretary of the Army Stanley Resor announced to all that all charges would be dropped against the eight soldiers since the CIA, in the interests of national security, had refused to make its personnel available as witnesses, therefore making any manner of a fair trial impossible.
Project GAMMA was deactivated on 31 March 1970.
An official Army history of the Green Berets, published after the Vietnam War, does not mention Project GAMMA or Detachment B-57. Although the Pentagon has declassified much material about Green Beret crossborder operations inside Laos and Cambodia, nothing on Project Gamma has been made available.
Organization.
Project Gamma used members of the Khmer Serei and the Khmer Kampuchean Krom in its activities inside Cambodia.
It consisted of five collection teams supervising 13 nets with 98 indigenous agents.
A listing of the personnel assigned to Detachment B57 "GAMMA" is available from Radix Press Houston, Texas.

Botija

The botija (botijuela; bunga) is a Caribbean musical instrument of the aerophone type. The botija is a potbellied earthenware jug or jar with two openings and was used in the early son sextetos in Cuba as a bass instrument.
Origination.
The botija was used to hold kerosene that was brought from Spain. The botijas were then utilized to hide money underground and were buried to prevent humidity from reaching the floors. The botijas were later dug up and used as musical instruments in the late nineteenth century in the Caribbean island of Cuba. This type of music was called Cuba Son and the botijas were used as bass instruments. The botijas contained two openings, one at the top and one of the side, and were filled to specific levels with water in order to generate certain pitches and were then blown into to create bass notes. Another technique used to play the instrument includes the placement of a reed into the botija opening while the player blows into the reed. The use of the botija throughout parts of Cuba ended after the early twentieth century and was replaced by the double bass.
Use in the Cuban Son.
Cuban Son originated in the eastern part of Cuba in the late nineteenth century. The music's defining characteristic was a pulsing or anticipated bass that falls between the downbeat, leading to the creation of many bass instruments including the botija. Other instruments included a marímbula, serrucho, contrabajo, and bajo. Other bass instruments were used according to the size of the musical arrangement or timbre of the bass instrument needed. The marímbula for example was used mainly for smaller ensembles as it was not easily heard whereas the bajo, an electrical bass, could be easily projected and heard over many other instruments.

Postage stamps and postal history of Norfolk Island

The postage stamps and postal history of Norfolk Island depended on Australia until 1947, when the island, an Australian territory since 1914, received its own stamps and a postal autonomy.
After the transfer of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands' philatelic and postal services to Australia Post, Norfolk had been the last Australian territory to be postally independent. Consequently, the stamps issued by Norfolk had no value in Australia, and those of Australia Post could not be used in the island.
Before 1947.
The formal postal history of Norfolk began with the second penal settlement organised on the island between 1824 and 1855. The first post office opened in 1832.
The first postage stamps used there were sent by Van Diemen's Land, the colony administratively responsible for the settlement. Decided late 1853, the first stamps figuring Queen Victoria, worth sixteen pounds, travelled on the "Lady Franklin". Part of them were lost when the prisoners aboard the ship mutinied and flew away. The second packet of stamps arrived finally to Norfolk and they were used between July 1854 and May 1855, when the penal colony was closed and all people evacuated. The stamps used in Norfolk can be distinguished by the number marked by the cancellation: "72".
Even if the island was repopulated in 1856 by migrants from the Pitcairn Islands, authorized by the United Kingdom, Norfolk received a postal service and postage stamps not before 1877. The British authorities asked New South Wales to provided them to Norfolk. However, the stamp stock was not regularly reconstituted until 1898, and, with no postage stamp, the "NORFOLK ISLAND" cancel stamp sent in 1892 was not used until 1898.
With the constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, the stamps of Australia replaced those of New South Wales in 1913.
After 1947.
First issues.
Norfolk, then an external territory since 1914, asked for its own postage stamps in 1923, and again in 1937. The latter was accepted and the first issue was previewed for 1940. These postage stamps were designed and engraved by Frank Manley, printed and perforated eleven teeth per two centimeters. They represented Ball Bay and the "FOUNDED 1788" mention, starting year of the first penal settlement. The issue was cancelled when World War II began. They were later destroyed, but some stolen stamps and sheets that reached the philatelic market.
Finally, twelve stamps from half-penny to two shillings were issued on 10 June 1947. Manley's "Ball Bay" design was used, with a different perforation of fourteen.
To complete this series face values, a second of six stamps was issued on 10 June 1953 picturing human constructions of the island, from the Warder's Tower on the three pence and a half to the Blooding Bridge on the five shillings. Two of these stamps, the seven pence and a half and the eight and a half, were the first overprinted stamps of Norfolk to confront a change of postal rates.
On 8 June 1956, was issued the first commemorative stamp marking the centenary of the arrival of Pitcairners, the first permanent and non penal settlement on Norfolk. The second commemorative needed to overprint the Australian stamp for the 150 years of postal service in Australia picturing Isaac Nichols, the first postmaster of New South Wales. Worth four pence in Australia, it was overprinted five pence for use in Norfolk.
After 1960.
Starting 1960, the philatelic issues of Norfolk progressively were more numerous, with hiring of British printers in the 1970s.
In 1960, a new definitive stamp series began using the island's fauna and flora, completed with new values afterwards, and renew regularly. Other series circulated too picturing ships and captains of the Pacific Ocean history, like James Cook. A Christmas stamp had been issued every year, first by reusing the Australian stamp design until 1966. On the religious topic, personalities of Anglicanism were honored by commemorative stamps.
Political life of the island appeared too in 1960 with a two shilling eight pence stamp figuring Queen Elizabeth II by Pietro Annigoni and a map of Norfolk. It commemorated the institution of local government. Institutional evolutions and anniversaries were topic of stamps: 50 years of the statute of territory in 1964, 125 years of annexion to Van Diemen's Land in 1969, the first Legislative Assembly in 1979, ten years of internal self-governing in 1989.
Progressively, the philatelic program explored non local topics: commemorations of the Pacific War, life of Queen Elizabeth II and of the British Royal Family, historic events anniversaries as powered flights in 2003, etc.
On a technical side, with the help of Walsall Security Printers, Norfolk issued between 1974 and 1978 fourteen self-adhesive stamps cut in the form of the island: two for the 150 years of its second penal settlement, four for the centenary of the Universal Postal Union using Norfolk landscapes, and eight about the Scout Movement.

Steven Vanackere, () born 4 February 1964 in Wevelgem, Belgium, is a Flemish politician, member of the Christian Democratic and Flemish Party (CD&V). He held the portfolios of Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Institutional Reform in the Leterme II Government. On 7 January 2014, the CD&V designated Steven Vanackere as the third-placed candidate, behind serving MEPs Ivo Belet and Marianne Thyssen, on its list for the European Parliament elections in May 2014. It had been considered unlikely by commentators that he would accept this place as initially when it was offered to him in December 2013, he had indicated his disappointment and seemed set to reject it, saying this would probably mark the end of his political career, given the perceived upward struggle facing the CD&V in retaining its third seat in the new post-2014-election configuration of the European Parliament, both in view of the fact that Belgium's Flemish parties will have one fewer seat in the new Parliament and the increase in popularity of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) since the previous European Parliament elections. Steven Vanackere lives in Neder-Over-Heembeek Brussels).
He is the son of Leo Vanackere, who, following a political career as a Member of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate of Belgium, became Provincial Governor of West-Flanders in 1979. His grandfather, Remi Wallays, had also been a Senator and had been a former Mayor of Wevelgem.

In 1985, Steven Vanackere passed the (Bachelor’s) degree in political science. During the academic year of 1986-1987, he served as President of the Law Students’ Association and the Vlaams Rechtsgenootschap (Flemish Law Society) in Leuven.
Professional career.
He began his professional career with the Kredietbank (KBC) in 1987 but went on to join CEPESS, the Research Centre of the then Christian Democratic Party, CVP – PSC, in 1988, where he became Political Advisor to CVP Chairman Herman Van Rompuy. In 1991, he was appointed Deputy Head of Staff to Jos Chabert, Minister of the Brussels-Capital Region, before becoming the Minister’s Head of Staff, a post he held from 1995 to 1999.

In 2005, Steven Vanackere and Cathy Berx, then Members of the Flemish parliament, co-authored the book “Vergrijzing en Verkleuring and Changing Racial Mix” by former Minister-President of Flanders, Yves Leterme (Editor-in-chief Mark Van de Voorde), published by the Davidsfonds in 2005, to which he contributed on the issue of ‘aging’.
He formed part of the CD&V’s Political Executive and, together with former Members of the Chamber of Representatives, Herman Van Rompuy and Greta D’hondt, and with Koen Van den Heuvel, Member of the Flemish Parliament, he wrote the CD&V’s “Sociaal-Economisch Alternatief Alternative” as a counterpoise to the “Generatiepact Pact” of the federal purple government – Verhofstadt II (coalition of Socialist and Liberal parties).

Digital Lady

Digital Lady was an experimental rock band from San Francisco. The band formed in 1968 when Desmond Wolfe and Ioine Cusmari discovered a common interest in subversion, tattoos, and The Meters. They soon added Donald Twain on bass and Manfred Ziegler on drums to round out the group. Manfred was brother to Ron Ziegler, notable for serving for a time in the Nixon Administration and calling Watergate a "third-rate burglary".
Their first EP, "Lush Bum", was poorly received except in small circles in and around the Laurel Heights district of San Francisco. It wasn't until their full length, "Impeccable Creams", was released that they began to develop a substantial following.
First Efforts.
On February 29, at a 'Leap Year Party' they'd mutually crashed, Cusmari encountered Wolfe attempting to steal the recently released musical album, "Switched-On Bach". Their discussion quickly turned to a mutual affinity for the 900 Series Moog synthesizer. Shortly after, Cusmari and Wolfe took to the studio to record their first EP, "Lush Bum". Consisting of six tracks (total running length 22:16), "Lush Bum" was allegedly recorded in only two weeks. Although photographs of the recording sessions have yet to be unearthed, the recording setup was said to be notoriously sparse; Cusmari and Wolfe recorded their EP with two acoustic guitars and a single Shure SM58 microphone. Drums were improvised using kitchen dishes and utensils.
Unfortunately, upon the release of "Lush Bum", Digital Lady failed to gain the respect of their peers in the San Francisco music community. The EP was universally scorned by critics for its thinly veiled innuendo and brash obscenities, and was mocked for its rudimentary attempts to duplicate the sounds of the Moog synthesizer with acoustic guitars. However, the falsetto-drenched harmonies of Cusmari and Wolfe were generally well-respected.
Influences.
Digital Lady's essence can be heard in a variety of today's bands, including The Provisionals, who covered the Digital Lady song, "Girls In Green", on their first EP. Similarly, smatterings of Digital Lady can be heard here and there throughout the shoegaze genre. There is also mention of "thumbs gone weird", in the movie, Withnail and I.

Le dessous des cartes

Le Dessous Des Cartes (Mit offenen Karten in German, literally translated "with open cards", or 'maps') is a weekly broadcast on geopolitics from the Franco-German Arte channel. The show makes great use of maps as visual support. It stars the geographer and geo-politician Jean-Christophe Victor (son of the explorer Paul-Emile Victor).
The content of the show is jointly prepared by Jean-Christophe Victor and the "Laboratoire d'études politiques et d'analyses cartographiques" (Laboratory for Political Studies and Map analysis), known as LEPAC, and of which he is the founder and main shareholder.
Programming and format.
The show was first aired from 1990 to 1992, on La Sept until it stopped broadcasting, and has been on air since 1992 on the Franco-German channel Arte. The show is broadcast every Saturday at 20h00 (Paris local time, UTC+1) and rebroadcast several times a week. The format of the show has changed little since the first episode. However, the episode length expanded from 7 to 11 minutes. The transition from 11 to 26 minutes referred to by Jean-Christophe Victor in 2002 was abandoned.
Structure of the show.
In general, the show runs as follows:
Maps and visualization methods.
Topographic maps are based on the Ordnance Survey Oxford Cartographers. The most commonly used Map projection is that of Eckert (the Pseudo-cylindrical projection). The show also uses satellite imagery from Google Earth and the first use was in the episode named: "Nigeria, rich state poor country."
Program production cycle.
The "Laboratoire d'études politiques et d'analyses cartographiques" (LEPAC) produces about forty episodes a year for the channel Arte. The subjects for most episodes are decided a year in advance to allow time for production. This delay in the selection of themes allows a certain hindsight regarding the chosen topic. However, on occasion, the topic of an episode is more closely related to current events. For example, the episode "Tsunami, a natural phenomenon" aired just three months after the events in South-East Asia.).
The subjects of the show.
Of the 300 programs (from March 2001 to May 2008), 210 (70%) have a geographical approach and 84 (28%) have a thematic approach. 6 issues remain unclassifiable: introspective (ex: "La Methode le Dessous des Cartes") or dreamers (ex: "A journey with Corto Maltese, Turkey to Samarkand")
For information and the geographical most commonly accepted:
Anecdote: The issue of 29 March 2000, for the week of April 1, is a parody of the show itself. The producing team of the show made what could be the episode of 1 April 3000 by offering a retrospective view of the past thousand years.
The methods and objectives of the programme.
In a special 10th birthday episode named "La méthode du Dessous des Cartes", the aims of the show were outlined:
The main, oft repeated aim of the show is "to understand rather than to inform."
Positions.
The main positions of the show and its sponsors are as follows: in favor of Human rights, Sustainable development, and the Proposals for a Palestinian state, and against the concepts of Ethnic cleansing, Just War and The Clash of Civilizations (as suggested for example by Samuel P. Huntington).
Publications.
Video on demand.
The site artevod (www.artevod.fr) offers the episodes of the show for download in the Windows Media Video format.
DVD.
Each semester, Arte Video and LEPAC publish a DVD. The DVD includes 12 to 20 episodes of the show regarding a theme. DVDs released so far:

De Montfort Park

De Montfort Park is a football stadium in Hinckley, Leicestershire. It was the home of Hinckley United, an English football club from the town, until it was dissolved in October 2013.
The stadium complex covers and includes three full size pitches, two three-quarter size pitches, three half size pitches and a full size, all-weather floodlit 3G rubber crumb surface pitch. It is named in honour of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester.
The flagship of the complex is the Leicester Road Stadium, a 4,329 capacity purpose-built football ground, also comprising gymnasium, sports injury clinic and a social club. The Stadium opened in March 2005 when Stalybridge Celtic were the first team to play Hinckley United on the ground, in front of a crowd of over 2000.
Stadium Sponsorship.
When the Stadium opened in 2005 it was known as the Marston's Stadium, following a sponsorship deal between Hinckley United and Marston's Brewery. The Brewery paid what Regional Sales Manager Bob Leatherland called a 'substantial six figure sum' to secure the naming rights with the money paid out at £25,000 per year over a ten-year period. However, the brewery altered its sponsorship strategy, moving mainly into the cricket Twenty20 competition, and the deal ended early in a mutual agreement between the brewery and football club at the end of December 2008.
In January 2009 the club announced a stadium sponsorship deal with the Greene King Brewery and the stadium was renamed the Greene King Stadium. The sponsorship deal with Greene King Brewery ran out at the end of the 2012-2013 season, as confirmed by Chairman Mike Sutton. The Stadium name then reverted to the Leicester Road Stadium, due to its proximity to Leicester Road.
Stands.
The stadium has provision for segregated seating of away stands with 80 seats on the Main Stand and 850 places on the West Stand. The Away Turnstiles are only operable when segregation is in place.
Other Uses.
Leicester City reserves have used the De Montfort Park Stadium for their home games in 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The Greene King Stadium is used by the Leicestershire FA for finals of their regional competitions. It staged International Youth games in 2006. England U19s used the facilities for training in 2006 ahead of a match against the Czech Republic at Northampton's Sixfields Stadium. 
In April 2007, April 2008 and April 2010 the Stadium was used by the English FA as a semi final venue for the National FA Sunday Cup.
Aston Villa Reserves use the stadium for a selection of their winter home games from 2009-2012.
In April 2012 the FA announced that the Stadium would be one of the venues for the UEFA European Women's U17 Championship Finals.
In July 2012 the Stadium was selected for two international Mens U17s matches, alongside Burton's Pirelli Stadium and Northampton's Sixfields Stadium, as part of a friendly tournament involving England, Italy, Turkey and Portugal.
The stadium hosted the Portugal U17s 1-0 Italy U17s, and Italy U17s 3-1 Turkey U17s matches.
It has also been proposed as a new home for Coventry City F.C., due to mounting debts regarding the Ricoh Arena and arguments that the rent is far too high in comparison to clubs around them and below the Premier League
