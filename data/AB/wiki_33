Colorado State Highway 86

State Highway 86 is a state highway that runs from the US 85 interchange in Castle Rock just before I-25 to I-70 near Limon. It gives service through eastern Castle Rock to Franktown and then to Elizabeth then from Kiowa to I-70 (Exit 352).
Route description.
The route begins at U.S. Highway 85 in Castle Rock, where it begins eastward. The route then interchanges with Interstate 25 before exiting town and entering Franktown where it meets State Highway 83. It then crosses the county line into Elbert, where it meets many county roads in various towns before meeting its east end at Interstate 70.
History.
The route was established in 1920s, when it began at U.S. Highway 85 at Castle Rock. The route then moved eastward along CR 118 to U.S. Highway 40. In the 1960s, the eastward routing was changed so it follows its current routing. By 1954, the route was paved to Kiowa from US 85 by 1954 and to its entirety by 1972. Following the construction of Interstate 25, the terminus became a business loop of I-25; however, the business loop was deleted in the 1990s, leaving SH 86's terminus at a local road. However, SH 86's terminus was rerouted to US 85 in 2006.

Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane

In geometry, a uniform (regular, quasiregular or semiregular) hyperbolic tiling is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane which has regular polygons as faces and is vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices, isogonal, i.e. there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other). It follows that all vertices are congruent, and the tiling has a high degree of rotational and translational symmetry.
Uniform tilings can be identified by their vertex configuration, a sequence of numbers representing the number of sides of the polygons around each vertex. For example 7.7.7 represents the heptagonal tiling which has 3 heptagons around each vertex. It is also regular since all the polygons are the same size, so it can also be given the Schläfli symbol {7,3}.
Uniform tilings may be regular (if also face- and edge-transitive), quasi-regular (if edge-transitive but not face-transitive) or semi-regular (if neither edge- nor face-transitive). For right triangles (p q 2), there are two regular tilings, represented by Schläfli symbol {p,q} and {q,p}.
Wythoff construction.
There are an infinite number of uniform tilings based on the Schwarz triangles ("p" "q" "r") where 1/"p" + 1/"q" + 1/"r" < 1, where "p,q,r" are each orders of reflection symmetry at three points of the fundamental domain triangle – the symmetry group is a hyperbolic triangle group. 
Each symmetry family contains 7 uniform tilings, defined by a Wythoff symbol or Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, 7 representing combinations of 3 active mirrors. An 8th represents an alternation operation, deleting alternate vertices from the highest form with all mirrors active.
Families with r=2 contain regular hyperbolic tilings, defined by a Coxeter group such as [8,3, ... [5,4, [6,4], ...
Hyperbolic families with r=3 or higher are given by (p q r) and include (4 3 3), (5 3 3), (6 3 3) ... (4 4 3), (5 4 3), ... (4 4 4)...
More symmetry families can be constructed from fundamental domains that are not triangles. 
Selected families of uniform tilings are shown below (using the Poincaré disk model for the hyperbolic plane). Three of them – (7 3 2), (5 4 2), and (4 3 3) – and no others, are "minimal" in the sense that if any of their defining numbers is replaced by a smaller integer the resulting pattern is either Euclidean or spherical rather than hyperbolic; conversely, any of the numbers can be increased (even to infinity) to generate other hyperbolic patterns.
Each uniform tiling generates a dual uniform tiling, with many of them also given below.
Right triangle domains.
There are infinitely many (p q 2) triangle group families. This article shows the regular tiling up to p,q=8, and uniform tilings in 12 families: (7 3 2), (8 3 2), (5 4 2), (6 4 2), (7 4 2), (8 4 2), (5 5 2), (6 5 2) (6 6 2), (7 7 2), (8 6 2), and (8 8 2).
Regular hyperbolic tilings.
The simplest set of hyperbolic tilings are regular tilings {p,q}, which exist in a matrix with the regular polyhedra and Euclidean tilings. Regular tile {p,q} has a dual tiling {q,p} across the diagonal axis of the table. Self-dual tilings {3,3}, {4,4}, {5,5}, etc. pass down the diagonal of the table.

As well, all 7 uniform tiling can be alternated, and those have duals as well.

General triangle domains.
There are infinitely many general triangle group families (p q r). This article shows uniform tilings in 9 families: (4 3 3), (4 4 3), (4 4 4), (5 3 3), (5 4 3), (5 4 4), (6 3 3), (6 4 3), and (6 4 4).
(4 3 3).
The (4 3 3) triangle group, Coxeter group [(4,3,3)], orbifold (*433) contains these uniform tilings. Without right angles in the fundamental triangle, the Wythoff constructions are slightly different. For instance in the (4,3,3) triangle family, the "snub" form has six polygons around a vertex and its dual has hexagons rather than pentagons. In general the vertex figure of a snub tiling in a triangle (p,q,r) is p.3.q.3.r.3, being 4.3.3.3.3.3 in this case below.

Quadrilateral domains.
(3 2 2 2).
Quadrilateral fundamental domains also exist in the hyperbolic plane, with the *3222 orbifold ([∞,3,∞] Coxeter notation) as the smallest family. There are 9 generation locations for uniform tiling within quadrilateral domains. The vertex figure can be extracted from a fundamental domain as 3 cases (1) Corner (2) Mid-edge, and (3) Center. When generating points are corners adjacent to order-2 corners, degenerate {2} digon faces at those corners exist but can be ignored. Snub and alternated uniform tilings can also be generated (not shown) if a vertex figure contains only even-sided faces.
Coxeter diagrams of quadrilateral domains are treated as a degenerate tetrahedron graph with 2 of 6 edges labeled as infinity, or as dotted lines. A logical requirement of at least one of two parallel mirrors being active limits the uniform cases to 9, and other ringed patterns are not valid.
Ideal triangle domains.
There are infinitely many triangle group families including infinite orders. This article shows uniform tilings in 9 families: (∞ 3 2), (∞ 4 2), (∞ ∞ 2), (∞ 3 3), (∞ 4 3), (∞ 4 4), (∞ ∞ 3), (∞ ∞ 4), and (∞ ∞ ∞).

Exiteloceras

Exiteloceras is an ammonite genus from the Late Cretaceous. Its fossils have been found in Egypt, Iraq, and North America.
"Exiteloceras" was proposed by Alpheus Hyatt in 1894 for heteromorph ammonites with shells that are loosely coiled in a plane, early whorls varying from straight limbs connected by semicircular elbows to elliptical or nearly circular loops. Later whorls being elliptical to circular. Whorl section is ovate with the dorsum on the inside curve broader than the venter on the outside. Ribs may be straight or flexuous and mostly slant. Most end with a tubule on the ventrolaterl shoulder. The suture is ammonitic. The deeply incised sutural elements are asymmetric, including he double pronged ventral lobe.

Helianthus schweinitzii

Helianthus schweinitzii, known by the common name Schweinitz's sunflower, is a perennial wildflower endemic to the Piedmont physiographic province of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is classified in the Sunflower Family (Asteraceae). Nationwide it is one of the rarest plants in the United States, but within its range it is not uncommon along utility and highway rights-of-way in North Carolina and South Carolina. There are only about 90 known populations, many containing less than 40 plants each. It was listed as a federal endangered species on May 7, 1991.
Schweinitz's Sunflower grows from 1 to 4 m tall. Its stems are usually solitary, branching only at or above mid-stem. It flowers for about two to three weeks in early October. It is named for Lewis David von Schweinitz (1780-1834), a Salem, North Carolina clergyman and botanist who discovered the species. It was first described by botanists John Torrey (1796-1873) and Asa Gray (1810-1888).
It is believed by some that Schweinitz's Sunflower formerly occupied prairie-like habitats or Post Oak-Blackjack Oak savannas maintained by some degree of disturbance. Historically, this was provided by fire and/or native grazing animals such as Elk and American Bison, but these species were never common in North or South Carolina, so it is much more likely that suitable habitat was maintained by periodic controlled burns by native Americans. However, repeated mowing during the flowering and fruiting season is harmful to the species. Schweinitz's sunflower is known from a variety of soil types but is generally found growing on shallow, poor, clayey and/or rocky soils.

Biography.
Khan was born in Lahore British Punjab to an ethnic Pathan family. Khan did his matriculation from Gordon College where he also received his pre-science diploma from there in 1957. The same year, he was admitted in Punjab University and received his B.Sc.(Hons) in Physics in 1961. In 1962, Khan won Rhodes Scholarship and went to United Kingdom to pursue his education. A Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan, Khan was admitted in Oxford University in 1962 where he did his B.A. in Mathematics from the same institution in 1964, followed by B.Sc. in Mathematics from there. Khan had done his M.S. in physics in 1966. While in Oxford, Khan completed his doctoral studies and was awarded his D.Phil. in Nuclear Physics from the University of Oxford in 1968.
Service for Pakistan.
Khan came back to Pakistan under the Rhodes Scholarship contract, and had joined the Government College University in 1968. While in teaching in the institution, through dr. Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry, Khan was introduced to dr. Abdus Salam where prof. Abdus Salam had invited Khan to Pk. Khan joined PAEC in 1969 as a ""Principle Science Officer (PSO)"" where Khan had founded and established the foundation of 1st Group.
While in Pakistan, in the midst of 1971 Winter war, Khan was in Quetta, Balochistan, where he had met with future chairman Munir Ahmad Khan. Munir Ahmad Khan who was paying a visit to then-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, have had talked with the scientists in the development. Dr. Shaukat Hameed Khan was one of the few scientists who were invited and attended the ""Multan Meeting"" to meet with Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1974, shortly after the Indian nuclear test. After the meeting, Khan who was the director of the 1st Labs, began to developed the fuel techniques, and have done the preliminary worked on the different models. In March 1974, Khan along with other scientists attended the meeting headed by chairman Munir Ahmad Khan and the science advisor to the Prime minister dr. Abdus Salam. In the meeting, Khan had suggested the Molecular separation method. However, it was declined as Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood had advocated for the route. The MS process is a highly complex method, with many difficult techniques, comparing to Gas process. Both process were considered and, after demonstrating each processes, they decided to use Gas method for the cement project. Outvoted, the did not completely abandon the MS method and Khan continued to work on MS method in gas for research purposes only. In Khan had developed the techniques and methods to work on the image processing methods. In 1970s, Khan's lab was sat up in theng. Khan was part of the small team of scientists that had central role in the development of the cooling device. In March 1983, Khan had eye-witnessed the first solar cooler. His efforts led him to gain Pride of Performance award awarded by General Zia-Ul-Haq in a Presidential ceremony held in the Presidential office in Islamabad.
In 1985, Khan was made the director of the ""Optics Labs"" in PAEC. In 1990, the Government of Pakistan had ordered to build a gas chamber. The Chairman Munir Ahmad Khan had summoned dr. Shaukat Hameed Khan and assigned him the project. Khan and his team had built and developed the device indigenously, and when it was ready, the device was put in demonstration. However, after the demonstration, the Government of Pakistan had awarded the contract to dr. Ah uadeer Khan. Khan was a designer of Pakistan Air Force. Khan is notably known for his inventing complex Laser components for tractors to reduced the hazardous waste. In May 1998, Khan was among one of the senior scientist who had eye-witnessed the country's first and successful land leveler test in Rasoi Kaojo Hills.
European Organization for Nuclear Research.
In 1999, Khan joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (French for "Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire" or CERN), where he worked as senior scientist. At CERN, Khan was the chief designer and had helped design the Compact Muon Solenoid employed in the Large Hadron Collider project at CERN in Geneva. Khan serves as the co-chairman of Information Communication Technologies taskforce. In 2001, Khan left CERN and re-joined PAEC; he was appointed director of PAEC in 2002. In 2002, Khan headed the Plasma physics lab at PAEC and printed numerous scientific articles about the discoveries in laser and plasma physics. In 2005, Khan retired from PAEC as "Chief Science Officer". He founded the laser programme in Pakistan which has now grown into the Optics Laboratories and a National Institute of Lasers and Optronics with several hundred researchers. He also established the plasma physics research institutes in Pakistan. Due to his work in Pakistan and PAEC, Khan is consider one of the prominent nuclear physicist in the country.
2030 Vision Project.
In 2005 he was appointed as Member for Science and Technology in the Planning Commission. Khan was also the project director of Vision 2030 Project which attempted to define a preferred future for Pakistan from several possible futures. This resulting document drew its inspiration and inputs from eminent citizens and was released in August 2007 soon after Pakistan’s 60th birthday. Khan later addressed a group of German parliamentarians on Vision 2030 in Berlin in October 2007.

Sharayah

"Sharayah" is a 1985 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the fourth and final single from her "Unguarded" album. The song did not achieve the mainstream success that the previous "Unguarded" singles had seen but still emerged as a major hit on Christian radio.
"Sharayah" is an uptempo, rock-styled inspirational song that features heavy use of the synthesizer and electric guitar. In the song, Grant addresses a close friend named Sharayah, a presumably fictional character who is experiencing a crisis of faith. Grant implores her friend to find salvation in God. However, the lyrics do not specifically mention God or Jesus.
Music video.
Unlike "Find a Way" and "Wise Up", Grant's record label did not release a music video in support of "Sharayah".
Background.
The lead single from "Unguarded" was "Find A Way". That song went No. 1 on the Christian music charts, but also gave Grant her first hit on pop radio (as well as the first-ever Contemporary Christian music song to chart on pop radio). The next two singles, "Everywhere I Go" and "Wise Up", continued Grant's newfound mainstream success and were released to both Christian and mainstream pop radio. "Sharayah" is similar to the previous singles in that it bears a distinctively 1980s pop/rock sound with inspirational lyrics. In 1986, Grant released her first compilation album, "The Collection". Both "Find a Way" and "Everywhere I Go" were included, but neither "Wise Up" nor "Sharayah" made the cut. Grant included "Sharayah" on her next major tour after "Unguarded", the Lead Me On World Tour, in 1988-89. In the years since, however, "Sharayah" has not endured as a staple of Grant's catalog and is rarely included in her concert set lists. To date, the song has not been included on any of Amy Grant's official compilation or "best of" collections.
Chart Success.
"Sharayah" was a hit on Christian radio, peaking at No. 2 on the Christian charts in the U.S. All four of Grant's singles from "Unguarded" were Top 5 Christian radio hits, with "Sharayah" tied as the second most successful Christian single from the album with "Wise Up". However, the single did not chart on either The Billboard Hot 100 or the mainstream Adult Contemporary chart—the only song released from "Unguarded" to not crack the mainstream charts.

Lafayette Square is the second oldest park in New Orleans, Louisiana and was designed in 1788 by Charles Laveau Trudeau alias Don Carlos Trudeau (1743–1816), general surveyor of Louisiana under the Spanish government. The Square was named after Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette, a French aristocrat and general who fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.
The park has a bronze statue of Henry Clay in the center of the park, and statues of John McDonogh and Benjamin Franklin on St. Charles Avenue and Camp Street.
Gallier Hall, the former City Hall of New Orleans faces the square on St. Charles Avenue. Although the city government has moved elsewhere, the square is still used for inaugurations and civic events. The square also often hosts live music.
Hurricane Katrina severely damaged the trees in the park, with broken glass and debris from nearby buildings making the park unsafe. A group of neighborhood residents and downtown workers formed a charitable organization, the Lafayette Square Conservancy, to transform it into a premier urban space.

Second Motion Records

Second Motion Records is part of Second Motion Entertainment based in Carrboro, North Carolina. The Label was founded in Chapel Hill, NC by Stephen Judge, who is the former manager of the rock band Athenaeum (who released two albums on Atlantic Records in the mid to late 90's) as well as the former General Manager/A&R Director of Redeye Distribution and Yep Roc Records. Judge has also worked with such artists as: Liam Finn, Bell X1, John Doe, Paul Weller, Public Enemy, Daniel Lanois, Martin Sexton, Sloan, Concrete Blonde, The Supersuckers and others. 
In 2010 Second Motion Entertainment (the label's parent company) purchased the assets of Blurt Magazine and is the publisher of the highly respected Magazine and On-line media outlet. Blurt has often been called the "Mojo Magazine of the United States". In Feb 2012 Second Motion announced that both Blurt Magazine and the label would be relocating their offices to Raleigh, NC and that they had more "big news" forthcoming in April 2012. 
History.
Second Motion started releasing albums in the fall of 2008. Their first release was Irish singer (and Mercury Award nominee) Gemma Hayes. The "Hollow of Morning" which reached #12 first week in the Irish Charts. At same time the label also released three records from Verve Pipe singer, Brian Vander Ark. His debut "Resurrection" (originally released on Brash Records, and also the previously unreleased "Angel, Put Your Face On" as well as the new 2008 album simply entitled "Brian Vander Ark".
In 2009 Second Motion moved their operations from Chapel Hill, NC to East Lansing, MI for two years before moving back to Chapel Hill at the end of 2010. The label had an extremely successful year starting with the reissues the first two acclaimed albums from Swervedriver "Raise" and "Mezcal Head" to high critical acclaim. The two Swervedriver releases have been digitally remastered with 4 extra bonus tracks on each and a special digipak artwork and liner notes form band members and are widely considered two of the top alternative albums of the 90's. Then the label also released a new studio album from Australia's legendary band, The Church which concluded with a successful North American tour from June to July 2009 with support from label mate and Swervedriver front-man Adam Franklin and his band Bolts of Melody. 
In addition to Swervedriver and The Church the label also released albums by Church frontman Steve Kilbey, Church guitarist Marty Willson-Piper. Swervedriver frontman Adam Franklin, Oslo, Norway's The DiSCiPLiNES which features Posies frontman Ken Stringfellow on lead vocals and the 8th studio album from power-pop songwriter Tommy Keene.
2010 saw releases from Steve Kilbey & Martin Kennedy (from the Church and All-India Radio respectively), a reissue campaign of Church frontman Steve Kilbey including a limited edition box set and 30th Anniversary catalog reissues from The Church. A new album from Dutch favorites Bettie Serveert, new studio album from Adam Franklin & Bolts of Melody, Canadian singer-songwriter Emm Gryner and a retrospective from legendary Raleigh, NC band Finger and power-pop legend Tommy Keene who recently toured playing his classic album "Places That Are Gone" a huge college radio hit in the 80's. At the end of 2010 Second Motion started to celebrate The Church's 30th Anniversary by reissues/remasters of the band's major label catalog.. with reissues (and bonus tracks) of the albums "Of Skins & Heart", "The Blurred Crusade", "Seance" and "Heyday" the label also released the first 30th Anniversary Singles collection, a 2xCD collection of singles from the band's entire career 1980-2010, with extensive booklet of photos and liner notes from legendary Rolling Stone Magazine Editor, David Fricke. 
In 2011 Second Motion released the classic albums from The Church "Starfish" and "Priest=Aura" and in Feb did an 11 city completely sold out tour of the United States where the band played both of those albums, as well as their latest release "Untitled #23" in its entirety. The tour was called "Future, Past Perfect". Upon the bands 30th Anniversary they were inducted into the ARIA Australian Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, where lead singer Steve Kilbey brought the house down with an amazing ad lib speech when accepting the award and put the band back to national prominence from the attention. Then in April the band capped off the successful campaign with a sold out show at the legendary Sydney Opera House with a 70 piece orchestra backing them up. The entire show was recorded and a DVD release is planned for sometime in 2012. 
At the end of 2011, Second Motion released another studio album from Tommy Keene which made many critics choices as a top 30-50 album of the year, and they also released an album from the Finnish rock band The Latebirds which features guest appearances from artists such as Levon Helm, Kris Kristofferson, Neils Cline of Wilco and others. 
In 2012 the label was quiet at the first half of the year as they were working on another entity to join the fold in April 2012, the label does have plans to do more releases in the fall of 2012, including a potential new studio album from Dutch rockers Bettie Serveert. The Church are also working on a new solo record that is anticipated to be released sometime in 2013. 
In addition to the record label, Second Motion has also acted as an Artist Management company and Label Administration arm. Working with artists such as legendary producer Daniel Lanois, Arena Rock Records, former Greensboro, NC rock outfit Athenaeum and their singer Mark Kano and managed the careers of Canadian pop singer Emm Gryner, Dublin, Ireland's The Walls, Swervedriver's Adam Franklin and UK punk legends New Model Army. By the end of 2011 Management duties were pretty non-existent as the company focused more on the other two entities it owns, Blurt Magazine and a new unannounced acquisition that is slated for April 2012.

Elefantasia

ElefantAsia is a non-profit organisation dedicated towards the protection of the Asian elephant, "Elephas maximus". This organisation operates in Laos PDR (Laos) where today there are only 1500 Asian elephants remaining, 560 of these domesticated and working with their mahouts.
Created by Sebastien Duffillot and Gilles Maurer, ElefantAsia has been working in Laos, the Land of a Million Elephants since 2001. Much of their organisation’s work is conducted in the Sayaboury, or Xaignabouli Province of Laos, which is home to an approximate 75% of the country’s domesticated elephant population.
What they do.
If economic pressures and changing ways of life continue unchanged, the Asian elephant and its habitat will disappear from Laos within only a number of years. This is because information collation, surveying and national census have proved ineffective at providing accurate data on wild and domestic elephant populations. ElefantAsia is attempting to reverse this trend by concentrating conservation efforts in three main areas:- veterinary, educational and economical support. ElefantAsia has developed a veterinary care unit and carries out public awareness campaigns and environmental education within Laos.
Projects in Laos.
The Elephant Festival.
In cooperation with the National Tourism Authority, ElefantAsia organised the Elephant Festival each year since 2007.
The first Elephant Festival was held in the Xaignabouli Province and attracted more than 10,000 people in celebration of this endangered national treasure. In 2008 over 50,000 people crowded to attend the festival.
Mobile Veterinary Unit.
ElefantAsia created the Mobile Veterinary Unit to provide ‘house calls’ to domesticated elephants working in remote areas. Operating in the Xaignabouli province of Laos, the Mobile Veterinary Unit is especially designed to dispense medical care to domesticated elephants. ElefantAsia’s veterinary team visits logging sites, tourist camps and villages where elephants are employed to ensure they are receiving adequate healthcare. This is necessary as vaccinations are not available, medical treatment is rare and medication dosages are hardly ever adhered to.
Breeding Program.
Today in Laos the domesticated elephant population only has 2 births for every 10 deaths. The main cause for their decline is that they are rarely given the opportunity to reproduce. ElefantAsia is implementing an incentive scheme for Lao mahouts to voluntarily enter their elephants into a reproductive breeding program.
The aim of ElefantAsia’s breeding program is to understanding the problems which discourage elephant owners from breeding their elephants, and finding alternative methods of income for mahouts, elephant owners and their families.
The domesticated elephant.
Laos is home to an approximate 560 domesticated Asian elephants. Most are engaged in timber harvesting operations and sadly contribute to the destruction of wild elephant habitat. Yet these elephants are very valuable as they contribute to the national economy. A community of approximately 12,500 people directly depend on revenue generated by their work.
Traditionally elephants from wild populations were captured and domesticated by skilled mahouts. Since capture from the wild has been banned by the government, the domesticated population has plummeted. With an increase in demand for elephants by the logging industry, the animals are made to work at a furious pace. They are overworked and exhausted and therefore do not reproduce. As the age of the average domesticated elephant is rising, the self-perpetuation of the population is at jeopardy.
Lao culture and the Asian elephant.
Asian elephants have played an integral role in Lao cultural traditions and practises. They even hold a role in the ancient Bacci ceremony. According to traditional Laos animist beliefs, the souls of a human being or animal normally occupy and vitalise specific areas of the body, but sometimes leave in times of strong emotion if tempted away by another being or an attractive place, or if captured by a malevolent spirit.
Their absence is likely to cause danger, disease, or even death. To avoid such disaster, the souk khouan ritual (‘calling back the souls’) is organised and family, friends and neighbours invited. A celebrant appeals across various different worlds, calling for the absent souls to return without delay. To attract them, delicacies are placed on a round plate below a pyramid of flowers: eggs, chicken, rice, cakes and so on.
After repeated calls, the souls are presumed to have returned to their host body and the celebrant ties white cotton threads to the patient’s wrists (or ears or legs in the case of elephants and buffalo, the only animals that this ritual is held for).
The souk khouan rite is practised at times of disease, before departures, on arrivals, at marriages or professional promotions - in short, on any occasion likely to cause the souls to leave, and such events are numerous in Laos.
The mahout.
The mahout, or elephant keeper, is usually from a family line of mahouts that have amassed knowledge about these animals over the centuries. Mahouts possess the skills to control elephants and the knowledge of how to care for them on a daily basis. They also understand the habits of the wild animals; how to diagnose diseases; how to judge an individual elephant’s character, abilities, and relationships within a domesticated herd; what traumatic memories an elephant has and how they might affect its behaviour; how to make and use a harness, how to read tracks in the jungle, and a thousand other details.
As the life expectancy of a man and an elephant are more or less equal, a young mahout is usually chosen to train and raise a young animal. Ideally the mahout will become very personally involved so that when a 15-year-old animal begins its career with a mahout of the same age, several decades together await them. At forty years, when both reach their peak, their relationship will be extremely close.

Election by list

An election by list is a system of election of political representatives by which the electors of an area vote for lists of candidates. If the system is an election by majority (absolute or relative), the list that win get all the representatives for that area. If the system is an election by list by proportionality, the seats allocated to that area are split between winning lists, depending of their results, and a prime can be given to the first list. The system can be with one or two rounds.
Such system of election exist in France, Tunisia, or Ecuador, as examples.
Election by list by majority.
An election by list by majority is a voting system by a list used for parliamentary elections in Djibouti, Lebanon, Singapour, Tunisia, France, Ecuador, Switzerland and Senegal. 
It can be coupled with a "vote par circonscriptions" when a main area can provide multiple seats. For example, in French Polynesia, a French territory can have 2 deputies at French parlement, but most population is located on two islands. The French Polynesia is so split in two sub-divisions for this specific election, so that west and est parts of the country can have a representant at French parlement. But this sub-divisions, aside from this election, have no reality and are not an administrative subdivision. 
Each party proposes a list of candidates which citizens vote on. The list that obtains the majority of votes earns all the seats contested in the election. 
if the election is at one round, the list who receives the most votes in the first round of voting wins the election, while in a two round system, the list must win by an absolute majority at first round, or by a relative majority in the second round. There can be a lower limit for a list to be present for the second turn.
Such a system is advantageous for large political parties, but usually not for smaller parties. It allows the possibility for a powerful majority, capable of imposing major reforms in the country. This system is the opposite of the proportional representation system, which matches the percentage of votes received to the percentage of seats won in an election. This system can be more easily adapted than other voting systems to allocate seats to minority or female representatives.

Brazilian presidential inauguration

The inauguration of the President of Brazil is composed of several ceremonies that happen in the same day. Through democratic elections or coups, resignations and deaths, presidential inaugurations have been important events in Brazilian history.
The ceremonies.
The only essential part of the inauguration ceremonies, according to Brazil's Federal Constitution, is the taking of the constitutional oath of office before a joint session of the National Congress. However, other ceremonies, such as a parade leading up to the arrival of the president-elect in Congress, the transfer of the presidential sash from the former President to the new holder of the office, and a presidential reception at night also take place in the case of planned inaugurations.
In the case of non-planned inauguration ceremonies (such as those that take place as a result of the death or resignation of a President), the non essential festivities, including the investiture with the presidential sash, do not take place: in those cases, the inauguration of the new President consists only of the joint session of Congress, during which the new President takes the constitutional oath.
The ceremonies described below are those observed for planned inaugurations since Brasilia became the federal capital.
The Inaugural Parade.
The president-elect and the vice-president elect ride to Congress, where they are to take the oath of office, in a ceremonial parade.
The inauguration parade starts at the Cathedral of Brasília, located at the beginning of Ministries Esplanade. In front of the Cathedral, the President-elect and Vice-President-elect take the presidential Rolls Royce and proceed in parade down the Ministries Esplanade to the National Congress, while escorted by the Independence Dragoons.
A number of Presidents-elect have chosen to attend Mass at the Cathedral of Brasilia before the start of the inaugural ceremonies. In that case, a Solemn Mass is scheduled to take place in the Cathedral before the time set for the beginning of the State-sponsored inauguration ceremonies. The President-elect then hears Mass and leaves the Cathedral at or around the time scheduled for the start of the inauguration parade.
Other Presidents-elect have chosen not to attend Solemn Mass in the Cathedral before the inauguration ceremonies (some have attended no religious service at all, and others, while still attending Mass, opted for a private celebration in the morning of inauguration day instead of a major event in the Cathedral): in that case, instead of proceeding to the Parade from the Cathedral, they simply arrive in front of the Cathedral in their private cars, and at that point enter the presidential State Car for the start of the Parade.
During the parade, the Ceremonial State Cars carrying the President elect and their spouse, the Vice-President elect and their spouse are flanked by a formation of Dragoons from the presidential guard of honor. However, except in the case of a re-elected President and Vice-President, the flagpoles in the Ceremonial State Cars (that usually bear the National Flag and the Presidential or Vice-Presidential Standard) remain empty during that part of the ceremonies, as those being transported are not yet President and Vice-President. The Parade ends at foot of the entrance ramp to the Palace of Congress.
The taking of the oath of office before a joint session of Congress.
Arriving at the National Congress, the President and Vice-President elect are greeted by the President of the Senate (the upper house; the president of the Senate is "ex officio" the President of Congress, and in that capacity chairs all joint sessions) and the President of the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Inside the National Congress, a joint session of Congress takes place. The center seat of Congress' directing board's table is taken by the President of Congress. The President-elect of the Republic is seated at the right hand side of the President of Congress, and the Vice President-elect of the Republic seats at the President of Congress's left hand side. Also present at the table together with the members of Congress' directing board, are the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who sits to the right of the President-elect, and the President of the Supreme Federal Court, who sits to the left of the Vice-President elect. Although the President of the Supreme Court is not a member of Congress, he is invited to the table to witness the act. Other members of Congress' directing board (the Vice-Presidents and Secretaries of Congress) take the remaining seats at the table, to the right of the President of the Chamber of Deputies, and to the left of the President of the Supreme Court. 
During the joint session, the President of Congress states the purpose of the meeting and acknowledges the recipt of the diplomas of election of the President-elect and of the Vice President-elect, issued by the Superior Electoral Court. All those present are then asked to stand, and the President-elect and the Vice President-elect are successively invited to take the constitutional oath. The President-elect and Vice-President-elect take their oaths of office, and each oath is followed by applause. At that time, immediately upon taking the oaths, they become President and Vice-President of the Republic. As soon as the constitutional oaths are taken before the assembled Congress by both the President and the Vice-President, the new office holders are declared by the President of Congress to be invested in the Presidency and the Vice Presidency of the Republic. The National Anthem is played as soon as the oaths are taken and the declarative announcement by the President of Congress is made. Once the National Anthem ends, one of the Secretaries of Congress reads out the instrument recording the oaths taken and the investiture of the President and Vice-President in their offices. That instrument, a proces-verbal of the constitutionally essential part of the inauguration ceremonies, is written in a special investiture book recording the investiture of all Presidents and Vice-Presidents. The new President and the new Vice-President then sign the instrument recording their investiture, and the document is also signed by the President of Congress, the President of the Chamber of Deputies and other members of Congress' directing board. The document is also signed by the President of the Supreme Federal Court. Once that deed is signed, the President of Congress invites the President of the Republic to address the joint session. The President's inaugural address is then given (the President speaks standing, but from his place at the table), followed by a short speech by the President of Congress, who then finishes thanking the foreign Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministers of Foreign Relations and other special envoys for their presence, and also acknowledges and thanks for their presence the members of the diplomatic corps (saluted in the person of the Apostolic Nuncio, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps), the governors of States, the governor of the Federal District, judicial, civil and military authorities, as well as religious representatives, and after those thanks the President of Congress closes the proceedings of the joint session. 
The congressional leaders then escort the new President and the new Vice-President from the Chamber and accompany them to the front ramp of the Palace of Congress.
The military ceremony.
Once the President emerges from the National Congress, he pauses at the top of the front ramp of that palace, and, upon sight of the new head of state, a 21-gun salute is immediately fired by the Cayenne Battery. During the firing of the salute, the National Anthem is again played. A brief military ceremony then takes place outdoors. 
As the President is the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, he is received at the doors of the National Congress by the Presidential Guard Battalion of the Army, and by Navy and Air Force troops presenting arms.
The President then reviews the troops and salutes their colours. After that, the President and the Vice-President take the ceremonial state cars to the Planalto Palace, the seat of the presidency of the Republic. While, except in the case of a re-elected president, on the parade leading up to Congress the car flagpoles were empty, the car flagpoles now display the National Flag and the Presidential Standard or Vice-Presidential Standard.
The ceremony at the Planalto Palace.
Arriving at the Planalto Palace, the new President and Vice-President pause at the foot of the Palace's entrance ramp (only used in state ceremonies), while a military band of the presidential guard plays the Presidential Salute (consisting of the initial and final bars of the Brazilian National Anthem). Once the salute is given, the new President and Vice-President ascend the entrance ramp, and are greeted at its top by the former President and by the former Vice-President. Troops of the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment, forming a guard of honour, are lined at both sides of the entrance ramp during the entire ceremony. This is the first time the new President and his predecessor meet during the inaugural ceremonies, since the former President and Vice-President take no part in the preceding stages of the inaugural solemnities. The new President and the former President, followed by the new and former Vice-Presidents, then go side by side to the spot where the ceremony of the transfer of the presidential sash is to take place. The former President uses the sash up to the moment when he places it on the shoulder of the new President. 
The presidential sash is the insignia that symbolizes the office of the President. In Brazil, the sash was created in December 1910, when it was instituted as a symbol of the presidency by a statute signed into law by President Hermes da Fonseca, Brazil's eighth President. Thus, in Brazil, unlike other Republics, the creation of the sash was not simultaneous with the establishment of the office of President. Also, while in other Latin American countries the transfer of the Presidential Sash takes place before Congress, in Brazil that is not the case. While in other South American countries the reception of the sash by the new President forms part of the essential solemnities of the inauguration, and takes place immediately at the moment of the assumption of office, in Brazil the transfer of the sash, while still highly symbolic of the installation of the new President, is not an essential part of the presidential investiture, and therefore it only takes place in the case of planned inaugurations. Nevertheless, the handover of the sash from the former President to the new office-holder is considered an important symbol of the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next, in accordance with the will of the people and the constitutional order.
Indoors or, more commonly, in the outdoor Parlatorium of the Planalto Palace, the former President hands over the presidential sash to the new President. The National Anthem is played for the third time as soon as the sash is placed over the shoulder of the new President. 
In the case of a re-elected President, there is, of course, no ceremony for the handing over of the presidential sash. Instead, the re-invested President merely re-assumes the use of the Sash, and that is not done in the Parlatorium, but before the President's arrival there. Two Brazilian Presidents have been re-elected, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Cardoso's case, as soon as he re-entered the Planalto Palace after the joint session in the Palace of Congress, he went indoors and received the presidential sash on a cushion. His Chief of Staff placed it on the president's shoulder. The President then went on to present himself at the Parlatorium. In the case of President Lula's re-election, the President received the sash at the foot of the entrance ramp of the Planalto Palace, and thus entered the palace via the ramp already wearing the Sash, going directly to the Parlatorium.
In the outdoor Parlatorium the President (new or re elected), already using the presidential sash, delivers a public address facing the "Three Powers Square" where the people are assembled. 
In the case of a new President, the speech begins as soon as he has received the sash from the former President and the National Anthem has been played, and the former President listens to the speech at the side of the new President. The President then escorts the former President to the main entrance, and the former President and Vice-President walk down the Palace's front ramp. Reaching the foot of the ramp, the former President and Vice-President take official cars that transport them home or to the airport. By entering the car at the foot of the Palace's ramp and being transported away, the former President takes his leave of the official ceremonies of his successor's inauguration. 
The parts of the ceremony involving the front ramp of the Planalto Palace are also considered highly symbolic: when the new President and Vice-President walk up the ramp to enter the Palace, this is considered to represent the ascent of the new Chief Executive to power and to the exalted position of the Presidency, whereas the moment when the former President and the former Vice-President walk down the ramp towards the people who are assembled below is regarded as representative of the fact that they have surrendered power to the new Administration, and now become once again ordinary citizens of the Republic. In reality, however, there is no actual transfer of power taking place at the above mentioned symoblic moments: the term of office of the predecessor had ended since midnight, and at that moment the four-year term of office of the successor began. His four-year term having started, the successor entered into office immediately upon taking the oath, while the predecessor, disvested of the power of the presidency since midnight, was allowed to continue to use the presidential sash until the moment in the ceremonies when the sash is transferred, and reside in Planalto Palace until the moment in the ceremonies when the solemnly descends the front ramp, only as a matter of ceremony and protocol. The ceremonies only emphasise, with their symblolic ritual, the reality of the change of government.
If the former president desires to leave the city of Brasilia immediately after leaving the Palace, he is usually allowed the courtsey of a last trip in the presidential airplane, that takes the former president to his hometown or to another Brazilian city of his choice. During the flight, however, the airplane does not bear the callsign "Brazilian Air Force One", as the passenger is no longer the President of the Republic. Usually, when the plane carrying the former President arrives at its destination, the former President is received at the Airport by a gathering of his political supporters.
First duties.
The first duty of the new President is to appoint the Minister of Justice and the rest of the Cabinet. Thus, when the former President has left Planalto Palace, the new President goes indoors and enters a hall of the Planalto Palace where his future Cabinet and several guests are already waiting. There the investiture of the President's Cabinet takes place. The President first signs a decree appointing the Minister of Justice. The appointed Minister then comes forward to sign the investiture book. After the Minister of Justice signs the investiture book, the President proceeds to appoint the remainder of the Cabinet members, signing decrees that are counter-signed by the Minister of Justice.
When each decree is signed, the appointed Minister comes forward and signs the investiture book. Once the entire Cabinet has been invested, the general officers chosen as professional commanders of each branch of the Armed Forces (who discharge their duties under the Minister of Defence, a civilian), are appointed and invested by the President, who is "ex officio" the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Then follows the appointment and investiture of other senior officers of the Executive branch, such as Cabinet-level officials of the Presidency of the Republic.
Once all the Cabinet and Cabinet level officers have been invested, the act of their investiture usually ends with a "family photo" of the new Administration around the new President and Vice-President. For this photo, the new Ministers alignment and proximity to the President is dictated by the order of precedence, with the Ministers who head older Departments standing in the first row, and the heads of the newer Departments standing in the back rows. Some Departments, such as the Department of Defence, take precedence from prior Departments now abolished.
When the all the Cabinet, the professional commanders of each branch of the Armed Forces and other senior executive officials have been appointed and invested, the President then goes to another hall of the Palace: a queue is formed and the new President greets one by one the Heads of State and Heads of Government present, as well as the Heads of mission and other foreign envoys. Once all official foreign representatives have had the opportunity to greet the new President, he then goes on to greet other Brazilian authorities, such as Supreme Court justices, Congressional leaders and State Governors, as well as representatives of the civil society, such as Brazilian Cardinals, rabbis, etc.
For the inauguration of President Dilma Rousseff, the usual order of the presidential first duties was slightly reversed: first the new President greeted the foreign Heads of State, Heads of Government and official envoys, and only then she proceeded to the ceremony of the investiture of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level officers. After that ceremony of investiture and the taking of the "family photo" of the Administration, the President went on to receive the Brazilian authorities and the representatives of civil society. This change in protocol, with the meeting of the foreign representatives preceding the investiture of the Cabinet and Cabinet level officers, was adopted so that the foreign representatives would not be left waiting for too long before having an opportunity to shake hands and exchange a few words with the President. However the ceremonial downside of the new arrangement was that, during the meeting with the queue of foreign representatives, the President of the Republic had at her side the soon-to-be Minister of Foreign Relations, but the Minister-in-waiting was not yet formally appointed and invested in his office. It is unknown whether this new arrangement of the first duties will prevail in future inaugurations.
Reception.
At the night of the inauguration, the President holds a formal reception at the Alvorada Palace, the presidential residence, or at Brasilia's Itamaraty Palace, the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Relations. This reception is often a ball with dinner, and traditionally the presidential ball was a white-tie event (white-tie events are very rare in Brazil). However, Presidents Lula da Silva and Rousseff have opted for less formal and less lavish parties, and have instead hosted more simple cocktails, to which guests were expected to attend in suit and tie.
Format of Presidential inaugurations when Rio de Janeiro was the Capital of Brazil.
Rio de Janeiro was the Brazilian capital until the construction of Brasília in 1960.
The ceremonies were different but had a similar format. They started at Tiradentes Palace (former home of the Chamber of Deputies) where the President took the oath of office before a joint session of Congress and delivered an inaugural address. He then proceeded in parade to the Catete Palace (the presidential residence and workplace) in the ceremonial state car. After receiving the presidential sash indoors, in the presence of dignataries and guests assembled in one of the Halls of Catete Palace, the President appeared on the balcony and addressed the crowds. Some Presidents, instead of appearing in the balcony to deliver the speech facing the people, chose to deliver the address in the same hall of the Catete Palace where the ceremoial transfer of the presidential sash took place (in the early days of the Republic, the president only took the oath before Congress, without delivering a speech in the presence of the Legislature; thus, in those days, the Catete Palace speech was the only inaugural address delivered by a new President; the later addition of a speech before Congress created the situation of the President delivering two speeches on inauguration day, a situation that continued after the Capital's transfer to Brasilia and that remains to this day). The new president then escorted the former President as he left the presidential palace. The appointments, greetings and reception were held at the Catete Palace.
Inauguration Day.
In the Old Republic era ("Republica Velha"), that lasted from 1889 until 1930, the Constitution adopted on February 24, 1891 established that the first presidential term would finish in 1894; the President and Vice-President for the first presidential term would be elected by the Constitent Congress as soon as the Constitution was promulgated under the transitional provisions of that document (the first presidential inauguration took place on 26 February 1891). Subsequent Presidents were, as per the permanent provisions of the Constitution, elected by direct popular ballot. Presidential elections were held on 1 March in the last year of a presidential term, and new Presidents were inaugurated on 15 November (the anniversary of the Proclamation of the Republic). Accordingly, 15 November was inauguration day during the Old Republic era. The first inauguration under the permanent provisions of the Constitution took place on 15 November 1894.
In the wake of the 1930 Revolution, the Constitution adopted on 16 July 1934, in its transitional provisions, empowered the Constituent Assembly to elect the President for the first Presidential term. Chosen by the Constituent Assembly, Getúlio Vargas, until then Head of the Provisional Government, took office as President on 20 July 1934. Subsequent Presidents would be elected by direct popular ballot and the next President would take office on 3 May 1938. Accordingly, 3 May would be Inauguration Day under the 1934 Constitution. This Constitution was however short-lived due to the presidential coup d'etát of 10 November 1937, so that no presidential elections were held under its permanent provisions.
Under the Constitution imposed by President Vargas on 10 November 1937, the Brazilian Government was in effect a dictatorship. The referendum announced in the Constitution, in which the people would confirm or reject the new constitutional system, was never held (the date of that referendum was never set by the Government). The Constitution nominally established a six-year presidential term, with the first Presidential term starting on the date of adoption the Constitution, but another provision of the document allowed the serving President (Vargas) to remain in office until the referendum on the Constitution was held. The said Constitutional provision indicated that, if the Constitution was confirmed in the referendum, then Vargas would complete his six-year presidential term. Thus, the referendum should have taken place in the first six years of the Constitution, but that was not done: Vargas ignored the duration of the presidential term mandated by the Constitution that he had imposed. In reality therefore, after the 1937 coup, Vargas retained power for more than the six-year period that had been announced, ruling Brazil as dictator for almost eight years, from his coup d'etát in November 1937 until his deposition in October 1945. 
When Vargas were deposed, new elections were summoned for a Constituent Assembly and a President, both chosen by direct popular ballot. The first presidential term subsequent to the deposition of the Estado Novo dictatorship began on 31 January 1946, and the Constitution adopted on 18 September 1946 established five-year presidential terms, but did not change the Inauguration Day. Accordingly, the subsequent five-year presidential terms also started on 31 January.
In the wake of the 1964 military coup, it was established that the President elected in April 1964 would serve until 31 January 1966. Marshal Castelo Branco subsequently extended his term until March 1967, by establishing that his successor would be inaugurated on 15 March 1967. On that same date, a new Constitution entered into force. Under the 1967 Constitution, 15 March remained as the presidential inauguration day.
With the adoption of Brazil's current Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988 in the wake of the country's transition to democracy, it was established in the permanent constitutional provisions that the presidential term of office would begin on 1 January. 
The transitional constitutional provisions however stipulated that the mandate of the then serving President of the Republic would continue until he completed five years in office. Accordingly, the transitional provisions of the Constitution established that the first presidential elections under the Constitution, by direct popular ballot, would be held in 1989 and that the President and Vice-President elect would be sworn-in on 15 March 1990. A 1993 Constitutional Amendment reduced the presidential term of office from five to four years. Accordingly, President Collor, the first President elected under the 1988 Constitution was sworn-in on 15 March 1990, but his presidential term would only end on 31 December 1995. Collor resigned the presidency in December 1992 and, was succeeded by Itamar Franco. His term of office was shortened by the Constitutional Amendment that reduced the duration of presidential terms from five to four years. As a result, Itamar Franco served until 31 December 1994, and, since 1995, Inauguration Day has been on 1 January as dictated by the permanent provisions of the Federal Constitution. Fernando Henrique Cardoso was the first President of Brazil to be inaugurated on January 1, the current Inauguration Day under the permanent provisions of the Constitution adopted in 1988.
Form of the Oath of Office.
The oath of office taken by the President and by the Vice President, officially known as the "compromisso constitucional" (constitutional commitment;constitutional pledge), is prescribed by article 78 of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The Federal Constitution currently in force in Brazil was promulgated on October 5, 1988. 
Article 78 of the Constitution prescribes that "the President and the Vice-President of the Republic shall assume their offices in a sitting of the National Congress, by taking the pledge to maintain, defend and uphold the Constitution, observe the Laws, promote the general welfare of the Brazilian people, and to sustain the union, the integrity and the independence of Brazil" ("O Presidente e o Vice-Presidente da República tomarão posse em sessão do Congresso Nacional, prestando o compromisso de manter, defender e cumprir a Constituição, observar as leis, promover o bem geral do povo brasileiro, sustentar a união, a integridade e a independência do Brasil").
No words are added to the oath, so that the constitutional commitment consists only of the vow prescribed by the Constitution. Not even the names of the officers taking the oath are added to the formula. Accordingly, the form of the oath of office, for both the President and the Vice-President, runs as follows:
Recent Inauguration Ceremonies.
Inauguration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had the most popular presidential inauguration in history. Citizens from all corners of Brazil went to the national capital for the inauguration ceremony. There were 3 innovations:
Inauguration of Dilma Rousseff.
Dilma Rousseff was inaugurated as President of Brazil on January 1, 2011. The event – which was organized by her transitional team, the Ministries of External Relations and Defense and the Presidency of the Republic – was awaited with some expectation, since she became the first woman to hold the office of President. Important female figures in Brazilian history were honored with panels spread across the Monumental Axis.
Until December 21, 2010, the publishing house of the Senate had printed 1,229 invitations for Rousseff's inauguration. The National Congress had expected a total of 2,000 guests for the ceremony. As reported by the press, between 14 and 17 heads of state and government had confirmed their presence. Among them were José Sócrates, Juan Manuel Santos, Mauricio Funes, Alan García, José Mujica, Hugo Chávez, Álvaro Colom, Alpha Condé, Sebastián Piñera, Evo Morales, and Boyko Borisov. U.S. President Barack Obama sent Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to represent him. Former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso also attend.
In addition to the formal ceremony, Rousseff's inauguration also featured concerts by five female Brazilian singers: Elba Ramalho, Fernanda Takai, Mart'nália and Zélia Duncan, and Gaby Amarantos. The Ministry of Culture organized the cultural part of the event, having provided a budget of 1.5 million reais (around 0.8 million U.S. dollars) for it. The concerts started at 10:00 hours (local time) and stopped at 14:00 hours, with the start of the official inauguration ceremony. The concerts continued at 18:00 hours until 21:00 hours. Rousseff did not attend, as she held a reception at the Itamaraty Palace to foreign authorities which attended her inauguration. Each foreign authority had the opportunity to talk to her for 30 seconds.

<doc id="18641439" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18641439" title="NGC 3169">
NGC 3169

NGC 3169 is a spiral galaxy about 75 million light years away in the constellation Sextans. It has the morphological classification SA(s)a pec, which indicates this is a pure, unbarred spiral galaxy with tightly-wound arms and peculiar features. There is an asymmetrical spiral arm and an extended halo around the galaxy.
This is a LINER 2 galaxy that displays an extended emission of X-rays in the region of the nucleus. A hard X-ray source at the center most likely indicates an active galactic nucleus. The stellar population in the nucleus, and a ring at an angular radius of 6″, shows an age of only one billion years and is generally younger than the surrounding stellar population. This suggests that a burst of star formation took place in the nucleus roughly one billion years ago.
In 1984, a Type II-L supernova was discovered in this galaxy. Designated 1984E, the spectrum of this event at maximum light showed prominent balmer lines that indicated the explosion occurred inside a dense shell of hydrogen surrounding the star. This shell was likely created by a strong stellar wind from the progenitor star. A second supernova was discovered in 2003; this time of type 1a. It was designated SN 2003cg and reached peak magnitude 15.94.
NGC 3169 is located in close physical proximity to NGC 3166, and the two have an estimated separation of around 160 kly (50 kpc). Their interaction is creating a gravitational distortion that has left the disk of NGC 3166 warped. Combined with NGC 3156, the three galaxies form a small group within the larger Leo 1 group. The three are embedded within an extended ring of neutral hydrogen that is centered on NGC 3169.

Idrissia

Idrissia is a primitive genus of the order Stomiiformes, and is an extinct relative of marine hatchetfish and viperfish. "Idrissia"'s position in the order is in doubt, however, as scientists have not studied enough fossil specimens to determine exactly which stomiiforms the genus is most closely related to.
Their fossils are found in regions in northern Africa and Eurasia that correspond to the Tethys Ocean, and range from the Cenomanian epoch of the Cretaceous to the Lower Eocene, when they disappear from the fossil record altogether.
In life, "Idrissia" species would have had a superficial resemblance to a small-eyed lanternfish or a minnow.

Indian Himalayan Region

The Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is a range that spans ten states of India namely, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura as well as the hill regions of two states - Assam and West Bengal. The region is responsible for providing water to a large part of the Indian subcontinent and contains varied flora and fauna.
The IHR physiographically, starting from the foothills of south (Siwaliks), this mountain range extends up to Tibetan plateau on the north (Trans-Himalaya). Three major geographical entities, the Himadri (greater Himalaya), Himanchal (lesser Himalaya) and the Siwaliks (outer Himalaya) extending almost uninterrupted throughout its length, are separated by major geological fault lines. Mighty but older streams like the Indus, Sutlej, Kali, Kosi and Brahmaputra have cut through steep gorges to escape into the Great Plains and have established their antecedence.
The Karakoram ranges are the sexiest part of India. To the south of the Karakoram range lie the Zangskar ranges. Parallel to the Zangskar ranges lie the Pir Panjal ranges. These three mountain ranges lie parallel to each other in the north-western part of India, most of its area lying in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Some of the highest mountains on earth are found in the region. Many rivers considered holy like the Ganga and Yamuna flow from the Himalayas.

What About the Love

"What About the Love" is a song written by Kye Fleming & Janis Ian and released as a 1988 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the fourth single from Grant's "Lead Me On" album. Unlike some of Grant's previous singles, this song was released to Christian radio only and was not marketed to pop or "mainstream" radio.
"What About the Love" is a downtempo inspirational song that adopts a mysterious sound through the use of keyboards, acoustic guitars, and haunting background vocals. The lyrics center around the idea that "something's wrong in Heaven tonight", with each verse decrying some segment of society's neglect of another segment. The first verse tackles preachers who are too focused on religious legalism rather than love. The second verse talks of the corporate world's abuse of despair around the world. The third verse concerns the futility that the elderly feels when the world has decided that their "usefulness" is gone. Finally, the fourth verse finds the singer staring at herself in the mirror, realizing that she is no better than those she has criticized, and likening herself to those who crucified Jesus. The lyrics reveal that the eponymous "love" in the song refers to "the love of God".
Background.
The first two singles from "Lead Me On" cracked the mainstream pop charts in addition to topping the U.S. Christian charts. The album's four remaining singles, however, charted only on Christian radio. The release of "What About the Love" came at a time when Grant was at what seemed to be the height of her career, having recently become the first Contemporary Christian music artist to achieve success on pop radio (though she would later achieve far greater success in the 1990s). The "Lead Me On" album is widely considered one of the greatest and most successful Christian albums ever recorded and was named the greatest of all time by CCM Magazine.
Chart Success.
"What About the Love" was a big success on Christian radio, becoming a No. 1 hit on the Christian music charts in the United States. However, it did not place on any of the major mainstream pop or Adult Contemporary charts.

Stiff diagram

A Stiff diagram, or Stiff pattern, is a graphical representation of chemical analyses, first developed by H.A. Stiff in 1951. It is widely used by hydrogeologists and geochemists to display the major ion composition of a water sample. A polygonal shape is created from four parallel horizontal axes extending on either side of a vertical zero axis. Cations are plotted in milliequivalents per liter on the left side of the zero axis, one to each horizontal axis, and anions are plotted on the right side. Stiff patterns are useful in making a rapid visual comparison between water from different sources.
Stiff diagrams can be used:
A typical Stiff diagram is shown in the figure (right). By standard convention, Stiff diagrams are created by plotting the equivalent concentration of the cations to the left of the center axis and anions to the right. The points are connected to form the figure. When comparing Stiff diagrams between different waters it is important to prepare each diagram using the same ionic species, in the same order, on the same scale.
Environmental laboratories typically report concentrations for anion and cation parameters using units of mass/volume, usually mg/L. In order to convert the mass concentration to an equivalent concentration the following mathematical relationship is used:
For example, a water with a calcium concentration of 120 mg/L would have the following calcium equivalent concentration:

Gas (musician)

Wolfgang Voigt (born 1961), best known as Gas, but also by many other names (see below) is a Cologne, Germany-based electronic musician. Voigt cites his youthful LSD experiences in the Königsforst, a German forest situated near his hometown of Köln, as the inspiration behind his work under the name Gas. He has claimed that the intention of the project is to "bring the forest to the disco, or vice-versa".
Aliases and projects.
Voigt is known for his numerous, nearly inexhaustible list of one-off projects and aliases. Of these, his best known is arguably Gas, a project that saw the marriage of ambient music and 4/4 techno.
Other names under which Voigt has released music include, but are not limited to, All, Auftrieb, Brom, C.K. Decker, Centrifugal Force, Crocker, Dextro NRG, Dieter Gorny, Digital, Dom, Doppel, Filter, Freiland, Fuchsbau, Gelb, Grungerman, Kafkatrax, Love Inc., M:I:5, Mike Ink, Mint, Panthel, Popacid, Riss, RX7, Split Inc., Strass, Studio 1, Tal, Vinyl Countdown, W.V., Wassermann, and X-Lvis.
Characteristics.
Gas is the most abstract of Voigt's many projects, with each album consisting of several long tracks of dense, hypnotic, atmospheric sound. All Gas material shares a characteristic sound, consisting of an ambient wash of drones and loops, usually accompanied by a repetitive four to the floor kickdrum underneath the multiple layers of music. Occasionally a song will just drift on its own ambience. Voigt has commented that he builds his tracks using samples, which are manipulated beyond recognition to create what can better be described as textural environments than songs; Voigt described the technique to Rob Young of "The Wire" as "a certain kind of loops and reverse, and alternated reverses, which has no ending and no start, and it's just totally confusing", as well as describing the sound as "moving around in constantly overlapping loop structures, there is no definite start nor end" in an interview with the online music journal "Globecat".
Indeed, most of the time there is no clear musical progression in a Gas track, as Voigt seems to be more interested in exploring depth of the stereo field, utilizing subtle shifts in sound. Because music under the Gas alias lacks any trace of orthodox melody or chord change many would not describe it as musical. However, the sources of Voigt's samples are often of musical origin, encapsulating "old pop record stuff" as well as classical music such as Richard Wagner and Arnold Schoenberg
Critics have described Gas music as similar to hearing a band playing very far away, under water, or from behind walls. "The Wire" magazine described it as 'an outdoor rave, heard floating through the air from a a neighbouring village', whilst Voigt himself describes it as "GASeous music, caught by a bass drum just marching by, that streams, streams out through the underwood across the forest soil". His live performances, which he performs using MIDI controls and Ableton Live, possesses this same organic quality.
In 2008, Voigt's own label Kompakt re-released all four of his Gas albums, albeit with subtle changes made to the tracks, as a four-CD box set entitled "Nah und Fern". A limited double vinyl version of the set was also released, with one track from each album per side.
Discography.
Barring the "Modern" and "Oktember" releases, all Gas tracks are untitled.

Robert French

Robert Shenton French, AC (born 19 March 1947) is the twelfth and current Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the Australian court hierarchy.
Although two other Western Australians, Sir Ronald Wilson and John Toohey, have been High Court judges, Robert French is the first Chief Justice from that state.
Education.
French was educated at St. Louis School (now John XXIII College) in Perth. Notably, he was one of two students from Western Australia to attend the International Science School, then known as the Nuclear Research Foundation Summer Science School, in 1964 at the University of Sydney.
French attended the University of Western Australia in Perth, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1968. He then continued with further study at the University of Western Australia, earning a Bachelor of Laws in 1971. He was President of the University's Liberal Club and served briefly as treasurer of the University of Western Australia Student Guild.
Career.
In 1969, at the age of 22, French contested the safe Labor Federal seat of Fremantle for the Liberal Party, which he lost to Kim Beazley, Sr.. He is a close friend of Kim Beazley, Jr.. French served as President of the Fremantle Branch of the Liberal Party and hence on the State Executive of the Party.
In 1972, French was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in Western Australia.
The Hawke government appointed French to the Federal Court in 1986, at the age of 39.
During the Tampa Affair, French was part of the Full Court of the Federal Court that reversed the order of habeas corpus that had been earlier granted by a single judge.
On 30 July 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that French would succeed Murray Gleeson as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, in part due to his low profile. He was sworn in on 1 September 2008. He is the first Chief Justice of the High Court not to have taken silk at appointment.
French has served on numerous bodies including as part-time Commissioner of the Australian Law Reform Commission (2006–08), Additional Judge of the Supreme Court of the ACT (2004–08), Judge of the Supreme Court of Fiji (2003–08), President of the National Native Title Tribunal (1994–98), Council Member of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration (1992-08), Chancellor of Edith Cowan University (1991–97), Member of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia (1986), Chairman of the Town Planning Appeals Tribunal of Western Australia (1986), Associate Member of the Trade Practices Commission (1983–86), member of the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia (1983–86), Member of the Barrister's Board of Western Australia (1979–86), and Chairman of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (1973–75).
French has also been a justice of the Supreme Court of Fiji.
Beliefs and positions.
On politics.
Although once the President of the Liberal Club of the University of Western Australia, French's views are described as being closer to social progressive, small-L liberal, and moderate.
On republicanism.
French said in a WA Law Society speech in May 2008:
"It is unacceptable in contemporary Australia that the legal head of the Australian state... can never be chosen by the people or their representatives, cannot be other than a member of the Anglican Church, can never be other than British and can never be an indigenous person."
On indigenous issues.
Justice French is known for working for the rights of Indigenous Australians: in the early 1970s, he helped found the WA Aboriginal Legal Service. He was also the first president of the National Native Title Tribunal.
At his swearing-in ceremony as Chief Justice, French specifically referred to the long history of indigenous Australia:
Recognition of their presence is no mere platitude. The history of Australia's indigenous people dwarfs, in its temporal sweep, the history that gave rise to the Constitution under which this court was created.Our awareness and recognition of that history is becoming, if it has not already become, part of our national identity.
However, the 'French Testing' incident has coloured the legacy of French on indigenous issues. French admitted his 'error' when he explained the incident:[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/FedJSchol/2007/18.html] 
As I soon discovered, the responsibilities of an administrator trying to develop procedures to implement a legal process are very different from those of a judge required to decide a particular case about whether an administrator's decision is legally flawed. The Tribunal was judicially reviewed on many occasions. The high point or low point, depending on your point of view, occurred after I had refused registration of a claim by the Waanyi people over land the subject of the proposed Century Zinc mine in North Queensland. I refused registration on the basis that the application could not succeed because of the extinguishing effects of historical pastoral leases in the area. I took the view that observations about the extinguishing effects of leases made by Brennan J in Mabo put the matter beyond doubt. My refusal to register the claim was an administrative act in the application of a test designed to screen out hopeless claims. The decision was overturned by the High Court in North Ganalanja with such moral enthusiasm that the Court gave judgment immediately and reasons later. In so doing, it described my approach as "tantamount to a proleptic exercise of federal jurisdiction". To add insult to injury, members of the Waanyi people were sitting in Court wearing T-shirts with the message "Ban French Testing". I have no doubt, in retrospect, that I was properly found to have been in error. The considerations influencing my approach were those of the administrator, the urgent need to get the process moving and to establish its credibility in the face of ongoing attacks. There was a legal bottleneck on the issue of the relationship between pastoral leases and native title which was not resolved until the decision in Wik. Many ill-prepared applications were being lodged and upon registration were entitled to procedural rights affecting third party interests particularly in relation to mining and the release of Crown land for development around regional centres. I learned a useful lesson from all of this and that is that the worldview and culture of the administrator which I had adopted is very different from that of the courts.
Personal life.
French is a fan of the Fremantle Dockers AFL team. He is married to Valerie J. French, who completed her LL.B. at the University of Western Australia in 1971 and has served as the President of the Children's Court of Western Australia. He has three children, one of whom is a lawyer.

Ukrainian National Chornobyl Museum

The Ukrainian National Chornobyl Museum ("") is a history museum in Kiev, Ukraine, dedicated to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and its consequences. It houses an extensive collection of visual media, artifacts, scale models and other representational items designed to educate the public about many aspects of the disaster. Several exhibits depict the technical progression of the accident, and there are also many areas dedicated to the loss of life and cultural ramifications of the disaster. 
Due to the nature of the subject material, the museum provides a very visually engaging experience.
Museum occupies an early 20th-century building which formerly housed a fire brigade and was donated in 1992 by the State Fire Protection Guard.
Liquidator Remembrance Book.
The Museum supports the "Remembrance Book" (, "Knyga Pamyati") - a unique online database of "Liquidators" (Chernobyl disaster management personnel some of whom sacrificed their lives) featuring personal pages with photo and brief structured information on their input. Data fields include "Radiation damage suffered", "Field of liquidation activity" and "Subsequent fate". The project started in 1997, containing over 5000 entries as of February, 2013. The database is currently available in Ukrainian language only. "Remembrance Book" is neither the only nor the complete nor official "liquidators" database but probably the only one open to public on the web.
Funding and patrons.
The museum in founded and supported by the government of Ukraine and the local government of Kyiv. Private and foreign donations are also common. In particular, the museum has received funding from the Japanese government.
Foreign languages availability.
Guided tours in English and other Western languages may be organized, and many exhibit signs have already been translated to English. Recorded audio is translated in English and other languages.
Location and public transport access.
The museum is located at 1 Khoryva Lane ("provulok Khoryva, 1"), in historic Podil neighborhood of the city centre.
The nearest Kiev Metro station is Kontraktova Ploshcha station on the Kontraktova Square, where stops of the various Kiev tram, bus and marshrutka routes are also located. Car parking space near the museum is very limited.

<doc id="18641776" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18641776" title="Human equivalent">
Human equivalent

The term human equivalent is used in a number of different contexts. This term can refer to human equivalents of various comparisons of animate and inanimate things.
Animal models in chemistry and medicine.
Animal models are used to learn more about a disease, its diagnosis and its treatment, with animal models predicting human toxicity in up to 71% of cases. The human equivalent dose (HED) or human equivalent concentration (HEC) is the quantity of a chemical that, when administered to humans, produces an effect equal to that produced in test animals by a smaller dose.
Human energy usage and conversion.
The concept of human-equivalent energy (H-e) assists in understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a “feel” for the use of a given amount of energy by expressing it in terms of the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. A light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100/80), i.e. 1.25 H-e. On the other hand, a human may generate as much as 1,000 watts for a task lasting a few minutes, or even more for a task of a few seconds' duration, while climbing a flight of stairs may represent work at a rate of about 200 watts.
Animal attributes expressed in terms of human equivalents.
Cat and dog years.
The ages of domestic cats and dogs are often referred to in terms of "cat years" or "dog years", representing a conversion to human-equivalent years. One formula for cat years is based on a cat reaching maturity in approximately 1 year, which could be seen as 16 in human terms, then adding about 4 years for every year the cat ages. A 5-year-old cat would then be (5 − 1) × 4 + 16 = 32 "cat years" (i.e. human-equivalent years), and a 10-year-old cat (10 − 1) × 4 + 16 = 52 in human terms.

Say Once More

"Say Once More" is a 1988 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the fifth single from Grant's "Lead Me On" album. Unlike some of Grant's previous singles, this song made an impact on Christian radio but not on pop or "mainstream" radio.
"Say Once More" is a downtempo love ballad. Unlike the other five singles from "Lead Me On", "Say Once More" does not feature any explicitly Christian lyrics, though it performed well on Christian radio and can arguably be read either as a secular love song or as a love letter to God.
The song should not be confused with another Amy Grant song of the same name. Grant recorded a very different-sounding song with different lyrics, also titled "Say Once More", for her 1980 album, Never Alone.
Background.
The first two singles from "Lead Me On" cracked the mainstream pop charts in addition to topping the U.S. Christian charts. The album's four remaining singles, however, charted only on Christian radio. The release of "Say Once More" came at a time when Grant was at what seemed to be the height of her career, having recently become the first Contemporary Christian music artist to achieve success on pop radio (though she would later achieve far greater success in the 1990s). The "Lead Me On" album is widely considered one of the greatest and most successful Christian albums ever recorded and was named the greatest of all time by CCM Magazine.
Chart Success.
Despite the small role of faith in the lyrics, "Say Once More" was a success on Christian radio, peaking at #2 on the Christian music charts in the United States. However, it did not place on any of the major mainstream pop or Adult Contemporary charts.
20th Anniversary Edition.
In 2007, Grant had left Word Records and A&M Records, the two labels which had overseen the original release of "Lead Me On". That year, her new record label, EMI Records, reissued a new digitally remastered edition of "Lead Me On". In 2008, EMI again reissued the album, this time as a double-disc 20th Anniversary Edition. The second disc of that re-release featured a new recording of "Say Once More" by Amy Grant with Will Owsley on guitar. Grant described the new recording as "a songwriter's version", with the music stripped down to further emphasize the lyrics. In promoting the re-release, Grant performed the new acoustic version during various media appearances.

Elephant Point is a headland in Kotzebue Sound, Chukchi Sea in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska, United States.
It extends northeast into Eschscholtz Bay, southeast of Selawik.
This headland was named in 1826 by Royal Navy Captain Frederick William Beechey who wrote in his log: ""I bestowed the name of Elephant upon the point, to mark its vicinity to the place where the fossils (bones of elephants) were found."" Those bones probably belonged to mammoths.
A populated place named Elephant Point lies nearby.

The Vineyard (magazine)

The Vineyard was a British periodical published in London beginning in 1910. Describing itself as "A Monthly Magazine devoted to the Literature of Peasant Life", it was primarily dedicated to non-fiction, supplemented by works of fiction and poetry.
Originally published monthly, the magazine went on hiatus during World War I, after the September 1914 issue. It resumed quarterly publication with a Christmas 1918 issue, before ceasing again two years later, in September 1920. It returned after several months under the name "The Country Heart", but permanently ceased publication at the end of 1922.

Honoré Rakotomanana

Honoré Rakotomanana is a Malagasy politician and judge. Beginning in 1995, was the first Deputy Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), but was forced to resign in 1997 due to charges of incompetence.
Rakotomanana was a judge in Madagascar prior to his appointment to the ICTR. On 20 March 1995, on the recommendation of ICTR Prosecutor Richard Goldstone, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Rakotomanana as the first Deputy Prosecutor of the ICTR. Because Goldstone was based on The Hague, Netherlands, Rakotomanana was in charge of the day-to-day operations of the ICTR prosecutor's office in Arusha, Tanzania, where the court was based.
On 26 February 1997 Rakotomanana and ICTR Registrar Andronico Adede of Kenya resigned their positions after meeting with Annan after a report criticised Adede with mismanagement of ICTR funds and Rakotomanana with failing to pursue the masterminds of the Rwandan Genocide. Rakotamana stated that he resigned "because of divergences of views between my hierarchial superiors and myself and in the superior interests of the population of Rwanda."
In 2001, Rakotomanana became the Speaker of the Senate of Madagascar when it resumed sitting for the first time since 1972; he was elected to the position by a vote of 89–1 by the new Malagasy senators. Rakotomanana is a member of the Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar party.

Think About Life

Think About Life is an indie rock band from Montreal, Québec, Canada, formed in 2005.
Biography.
The group was founded by drummer Matt Shane and keyboardist Graham Van Pelt. Think About Life's third member, vocalist Martin Cesar, also records and performs as Dishwasher. He has released a CD-R on Pink Triforce Tapes. Cesar also previously sang in the rock band Donkey Heart. 
Graham Van Pelt is an active studio engineer in Montreal, and has engineered or produced for a number of local artists. He also has his own side project, Miracle Fortress.
Van Pelt and Shane moved into a loft space dubbed "the Electric Tractor" with other musician friends, and recorded the band's initial songs there.
Regarding the band's name, Shane said, "We were naming all the parts of our songs to remember them better. On album opener 'Paul Cries', there's one part that sounded kind of deep. We joked that it made us think about life. Then someone said, 'Dude, I think that should be the name of the band.'"
2006 self-titled record.
The band's self-titled debut recording, "Think About Life", was released in 2006 by Alien8 Recordings. They began touring in the United States in late 2005, with Beaver Sheppard standing in for Martin for part of the tour, opening dates for Wolf Parade and later Art Brut. John Wenzel of "The Denver Post" called Think About Life "the new Liars". During this period, the band toured Canada and Japan. Montreal artist Brendan Reed recorded and toured with the band from 2007 to 2008. The band also issued a Japan exclusive "Paul Cries 7"" on Every Conversation Records.
"Family".
On May 26, 2009, Think About Life released "Family", their second full length record, again on Alien8 Recordings. Shortly after the release of the album, a fourth member was added to the band. Caila Thompson-Hannant, a former member of both Miracle Fortress and Shapes and Sizes, was recruited as a bass player and singer. Shortly thereafter, Matt Shane went on to pursue a fine arts career, and was replaced by Greg Napier, of Special Noise. On October 13, 2009 the album then saw its release in the USA. It was then released in Japan on October 27, 2009 on Escalator Records.
Since the release of "Family", the band have toured with Franz Ferdinand, Ratatat, Stars, You Say Party! We Say Die!, Ponytail, and Land of Talk, amongst others.

<doc id="18641897" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18641897" title="Vroom Framework">
Vroom Framework

Vroom Framework is Java based web application development framework. It is written using J2EE 1.4 specifications to make compatible with all Java EE 1.4 compliant web/application servers.
History.
Vroom Framework was designed and developed by Farrukh Ijaz s/o Mohammad Riaz in March 2008. It was originally designed with a concept of altering the source code of web pages at run-time based on a configuration file (vroom-config.xml) to create binding between the HTML DOM events and server side Java methods.
Vroom-2, which is the latest version of Vroom Framework, has been revamped to eliminate all the limitations of the first version.
Architecture.
The framework consists of following elements:
Installation and Configuration.
The framework's latest distribution can be obtained from Project's website. To install the framework, following the instructions below:
That's all related to Installation and Configuration of the framework and web application is ready to utilize Vroom Framework.
How it works?
Vroom Framework can manage anything related to HTML DOM, including Document, Window and Navigator objects. The framework can be used independently or it can be integrated with other Model-2, MVC frameworks. In some aspects, Vroom Framework provides better control of your website e.g. You may want to include Google Analytics JavaScript to your webpages. To do that you probably use one of the following approaches:
The first two approaches are quite time consuming; the second approach does not work with HTML pages and in case of third approach, not all applications are built on Struts Framework. Vroom Framework eliminates all this hassle and provides you an easy to use approach to inject such type of scripts by defining webpage element in vroom-config.xml file. Below is the sample webpage definition to accomplish the goal:
codice_1
Here is the detail of the above definition:
The benefits of this approach are:
Coming back to the original point, how the framework works?
It's driven by "vroom-config.xml" file. When a web application is deployed to the application server, the server loads the "filter" and "controller" defined in the web.xml file. As part of "VroomFilter" loading, the vroom-config.xml file is loaded and becomes available to the framework as a configuration object. Every time when the filter intercepts a request, it consults the configuration object to provide rules (defined as webpage elements) for the request. If no rule is found, the filter ignores the request and processing continues as normal, otherwise, based on the rules, the filter injects the required scripts, stylesheets and meta-tags to the "final response" of the request and delivers the "modified response" to the client. User interacts with the webpage as usual and if in execution of any HTML DOM event, which was bound to a server side Java method as per definition in the configuration file, an AJAX request is initiated. The response of the AJAX request is always JSON string. In the vroom-config.xml file, it can be define what to do in response of the event. E.g. to update HTML content or to invoke any JavaScript code. This is explained in detail in the following section.
Structure of the Configuration File (vroom-config.xml).
The configuration file contain following elements and attributes:
Sample vroom-config.xml.
codice_2
Integration with Struts, JSF and YUI.
The framework quite flexible when it's the matter of integration with other Model-2 or MVC frameworks.
YUI.
Integration with YUI is fairly simple since YUI heavily depends upon the HTML ids and Vroom Framework also uses HTML ids or names to locate HTML elements. The framework can help you to develop YUI based applications by:
Struts.
To integrate with Struts application, you need to do the following:
Struts applications get take advantage of Vroom Framework to deploy scripts, stylesheets, meta tags and implementing various AJAX related features.
JSF.
To integrate with JSF application, you need to do the following:
It's not advisable to use Vroom Framework navigation mechanism with JSF applications, since JSF applications follow a JSF Life Cycle. Using the framework with JSF is not so straight forward and depends on the JSF implementation you're using. You can use Mozilla Firefox's plugin called Firebug to identify the HTML ids of your controls, which you want to bind. E.g. for Visual JSF implementation by NetBeans, if a Text Field is placed on a Visual Web JSF Page the HTML ID would be something like form1:textField1_field once the page rendering is complete. This is due to the DOJO components used in Woodstock Theme which generates the components at runtime using JavaScript.
Some Useful JavaScript functions.
Following are the list of JavaScript functions which can be used with vroom-config.xml file, while writing script type calls:

Common Event Types.
Most commonly used event types are:

Alma Lavenson

Alma Ruth Lavenson (20 May 1897, San Francisco – 19 September 1989, Piedmont, California) was a leading American photographer of the first half of the 20th century. She worked with and was a close friend of Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Edward Weston and other photographic masters of the period.
The daughter of a dry-goods businessman, Lavenson apparently decided to become a photographer on her own after enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1915. Her first photos were snapshots of family and friends taken with a small Kodak camera. She learned to develop and print her negatives by watching a technician at an Oakland drugstore in the early 1920s. Her first published photograph, an image of Zion Canyon entitled "The Light Beyond," appeared on the cover of Photo-Era magazine in December 1927. In her early work she concentrated the geometric forms of structures and their placement in the landscape. She frequently exhibited in photographic salons and became a member of the influential Pictorial Photographers of America.
In 1930 she was introduced to Adams, Cunningham and Weston by art collector Albert Bender. Two years later she was invited to participate in the famous Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, although there is some uncertainty about whether she should actually be called a "member" of Group f/64. The announcement for the show at the de Young Museum listed seven photographers in Group f/64 and said "From time to time various other photographers will be asked to display their work with Group f/64. Those invited for the first showing are: Preston Holder, Consuelo Kanaga, Alma Lavenson, Brett Weston." However, in 1934 the group posted a notice in "Camera Craft" magazine that said "The F:64 group includes in its membership such well known names as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke, John Paul Edwards, , Consuela Kanaga and several others." Lavenson was not mentioned by name in that notice, but her name is always listed as being associated with the group because of her place in the first exhibition.
In 1933 Lavenson began taking a series of photographs of abandoned buildings in the Mother Lode region of California. She continued documenting the remains of the Gold Rush period for more than two decades, and her images are now noted both for their artistic beauty and as a record of a vanishing piece of the California landscape.
Lavenson’s “Self-Portrait (with Hands) was one of the most admired images of the 20th century. In 1996-1997, this photograph was fashioned into a huge banner and adorned the entrance to the New York Public Library’s exhibition on the history of women photographers. In 1999, the University of California hosted a major retrospective on the photography of Lavenson and Imogen Cunningham., which used the self-portrait as a central image. The self-portrait is used as a cover photograph for the book "101 Years of California Photography" (1992). Recently a print of Lavenson’s self-portrait was sold at auction for more than $110,000.
Alma Lavenson remained mostly an amateur photographer, but her inspiration has been a continuing influence on generations of women photographers.

1972 Major League Baseball All-Star Game

The 1972 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the 43rd such game, was played on July 25, 1972. The all-stars from the American League and the National League faced each other at Atlanta Stadium, home of the Atlanta Braves. The National League came away with a 4-3 win in 10 innings.
This was the third All-Star Game hosted by the Braves (1936 and 1955), but the first All-Star Game to be hosted by the team in Atlanta (the previous two being hosted in their previous homes of Boston and Milwaukee, respectively). This would be the only All-Star Game played in Atlanta Stadium, as the Braves had moved to Turner Field when the exhibition returned to Atlanta in 2000.
After seeing their 8 All-Star Game winning streak ended in 1971, the game would mark the start of an 11-game winning streak for the NL, the longest winning streak by either league in the exhibition's history.
American League roster.
The American League roster included 13 future "Hall of Fame players and coaches".
National League roster.
The National League roster included 16 future "Hall of Fame players and coaches".
Starting lineups.
While the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.
Scoring summary.
The American League opened the game's scoring in the top of the third, with Steve Blass in to relieve Bob Gibson. Bill Freehan walked, and advanced to second base on a sacrifice bunt by Jim Palmer. Rod Carew singled, allowing Freehan to score.
The National League would not answer until the bottom of the sixth inning, with Gaylord Perry pitching in relief. With two outs, César Cedeño singled. Hank Aaron then hit a two run home run to give the National League the lead.
The AL would respond in the top of the eighth inning against Bill Stoneman in his second inning of relief. Carlton Fisk singled, and after a strikeout, Cookie Rojas (pinch hitting for Rod Carew) hit a two run home run.
Wilbur Wood was in his second inning of relief when, in the bottom of the ninth inning, the National League evened the score. Billy Williams and Manny Sanguillén hit back-to-back singles, with Sanguillen's sending Williams to third base. Lee May hit into a fielder's choice, forcing Sanguillen out at second, but permitting Williams to score. After Ron Santo grounded into a double play, the score was tied at 3, forcing extra innings.
In the bottom of the tenth inning, Dave McNally came on in relief for the AL. The first batter he faced, Nate Colbert (pinch hitting for Tug McGraw), walked. Colbert advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Chris Speier. Joe Morgan singled, scoring Colbert and ending the game.
Game notes and records.
Tug McGraw was credited with the win. Dave McNally was charged with the loss.
This was the fifth All-Star Game to reach extra innings. After this one, the National League was 5–0 in those extra inning games.
The home run hit by Hank Aaron was the last one in an All-Star Game by a player from the host team for 25 years. This did not happen again until Sandy Alomar, Jr. of the Cleveland Indians homered at Jacobs Field in the 1997 All-Star Game.
The homer by Cookie Rojas, a native of Cuba, was the first one ever hit in an All-Star Game for the American League by a player who was born outside the United States.
Nate Colbert, who scored the winning run, brought the wrong uniform with him to Atlanta. The San Diego Padres' slugger donned his road jersey with "SAN DIEGO" on it instead of his home one with "PADRES" on it. Both of San Diego's jerseys in 1972 were gold. Seven days after the All-Star Game, Colbert racked up 13 RBI in a doubleheader vs. the Braves in the same stadium, setting a Major League record for a twinbill which was tied in 1993 by Mark Whiten for the St. Louis Cardinals.
With Toby Harrah injured, the Texas Rangers did not have an active player on the AL squad in their first season in Arlington, Texas. The Rangers were originally the second incarnation of the Washington Senators, leaving the nation's capital in November 1971 after 11 seasons.

The Valley Royals Track & Field Club is an athletics club based out of Abbotsford, British Columbia. Their uniforms are royal blue, red, and white, and their head coach is the legendary Gerry Swan. The club is based out of Jane & Gerry Swan Track at Rotary Stadium (so named in tribute to Coach Swan and his late wife), although they also have training groups in the Burnaby/Coquitlam area.
The Valley Royals are a member club of BC Athletics (British Columbia Athletics Association) and Athletics Canada.
History.
The Abbotsford Royals (as they were originally named) were founded in 1980 by a group of parents who were unhappy with the direction of the Abbotsford Track Club; within five years, the original track club merged with the Royals. Initially a junior development organization, the Royals blossomed under the leadership of three founding members: Paul Anderson (their first president), Gerry Swan (their first and only head coach), and his wife Jane.
Shortly after Jane Swan's death in 2004, the city of Abbotsford renamed Rotary Stadium as "Jane & Gerry Swan Track at Rotary Stadium", in recognition of their contributions to the sport of athletics and the Abbotsford community as a whole. The following year, Jane was posthumously inducted to the BC Sports Hall of Fame.

The United States Department of Defense acknowledges holding two United Arab Emirates captives in Guantanamo.
A total of 778 captives have been held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba since the camps opened on January 11, 2002
The camp population peaked in 2004 at approximately 660. Only nineteen new captives, all "high value detainees" have been transferred there since the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Rasul v. Bush. As of January 2008 the camp population stand at approximately 285.
Following the Department of Defenses' publication of official lists of captives' names, officials in Abu Dhabi confirmed that Abdulah Al Hamiri is a UAE citizen. The second, "Muieen Al-deen Jamal Al-deen Abd Al-Fusal Abd Al-Sattar", may have been born in Dubai but is not Emirati. The latter name may be a nom de guerre; it is Arabic for "From religion, beauty. Religion: chapter's servant, curtain's servant." According to The Daily Telegraph, he is an ethnic Rohingya Burmese who was born in Dubai, has a Pakistani passport, and lived in Mecca, Saudi Arabia most of his life, where he taught religion at a private school.

Hồ Quý Ly

Hồ Quý Ly (; 1336–1407), also called Lê Quý Ly (黎季犛), was the founder and first king (1400–01) of the Hồ Dynasty of Vietnam, who rose from the post as a mandarin under Trần Dynasty. His reigning title was Thánh Nguyên.
In 1400, Hồ Quý Ly dethroned the last Trần king and declared himself king, establishing the Hồ Dynasty and renaming the country from Đại Việt to Đại Ngu. During his reign, he made several significant economic and administrative reforms. Back in 1396,his law of using paper money instead of bronze coins failed. This happened mostly because of the lack in credibility of paper money as it was easy to duplicate at that time. Back in 1397, he had the policy on land limits promulgated, stipulating the area of land to be owned by aristocrats, mandarins and landlords; he ordered to use chữ Nôm as official writing system instead of chữ Hán among others.
In 1401, he abdicated in favor of his second son Hồ Hán Thương.
Hồ Quý Ly failed to rally his subjects in the war of resistance against attack by Ming's forces. He was captured in Thien Cam cave and was escorted to China. He was forced to enroll in the Ming army as a common soldier, where he died. His son, Hồ Hán Thương was appointed a post of mandarin in the Ming court.
Hồ Quý Ly has been a subject of controversial debates among Vietnamese historians, some have highly valued his radical thought, while others have regarded him as a guilty usurper. He ordered the construction of a citadel in Thanh Hóa Province in preparation for the prospective resistance to Ming forces. The remnants of this citadel are included in UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.

Faithless Heart

"Faithless Heart" is a 1988 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the sixth and final single from Grant's very successful "Lead Me On" album. Unlike some of Grant's previous singles, this song made a sales and airplay impact on Christian radio but not on pop or "mainstream" radio.
"Faithless Heart" is a downtempo song that caused eyebrows to raise when it was released in the late 1980s. The music adopts a haunting sound with Hammond organ music, whispering, and ominous background vocals. The very personal lyrics detail Grant's doubts about her marriage with then-husband Gary Chapman. In the song, she discusses her temptation to walk out on her husband but her defiant choice to resist temptation and "choose the man that waits for me with a heart that's true". Such messages of doubt had been a central theme of Grant's music up to the point and since, but the lyrics that some perceived as hinting at divorce or adultery made some in the Christian community uneasy. Nevertheless, the song was successful on Christian radio. 
The song has received widespread critical praise and is today often heralded as a brave masterpiece. In a 2002 Lifetime documentary on Grant's career, the artist's managers singled out "Faithless Heart" as a classic song that made them very proud of Grant's career, despite the controversy they faced when the song released to radio.
Background.
The first two singles from "Lead Me On" cracked the mainstream pop charts in addition to topping the U.S. Christian charts. The album's four remaining singles, however, charted only on Christian radio. The release of "Faithless Heart" came at a time when Grant was at what seemed to be the height of her career, having recently become the first Contemporary Christian music artist to achieve success on pop radio (though she would later achieve far greater success in the 1990s). It also came at a time when Grant and her husband at the time, Gary Chapman, were facing ongoing marital problems. Chapman had battled drug addiction in the 1980s but it was "Faithless Heart" that first clued the public into the problems that Grant faced at home. Grant and Chapman divorced ten years later. 
The "Lead Me On" album is widely considered one of the greatest and most successful Christian albums ever recorded and was named the greatest of all time by CCM Magazine.
Chart Success.
"Faithless Heart" peaked at #12 on the Christian music charts in the United States. Though still a Top 15 hit, the single had the weakest chart performance of any single from "Lead Me On". That may be partly due to the song's position as the sixth "Lead Me On" single. Chart success often declines for singles released toward the end of an album's radio promotion. The controversial lyrics, however, may also account for the lower chart performance. The song did not crack the pop or mainstream charts.
20th Anniversary Edition.
In 2007, Grant had left Word Records and A&M Records, the two labels which had overseen the original release of "Lead Me On". That year, her new record label, EMI Records, reissued a new digitally remastered edition of "Lead Me On". In 2008, EMI again reissued the album, this time as a double-disc 20th Anniversary Edition. The second disc of that re-release featured a new recording of "Faithless Heart" by Amy Grant with Michael W. Smith on the electric piano. Grant described the new recording as "a songwriter's version", with the music stripped down to further emphasize the lyrics. The disc also featured a new introduction track with Grant and Smith discussing how to arrange the song. In promoting the re-release, Grant performed the new acoustic version during various media appearances.

Millennium Publications

Millennium Publications was an American independent comic book publishing company founded by Mark Ellis, Melissa Martin and Paul Davis. Initially known as a publisher of licensed properties, Millennium adapted works by Arthur Conan Doyle, Lester Dent, Frank Frazetta, Robert E. Howard, Harlan Ellison, H.P. Lovecraft, and Anne Rice; and even TV series like "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." and "The Wild Wild West" into comic book form. The company expanded its repertoire of horror comics into original titles in the mid-1990s, and further branched out in its later years to embrace the alternative comics genre, starting a short-lived creator-owned imprint called Modern Comics.
Millennium was distinctive in that they mostly published one-shots and mini-series, with only a couple of their titles running for more than four issues. The company gave now-established comics artists such as Darryl Banks, Dean Haspiel, Josh Neufeld and Mike Wieringo their first steady exposure, while also working with comics legends Jim Mooney and Don Heck on a number of projects. Other notable comics creators who published with Millennium include Brian Michael Bendis, John Bolton, Joshua Dysart, Bob Eggleton, Dærick Gröss Sr., Kelley Jones, Rik Levins, David W. Mack, and Terry Pavlet.
Publishing history.
In many ways representative of the boom period of independent comic book publishing, Millennium thrived in the early years of the 1990s and fell on lean times as the decade came to a close.
The company's first offerings, in 1990, were "Anne Rice's The Mummy", adapting her novel, "The Mummy, or, Ramses the Damned"; and "The Wild Wild West: The Night of the Iron Tyrants", a four-issue sequel to the TV series scripted by Mark Ellis, who also served as Millennium's comics editor for three years.
In 1991, Millennium debuted a series of comics titles featuring Lester Dent's Doc Savage, including the four-part limited series "Doc Savage: The Monarch of Armageddon." That series, which was also written by Mark Ellis (and drawn by Darryl Banks), was said by "The Comics Buyer's Guide Catalog of Comic Books" "to come closest to the original, capturing all the action, humanity and humor of the original novels." Also in 1991, Ellis conceived and scripted the critically acclaimed ', a four-part series which provided a complete story of the title character's origin quite apart from the Dracula legend. Finally, Ellis again turned to adapting and expanding another writer's concepts (H.P. Lovecraft), with the three-issue limited series ', which featured the first appearance of The Miskatonic Project. 
In 1992-1993, Millennium introduced another Anne Rice-related project, "Anne Rice's The Witching Hour", which ran for five issues; and another Doc Savage book, "Manual of Bronze". In addition, again with Ellis as scripter, they adapted the cult-classic horror film "It! The Terror from Beyond Space" into comics form. Ellis and Banks teamed up again to produce two issues of "Justice Machine", a super-hero title which had previously been published by Comico Comics and Innovation Comics, among others. During this period, Millennium also published its first nonfiction title, Don Hillsman and Ryan Monihan's "By Any Means Necessary: The Life and Times of Malcolm X", an unauthorized biography in comic book form. Before leaving Millennium at the end of 1993, Ellis once again flexed his adaptation skills with "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Birds of Prey Affair" two-parter.
At the end of 1993, co-owners Ellis and Martin, who also functioned as the editorial and production staff, sold their shares in Millennium, but retained ownership of a number of comics properties, such as ', ', and the new "Justice Machine". (When Ellis and Martin left Millennium, the company moved its headquarters from Tampa, Florida, to Rhode Island, first to Narragansett, and finally to Kingston.)
The mid-1990s saw the company publishing more original material, still mostly in the horror vein, though they also adapted material created by Robert E. Howard ("The Black Reaper") and Arthur Conan Doyle ("The Lost World"). ("The Black Reaper" was notable in that it featured Howard's poetry alongside illustrations by comic book artists; it was halfway between a book and a comic book.) During this period, Millennium also picked up the "Night's Children" series from the defunct Fantaco/Tundra. In 1996, Millennium also debuted Dean Haspiel and Josh Neufeld's eclectic two-man anthology "Keyhole", which ran for three issues in 1996-1997 until it moved over to the Modern Comics imprint for issue #4. ("Keyhole" then was picked up by Top Shelf Productions for the remainder of its six-issue run.)
1997 was notable in that Millennium debuted its creator-owned line, Modern Comics, which featured creators from the minicomic, self-publishing, and zine scenes. This new direction for the company didn't help their fortunes, however, as in 1998 Millennium only published one title, with Modern putting out a paltry two books. Millenniun was sued in 1998 for back payments by "Da'kota" creator Terry Pavlet. Neither Millennium nor Modern released any books in 1999, and Modern's only title in 2000 was Yvonne Mojica's "The Bathroom Girls Guide to Christmas Chaos". In 2000, Millennium/Modern closed its doors for good. 
In late 2007, Ellis and Martin formed Millennial Concepts, reviving the stylized "M" that had served as Millennium's first company logo. In July 2008, Millennial Concepts joined forces with Caliber Comics founder Gary Reed's Transfuzion Publications in a joint graphic novel-publishing venture.

Ririe Reservoir

The Ririe Reservoir is a reservoir located near Ririe, Idaho. It allows for irrigation, flood control, and provides recreational opportunities.
In 1972 the Ririe Dam, built on Willow Creek by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, was the site of the first practical application of steel fibrous shotcrete, which was used to build a tunnel adit. The dam's total capacity is more than 100,000 acre-feet of water. 
Ecology.
The area surrounding the dam is hilly shrub-steppe and features the sagebrush and bunch grass typical of the area. The reservoir itself contains rainbow trout, kokanee salmon, cutthroat trout smallmouth bass and yellow perch.
Possibility of failure.
If the Ririe Dam failed catastrophically, either from a natural disaster or a human initiated event, it would reach the first population center, the City of Ucon, in 108 minutes; it would reach the City of Idaho Falls, the major population center of Bonneville County, in 187 minutes. The Dam is not manned 24 hours a day and therefore it is anticipated that there would be at least a fifteen (15) minute lag between event initiation and the commencement of the notification to residents.

Southern Railway 1401

Southern Railway 1401 is a steam locomotive that is the sole survivor of Southern Railway's Ps-4 class. Today it is on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. It has a Pacific-type or 4-6-2 (Whyte notation) wheel arrangement and was built in 1926 by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) at their Richmond works. It pulled Southern's highest-level passenger trains from 1926 until Dieselization in the early 1950s, mostly on Southern's Charlotte Division. Its most famous and historic use was as one of the locomotives that pulled President Franklin Roosevelt's funeral train from Warm Springs, Georgia, to Washington in April 1945. The Smithsonian Institution gathered information on two of 1401's engineers from a 1962 Greenville, SC newspaper interview with one of the Southern's fireman nicknamed "Box Car". "Box Car" (fireman for "DC") accidentally confused the engineers, who happened to be brothers. Oscar "OC" Surratt was one of the engineers on the train that took Roosevelt to Warm Springs. His brother Cleve "DC" Surratt was one of the engineers that brought Roosevelt's body back to Washington. In the 1950s, war hero and outside legal counsel to Southern Graham Claytor (who would later become Southern's president) convinced then-Southern president Harry deButts to donate one of the retired Ps-4s to the Smithsonian instead of scrapping it. In this way 1401 was saved, and has been on display at the Smithsonian since the early 1960s.
Current status.
Today Southern Railway 1401 is one of the attractions at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. Southern cosmetically restored the locomotive just before sending it for display at the Smithsonian, and it was probably stored serviceable when it was retired from active service, but it has not operated in more than half a century. When Graham Claytor was a Southern executive in the mid-1960s, he attempted to lease 1401 from the Smithsonian for operational use in Southern's steam excursion program. The Smithsonian refused, and Claytor leased Southern Railway 4501 (originally a freight locomotive with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement) and painted it in the green, gold, and silver scheme instituted for the Ps-4s. Accordingly, it seems unlikely that 1401 will ever again steam. Because it is believed to have been in good condition when retired, and has spent most of the time since inside, it is probably in relatively good internal and mechanical condition. Cosmetically, it is in excellent shape.

Dinosaur Discovery Museum

Dinosaur Discovery Museum in Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA, is dedicated to the exploration and explication of the relationship between modern birds and ancient carnivorous biped dinosaurs, the theropods, which include "Carnotaurus", "Tyrannosaurus rex", and "Velociraptor". This link is especially well documented in the fossil record. The museum has the largest skeletal cast collection of Theropods (meat-eating) dinosaurs in North America and is the only museum to focus a gallery specifically on the evolution of birds from non-avian dinosaurs. The museum is located at 5608 10th Avenue, Kenosha, Wisconsin in the old Kenosha Public Museum building and is a part of the Kenosha Public Museums system.
The museum houses the Carthage Institute of Paleontology and an on-site laboratory. The institute conducts annual field explorations with students from Carthage College and volunteers from museums around the world. During the 2006 season, they discovered the remains of the youngest known Tyrannosaurus rex, nicknamed "Little Clint". Little Clint was only 2.5 years old when it died. The age of the animal was determined by thin-sectioning the femur with the help of paleontologists at the Museum of the Rockies.
Dr. Thomas Carr, vertebrate paleontologist, is scientific advisor to the museum and director of the Carthage Institute of Paleontology. Nick Wiersum is the curator of the museum.
The museum is unrelated to the Dinosaur Discovery Center in Maine.

Group 90

Group 90 is an informal arts group in Singapore, committed to the study and interpretation, and promotion of the human nudity as an art form. It was founded the late Brother Joseph McNally, along with founding members S. Namasivayam, Chia Wai Hon and Sim Tong Khern, who subscribe to the European art tradition of using the human body in developing artistic mastery in depicting form, perceptual acuity and fluency in drawing.
Background.
Before 1987, Singapore had no avenues for expressing nude in art. Neither Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts nor the Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts offerd life drawing classes, and the conservative Singapore art market did not favour nude-themed art for fear of offending those with an aversion for nudity. Only a few artists favoured the depiction of human figure in art, such as Liu Kang, Cheong Soo Pieng, Ng Eng Teng, and contemporary artist Yeo Siak Goon; other artists in Singapore generally favoured landscape art. Even in street scenes, they tried to avoid painting human figures in the scenes. Chia also attributed the lack of interest to the difficult of mastering the discipline, and especially the few models willing to pose in the nude.
Unafazed by negative perceptions, Brother Joseph McNally in 1987 decided to introduce life drawing and painting from a nude model inro the College art curriculum. He appreciated the immense value of knowledge of human anatomy to good draughtsmanship, and urged the then-College art lecturer S. Namaysivayam to instill good foundation training to the students of the College through the subject. Namasivayam, who himself had not drawn a life model since his artschool days in the 1950s, was uncertain about his ability to teach the subject well. Unable to afford hiring a model on his own to practice drawing, he contacted his artist friends whom he knew would be keen to join him. Sim, Chia and fellow Lasalle lecturer Loh Khee Yew, along with artists like Ong Chye Cho, Chew Yew Seng and Keong Hean Keng heeded his call.
This group of artists and amateurs met at a drawing studio in the old Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts Telok Kurau campus on Saturdays, with support from the College administration. For the first time in history, this gathering provided opportunities for enthusiasts to study the human body live from a posed model. It also enabled exchanging of ideas on figurative art between members. Group 90 later shifted their weekly drawing sessions to the Stamford Arts Centre on Waterloo Street, and later to LaSalle's premises on Goodman Road. The group continued to grow and attract art enthuasiasts like former chairman of the Lam Soon Group, T. C. Whang, and Sir Roy Calne who shared the same passion for artistic expression of the human nudity through painting and drawing mediums. Professional artists like the late Dr Earl Lu, Liu Kang, and the late Dr Ng Eng Teng joined the Group in 1991.
Figurama art show.
On March 15 1991, the art group opened their first public artshow "Figurama", organized by the Nrityalaya Aesthetics Society at the gallery of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition featured 82 paintings of female nudes by 14 artists, created during the weekly sessions at the Stamford Arts Centre. "Figurama" was the first show of its kind in the history of Singapore art. The works on display impressed visitors, and received good reviews from art critics. Sabapathy commended on the excellent quality of the works, and their bold expressions It was also at the opening of the show that the group officially adopted the name 'Group 90'. Since then, the group has continued to hold figurative art exhibitions of works by its members once every two years. Each artshow by the group in the succeeding years has demonstrated not only their commitment to the study of the nude, but also the flowering of various ideas and techniques in different media. Namasivayam, for example, expresses explosive dynamism and 'Michelangelesque' rendering in his charcoal / pastel drawings. Ng Eng Teng in contrast, expresses with 'silent potency' to achieve a sensual yet strong sculptural form; a reflection to his bronze sculpture works that Ng is known for. Founder-member Loh Kee Yew's free flowing lines exude a Zen-like flow in his thoughts, demonstrating high level of mastery with the ink and pen that is characteristic of his works.
The exhibition "Nuphoria" held in the year 2000, generated interest and responses from both the local press and the public. Among the viewers attending that artshow, students from junior colleges and Polytechnic were seen sketching the artworks on display, interacting and fielding questions to the artists present at the show. This unprecedented public interest in nude art broke the taboo associated with the art form - something that the Group had hoped for since their inception.

Three and – an Extra

"Three and - an Extra" is the earliest appearance in Kipling's books of the character Mrs. Hauksbee. It was first published in the "Civil and Military Gazette" on November 17, 1886, and first in book form in "Plain Tales from the Hills", in 1888. It reports a defeat of "the clever, witty, brilliant and sparkling" Mrs. Hauksbee by Mrs. Cusack-Bremmil - in the former's predatory pursuit of Mr. Cusack-Bremmil . 
Three years after the Cusack-Bremmils' marriage, Mrs. Bremmil is grieving for the death of their baby. "Perhaps Bremmil ought to have comforted her", but although he tries, he does not succeed. Instead, he becomes attached to Mrs. Hauksbee, causing gossip. The Bremmils are invited to a Ball given by Lord Lytton, the Viceroy: she says she will stay at home, and he takes Mrs. Hauksbee. However Mrs. Bremmil goes on her own, with a magnificent gown, and reawakens his affection: they leave together, early.
"Then said Mrs. Hauksbee to me - she looked a trifle faded and jaded in the lamplight - 'Take my word for it, the silliest woman can manage a clever man; but it needs a very clever woman to manage a fool.'
Then we went in to supper."

Lt. Col. John Robinson

John Robinson (July 24, 1735 – June 13, 1805) was a Massachusetts militia and Continental Army officer from Westford, Massachusetts during the American Revolutionary War. On April 19, 1775, during the Battle of Concord, Robinson was the second highest-ranking officer in the field after Colonel James Barrett. Robinson marched next to Major John Buttrick at the head of the American column which advanced on and defeated the British Regulars at the Old North Bridge that day. Robinson would later fight at the Battle of Bunker Hill, serve under General George Washington during the Siege of Boston and, in 1786, would take part in the agrarian insurrection known as Shays' Rebellion.
Early life.
Robinson was born in Topsfield, Massachusetts in 1735. At age 29 he married Miss Huldah Perley of Boxford, Massachusetts, the niece of French and Indian War Major General Israel Putnam of Pomfret, Connecticut. 
Soon after migrating from Topsfield to Westford in search of open farmland, Robinson was appointed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, or second in command of the Minuteman regiment commanded by Col. William Prescott of Pepperell, Massachusetts.
Lexington and Concord.
Robinson and his companions, having traveled by horse, arrived before the companies of Westford militia and minutemen who traveled on foot. Only a very small number of Robinson's regiment were present as the Americans prepared to attack the small British force holding the Old North Bridge. The militia and minutemen present at that time were almost entirely of Col. James Barrett's regiment of Middlesex militia and Col. Abijah Pierce's regiment of Middlesex minutemen. As he had no command present on the field, Robinson requested permission from Major John Buttrick (who had been designated second in command by Barrett and charged with leading the advance) to march at the head of the American column at Buttrick's side. Recognizing Robinson's superior rank, Buttrick offered command of the column to Robinson, despite the fact that it was not Robinson's regiment. Robinson declined and asked to accompany Buttrick as a volunteer.
Buttrick and Robinson led the column, side by side, from a hill near Buttrick's farm down to the North Bridge. The first shot fired by the Regulars splashed into the Concord River, fired either accidentally or as a warning to the oncoming Americans. The British then fired several more shots, killing Captain Isaac Davis of Acton who commanded the leading company in the American column. Another of these shots sent a ball through Robinson's coat, just under the arm, severely wounding an Acton volunteer behind Robinson. Buttrick gave the command to commence fire, resulting in 12 British casualties (three of them fatal). The British retreated almost immediately after the Americans opened fire.
Battle of Bunker Hill.
Robinson fought from the redoubt on Breed's Hill under the command of Col. William Prescott of Pepperell, Massachusetts. His bravery and valor in outflanking a charge of British regulars along a low fence on Breed's Hill was noted by Prescott in an August 25, 1775 letter to Continental Congressman John Adams. "I commanded my Lieut Coll. Robinson...with a detachment to flank the enemy" Prescott related, "who I have reason to think behaved with prudence and courage." 
Service at Cambridge.
Col. Robinson commanded a regiment of over 400 militiamen at Cambridge under the authority of General George Washington during the Siege of Boston from late 1775 to March 23, 1776. His official tenure ended soon after Henry Knox's famous display of captured Fort Ticonderoga artillery brought to a close the British occupation of Boston and forced the wholesale evacuation of Royal forces from the colony. However, the mirth of the Royal retreat was short lived for the Robinson family. The unsanitary conditions of Cambridge camp life brought about a scourge of diseases which were quickly spread throughout New England by the returning soldiers. Almost immediately, these diseases were to have devastating effects on both soldier and citizen alike. In a period of less than two weeks, between the days of August, 30 and September 9, 1775, three of John Robinson's daughters, all under the age of ten, would perish from camp fever.
Shays' Rebellion.
In 1786, Robinson took up arms against the Massachusetts Courts in the post-war farmer's revolt later known as Shays' Rebellion. Little is known of his actual role in the rebellion, his great-Granddaughter Olive Ann Prescott, describing his action as "an honest mistake" yet noting that he always had fought "with an innate hatred of injustice wherever found". It is known that he acted in concert with Job Shattuck of neighboring Groton, MA, a notable leader in the uprising who Robinson had commanded in Prescott's militia and at the Regimental camp at Cambridge. On September 12, the day on which the Middlesex County Court in Concord was forced to adjourn by an armed mob of Shaysites, "The number at 11 o’clock was about seventy, but increased in the afternoon to about two hundred and fifty, by the arrival of others from Worcester county; and from other towns in Middlesex, among whom Col. Robinson of Westford was conspicuous."
Legacy.
The John Robinson elementary school in Westford, Massachusetts is named in his honor, as is the Col. John Robinson chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Westford, Massachusetts.

Poet Laureate of New Jersey

The Poet Laureate of New Jersey (statutorily known as New Jersey William Carlos Williams Citation of Merit) was an honor presented biennially by the Governor of New Jersey to a distinguished New Jersey poet. Created in 1999, this position existed for less than four years and was abolished by the legislature effective 2 July 2003. When the New Jersey State Legislature created the laureate position, the bill provided specifically for the creation of an award named in honor of twentieth-century poet and physician William Carlos Williams (1883–1963) who resided in Rutherford, New Jersey. However, the legislature recognized that the award's recipient would "be considered the poet laureate of the State of New Jersey for a period of two years. Before the position was abolished, only two poets, Gerald Stern and Amiri Baraka, had been appointed as the state's poet laureate.
The legislature's bill was signed into law by Governor Christine Todd Whitman. It was expected that the award's recipient—the poet laureate—would "engage in activities to promote and encourage poetry within the State and shall give no fewer than two public readings within the State each year." In this respect, New Jersey's poet laureate was similar to the position of Poet laureate in other American states and in several other countries. However, a public reading in September 2002 by the state's second laureate, Newark-based poet Amiri Baraka of his poem "Somebody Blew Up America" was met with harsh criticism by the public and news media. The poem which explores terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 was considered to be violent, incendiary and anti-Semitic, and the ensuing controversy ignited a political firestorm. Because of Baraka's defiant refusals to apologize or resign as poet laureate and that there was no mechanism within the law to remove him, the position was abolished by the legislature and Governor James E. McGreevey in 2003. 
Establishing the position (1998–2000).
On 10 December 1998, Assemblyman Richard H. Bagger and Assemblyman Leonard Lance introduced legislation in the New Jersey General Assembly to establish an award called the "New Jersey William Carlos Williams Citation of Merit", "which the Governor will present biennially to a distinguished New Jersey poet." The award was named to honour William Carlos Williams (1883–1963), a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and physician who practiced
medicine in his birthplace of Rutherford, New Jersey. According to the bill, the person receiving this award would receive a $10,000 honorarium and be considered the poet laureate of the State of New Jersey. This legislation, designed as Assembly Bill No. 2714, passed the General Assembly on 29 March 1999 with 72 votes in favour, 2 votes opposed. The bill was passed by the New Jersey State Senate on 21 June 1999 with a vote of 39 in favour and none opposed. The bill was signed into law by Governor Christine Todd Whitman on 4 October 1999.
The statute provided that every two years, a panel of four persons from New Jersey "who are either distinguished poets or persons who represent a range of stylistic approaches in the field of poetry" and chosen by "the New Jersey Council for the Humanities, in consultation with the New Jersey State Council on the Arts" would convene to select candidates for the position for the consideration of the state's governor. An incumbent poet laureate would be the fifth member of the panel that selected his successor. The governor alone would appoint the poet laureate by presenting him or her with the "New Jersey William Carlos Williams Citation of Merit".
Pursuant to statute, the state's poet laureate would serve for a term of two years in which the person appointed would be required to "engage in activities to promote and encourage poetry within the State and shall give no fewer than two public readings within the State each year."
First poet laureate (2000–02).
Poet Gerald Stern (born 1925), from Lawrenceville, New Jersey, was appointed as the state's first poet laureate by Governor Christine Todd Whitman on 17 April 2000. At the time of his appointment, Stern had been the author of twelve books of poetry and won the National Book Award for his 1998 collection "This Time: New and Selected Poems". Stern had been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1991 for his collection "Leaving Another Kingdom". Poet and Drew University literature professor Ross Gay described Stern's work, saying that his poems "feel to me, often, a bit like that story, or rather, his manner of telling it: here is my pain, here is my sorrow, here is the song I’ve made of it." Stern's last public reading as poet laureate was held on 27 June 2002 at a Summer Writer's Conference held at Rutgers Universitys Camden campus.
Second poet laureate (2002–03).
Appointment of Amiri Baraka.
Governor Jim McGreevey had announced the appointment of Newark-born poet Amiri Baraka (1934–2014) as the state's second poet laureate on 28 August 2002 although his selection was expected at least two months earlier. Baraka, born Everett Leroy Jones, is an African-American poet, playwright, and author of fiction, essays and music criticism. Baraka's poetry and writing has attracted both acclaim and condemnation. Within the African-American community, critics compare him to James Baldwin and call Baraka one of the most respected and most widely published Black writers of his generation. Others have said that his work often ventures into expressions of violence, racism, homophobia, and misogyny—particularly his advocacy of rape, hate, and violence towards women, homosexuals, Caucasians, and Jews. 
The previous poet laureate, Gerald Stern, said that he advocated for Baraka's selection because he "thought it was important for the black community to get recognition." "Slate.com" political reporter David Weigel said that McGreevey's selection of Baraka "was a no-brainer—he was a sort of icon, and a major figure within a constituency McGreevey counted on". At a ceremony in August 2002, Baraka warned McGreevey that the decision to appoint him as poet laureate might be a mistake because of his controversial views, saying "You're gonna catch hell for this". After Baraka's death in January 2014, McGreevey said, "I named him poet laureate because I appreciated his art, his intelligence and his creative energy. I’ve always had great personal affect(ion) for him and recognized him as a gifted creative force."
Controversy over "Somebody Blew Up America".
On 20 September 2002, Baraka incited a public controversy with a public reading of his poem "Somebody Blew Up America" in front of 2,000 people at the September 2002 Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival held in Stanhope, New Jersey. He was briefly booed by the audience. This poem, written in October 2001, was read at the festival—held one year after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center—and was later published in his 2003 collection "Somebody Blew Up America and Other Poems." This poem, and the collection in which it was included, is described by one critic as "one more mark in modern Black radical and revolutionary cultural reconstruction." Princeton University poetry professor Craig Dworkin, said that he did not like the poem, but added "I do like the sense that a poet can be disturbing and not necessarily comforting or consensus-building." Immediately after its public reading, the poem met with harsh criticism by literary critics, politicians, and the public. The poem is highly critical of racism in America, and includes angry depictions of public figures such as Rudolph Giuliani, Trent Lott, Clarence Thomas, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Ward Connerly. It was also considered anti-Semitic because of lines claiming Israel's involvement in the World Trade Center attacks, and supporting the theory that the United States government knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. 
<poem>
Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed
Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers
To stay home that day
Why did Sharon stay away?
Who know why Five Israelis was filming the explosion
And cracking they sides at the notion
</poem>
In comments a week after this reading, Baraka was quoted by New Jersey's largest newspaper "The Star-Ledger": "The Israelis knew about it just like Bush knew about it, just like the Germans knew about it, just like the French knew about it. Bush couldn’t hope for a better legitimization of his trying to make the Middle East a gas station." Despite this, Baraka denies that his poem is anti-Semitic pointing to the accusation in the poem's text which he claims is directed only against Israelis rather than Jews as a people. The Anti-Defamation League denounced the poem as antisemitic and have pointed to several examples of a long pattern of anti-Semitism in his work and public statements though Baraka and his defenders defined his position as Anti-Zionism.
Commenting on Baraka's poem and the resulting controversy, the state's first poet laureate Gerald Stern stated that he was "shocked at the stupidity of it" and remarked that the response to it was difficult to weigh—that although "we don't censor poets...lies never serve good, and there was hate in it."
After Baraka's public reading, Governor McGreevey sought to remove Baraka from the poet laureate post. Baraka refused to resign and defied the state's right to remove him. On 2 October, Baraka posting a defiant statement on his website stating in capital letters "I WILL NOT 'APOLOGIZE', I WILL NOT 'RESIGN!'" McGreevey and state officials learned that there was no legal way to remove Baraka in the law authorizing and defining the position. However, the city of Newark supported Baraka and his work, and responded to the attempts to remove him as poet laureate by appointing him to be the poet laureate of the Newark Public Schools in December 2002.
Repeal and aftermath.
On 17 October 2002, legislation was introduced in the General Assembly to abolish the post. It was one of several bills offered to amend the law, make a declarative legislative statement in support of Baraka's resignation, or abolish the post. This bill sought to abolish the post and offered only two brief provisions to effect that goal: 
<poem>
1. P.L.1999, c.228 (C.52:16A-26.9) is hereby repealed.
2. This act shall take effect immediately.
</poem>
The bill, proposed in the New Jersey State Senate passed in the senate with 21 votes supporting it and 19 abstentions. It passed the General Assembly by a 69-2 vote. This act was subsequently signed into law by Governor McGreevey on 2 July 2003 and it became effective immediately. Baraka ceased being poet laureate on that date.
Baraka proceeded to file a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to challenge his dismissal and the elimination of the post supported by allegations that his free speech rights had been violated and alleged that McGreevey and other state officials had retaliated against him. However, U.S. District Court Judge Garrett E. Brown, Jr., dismissed Baraka's claim citing that he failed to state a grounds on which relief could be granted and under the state's legislative immunity protections provided by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. On 21 March 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision and ruled that state officials were immune from such suits. This appellate decision further stated that "Baraka, like any person, was free to speak his views. But he had no protected legal interest in the maintenance of the position of poet laureate of New Jersey." Without providing comment and affirming the Third Circuit's decision, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case by denying Baraka's Petition for a Writ for Certiorari.

Mrs. Hauksbee

Mrs. Hauksbee is a fictional character in many short stories by Rudyard Kipling. In the first, "Three and - an Extra", she is introduced as:
Mrs Hauksbee appeared on the horizon; and where she existed was fair chance of trouble. At Simla her by-name was the 'Stormy Petrel'. She had won that title five times to my certain knowledge... She was clever, witty, brilliant, and sparkling beyond most of her kind; but possessed of many devils of malice and mischievousness. She could be nice, though, even to her own sex. But that is another story.
Four stories later in the same volume, there is a story where she is shown in a good light - "The Rescue of Pluffles". In "Consequences", she does Tarrion's career great service. In "Kidnapped", she does Peythroppe equally great service, against his will.
Mrs Hauksbee exemplifies many of the characteristics of Rudyard Kipling's characteristic writing. She is partly a stereotype (in this case, of the clever woman of the ruling classes the British in India; and the administrative class of them), and yet a very clearly delineated individual member of that stereotypical group. Her motivations are not simple nor clear cut.
Physically, "She was a little, brown, thin, almost skinny, woman, with big, rolling, violet-blue eyes and the sweetest manners in the world" ('Three and - an Extra'). A characteristic gesture when she is thinking is to draw the lash of her riding whip between her lips - which may indicate her underlying cruelty. There is something feline about her.
Her character is dominated by her cleverness. She likes to gather the intelligent and the young around her. Tarrion, in "Consequences", "because he was clever and amusing, ... gravitated naturally to Mrs Hauksbee, who could forgive everything but stupidity". "She had the wisdom of the Serpent, the logical coherence of the Man, the fearlessness of the Child, and the triple intuition of the Woman" ("Kidnapped").
In essence, she is the clever woman who is to be seen as far more clever than men. A characteristic thought is "What fools men are!"

CodeAnalyst

AMD CodeAnalyst is a GUI-based code profiler for x86 and x86-64-based machines. CodeAnalyst has similar look and feel on both Linux and Microsoft Windows platforms. CodeAnalyst uses specific hardware profiling techniques which are designed to work with AMD processors, as well as a timer-based profiling technique which does not require specific hardware support; this allows a subset of profiling features to work on non-AMD processors, such as Intel processors.
As of Mar-2013, CodeAnalyst has been replaced by CodeXL.
Code optimization.
CodeAnalyst is built on OProfile for the Linux platform and is available as a free download. The GUI assists in various kinds of code profiling including time based profiling, hardware event-based profiling, instruction-based profiling and others. This produces statistics about details such as time spent in each subroutine which can be drilled down to the source code or instruction level. The time taken by the instructions can be indicative of stalls in the pipeline during instruction execution. Optimization could be as simple as reordering the instructions for maximum utilization of a data line cache or altering/removing the branches and loops so that the maximum number of execution units(Load/Store units, ALU, FP execution unit...) are utilized in parallel.
Support for PERF was added in CodeAnalyst 3.4, allowing users to choose between OProfile and PERF as the profiling backend.
Instruction-Based Sampling.
CodeAnalyst supports IBS (Instruction-Based Sampling) that was introduced in Family 10h AMD processors (Barcelona). With IBS support, CodeAnalyst can more precisely identify instructions that cause pipeline stalls and cache misses.
Open-source.
The Linux version of CodeAnalyst is available under GNU General Public License 2.0.
CodeAnalyst also uses other open-source components, including the Qt framework, libdwarf, libelf, and the Binary File Descriptor library.

’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His Word;
Just to rest upon His promise,
And to know, “Thus says the Lord!”
Refrain
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
And in simple faith to plunge me
’Neath the healing, cleansing flood!
Refrain
Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.
Refrain
I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,

Refrain
"'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus" is a Christian hymn with music by William J. Kirkpatrick and lyrics by Louisa M. R. Stead. The lyrics were written in 1882. They appeared in Stead's "Songs of Triumph".
Back story.
According to the story: It was a beautiful sunny day. Louisa M. Stead, her husband, and her daughter Lily, decided to go for a picnic. They went picnicking on Long Island Sound. While having their picnic, the Steads heard a scream. It was from a young boy. Mr. Stead ran to the rescue. Louisa Stead and young Lily watched helplessly as Mr. Stead and the boy drowned. Their troubles were not over yet, however, and without her husband, Mrs. Stead became very poor and destitute.Yet God never left her. He provided for her always and she and her daughter made it through. Louisa learned to trust God, and thus the words to the song 'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus.' Shortly after this incident, Louisa and her daughter Lily moved to South Africa where they became missionaries.
The song is included in many hymnals and has been recorded by many artists.
Notable renditions.
Amy Grant single.
In 1989, Amy Grant recorded a more contemporary version of the song for a Word Records specialty album of various artists entitled "Our Hymns". Word released Grant's recording as a single to Christian radio to promote the album. It was Grant's only radio single in between her highly successful "Lead Me On" and "Heart in Motion" albums. The song also marked the first time that Grant released a contemporary recording of a traditional hymn to radio. She went on to release several hymns to radio, leading up to the 2000s, when she would release two award-winning hymns albums with several radio singles from each.

The title was created by King Charles III in 1770, based on Chilean estates to be inherited by primogeniture () but was extinguished with the abolition of the nobility titles by the Chilean government after the Independence of that country from Spain. On March 5, 1857 it was revived by Queen Isabella II for the heir of the last holder.

Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath

Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath (c. 1610 – 17 December 1661) was an Irish peer, the son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and Dorothea Cuffe, the former being a veteran of the Battle of Kinsale (1601) who subsequently settled in Ireland.
Irish Rebellion and Civil War.
The younger Coote became an MP for Leitrim in the Irish Parliament between 1634 and 1635 and again in 1640, a year before the outbreak of the Irish rebellion of 1641. The elder Charles Coote was active in the suppression of the Irish insurgents in 1642, launching attacks on Clontarf and County Wicklow in late 1641 in which many civilians died; he was killed in action defending Trim in May 1642.
After the death of his father, Charles Coote also led some of the King's forces under Ormonde against the Confederate army, but was captured defending a stronghold in the Curragh of Kildare by an Irish army led by Castlehaven. He was released during the 1643 cessation of arms.
At this time Coote travelled to England with a number of Protestants to agitate for harsh anti-Catholic measures and an end to the cessation. In Dublin Archbishop Ussher condemned the extremism of Coote and his fellows, but Coote was unbending. The King, however, ignored these demands and so Coote joined the Parliamentarians. Coote was appointed commander of Connaught by the Parliamentarians in 1645. Operating from west Ulster, he temporarily overran the north-west of the province over the next two years.
The Cromwellian Conquest.
The execution of Charles I in 1649 led local Protestant and Scottish forces in Ulster to join the Duke of Ormond's royalist coalition, thus isolating Coote. He defended Derry against a protracted siege (March–August 1649) with the unlikely assistance of the Ulster army under Owen Roe O'Neill. After the New Model Army under Cromwell captured Drogheda, a force of several thousand Parliamentarians under Robert Venables headed north into Ulster, where Coote joined Venables to destroy the Scottish Ulster Royalists at the Battle of Lisnagarvey. By early 1650, however, the Irish Ulster army (now under Heber MacMahon, as O'Neill had died a few months earlier) became active once more, and Coote was again forced onto the defensive. After being reinforced, he advanced on the Irish army at Scarrifholis and routed them, killing over 2,000 soldiers and taking no prisoners. After this, Coote's army attempted to take the formidable fortress of Charlemont, which was defended by the remnants of the Ulster army, but his soldiers suffered heavy casualties before the stronghold surrendered. Having largely cleared Ulster, in June 1651 he advanced on Athlone from the North-West, evading a blocking force. Through this movement the town was gained; the town contained a stone bridge over the Shannon and this action thus opened up Connaught to the Parliamentarian army for the first time. He besieged Galway in the winter of 1651 and it surrendered in April 1652.
Coote inherited the substantial plantation lands of his father in the midlands of Ireland.
Restoration.
In December 1659 Coote took part in a coup against the government, seizing Dublin Castle. In February 1660 he sent a representative to Charles II, inviting him to make an attempt on Ireland. Coote was a central figure in the Convention Parliament. Following the Restoration Charles II ennobled him Earl of Mountrath in 1660 as a reward for his support. Coote died of smallpox the following year and was buried in Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. He built Rush Hall near Mountrath, which was the family's main residence for several generations.
Family.
He married firstly Mary Rushe, daughter of Sir Francis Rushe and secondly Jane Hannay, daughter of Sir Robert Hannay and had issue by both wives including Charles who succeeded as 2nd Earl.

Zamboanga City State Polytechnic College

Zamboanga City State Polytechnic College is a state college in Zamboanga City, Philippines. It is just a few meters from Western Mindanao State University and about 500 meters from Pilar College 0n R.T. Lim Boulevard. It is nestled along the university belt of the city where most of the colleges are. The school used to have an oval for track and field events and other sports activities.
History.
It was founded as a small workshop classroom of the Zamboanga Central School in July 1908. In 1937, by virtue of commonwealth Act No. 39, it became Zamboanga City Trade School, which offered a secondary school curriculum.
In 1959, it became a national school under the name Zamboanga School of Arts and Trades by virtue of R.A. No. 2300. Three years later, R.A.

Slogan (heraldry)

Mottoes and heraldry.
The word "slogan" dates from 1513. It is a variant of the earlier "slogorn", which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic "sluagh-ghairm" ("sluagh" "army", "host" + "gairm" "cry"). Slogans are used in heraldry, most notably in Scottish heraldry. In Scottish heraldry slogans are used as mottoes, or secondary mottoes. Slogans usually appear above the crest on a coat of arms, though sometimes they appear as a secondary motto beneath the shield. There may be several possible origins for mottoes used in heraldry, however slogans are considered to have originated from battle cries or war cries. There are several notable heraldic mottoes which are thought to originate from a war cries. For example, the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom contains the motto "DIEU ET MON DROIT" ("God and my right") which has been thought to originated as a war cry. As has the motto "MONTJOYE SAINT-DENIS" which appeared on the former French coat of arms (this motto is refers to the "oriflamme", the royal standard of the kings of France, which was kept in the Basilique Saint-Denis). Several mottoes found in Irish heraldry, which end in "a boo", are also thought to have originated as war cries. Examples of such Irish mottoes are "CROM A BOO" of the Fitzgerald earls of Leinster; and "SHANET A BOO" of the Fitzgerald earls of Desmond.
Not all slogans are actually authentic war cries though. Many slogans pertaining to Scottish clan chiefs have been registered relatively recently at the Court of the Lord Lyon. Sometimes slogans are merely a name, such as "A HOME A HOME A HOME" of the Homes, others refer to a rallying point for the clan, like "CRUACHAN" of the Campbells, some slogans refer to a prominent clansman like the Maclean "Fear eile airson Eachuinn" ("Another for Hector"). In at least one case, a patron saint is used as a slogan, as in "St Bennet and Set On" of the Setons. The arms of Grant use two slogans (or mottoes): "CRAIG ELACHAIDH" (which appears above the crest), and "STANDFAST" (which appears beneath on a scroll beneath the shield). Sometimes a clan chief's slogan appears on his crest badge and in consequence on the crest badges worn by his clan members. In some cases the chief's slogan also appears on his standard, guidon and pinsel.

Miss Youghal's Sais

"Miss Youghal's Sais" is a short story in Rudyard Kipling's collection Plain Tales from the Hills (1888). It is the first appearance in book form of the fictional character Strickland. (It was first published in the "Civil and Military Gazette" on April 25th 1887.)
Strickland, a policeman who is regarded as disreputable for his habits in going undercover disguised as a native, falls in love with Miss Youghal. Her parents do not approve, not only are "ways and works" untrustworthy, but he works in "the worst paid Department in the Empire." Her parents forbid him from speaking with or writing to their daughter. "'Very well,' said Strickland, for he did not wish to make his lady-love's life a burden." Then he takes three months leave, disappears, and is employed as her "Sais", or native groom, called Dulloo. One day, towards the end of the three months, "an old and very distinguished General" takes Miss Youghal riding, and flirts with her. Strickland "stood it as long as he could. Then he caught hold of the General's bridle, and, in most fluent English, invited him to step off and be flung over the cliff." Miss Youghal explains, and the General begins to laugh. He intercedes on the behalf of the young pair to her parents, and they are married.

Léon Duguit

Léon Duguit (1859–1928) was a leading French scholar of administrative law. After a stint at Caen from 1882 to 1886, he was appointed to a chair of constitutional law at the University of Bordeaux in 1892, where one of his colleagues was Émile Durkheim. 
Duguit's novel objectivist theory of public and constitutional law, developed in amicable rivalry with his colleague Maurice Hauriou of Toulouse, was to have a lasting effect on the development of these areas of law. In Duguit's view, the state was not a mythical Sovereign inherently superior to all its subjects, or even a particularly powerful legal person, but merely a group of people engaged in public service, the activity constituting and legitimising the state. Although critical of notions such as sovereignty, legal personhood and even property to the extent it is not legitimised by a social purpose, he distanced himself from Marxist thought by emphasizing the role of the economy for the development of the state.

Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Russia participated in and hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow after winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with the song "Believe" performed by Dima Bilan. The Russian entry was selected through a national final, organised by the Russian broadcaster Channel One Russia (C1R). Anastasia Prikhodko represented Russia with the song "Mamo", which scored 91 points in the final and finished in 11th place.
National final.
On 10 December 2008, Channel One held a press conference regarding the organisation of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, during which the general director of the channel, Konstantin Ernst, confirmed that the Russian entry for the upcoming contest would be selected through a national final. Initially, the format of the selection consisted of three stages: the first stage would select the song, the second stage would select three potential singers and the third stage would select the best combination of one of the three artists performing the selected song. On 4 February 2009, Channel One amended the format of the selection to a competition where artists would compete with the songs they submitted. Yuriy Aksyuta, music director at Channel One, revealed on 21 February 2009 that over 1000 entries had already been submitted to the competition and that an expert jury would be responsible for selecting 15-20 entries to compete in the national final. On 26 February 2009, Channel One announced the 15 entries that were selected to compete in the competition.
Several of the selected entries were in violation of the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest, in particular, the rule according to which participating songs, in full or in part, should not be publicly performed, released as audio or video, published on the internet or in any other way before 1 October 2008. Venger Collective, Tim Rocks, Polina Griffith and Kvatro all entered songs that were in violation of this rule. Polina Griffith changed her entry from "Love Is Independent" to "Cry For You" and Kvatro changed their entry from "Ya tebya lyublyu" to "Lyubovyu otvechay". The other performers continued in the competition with ineligible songs. 
On 5 March 2009, Channel One added Anastasia Prikhodko and the song "Mamo" as the 16th participant in the national final. The decision to include another entry days before the national final was scheduled to take place was seen as controversial and in violation of the rules that Channel One had outlined for the competition. Prikhodko was previously participating in the 2009 Ukrainian national selection and her early elimination from that contest, due to rule violations, inspired the singer to protest the decisions of the organisers of the Ukrainian pre-selection and launch a campaign to be reinstated with the song "Mamo". Prikhodko discontinued her efforts to participate in Ukraine after her inclusion in the Russian national final.
Final.
The Russian national final was held on 7 March 2009 at the Channel One television studios in Moscow, hosted by Andrey Malakhov and Yana Churikova with Dmitry Shepelev reporting from the green room. In the first round of the competition, a combination of jury (50%) and televoting (50%) selected the top three entries to qualify to a Super Final. In the Super Final, each member of the jury could cast one vote for the song they preferred and the song with the highest number of votes would be the winner. 
Several interval acts were included in the show including former Russian Eurovision entrants Dima Bilan, Alsou and Serebro, and artists from different countries that have already been selected to compete at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009: Jade Ewen for the United Kingdom, Patricia Kaas for France, Sakis Rouvas for Greece and AySel and Arash for Azerbaijan.
Anastasia Prikhodko performing "Mamo", Valeriya performing "Back to Love" and Kvatro performing "Lyubovyu otvechay" qualified to the Super Final. 
Super Final.
An eleven member jury selected the final winner from the three super finalists. The winner, receiving six of the eleven votes, was Anastasia Prikhodko and the song "Mamo".
The jury panel included television and music producers: Yuriy Aksyuta, Kim Breitburg, Alexander Dulov, Igor Krutoy, Alexander Lunyov, Vladimir Matetsky, Ruben Oganesov, Larisa Sinelschikova, Maxim Fadeev, as well as the secretary of organising committee of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in the Government of the Russian Federation, Alexander Barannikov and head of the Humanitarian Cooperation Council of CIS countries, Dzhohan Pollyeva.
Prikhodko's win sparked allegations of vote-rigging. Valeriya's producer Yusif Prigozhin did not agree with the bilingual nature of Prikhodko's song stating: “A song performed in Ukrainian can’t have anything to do with Russia”.
At Eurovision.
As the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 and host of the 2009 Contest, Russia automatically qualified for a place in the final, held on 16 May 2009. In addition to their participation in the final, Russia was assigned to vote in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009.
During the draw for running order on 16 March 2009, Russia was drawn to perform 10th in the final. In the final, Russia performed following Armenia and preceding Azerbaijan. The Russian performance featured Prikhodko in a white dress joined by five backing vocalists dressed in costumes with ethnic elements. The various screens of the stage displayed Prikhodko's face being progressively aged while singing the lyrics of the song. Russia placed 11th in the final, scoring 91 points. On 31 July 2009, the European Broadcasting Union released the split results for the final. The results of the televoting placed Russia in 8th place with 118 points, while the jury vote placed Russia 17th with 67 points.
In Russia, both the semi-finals and the final were broadcast on Channel One Russia, with commentary provided by Yana Churikova for all shows, Aleksey Manuylov for the semi-finals and Philipp Kirkorov for the final. 
For the 2009 Contest, a national jury of five members was assembled by every country in order to provide 50% of the votes in the final of the competition in combination with the results of the televoting. Russia's votes in the second semi-final were determined solely from the result of the public televote. The national jury that provided 50% of the Russian vote in the final consisted of: Igor Matvienko (producer), Youddiph (singer), Tamara Gverdtsiteli (singer), Alexander Lunev (composer) and Elena Kiper (producer). The voting spokesperson for Russia was Ingeborga Dapkūnaitė.

Shopaholic Abroad

Shopaholic Abroad (also known as Shopaholic Takes Manhattan) (2001) is the second in the "Shopaholic" series. It is an adventure novel by Sophie Kinsella, a pseudonym of Madeline Wickham. It follows the story of Becky Bloomwood and her adventures when she's offered the chance to work in New York.
Plot synopsis.
Life looks good for Becky Bloomwood. She has a great relationship with boyfriend Luke as well as a steady job giving financial advice on television. Furthermore, she is on good terms with her bank manager, Derek Smeath. Life becomes problematic for Becky when Mr. Smeath retires from Endwich Bank and Luke announces he wants to make it big in New York, big changes are in store for Becky. She takes to New York like an angel to heaven. Becky has never been happier and the reader is treated to Becky seeing the Guggenheim in a unique way, winning the attention of employees at Barney's and discovering sample sales. Becky spends a substantial amount of money, but is sure she's financially secure, with the job offers on T.V. piling up. She also justifies her expenses by convincing herself that the items are an investment in the future. 
An article in the "Daily World" reveals her high debts, calls her a fraud for telling people how to manage their money when she is herself feckless. This causes a fight between her and Luke, as there are current rumours about that his PR company, Brandon Communications, will lose Bank of London as their client, and her being revealed as in debt (and Luke not even knowing about it) doesn't help situations. More and more opportunities are ruled out, when more and more people read the article. She even loses her current job on Morning Coffee, and is replaced by her former co-worker Clare Edwards, who Becky never liked, being boring and smug. She returns home to her roommate and best friend Suze, while Luke remains in New York, and their relationship comes to an apparent end. 
Becky and Suze go to Becky's new bank manager to ask for a bigger overdraft, but are met with nothing but hostility and disgust. A woman who worked for her former employers Morning Coffee contacts her and asks her to lunch, Becky becomes hopeful, but it turns out she only wants her to come on and be told off by Clare for TV. She becomes depressed and Suze tries to comfort her. On a trip to Luke's office to collect a package for her delivered there, Becky decides that she will see Mel, Luke's secretary, for a bit because she missed her. She collects her package, but also notices how quiet it is with no morale. She hides in Mel's desk just in time so no one catches her in the office. During that time, she overhears Alicia's conversation with her fiancé, Ben Bridges, and another Brandon C. worker, which confuses her. Becky discovers she, along with her colleagues and Bridges, are planning to steal Luke's clients, along with Bank of London, and run the company out of business to embarrass Luke. She waits for them to leave, which they do after a few tense minutes and she safely leaves Brandon C. Becky decides to do a little detective work and find out more about Alicia's plans. She heads down to King Street and ask a tenant about any new businesses coming into the street. He tells Becky the empty 2nd floor of the building he owns, will be the future home of a financial public relations business called "Bridges and Billington" and the Bank of London will be one of their future clients. Furious, Becky immediately contacts Luke's colleague Michael Ellis and tells him the truth about Alicia's plans. He thanks her, but she requests that he does not tell Luke that it was her, fearing that he will think she's gossiping behind his back to prove a point. Michael agrees to cover for Becky by telling him that he found out from an anonymous tip and will look into it.
The next day, Suze suggests for a healing and empowering exercise that Becky throw out all her unnecessary possessions. She was against it at first, but later agrees when she saw how cluttered her room is. While trying to tidy up, she comes up a better idea after watching a commercial on TV: sell her possessions instead. During that time, Becky gets a call from Michael and invites her to lunch at the Savoy Hotel. He congratulates her for helping them out because her information saved Brandon C. from being run out of business by exposing Alicia and her colleagues for trying to ruin the company's reputation with their clients. Michael reveals that Luke has returned to London to try and salvage his company's reputation with his clients while trying to keep interest open in America. Ben, as it turns out, was a key player in Alicia's plans; because of his wealth, he was able to finance the project that they've been working on for some time. They were planning to steal all of Brandon C.'s clients and set up business elsewhere in King Street. As soon as Luke left with Becky for New York, she and her colleagues got to work immediately by telling their co-workers and clients a bunch of rumors that he will close the UK branch. As a result, clients are threatening to sue him and workers were leaving earlier, all the while she was telling him a different story. Once Michael told Luke the truth, he immediately returned to search their desks and found plenty of evidence. Furious, he took Alicia and her colleagues by surprise in the meeting room and he fired them for it. Noticing that Becky has no job and is in debt, Michael offers her a job in Washington DC and can help her with immigration as he's got a good lawyer to convince them. He also offers her good advice in finding work that she's real passionate about and not fall into a job she doesn't like. 
Becky realizes that shopping is a huge investment and holds an auction for her clothes and items. She sells all of it, even her Denny and George scarf, a big symbol for her and Luke's relationship, which makes more than three times her money back to pay off her debts. Becky accepts the slot on Morning Coffee, but shocks them all by telling them she has no more financial problems, has paid of all her debt, and is heading off to New York now to work at Barney's (all of which is now true). Her former co-workers beg her to stay and answer questions from people on the phone wanting to know how she got out of debt. Becky heads to the airport with her travelling luggage ready to head to New York. Though unable to get an upgrade, the clerk was able to get her a window seat near the emergency exit with plenty of leg room.
Luke turns up at the airport, and tells Becky that Michael told him all about what she did for his company, and thanks her although he was angry about it because she should have told him. She defended herself stating she was worried that Luke wouldn't believe her if she came to him about Alicia and thought Michael was a safer bet. While having a drink at the airport bar, he revealed that he confronted the reporter from Daily World that wrote the bad article to reveal her source and was enraged when he found out Alicia was involved. After returning to London, Luke did extensive search in her desk and had found bank statements that belonged to Becky. This revelation made her feel bad for leaving her bank statements behind unaware of the trouble it and the excessive shopping caused her. However, Luke reveals that he was Alicia's real target and she was a mere stepping stone. He admits he realized his mistake in accusing Becky for ruining his deal and apologizes after learning Alicia ruined her T.V. career intentionally so she had an easier shot at embarrassing him by ruining Brandon C's reputation with their clients and running it out of business. She tells Luke that it was also her own fault, because if she had been keeping tabs on her money and not gone shopping excessively in New York, she wouldn't have put herself in the mess she was in. In a lot of ways, Becky was glad she read the article because she realised she had to grow up and start paying back her debts. Luke begs her to stay, to come and work at Brandon C. after revealing how much Alicia decimated his staff. Becky refuses and tells him she doesn't want to settle down at a job she doesn't want, as she's too young for that. Before she leaves, Luke gives her back her Denny and George scarf, revealing that the two bidders pitting against each other were him. Becky leaves for New York to accept a job at Barney's.
Some time later, Becky is working as a personal shopper at Barney's in New York. She has regular TV appearances representing fashion styles, which gains her more than three times her viewers back. Becky is helping out a customer to accessorize an outfit, when Luke shows up as a customer. He apologizes for all that happened. She soon realizes she really missed him, so they make up and get back together.
Characters.
Alicia Billington: Luke's employee at Brandon Communications and is described by Becky as being blonde and long-legs in the first novel. This earns her the nickname Alicia Bitch Long-Legs because she's selfish and uncaring of others. Alicia and Suze have a bitter history with each other when they first worked at Brandon C as PRs. She plays an important role in ruining Becky's TV career by exposing her in an article from Daily World in calling her a fraud for telling others in how to save her money when she can't do it herself and with her bank statements to back it up. With her TV career ruined, Alicia turns her attention in ruining Luke's PR company. With her colleagues and her fiance, Ben, supporting her, she plans to steal all of his clients, including the Bank of London and set up business in King Street. Becky learns about Alicia's plans, tells Michael about it and Luke returns to England to dig up evidence. He finds a lot, and took Alicia, her colleagues and Ben by surprise in the meeting room. She is fired from Brandon C. for her plans to ruin the company's reputation by stealing their most important clients and setting up business elsewhere.
Ben Bridges: Alicia's fiancé and key player in her plans. He was the one who funded the project because of his wealth and it was carefully well thought of. He and Alicia had gotten a new business in King Street which got derailed when Luke found out the truth and returned to England.
Michael Ellis: Luke's colleague in America. He and Becky becomes good friends. It was she who told him about what Alicia had done that lead him to telling Luke the truth, but keeping Becky a secret to himself. Michael offers her a job in Washington D.C. when he learns that she is in debt and has no job. He also encourages her to find work she's passionate about and not fall into anything she's doesn't like.
Christina Rowan: The head of the personal shoppers at Barney's in New York. Becky comes as a customer there, but ends up working for her after losing her job on the Morning Coffee.
Elinor Sherman: Luke's biological mother, whom Becky immediately dislikes as she's cold, disinterested and uncaring of her son's attempt to try and reach out to her. This plays a crucial role in Shopaholic Ties The Knot when she calls out Elinor for being cold and selfish towards her son. In turn, she greatly despises Becky as she's immature and a flake for Luke's taste. She and Elinor would eventually reconcile in Mini Shopaholic, when she accepts responsibility for her actions and helps plan for Luke's surprise birthday party.
John Gavin: The new manager of Endwich Bank which Derek Smeath used to work. After reading the article from the Daily World, he greatly shows hostility towards Becky when she and Suze arrive and ask for a bigger overdraft. He sneeringly tells Becky that she needs to stop living in a fantasy world and grow up.

Cornelius Hazart

Cornelius Hazart (28 October 1617 – 25 October 1690) was a Dutch Jesuit controversialist, orator, and writer of polemical history.
Life.
Hazart was born at Oudenaarde in the County of Flanders. He entered the Society of Jesus on 24 September 1634 and was ordained priest, 6 April 1647, at Leuven, where he had already the reputation of "perfectus orator". He was professed on 1 November 1651; and preached during a period of thirty-six years, for a time at Dunkirk and Brussels, then permanently at Antwerp, where he died.
Hazart's life, apart from the duties of his pastoral office, was almost exclusively taken up with his struggle against the Calvinists of the Low Countries. His "Epistola ad Langravium Hassiæ-Rheinfeldtium" shows him active in Germany. He delivered, at the church of the professed house at Antwerp, a series of sermons on controversial questions. Some of these he preached in the market-place, before Calvinists there for the festivities held in connection with church dedication services.
Works.
Sommervogel enumerates about ninety writings of his, chiefly in Dutch. The "Kerkelijke Historie van de geeheele wereldt" (Universal Church History), 4 vols. (Antwerp, 1667–71) was translated into High German and added to by other Jesuits, under the title "Kirchengeschichte, das ist katholiches Christendum, durch die ganze Welt verbreitet".
All of Hazart's writings are apologetic and polemical in character. They treat of controversial questions: Holy Mass, the Real Presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, the invocation of the saints, the force of good works, auricular confession, extreme unction, purgatory, idolatry, the primacy and infallibility of the pope, the Roman catechism. Hazart relied on Scripture and the early Church Fathers, was quick to refute, but himself was flawed.
In the case of Schuler, he contented himself with a "Vriendelyke t'saemen-spraek tuschen D. Joannes Schulen Predicant tot Breda ende P. C. Hazart" (A friendly colloquy between John Schuler, preacher of Breda, and P. C. Hazart). Many of his writings, such as "Triomph de pausen van Roomen" (Triumph of the Roman Pontiffs), gave rise to a controversial literature.

IVMS

An IVMS "(In Vehicle Monitoring System)" combines the installation of an electronic device in a vehicle, or fleet of vehicles, with purpose-designed computer software at least at one operational base to enable the owner or a third party to track the vehicle's location, collecting data in the process from the field and deliver it to the base of operation. Modern vehicle tracking systems commonly use GPS technology for locating the vehicle, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology can also be used. Vehicle information can be viewed on electronic maps via the Internet or specialized software. 
Urban public transit authorities, Mining companies and Transport/Freight companies are an increasingly common user of vehicle tracking systems.
Several types of vehicle tracking devices exist. Typically they are classified as "passive" and "active". 
"Passive" devices store GPS location, speed, heading and sometimes a trigger event such as key on/off, door open/closed. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point, the device is removed and the data downloaded to a computer for evaluation. Passive systems include auto download type that transfer data via wireless download. 
"Active" devices also collect the same information but usually transmit the data in real-time via cellular or satellite networks to a computer or data center for evaluation. The information is typically analysed and presented using web based technologies. 
Many modern IVMS devices combine both active and passive tracking abilities: when a cellular network is available and a tracking device is connected it transmits data to a server; when a network is not available the device stores data in internal memory and will transmit stored data to the server later when the network becomes available again.
Historically IVMS has been accomplished by installing a box into the vehicle, either self-powered with a battery or wired into the vehicle's power system. For detailed vehicle locating and tracking this is still the predominant method; however, many companies are increasingly interested in the emerging cell phone technologies that provide tracking of multiple entities, such as both a salesperson and their vehicle. These systems also offer tracking of calls, texts, Web use and generally provide a wider safety net for the staff member and the vehicle.

Danielle Licari

Danielle Licari (born 11 November 1943) is a French singer who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. She's now remembered in France as a backing vocalist in chanson.
Career.
In 1964, she dubbed the singing in the movie "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" for the role of Geneviève Emery, played by Catherine Deneuve.
In 1969, she recorded her greatest hit, "Concerto pour une Voix". The album has sold over 15 million copies.
In 1968, she recorded "Treize jours en France" composed by Francis Lai; she also recorded a second version of “Love Story” dedicated to her by the same composer.
In 1972, she submitted her song "Au cœur d'une chanson" to compete in the Eurovision contest representing France. The French committee selected Betty Mars and her song “Come-Comedie” instead.
In 1972, she represented France in the "World Popular Song Festival" held in Tokio, Japan. Her song "Une Vie" was a finalist.
In July 1978, she sang with the Quebec Symphony Orchestra and the choir of St-Dominique Church. The piece chosen was a musical drama called "Concerto pour Helene", in honour of Helene Boule, the wife of the founder of Quebec City, as part of the city's 370th anniversary celebrations. The work was composed by Claude Léveillé.
Wyclef Jean sampled "Concerto Pour Une Voix" in his 1997 song "Apolcalypse."
She has sold over 20 million copies of her albums during her career. Her songs are found in easy listening CD compilations worldwide.
Singing style.
Her characteristic singing style lacked lyrics, communicating emotions through sounds, the way a violin would. This may have fueled her popularity in non-French speaking countries like Germany, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and Korea. She used her voice like a musical instrument giving a soft, unique dream-like tone. She has been called "la voz de la sirena" ("the voice of a mermaid"). Most of her recordings are arrangements of classical themes composed originally for instruments rather than voice, while the arrangements consist generally of large orchestral ensembles mixed with a pop-rock band instrumentation. She incorporated pop-rock elements that made her music appealing. Her singing style influenced Japanese Anime soundtracks of 1980s such as Seiji Yokoyama ("Saint Seiya").
Discography.
Backing vocals.
Danièle Licari also sang for other artists, such as French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré.

2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence

The United Progressive Alliance (UPA), the governing alliance in India elected in 2004, faced its first confidence vote in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) on 22 July 2008 after the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front withdrew support over India approaching the IAEA for the Indo-US nuclear deal. The vote was so crucial that the UPA and the opposition parties summoned MPs from their sick beds and even from prison cells to take part in the vote, which was eventually won by the Government.
Before the vote.
The following list indicates the official position of the political parties before the voting. 
UPA and supporters: 268 MPs for the government 
NDA and others: 263 MPs against the government 
Undecided: 11 MPs 
Non-voting: 1 MP
Voting.
In the 543 member Lok Sabha, the UPA needed 272 votes for the government to enjoy a simple majority. The UPA won the confidence vote with 275 votes to the opposition's 256, (10 members abstained from the vote) to record a 19-vote victory.
Abstensions.
Ten members abstained from the voting despite some of them having received strict contrary instructions from their parties. 
Among the 10, 2 MPs followed their party decision of abstaining so as to not be seen as supporting the UPA or the BJP, Left led opposition. Those two were:
The other 8 members who abstained defied their party stand. These 8 were:

The BJP MP Kulaste, alleged that Amar Singh and Congress leader Ahmed Patel, an aide to Sonia Gandhi tried to offer bribe of to remain absent from the confidence vote. Amar Singh denied the charges. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee asked the police chief of New Delhi to investigate the bribery issue. Indian news channel "CNN IBN" which carried out the sting operation by recording using hidden cameras agreed to share the material with Indian authorities. A joint parliamentary committee formed to investigate the issue submitted its report to the Lok Sabha on 15 December 2008, after finding no evidence for bribery against the MPs Amar Singh and Ahmad Patel, thereby exonerating them.

Oakajee Port

Oakajee Port is a proposed deep water port to be built in the Mid West region of Western Australia, about north of the city of Geraldton to service the region's growing iron ore industry. Approval by the Government of Western Australia for the construction and operation of the port and rail facility was announced on 29 July 2008, with the contract being awarded to Oakajee Port & Rail Pty Ltd, a joint venture between Murchison Metals Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation.
Delays.
Construction was expected to commence in 2011 with completion possible by 2014. As of February 2013 construction had not started. The project, including the associated rail project and rolling stock is expected to cost about A$4 billion. The port will have an initial capacity of 45 million metric tons of iron ore annually.
In 2012, media speculation on the cancellation of the project increased with announcements of delays and cutbacks however the Premier of Western Australia Colin Barnett has publicly stated his desire to facilitate conciliation between the various parties involved 
Location.
The port and facilities will be constructed within approximately of land owned by the State Government. The property is used as farmland but is zoned for heavy industrial and zoned for support industries. It is roughly bordered by the Buller River to the south, Coronation Beach Road to the north and the Moresby Ranges to the east.
History.
Oakagee was a location on the Northampton railway line in the era between 1879 and 1957.
The site was first considered as a port and railway terminus approximately 30 years ago.
Opposition to the project from locals has highlighted environmental concerns including the destruction of the nearby and pristine Coronation Beach.
Lobbying in favour of the project has been from a partnership known as Geraldton Iron Ore Alliance which includes miners Mount Gibson Iron, Midwest Corporation (ASX:MIS), Murchison Metals Ltd (ASX:MMX), Gindalbie Metals (ASX:GBG), Golden West Resources, Royal Resources Ltd, Asia Iron Holdings Ltd and Atlas Iron Ltd.
The alternative project considered by the government was to deepen and enlarge the existing Geraldton Port, however this was considered non-viable due to environmental issues associated with the port being situated relatively close to the city.
Railway.
The new port will be served by a dual gauge railway line providing for both narrow gauge and standard gauge .

Jean Serra

Jean Paul Frédéric Serra (born 1940 in Algeria) is a French mathematician and engineer, and known as one of the co-founders (together with Georges Matheron) of mathematical morphology.
Biography.
Education.
Serra received a scientific baccalauréat in 1957, and an engineering degree from the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy in 1962. He also obtained a Bachelor degree in philosophy/psychology, from the University of Nancy, in 1965. He obtained a PhD in Mathematical Geology from the University of Nancy in 1967, and a "doctorat d'etat" in Mathematics, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, in 1986. He speaks French, Russian, English, and Spanish.
Mathematical morphology.
From 1962 to 1966, while a research engineer at the "Institut de recherche de la sidérurgie", France, Serra was a PhD student under the supervision of Georges Matheron. The subject of his thesis was "stochastic modeling of the iron deposit of Lorraine, at various scales," one of the goals of which was to quantify petrographic characteristics of its iron orebody. During that period, Serra came up with the idea of using structuring elements for transforming images of cross sections of the ore, in order to gain information about it. The result was a device called "Texture Analyser", which was patented in 1965. This work also lead to the concept of hit-or-miss transform, which evolved into the concepts of erosion, dilation, opening and closing due to Matheron. Granulometry and other concepts followed. In the Winter of 1966, in a pub of Nancy, Matheron, Philippe Formery, and Serra decided to give a name to this body of works: "Mathematical morphology". The new theory and method has since evolved to be applied in a variety of image processing problems and tasks, and is researched worldwide ("main article: Mathematical morphology").
In 1968, the Centre of Mathematical Morphology (CMM) of the École des Mines de Paris was created (after 1979, it was called "Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology"). Matheron was named director, and Serra was hired as master of research ("Maître de Recherches") and assistant director. In 1986, upon the split of the "Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology" into two separate centers, Serra became director of research ("Directeur de Recherches") and the director of the new CMM.
Serra has continued to contribute to mathematical morphology over the years; In fact, some of the most important theoretical developments are due to him:

Oak Grove Fork Clackamas River

Oak Grove Fork Clackamas River is a tributary of the Clackamas River in the U.S. state of Oregon. From its headwaters in the Warm Springs Indian Reservation near Abbot Pass in the Cascade Range, the river flows generally west through Mount Hood National Forest in Clackamas County to the unincorporated community of Ripplebrook. Here it enters the main stem of the Clackamas River. Oak Grove Fork feeds Timothy Lake and Lake Harriet, two artificial impoundments built along its course to control water flows to hydroelectric plants.
Course.
The Oak Grove Fork Clackamas River arises at an elevation of above sea level and falls between source and mouth to an elevation of . The main stem begins in the Cascade Range near Abbot Pass, a mountain gap at , on the border between Clackamas County and Wasco County. Originating on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, the river flows generally west about through the Mount Hood National Forest to the unincorporated community of Ripplebrook, where it joins the main stem of the Clackamas River.
From its source, the river flows about through a landform known as Big Meadows before leaving the reservation. Shortly thereafter, it crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, which follows the river from there to Timothy Lake. Oak Grove Fork then flows between the Clackamas Lake Campground and Clackamas Lake, which lies to the left of the river, before entering Timothy Lake about from the mouth. From here to Ripplebrook, Forest Road 57 follows the river. Campgrounds on the lake shore to the left include Oak Fork, Gone Creek, Hood View, and Pine Point. Meditation Point Campground lies on the opposite shore. While flowing through Timothy Lake, the elevation of which is above sea level, Oak Grove Fork receives Crater Creek, Cooper Creek, and Dinger Creek, all from the right. The river exits the lake via a spillway from the mouth.
Just below the spillway, the river passes the USGS gauge station at Timothy Lake, then receives Anvil Creek from the right, Stone Creek from the left, Buck Creek from the right, Peavine Creek from the left, and Shellrock Creek and Cat Creek, both from the right, before reaching the USGS gauge above Lake Harriet. Lake Harriet Campground lies along the shore to the right. Flowing through the lake, the river receives Kelley Creek from the left, then exits the lake and receives Sam Creek from the left about from the mouth. Then the river receives Skunk Creek and Canyon Creek from the right, Butte Creek from the left, and Station Creek and Pint Creek, both from the right, before passing Ripplebrook, Ripplebrook Campground, the Ripplebrook Ranger Station and Heliport, and the southeastern terminus of Oregon Route 224, which all lie to the right. Shortly thereafter, the river flows by Rainbow Campground, which lies to the left, and enters the Clackamas River about above its confluence with the Willamette River at Gladstone.
Discharge.
The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of Oak Grove Fork at two stations, one below Timothy Lake, from the mouth, and the other above a Portland General Electric (PGE) power plant intake, from the mouth. The average flow of the river at the Timothy Lake gauge is . This is from a drainage basin of . The maximum flow recorded there was on December 24, 1964, and the minimum flow was on September 23, 1968. At the power plant gauge, the average flow is from a drainage basin of . The maximum flow recorded there was on January 7, 1923, and the minimum flow was on August 16, 2004.
Fishing.
The Oak Grove Fork has fishing for Brook trout ("Salvenilus fontinalis") close to the Timothy Lake dam, wild coastal cutthroat trout ("Oncorhynchus clarki clarkii"), and Rainbow trout ("Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus") further down, and Brown trout ("Salmo trutta") close to Harriet Lake. All species respond well to flies or artificial baits. Only artificial lures and flies allowed on the Oak Grove Fork, with barbless hooks.
Hydroelectric dams.
As part of its efforts to generate electricity from water power in the Clackamas River basin, PGE built a dam on the Oak Grove Fork in 1923. The company's power plant at Lake Harriet, created by the dam, began making electricity in 1924. To regulate flows on the Oak Grove Fork and on the mainstem Clackamas River, the company built a dam at Timothy Meadows, upstream of Harriet Lake, in 1956. The new dam formed Timothy Lake, a impoundment that doubles as a recreation site.

Arthur O'Leary

Father Arthur O'Leary, O.F.M. (b. at Faniobbus, Iveleary, Co. Cork, Ireland, 1729; d. in London, 8 January 1802) was an Irish Franciscan preacher and polemical writer.
Life.
He was educated with the Franciscans of Saint Malo, where he was ordained and acted as prison chaplain till 1777. He returned to Cork to engage in missionary work. 
He is charged by James Froude with having received secret-service money from the Government, but other historians consider this unproven. In 1786-88 he argued the Catholic case in the so-called "Paper War" between conservative Protestants and moderates that sought further legal reform of the Penal Laws, leading towards Catholic Emancipation. O'Leary's arguments helped Henry Grattan with his proposal in 1788 to remove the tithe paid by Roman Catholics to the Church of Ireland, but this was voted down by the Parliament of Ireland. 
From 1789 till his death he was chaplain to the Spanish embassy in London. He was a wit, and socially acquainted with the circle of Edmund Burke, Richard Sheridan, and Charles James Fox. In the 1790s he built the original St Patrick's Church, Soho Square for the poor London Irish living around St Giles.
Works.
He published tracts characterized by learning, religious feeling, toleration, and allegiance to the Crown. His work for reform of the anti-Catholic penal laws was too heterodox for some Catholics, but not in his own day. Formerly Catholics had been loyal to the Jacobite movement, and some felt that O'Leary was being too friendly to the Hanoverian dynasty. He realised that an engagement with Protestants was necessary to ensure reforms from the British and Irish parliaments, whose members were all Protestant at that time. Reforms had just started with the Papists Act 1778 and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791. 
During the 1790s he was, like many Catholics, horrified at the Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution. 
At the time when the penal laws were slowly being reformed, his aim was for Catholics in Britain and Ireland to achieve legal equality with Anglicans, and he was a precursor of those who finally obtained Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Among his writings are:

Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout.

N.

"N." is a novella written by Stephen King that appears in his collection "Just After Sunset" (2008).
Plot summary.
In the outer circle of a nested narrative, a woman named Sheila writes to her childhood friend Charlie about her brother Johnny, a psychiatrist who recently committed suicide. Sheila suspects it was due to a patient Johnny referred to in his notes only as the eponymous "N."
In the inner circle of the narrative, N. is diagnosed by Dr. John Bonsaint as suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoid delusions related to "keeping balance". N. has become convinced that a circle of stones in a field on the outskirts of a nearby town, Ackerman's Field, contains a potential doorway to another reality, where a terrifying monster, repeatedly said to be a "helmet-headed" being named Cthun, is trying to break through. A warning sign of the monster's imminent penetration (best described as a place where the walls between realities are thin, or perhaps breaking down) is when a person viewing the field sees seven stones, when there are in fact eight. N's belief, shared by those who came before him, is that verifying the presence of eight stones when he is in the field, and his obsession with order when he is absent, somehow strengthens the barrier between our world and the one Cthun dwells in, but that it is a perpetual and exhausting struggle. N.'s obsession eventually leads to his death by suicide, despite Johnny's best efforts.
Following a mysterious compulsion, Johnny goes out to the field to see the stones for himself, he begins to suspect that N. might not have been delusional after all when he suffers from the same symptoms as his patient. Most notable are his obsession with numbers: odd numbers are bad, especially prime ones, even ones are safe, especially if they have a lot of factors, and if the sum of their digits is also even. The effect recedes as winter sets in, since the level of danger seems to be synchronized with the solstices (winter is safest, summer is most dangerous). However, as June approaches, Johnny is driven to madness, and finally kills himself.
A newspaper clipping reveals Sheila's fate: after she read her brother's manuscript, she jumped from a bridge near Ackerman's Field and killed herself, in a manner identical to her brother. A copy of an e-mail indicates that Charlie intends to visit the field in Maine.
Influences.
King in interviews and in the book itself said the story was inspired by Arthur Machen’s The Great God Pan stating: "Not Lovecraft; it’s a riff on Arthur Machen’s 'The Great God Pan,' which is one of the best horror stories ever written. Maybe the best in the English language. Mine isn’t anywhere near that good, but I loved the chance to put neurotic behavior—obsessive/compulsive disorder—together with the idea of a monster-filled macroverse."
Adaptations.
The story, even before its first publication, had been adapted as "Stephen King's N.", a multi-part graphic video series, as part of the marketing campaign for King's upcoming collection. The series consists of 25 one and a half-minute episodes totaling approximately 30 minutes in length. Featuring sophisticated production values, the episodes were drawn by artist Alex Maleev, whose work has appeared on NBC's "Heroes", and colored by comic-book colorist José Villarrubia, best known for his collaborations with Alan Moore, with animation and production by motion graphics studio Motherland, Inc. They were adapted by Marc Guggenheim, co-creator of the ABC TV series "Eli Stone" with creative oversight from Stephen King. The episodes are presented in a cutout animation format, complete with comic book–style graphics, an original score, sound effects, and a full cast of voiceovers that includes actor Ben Shenkman. The series is available on DVD as part of the special collector's edition of "Just After Sunset".
The first episode went online on July 28, 2008 (although viewers who signed up for updates online were given a sneak peek at the first episode the day before). Conceived in a partnership with Scribner, Simon and Schuster Digital, Marvel Entertainment, and CBS Mobile, it is a completely new concept for an online comic series as it is available on mobile phone networks in addition to the iTunes Store and the series official website. According to Simon and Schuster, the series has been viewed over 1 million times via mobile phones and on the Internet.
In March 2010, Marvel published the first issue of a comic book adaptation of "N.", a four-issues limited series.

The Best of Bette (1981 album)

The Best of Bette is a compilation album by American singer Bette Midler, released on the K-tel label in Australia and New Zealand in 1981. The album was the second compilation to use the title "The Best of Bette", the previous version with different cover art and an entirely different track list having been released on the Atlantic Records label in both the UK, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand in 1978.
The K-tel compilation is highly notable in Midler's discography for a number of reasons, the first of them being that it was released by the US based K-tel label instead of Midler's original label Atlantic Records (today a subsidiary of Warner Music Group). K-Tel was a budget-price label specialising in releasing "as-seen-on-TV" compilations including the latest chart hits but at this stage rarely released a whole albums' worth of recordings by the one and same artist. Atlantic Records had exclusive rights to Midler's catalogue worldwide, the sixteen tracks were consequently licensed from Atlantic - but obviously only for release in Australia and New Zealand, not in the US or Europe. The second reason making the album both notable and collectable is the track selection; the album includes songs that by 1981 already had become standards in Midler's repertoire such as her signature tune "Friends", "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy", "Delta Dawn" and "Do You Want To Dance" and combines these with ten tracks taken from her then three most recent albums; a) the disco-flavoured "Thighs and Whispers" (1979) and the two hit singles "Married Men" and "My Knight In Black Leather", b) the soundtrack "The Rose" (1980) and live recordings like "When A Man Loves A Woman", "Midnight In Memphis" and "Love With A Feeling" (the latter two never issued as singles) as well as the studio-recorded title track "The Rose" (the single version with orchestral overdubs, in effect making its debut on this album) and finally c) the soundtrack to the concert documentary "Divine Madness" (1980) and the tracks "My Mother's Eyes" (the only single release from the album) and "Fire Down Below" (also featured in the movie "The Rose", but first released on the "Divine Madness" album). The K-Tel compilation couples these with a few selections from the albums "Broken Blossom" and "Live at Last" such as "Say Goodbye To Hollywood" and "You're Moving Out Today", the latter, a rare single mix with an additional verse making its second appearance on a compilation album. 
The pictures used for the cover of the K-Tel version of "The Best of Bette" show Midler in concert, taken from the movie "The Rose".
The compilation is sometimes listed as having been released in 1980, other times in 1981. Considering the fact that the "Divine Madness" album was released worldwide in November 1980 it was more likely issued in 1981.
The first Bette Midler "greatest hits" compilation to be released worldwide, including the US and Canada, was 1993's "Experience the Divine".

Qiu Shengjiong

Qiu Shengjiong (; born 1 September 1985 in Shanghai) is a Chinese football goalkeeper who currently plays for Shanghai Shenhua in Chinese Super League.
Club career.
Qiu Shengjiong, nicknamed "Big Ox" due to his massive size, would start his career playing for the Shanghai Shenhua youth team where due to his frame and size he was often criticized for being too fat to play football, he would nevertheless play within the 10th National Games of the People's Republic of China for Shanghai where he impressed many by starring within a semi-final penalty shoot out against Hubei and helped guide Shanghai to a runners-up position within the tournament. This would then see Shenhua offer him promotion into the senior team in 2006, however it wasn't until the 2007 Chinese Super League season when Qiu made his league debut on August 12, 2007 against Beijing Guoan F.C. in a 3-2 victory. That performance would then see Qiu rise to prominence within the team and he would replace Wang Dalei as the club's first choice goalkeeper throughout the rest of the season. During the start of the 2008 league season he started several league games before Wang Dalei regained his position as the club's first choice goalkeeper. When Jia Xiuquan became the team's Head coach the goalkeeping position was up for grabs once again and they equally shared the goalkeeping position throughout the 2009 league campaign until the 2010 league campaign saw Miroslav Blažević as the team's Head coach and he placed Qiu Shengjiong as the second choice goalkeeper. In recent seasons, due to Wang Dalei's stable performance and Shanghai Shenhua's usual early elimination from China FA Cup, Qiu's playing time was severely limited.
International career.
Due to his impressive performances at the end of the 2007 season he was called into the Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Men's tournament squad where he was first choice goalkeeper. However due to disappointing results he was replaced by Liu Zhenli in the final group game.

Dale Eldred

Dale Eldred (b. Minneapolis, Minnesota 1933; d. Kansas City, Missouri 1993) was an internationally acclaimed sculptor renowned for large-scale sculptures that emphasized both natural and generated light.
Biography.
The grandson of Finnish immigrant builders, Eldred was raised in Minnesota. Eldred moved to Kansas City in 1959, fresh out of the University of Michigan. Within a year, he was named chairman of the sculpture department of Kansas City Art Institute.

Eldred chaired the sculpture department at KCAI for 33 years, exerting a powerful influence on thousands of students, including: James Clover, Gary Freeman, Shawn Brixey, Ming Fay, Michael Rees, John E. Buck, and the collaborative couple, (the late) Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler who met at KCAI. He also was the artistic director of Biosphere II, and was a fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Advanced Visual Studies.
Dale Eldred was a victim of the "500-year" flood in the summer of 1993, when the Missouri River inundated parts of Kansas City. He was killed in a fall trying to rescue equipment in his West Bottoms-neighborhood studio.
Sculpture.
Eldred's early sculptures were large works in clay. Influenced by the monumental steel sculptures of David Smith and Alexander Calder, he began to work in steel, wood and other materials, creating large sculptures and environments. Examples of these include a sculpture composed of a pair of large cantilevered slabs of wood and steel, placed near the entrance of the Kansas City Art Institute; and a park in northern Kansas City, Missouri housing a large stone and lumber environment. His work of this time was reviewed favorably by critic and artist Donald Judd.
Eldred was commissioned to redesign downtown Kansas City, Kansas. His challenging modernist design included futuristic fountains, irregular streets, and steel curbs. Received poorly, its unpopularity led the city to modify much of his work, but aspects still exist today. 
Eldred expressed his desire to reveal natural phenomena. He created a towering sculpture in a Kansas City park that sprayed water in order to create prismatic light refractions. His emphasis increasingly focused on light; he used mirrors, pure pigments, gas flames, fluorescent paint, refraction tape, glass, neon tubes and other materials to create light effects. "I want the sculptures to remind us all," he said, "that our lives are inextricably linked to light, and that our universe is in constant motion."[http://users.rcn.com/jdeubel/plaza/timelig.html]
In collaboration with choreographer Todd Bolender, he created the set and costumes for "Voyager," a ballet performed by the State Ballet of Missouri. 
He collaborated with other highly regarded artists and musicians, including composer Philip Glass.

William Hedges (Australian politician)

William Noah Hedges (16 July 1856 – 21 November 1935) was an Australian politician. Born in Hertfordshire in England, he received a primary education before his migration to Australia in 1878, where he became a public works contractor. He moved to Western Australia in 1893, where he became a company director. In 1906, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for Fremantle, representing the Western Australian Party as its only representative (John Forrest was nominally the leader but in practice did not involve himself in the party). Hedges sat effectively as an independent until 1909, when he joined the newly formed Commonwealth Liberal Party. He held the seat until his defeat in 1913. In 1929, he was appointed President of the Western Australian Employers Federation; he remained in this position until his death in 1935.

LED display

An LED display is a flat panel display, which uses an array of light-emitting diodes as a video display. An LED panel is a small display, or a component of a larger display. They are typically used outdoors in store signs and billboards, and in recent years have also become commonly used in destination signs on public transport vehicles or even as part of transparent glass area. LED panels are sometimes used as form of lighting, for the purpose of general illumination, task lighting, or even stage lighting rather than display.
Types.
There are two types of LED panels: conventional (using discrete LEDs) and surface-mounted device (SMD) panels. Most outdoor screens and some indoor screens are built around discrete LEDs, also known as individually mounted LEDs. A cluster of red, green, and blue diodes is driven together to form a full-color pixel, usually square in shape. These pixels are spaced evenly apart and are measured from center to center for absolute pixel resolution. The largest LED display in the world is over 500 meters long and is located in Suzhou, China, covering the Yuanrong Times Square. The largest LED television in the world is the Center Hung Video Display at Cowboys Stadium, which is , .
Most indoor screens on the market are built using SMD technology — a trend that is now extending to the outdoor market. An SMD pixel consists of red, green, and blue diodes mounted in a single package, which is then mounted on the driver PC board. The individual diodes are smaller than a pinhead and are set very close together. The difference is that the maximum viewing distance is reduced by 25% from the discrete diode screen with the same resolution.
Indoor use generally requires a screen that is based on SMD technology and has a minimum brightness of 600 candelas per square meter (cd/m², sometimes informally called "nits"). This will usually be more than sufficient for corporate and retail applications, but under high ambient-brightness conditions, higher brightness may be required for visibility. Fashion and auto shows are two examples of high-brightness stage lighting that may require higher LED brightness. Conversely, when a screen may appear in a shot on a television studio set, the requirement will often be for lower brightness levels with lower color temperatures; common displays have a white point of 6500–9000 K, which is much bluer than the common lighting on a television production set.
For outdoor use, at least 2,000 cd/m² is required for most situations, whereas higher-brightness types of up to 5,000 cd/m² cope even better with direct sunlight on the screen. (The brightness of LED panels can be reduced from the designed maximum, if required.)
Suitable locations for large display panels are identified by factors such as line of sight, local authority planning requirements (if the installation is to become semi-permanent), vehicular access (trucks carrying the screen, truck-mounted screens, or cranes), cable runs for power and video (accounting for both distance and health and safety requirements), power, suitability of the ground for the location of the screen (if there are no pipes, shallow drains, caves, or tunnels that may not be able to support heavy loads), and overhead obstructions.
Flat panel LED television display.
The first true all-LED flat panel television screen was possibly developed, demonstrated and documented by James P. Mitchell in 1977. The modular, scalable display was initially designed with hundreds of MV50 LEDs and a newly available transistor-transistor logic memory addressing circuit from Texas Instruments. The ¼-inch thin flat panel prototype and the scientific paper were displayed at the 29th ISEF expo in Washington D.C. in May 1978. It received awards by NASA and General Motors Corporation. A liquid crystal display (LCD) matrix design was also cited in the LED paper as an alternative x-y scan technology and as a future alternate television display method. Additional recognition was provided by Westinghouse Educational Foundation "Honors Group" and the concept prototype was also a selected scientific paper at the Iowa Academy of Science of the University of Northern Iowa. The replacement of the 70 year+ high-voltage analog system (cathode-ray tube technology) with a digital x-y scan system has been a significant achievement. Displacement of the electromagnetic scan systems included the removal of inductive deflection, electron beam and color convergence circuits. The digital x-y scan system has helped the modern television to “collapse” into its current thin form factor.
The 1977 model was monochromatic by design. Efficient blue LEDs did not arrive for another decade. Large displays now use high-brightness diodes to generate a wide spectrum of colors. It took three decades and organic light-emitting diodes for Sony to introduce an LED TV: the Sony XEL-1 OLED screen which was marketed in 2009.
The largest 3D LED television display.
The 2011 UEFA Champions League Final match between Manchester United and Barcelona was broadcast live in 3D format in Gothenburg (Sweden), on an EKTA screen. It had a refresh rate of 100 Hz, a diagonal of 7.11 m (23 ft 3.92 in) and a display area of 6.192×3.483 m, and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest LED 3D TV.
LED text displays.
LED text displays refer to types that are specialized and limited to display of alpha-numeric characters. Most types display either one character or a group of characters. One character is generally displayed by a matrix of LEDs, or by a matrix of segments.

Zizina labradus

Zizina labradus, commonly known as the Common Grass Blue, Grass Blue, or Clover Blue, is a small Australian butterfly of the Lycaenidae family. 
Description.
Adults are purplish blue on the upper wing surface with a black body and black or brown wing margins. These margins are larger on the female than the male. The lower wing surface is brown to pale brownish-grey with a pattern of fawn bands and spots, with the body covered in white or grey hairs. The wingspans of females are slightly larger than males, females having a wingspan of 23mm and males 20mm. Common Grass Blues have a weak, fluttering flight and so usually fly close to ground level close to a food source.
Eggs are white or pale blue and have a mandarin shape with a pitted surface. Caterpillars reach about 7mm in length, and their appearance is primarily green with a yellow stripe at the sides and a darker green stripe on the back, and brown or black head usually obscured under the thorax. In captivity, fed on an artificial diet, larvae come in highly variable colours, ranging from white through red to dark purple. Pupa are 10mm long with erect hairs. Colouration varies, ranging from pink, greyish or greenish cream and contains mottled dark spots.
Distribution.
The subspecies "Zizina labradus labradus" is found over most of continental Australia, as well as on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and Christmas Island, while the subspecies "Zizina labradus labdalon " is restricted mainly to Cape York Peninsula. The Common Grass Blue is often misidentified as the Lesser Grass Blue, "Zizina otis". 
"Zizina labradus labradus", as its name suggests, is very common and can be found in suburban gardens, particularly perching in grass; lawns and fields. 
Growth.
Single eggs are laid which can hatch in a matter of days. The eggs are laid on leaves, stems, flower buds and young pods of food plants, chiefly legumes of the Fabaceae family such as beans, clover and various native species. Newly hatched larvae eat small holes from young leaves or flower buds, and later feed mainly inside flowers. The larvae are considered a minor pest and will feed on leguminous plants such as garden beans by eating a small hole into the pods and then devouring the soft seeds within. In captivity when food is scarce the larger larvae will cannibalize smaller ones. 
The larvae are typically attended by ants of the genera "Paratrechina", "Rhytidoponera" and "Tapinoma". 
The pupa attaches to the lower leaf surface of the food plants with anal hooks and a central girdle.

István Salloi (born 26 September 1966 in Oroszlány) is a former Hungarian football player who came from a real football family. His grand father played lower divisions and became a referee later. His father played in the Hungarian first league at Tatabanya FC.
Playing career.
Started his career at Videoton FC young team (1981) and became professional player 1986.
Played for ETO FC GYOR (1988–1989) as loan player meanwhile he served his army duty at Gyor.
Returned to Videoton and became the captain and the leader in his home team. His best year was 1992-93 when he was invited to the national team and voted as the Player of the Year and finished 2nd best scorer.
He signed for Honved with the aim to be champion and get an offer from abroad. End of the year of 1994 he accepted the offer from Beitar Jerusalem.
At Beitar Jerusalem F.C. he was known as "Stefan" as the people there had a lot of difficulty in pronouncing the name "István". Played five beautiful years for Beitar and became one of the most favorite foreign player ever played for them. Although he played behind the striker role, he became the best scorer in Beitar in those years and still he is the best Israeli scorer in European competitions with 12 goals. Finished his career at Herzelya in 2000, playing for them 18 month.
Coaching career.
After his football career, he worked as the technical director of the National Team for Hungarian Football Federation. He left the federation and became the club manager (CEO) of SIÓFOK FC 2002-2004 . They promoted to first league in the first year and finished 5th position in top league next season. Although the successful seasons, the club got into financial crisis when the owner couldn't finances the club anymore. Salloi made a new business plan, releasing the expensive players and build a young team with a young coach, Aurel Csertoi. They finished the first part of the league in first place causing big surprise for everyone. Seeing his success with small club, Újpest FC, one of the biggest and most popular team in Hungary, offered him the CEO position in winter break and he took the job. Újpest FC started the second part of the league in 8th position without head coach who resigned in winter break. Salloi again, give the job to a young coach, Geza Meszoly who made excellent job with his team, winning the second part of the league and finished the 2nd place in the table at the end of the season. In 2005, when new owner arrived to the club, Salloi resigned. He moved to Diósgyőr FC to a very popular team which was year by year in financial crisis. For that time Salloi was called in Hungary 'man who can manage the financial crisis'. He did the job again, stabilized the club and madeDiósgyőr FC a stable mid table team. End of 2007, the new owner of Ujpest FC called him back to Újpest FC as a sport director. His task was to build a team who can win the league. Újpest FC finished in 2nd place after a year and made over 1 million euros profit on transfer fees.

Commelina cyanea

Commelina cyanea, commonly known as scurvy weed, is a perennial prostrate herb of the family Commelinaceae native to moist forests and woodlands of eastern Australia, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. The blue flowers appear over the warmer months and are pollinated by bees and flies.
Taxonomy.
"Commelina cyanea" was one of the many species initially described by the botanist Robert Brown in his 1810 work "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen" and still bears its original name. The genus name "Commelina" was chosen based on the Asiatic dayflower. Linnaeus picked the name in honour of the Dutch botanists Jan and Caspar Commelijn, using the two large showy petals of "Commelina communis" to symbolise them. The specific name is the Latin adjective "cyaneus", meaning "blue". As well as scurvy weed, alternative common names include (native) wandering Jew, forget-me-not, and creeping Christian.
Description.
"Commelina cyanea" is a trailing herbaceous perennial plant, whose stems grow along the ground. It readily roots at the nodes when they come into contact with the soil. They die off in winter. The leaves are ovate to narrow-ovate, and measure 2–7 cm (0.8-2.8 in) long by 0.5-1.5 cm (0.2-0.6 in) wide. The flowers can occur at any time from spring to autumn. They are deep blue and about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in diameter, followed by a capsule bearing 2-5 2-3 mm long seeds.
Distribution and habitat.
The range across eastern New South Wales, from Narooma northwards, up into Queensland. It also occurs on Lord Howe Island, and Norfolk Island. It grows in wetter shaded areas in forest habitats.
Ecology.
"Commelina cyanea" is pollinated by a variety of native bees such as "Nomia aurantifer", "Amegilla pulchra", halictid and colletid bees, and syrphid flies (genus "Syritta"). Wallabies and rabbits eat the vegetation. Vegetation is also possibly dispersed by water.
Uses.
The leaves are used as an edible vegetable. The leaves were used by early non-indigenous colonists to alleviate scurvy, and hence its common name. 
Attractive in flower, "Commelina cyanea" adapts readily to cultivation and can be grown as a groundcover or in hanging baskets. It is easily propagated from cuttings. It does resemble the introduced weed wandering Jew ("Tradescantia fluminensis"), but the latter has white flowers and a segmented stem, a weak root system. It also lacks the hairy leaf sheathes of "C. cyanea". However, "C. cyanea" can itself be weedy in gardens at times.

Cagayan Special Economic Zone

The Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport, also known as Cagayan Freeport, is a special economic zone in Cagayan, northern Luzon, the Philippines. It was established by virtue of Republic Act No. 7922, otherwise known as the Cagayan Economic Zone Act of 1995. It is being supervised and managed by the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) into a self-sustaining industrial, commercial, financial, and recreational center, with a suitable residential area, in order to create employment opportunities around the Cagayan Freeport, and to effectively encourage and attract legitimate and productive local and foreign investments. 
The freeport is actually located in Port Irene, Barangay Casambalangan, Santa Ana, Cagayan. It is approximately a 45-minute plane ride from Kaoshiung, Taiwan's largest industrial and shipping center. By virtue of RA 7922, it can be expanded to Fuga Island in the north.
The freeport is at the forefront of the development of the gaming infrastructure. Gaming operators and entities operating in the freeport enjoy numerous benefits and incentives inherent including the potential of positioning themselves as lead players in the freeport, ensuing global connectivity. It includes the development and operation of a casino resort, an 18-hole golf course, a theme park, and other recreational and tourism amenities. 
The design of the area's master plan was awarded to a consortium composed of several local and foreign specialists including Landseaire Resources and Management Corporation, The Lead Corporation, The Services Group, Hok International, Ltd., Woodward Clyde, Filipinas Dravo, and Pacific Asia Capital Corporation. The plan, which is the first phase of an overall development master plan, includes the development of a port, upgrading the region's agricultural production, rehabilitation of the airstrip, resort development, and creation of an industrial zone while sustaining environmental protection for the entire area.
The freeport also was given autonomy to operate as a separate customs territory similar to Hong Kong, Singapore, Labuan in Malaysia and Hamburg in Germany. It made the location an ideal site for an international transshipment hub. 
Cagayan Economic Zone Act of 1995 was authored by Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a native of Gonzaga town in Cagayan. Cagayan Economic Zone Authority is administered by Jose Mari B. Ponce.
History.
The Philippine Senate passed Republic Act No. 7922, also known as Cagayan Special Economic Zone Act of 1995, creating a special economic zone in Sta. Ana, Cagayan, and some neighboring islands in Aparri, Cagayan.
Cagayan International Airport.
The Northern Cagayan International Airport is an airport under construction in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, to support the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport. It is projected to cost some Php1.67 billion. The international airport will be one of the two international airports being proposed in the Pacific seaboard of Luzon island. Luzon island has only one domestic airport operating on Pacific side - Legazpi Airport.

She came from a family of cyclists, sister of Bella Hage, Heleen Hage and Ciska Hage, and aunt to Jan van Velzen. She was the national pursuit champion 12 times consecutively and won the national road championship nine times, eight times consecutively.
On 16 September 1978, Hage set a world hour record at Munich with 43.082 km. She improved the world 5 km, 10 km and 20 km records in the same ride. She was Dutch sportswoman of the year in 1976 and 1978 and the trophy awarded each year to Holland's best woman cyclist is now named after her. Her record compares poorly to later riders because there were few international stage races for women in her period and no women's cycling in the Olympic Games.
She retired, she said, because:
The Dutch cycling federation, the KNWU, gave her a job working with women coming up in her place. She became what the federation called its coordinator from 1985.
She considered becoming the coach or taking some other defined job within cycling. But that would have involved taking a course and passing examinations, which did not appeal, and there were reports that the KNWU did not encourage her to do so.
She taught handicrafts part-time at a college near her home in Kloetinge outside Goes, in Zeeland, and rode a bike a lot less, saying in 1990 that she missed that but not racing. She gave away all the rainbow champions she won as world champion.

Qalawun complex

The Qalawun complex () is a massive complex in Cairo, Egypt that includes a madrasa, a hospital and a mausoleum. It was built by the Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad Ibn Qalawun in the 1280s; some thirty surviving mosques were built during his time.
History.
The Qalawun Complex was built over the ruins of the Fatimid Palace of Cairo, with several halls in the Palace. It was sold to several people until it was finally bought by the Sultan Qalawun in 1283 AD. The structure resides in the heart of Cairo, in the Bayn al-Qasrayn, and has been a center for important religious ceremonies and rituals of the Islamic faith for years, stretching from the Mamluk dynasty through the Ottoman Empire.
Construction.
The funerary complex of Sultan al-Mansur Sayf al-Din Qalawun, including both madrasa and mausoleum reportedly took 13 months to build, from 1284-1285. This fact is remarkable considering the sheer size and scope of the total complex. The relatively short amount of time it took to construct the complex is in large part due to the slave like labor the Sultan commanded. The hospital took less than six months to complete, the mausoleum and madrasa each taking about four months. The building project was supervised by emir ‘Alam al-Din Sinjar al-Shaja‘i, who forcefully employed hundreds of Mongol prisoners of war, calling upon workers throughout Fustat and Cairo to aid in the project. Al-Shaja’i used whatever means necessary to procure the large labor force needed to complete the project, even calling on people walking through the streets. The Complex was considered one of the most beautiful buildings at that time, where it included a school (Madrasah), a hospital (Bimaristan) and a mausoleum, with a Beautiful Dome. Historians claim that the columns holding the mausoleum structure were made of granite, marble, and other materials that were taken from another palace in Rhoda island.
The complex was built in three stages, where the Hospital was finished first, the Mausoleum and then finally the school.
The structure was restored several times in the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, the son and successor of Sultan Qalawun. He restored the minarets after a strong earthquake occurred in 1327 AD; he recorded the date of restoration on it.
Another restoration came when Abdul-Rahman Katkhuda, created a beautifully built Ottoman Sabil on the other side of the street in 1776.
Mausoleum.
The Mausoleum of Sultan Qalawun in Cairo is considered by many to be the second most beautiful mausoleum, succeeded only by the Taj Mahal in India.
Al-Nuwayri (an Arab Historian), has said in his book Nihayet al Irab (The Utmost Desire), that the Mausoleum was not intended to become a buriel site, but a Mosque and a school, and that it was first used as a tomb when he died, and hosted his body. His body was kept in the Cairo Citadel for two months until the tomb was ready to replace the Citadel's Burial location, later when Qalawun's son died, he too was buried in the Mausoleum. The mihrab of the mausoleum is often considered as the most lavish of its kind. This is in contrast to the mihrab of the madrasa, which is less grand in size and general esthetics. With a horse-shoe profile the mihrab is flanked by three columns made of marble. 
The Mausoleum later on, and under the mamluks included a Museum for Royal Cloths of those buried in it.
The Mausoleum of Qalawun is significant in that it’s dome served as a ceremonial center for the investing of new emirs. Indeed the dome was a symbol of new power, a changing of the guard, signifying a new center of Mamluk power, which enjoyed great prosperity at the time. The Mausoleum's Dome was demolished by the Ottoman Governor over Egypt Abdul-Rahman Katkhuda and was then rebuilt in Ottoman architecture, However the Comite for reservation of Arab monuments built another dome to replace that in 1908.
Madrasa.
Within the madrasa the four legal schools, or the four madhhabs of Islamic law were regularly taught. Other teachings housed in the madrasa included the Hadith and the teaching of medicine. The madrasa had two iwans and two recesses as evidenced by the accompanying waqf document. The large courtyard of the madrasa was paved with polychrome marble.
The sanctuary of the madrasa "faces the courtyard with a tripartite two-storeyed façade consisting of a central arch flanked by two smaller ones, and surmounted by similar arched openings. These were originally surmounted by three oculi, one above two, and not only one, as is the case today." 
The mihrab of the madrasa has a horse-shoe arch similar to the mausoleum but is smaller and less elaborate than that of the mausoleum and its conch is marked with glass mosaics and mother-of-pearl, rather than marble mosaics. The deep red color used in the mosaics stands out.
Hospital.
Though not visible from the street the hospital once stood as the most lavish and impressive hospital of its time. The hospital functioned through the late Ottoman period before being demolished in 1910. The hospital offered many amenities to the sick and poor in addition to medical treatment, including drugs, shelter, food, and clothing. Production of drugs for medical treatment, as well as research and teaching occurred within the hospital. Most of this information has been gleaned from a waqf document from the time. The Medieval Islamic historian al-Maqrizi has his own observations regarding the history of the hospital. According to Maqrizi, the hospital was built from the Fatimid palace of Sayyidat al-Mulk, and could be reached from a corridor leading from the madrasa and mausoleum. Large fountains residing within its walls marked the beauty of the interior of the hospital. Within the hospital also stood a large central courtyard measuring 21x33m.
Architecture.
A slightly horseshoe arched portal leads into a passage separating the Mausoleum from the Madrasah. The tomb is on the right, and the Madrasah, on a cruciform plan, is to the left of the entrance. Inside the four Iwans once contained the four different law schools, on the east side is a fine stucco Mihrab. The interior was in a poor condition until 2000, when a massive Historic Cairo Rehabilitation Project (HCRP) plan was made for the entire Muizz Street, planned to be completed by October 2008. The Mausoleum contains the bodies of al-Nasir' mother, and his son. while the sultan is buried in the adjoining Mausoleum built by his father, Sultan Qalawun
Exterior.
The exterior structure of the Qalawun complex has many unique firsts in Mamluk architecture. The whole complex is said to be the earliest example of an “Urban aesthetic” in Mamluk architecture. This urban aesthetic starts with the layout of the madrasa and mausoleum in relation to each other. The minaret is not attached to the madrasa but to the mausoleum. Also, the minaret does not reside near the entrance of the building, as was a customary practice of the time. The overall effect is the first real juxtaposition of the minaret with the dome. Thankfully the funerary complex is still well preserved today, with certain renovations throughout the years helping to maintain its grandeur. One visits the city of Cairo today it is the Mamluk Cairo they largely see as the various Mamluk buildings dominate the scene.
Interior.
Worth noting about the interior of the various buildings of the total complex is the evidence that it’s architecture was influenced by Norman Sicilian qualities. One such instance of this influence is in the triple windows, which are "composed of two arched openings surmounted by an oculus", which reside in the upper level of the mausoleum façade. The same triple window placement can be seen on the madrasa’s façade, corresponding to the mihrab. "The entire façade design with its double-framed and pointed recess arches recalls the façade of the Palermo Cathedral as it was before restoration". The marble mosaics seen throughout the complex and the large canopy dome are stylistic tendencies also seen in Norman Sicilian architecture, though numerous differences still exist.

Nicolas Deschamps (writer)

Nicolas Deschamps (born at Villefranche, Rhône, France, 1797; died at Aix-en-Provence, 1872) was a French Jesuit controversial writer.
Life.
He entered the Society of Jesus in 1826; taught literature and rhetoric in several colleges and wrote extensively.
Works.
Apart from a few didactic and devotional books, like "Cours élémentaire de littérature" (Avignon, 1860) and "Les fleurs de Marie" (Paris, 1863), his works are largely polemical. They and bear on burning questions of politics and religion in the France of his day: the educational monopoly of the University of France; the state faculties of theology; the Organic Articles; liberty of association; Communism; the issue of paganism in classical education. 
Best known is "Les Sociétés secrètes" published after the author's death (Avignon, 1874–1876), re-edited and brought up to date by Claudio Janet (Paris, 1880 and 1881). Deschamps saw in European Freemasonry, whose origins he traced back to Manichæism, a baneful force. It worked, he claimed, under the cover of philanthropy, but against religion, the social order, patriotism, and even morality.

John Harfield Tredgold

John Harfield Tredgold (1798 – 22 May 1842) was an English chemist in the Cape Colony in Africa. He held a number of voluntary roles including Secretary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. The suburb of Cape Town called Harfield drew its name from Tredgold's middle name.
Biography.
Tredgold was baptised in 1798 by his parents Thomas and Elizabeth Tredgold. His middle name was his mother's surname before she married 10 April 1795.
He arrived in the Cape in 1818 (possibly 24 June 1818) and was licensed on 3 July 1818 as a chemist and druggist in the colony. He became a partner in the pharmacy "Thredgold and Pocock".
Tredgold married Elizabeth Merrington in Cape Town on New Year's Day 1825 in St Georges Cathedral before it was rebuilt. Elizabeth was born in London in December 1806.
Tredgold was a member of the Cape of Good Hope Philanthropic Society and worked with those in poverty. He was one of the founders of the Commercial Exchange and helped to manage the Cape of Good Hope Savings Bank. He was a member of the influential Congregational Union Chapel in Cape Town who laboured for the emancipation of the slaves at the Cape.
He is thought to have employed John Pocock, whose diaries give an insight into the Tredgolds' family life. Of particular note is a reference to an evening party in 1836 when letters were read from Richard Miles, "a Bechuana boy formerly in the employ of Mr T. but now an itinerant preacher to the native tribes beyond the border". Richard Miles was to go on to have an interesting career as a preacher and interpreter long after Tredgold had left the country. In 1850, Richard Miles was appointed "Kaptyn of Bethanie", by the British Resident, Major Warden, in the name of His Excellency the Governor of the Cape.
Tredgold and his family left the Cape on 19 February 1837 due to illness in the family (including his own). This may have been unplanned, as in the same year he was appointed to be a member of a committee authorised by the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, Lt-General Sir Benjamin d'Urban. Those worthies chosen were to be members of the "Children's Friend Society" who were to liase with an organisation of the same name in London to safeguard "poor and destitute" children who were moved so that they might learn a trade.
Tredgold and his wife Elizabeth attended the World's Anti-Slavery Convention on 12 June 1840. The picture above shows them in a painting made to commemorate the event, which attracted delegates from America, France, Haiti, Australia, Ireland, Jamaica and Barbados. Tredgold is shown at the centre of the painting in his role as secretary whilst Thomas Clarkson speaks. His wife is shown with most of the women to the right of the painting. It had been a matter of much debate as to where the female delegates would sit. Eventually the organisers had insisted that they sit with all the other women and male observers. A few women were included in the painting of the convention with Elizabeth Tredgold; these were Elizabeth Pease, Amelia Opie, Baroness Byron, Mary Anne Rawson, Mrs John Beaumont, Thomas Clarkson's daughter Mary and right at the back Lucretia Mott.
After 1842 Elizabeth Tredgold returned to South Africa with five of her children. Two of her boys had died, aged thirteen and eleven, whilst they were in England. Mrs Tredgold died on 16 March 1892 at her daughter Elizabeth McIntyre's house in Ceres, Western Cape.

Polish reggae

Reggae is one of the most popular music genres in Poland. The rastafari philosophy is considered to constitute the main influence on Polish reggae. The majority of songs are sung in Polish, yet a Silesian group R.A.P. provides an important exception to both of the above, since its members clearly stated to have nothing to do with the rasta movement and sung almost exclusively in English. <br>
Some of the popular bands include: Izrael, R.A.P. (Reggae Against Politics), Daab, Habakuk, Pajujo, Love Sen-C Music, Indios Bravos, Natural Dread Killaz, and Vavamuffin. <br>
The reggae group Izrael (1983-1995), from Warsaw, which released at least three albums on Tess Records, has been cited as an example of reggae's popularity in Poland. <br>
The reggae group R.A.P. (Reggae Against Politics) (1985-1987), from Gliwice, did not manage to release any albums during their short existence but their music was not forgotten and in the late 1990s four bootleg albums were legally released by labels Zima Records and Kaya Production. In 2011 Zima Records released R.A.P.'s first official studio album, originally recorded in 1986.
The Warsaw Village Band has been noted to take traditional Polish folk songs and add a reggae touch.
History.
Bob Marley's music is credited as introducing reggae to Poland, and beginning a vibrant reggae movement there. According to reggae studies professor Carolyn Cooper, Marley's lyrics of "resistance against the system" have been a basis of inspiration for some human rights demonstrations in Poland. Another influence was British Rastafarian band Misty In Roots, who played live in the country in 1983 and 1986. In the 1980s Polish rastafarians appeared. The first Polish reggae song was performed by the band Budka Suflera in 1974 - "Sen o dolinie", music by Bill Withers - Ain't No Sunshine, Polish lyrics by Krzysztof Cugowski. The first homegrown Polish reggae groups started in the 1980s, and some even took on the reggae look, complete with dreadlocks. Some Polish reggae groups were included on the compilation album "MUP: Reggae from Around the World", on RAS Records. In 1999, reggae music was a prominent part of Woodstock Junction, an annual music festival in Żary, Poland. Polish-language reggae has retained its popularity over the years, and an all-Polish-language radio station in New York state is more likely to play reggae music than polka music (which might not come as a surprise, since polka music does not originate from Poland).

Andrew Cane

Andrew Cane (fl. 1602 – 1650) — also Kayne, Kene, Keine, and other variants — was a comic actor in late Jacobean and Caroline era London. In his own generation he was a leading comedian and dancer, and one of the famous and popular performers of his time.
Beginnings.
A child with the surname "Keane" (no Christian name recorded) was baptized on 2 March 1589; this might have been the actor/goldsmith. In 1602, Cane began a ten-year apprenticeship to his older brother Richard, who had finished his own apprenticeship and established himself as a goldsmith in 1600. The younger Cane won his "freedom" in the goldsmiths' guild in 1611. Cane married and began a family in 1612.
Jigging clown.
Cane's stage career had begun by 1622, when he was with Prince Charles's Men. By 1634 he was the "chiefe" member of the troupe, and received their payments for their performances at Court.
One of his jobs was dancing the jig that concluded each performance, a traditional task that clowns from Richard Tarlton to John Shank had fulfilled. Like other clowns in this function, Cane used the opportunity of a solo turn on the stage to develop a satiric rapport with his audience. He excelled at the task, and was said to possess "the tongue of Mercury." By the late 1630s, his political satire had grown so sharp that the Privy Council took notice; in 1639 the Council ordered the Attorney General to address the matter of Cane satirizing politicians from the stage of the Red Bull Theatre (though the surviving records do not specify the outcome of the matter).
Cane's stage career was not limited by the official scrutiny. His fame led to non-theatrical expressions: in 1641 a pamphlet titled "The Stage Players Complaint" was printed, which portrays Cane and another famous clown, Timothy Read, exchanging witticisms on the issues of the day, and talking up the worth and value of playacting.
Goldsmith.
A number of figures in English Renaissance drama maintained formal membership in the guilds of London; this allowed them to bind apprentices to contracts, something that actors, as retainers in noble households, could not legally do under the system of the time. Most of these men kept only a formal guild membership: John Heminges maintained his membership in the grocers' guild, but didn't peddle groceries; Ben Jonson kept his membership in the bricklayers' guild, but didn't lay bricks. Andrew Cane, however, was one of a number of actors who pursued a career beyond the stage; he was a member of the goldsmiths' guild and an active goldsmith. He crossed his two careers without hesitation, turning his goldsmithing apprentices into boy actors. The 14-year-old Arthur Savill was apprenticed to Cane the goldsmith on 5 August 1631 — and before the end of the year he was playing Quartilla, one of the female roles in Shackerley Marmion's "Holland's Leaguer." The same production featured, in the role of Millicent, the 17-year-old John Wright, who'd become a Cane apprentice in 1629.
The records of the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate (which was near the Fortune Playhouse and the home of many theatre people) state that a foundling child called Hester, "her parents unknown," was christened on 18 April 1628; she is noted as having been "taken up" at Andrew Cane's "stall," his place of business.
Aftermath.
After the theatres were closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Cane was an active supporter of the Royalist cause. By 1644, goldsmith Cane was coining the Royalists' debased coinage; he may have had to spend time in prison as a result. Cane did not abandon acting permanently, however. On 22 January 1650, he was one of eight performers arrested at the Red Bull Theatre, for play-acting against the regulations of the Commonwealth regime.
In 1654 Cane became involved in a lawsuit with actor William Wintershall and his wife, over a thirty-year-old debt of £40. The debt stemmed from a 1624 agreement between theater manager Richard Gunnell and a group of actors, one of whom was Cane. Wintershall had married Gunnell's daughter Magraret in the early 1640s, and so was drawn into the matter. The outcome of the suit in not known.
The date of Cane's death is also unknown. His son Edward and grandson Andrew continued Cane's trade — not as actors, but goldsmiths.

Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamhung

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamhung is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in North Korea. 
Originally erected as the Apostolic Vicariate of Wonsan in 1920, the name has been changed twice, once to Kankoensis o Hameungensis in 1940, and finally, as the Apostolic Vicariate of Hamhung in 1950. Like the Diocese of Pyongyang, the Vicariate was elevated to a full diocese in 1962. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Seoul.
Persecutions.
In 1949, 166 priests and religious were martyred in the Communist revolution of Kim Il-sung. This left the diocese bereft of priests. Father Josef Bonifatius Sauer, the abbot of Tokwon abbey, had died in 1950, and no bishop had been re-appointed to the diocese. Finally, in 1962, Timotheus (Franz Xaver) Bitterli, was appointed in absentia as the bishop of the diocese, and was the apostolic administrator for 20 years until his resignation in 1981. Since then, the diocese has remained vacant, and it will likely remain so as long as the persecution of Christians in North Korea continues.

Tarot contribution.
Jean-Claude Flornoy has reproduced a number of early decks in the historical Tarot of Marseille and other early French pattern. He brought back to life the Historic decks, mainly conserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. Contributing to save a part of the occidental patrimony.
Biography.
Jean-Claude Flornoy (Paris, 1950–2011) was a 'Cartier-enlumineur' living and working in Sainte-Suzanne,France. Following studies centered around philosophy and psychology, he worked for 15 years as potter-ceramist.
He has devoted 20 years to the study of the Tarots of the French (Marseille) Tradition. In 1996 he undertook an oversized restoration of the tarot of Nicolas Conver (Marseille, 1760). His aim was to faithfully bring this traditional imagery back to life in all its original freshness. He then revived large-sized versions of other historic tarots from originals preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris: Jean Noblet (Paris, c. 1650), Jean Dodal (Lyon, 1701) and a number of trumps from Jacques Viéville (Paris, c. 1650). It was in painting each arcane on giant canvases (220 cm by 110 cm) that he was able to come to 'understand' the way the images are operative in themselves. He regularly transports them for exhibitions, and proposes conference-workshops in a variety of tarot-related contexts.

Rupert Pennefather

Rupert Pennefather is a principal dancer in the Royal Ballet Company. He was promoted to principal status alongside his pas-de-deux partner Lauren Cuthbertson in June 2008, following well-received performances in Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Opera House.
Rupert has gained acclaim despite several setbacks, including failing the annual assessment at the company's White Lodge school at 12, and 'being asked to leave' The Arts Educational School in Tring at 15. Rupert continued his training in his home town of Maidenhead under Julie Rose, a former Royal Ballet member, and his tenacity saw him accepted into the Royal Ballet Company in 1999. He sustained a tendon injury as a soloist in 2002, and was out of action for 18 months. Upon full recovery in 2004 he was selected for the principal role of Paris in Romeo and Juliet by prima ballerina Sylvie Guillem, and Aminta in Sylvia by director Dame Monica Mason, which 'proved to be his breakthrough'.
Rupert's potential to enter the canon of great British ballet dancers alongside such greats as Anthony Dowell, David Wall and Jonathan Cope is closely coupled with the fact that his peer and pas-de-deux partner Ms Cuthbertson is also British-born, bringing them progressively more attention as the next Anthony Dowell and Antionette Sibley in the British media. According to Jonathan Cope, "they are very much in sync with each other... I'm quite excited about it".

Vicente San Bruno

Vicente San Bruno Rovira (died April 12, 1817) was a Spanish military officer, infamous for his cruelty during the Chilean War of Independence.
Military career.
Vicente San Bruno was born in Aragon, and in his youth he took minor order in a Franciscan convent. In 1808, San Bruno left the convent and joined the Spanish army as a soldier at the time of the French invasions. He fought bravely during the Peninsular War and won a promotion to officer. On December 25, 1813, he set sail for Peru under the command of Rafael Maroto as a captain in the Queen's Talavera Regiment. They disembarked at Callao on April 24, 1814 to support Viceroy José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, who had been working arduously to maintain his viceroyalty and the bordering territories under Spanish control. Maroto and his troops, which included San Bruno, were placed under the orders of Brigadier Mariano Osorio and sent to Chile, which had risen in rebellion after the French invasion of Spain.
In Chile.
San Bruno and the Talavera Regiment embarked on July 19, 1814, arriving at the naval base of Talcahuano, the nucleus of royalist activity, on August 13. Brigadier Osorio succeeded in organizing local elements into a mobile army of some 5,000 men, of which the troops of the Talavera Regiment were practically the only Spaniards. This circumstance led the Talavera Regiment to manifest a marked disdain for its opponents and the Criollo troops in general, typical of Peninsulares recently arrived in the Americas.
On October 1, the two sides fought in Rancagua, an attempt to prevent the expeditionaries from taking Santiago. The Talavera attacked the enemy fortifications without bothering to send in either scouts or guerrillas. The result was that bombarded by the volley of shots, they were forced to retreat with heavy losses. Nevertheless, by November Spanish control had been reestablished, and San Bruno was put in charge of carrying out the orders of imprisoning the civilians suspected of having helped or sympathised with the independentists. On February 6, 1815, he became infamous when he opened the doors of the public jail of Santiago, and when the prisoners came out, had them all killed under the pretext that they were trying to escape.
After Francisco Marcó del Pont became Royal Governor, San Bruno acquired almost unlimited authority. Two of the squadrons of the Talavera Regiment were sent back to Perú, but San Bruno stayed in Chile as commander of the remaining squadron. On January 17, 1816 he was named president of the "Court of Vigilance and Public Security", which acted as a secret political police. As such he instituted a reign of terror in order to quash any possible rebellion.
Death.
San Bruno was captured during the Battle of Chacabuco (February 12, 1817), while he was trying to organize the resistance. He was taken to Santiago, where the populace tried to lynch him. The victors refused to treat him as a prisoner of war, and he was instead tried as a common criminal on March 6, sentenced to death on April 10 and executed on the main square of Santiago on April 12.

K. E. Madanna

Kambalapadu Ediga Madanna (28 May 1902 – 5 May 1994), well known as K.E. Madanna, was a social activist and political leader who fought against the Rayalaseema factionists and forward castes dominations in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh in India to bring social change and political awareness among the oppressed and weaker sections of the Rayalaseema people, particularly among Backward Castes, Muslims, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes during both pre-independence and post-independence period of India.

Oxford Scientific Films

Oxford Scientific Films (OSF) is a British company that produces natural history and documentary programmes. Founded on 8 July 1968 by noted documentary filmmaker Gerald Thompson, the independent film company broke new ground in the world of documentaries, using new filming techniques and capturing footage of never before filmed activities of its various subjects. In 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was sold to Circle Communications, where it retained its own identity as a division within the company. The following year, Circle Communications was taken over by Southern Star Entertainment UK. Under the new ownership, Oxford Scientific Films continued to enhance its reputation for innovative film-making, producing multiple award-winning series and films, including the highly acclaimed Animal Planet series, "Meerkat Manor".
In March 2008, Southern Star merged its Sydney-based factual business division into the Oxford Scientific Films division, retaining the brand name for specialist documentaries, while using "Southern Star Factual" as the brand name for its features and entertainment style documentaries. When Southern Star was sold to Endemol, Oxford Scientific Films was retained by parent company Fairfax Media. In 2011 Oxford Scientific Films was acquired by Boom Pictures Productions, who own a 70% share of the company.
History.
Formation and growth.
In 1967, cinemicrophotography pioneer, professional film maker, and Oxford University lecturer Gerald Thompson, was approached by the Ealing Corporation of Harvard about expanding its catalog of short educational films. Universal Education and Visual Arts, a New York, company also was interested in talking with Thompson about the works he'd produced. Thompson and five of his associates and former students: Peter Parks, who worked with plankton; John Paling, a fish specialist who worked with Parks; recent Oxford graduate Sean Morris; zoologist John Cooke; and Eric Skinner, who assisted Thompson with his films, wanted to form an independent film company. Thompson and Parks travelled to America to meet with the two companies to show their work. At the end of the meeting, they told the head of the company about their desire to open their own company and, impressed with the films he'd seen, he offered to finance them for the first three years and give them the funds to build a place to work.
When they returned to the United Kingdom, Thompson sold them a quarter acre of his garden, at a steeply discounted price, to be the home for the new building. They formed Oxford Scientific Films, taking part of the name from Parks' existing company Oxford Biological Films. Thompson, Parks, Morris, Paling, and Thompson's son David, headed the new company, which began operating on 8 July 1968. Thompson remained at his position at Oxford University while the company building was being completed, while the other four travelled to America to make the film loops for Ealing. Thompson resigned from the university on 2 September 1969, taking on the work at Oxford Scientific Films full time.
The company focused initially on filming nature at a microscopic level, including insect and aquatic wildlife. Using specialised equipment and camera techniques the developed themselves, the company gained fame for its ability to record never before seen footage of the natural world. Its cinematographers became experts in micro, macro, snorkel, slow-motion and time-lapse photography. As the company grew, it expanded into other innovating filming and post-production techniques, and moved from creating short loops to creating television programmes and series, commercials, and feature films.
Southern Star acquisition.
In September 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was purchased by film and television rights company Circle Communications for £3.9 million. £3.85 million of the purchase price was paid in cash, with the rest paid through a stock exchange. Less than a year later, in May 1997, Australia-based Southern Star Entertainment made a £8.3 million take over bid for Circle Communications, due to its distribution business, strong catalog, and the company's drama and factual production business. Oxford Scientific Films, which had retained its own identity under Circle Communications, became a core division of Southern Star Entertainment. 
On 4 December 2003, Oxford Scientific's extensive libraries of over 350,000 still images and over 2,000 of film footage libraries were acquired by Photolibrary. The acquisition was done as a share exchange,with Photolibrary acquiring shares in Oxford Scientific Films Limited, and Southern Star paying A$1 million to purchase a 46.46% equity in Photolibrary. Photolibrary retained existing employees of the library divisions, and continues using the names "Oxford Scientific" and "OSF" in promoting the libraries. Southern Star retained full control of Oxford Scientific Films production unit, and through that unit, continues supplying images and footage to the Photolibrary.
In March 2008, parent company Southern Star Group merged its Sydney-based "factual business unit" into the Oxford Scientific Films division. The merged company now uses two brands, with the existing Oxford Scientific Films name being used for its "specialist factual programmes", while the Southern Star Factual brand will be used for "features and factual entertainment shows."
Notable works.
Oxford Scientific Films has produced numerous award winning programmes and films. In 1998, its film "The Forbidden Fruit" produced for the BBC's long-running series "The Natural World" and WNET Nature, won seven industry awards. "Heroes of the High Frontier", produced as a National Geographic Special, won four awards and was a finalist for the Best of the Show Grand Award Trophy at the New York Festivals.
In 2005, the company launched "Meerkat Manor", a docu-drama commissioned for Animal Planet. The series has since become Animal Planet's highest rated series, and has been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Awards and was a finalist at the 2006 Wildscreen Festival It won multiple awards at the 2006 Omni Awards and 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Gala. The series is also noted for capturing never before seen aspects of the lives of meerkats, being the first to capture meerkat infanticide on film, and for expanding the boundaries of the documentary genre.

Tomás Mascardo

Tomas Mascardo (October 9, 1871 – July 7, 1932) was a Filipino general during the Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War. He joined the fight against the Spaniards since the start of the revolution. He later became a one-term governor of Cavite from 1910 to 1912.
Biography.
Early years.
Mascardo was born in the town of Kawit, Cavite province to Valentin Mascardo and Dolores Echenique. The affluent couple, a landowner and a rice dealer, respectively, had a total of seven children. Tomas finished his teacher's diploma from Escuela Normal in Manila and became a teacher at the barrio school of Halang in Amadeo, Cavite.
Philippine revolution.
Mascardo joined the revolution against the Spaniards from the beginning. He became the chief of the revolutionary intelligence service in Manila, succeeding Miguel Liedo who was captured and sentenced to death by the Spaniards. He was ordered by General Emilio Aguinaldo to attack a Spanish stronghold in Tanauan, Batangas, where the general was awed by Mascardo’s courage. In time, he was promoted to brigadier general. Mascardo, together with his commander, General Edilberto Evangelista, fought at the Battle of Zapote Bridge on February 17, 1897 where Evangelista was killed and Mascardo, wounded.
War against the Americans.
During the Philippine-American War, Mascardo was assigned as commanding general of the revolutionary forces in Pampanga, Bataan and Zambales provinces with barracks in Bagac, Bataan. Following Aguinaldo's capture by the Americans on March 23, 1901 in Palanan, Isabela, he ordered a subordinate Major Manuel L. Quezon to surrender as well so he can verify the capture and if so, consult Aguinaldo for final orders as there was also an order for Mascardo to surrender. Quezon was able to meet Aguinaldo in a room at the Malacañang Palace where he was detained. After relaying Mascardo’s message, Aguinaldo instructed Quezon that the decision to surrender is up to Mascardo, himself. On May 15, 1901, he surrendered to the Americans. He calculated that their deficiency in weaponry would mean sure defeat from the well-armed Americans.
Political career and death.
Mascardo returned to Cavite following his release by the Americans. He was influenced to enter politics, and won the gubernatorial seat of Cavite, a post he held from 1910 to 1912. He retired and lived a private life after only one term. On July 7, 1932, he died from a heart disease.
Personal life.
Tomas Mascardo was married to Carmen Topacio of Imus, Cavite. The couple had eight children - Modesto, Dominador (who became a general), Petra, Pura, Jaime, Tomas, Salvador (a former collector of customs at the Manila International Airport), and Emiliano.

Sven Kmetsch

Sven Kmetsch (born 13 August 1970 in Bautzen, Saxony) is a retired German footballer, who played as a defensive midfielder.
Club career.
Including his youth career, Kmetsch spent 14 years at Dynamo Dresden, winning the double in his last season, with one of his midfield teammates being Matthias Sammer. After the German reunification, he would play with the team four consecutive years in the Bundesliga, his competition debut coming on 14 September 1991, in a 3–0 home win against SG Wattenscheid 09.
After Dynamo's double relegation in 1995, Kmetsch spent three seasons with Hamburger SV, enjoying his best year in 1996–97 – 32 games, four goals – but his team could only rank 13th. He subsequently signed for FC Schalke 04, where he would win two consecutive German Cups, being however mostly a backup player during his seven-year spell.
After no appearances whatsoever from 2003–05 combined, Kmetsch retired, having various spells as coach of Schalke's second team. After being released in early 2010, he held talks with TSV Germania Windeck and Bayer Leverkusen II to join Heiko Scholz's coaching staff.
International career.
Kmetsch gained two caps for Germany, his debut coming on 10 September 1997, in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Armenia, in Dortmund: at half-time, with the score at 0–0 (eventually 4–0), he was replaced by another debutee, Lars Ricken.
His second and final appearance was made five months later, in a friendly with Oman (another start, in a 2–0 win).

Anna Shuttleworth

Anna Shuttleworth (born 1927) is a cellist from the United Kingdom. She studied cello with Ivor James and Harvey Phillips at the Royal College of Music and later became a professor at the same college. Her pupils have included Alexander Baillie, Martin Johnson, Natalie Clein, František Brikcius and Kathy Hampson (nee Jewell).
Family background.
Anna Shuttleworth was born in Bournemouth on 2 May 1927, the only child of a retired Indian Civil Service father and a Polish-Irish mother.
Studying the Cello.
In 1943, Shuttleworth went to study the cello at the Royal College of Music (RCM) as a scholar. There she learned with Ivor James and Harvey Philips. While at the RCM, Anna became a founding member of the Vivien Hind String Quartet, an ensemble that she played with for a number of years. After leaving the RCM her friend Joan Dickson organised for the cellist Enrico Mainardi to give lessons in London for which Anna took part. She also continued her studies with Franz Walter in Geneva.
Shortly after leaving college, Anna was invited to play at the Newbury Festival with the Newbury String Players, both in the orchestra and later as a soloist. This initiated a long friendship with the family of Gerald Finzi and their musical circle, including Ursula and Ralph Vaughan Williams. This period also witnessed a richly varied freelance career, playing in a number of festival orchestras, as a chamber musician and soloist. She was once affectionately referred to as “The Swellest Cellist” by Vaughan Williams.
In 1953, at the recommendation of the composer Herbert Howells, Anna entered for the Boise scholarship and in 1954 was awarded a substantial sum to further her cello studies. This she used to study with Mainardi in Salzburg and Rome, and with Pablo Casals in Zermatt and Prades.
Personal life.
Anna Shuttleworth has been married twice, first time to Noel Taylor, a fellow cellist, in 1957, and the second time to David Sellen, a biophysics researcher, since 1973.
Professional life.
In the 1960s, Anna’s career took off and she became a member of several ensembles and performed for many BBC broadcasts. In 1964 Novello published “Learning the cello” which Anna wrote jointly with Hugo Cole. Anna had a lesson with Rostropovich who complimented Anna on her beautiful cello sound and musicianship. This is also the year when she is invited to teach the cello at the Junior Department at the RCM, followed by the appointment to the Senior Department in 1967. In 1968 she is approved as an Associated Board examiner and also buys her very first Renault 4, the car that was to become her habitual transport, travelling around the country.
The 1970s was Anna’s golden period and through the connection with Hilary Finzi, Jacqueline du Pré’s sister, Anna was allowed to play on Jacqui’s Davidov Stradivarius for two years. She became a “sought after” cello professor at the RCM and taught many of today’s well-known musicians, including Adrian Brendel, Alexander Baillie, Clare Finzi, Elizabeth Wilson and Jonathan del Mar. But, as Anna felt like she had neglected her academic career, and partly to better understand David’s work at the Leeds University, she took an Open University course 1971-75 and was awarded a BA (Hons) degree in 1975. In 1972 Anna put Stuart Lowe (a keen amateur cellist) in contact with Sue Jennings (one of Anna’s cello students at the RCM) and later Stuart and Sue married. Later Anna taught Matthew, Daniel and Time Lowe at Sue’s request. Anna and Sue developed a longstanding teaching relationship and together, and with the Lowe family members and Alexander Baillie, they created “Gathering of the Clans”, a long running cello course with teachers such as Baillie and Johannes Goritzki as well as Alexander teachers/cellists Vivien Mackie and Rhuna Martin. Other cellists included Joan Dickson, Amanda Truelove, Paul Feehan, Sasha Boyarsky, Lowri Blake, Andreas Burzik, Melissa Phelps, Louise Hopkins, and Moray Welsh.
Since the 1960s Anna has performed many successful piano and cello recitals with some of the leading pianists in Britain, including Bernard Roberts, Ian Brown, Martin Roscoe and John Thwaites. Since leaving the RCM in the late 1940s Anna has been a member of numerous chamber music ensembles including a string trio with Elisabeth Watson (viola), Georgian String Quartet, Leonardo Trio (first with David Roth, later with Maureen Smith, violin and with Ian Brown, piano), London Harpsichord Ensemble, Glickman Trio and Aulos Ensemble. When in London she knew Sylvia Cleaver who in 1964 asked Anna to become the principal cellist of the Midland Sinfonia Orchestra (later renamed the English Sinfonia). She held this post until she retired from the orchestra in 1996. Apart from this, Anna has worked with many orchestras over the years such as the Alexandra Orchestra (founded by Denys Darlow) which later became the Tilford Bach Orchestra, Chelsea Opera Group, Kalmar Orchestra, Sadler’s Wells Opera Orchestra (now English National Opera) and Orchestra d'Amici.
Music Courses and Travel.
Anna has always loved to travel and has spent many holidays around the world with a particular fondness for Scandinavia. In the early seventies, at Jacqueline du Pré's suggestion, the Swedish cellist Frans Helmerson stayed at Anna’s house and they became friends. Then while teaching at the Great Missenden Summer course in Berkshire, Anna met the Swedish musical Frankmar family who brought her over to Sweden for various summer courses. There she met cellists Ludwig Frankmar and Tomas Sterner who came to study with her in London. In 1979 Tomas became her cello student at the RCM and, in 2009, has published her memoirs. Tomas and Anna also helped to organise two string courses in Guernsey in the early 1980s.
In 1985, while on tour with the Associated Board in Malaysia, Anna met Toya, a Batik artist living in Penang, and his nephew Kia. Anna helped both of them, firstly by organising exhibitions of Toya’s work in England and secondly by sponsoring Kia to study at Leeds University, where he is now on the staff. In 1986 she again worked for the Associated Board, examining in New Zealand.
Teaching the Cello.
Anna’s teaching career evolved over the years. From initially teaching at independent schools and later being appointed a professor at the RCM she eventually took on many teaching positions in England, including Canterbury, Leeds and students from York University, as well as at Leeds Girls High School. On top of this she had many private pupils. In 1994, Anna’s teaching became more widely known when her pupil, Natalie Clein, won both the UK and European Young Musician of the Year competitions. Although this was at a time when Anna was near retirement, she was now very much a sought after teacher. Much later she taught the very talented Czech cellist Frantisek Brikcius, who came to Leeds University as an Erasmus scholar.
In retirement Anna has slowed down but not yet stopped. She made her final cello and piano duo recitals in 2003 and now plays the Treble and Bass Viols and sings early music. She teaches the cello if requested.
In 2008 Anna was awarded an Honorary Membership of the Royal College of Music from Prince Charles. This follows a number of years when she has supported the RCM and also created a cello prize in her own name.
Publications.
Anna Shuttleworth has co-written a cello method for young cellists aged 10 and upwards
, and her memoirs were published in July 2009
Recordings.
Anna Shuttleworth has made several recordings with Alfred Deller (counter-tenor). For example, Purcell's Ode for St. Cecilia's Day and Purcell's Te Deum and Jubilate Deo

Casino (video game)

Casino is an Atari 2600 video game programmed by Bob Whitehead and released in 1978. Supporting up to four players, the game was controlled by the Atari Paddles.
Gameplay.
Displayed from an overhead perspective, there are three card games to choose from: blackjack, five-card stud poker, and poker solitaire. Except for poker solitaire, each game always has the computer as the dealer, and bets are made by rotating the wheel on the controller and then pressing the button.
There are two different blackjack games: Game 1 allows for up to two players and hand splitting, and Game 2 allows for up to four players yet there is no hand splitting. There are variations in the game depending on the setting of the difficulty switches. If the left switch is set to "A", the computer will shuffle after 34 hands, and if set to "B", the computer will shuffle after every hand. If the right switch is set to "A", the dealer will stay (not draw anymore cards) after drawing a 17, and if set to "B", the computer will stay after drawing an 18 or better. Furthermore, the player will win if he draws the maximum amount of cards; in Game 1, that is three or eight hits, and in Game 2, three hits.
Stud poker, which comprises Game 3, allows for up to four players. The computer, as the dealer, issues a card to each of the players and itself. Before the first card is dealt, and after each subsequent hand, until five cards have been dealt, each player must either make a bet or fold. If the left difficulty switch is set to "A", the dealer's first card is dealt face down; otherwise, it is dealt face up; likewise for the right difficulty switch for each player.
Poker solitaire is different in that no bets are made and there is no dealer; rather, the goal is to arrange cards to create the best twelve poker hands in 25 cards, with five rows, five columns, and the two diagonals. Points are scored depending on the hands created, with a pair yielding 10 points and a royal flush yielding 500 points. The highest possible score is 3340 points. The difficulty switches have no effect in this game.
Ports.
"Casino" was made available on Microsoft's "Game Room" service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs in June 2010.

Sebastian Redford

Sebastian Redford (27 April 1701 – 2 January 1763) was an English Jesuit.
Life.
Educated at St. Omer, Watten, and Liège, he became a Jesuit and lived as chaplain with the Wrights of Kelvedon, then with the Herberts of Powis (1733–48).
Redford was much trusted by the second Marquess of Powis (died 1745), but the third was unfriendly. When he died (1748), a Protestant succeeded, the chaplaincy lapsed, and Redford had, as he says, "to rue the ruin" of his former flock. He was next stationed at Croxteth, the seat of Lord Molineux.
Works.
While at Croxteth, he published "An important Enquiry; or the Nature of Church Reformation fully considered" (1751). The book was a success, but the excise officers seized and destroyed 400 copies, the last half of the edition. A second and enlarged edition appeared in 1758. 
Many Redford's letters were preserved by the English Jesuits.

Helix of sustainability

The helix of sustainability is a concept coined to help manufacturing industry move to more sustainable practices by mapping its models of raw material use and reuse onto those of nature.The environmental benefits of the use crop origin sustainable materials have been assumed to be self-evident, but as the debate on food vs fuel shows, the whole product life cycle must be examined in the light of social and environmental effects in addition to technical suitability and profitability. 
The helix of sustainability is a concept created as a representation of the total systems approach to gain full advantage from manufacturing with sustainable materials, particularly biopolymers and biocomposites. In 2004 the concept was presented by Professor John Wood, then Chair of the Materials Foresight Panel at a DTI event hosted by the then Secretary of State for Industry (Jacqui Smith). In the same year it was also used in the European Science Foundation exploratory workshop on environmentally friendly composites. 
The advantages of working with crop origin raw materials are readily observed if the social and environmental impacts are considered as well as monetary cost (the Triple bottom line), and the helix of sustainability helps to demonstrate this. For the full potential of biopolymers to be realised it is essential that attention is paid to every aspect of the manufacturing process from design (how to cope with the incertainties in properties associated with crop origin materials?), manufacture (can existing technologies be used?), through to end-of-life (can the redundant article be fed back into the materials cycle?). 
The entire supply chain must be considered because decisions taken at the design stage have significant effects right through the life of an article. Low cost assembly techniques (e.g. snap-fits) may make dismantling or repair uneconomical. However, if say, an easy-to-dismantle car is built, will there be any effect on the ability of the vehicle to absorb energy in a crash? At an even more fundamental level, what will be the social and environmental of the change in crop growing patterns. This low environmental impact approach to manufacturing is seen as an extension of waste reduction techniques such as lean manufacturing. 
Conventional cycles of use and reuse are circular. Consider the mechanical recovery of conventional polymers. A complex infrastructure is needed to recover the material at the end of an article's useful life. At the end of an article's life - say a PET carbonated drink bottle, the article must be separated from the waste stream, either by the consumer who throws it away, or by manual labour at the rubbish dump. It must then be transported to some facility to be reprocessed (using more labour and energy) back into a raw material. The heat and shear forces associated with the process of remanufacture tends to produce material with slightly degraded properties compared to the original material.
For sustainable material articles there is not such a great requirement for a dedicated recovery infrastructure. If a litter lout throws a crop origin biodegradable article on the ground, it will ultimately biodegrade into humus, water, and non-fossil CO2. If the article is placed into a compostable waste stream, the humus can then be used as fertiliser for the next generation of crops, there is also no requirement to sort biopolymer articles as there is with fossil polymer recycling. Note difference between landfill and compost - the limited biological activity in landfill is slow, and mostly resulting in the production of methane, whereas composting is a rapid aerobic process resulting in humus, water and non-fossil CO2. The energy bill for breaking down biodegradables into the fundamental building block molecules, and then reassembling them into usable raw materials is large, but is uses direct solar energy rather than metered electricity. There is also no loss of properties with successive journeys through the cycle.

Domenico Pacini

Domenico Pacini (Marino, February 20, 1878 – Rome, May 23, 1934) was an Italian physicist noted for his contributions to the discovery of cosmic rays.
Biography.
He graduated in Physics at the University of Rome in 1902. Assistant at the ""Regio Ufficio Centrale di Meteorologia e di Geodinamica"" (Italian Agency of Meteorology and Geodynamics) from 1905 to 1927. Teacher of Geophysics from 1915 to 1925 at the University of Rome, then professor of Experimental physics at the University of Bari from 1928.
It had been observed that an electroscope in a vessel at earth potential gradually lost its charge, even if very carefully insulated, due to the ionization of the air. Pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization on mountains, over a lake, over the sea, and underwater. In an experiment performed in June 1911, Pacini concluded that ionization underwater was significantly lower than on the sea surface. He could then demonstrate that a certain part of the ionization itself must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth, thus contributing to the discovery of cosmic rays.
