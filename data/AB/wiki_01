History of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education

Early years.
The Institute was founded on 6 September 1943 by a group of local businessmen led by Eugenio Garza Sada, a moneyed heir of a brewing conglomerate who was interested in creating an institution that could provide highly skilled personnel — both university graduates and technicians— to the booming Monterrey corporations of the 1940s. The group was structured into a non-profit organization called "Enseñanza e Investigación Superior A.C. (EISAC)" and recruited several academicians led by León Ávalos y Vez, an MIT alumnus and then Director-General of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the National Polytechnic Institute, who designed its first academic programs and served as its first Director-General.
In its early years the Institute operated at Abasolo 858 Oriente in a large, two-story house located a block and a half away from Zaragoza Square, behind the city's Metropolitan Cathedral. As its first facilities soon proved to be insufficient, it started renting out adjacent buildings and by 1945 it became apparent that a university campus was necessary. For that reason, a master plan was commissioned to Enrique de la Mora and on 3 February 1947 what would later be known as its Monterrey Campus was inaugurated by Mexican President Miguel Alemán Valdés.
Because the operations of the local companies were highly reliant on U.S. markets, investments, and technology; internationalization became one of its earliest priorities. In 1950 it became the first foreign university in history to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), one of the six regional accreditation agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education. Its foreign accreditation would end up being a decisive influence in its development, as it was forced to submit itself to external evaluation earlier than most Mexican universities (1961) and unlocked additional sources of revenue, such as tuition funds from foreign students interested in taking summer courses in Mexico for full-academic credit.
Expansion.
Its growth outside the city of Monterrey began in the late-1960s, when both its rector and head of academics lobbied for expansion. A first attempt, funded a few years earlier by several businessmen from Mexicali, Baja California, was staffed and organized by the Institute but faced opposition from the Board of Trustees once the federal government refused any additional subsidy and members of the Board cast doubt on its ability to gets funds as an out-of-state university. At the end the project was renamed "Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior (CETYS)" and grew into a fully independent institution.
Aside from the CETYS experioment and the 150 hectares bought in 1951 for the agricultural program's experimental facilities in nearby Apodaca, Nuevo León, no other expansion outside Monterrey was attempted until 1967, when a school of maritime studies was built in the port of Guaymas, Sonora. Shortly thereafter, premises were built in Obregón and courses began to be offered in Mexico City. Those premises and the ones that followed, then called external units, were fully dependant of the Monterrey Campus until 1984, when they were restructured as semi-independent campuses and reorganized in regional rectorates ("see Organization).
In 1987, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools demanded faculty members with doctorate degrees to lecture 25% of its undergraduate and 100% of its postgraduate courses, the Institute invested considerably in both distance learning and computer network technologies and training, effectively becoming, on 1 February 1989, the first university ever connected to the Internet in both Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world. Such efforts contributed to the creation of its Virtual University a few years later and allowed it to become the first country-code top level domain registry in Mexico; first by itself from 1989 to 1995, and then as a major shareholder of "NIC Mexico", the current national registry.

Compressed Hare

"Compressed Hare" is a Bugs Bunny cartoon. It stars Wile E. Coyote and Bugs Bunny (in their fourth pairing), and was released on July 29, 1961. That was the final time in a first-run Golden Age short in which Wile E. Coyote speaks.
Plot.
Wile E. Coyote leaves a telephone at the hole of his neighbor, Bugs Bunny. He calls, asking to borrow a cup of diced carrots. Bugs' whiskers twitch as he sarcastically looks at Wile's mailbox ("Wile E. Coyote - Genius"), and realizes what he's up against. He then mocks him: "Are you in, genius? Are you in, capable? In, solent? In, describable? In, bearable?..." Wile grabs Bugs and ties him to a stake as he prepares to cook Bugs, but Bugs gets the upper hand by hopping on the floorboards, setting off a wine cork that, after it ricochets around the room, triggers Wile's wall bed that crushes the Coyote (All to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse). Bugs makes his getaway and hops back to his hole.
Wile then tries a vacuum cleaner to suck up the rabbit, getting a dynamite decoy instead, before the decoy explodes, he says "well, the boy has talent"; a cannon shot, which Bugs re-directs at the Coyote thanks to some underground pipes (Coyote: "Well, even a genius can have an off-day"); and "Quick-Drying Cement". The cement dries into a cylindrical block. As Wile E. laughs, saying "What a wonderful way to "cement" a friendship.", he runs right into the block, which tips over on top of him. Bugs then pops out and says "Well, now he has "concrete" evidence that I'm a good neighbor".
The final attempt is a 10 billion-volt electric magnet, which Wile E. Coyote turns on after leaving a metal carrot in Bugs' hole (hoping the bunny can eat the carrot and then be pulled by the magnet to his waiting predator). Bugs tricks him and sends the carrot right back at Wile E. Upon releasing the carrot, Bugs' mailbox is also pulled towards the magnet, hitting Wile E. right in the face. To further batter Wile E., Bugs throws out an iron, a frying pan, a garbage bin, and a mallet, as well as his bed and kitchen stove, all of which are attracted to the magnet. However, neither Bugs nor Wile E. expects the magnet to attract everything else with metal properties (including, but not limited to: barbed wire, street lamps, cars, bulldozers, buses, an ocean liner, the Eiffel Tower, satellites, and, finally, a Mercury rocket trying to blast off into space) their way. The rocket lodges itself in Wile's cave and then explodes along with everything else the magnet attracted, blasting Wile E. Coyote into oblivion as Bugs watches from his hole. All Bugs himself can do is remark "One thing's for sure: we're the first country to get a coyote into orbit".

Congo at the 2008 Summer Olympics

The Republic of the Congo sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.
Athletics.
Ghyd-Kermeliss-Holly Olonghot represented the Republic of the Congo in the men's 100 meters races at the Beijing Olympics, and was the only athlete from the Republic of the Congo participating in a track event. Born in the national capital Brazzaville in 1986, Olonghot was 22 years old at the time of the Beijing Olympics. He had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The Congolese runner competed in the eight-person fourth heat during the August 14 qualification round. He finished the race in 11.01 seconds, placing seventh in the heat ahead of Afghan athlete Masoud Azizi (11.45 seconds) and behind Burkina Faso's Idrissa Sanou (10.63 seconds) in a heat dominated by Michael Frater of Jamaica (10.15 seconds) and Pierre Browne of Canada (10.22 seconds). Of the 80 athletes who competed in the races, Ghyd-Kermeliss-Holly Olonghot placed 65th. He did not advance to later rounds.
Pamela Mouele-Mboussi competed on the behalf of the Republic of the Congo at the Beijing Olympics as its only field athlete at those games. Born in Brazzaville in May 1988, Mouele-Mboussi was 20 years old when she competed at her event at the Beijing Olympics. The Congolese athlete had not previously competed at any Olympic games. During the qualifying round of women's long jump, which took place on August 18, Mouele-Mboussi competed against 20 athletes in the first group. The Congolese long jumper fouled on her first attempt, but jumped 5.94 meters on her second (temporarily placing her ranking at 14th) and boosted her score further by jumping 6.06 meters on her last attempt. With a score of 6.06 meters, Pamela Mouele-Mboussi ranked 17th out of the 19 athletes who ranked in the event. Mouele-Mboussi ranked directly ahead of Rhonda Watkins of Trinidad and Tobago (5.88 meters) and directly behind Volha Cyargeenka of Belarus (6.25 meters) in a heat led by Brazil's Maurren Higa Maggi (6.79 meters) and Sweden's Carolina Klüft (6.70 meters). Of the 38 finishing athletes in the qualifying round, Mouele-Mboussi ranked 35th. She did not advance to later rounds.
Swimming.
Emile Rony Bakale competed for the Republic of the Congo as its only swimmer at the Beijing games, and participated in the men's 100 meters freestyle. Born in 1987 and brother of fellow Congolese Olympian Monika Bakale, Rony Bakale first competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece as a 16 year old in the men's 50 meters freestyle. At the age of 20, he returned to the Olympics, but not to the men's 50 meters freestyle. During the preliminary rounds of his event, Bakale competed in the first heat against two other athletes. The Congolese swimmer finished the event in 55.08 seconds, placing first in his heat ahead of Bolivia's Miguel Angel Navarro (56.89 seconds) and Libya's Sofyan El Gadi (57.89 seconds). Of the 64 athletes who finished the event's preliminary round, Bakale finished 62nd. He did not advance to later rounds.
Table tennis.
Suraju Saka was one of the Republic of the Congo's competitors in table tennis at the Beijing Olympics. He was born in Nigeria in 1976 and entered the Olympics in 2008 on Brazzaville's behalf at the age of 32. Suraju Saka had not previously competed at any Olympic games. During the first round of the event, which took place on August 19, Saka faced Lucjan Blaszczyk of Poland in the ninth match. In the first match, Saka lost 11–9; he lost 11–3 in the second; 13–11 in the third; and 11–2 in the final match. Having lost all four games to his Polish opponent, Saka was defeated and did not advance to later rounds.
Yang Fen competed under the flag of the Republic of the Congo at the Beijing Olympics as one of its table tennis players. Born in Hubei Province in central China in 1982, Yang was 26 years old at the time of her participation in the Beijing games. She had not previously competed at any Olympic games. At the preliminary round of the event, which took place on August 17, Yang faced the United States' Crystal Huang. During the first game, Yang defeated Huang 11–6; Yang defeated the American again 11–4 on the second round, but lost to Huang in the third round 6–11. The Congolese athlete won the fourth game 11–9, but lost the next two games 8–11. However, her victory in the seventh game at 11–7 secured her victory and progression to the next round. The first round of the event took place on August 19, with Yang in the first match challenging Elizabeta Samara of Romania. Samara defeated Yang in the first two games (11–4 then 11–2). The Congolese table tennis player won the third game 6–11, but lost the next two games (11–4 and 11–6) and, having lost four games, was defeated. Yang Fen did not advance to later rounds.

Tax protester Sixteenth Amendment arguments

Tax protester Sixteenth Amendment arguments are assertions that the imposition of the U.S. federal income tax is illegal because the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reads ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration,"" was never properly ratified, or that the amendment provides no power to tax income. Proper ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment is disputed by tax protesters who argue that the quoted text of the Amendment differed from the text proposed by Congress, or that Ohio was not a State during ratification. Sixteenth Amendment ratification arguments have been rejected in every court case where they have been raised and have been identified as legally frivolous.
Some protesters have argued that because the Sixteenth Amendment does not contain the words "repeal" or "repealed", the Amendment is ineffective to change the law. Others argue that due to language in "Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.", the income tax is an unconstitutional direct tax that should be apportioned (divided equally amongst the population of the various states). Several tax protesters assert that the Congress has no constitutional power to tax labor or income from labor, citing a variety of court cases. These arguments include claims that the word "income" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment cannot be interpreted as applying to wages; that wages are not income because labor is exchanged for them; that taxing wages violates individuals' right to property, and several others. Another argument raised is that because the federal income tax is progressive, the discriminations and inequalities created by the tax should render the tax unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Such arguments have been ruled without merit under contemporary jurisprudence.
Sixteenth Amendment ratification.
Many tax protesters contend that the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was never properly ratified (see, e.g., Devvy Kidd).
The "non-ratification" argument was presented by defendant James Walter Scott in the 1975 case of "United States v. Scott", some sixty-two years after the ratification. In "Scott", the defendant -- who called himself a "national tax resistance leader" -- had been convicted of willful failure to file federal income tax returns for the years 1969 through 1972, and the conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In the 1977 case of "Ex parte Tammen", the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted testimony in the case to the effect that taxpayer Bob Tammen had become involved with a group called "United Tax Action Patriots," a group that took the position "that the Sixteenth Amendment was improperly passed and therefore invalid..." The specific issue of the validity of the ratification of the Amendment was neither presented to nor decided by the court in the "Tammen" case.
After the "Scott" and "Tammen" decisions, two lines of court cases eventually developed. The first group of cases deals with the claims of William J. Benson, co-author of the book "The Law That Never Was" (1985). The second line of cases involves the contention that Ohio was not a state in 1913 at the time of the ratification.
Benson contentions.
The William J. Benson contention is essentially that the legislatures of various states passed ratifying resolutions in which the quoted text of the Amendment differed from the text proposed by Congress in terms of capitalization, spelling of words, or punctuation marks (e.g. semi-colons instead of commas), and that these differences made the ratification invalid. Benson makes other assertions including claims that one or more states rejected the Amendment and that the state or states were falsely reported as having ratified the Amendment. As explained below, the Benson arguments have been rejected in every court case where they have been raised, and were explicitly ruled to be fraudulent in 2007.
Benson contended that in Kentucky, the legislature acted on the amendment without having received it from the governor, and that the governor of the state was to transmit the proposed amendment to the state legislature. Benson also contended that the version of the amendment that the Kentucky legislature made up and acted upon omitted the words "on income" from the text, and that the legislature therefore was not even voting on an income tax. Benson asserted that once this error was corrected, the Kentucky senate rejected the amendment, although Philander Knox counted Kentucky as having approved it.
Benson also contended that in Oklahoma, the legislature changed the wording of the amendment so that its meaning was virtually the opposite of what was intended by Congress, and that this was the version they sent back to Knox. Benson alleged that Knox counted Oklahoma as having approved it, despite a memo from his chief legal counsel, Reuben Clark, that states were not allowed to change the proposal in any way.
Benson argued that attorneys who studied the subject had agreed that Kentucky and Oklahoma should not have been counted as approvals by Philander Knox, and that if any state could be shown to have violated its own state constitution or laws in its approval process, then that state's approval would have to be thrown out.
The earliest reported court cases where Benson's arguments were actually raised appear to be "United States v. Wojtas" Benson testified in the "House" case to no avail. The Benson contention was comprehensively addressed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in "United States v. Thomas":
Benson was unsuccessful with his Sixteenth Amendment argument when he had his own legal problems. He was prosecuted for tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns. The court rejected his Sixteenth Amendment "non-ratification" argument in "United States v. Benson". William J. Benson was convicted of tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns in connection with over $100,000 of unreported income, and his conviction was upheld on appeal. He was sentenced to four years in prison and five years of probation.
On December 17, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that Benson's non-ratification argument constituted a "fraud perpetrated by Benson" that had "caused needless confusion and a waste of the customers' and the IRS' time and resources." The court stated: "Benson has failed to point to evidence that would create a genuinely disputed fact regarding whether the Sixteenth Amendment was properly ratified or whether United States Citizens are legally obligated to pay federal taxes." The court ruled that "Benson's position has no merit and he has used his fraudulent tax advice to deceive other citizens and profit from it" in violation of . The court granted an injunction under prohibiting Benson from promoting the theories in Benson's "Reliance Defense Package" (containing the non-ratification argument), which the court referred to as "false and fraudulent advice concerning the payment of federal taxes."
Benson appealed that decision, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit also ruled against Benson. The Court of Appeals stated:
The Court of Appeals also ruled that the government could obtain a ruling ordering Benson to turn his customer list over to the government. Benson petitioned the United States Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court rejected his petition on November 30, 2009.
In "Stubbs v. Commissioner", Charles Stubbs argued that he had no Federal income tax liability because the Sixteenth Amendment had not been ratified properly. The Court rejected that argument, stating: "...we find Stubbs' argument without merit. Notification by a state that it has ratified an amendment is binding upon the Secretary of State, and his official certification of ratification is conclusive upon the courts... Stubbs' assertion of fraudulent behavior on the part of the Secretary of State in certifying ratification does not remove the Secretary's determination from this conclusive effect..." "United States v. Sitka"; and "United States v. Stahl". The non-ratification argument has been specifically deemed legally frivolous in "Brown v. Commissioner"; "Lysiak v. Commissioner"; and "Miller v. United States".
Ohio's statehood.
Another argument made by some tax protesters is that because the United States Congress did not pass an official proclamation (Pub. L. 204) recognizing the date of Ohio's 1803 admission to statehood until 1953 (see ), Ohio was not a state until 1953 and therefore the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified. The earliest reported court case where this argument was raised appears to be "Ivey v. United States", some sixty-three years after the ratification and 173 years after Ohio's admission as a state. This argument was rejected in the "Ivey" case, and has been uniformly rejected by the courts. See also "McMullen v. United States", "McCoy v. Alexander", "Lorre v. Alexander", "McKenney v. Blumenthal" and "Knoblauch v. Commissioner". Further, even if Ohio's ratification was not valid, the Amendment was ratified by 41 other states, well in excess of the 36 needed for it to be properly ratified.
In "Baker v. Commissioner", the court stated:
The argument that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified and variations of this argument have been officially identified as legally frivolous federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a). The United States continues to recognize 1803 as the date when Ohio became a state, President Thomas Jefferson having signed, on February 19, 1803, an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and proposed state constitution. The resolution regarding this admission signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 recognizes March 1, 1803 as the date of Ohio's admittance into the Union.
Sixteenth Amendment effectiveness.
Repeal clause.
Some protesters have argued that because the Sixteenth Amendment does not contain the words "repeal" or "repealed", the Amendment is ineffective to change the law. According to legal commentator Daniel B. Evans:
In "Buchbinder v. Commissioner", the taxpayers cited the case of "Eisner v. Macomber" and argued that "the Sixteenth Amendment must be interpreted so as not to 'repeal or modify' the original Articles of the Constitution." The United States Tax Court rejected that and all other arguments by Bruce and Elaine Buchbinder (the taxpayer-petitioners), stating: "We will not dress petitioners' frivolous tax-protester ramblings with a cloak of respectability... We find that petitioners in this case have pursued a frivolous cause of action. We find that they are liable for a penalty in the amount of $250.00 under the provisions of Revenue Code section 6673." The actual statement by the United States Supreme Court in "Eisner v. Macomber" is that the Sixteenth Amendment "shall not be extended by loose construction, so as to repeal or modify, "except as applied to income", those provisions of the Constitution that require an apportionment according to population for direct taxes upon property, real and personal ... In order, therefore, that the clauses cited from Article I of the Constitution may have proper force and effect, "save only as modified by the Amendment" ... it becomes essential to distinguish between what is and what is not 'income'..."
"Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.".
In "Parker v. Commissioner", tax protester Alton M. Parker, Sr., challenged the levying of tax upon individual income, based on language in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in "Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.", to the effect that the Sixteenth Amendment "conferred no new power of taxation, but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged [. . . .]" The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected Parker's argument, and stated that Parker's proposition is "only partially correct, and in its critical aspect, is incorrect. The Court of Appeals re-affirmed that the Congress has the power to impose the income tax, and stated that the Sixteenth Amendment "merely eliminates the requirement that the direct income tax be apportioned among the states." The court ruled that Parker had raised a "frivolous" appeal.
Tax protesters argue that in light of this language, the income tax is unconstitutional in that it is a direct tax and that the tax should be apportioned (divided equally amongst the population of the various states).
The above quoted language in "Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co." is not a holding of law in the case. (Compare Ratio decidendi, Precedent, Stare decisis and Obiter dictum for a fuller explanation.)
The quoted language regarding the "complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning" is a reference to the power granted to Congress by the original text of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The reference to "being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it income tax belonged" is a reference to the effect of the 1895 Court decision in "Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.", where taxes on income from property (such as interest income and dividend income) — which, like taxes on income from labor, had always been considered indirect taxes (and therefore not subject to the apportionment rule) — were, beginning in 1895, treated as direct taxes. The Sixteenth Amendment overruled the effect of "Pollock", making the source of the income irrelevant with respect to the apportionment rule, and thereby placing taxes on income from property back into the category of indirect taxes such as income from labor (the Sixteenth Amendment expressly stating that Congress has power to impose income taxes regardless of the source of the income, without apportionment among the states, and without regard to any census or enumeration).
The Court noted that the case "was commenced by the appellant R. Stanton as a stockholder of the Baltic Mining Company, the appellee, to enjoin prevent the voluntary payment by the corporation and its officers of the tax assessed against it under the income tax section of the tariff act of October 3, 1913." On a direct appeal from the trial court, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, which had dismissed Stanton's motion (i.e., had rejected Stanton's request) for a court order to prevent Baltic Mining Company from paying the income tax.
Stanton argued that the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied "to mining companies and their stockholders equal protection of the laws and deprive them of their property without due process of law." The Court rejected that argument. Stanton also argued that the Sixteenth Amendment "authorizes only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform" and that therefore the income tax was "not within the authority of that Amendment." The Court also rejected this argument. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Act, contradicts those tax protesters arguments that the income tax is unconstitutional under either the Fifth Amendment or the Sixteenth Amendment.
Summary.
Tax lawyer Alan O. Dixler has written:
In "Abrams v. Commissioner", the United States Tax Court stated: "Since the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, it is immaterial with respect to income taxes, whether the tax is a direct or indirect tax. The whole purpose of the Sixteenth Amendment was to relieve all income taxes when imposed from requirement of apportionment and from requirement of a consideration of the source whence the income was derived."

DeLeon is an indie rock band from New York that plays Sephardic folk songs in a modern context. The band is named for 12th century Kabalistic philosopher Moses DeLeon and the great-grandfather of front man Daniel Saks, Giorgio DeLeon.
DeLeon was formed in 2006, and first played live in April 2007 at the Bowery Ballroom, alongside Balkan Beat Box. DeLeon has toured with Os Mutantes, Gogol Bordello, Ozomatli, Mike Gordon and Balkan Beat Box. Saks is also a member of The LeeVees and The Macaroons. DeLeon's self-titled album was released August 12, 2008 on JDub Records. Saks (vocals, guitar, banjo), along with band mates Kevin Snider (bass), Justin Riddle (drums), Amy Crawford (keyboard, melodica, glockenspiel) and Andrew Oom (trumpet, synth), wrote the songs that combine ancient Sephardic melodies sung in Ladino, Hebrew and English with modern rock, using guitars, horns and drums.
In 2012, Saks moved to Mexico City, where he recorded DeLeon's third LP, Tremor Fantasma. They released album independently because their former label JDub Records had dissolved. A second version of the band was assembled in Mexico City consisting of Dan Saks and as Mexico City natives Marina de Ita and Cynthia Martinez of Polka Madre, Rodrigo Barbosa of Paté de Fuá and Los Dorados, Fausto Palma of Petra and Strictly Personal and Dante Pimentel .

Anton Podbevšek

Anton Podbevšek (13 June 1898 – 14 November 1981) was a Slovenian avant-garde poet. He was an important influence to the poet Srečko Kosovel. He was one of the participants of the artistic activity known as the Novo Mesto Spring ("Novomeška pomlad") in 1920, which marked the beginning of Slovenian modernism. The poet Miran Jarc portrayed him in the semi-autobiographical novel "Novo mesto" in the character of Andrej Vrezec.
Biography.
Podbevšek was born at Grm manor near the Lower Carniolan village of Kandija, today part of the town of Novo Mesto. The region was then part of the Duchy of Carniola in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is now in Slovenia. The manor was owned by a noble family of Czech origin who had donated it to the Carniolan Agricultural Association, which ran an agricultural school in the building. Anton Podbevšek's father, who originally came from Upper Carniola, worked in the school as a janitor, and the family lived in the manor until 1911.
Between 1909 and 1917, Podbevšek attended the Novo Mesto Grammar School, where he was a schoolmate of the poet Miran Jarc and the gymnast Leon Štukelj. During his school years, he also established a friendship with the painter Božidar Jakac, author Fran Albreht, and composer Marij Kogoj, who lived and studied in Novo Mesto. Podbevšek started writing poetry in high school: he was initially influenced by the aesthetic modernism of Oton Župančič, but soon fell under the influence of avant-garde movements, especially Italian ones. He first attempted to enter literature with the poem cycle "Žolta pisma" (Yellow Letters), which he wrote at age 16. This work shows that he was initially influenced by Italian Futurism.
In 1917, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and sent to the Italian front. He was wounded and spent the last months of the war in a military hospital in Tolmezzo in Friuli. Upon his return, he re-established the contact with his artist friends from Novo Mesto with the intention to establish an avant-garde artistic community, based on the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk: a total work of art that would incorporate literature, music and visual arts. 
In 1920, he helped organize a modernist artistic event known as the Novo Mesto Spring ("Novomeška pomlad"), together with the composer Marij Kogoj, poet Miran Jarc, and painter Božidar Jakac. He went on to become a founder of the journal "Trije labodje" (Three Swans), but later broke with its co-editor Josip Vidmar: Podbevšek wanted a more revolutionary and socialist orientation of the journal, while Vidmar rejected political activism and avant-garde orientations in the name of the classicist notion of "pure art." This led Podbevšek to leave the "Trije labodje" circle and to create "Rdeči pilot" (The Red Pilot), which only lasted for two issues. In the journal, he also published the essay "Political Art" ("Politična umetnost") was one of the first avant-garde manifestos in Slovene. In 1925, he published his only collection of poems, "Človek z bombami" ("Man with Bombs").
After the 1920s, he became less active, but in 1939 he made notable translations of Walt Whitman to celebrate the poet's 120th birthday. In the mid-1960s, he become active again, influenced by the emergence of new Slovene avant-gardism (especially the OHO group, and the poetry of Tomaž Šalamun). However, his intention of republishing the "Man with Bombs" was never realized.
Work.
Anton Podbevšek was the beginner and main representative of the first, radical phase of the Slovenian historical avant-gardes. He deviated from the established poetic forms: in his poems, he used free verse, a nominal or telegraphic style and unusual imagery. He gradually moved from relatively simple poems to longer, graphical hymns in lyrical prose. The themes of his poetry were existential experiences, war, as well as romantic themes.
His poems are characterized by the so-called titanic lyric subject, resulting from the neo-romantic lyrical subject, with the features of Nietzschean "superman" and Whitman's pantheism. In addition, many poems reveal a strong expressionist influence. Podbevšek's initial enthusiasm for futurism was later attenuated: what remained from the futurist influences was the celebration of art and some stylistical elements, but even those can actually be attributed to the emerging expressionism. Differently from the futurists, Podbevšek had a highly ambivalent attitude to the war.
Legacy.
Podbevšek's work was highly influential for the Slovene constructivists, who mostly came from the Slovenian Littoral (including Trieste and Gorizia): particularly the poet Srečko Kosovel, but also the painters Avgust Černigoj and Ivan Čargo, and theater director Ferdo Delak, who later consciously distanced themselves from Podbevšek. 
In the 1960s, the Slovenian neo-avant-garde re-discovered Podbevšek's work, although few of them were directly influenced by him.
In 2006 the Anton Podbevšek Theater was founded in Novo Mesto and named after him.

Rhinosporidiosis

Rhinosporidiosis is an infection caused by "Rhinosporidium seeberi".
Classification.
This organism was previously considered to be a fungus, and rhinosporidiosis is classified as a fungal disease under ICD-10. 
It is now considered to be a parasite, classified under Mesomycetozoea.
Authors of detailed studies have revealed superficial similarities between "Dermocystidium" and "Rhinosporidium" when using light microscopy, but substantial morphological differences between the groups exist.
There is some evidence that DNA extracted from purified uncontaminated round bodies (Rhinosporidium seeberi) is of cyanobacterium origin.
Pathophysiology.
Rhinosporidiosis is a granulomatous disease affecting the mucous membrane of nasopharynx, oropharynx, conjunctiva, rectum and external genitalia. Though the floor of the nose and inferior turbinate are the most common sites, the lesions may appear in elsewhere too. Traumatic inoculation from one site to others is common. Laryngeal rhinosporidiosis, too, has been described and may be due to inoculation from the nose during endotracheal intubation. After inoculation, the organism replicates locally, resulting in hyperplasia of host tissue and localised immune response.
Epidemiology.
Disease endemic in Chhattisgarh South India, Sri Lanka, South America and Africa. It is presumed to be transmitted by exposure to the pathogen when taking a bath in stagnant water pools where animals also bath.

Nora and Nori

Nora and Nori otherwise known as the twins are fictional characters in the Nickelodeon Latin America original series, Skimo. They are the major antagonists in the show. Nora and Nori are portrayed by real life twin actresses Alejandra and Avelina Vázquez Haro.
Personality.
Nora and Nori are superficial, competitive, envious 16-year old twin girls. They are always trying to lead Skimo to bankruptcy.
People often confuse one for the other. They like to dress girly and coquettish and they have big dreams. The twins believe they are supermodels even though they only once modeled shoes, and they say that they have famous friends and acquaintances because they appeared in a TV show, although they were only extras.
It's obvious they're the typical villains in the show. By any means they try to extract information and secrets from partners of the restaurant so they can use it to boycott Skimo and incidentally cause troubles for Fito and Tavo, even though they are really happy being part of Skimo.
At the end of the series the twins decided to go their separate ways, with Nori wanting to specialize in medicine and Nora wanting to go to acting school.
Relations.
Fito and Tavo think that Nora and Nori are very annoying, jealous and superficial, but the twins do not know this because they think that Tavo and Fito like them. Fito never liked the twins mostly because they always insulted him. The twins primarily don't liked anyone in Skimo and no one really liked them, but the twins definitely hated Ursula, who they have been arch-enemies with since the starting of the show. Ursula was easily annoyed by the twins' attitude and usually banged their heads together whenever they bothered her.

Ami'ad

Ami'ad () is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located near Safed, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. In 2011 it had a population of 432.
History.
The founders were a gar'in of 28 young people who were originally from the Youth Aliyah village of Ben Shemen (rescued from Europe before the borders were closed) and a group of youngsters from Kibbutz Hulda. 
The original plan was to prepare the outpost as a future settlement for demobilized soldiers from the Jewish Brigade of the British Army but instead they decided to settle the outpost themselves.
The group were graduates of the Hanoar Haoved Movement and the first to form a unit in the Palmach.
They initially settled on a hill around two kilometres south of modern Ami'ad, naming their settlement Jubb Yosef after the nearby ruins. They later moved to the current site, renaming the kibbutz HaHoshlim, before adopting the current name.
Economy.
In addition to agriculture (avocado, banana and olive plantations; poultry and cattle), kibbutz Ami'ad has a successful factory that manufactures water filtration solutions. The company, Amiad Water Systems Ltd. (previously Amiad Filtration Systems Ltd.) is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has operations in Europe, the United States, Brazil, India, China and Australia.

Malu cu Flori is a community in Dâmboviţa County, southern Romania with a population of 2,675 people, containing five villages: Capu Coastei, Copăceni, Malu cu Flori(Lunca), Micloşanii Mari and Micloşanii Mici.
The name Malu cu Flori is historical. Malu cu Flori is located in the Subcarpathian Mountains close to the peak Leaota, connecting the plains with the mountains. Since long time ago when people traveled from place to place to trade their products, they came from the plain areas with grains to change them for metal. On this hill, the travelers made a stop to relax, and named the place Malu cu Flori from the lilac bushes that used to grow everywhere on this area. Looking from the mountain, Malu cu Flori creates the impression of a quiet green depression surrounded by very high hills and forests, and cut it by the Dambovita river, and by the national route Targoviste-Campulung. Even though the Dambovita river looks small, from time to time during decades is floating, putting in danger the population from Lunca, and Capul Coastei areas. Another problem is land sliding of the high area such as Miclosani.

Sparks–Shock brawl

The Sparks–Shock brawl (also known as The Malice at the Palace II) was an altercation that occurred in a Women's National Basketball Association game between the Detroit Shock and Los Angeles Sparks on July 21, 2008 at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "It was," wrote Ray Ratto in the "Wall Street Journal", "in the classic sense, one of those things that occasionally happens when highly competitive people want the same thing and one can’t have it."
Altercation.
With 4.5 seconds before the game was officially over, the fighting began on the court after a free throw attempt when Plenette Pierson made a hard block out on Candace Parker; the two players became entangled and fell. As Parker was down, Pierson stormed over to Parker and aggressively walked over the top of her; in response, Parker pulled Pierson to the court. Parker threw a punch at Pierson before being tackled by Deanna Nolan as players and coaches from both teams joined in. Detroit Assistant Coach Rick Mahorn came off the bench as a peacemaker, but the 6-10, 300-plus pounder incited more violence when he inadvertently knocked Los Angeles forward Lisa Leslie to the floor after Leslie threw a punch. Leslie's teammate, DeLisha Milton-Jones, punched a stunned Mahorn in the shoulder. Sparks players Murriel Page and Shannon Bobbitt also hit Mahorn. Pierson, Parker, Milton-Jones, and Mahorn were all ejected from the game. The altercation also resulted in a season-ending ACL injury to Shock player Cheryl Ford, who was trying to restrain her teammate.
This was the second major basketball fight to occur at The Palace in four years, the other being the Pacers–Pistons brawl in 2004.
Suspensions.
According to WNBA rules:
Because they were ejected after the altercation, Parker, Milton-Jones, Mahorn, and Pierson all started serving their suspensions the immediate next game. Also according to WNBA rules, each team must have at least eight active members to play a game. Therefore, suspensions were staggered by alphabetical order of last name. To have eight on the Sparks' roster, Page was allowed to play in the immediate next game and served her suspension starting with the second game after the altercation. Because she was not active, Powell served her suspension when she was taken off the inactive list.

U.S. Open of Surfing

The U.S. Open of Surfing is a week-long surfing competition held annually during the summer in Huntington Beach, California. Generally held on the south side of the Huntington Beach Pier, the U.S. Open is part of the qualification process for the ASP World Tour and is an ASP Prime event. It is the largest surfing competition in the world. It has been owned by IMG since 2000.
As part of the event, notable people in the world of surfing are added to the Surfing Walk of Fame and to the Surfers' Hall of Fame, both directly across from the pier. 
History.
The U.S. Open, then called the West Coast Surfing Championship, was first held in 1959. In 1964 it became known as the United States Surfing Championships. In 1982 it became known as the OP Pro for its sponsor, Ocean Pacific. The event was re-named the U.S. Open of Surfing in 1994.
The contest was traditionally held during Labor Day weekend. The event was changed to an earlier date following the 1986 event when riots occurred at the OP Pro. 
Rioting again marred the 2013 U.S. Open. On the final day of the event, as the crowds left the contest area and filled Main Street, a civil disturbance erupted, resulting in property damage and several arrests and some injuries. As a result, the event owner IMG stated that in 2014 it will discontinue events such as free concerts and focus more on the sport. 
Spending at the nine-day event adds $21.5 million to the Orange County economy and $16.4 million in Huntington Beach. It is attended by nearly 500,000 people.

Books of secrets

Books of secrets were compilations of technical and medicinal recipes and magic formulae that began to be printed in the sixteenth century and were published continuously down to the eighteenth century. They constituted one of the most popular genres in early modern scientific publishing. The books of secrets contained hundreds of medical recipes, household hints, and technical recipes on metallurgy, alchemy, dyeing, making perfume, oil, incense, and cosmetics. The books of secrets supplied a great deal of practical information to an emerging new, middle-class readership, leading some historians to link them with the emerging secularistic values of the early modern period and to see them as contributing to the making of an ‘age of how-to.’
Some books of secrets, such as Alessio Piemontese's famous "Secreti" (1555), contained mainly practical and technological information in the form of useful recipes. Others, such as Giambattista Della Porta's "Magia naturalis" ("Natural Magic", 1558) deployed practical recipes in an effort to demonstrate the principles of natural magic. Other books of secrets, such as Isabella Cortese's "Secreti" (1564), disseminated alchemical information to a wide readership. Recent research has suggested that the books of secrets may have played an important role in the emergence of experimental science by bringing practical technical information to the attention of experimental scientists.

Amir, Israel

Amir (, "lit." Sheaf) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located in the Finger of the Galilee near Kiryat Shmona, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. In 2011 it had a population of 536. The kibbutz is on the eastern bank of the Jordan River in the Hula Valley, and has views of snow-topped Mount Hermon to the northeast, and the Ramat Naftali to the west.
The village was established on 29 October 1939 on land, purchased by the Jewish National Fund from the Arab village of Khiyam al-Walid. It was the last of the tower and stockade settlements, and the only one to be established during World War II. Its founders were immigrants from Lithuania and Poland, later joined by German and Yugoslav settlers. Initially they suffered from outbreaks of malaria, but managed to establish an intensively cultivated farm. According to a 1949 report from the Jewish National Fund, a clinic was opened at Amir for the treatment of malaria and eye diseases by a professor from Hebrew University. Until the beginning of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war treatment there for neighboring Arab villagers was free. 
A photo in the June 1940 edition of Life Magazine shows a kibbutz member plowing the heavy soil with a primitive plow pulled by two water buffalo. Due to its location, the kibbutz was affected by floods every winter, and in 1942 was moved to its present location on land bought from another Arab village, al-Dawwara.
Several important women artists are associated with Kibbutz Amir. Israeli jewelry artist Deganit Stern Schocken was born at Kibbutz Amir in 1947; she now teaches and works in Hadera. Israeli ceramicist, designer and filmmaker Shlomit Bauman was born at Kibbutz Amir in 1962; she now lives and works in Jaffa. American photographer Annie Leibovitz worked as a volunteer at Kibbutz Amir in 1969, and gelatin silver prints of her photos taken during her stay are now part of the collection of the Jewish Museum in New York.
A disposable diaper factory, originally owned by the kibbutz, was privatized in 2003. On July 15, 2006 a missile fired from Lebanon hit Kibbutz Amir, destroying the factory. The missile struck on Saturday, so no one was in the factory at the time and no lives were lost. The factory was located about 400 meters from the residential part of the kibbutz. Four days later, another missile hit a cow shed, killing two dozen dairy cows; again no people were killed or injured despite the proximity of the explosion to the residential part of the kibbutz.

Hamster ball

Hamster balls are hollow spheres made of clear plastic into which hamsters, gerbils, degus and other small rodent pets are placed, allowing them to run around outside their cages without the risk of running away, getting lost under furniture or in walls. The balls also produce an audible rumble across many surfaces, making the hamster easier to find.
Most hamster balls are made of durable, transparent plastic with air holes and a small door or lid to allow the owner to insert or remove the hamster from the ball. Hamster balls are supposed to provide exercise for hamsters.
Although hamster balls are designed to protect hamsters, there are hazards such as stairs and other high places from which hamsters can fall, resulting in injury or even death. So in order to protect the hamsters, the owners place hamster balls on the lower level of their house, away from any stairs. Some also create a simple barrier near the stairs, so that they will not roll down the stairs.
Although hamster balls have air holes, hamsters should be allowed to take breaks and leave the ball regularly due to a lack of water that could potentially induce heatstroke or exhaustion.
Hamster and other small pet owners should also be advised that it is important to keep watch over the hamster ball at all times while the pet is inside. Some hamster owners have noted that at times the ball can pick up too much speed, causing the hamster to somersault inside and potentially be injured.
Hamster balls are recommended by the manufacturers for use with hamsters, gerbils, mice, degus and small rats only; they should not be used for rabbits, chinchillas or guinea pigs, as their size and body structures are different from small rodents, posing a serious hazard to them if placed inside.

Alexander McDougall (ship)

SS "Alexander McDougall" was a "whaleback" ship, the last and longest whaleback ever built. The design, created by Scottish captain Alexander McDougall (1845-1923), enabled her to carry a maximum amount of cargo with a minimum of draft. Whalebacks were also called "pig boats", among other names, due to their appearance. The "Alexander McDougall" was the only whaleback built a with traditionally shaped bow. This was done in an attempt to increase the strength of the ship's hull so that the beam could be increased. "Alexander McDougall" was also the only whaleback to be outfitted with a quadruple expansion engine.

Alaska gubernatorial election, 1994

The 1994 Alaska gubernatorial election took place on November 8, 1994 for the post of Governor of Alaska, United States. Democratic candidate Tony Knowles narrowly defeated Republican candidate Jim Campbell and Lieutenant Governor Jack Coghill of the Alaskan Independence Party. In the Republican Revolution year of the 1994 elections, Alaska's was the only governor's seat in the country to switch from Republican to Democratic.
Candidates.
Incumbent Governor Walter Joseph Hickel had been elected as the candidate of the Alaskan Independence Party in the 1990 gubernatorial election. In April 1994 he rejoined the Republican Party and announced in August that he would not stand for re-election.
In the Democratic primary, the Democratic candidate from 1990 and former mayor of Anchorage, Tony Knowles, won with 43% of the vote. He defeated former Lieutenant Governor Stephen McAlpine with 31% and former Speaker of the Alaskan House of Representatives Sam Cotten with 25%.
For the Republican nomination, businessman Jim Campbell narrowly defeated another former mayor of Anchorage, Tom Fink. Lieutenant Governor Jack Coghill was easily selected as the candidate for the Alaskan Independence Party while Jim Sykes ran for the Green Party of Alaska.
Campaign.
Both main candidates in the election were regarded as moderates and favored oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as well as cuts in the state budget. Polls near the election showed Knowles with a strong lead over Campbell.
During the election the Campbell campaign ran an advertisement comparing Knowle's hair with President Bill Clinton's. The advert was criticised by supporters of Knowles who felt it implied that he was a womanizer.
Recount.
As the results were counted state officials said that the contest between Knowles and Campbell was too close to call, with Knowles having a small lead. Knowles declared victory on the November 18 after the official count showed that he was ahead of 528 votes with only 217 votes remaining to be counted. He described the victory as the "largest margin I think I've ever won by" as his Anchorage mayoralty election wins had always been by very narrow margins.
Campbell contested the results and called for a recount, which was paid for by the state as the candidates were within half a percent of each other. Campbell also wanted to look into some voter incentives that had taken place including raffles and free gasoline for voters. These were defended as attempts to increase turnout and had been authorised by election officials. 
The initial count showed Knowles with 87,701 votes and Campbell with 87,118 votes. The results of the recount slightly narrowed the gap between them with Knowles ending on 87,693 and Campbell on 87,157. Knowles's victory margin was the smallest in any Alaska gubernatorial election.

DRG Class 80

The Class 80 tank engines were German standard locomotives ("Einheitsloks") with the Deutsche Reichsbahn. They were intended to replace the aging, rickety state railway line engines performing shunting duties in their dotage at large stations.
History.
Between 1927 and 1928 39 vehicles were produced, having been built in the locomotive factories of Jung in Jungenthal, Union Gießerei in Königsberg, Wolf and Hohenzollern. With the development of the Class 80, a relatively economical and simple locomotive class, it was hoped that the cost of shunting duties would come down.
After they had been on duty, prior to the Second World War, primarily in the area of Leipzig (including the shunting of post vans) and Cologne, 22 units went into the DR in East Germany, post-1945, and 17 to the Deutsche Bundesbahn. They were in service with the DR until 1968.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the last Bundesbahn engine was taken out of service in 1965. Several examples survived in the Ruhrgebiet until 1977 as industrial locomotives with the Ruhrkohle AG.
Preserved Locomotives.
A total of seven locomotives of this class have been preserved:

The character "Puffa" from TUGS is a Marklin Gauge-1 DRG Class 80 - fitted with a cowcatcher - to resemble an American locomotive. Another Marklin Class 80 was used in the first season of Thomas the Tank Engine; its purpose was to haul background rolling stock. This engine has been dubbed by some fans as "The Marklin Engine."

Range Lights.
In 1878, the U.S. Congress authorized range lights on Parris Island. These were to be used with the Hilton Head Range Lights to guide ships coming into Port Royal Sound. 
The Front Range Light was a tall, wooden tower with square cross section and four legs. The watch room beneath the lantern was enclosed. To compensate for any shifts in the channel, the front light could be moved.
The front light suffered from erosion and storm damage. Its foundation was replaced in 1892. In 1900 and 1902 the U.S. Lighthouse Board's Annual Report indicated that it would have to be moved back. It is possible that the front light was moved back prior to deactivation. 
The Rear Light was a tall triangular, iron skeletal tower, manufactured by the Cooper Manufacturing of Mount Vernon, Ohio. John Michael Doyle, who was an employee of the manufacturer, supervised the erection of the tower on a concrete foundation. Doyle later supervised the erection of the shorter Bloody Point Rear Range Light. He also became the first light keeper at Bloody Point. A brick lamp house, which was also called a lens house, was built at the base of the tower to house the lamp during the day. At night, the locomotive or steamer lamp with parabolic reflector was raised on rails to a height of . The Parris Island Range Lights were lit in 1881.
A wooden walkway was built to connect the lights. The keeper's house was built about midway between the front and rear light.

Stencil (numerical analysis)

In mathematics, especially the areas of numerical analysis concentrating on the numerical solution of partial differential equations, a stencil is a geometric arrangement of a nodal group that relate to the point of interest by using a numerical approximation routine. Stencils are the basis for many algorithms to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDE). Two examples of stencils are the five-point stencil and the Crank–Nicolson method stencil.
Stencils are classified into two categories: compact and non-compact, the difference being the layers from the point of interest that are also used for calculation.
In the notation used for one-dimensional stencils n-1, n, n+1 indicate the time steps where timestep n and n-1 have known solutions and time step n+1 is to be calculated. The spacial location of finite volumes used in the calculation are indicated by j-1, j and j+1.

Literary Mama

Literary Mama (LiteraryMama.com) is a U.S.-based online literary magazine focused on publishing writing about motherhood in a variety of genres. The writings found in "Literary Mama" challenge all types of media to rethink its narrow focus of what mothers think and do. Updated weekly, the departments include columns, creative nonfiction, fiction, Literary Reflections, poetry, Profiles and Reviews, OpEd, and a blog. "Literary Mama" reaches 40,000 readers monthly.
History.
Inspired by the variety of mothers and mothering, co-founder Amy Hudock sought out and gathered women in Berkeley, California interested in reading and writing about motherhood. This group challenged the conventional two-way street of motherhood commonly found in mainstream media: either "sickly sweet" or utterly negative. "We weren't able to get our work published because the glossy parenting magazines only wanted articles that showed only a small part of motherhood and we wanted a place where we could publish our work and find work we wanted to read," says Ms. Hudock. With the collaboration of co-founder Andrea J. Buchanan, "Literary Mama: A Literary Magazine for the Maternally Inclined" was born.
The Online Magazine Today.
The mission statement communicates intent clearly: "We are a home for beautiful poetry, fiction and creative non-fiction that may be too long, too complex, too ambiguous, too deep, too raw, too irreverent, too ironic, and too body conscious for other publications." A weekly ezine is sent highlighting new works specific to department, column, and the blog. True to the mission of "Literary Mama", the magazine encourages Mama and non-Mama writers alike to submit work for review and for possible publication. The Literary Reflections department posts a monthly writing prompt, and classes are offered to help writers reach their goals. 
"Literary Mama" was named by "Writer's Digest" as one of the "101 Best Websites for Writers" and by "Forbes" for "Best of the Web".
An anthology of selected pieces from 2003 to 2005 was published in December 2005 by Seal Press, ISBN 1-58005-158-8.

John Doane

John Doane John Doane (c.1590 - 1685/6) He arrived in Plymouth Colony on an unknown ship sometime between 1628 and 1632. During his long life he is considered a person of note in Plymouth Colony serving in many government capacities associated with the colony government, such as government committees and deputy for Plymouth as well as Assistant Governor in 1632/33. He left government service for a time in the 1630s to serve as deacon in the Plymouth Church.
English Origins.
John Doane stated he was born in England and in his 1678 will he stated he was age about eighty-eight years of age making his birth year being about 1590. Nothing else is known of his English ancestry. There is no record of John Doane being in Leiden, Holland, although he was a Plymouth church deacon.
In Plymouth Colony.
In 1632/33 he was Assistant Governor.
Records show that on January 2, 1632/33 Governor Bradford, Captain Standish, John Alden, John Howland, Stephen Hopkins, Samuel Fuller, Sr., and John Doane and other notables were ordered by the court to assess taxes on the colonists payable in grain or the equivalent.
1633 was the first year that the records show all seven governmental Assistants. Edward Winslow as governor and the Assistants were William Bradford, Myles Standish, John Howland, John Alden, John Doane, Stephen Hopkins and William Gilson.
On April 8, 1633 John Doane sold the indenture of Walter Harris - who had bound himself to serve Mr. Atwood of London under command of Mr. John Doane of New Plymouth - to Henry Howland. 
On January 2, 1633/34 tax rates were again assessed by the new governor, Thomas Prence, and William Bradford, Captain Standish, John Howland, Stephen Hopkins, John Doane and others associated with colony government. Eighty individuals to be taxed were listed. 
Nathaniel Morton wrote that John Cooke, Mr. John Doane and Mr. William Paddy were deacons under Reverend John Reyner, and John Dunham became a deacon later. John Doane was at least a deacon as early as January 2, 1633/34 when he resigned his office as Assistant (governor) because of his deaconship.
On January 1633/34 he was "freed from office" so that he could devote his full-time to church functions. 
Per records of the time, Martha Harding died before October 28, 1633 with John Doane presenting her inventory and also was administrator on behalf of her son. She died without a will, leaving one son in the custody of Mr. John Doane and it has been thought she may have Doane's sister. 
As early as January 5, 1635/36, John Doane, John Winslow, his brother Kenelm Winslow and others were chosen to assist the governor and council to set rates on goods to be sold and wages to be paid to laborers. The court not only regulated prices, but sometimes quality. 
In 1636 Eleanor Billington was fined and sentenced to sit in the stocks and be whipped for slandering John Doane. The Billingtons were Mayflower passengers and had been a troublesome family in the colony since 1620, with her husband John Billington being hanged for murder in 1630. 
In October 1636 the General Court appointed William Brewster, John Doane and others as a special committee to join with the governor and Assistants in reviewing all laws and to make commendations for changes at the next court meeting. This committee was one of various committees upon which John Doane served. 
On December 30, 1636, John Atwood, late of London, bought John Doane's half-interest in a house and land near Plain Dealing that they had jointly owned.
Per the records of the time, John Doane had a business connection with Mr. John Atwood, who was an Assistant in 1638.
John Doane, who became a deacon in the Plymouth Church, was probably a Separatist, for church membership and Separatism went hand in hand. 
In the 1640s (undated) records list freemen residing in the area of Nauset on Cape Cod planning to establish a town separate from the control of Plymouth. These freemen included Governor Thomas Prence, Edward Bangs and John Doane, among other notables. John Doane was one of the men appointed to buy land at Nauset from the Indians and later became one of the first settlers there. On March 3, 1644/45 the General Court granted to the Plymouth Church "or those that goe to dwell at Nosett," all the land between sea and sea "from the Purchasors bounds at Naumskeckett to the Hering Brooke at Billingsgate." The court on June 2, 1646 ordered that "Nawsett" be made a township and Samuel Hicks was appointed as constable. (Samuel Hicks was married to John Doane's daughter Lydia.) On June 7, 1651 the court ordered the name of the town of Nauset to be changed to Eastham. 
John Doane was very active in colonial government, serving on numerous committees and as a deputy to the Court for Eastham.
Doane was usually given the honoric title of "Mr.", a mark of the gentry, and in one document he referred to himself as "Gent., Tayler". 
In other documents John Doane commonly identified himself as "husbandman" or "Yeoman", but in a 1681 deed of land to his daughter Abigail, he listed himself as a "tailor".
Family.
John Doane's earliest known wife was called Ann in a 1648 deed, but in a later deed (of 1659) his wife was Lydia. 
Children of John and (probably) Ann Doane: 
The will of John Doane.
In his will dated May 18, 1678, inventory taken May 21, 1686 and sworn by Abigail Doane May 29, 1686, he named his "loving wife," daughter Abigail, sons John, Daniel and Ephraim, and granddaughter Margaret Hicks, and left the remainder of his estate to "all my sons and daughters". He described himself in the will as "aged eighty and eight or there about" and in the inventory he was said to have died February 21, 1685/86, "aged about a hundred years" - a typical overstatement of age which occurred in those times.
Death and burial of John Doane.
John Doane died in Eastham, Massachusetts on February 21, 1685/6. He was buried in Cove Burying Ground in Eastham where his tombstone is existent as well as memorials in his honor.
Memorial.
In 1869 the Doanes erected a memorial stone on the site of Deacon John's house in Eastham, Massachusetts. That site, overlooking Nauset Bay, is now a part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. In 1906, a perpetual lot in the Old Town Cove burial ground, including the grave site of Deacon Daniel Doane, a son, was set aside. The following year a memorial stone with a bronze tablet honoring Deacon John Doane was erected. In 1994 a granite stone and bronze marker commemorating the 350th anniversary of the founding of Nauset was dedicated at the homesite.

The Allmusic review by Adam Greenberg awarded the album 3½ stars stating "This is basic New Orleans funky, bluesy rock & roll... There's probably not anything new here stylistically, but that's really the key. The music is simultaneously fresh and nostalgic, conserved but energetic. It's not an adventurous sound the band is after here, but it's a terrific album full of fundamentals with quality performances all around.".

Hopewell Mills District

Hopewell Mills District is a historic district on Bay Street and Albro Avenue in Taunton, Massachusetts. The site is associated with the Hopewell Mills, one of the earliest textile mills in the city, established in 1818 (mill now demolished).
The historic district contains a number of early 19th century brick mill worker tenement homes and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
History.
The village was established in 1818 by a group of industrialists led by Charles Richmond, in association with Samuel Crocker and Silas Shepard. The site previously contained a nail-cutting mill owned by Samuel Leonard, built in the 1780s. Crocker and Richmond first built a cotton mill, one hundred feet in length. The basement included a machine shop and nail factory. A second cotton mill was added in 1821. In 1823, the mills were merged into the stock of the Taunton Manufacturing Company, which operated the mills until 1843.
After the bankruptcy of Taunton Manufacturing Company, the mills were acquired by Cyrus Lothrop who controlled the site until his accidental death in 1854. The property then passed to Charles Albro, who had been superintendent of the mills. Much of the village that exists today dates from the period of Albro's ownership (1854-1888). In 1888, Albro sold the mill to the investment firm of L. Beebe & Co. of Boston, who operated it until 1904, when the mill was destroyed by fire. The ruins remained in place for many years.

Works.
He wrote two books: "Alcune ragioni del P. Pio Melia della C. di G." (Lucca, 1847), a defence of the Society of Jesus, and "Alcune affirmazioni del Sig.

Melia, who attacked especially Rosmini's doctrine on original sin, was answered by Rosmini (Milan, 1841) and Pagani (Milan, 1842); then began a bitter controversy which had to be ended by a direct command of Pope Pius IX.

A Patriot's History of the United States

"A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror" is a 2004 book on American history by Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen. Written from a conservative standpoint, it is a counterpoint to Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" and asserts that the United States is an "overwhelmingly positive" force for good in the world. 
Reception.
After being recommended by talk-show host Glenn Beck, the book quickly rose to the top of the "New York Times" and Amazon.com bestseller lists.
In a review of the Schweikart/Allen book in the conservative magazine "National Review", Matthew Spalding of the Heritage Foundation wrote that ""A Patriot's History" rejects the economic determinism of Beard and Zinn, and others who 'wrongly assume that people were (and are) incapable of acting outside of self-interest.'" Spalding continued: 
Reviewing the book in the journal "The History Teacher", David Hoogland Noon was strongly critical of it. According to Noon, the book's peculiar priorities – it "devotes a single paragraph to the Japanese internment while squandering an entire page with denunciations of liberal historians and "their" treatments of the subject" – as well as the omission of landmark works from its sources suggest "ignorance of the basic parameters of actual historical scholarship". Moreover, according to Noon, "the authors make claims that are not even remotely endorsed by the footnoted sources". "Written for an audience of the previously converted," Noon concluded, "this book is hardly worth anyone else's time."
Criticizing the book from a conservative perspective, Paul Gottfried in the "The American Conservative" characterized "A Patriot's History" as an example of neoconservative historiography: 
In his review of the book in the "Wall Street Journal", Brendan Miniter called a "Patriot's History" a "fluent account of America from the discovery of the Continent up to the present day."

Eva (novel)

Eva is a science fiction novel for young adults by Peter Dickinson, published by Gollancz in 1988. Set in a dystopian future, it features "the hybrid that results when the brain-patterns and memory of a dying girl are transferred into the brain of a chimpanzee." Dickinson researched chimp behavior for the book and he dedicated it to Jane Goodall.
"Eva" was highly commended for the annual British Carnegie Medal and in 2008 it won the retrospective Phoenix Award. It is one of Dickinson's best known works and by far his most popular in the U.S. 
Plot introduction.
When 13-year-old Eva is badly injured in an accident, her consciousness is transplanted into the body of a chimpanzee. The novel concerns her efforts to adjust to her unique situation. The setting is a future when urban civilization has spread across the globe, with disastrous effects on other species.
Plot summary.
The novel opens as Eva wakes up in a hospital bed, paralyzed. Her mother assures her she will be fine, that the doctors will gradually reduce the paralysis. Eva guesses that her face has been badly scarred, but when she looks in a mirror, she sees the face of a chimpanzee. An experimental procedure has been used to transplant Eva's "neuron memory" into Kelly, a young chimp from her father's research facility.
Eva learns to adapt to her new body, using a keyboard to simulate her voice. She has dreams of a forest she has never seen - that Kelly has never seen either - and imagines it comes from the chimpanzee unconscious. She realizes that she must accept the chimpanzee part of herself, which is easier for her as she has grown up with her father's chimps. 
The cost of the procedure has been met by a media company in return for broadcast rights. Eva is a big hit with the public and her family has to cope with massive media interest. The power of the 'shaper' companies is immense in a world where many people spend all day at home. 'Shaper' technology is a cross between television and virtual reality. 
Eva spends most of her time with humans, even going to school, but also spends time in the Reserve, where she learns to adapt to the chimpanzee social group. Her human understanding helps her to manipulate some of the situations and she becomes accepted by the others. One particularly intelligent chimp, Sniff, is intrigued by her.
With the introduction of enthusiastic animal rights advocate Grog Kennedy the novel takes another turn. He convinces Eva that for the sake of the species the chimpanzees must return to the wild. Not only do they belong there, but Grog believes the human race is running out of steam and will before long no longer bother to care for animals in captivity. At this stage there are only small pockets of wilderness left, and most species have died out.
Grog and Eva devise an ingenious plan to get the chimps to the island of St. Hilaire near Madagascar where Eva and Sniff lead the others in an escape. Her human knowledge is necessary to help the chimps learn the skills necessary to survive, which means that she must cut herself off from other humans. The novel ends twenty-four years later when Eva is near death, the human race is in decline and Eva imagines a future in which the descendants of her band of chimpanzees become the new dominant race.
Relation to Dickinson's other works.
The novel returns to the ecological themes of the Changes trilogy (1968–70) and "Emma Tupper's Diary" (1970). The former imagines a psychological change in the human race, the latter deals with the survival of a species. In one of his mystery novels, "The Poison Oracle" (1974), a chimpanzee who has learned to communicate becomes a witness in a murder case.
Dickinson wrote "City of Gold and other stories from the Old Testament" (1980) for a series of retellings and classics illustrated by Michael Foreman. His editor then asked him to tackle Arthurian legends for the same series; he was intrigued but found the material on King Arthur to thin to work with. That generated "Merlin Dreams" (1988), which features "Merlin drowsing the centuries away under his rock, waking from time to time and recalling some item from the mythic Celtic past, and then dreaming a story about it." But they are Dickinson's stories, not existing Arthurian stories. Next he decided to "do something with the various First Women that people have imagined at different times — Eve of course, and the shadowy figures of classical myth, and as many of the other cultural traditions I could find and work in." Rather than time-travel, or dreams, his heroine would somehow meet the Eve myth while in a coma — in a future where "the Eve myth dwindled to a cheap TV cartoon."
Dickinson originally conceived Eva as a woman making contact with an early ancestress while in a coma. The book was much changed from the original concept, but the Adam and Eve cartoon which Eva watches is a remnant of it, and Eva herself becomes an ancestress of sorts. Dickinson has since returned to our remote ancestors in "A Bone from a Dry Sea" (1992) and "The Kin" (1998).
Awards.
When it was new, "Eva" was a highly commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the British Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject, and an honor book for the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in the US. In 1992 it won the Senior Division Young Reader's Choice Award from the Pacific Northwest Library Association (US and Canada), which annually recognises one three-year-old book. 
"Eva" won the 2008 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. That is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity. In his acceptance speech Dickinson noted that after years of speaking to and corresponding with readers, primarily Americans, "I was astonished to find ... that it was eligible. I was convinced it must have won something important enough to disqualify it."
Reception.
"Eva" is one of Peter Dickinson's best-known books. The author says: "80% of my mail, almost all of it from the USA, is about this one book. This baffles me." The novel is used in classroom study to stimulate discussion of medical ethics, animal rights and other issues.
Neil Philip in the "Times Literary Supplement" called "Eva" "one of the better books of a first-rate writer. It is highly provocative, it has tenderness, humour and passion. It involves the reader from the very first page and will not quickly leave the mind." Ethel Heins in a "Horn Book" review called it "a work of passion and eloquence, and its sobering significance increases in proportion to the reader's maturity." In an academic journal article ten years later, Kathryn V. Graham placed "Eva" in a tradition of British children's literature that elevates the rural setting above the urban (Exodus from the City).
Betty Carter took a "Second Look" at "Eva" in the September/October 2001 issue of "The Horn Book Magazine". She cites "Eva" as a good illustration of Dickinson's place as a thought-provoking author for young adults. "The topics raised in "Eva" transcend the fleeting concerns of adolescence. Dickinson shows tremendous respect for his readers and their ability to grapple with hard issues that range from euthanasia to the influence of the media." 
Dickinson professes "mixed feelings about his books being studied in schools" and he currently publishes a reply to Professor Carter, with 2001 copyright date, "A Letter in Response to an Article About Teaching Eva". He contrasts with "Professor Carter" and others "the naive reader ... is doing no more than "experiencing" the book by re-imagining my invention, in something like the manner in which I imagined it." For him, he says, "it's enough if the naive one simply takes it aboard as part of his/her subconscious awareness."
Publication history.
Delacorte Press published the first U.S. edition early in 1989. There were paperback editions no later than 1990 in the U.S. (Laurel Leaf, mass-market) and 1991 in the U.K. (Corgi).

Hortonville, Massachusetts

Hortonville is a village in the town of Swansea, Bristol County, Massachusetts, United States. The part of the village on Locust Street from Oak Street to Hortonville Rd. makes up the Hortonville Historic District.
Hortonville was first settled in the 18th century by the Hale, Martin, and Eddy families. These families built homes on farmland they owned in the western end of the village. The eastern end of the village, along the Cole River, became the site of several gristmills, lending the village the name "Swansea Factory." In the 1830s, a school, church, and Universalist hall were built in the village. Nathaniel Horton settled in the area in 1856 and helped the village gain its own post office, which was named Hortonville in his honor. After 1900, industrial development in the area stalled, and the village became a residential and agricultural area.
The district features Greek Revival, Georgian, and Federal architecture houses and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

USS Torchwood (AN-55)

USS "Torchwood" (AN-55/YN-74) was an which served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations during World War II. She performed her net laying services until war’s end, and then was given to the Republic of China.
Launched at Stockton, California.
"Torchwood" (YN-74) was laid down on 22 June 1943 at Stockton, California, by the Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Co., redesignated "AN-55" on 20 January 1944; launched on 19 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry F. Bruns; and commissioned at San Francisco, California, on 12 May 1944.
World War II service.
Pacific Ocean operations.
After fitting-out, "Torchwood" cleared San Francisco on 3 June 1944 and arrived in San Pedro, California, two days later to begin a month of training. On 3 July, she put to sea, bound for Hawaii, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 11th.
After almost a fortnight in the Hawaiian Islands, she got underway on 23 July and shaped a course for the southwestern Pacific Ocean. She made a brief stop at Funafuti in the Ellice Islands on 7 August and, 10 days later, reached Milne Bay, New Guinea, where she reported for duty with the U.S. 7th Fleet.
"Torchwood" served in the anchorage at Milne Bay through mid-September and then moved forward to support the landings in the Netherlands East Indies at Morotai. By early December, she was at Manus in the Admiralty Islands, but she got underway again on the 4th and returned to Milne Bay on the 6th. Three days later, she moved on to Hollandia, where she operated for a month from 14 December 1944 to 15 January 1945. After a short tour of duty at Woendi -- between 18 and 25 January—she returned to Hollandia, where she served until late June.
On 2 July 1945, "Torchwood" took station in Leyte Gulf with the underwater defense forces and remained there through the end of the war.
Post-war operations.
On 17 November 1945, she headed back to the United States and, after stops at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, reached San Francisco on 22 December. On 7 January 1946, she headed south and, two days later, arrived in San Pedro, California, her base until 7 July when she sailed for Hawaii. The ship entered Pearl Harbor on the 16th, and remained there until 24 August when she got underway for the western Pacific.
After two very brief stops—one at Eniwetok and the other at Guam -- "Torchwood" arrived in Subic Bay in the Philippines on 14 September. There, she reported to the Commander, Philippine Sea Frontier, to await decommissioning for her transfer to the government of China by the Foreign Liquidation Commission. On 2 October, she departed Subic Bay and headed for China.
Decommissioned in China.
She arrived in "Shanghai" on the 7th and, on the 26th, was decommissioned. That same day, she was turned over to the Foreign Liquidation Commission which, in turn, transferred her to the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. "Torchwood"'s name was struck from the Navy list on 23 April 1947.

History.
Gonen was established on August 13, 1951 as a Nahal settlement, and was civilianised a year later by a group of Hebrew Scouts. It was the first Nahal settlement to convert to civilian control.
Its name is derived from the Book of Kings and symbolized the settlement's strategic location and proximity to the pre-Six-Day War Israel–Syria border, established in the 1949 Armistice Agreements. During the 1949–1967 period, the village's vicinity was the site of numerous skirmishes with the Syrian army.
Since 1994, the kibbutz has been in the process of conversion to a communal settlement.

Toyota Crown Majesta

The Toyota Crown Majesta is a full-size premium luxury automobile from Toyota.
The Crown Majesta appeared after the international introduction of the Toyota Celsior/Lexus LS in late 1989, and the Celsior was exclusive to "Toyopet Store" locations on a new platform. The Crown Majesta, positioned as a modern limousine alternative to the already existing Toyota Century, was exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called "Toyota Store". The Crown Majesta appeared before the Toyota Aristo, which was assigned to "Toyota Vista Store" locations and shared the Crown and Crown Majesta platform.
The Toyota Crown Majesta shares a stretched variant of the UZS platform series from the smaller Toyota Crown and Lexus GS/Toyota Aristo, however, it is not just an upper trim level of the Crown sedan, the Majesta is a separate car with unique styling and interior treatment. The Crown Majesta has recently been released in other countries in Asia such as China.
First-generation series S140.
The first Toyota Crown Majesta was introduced in Japan as a 4-door sedan in October 1991. It looked very similar to its smaller sibling, the Toyota Crown. It also bore a resemblance to the larger Toyota Celsior, which was a sedan that appeared in 1989. At first, the Toyota Crown Majesta was a trim-level variant of the Toyota Crown series, called the Crown Royal Saloon G. The Majesta was an ultra-luxurious variant of the Toyota Crown and was slightly wider and heavier, necessitating two engine choices: the 3.0 L 2JZ-GE engine, which produced ; and the 4.0L 1UZ-FE, which produced . In 1992, four-wheel steering was offered in compliance with the four-wheel-drive system, called 4WDi-Four. This boosted handling capabilities and gave increased traction. Advanced for this time, the Crown Majesta had an optional GPS navigation system, electric power steering, heated front and rear electric seats, four-wheel steering, and a head-up display that projected key information on the inside windshield surface above the instrument cluster. The Crown Majesta was the first Toyota to be equipped with vehicle stability control. Prices for the Crown Majesta started at US$32,100 for the lowest spec 3.0A model and rose to US$51,000 for the V8 with four-wheel steering. 
Second-generation series S150.
The Crown Majesta underwent its first redesign in 1995. Notable enhancements were made to the tail lamps to distinguish the model from the lower-spec Toyota Crown. The redesign made the vehicle similar to the Celsior and Lexus LS 400 (UCF20), which debuted in 1994. Changes were also made to the engine lineup. The 3.0 L 2JZ-GE engine stayed the same, but the V8 received a power increase to . Due to cost-cutting efforts within Toyota, the list of optional equipment offered was simplified.
At its introduction in 1996, it won the Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year award in Japan which it shared with the 1996 Crown.
In August 1997, the front grille was restyled and HID headlights were introduced. VVT-i technology was offered on the V8, improving the horsepower to . A new 5-speed automatic transmission was also introduced. Four-wheel steering was no longer offered. In addition, a new two-tone paint scheme offered an upmarket image for the Crown Majesta.
Third-generation series S170.
This version received a complete redesign, further incorporating styling elements of the popular Lexus LS. Wider vertical tail lamps were incorporated.
DVD-based GPS navigation was introduced, as well as a "Ottoman" foot rest for the rear passenger seats. This was achieved by enabling part of the seat cushion of the front passenger seat back to tilt rearward towards the rear seat passengers.
The 4000 cc 1UZ-FE DOHC V-8-cylinder engine remained, now rated at 280 hp. The trend among automakers towards large-diameter wheels with low-profile tires was ignored in favor of a good ride and better handling with smaller wheels.
The S170 Crown Majesta was made the official company car for senior-level Toyota management.
Fourth-generation series S180.
The fourth-generation Crown Majesta received a complete redesign when it was introduced on July 6, 2004. In August 2006, the Toyota Celsior was no longer offered in Japan, due to the introduction of the Lexus brand in Japan. The Crown Majesta replaced the Celsior, despite objections from Japanese customers. The 6-cylinder engine was removed. The engine was upgraded to the 3UZ-FE, shared with the USA-spec Lexus LS. The transmission was upgraded to a 6-speed, the four-wheel drive was improved, and air suspension was introduced. Intelligent adaptive front lighting and rear curtain airbags were added to improve safety. Enhancements were made to the interior of the vehicle, including a rear-view camera and parking assistance technology. A supercharger was also offered with the 6-speed transmission, allowing the engine to produce . Prices were around US$69,400 for the Crown Majesta AWD.
For model year 2006, G-BOOK was added to the list of standard features, along with a rear-view camera. A departure from previous models, the two-tone paint scheme was removed to target a younger audience.
Rebadge.
"For more information, see Hongqi (marque)".
In China, this generation of Toyota Crown Majesta was rebadged and has been sold as the Hongqi HQ3/HQ430 since 2006.
Fifth-generation series S200.
On March 26, 2009, the fifth generation was introduced. Design similarities between the Crown Majesta and the current Camry have been noted, especially in the grille. Although it was initially reported that the name "Crown" would be removed, establishing the Majesta as an independent car, this did not happen and the car remained the Crown Majesta. The body size expanded from the previous generation, now comparable to the Lexus LS.
As with the Lexus GS and LS, the 1UR-FSE engine is standard, however, the four-wheel-drive employed the 4.3 liter 3UZ-FE.
Interior.
Standard interior features include a 20-speaker Toyota Premium Sound system, a 1TB HDD navigation system, XM NavTraffic, a real-time traffic monitoring system with dynamic rerouting; Keyless SmartAccess with push-button start, Optitron instrument panel, auxiliary MP3 and MP4 player inputs, and a 5-position tire pressure display. A 24-hour concierge/emergency aid service, with the analogous G-Link navigation system is offered in Japan. Japanese market Crown sedans also feature MiniDisc compatibility, television reception, on board security surveillance cameras, and remote cellphone access. The seats are fully electric, and have a massage feature.
Exterior.
The design features body forms running the length of the car, with wheel arches, arrow-shaped chrome trim, a grille set slightly below the level of the headlamps, and a fastback rear decklid. Compared to the previous generation, the forward and aft coefficient of lift was reduced to 0.02 and 0.01, respectively, while aerodynamic drag remained the same. Exterior-wise, it has a profile similar to the Lexus LS, with identical overhangs in both front and rear; however, the rear passenger doors are noticeably longer in the stretched model.
Additional details of the design include adaptive headlamps housed in hand polished surrounds designed to look like Baccarat crystal tumblers and chrome exhaust vents integrated into the rear bumper. The fenders are produced using a 5200-ton press, which when introduced was the world's strongest stamping press. The model's paint finish is applied to bare-metal body panels which are first prepared by a six-axis buffing robot with 3D movements, the entire paint finish is wet-sanded twice by hand between layers of paint application. Front and rear window frames are each constructed from a single die-cast zinc piece, plated in chrome and then polished by hand.
Sixth-generation series S210.
Launched in Japan since September 9, 2013, the sixth-generation model replaced the outgoing model's V8 engine in favor of the 3.5L V6 hybrid powerplant inherited from the Lexus GS450h premium sedan. Fuel economy is now greatly improved to 18.2km/L under the JC08 test cycle. The wheelbase is 75mm longer than the 14th-generation Crown Royal and Athlete and it incorporates advanced safety and convenience equipment such as blind spot monitoring and a collision avoidance system. The sixth-generation Majesta is priced at 6.1 to 12.9 million Japanese Yen (including consumption tax) and monthly sales target for Japan is 500 units.

Stetson House

Stetson House is a colonial style historic house at Hanover Street in Hanover, Massachusetts. It was built in 1716 by Samuel "Drummer" Stetson and lived in for at least a hundred years. In its early years before Hanover's first church was built, people would sometimes use the house for prayer.
In the Common room there is a large fireplace (one of six in the house) and a Yule log that was lit for good luck on Christmas but was never allowed to burn all the way. At the church, if you fell asleep a person would tickle you with a feather attached to a tithing rod. It was above the fireplace. A grandfather clock made by John Bailey and given to the Stetson house was too big to fit in the house so they had to cut a depression in the floor. The mother Stetson sometimes baked pies in the deep oven and at about 4:00pm called the children to supper.
People donated furniture for the Music Room. Also in the Music room there is a portrait of John Barstow and his wife Betsy Ellen. Four front windows have special glass, each with 24 panes. The dining room is not used often, only on special occasions like Christmas or Thanksgiving.
The doors between the rooms were made crooked on purpose so that they would close by themselves and not let the heat out. Most of the rooms were not heated and foot warmers were used in the winter.
In 1979 it was added National Historic Register.

Cushing Homestead

Cushing Homestead is a historic house at 210 East Street in Hingham, Massachusetts. The home is a -story rear saltbox, and has traces of both 17th-century English style as well as later 18th-century Georgian. The two rooms that originally made up the house look much today as they likely did before the house was later enlarged.
The house was built in 1678 by town clerk and magistrate Daniel Cushing of Bachelor's Row for his son Peter Cushing, born in 1646. Peter Cushing later operated a mill on land across from the home. The home is one of Hingham's oldest and was added to the National Historic Register in 1973. It has also been designated a Massachusetts Historic Landmark. The house sits on a ten-acre lot.
The white clapboard structure centers on a five-bay facade that faces south. Inside, the house has sponge painting believed to have been done applied before 1700, as well as an enormous original working fireplace. The property of the Cushing Homestead includes a barn, corncrib and a forge. Also on the property are the ancient mill site and dam, a former Native American fishing hole, old stone walls and markers, and a large hayfield – all speaking to Hingham's early agricultural beginnings.
"It is probably one of the most important homesteads in Hingham, beautifully maintained inside and out,’’ says Hingham-based architectural historian Monique Lehner.
The property's barn, said to be the oldest in the United States, is constructed of timber that originally was part of Hingham's first meeting house, replaced by Old Ship Church in 1681. The barn is a shingle-covered structure in a pitched roof style, and has ornamental red trim. The house has been occupied for over three centuries by descendants in the male line of the original builder, the son of Puritan Matthew Cushing, who arrived in Hingham from Norfolk, England, in 1638.
Among the Cushing family members who have occupied the home since it was built was Capt. Peter Cushing (1741–1783), grandson and namesake of the first owner. A selectman and constable of Hingham, Capt. Cushing commanded a company of troops during the Revolutionary War under fellow townsman General Benjamin Lincoln.
An elm tree on the property, a local landmark for years, was famous as the place where pastor John Brown preached to a group of Minutemen from Cohasset in 1775. The soldiers afterwards took part in the Siege of Boston under Col. (later Brigadier General) John Greaton.

Army of God (Bonekickers)

Army of God is the first episode of the BBC archaeology drama, Bonekickers, airing on July 8 2008. It was written by "Life on Mars" creator Matthew Graham, and filmed in the City of Bath. A small amount of the episode, as with the following episodes, relies on a flashback to the time that the archaeologists are studying.
Characters.
Dr. Gillian Magwilde - Julie Graham<br>
Dr. Ben Ergha - Adrian Lester<br>
Professor Gregory "Dolly" Parton - Hugh Bonneville<br>
Vivian "Viv" Davis - Gugu Mbatha-Raw<br>
Professor Daniel Mastiff - Michael Maloney<br>
Edward Laygass - Paul Rhys<br>
"James" - Paul Nicholls<br>
"Colm" - Oliver Jackson Cohen<br>
Plot.
The episode is set in the City of Bath, and Gillian Magwilde and her team have been called out to a building site, after builders found Arabian dirhems buried in the site. After being told off briefly by Ben Ergha, Vivian Davis is revealed to be the student archaeologist studying with the team. Gillian has a cold, snubbing attitude towards Viv in the beginning, telling her to simply get on with some cataloguing. But after further inspection of the computerised earth scanner, Viv notices that there is more to the dig site.
Gillian and the rest of the team proceed to excavate the second place, now distinctly forming a crucifix shape when looked at from above. Before long, a skeleton is found, with more dirhems scattered around. This leads to much speculation, as the crusades happened in the Holy Land, not in England.
Before long, however, Gillian and Ben have to leave to go to the launching of a book written by the head of the archaeology department, Daniel Mastiff, entitled "Sex Rites of the Ancients". After a few witty remarks on Gillian's part, the two head back to the dig site.
Meanwhile, however, Viv has been looking through the earth, when she finds a 13th century sandal, and proceeds to show it to the hospice nurse that she has been talking to. The nurse quickly points out another mound, and after inspection, they both proceed to pull a cut of wood out. A splinter from the wood gets stuck in the nurse's finger, as Viv takes the wood back to the lab.
After Gregory "Dolly" Parton completes a test on a scrap of material, the body found is revealed to be a Knight Templar, due to the distinct red cross revealed by the UV light. This raises further questions about Templars in England, with the only explanation being the exile of the Knights by King Philip I of France.
Viv gives Gillian the piece of wood that she found, and after sending Ben to do a dendrochronology test on it, the rest of the team discuss what could have happened. Before serious speculation took place, however, the dendrochronology test was complete, with the wood dating back to 32AD, and with blood soaked into it with metallic traces. Thoughts arise here about whether the wood could be part of the True Cross.
Meanwhile, two Christian fanatics named Jack and Colm prepare themselves with swords for what they call a 'war', and make their way to a mosque, where they pray to God in the sunlight. Four young Muslims enter the building, and after Jack threatens to kill them with his sword, they run away. Jack and Colm leave the place.
While Viv is looking for spare clothes for Gillian, she finds a piece of paper on the back of a picture of Gillian's mother, which has a picture of a sword on it. However, after one of

Hyeopdo

The Hyeopdo (Modern South Korean pronunciation: /çʌp.do/) was a pole weapon used in Korea. It is very similar to the Japanese naginata or nagamaki. It was also called "micheomdo" (미첨도), which could be translated as 'eyebrow sword' because the curved blade resembled an eyebrow. The first written reference to a hyeopdo is in a Korean martial arts manual from the 17th century called the Muyejebo Beonyeoksokjip (무예예보 번역속집).
Design.
The design varied somewhat between makers, but usually the pole was about 1.5 meters long and the blade was about 63 centimeters long.
Use.
The "hyeopdo" was considered an important weapon because of its effectiveness. It was much easier to handle than the bigger and heavier "woldo". In the Muyedobotongji, another martial arts manual, one form for use is given, called "hyeopdo chongbo" (협도총보, 挾刀總譜).

Rehue

Rehue or rewe is the sacred altar used by the Mapuche of Chile in many of their ceremonies. 
Alter.
It is a tree trunk set in the ground and surrounded by canes of colihue located in row and adorned with white, blue or yellow flags and branches of coihues, maitén, lengas and other trees of the area. At its summit it has a representation of a human face with seven steps rising up from the earth to this summit. It symbolizes the connection with the cosmos. This rehue is a symbol of great importance that is used in important celebrations like the Machitún, Guillatún, We Tripantu (Mapuche New Year ) and others.
Social and Political Unit.
Called "rehue" or "regua" in colonial chronicles, the word referred to the grouping of various Mapuche families (lof or lov) who occupied the same locality and shared the same rehue altar. Nine of these rehue would form an Aillarehue (nine altars), a small confederation that would gather for war or other common purposes and formed a region or province.

Rockland Trust

Rockland Trust is a commercial bank based in Rockland, Massachusetts that serves Southeastern Massachusetts, Coastal Massachusetts, Cape Cod, and Boston's MetroWest. Established in 1907 as Rockland Trust Company, it is one of few local banks that retain their original name and independent ownership after more than 100 years. (Rockland Trust Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of Independent Bank Corp., which is publicly traded on NASDAQ (INDB).) Rockland Trust is the largest publicly traded commercial bank headquartered in Massachusetts, with $5.8 billion in assets and over 1000 employees. Rockland Trust offers a wide range of commercial, retail, commercial banking products and services, business and consumer loans, insurance products and services, and investment management services from: 77 retail branches, 10 commercial lending centers, and 4 mortgage banking centers located throughout Eastern Massachusetts and on Cape Cod; and 4 investment management offices located in Southeastern Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, and in Rhode Island. Corporate headquarters are in Hanover, Massachusetts.
History.
Rockland Trust's 1927 petition to open a branch in Hull, Massachusetts sparked a state-level debate on whether to allow "kangaroo banking" (banks opening branches in non-adjacent towns). The proposal was opposed by Alvan T. Fuller, then Governor of Massachusetts, and Hingham Trust, a bank based closer to Hull. The petition was finally granted by the Massachusetts legislature.
In 1910, Rockland Trust began offering "Automobile Banking" — an innovative program that offered banking services to nearby towns (including Hull, Massachusetts) from the window of a special adapted car. The program was so well received that it continued through 1955.
In 2008, Rockland Trust acquired Slades Ferry Bank.
In 2009, Rockland Trust acquired Benjamin Franklin Bank, adding 11 new branches and expanding into Boston's MetroWest area.

IPv6 deployment

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the next generation of the Internet Protocol that is in various stages of deployment on the Internet. It was designed as a replacement for the current version, IPv4, that has been in use since 1982 and is in the final stages of exhausting its unallocated address space.
In December 2008, despite marking its 10th anniversary as a Standards Track protocol, IPv6 still accounted for a minuscule fraction of the used addresses and the traffic in the publicly accessible Internet which is still dominated by IPv4. A study by Google, reported in November 2008, indicated that penetration was still less than one percent of Internet traffic in any country. The leaders were Russia (0.76%), France (0.65%), Ukraine (0.64%), Norway (0.49%), and the United States (0.45%). Although Asia led in terms of absolute deployment numbers, the relative penetration was smaller (e.g., China: 0.24%).
In October 2011, 263 (85%) of the 294 top-level domains (TLDs) in the Internet supported IPv6 to access their domain name servers, and 234 (76%) zones contained IPv6 glue records, and approximately 3.4 million domains (3%) had IPv6 address records in their zones. Of all networks in the global BGP routing table, 12% had IPv6 protocol support.
By 2011 all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations. Microsoft Windows has supported IPv6 since Windows 2000, and in production-ready state beginning with Windows XP. Windows Vista and later have improved IPv6 support. Mac OS X since Panther (10.3), Linux 2.6, FreeBSD, and Solaris also have mature production implementations. Some implementations of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file transfer protocol make use of IPv6 to avoid NAT issues common for IPv4 private networks.
Cellular telephone systems present a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service is making the transition from 3G to "next-generation" 4G technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. This mandates the use of IPv6 for such networks. In 2009 U.S. cellular operator Verizon released technical specifications for devices to operate on its "next-generation" networks. The specification mandates IPv6 operation according to the "3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009)", and deprecates IPv4 as an optional capability.
In the early 2000s, governments increasingly required support for IPv6 in new equipment. The U.S. government, for example, specified in 2005 that the network backbones of all federal agencies had to be upgraded to IPv6 by June 30, 2008; this was completed before the deadline. The government of People's Republic of China implemented a five-year plan for deployment of IPv6 called the "China Next Generation Internet" (see below).
Major providers of Internet services, both ISPs and content providers, also began to implement IPv6 access into their products.
Deployment evaluation tools.
Google publishes statistics on IPv6 adoption among Google users. A graph of IPv6 adoption since 2008 and a map of IPv6 deployment by country are available.
A global view into the growing IPv6 routing tables can be obtained with the SixXS Ghost Route Hunter. This tool provides a list of all allocated IPv6 prefixes and marks with colors the ones that are actually being announced into the Internet BGP tables. When a prefix is announced, it means that the ISP at least can receive IPv6 packets for their prefix.
The integration of IPv6 on existing network infrastructures current at any time can also be monitored from other sources, for example:
IPv6 testing, evaluation, and certification.
A few organizations are involved with international IPv6 test and evaluation, ranging from the United States Department of Defense to the University of New Hampshire.
Deployment by country.
Canada.
At this time, IPv6 deployment is slow but ongoing, with major western Canadian ISPs (notably Shaw Communications, Distributel and Telus) lacking in support for its residential customers, and the majority of their business customers (including server packages).
China.
The China Next Generation Internet (CNGI, 中国下一代互联网) project is a five-year plan initiated by the Chinese government with the purpose of gaining a significant position in the development of the Internet through the early adoption of IPv6. China showcased CNGI's IPv6 infrastructure during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, being the first time a major world event has had a presence on the IPv6 Internet (at http://ipv6.beijing2008.cn/en). At the time of the event, it was believed that the Olympics provided the largest showcase of IPv6 technology since the inception of IPv6. The deployment of IPv6 was widespread in all related applications, from data networking and camera transmissions for sporting events, to civil applications, such as security cameras and taxis. The events were streamed live over the Internet and networked cars were able to monitor traffic conditions readily, all network operations of the Games being conducted using IPv6.
Also, the CERNET (China Education and Research NETwork, 中国教育和科研计算机网, 教育网) set up native IPv6 (CERNET2), and since then many academic institutions in China joined CERNET2 for IPv6 connectivity. CERNET-2 is probably the widest deployment of IPv6 in China. It is managed and operated jointly by 25 universities. Students in Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, for example, get native IPv6.
Hungary.
In Hungary Externet was the first ISP starting deploying IPv6 on its network in 2008 August. The service was commercially available since 2009 May.
Magyar Telekom was running tests on its production environments since the beginning of 2009. Free customer trials started on November 2, 2009, for those on ADSL or Fiber Optic. Customers are given a /128 via DHCP-ND unless they register their DUID in which case they receive a /56 - using a static configuration results in a single /64.
According to information on telecompaper.com, UPC Hungary will start deploying IPv6 in mid-2013, finishing it in 2013.
So far no other Hungarian ISP offers IPv6 connectivity.
New Zealand.
Surveys conducted by the New Zealand IPv6 Task Force indicate that awareness of IPv6 has reached a near universal level among New Zealand’s large public and private sector organisations, with adoption mostly occurring as part of normal network refresh cycles. Most of New Zealand's ISP and carrier community have a test environment for IPv6 and many are now bringing IPv6 products and services on-stream. An increasing number of New Zealand Government websites are available over IPv6, including the Ministry of Defence (New Zealand), Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand), Ministry of Social Development and the Department of Internal Affairs.
Philippines.
The government is in process of upgrading its facilities. Globe Telecom has already set in motion the transition of its core IP network to IPv6, noting that it is now fully prepared even as the Internet runs out of IPv4 addresses. Globe claims it is the first local telecommunication company to test IPv6 with Department of Science and Technology (Philippines). In some cases, like test networks or users, IPv6 or both maybe present.
Sweden.
Operators offering native IPv6 access for business clients and collocation customers include:
Events.
World IPv6 Day.
The Internet Society promoted June 8, 2011, as "World IPv6 Day". The event was described as a "test drive" for full IPv6 rollouts.
World IPv6 Launch.
The Internet Society declared June 6, 2012, to be the date for "World IPv6 Launch", with participating major websites enabling IPv6 permanently, participating ISPs offering IPv6 connectivity, and participating router manufacturers offering devices enabled for IPv6 by default.
Wikimedia has been using IPv6 since this date.

18 cm kurze Kanone M 80

The 18 cm kurze Kanone M 80 (short cannon) was a heavy siege howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. Designed to replace the M 61 series of siege guns the M 80 family of siege guns offered greater range and armor penetration than the older guns. The proven steel-bronze was used for the barrel and the iron carriage lacked any system to absorb recoil other than the traditional recoil wedges placed underneath and behind the wheels of the carriage. These wedges helped to absorb the recoil force and encouraged the wheels to run forward to bring the gun back into battery. Generally a wooden firing platform was constructed for these guns in action to provide a level and smooth surface. For transport the barrel was removed from the carriage by a crane and carried separately.
These siege guns were no longer useful against modern armored fortresses by the outbreak of World War I and many saw action in the field to fill the need for heavy howitzers.

<doc id="18558539" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18558539" title="Nitrocellulose slide">
Nitrocellulose slide

A nitrocellulose slide (or nitrocellulose film slide) is a biochemical research tool that is used to bind biological material, often protein, for colorimetric and fluorescence detection assays. For this purpose, a nitrocellulose slide is generally considered to be superior to glass, because it binds a great deal more protein, and protects the tertiary structure of the protein (and other biological material, i.e.: cells). Typically, nitrocellulose slides have a thin, opaque film of nitrocellulose on a standard 25mm × 75 mm glass microscope slide. The film is extremely sensitive to contact, and to foreign material; contact causes deformation and deposition of material, especially liquids. Various configurations of the film are available.
Due to their high surface roughness, conventional white nitrocellulose films scatter and reflect large amounts of excitation and emission light during the fluorescence detection in the microarray scanner. In addition, nitrocellulose exhibits a natural autofluorescence at the detection wavelengths commonly used. Both these factors lead to a high background fluorescent signal from these membrane slides. To overcome this problem, a new process has been developed to generate black membranes that absorb the scattered light, significantly reducing the background auto-fluorescence and thus offering a very low and homogenous auto-fluorescence to achieve a significantly improved dynamic range. These slides are commercially available through Schott AG. Nevertheless, conventional white nitrocellulose films continue to be the dominant surface for many protein microarray applications because the claims above have not proved relevant to end user requirements. Regardless, nitrocellulose slide manufacturers like Grace Bio-Labs continue to develop new nitrocellulose surfaces to further optimize their use in protein microarrays.
Note that a nitrocellulose slide is subtly different than a nitrocellulose membrane, which usually filters protein from solution (i.e.: physician's office pregnancy tests), but that it serves a similar goal: to detect the presence and/or concentration level of certain biological material.
Nitrocellulose slides are being used mainly in proteomics to do protein microarrays with automated systems that print the slides and record results. Microarrays of cell analytes, arrays of cell lysate, antibody microarrays, tissue printing, immunoarrays, etc. are also possible with the slide.
Nitrocellulose coated glass slides that are suitable for protein microarray applications are available from a number of commercial vendors.

Raphael Noteware Hamilton, S.J. (November 5, 1892 – April 19, 1980) was an American Jesuit and professor of history at Marquette University. He is also considered the founder of Marquette University Special Collections and University Archives.
Education (1913–1932).
Hamilton attended Creighton University, achieving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1913. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1913 and was ordained a priest in 1926. Father Hamilton, S.J., went to graduate school at St. Louis University, attaining his master's and doctoral degrees in history in 1919 and 1932 respectively.
Marquette University (1930–1973).
Father Hamilton, S.J., held several positions at Marquette University. They included assistant professor, 1930–1932; associate professor, 1932–1957; chair of the history department, 1932–1956; dean of the graduate school, 1940–1944; and professor emeritus, 1964. In addition, he served the role of university historian. Hamilton was an accomplished author on the activities of French explorers in North America. In particular, he was an expert on the life of Pere Jacques Marquette, S.J, the namesake of the university. Father Hamilton taught an extensive array of courses while at Marquette University, but specialized in American Colonial History.
Marquette University Archives and Special Collections (1961–1980).
In addition to his career as an educator he was also responsible for the founding of Marquette University’s Archives and Special Collections in 1961. His second career began in 1961, when he was asked to organize the Marquette Archives, and from 1964 he devoted his full to time to this new task. Along with the University Archives, he invited other collections, and developed a body of records that documented the trend of American Catholic social changes in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Under Hamilton’s guidance the newly founded archives came to include the papers of Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the J.R.R. Tolkien Manuscripts and a number of rare complete set of 14th century antiphonals.
Post-professional life (1973–1980).
Father Hamilton, S.J., retired in 1973, yet he continued to have a close relationship to the university until his death. He died on April 19, 1980, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at St. Mary's Nursing home after months of failing health.

Aurora Feint

Aurora Feint was a video game series developed by Danielle Cassley and Jason Citron for iOS. "Aurora Feint The Beginning" was released in the first wave of App Store applications in July 2008 and is a free single-player game which combines the geometric shape manipulation of "Tetris Attack" with the character-building aspects of a role-playing game. "Aurora Feint II: The Beginning" was released in December 2008 and adds graphical and community features. "Aurora Feint II: The Arena" was released in November 2008, adding multiplayer features and is billed by the developers as the first casual asynchronous massively multiplayer online game. "Aurora Feint II: Tower Puzzles" was released in December 2008 and provides dozens of visual brain teasers based on the "tower" locations in the other titles.
All versions of "Aurora Feint" have been removed from AppStore since July 14th, 2012.
Gameplay.
The game mechanics are based on Nintendo's "Panel de Pon", and the games in the series share some similarities including the following components: the Mine, the Store, the Smith, and the Tower. In the Mine, players manipulate blocks into combinations of three or more to collects crystals and resources. In the Store, players spend resources and crystals to acquire blueprints and magicbooks. In the Smith, players complete blueprints by collecting a certain amount of resources within an allotted time, gaining access to new types of weapons. In the Tower, player complete magicbooks by solving puzzles within an allotted number of moves, gaining improved mining efficiency.
"Aurora Feint II: The Arena" adds a range of additional capabilities including online player v. player dueling, chat capabilities in its "tavern," news feeds, additional character classes, and leaderboards. Characters developed in "Aurora Feint The Beginning" can be transferred into "Aurora Feint II: The Arena".
Plot.
Details of the plot and story are limited but text in the game's opening trailer provides some hints:
"What is it that separates reality from fantasy? For one little girl, the only way to survive our reality is to live in her fantasy."
Development.
The developers wrote in a forum post and discussed in an interview that the initial release of "Aurora Feint The Beginning" was created over the course of 10 weeks. Soon after its initial release, reports circulated of privacy concerns regarding the game's community features. According to a forum post by the game's developers, on July 22 Apple removed the game from the iTunes App Store. The developers responded by explaining that the contact list was not actually stored on their server, asking for user feedback on alternatives, and asking for support on bringing the game back to the App Store. On July 24, the iTunes App Store began carrying version 1.0.0.1 of the game. According to the developers, the new version addressed the privacy concerns.
Reception.
"Aurora Feint The Beginning" was met with acclaim compared to other free games in the App Store. One reviewer described it as "the most fun and addictive of the early iPhone games."
"Aurora Feint II: The Arena" was praised in a preview release for its ""Lord of the Rings" aesthetic" and for standing apart from other match three games.

12-cm Kanone M 80

The 12cm Kanone M 80 was a light siege gun used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. Designed to replace the M 61 series of siege guns the M 80 family of siege guns offered greater range and armor penetration than the older guns. The proven steel-bronze was used for the barrel and the iron carriage lacked any system to absorb recoil other than the traditional recoil wedges placed underneath and behind the wheels of the carriage. These wedges helped to absorb the recoil force and encouraged the wheels to run forward to bring the gun back into battery. Generally a wooden firing platform was constructed for these guns in action to provide a level and smooth surface. Shortly after these guns were adopted a hydraulic recoil cylinder was adapted to absorb the recoil forces. It was attached to the underside of the carriage and the firing platform. For transport the barrel was removed from the carriage by a crane and carried separately.
While designed to penetrate the walls of fortifications the 12 cm siege gun was no longer useful against modern armored fortresses by the outbreak of World War I and its combination of long-range and light weight saw many in the field to fill the need for long-range artillery.

Paragon Park Carousel

Paragon Park Carousel is an historic carousel at 1 Wharf Avenue in Hull, Massachusetts.
The carousel was built in 1928 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
Historical Background of Nantasket’s Paragon Carousel (PTC #85)
History.
19th Century: Nantasket a World Class Summer Resort.
During the 19th century, a number of resort areas were developed in and around Boston to provide summertime pleasure for its residents. In the late 19th century, Nantasket, or Hull, was known as the premier resort in New England, boasting the largest summer hotel in the nation. The Nantasket Beach area attracted many interesting summer visitors in its "Golden Age". President Grover Cleveland vacationed at one of the grand hotels, President Calvin Coolidge maintained a summer home here, Daniel Webster was said to have frequented a public house in 1820's, and Lizzie Borden's attorney was a member of the Hull Yacht Club.
Beginning in the summer of 1818, paddle steamboats would run from Boston to Nantasket Beach, carrying up to two thousand visitors per trip. Ranked as one of the oldest routes in the country, a fleet of vessels eventually grew to carry more than two million passengers to Hull in the summer of 192. One hundred thousand people would arrive at Steamboat Wharf each day to the shores of Nantasket.
Along with the magnificent beach, the grand hotels and world-class restaurants, the amusements of Paragon could be found in other Massachusetts towns including Revere and Norumbega (Newton, on the site of the Newton Marriott Hotel). At one point, more than a dozen wooden carved carousels could be found in the Boston metropolitan area, close at hand by ferry or trolley. 
1928: The Paragon Carousel.
With the advent of the automobile, the Boston metropolitan resorts lost favor to Cape Cod and northern New England. One by one, the merry-go-rounds disappeared by fire or sale. After a major fire at Paragon Park in Hull, a new large, elaborate carousel, PTC #85, was installed in 1928, to replace the one destroyed by the blaze. 
This was the 85th out of 89 hand-carved and painted carousels created by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC), renowned maker of hand-carved carousels in the Philadelphia, or realistic, style. (Toboggan meant roller coaster) PTC #85 included 66 horses and two rare Roman Chariots, each pulled by two horses, carved by the Dentzel Company, founder of the Philadelphia style, and purchased when the last of the Dentzels died. Its scalloped canopy was one of the most beautiful ever constructed for any carousel. 
1984.
The End of an Era on Nantasket Beach. Paragon Park is dismantled, sold at auction.
In 1984, the amusements of Paragon Park were dismantled and sold at auction, and the land was developed into condominiums. Local activists persuaded the land's developer to purchase the carousel. A year later, when the developer decided to sell it, three investors were found to rescue it at a dramatic auction, while the MDC agreed to provide space for it at the heart of Nantasket Beach, just a half-block from its original location. The three investors relocated the 120 ton carousel and its original building in April, 1986 (the move made Ripley’s “Believe It or Not”) to this new prominent location, reinstalled a Wurlitzer band organ, and began restoring the horses to their original paint colors. Twenty four of the horses have been fully restored to date. 
Ten years later, when the business interests of the three investors changed, the carousel was again put on the market in August 1995 with a deadline of two months to raise $1.1 million before it would once more be committed to auction. 
1996: Rescued from the Auction Block.
A group of people came together, many of who had been working to revitalize Hull for years, to rescue the carousel from the auction block once more. They formed the non-profit organization, The Friends of the Paragon Carousel, Inc. When significant funds were raised by November 1, the owners agreed to give the Friends additional time to secure financing before signing with an auction house. Eventually, the Friends secured funding through loans, grants, and a reduction in price to be able to sign final papers for the carousel's purchase allowing it to open for the 1996 season, the last carousel in the Boston metropolitan area. 
2010 and beyond.
Today, the antique Paragon Carousel is the last vestige of Paragon Park and is a lasting reminder of the "Golden Age" of Hull, when the town was teeming with thousands of visitors each day in the summer for decades.
The fundraising efforts for the Carousel continue, as the historic amusement is still encumbered with a substantial mortgage and ever increasing maintenance and operational expenses. Fundraising efforts are always underway to retire the debt, while other fundraising efforts including special events, the seeking of grants and corporate sponsorships, are raised to sustain a restoration fund for the Paragon Carousel.
While operating expenses are usually covered by the ticket price during the summer "riding" season, fundraising is a challenging and ongoing activity for the Board of Directors throughout the year.
In 2013 the Friends of the Paragon Carousel created and opened the Paragon Park Museum.

Telegraph Hill is a historic site in Hull, Massachusetts. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It is now part of Fort Revere Park.
History.
The site was first used as a fort in 1776 to defend the port of Boston. The first telegraph tower was built in 1827. Several other telegraph stations later occupied the site until 1938, when radio communications made the site obsolete. 
In 1903, United States Government built a 120 foot high, 25 foot diameter reinforced concrete tower to contain a 20 foot diameter, 118,000-gallon steel water storage tank to serve Fort Revere. Erected by the Hennebique Construction Company, the tower was one of the earliest concrete water towers in the United States, and likely the first in New England. It also had a secondary benefit as an observation tower for the Army. The tower was restored in 1975 was designated an American Water Landmark in 2003. It was periodically open to the public until mid-2012 when it was closed due to safety concerns.

<doc id="18558694" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18558694" title="The Silkie (novel)">
The Silkie (novel)

The Silkie is a fix-up science fiction novel by A. E. van Vogt, first published in complete form in 1969. The component stories had previously been published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine.
Plot introduction.
Taking its inspiration from the Celtic legend of the Selkie, the novel describes a race of apparent humans with the ability to change into other forms. One, like the Selkie of legend, can live underwater. Another can survive and travel unprotected in outer space. In all three forms the Silkies can wield mental powers over energy to some degree.
After a prologue which purports to explain the origin of the Silkies as an experiment in genetic manipulation, the action moves forward over a hundred years to a future in which the Silkies are numerous and live on Earth. Humanity has assimilated them by means of the Special People, who can establish telepathic rapport with the Silkies. All Silkies are male, and most are married to women of the Special People. They are employed as police in space, and most are comfortable with that role. One dedicated Silkie, Nat Cemp, encounters three different alien races, and with each encounter he gains more powers and learns more about the true nature of the Silkies, and of the Universe.
As with other Van Vogt works, the novel introduces a psychological element similar to General semantics. Here the Silkies use the so-called "Logic of Levels". Instead of the symbol/reality dichotomy of General Semantics, the Logic of Levels substitutes the concept of behaviors and instincts as complex neurological structures and feedback loops, simpler levels being built on more complex ones. By manipulating these complexes with their powers the Silkies can defeat adversaries, who find themselves caught in self-amplifying feedback from their own instincts and desires.
Plot summary.
The novel has four sections, each consisting of a story previously published as part of a series.
Prologue to the Silkie.
A young woman, eking out an existence with her father on a boat moored somewhere in Haiti, learns of a medical man with a possible secret of eternal youth. Suspecting a swindle, but keen to get close to any source of money, she joins the various elderly expatriates in a trek to Echo Island, where the supposed genius, Dr. Sawyer, is living. Instead she is confronted with a young man who emerges from swimming underwater, transforming from a fish-like form to human as he does so. He identifies himself as the product of Sawyer's work, and tells her that he and Sawyer need women to bear his children. The story concludes with him saying, "I'm a Silkie. The first Silkie."
The Silkie.
Nat Cemp, a Silkie travelling through space under his own power, is hailed by a ship full of Variants. These are the result of further experimentation on the Silkie genome. Each has Silkie abilities to some degree. This particular ship consists mostly of aquatic Variants. Cemp is conducted into the ship, shifting from his hard, bony, space-travelling form into his aquatic shape as he does so.
Cemp meets a powerful boy aged about 10 who claims to be his son. Since Silkies have to return to water to breed every 9.5 years, and are not allowed to meet their children afterwards, the boy's claim is credible. He tells Cemp that he wishes to return to Earth to learn how to tame his unusual powers.
Cemp agrees to this, even though it means he himself will not be allowed to return to Earth as he needs to, in order to complete another breeding cycle. However, after Cemp contacts Earth and then leaves the ship, the boy reveals himself to be a malevolent shape-shifting alien.
Cemp returns to Earth clandestinely in order to see his wife Joanne, but finds that the alien has taken on her form and is waiting in his house. The alien, known as the Kibmadine, displays Silkie-like control over energy during the fight which occurs after Cemp discovers the deception. The alien flees.
With the aid of the main computer at Silkie Authority, Cemp analyzes his own sense-impressions of the Kibmadine. The result is a picture of a race which enters into an erotic-cannibalistic relationship with its victims, taking on their shapes and then consuming them. Armed with this, Cemp meets the Kibmadine and uses Logic of Levels to send it into an amplified memory of the previous victims. Taking on the shape of the former race, the alien then consumes itself.
Silkies in Space.
Silkies all across Earth are confronted by apparent doubles of themselves, who then flee as space-travelling Silkies. Cemp traces them to an asteroid making a close approach to the Sun, inside which is a mysterious power which both controls these new Silkies and also gives them abilities that Cemp and the Earth Silkies cannot match.
On the asteroid is a complete population of Silkies, both male and female, who can take on any shape, unlike Earth Silkies. This discovery threatens the relationship between Silkies and humans, especially between Silkies and their wives. Apparently the story of Dr. Sawyer was a fraud, intended to allow Silkies to live on Earth after the asteroid first approached the Sun. On subsequent returns the space Silkies had to deal with the discovery of the Special People and the creation of Variants. The latest return is part of a long-term plan.
However, just as the Earth authorities come to an agreement with the space Silkies and the unknown power behind them, a new force encloses the Earth and drags it from orbit. Cemp manages to escape, only to find the Earth now reduced in size and mounted as a trophy inside the asteroid. The being in the asteroid, known as the Glis, seems to come from an ancient time when the laws of nature were different. The Glis openly threatens to destroy all Silkies if Cemp moves against it, as the asteroid moves many light-years from the Sun. Cemp, however, finds the Logic of Levels key to the Glis's true nature and trips a feedback which forces it out of its state of retarded development, into the next phase. The Glis becomes a huge pink star, liberating thousands of planets from its collection to orbit around it. Many are dead, having been in storage for too long, but on the liberated Earth mere seconds have passed and all are well. Now humanity and the space Silkies must learn to co-exist on an Earth which is part of a huge new Solar System.
Enemy of the Silkies.
While exploring the new planets, one of the Earth Silkies is killed by an unknown force. Cemp tries to investigate, but meets hostility from the other space Silkies. It is possible the victim recognized the nature of the attacker before dying, out of some ancient racial memory.
Cemp eventually confronts a powerful alien called a Nijian, which seems to be able to manipulate time and space itself. Using one of the Glis's weapons, he survives the encounter, but Nijians begin kidnapping Silkies and Special People from Earth. Alarmingly, this means they learn the Logic of Levels, one of the few weapons which might work against them.
Cemp learns that each Nijian lives alone on a planet, ruling its people like a god. Like the Glis, the Nijians seem to come from an ancient time, when time and space were plastic and could be ruled by Will. Pushing his shape-shifting abilities, Cemp is able to take on the form of the Nijians. Using Logic of Levels, he starts a sequence of reactions in them which infects each one and passes to another Nijian along the communications links they maintain. The self-destruction caused by this collapses reality itself, until Cemp's awareness is the only thing left in existence. Cemp realizes that, while in the form of a Nijian, he can imagine any kind of Universe and bring it into being. He decides to imagine one without the Nijians, the Glis or the Kibmadine. He restores the Earth to its place in orbit around the Sun, also decides to make all humans into Silkies, abolishing the divisions threatening to tear the Earth apart. He then enters this universe and re-joins his people, and especially his wife.
Themes.
As can be seen from the summary, this novel is one where the author cast caution to the winds in search of awe-inspiring concepts. The writing in the prologue is surprisingly prosaic, however. Its description of a life on the margin in Haiti uses a style not unlike more mainstream authors. The subsequent chapters exhibit the sudden, and occasionally jarring episodes of raw power and wonder that Van Vogt is known for. The few other characters, such as Cemp's wife Joanne and his friend at Silkie Authority, Charlie Baxter, appear as needed to move the plot along, and are quickly moved offstage afterward. Cemp's intense love for Joanne appears via the kind of short scene Van Vogt preferred to write, but otherwise does not inform his character.

The play has been called "an urban legend" by New York Times critic Jason Zinoman because of its long and storied history. Perfect Crime was originally optioned for Broadway in 1980, just after author Manzi graduated from the Yale School of Drama. At age 25, Manzi, then starring as Mozart in Amadeus on Broadway, was the youngest American author ever to have a play optioned for Broadway. After producer Morton Gottlieb, (Deathtrap), wanted to change the play's title to "Guilty Hands" Manzi lost interest and went to Hollywood to write screenplays, including one of the many versions of the film Clue. The play ultimately began its life several years later in 1987, in the heart of Greenwich Village at the Courtyard Playhouse on Grove Street, produced by the Actors Collective, a not-for-profit theater company whose artistic director was Warren Manzi. Commercial producer Armand Hyatt moved the show immediately after its four-week limited run to an Off-Broadway venue.
After opening on April 18, 1987, "Perfect Crime" has since played over 10,000 performances. It played in several theaters during its early years: the 47th Street Theater, The Harold Clurman Theater, Theatre Four, the McGinn-Cazale Theater and Intar before settling into a long run at the Duffy Theater at 46th Street and Broadway, in a renovated burlesque house above the Times Square landmark, the Howard Johnson's. After that property was sold in 2005, Perfect Crime found a home at the then-new Snapple Theater Center located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway in NYC's Times Square, where it remains.
Catherine Russell.
One of the most frequent associations with the play is the story of its leading lady, Catherine Russell, who has performed the role of Margaret Thorne Brent from the beginning of the play's run in 1987. She has missed only four performances (to attend her siblings' weddings). She has never taken a sick day or a vacation day. The subject of Russell's longevity has been the focus of national and international coverage including People magazine and Entertainment Tonight. Russell currently holds the world record for the most performances as a character in a play. The play will have its 11,000th performance on February 19, 2014.; BroadwayWorld.com notes that Russell has spent almost 23,000 hours, or nearly three years of her life, onstage in the role.
Reception.
The play has received overwhelmingly negative reviews with a 1 out of 5 rating average on Yelp! and a 2 out of 5 rating average on TripAdvisor.

Fútbol 
South America shares with Europe the supremacy over the sport, as all national team winners in FIFA World Cup history and all winning teams at the FIFA Club World Cup came from these two continents.
Brazil detains the world record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations hosted the tournament including its first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978). Brazil is also set to be a host country for the second time in 2014.
South America is home to the longest running international Football tournament; Copa América, which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay have won the Copa America a record 15 times, beating hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal on 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa America). The continent has produced many of the most famous and most talented players including Diego Maradona, Pelé, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaká, Teófilo Cubillas, César Cueto, Enzo Francescoli, Arsenio Erico, Alberto Spencer, Carlos Valderrama, Ivan Zamorano, Elias Figueroa, Alexis Sánchez, Antonio Valencia, Juan Arango, Neymar, Radamel Falcao, and Lionel Messi.
Basketball.
Basketball is particularly popular in South America, one of the most important achievements was Argentina gold medal in the Men's Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Also they won the World Championship in 1950.
In Brazil, basketball used to be very popular with the Brazilian national basketball team winning the World Championship two times. The women's basketball team is also one of the best teams in the world, it won the World Championship of 1994 and with two players at the Hall of Fame, Hortencia and Magic Paula. In Venezuela and Uruguay, basketball is widely played too.
Volleyball.
Volleyball is very popular in Brazil, the male and female already won Olympic gold medals. The women's volleyball in Peru, already had a standout in the '80s, where they won a silver medal olympic. Today the sport is growing in Argentina and Venezuela.
Motorsports.
South America have several drivers who won the Formula One championship multiple times, including five-time champion Juan Fangio of Argentina, and Brazilian drivers Emerson Fittipaldi (2 titles), Nelson Piquet (3 titles), and Ayrton Senna (3 titles). Brazil has hosted the Brazilian Grand Prix every year since 1973 and Argentina has hosted Formula One on 21 occasions.
The Dakar Rally is also hosted by South America since 2009.
Baseball.
Baseball is the most popular sport in Venezuela. A wide list of players from Venezuela are in the major leagues in the United States. Venezuela is the only country in this region to participate in the World Baseball Classic and the Caribbean Series. In other countries like Colombia, baseball has been gaining popularity recently.
Rugby union.
Rugby union is becoming popular in South America, following the recent successes of Argentina in recent Rugby World Cup competitions. The popularity of the game has spread across the continent. Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, and Peru all have Rugby Federations.
Tennis.
South America has produced a number of talented tennis players such as four-time Grand Slam winner Guillermo Vilas, three-time French Open winner Gustavo Kuerten, US Open winner Gabriela Sabatini, French Open winners Gastón Gaudio and Andrés Gómez, 2009 US Open winner Juan Martín del Potro, and double Olympic Gold medalist Nicolás Massú. Marcelo Ríos was No. 1 in the ATP rankings.
Jai Alai.
Jai Alai or Basque pelota is played in many parts of South America.
Although this sport is mostly played in Spain and France, there are also federations of Basque ball in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Due to the origin of the game, there are many good players who are Basques, either natives or from the Basque diaspora.
Cricket.
Cricket is mostly played in the Southern Cone, especially in areas settled by English people.
Although a number of South American nations have teams, none of them are major, except for the Guyana national cricket team, which plays in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean. Guyana is also an independent nation represented by the West Indies cricket team, the only team in the Americas with Test status.

Duchy of Trakai

Duchy of Trakai was a subdivision of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the 14th and early 15th centuries. The Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke of Lithuania himself or his second-in-command.
History.
After the demise of Gediminas in December 1337, the Duchy of Lithuania was divided into two parts: Grand Duke Algirdas ruled Vilnius and the Eastern Aukštaitija while his brother Kęstutis received the Duchy of Trakai.
In 1382, during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384), Kęstutis was imprisoned at the Kreva Castle and died. His nephew Skirgaila was named the new Duke of Trakai by his brother Grand Duke Jogaila. Vytautas, son of Kęstutis, then waged the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) to regain his patrimony in Trakai and seize power in Lithuania. The war was ended by the Ostrów Agreement on August 4, 1392. The agreement transferred the Duchy from Skirgaila to Vytautas. 
On October 2, 1413, Vilnius and Trakai Voivodeships were created by the Union of Horodło from the Duchy of Trakai. The voivodeships were ruled by an appointed official and not by the dukes.
Geography.
One could delineate the boundaries of the Duchy of Trakai by referring to the donative writ of Grand Duke Jogaila: from the Livonian border (Upytл) to Kobrynin (Masuria), and eastward from Podlesie to Pinsk. Navahradak was still part of the Duchy of Trakai.

Gnoo Blas circuit

Gnoo Blas circuit was a motor racing circuit at Orange, New South Wales, Australia. The circuit was formed from rural roads and highways outside of the town, around the grounds of Bloomfield Hospital and what is now known as Sir Jack Brabham Park. It was 6.03 km long. The name came from the Aboriginal name for nearby Mount Canobolas.
The first race meeting was staged over the Anniversary Day holiday weekend of 24 to 26 January 1953 and was organized by the Australian Sporting Car Club, the former promoters of the Easter car races at the Mount Panorama Circuit, Bathurst. The circuit played a crucial part in the growth of Australian open wheel racing in the post war era but faded before the peak created by the Tasman Series.
Gnoo Blas also held the inaugural Australian Touring Car Championship event in 1960 which was won by David McKay driving a Jaguar Mark 1 3.4-litre. Also racing in the ATCC race that day were the likes of Bill Pitt (2nd), Ron Hodgson (3rd), Bruce McPhee, Des West, Ian Geoghegan and Brian Foley.
Continuing battles with New South Wales Police Force who authorised motor racing through the Speedway Act eventually forced the track's closure October 1961.
The locally based Gnoo Blas Classic Car Club hold an annual classic car show at the site.

Nitza Ben-Dov

Nitza Ben-Dov (, née Fruchtman, born 10 March 1950) is Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of Haifa.
Biography.
Nitza Ben-Dov was born in Tel Aviv to parents who were Holocaust survivors. Her father, Dov (Bernard) Fruchtman, was a teacher of literature and wrote a series of research studies on the oeuvre of S.Y. Agnon. Ben-Dov completed her secondary studies at the New High School (Tichon Hadash) in Tel Aviv in 1968. She served in the Israel Defense Forces (1968–1970) in the Nahal Brigade, at Nahal Golan.
Ben-Dov studied Hebrew Literature and Biblical Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem from 1970 to 1973 and received a teaching certificate in 1974. In 1974-1983, she did a Masters degree and doctorate at the University of California in Berkeley. Her doctoral dissertation was on dreams and psychology in the work of Agnon and Franz Kafka. She was an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1986 to 1989.
In 1989, she began to teach Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of Haifa, becoming a full professor in 1999. She has served as Editor-in-Chief of Haifa University Press/Zmora-Bitan (1996–2000) and as chair of the Academic TV channel (2001–2005).
Ben-Dov is married to Yosi Ben Dov, the principal and Managing Director of the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, and they have three children.
Research.
Ben-Dov has published books, articles, and essays on S. Y. Agnon, Abraham B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, S. Yizhar, Yehuda Amichai, Yehoshua Kenaz, Yehudit Handel, Haim Be'er, Sami Michael, Zeruya Shalev, Yehudit Rotem, and Dahlia Ravikovitch. Her research combines structuralist, feminist, psychoanalytical, and biographical elements in the work of these authors, along with intra-textual and inter-textual scrutiny.
Her book Agnon's Art of Indirection: Uncovering Latent Content in the Fiction of S.Y Agnon, published in 1993, revealed the possibility of analyzing Agnon's work (characterized by "the art of indirection", a term coined by Ben-Dov) even when translated into English. Ben-Dov has introduced Agnon to scholars of literature outside Israel and proved that it is possible to analyze word by word, through close reading, the unique nature of Agnon's work. Although the nuanced relations of the 'latent' and the 'uncovered' layers are attached through the essence of the Hebrew language, Ben-Dov illustrates that the greatness of a writer must withstand translation. The book surveys the methods, themes, and materials in Agnon's art, and deals extensively with dreams and their interpretation. It presents intersections of meaning in Agnon's writings, in which various layers are brought to light: psychoanalytical and cultural; a discussion is conducted on Biblical infrastructures, which the English reader may find in the translations of the works, in contrast to the Talmudic infrastructures.
The Hebrew book Unhappy/unapproved Loves: Erotic Frustration, Art and Death in the Work of Agnon (1997) enlarges the discussion of the Agnonian corpus and contains psychoanalytical discussions in the spirit of Freud and Jung; along with these are inter-textual discussions, both literary – as to the affinities between Agnon and Mann, Kafka, Voltaire, and Flaubert – and artistic-anthropological, on the affinity of the writings to the works of Rembrandt and Arnold Böcklin. The combination of methods constructs an autonomous cultural interpretation, which deciphers the Agnonian character, as well as the society out of which it arises. Common to the corpus under consideration is the theme of unfulfilled love and frustration that this invites. In this book Ben-Dov holds a dialogue with Agnon scholars and critics, and offers an original interpretation of his writing.
Her Hebrew book "And It Is Your Praise: Studies in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon, A. B. Yehoshua and Amos Oz" (2006) concerns particular, intra-textual research, mapping repetitive primary themes and literary formats in Agnon, Yehoshua, and Oz. It also conducts inter-textual research, singling out the tangential points of Yehoshua (to whom is devoted Ben-Dov's Hebrew book "In the Opposite Direction", 1995, about the novel Mr. Mani) and Oz on the one hand, and Agnon and the other: Agnon is a 'father figure' and the creator of literary models on which Oz and Yehoshua draw. In addition, the book indicates the unique elements in the works of Oz and Yehoshua after they lay down a mature fictional mode. The writings that Ben-Dov chose to discuss are timeless.
Her Hebrew-language book Written Lives: On Israeli Literary Autobiographies (Hayyim Ktuvim, 2011) is a scholarly response to the wave of autobiographic and biographic prose that has flooded Hebrew literature (and literature generally) since the early 1990s. Ben-Dov assigns Preliminaris by S. Yizhar, published in 1992, as the starting point of this salient trend in Israeli literature. In its wake came self-declared autobiographic novels: The Pure Element of Time (Havalim) by Haim Be'er (1998), A Tale of Love and Darkness (Sippur al ahava vehoshekh) by Amos Oz (2002), My Russian Grandmother and Her American Vacuum Cleaner (Ha-davar haya kakha) by Meir Shalev (2009), and Spanish Charity (Hessed sefaradi) by A.B. Yehoshua (2011). In Ben-Dov's discussion of Preliminaris and these others, she substantiates the two faces of this genre: a factual or semi-factual account tied in with a well designed written work. Ben-Dov likewise scrutinizes that dialectics of the later self-declared autobiographic work with earlier writings by these authors.
Ben-Dov studies autobiographic writings that preceded the torrent of late 20th and early 21st century: Agnon's story "The Mark" (Hasiman), the full version of which was published in 1962, the two semi-autobiographic novels by Sami Michael Refuge (Hasut) and A Handful of Fog (Hofen shel arafel), published in the late 1970s, and the complex of Dahlia Ravikovitch's prose and poetry, from which the experience of orphanhood erupts.
"Written Lives" also contains scholarly discussions of writings that are not purely literary, such as the "Baghdad Yesterday: The Making of an Arab Jew" (Bebagdad etmol), which is the memoirs of the literature scholar Sasson Somekh (2004); "Yosef Haim Brenner: A Biography" (Yosef Hayyim Brenner: Sippur hayyim) by the historian Anita Shapira (2008); and "Home" (Habayta), a novel of the kibbutz by Assaf Inbari (2009). "Written Lives" has a three-part Introduction and an Epilogue.

Julius Adolph Stöckhardt

Julius Adolph Stöckhardt (4 January 1809 – 1 June 1886) was a German agricultural chemist. He is mostly recognized for his work on fertilizers, fume damage of plants and his book "Die Schule der Chemie" ("School of Chemistry"), which was translated into 14 languages. His 500 lectures and over 500 publications helped to establish agricultural chemistry in Germany.
Life.
Stöckhardt was born in Röhrsdorf near Meißen on 4 January 1809 as son of a preacher. He was apprentice in a pharmacy from 1824 to 1828, studied at the University of Berlin, and obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig in 1837.
He worked at a mineral water factory from 1835 till he received a position at the Königlichen Gewerbeschule in Chemnitz (Royal Saxon Industrial School) in 1838. In 1846 he became a member of Dresden's scientific society ISIS, led by Ludwig Reichenbach.
From 1847 to 1883, Stöckhardt worked at the Königliche Forstakademie (Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry) in Tharandt, where a building was named after him. In 1866, he was elected Fellow of the Leopoldina.
He died in Tharandt on 1 June 1886 three years after he retired from the Forstakademie. One of his sons, Carl Georg Stöckhardt, emigrated to the United States and taught exegesis at the Concordia Seminary of the Lutheran Church St. Louis.
Work.
After the book of Justus von Liebig, "Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology" was published in 1840, Stöckhardt recognized the importance of fertilization for farmers and invested most of his time in popularizing scientific knowledge. In 1843 he started to give chemical lectures for farmers. In 1850 he and Hugo Schober started to publish the "Zeitschrift für deutsche Landwirthe" (Journal for German farmers). One year later, Germany's first large agricultural experiment station opened in Leipzig-Möckern, initiated by Stöckhardt.
His research on fertilizers was influenced by the work of Liebig, but Stöckhardt included nitrogen compounds into his fertilizers. Liebig denied the need to include nitrogen because it was available as gas from air. This conflict escalated into an academic fight between him and the "nitrogen advocates" which also ended the friendship between Stöckhardt and Liebig. Eventually, nitrogen containing fertilizers became a great success.
His research in fume damage on plants especially by industrial exhaust was ground breaking. He fumigated plants with known amount of several chemical compounds, for example sulfur dioxide, to detect the minimal concentration at which damages occurs. A "Commission for the detection of the damage caused by smelters" was introduced and the state parliament of Saxony also dealt with damage caused by smelters after his results were published.

<doc id="18558900" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18558900" title="Yale Cancer Center">
Yale Cancer Center

Yale Cancer Center (YCC) was founded in 1974 as a result of an act of Congress in 1971, which declared the nation's "war on cancer." It is one of a select network of 41 NCI-designated Cancer Centers throughout the country, designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the only one in southern New England. Directed by Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., MD, the Cancer Center brings together the resources of the Yale School of Medicine (YSM), Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), and Yale University.
Overview and History.
Over sixty years ago, the faculty at Yale School of Medicine pioneered the modern concepts of chemotherapy by administering the very first anticancer agent, nitrogen mustard, to a patient with cancer. Today, scientists and clinicians at Yale Cancer Center are collaborating to design and develop the latest cancer treatments and combination therapy to patients in Phase I, II, and III clinical trials.
Since the passage of the National Cancer Act in 1972, the NCI has mandated that comprehensive cancer centers, like Yale, develop fundamental basic science that translates into innovative therapies for cancer patients.
Cancer patients at Yale are able to directly access the most innovative therapies in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. The focus of the Center is to provide the highest quality clinical care by translating promising research discoveries from the laboratories into cutting-edge cancer treatments. This approach provides patients with early access to novel treatments that are not yet available in the community or at other cancer centers.
Clinical Care.
At Yale Cancer Center, science and medicine converge as the latest research is applied directly to patient care. Led by Roy S. Herbst, MD, Chief of Medical Oncology and Associate Director for Translational Research, Yale medical oncologists care for patients in Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven. To organize patient care, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital have developed 12 multidisciplinary programs to provide physicians and specialists at Yale Cancer Center with the opportunity to focus their expertise on specific types of cancers.
Clinical trials and research studies are available for appropriate patients with early or late-stage diseases who are under the care of the Center's oncology staff. Yale Cancer Center currently has 64 clinical trials available for patients in over 15 different disease areas.
Research.
Yale School of Medicine was home to the country’s first university-based Medical Oncology Section, and its faculty has since pioneered many breakthrough cancer treatments.
Basic research in cancer is a hallmark of Yale Cancer Center, which draws approximately $140 million in cancer research funding to Yale every year. Yale is home to some of the world’s leading investigators in cancer, who have provided a steady stream of advances in a number of disciplines, contributing to the basic understanding of cancer and to the development of new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.
The Developmental Therapeutics Research Program at Yale Cancer Center has been successful in discovering a wide range of novel agents, many of which are now undergoing pre-clinical and clinical testing. The newest initiative of the Developmental Therapeutics Program, a Phase I research team, specifically focuses on the application of promising laboratory discoveries in the design and conduct of clinical trials at Yale Cancer Center.

Blood of the Vikings

Blood of the Vikings was a 5 part 2001 BBC Television documentary series that traced the legacy of the Vikings in the British Isles through a genetics survey.
Production.
The series was presented by Julian Richards who has a long-held fascination with the Vikings.
Geneticist Professor David Goldstein, from University College London, lead the 15-month study that compared mouth swabs from 2,500 male volunteers from 25 different locations across the country with DNA samples from Scandinavian locals to find out how much Viking heritage remains in the UK.
The study traced the past movements of peoples to discover how many Vikings stayed after the raids. The study of history and archaeology alone could not answer this question. 
BBC Two Controller Jane Root described the station's work with UCL as a unique, nationwide project.
The research confirmed that the Vikings did not just raid and retreat to Scandinavia, but settled in Britain for years. They left their genetic pattern in some parts of the UK population. Concentrations of Norwegian genetic heritage were found in part of Cumbria in northwest England, the area around Penrith, the Shetland and Orkney Islands and the far north of the Scottish mainland.
In addition the research revealed surprising new information about Celtic and Anglo-Saxon heritage on the British mainland. Men who were tested in mainland Scotland had a percentage of Celtic genetic heritage similar to the population of southern England. This showed 1) that Celtic heritage persisted among men in southern England after Anglo-Saxon settlement; and 2) that the Scots were not predominantly Celtic.
The series included clips from Richard Fleischer’s 1958 film "The Vikings" starring Kirk Douglas to illustrate common modern attitudes towards the Vikings.

Medpedia

Medpedia was a collaborative project launched on 17 February 2009. Its aim was to create an open access online medical wiki encyclopedia in association with Harvard Medical School, Stanford School of Medicine, Berkeley School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medical School, the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) as well as other contributors. Content was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) license and ran on modified MediaWiki software. Harvard Medical School did not have a role in, nor is it responsible for, the content that appeared in the “wiki” section of Medpedia.
Anyone with medical knowledge was welcome to become part of Medpedia's community. However, to qualify to edit or contribute to the main content, approved editors must have an M.D., D.O., or Ph.D. in a biomedical field. Such editorial control policies appear to have been relatively successful in earlier established medical wikis directed towards a more technical audience such as Ganfyd. Others can contribute by writing in suggestions for changes to the site using the "Make a suggestion" link at the top of each page. An approved editor will review and potentially add submitted suggestions.
Medpedia was composed of three primary components:
A 2012 literature review of 50 academic journal articles about the use of social media by clinicians remarked that Medpedia had "launched in 2009 with substantial institutional backing" but that the authors "did not find articles reporting success metrics" for it.
About January 2013 the site abruptly closed with apparently very little attention. Medpedia’s founder James Currier acknowledged this was permanent in a Medical blog in July 2013
"Medpedia is now closed. Their facebook and twitter feeds may be still open but they have not been updated in a few years. Their webpage now goes to a spam site.

Nassef Sawiris received his secondary education in the German International School of Cairo, Egypt. Then he continued at University of Chicago where he received a bachelor's degree in Economics in 1982. 
He oversaw the construction activities of Orascom since 1990 and is the CEO of Orascom Construction Industries since the company's incorporation in 1998. He was also a board member of NASDAQ Dubai from July 2008 - June 2010 where his is still a board member, and currently sits on the boards of Besix (Belgium) and NNS Holding (Luxembourg), and is a director at Lafarge. In addition, he served on the Board of Directors of the Cairo & Alexandria Stock Exchanges from 2004 to 2007.
Nassef Sawiris, the youngest of three entrepreneurial brothers, runs Orascom Construction Industries, Egypt's most valuable publicly traded company. It was founded by their father, Onsi, in 1950. In September the company announced plans to invest $1.4 billion to build a nitrogen fertilizer plant in Iowa in order to supply corn belt farmers. Production is slated to start in 2015. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad called it the largest investment ever in the state; Orascom Construction Industries will receive a $100 million tax break. Last year, Sawiris hooked up with Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista's EBX Group to develop a nitrogen fertilizer plant in Brazil. Orascom Construction plans to split its fertilizer and construction divisions into two publicly traded companies by the end of 2012. Sawiris also owns big stakes in cement giant Lafarge and cement producer Texas Industries.

<doc id="18559066" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18559066" title="Disc coupling">
Disc coupling

Disc coupling: by definition, transmits torque from a driving to a driven bolt tangentially on a common bolt circle. Torque is transmitted between the bolts through a series of thin, stainless steel discs assembled in a pack. Misalignment is accomplished by deforming of the material between the bolts.
A disc coupling is a high performance motion control (Servo) coupling designed to be the torque transmitting element (by connecting two shafts together) while accommodating for shaft misalignment. It is designed to be flexible, while remaining torsionally strong under high torque loads. Typically, disc couplings can handle speeds up to 10,000 RPM.
There are two different styles of disc coupling:
The difference between the two styles is that single disc couplings cannot accommodate parallel misalignment due to the complex bending that would be required of the lone disc. Double disc styles allow the two discs to bend in opposite directions to better manage parallel offset. The discs are fastened to the hubs (and center spacer on double disc styles) with tight fitting pins that do not allow any play or backlash between the disc and the hubs. The discs can be bent easily and as a result, disc couplings have some of the lowest bearing loads available in a motion control coupling. 
Torsionally stiff and still flexible, disc couplings are a great solution for high speed applications. The downside is that they are more delicate than the average coupling and can be damaged if misused. Special care should be taken to ensure that misalignment is within the ratings of the coupling.

Art Renewal Center

The Art Renewal Center (ARC) is an organization led by New Jersey millionaire, businessman, and art collector Fred Ross dedicated to the promotion of what it terms classical realism in art, as opposed to the Modernist and Postmodernist developments that can be seen as early as the 1890s. ARC is a nonprofit educational foundation dedicated to the renewal of classical training and the re-appreciation of traditional art. They function mainly though their website, www.artrenewal.org. In addition to providing the public with art educational tools such as articles, artist biographies, podcasts, upcoming and current exhibition information, information on the atelier and academy schools where the atelier method is still taught and hosting a large online museum with over 75,000 images dedicated to traditional painting, they hold two competitions for living artists who paint in the realist tradition. The International ARC Salon is open to all artists who paint using realistic imagery, and their scholarship competition was formed to aid aspiring artists learn traditional training methods. They are large supporters of the Contemporary Realist Movement, which is founded with realist imagery, but with contemporary subject mater. They have a section titled Approved Artist and Living Master's Gallery, which shows the work of many contemporary realist artists of today, and includes several leaders of the movement.
History.
The Art Renewal Center (ARC) was founded in 2000 by a group of artists, art collectors, historians, and enthusiasts, and is chaired by Fred Ross. It is a visual arts organisation which advocates the rejection of Modernism and the current art establishment, in favour of what it defines as the previously established "standards of craftsmanship and excellence". The ARC sees the acquisition of academic skills as being essential for the art of the future. It operates primarily through a web site sponsored by Fred Ross, a millionaire New Jersey businessman and art collector, who is a strong campaigner for its ideas.
The web site examines values of art with articles, messages, and a detailed statement by Fred Ross, the ARC chairman. It is a campaigning site that is harshly critical of most modern art, and equally fervent about prior art. The site contains nearly 63,000 images of past works as examples of the art it endorses, as well as listing contemporary artists, schools and studios of which it approves. Particular emphasis is given to the work of French nineteenth-century Salon painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who is represented by over 226 images on the site; Ross says that Bouguereau's work is accessed twice as often as any other artist on the site, including such esteemed artists as Michelangelo.
Ross wrote in an essay:
Ross is a strong admirer of Bouguereau's work. In 2002 he spoke to the New York Society of Portrait Artists and described the impression made on him in the Clark Art Institute (Williamstown, Massachusetts) by Bouguereau's painting, "Nymphs and Satyr":
Images on the ARC site include many works of Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Romantic and French Academic art. It includes some Impressionist artists such as Claude Monet and Édouard Manet, but other than Vincent van Gogh, it does not include any of the Post-impressionists, such as Paul Gauguin or Paul Cézanne, nor any other Modernist school except the Surrealism exemplified by Salvador Dalí and Yves Tanguy. The group is critical of much twentieth-century art, arguing that it demonstrates weak technique and conveys ideas ineffectually, if at all, and focuses on false, obscure, or trivial subject matter, in addition to being weird for weirdness' sake. Exceptions include such twentieth-century artists as Maxfield Parrish, Norman Rockwell, and a number of contemporary realist painters featured in its Living Masters List.
The ARC says it abides by a concept of art exemplified by art produced from the Renaissance to the late nineteenth century. ARC's concept of art is defined by this quote from their FAQ:
The most recent famous modern artists to be discussed on their site are Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, and they are uniformly dismissed. Later postmodern artists are not mentioned.
The group actively promotes the French artist William-Adolphe Bouguereau, considering him not only the greatest French artist of the nineteenth century but also "unquestionably one of history's greatest artistic geniuses." Several Art Renewal Center members are, in addition, involved with the "William Bouguereau Catalog Raisonné" project.
The group is openly hostile to contemporary art education and dismissive of contemporary art history from the Impressionists onwards. Among the published polemics, there are attacks on David Hockney for his thesis that many artists used lenses and visual aids.
The Art Renewal Center also encourages the development of supposedly traditional painting styles and methods such as instruction by atelier for painters.
The ARC has received criticism even from some people with reservations about Modernism. Artist and blogger Mark Vallen posted on his web site that the ARC "are not incorrect when noting the follies of modern art, but their total rejection of it is beyond the pale and thoroughly reactionary." Vallen was also critical of Bouguereau: "Bouguereau's strength was his dedication to the craft of painting, and his technical mastery of oil painting can't be denied. If today's artists knew but a fraction of the painting skills possessed and employed by Bouguereau, they would be better off. Nevertheless, Bouguereau was also imprisoned by his extremely conservative vision of what painting could be—and that was his greatest weakness."
Online art museum.
The ARC has an online art gallery which contains thousands of images from classical painters across the world. Some images require visitors to sign up with an account on the ARC website in order to view them. Paid account members have access to high-resolution images of paintings .
Prizes.
The ARC runs a scholarship project and also an annual Salon competition since 2003. Dana E. Levin was one of the ARC International Scholarship winners in 2001 and 2002. Daniel Gerhartz won the Best in Show in 2004 Donato Giancola won first place in the figurative category in 2004.

Symphony No. 13 (Mozart)

Symphony No. 13 in F major, K. 112, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was written in Milan during the autumn of 1771. The symphony is in four movements, the second of which is scored for strings alone. The third movement minuet may have been written earlier, and then incorporated into the symphony—the autograph manuscript shows the minuet copied in Leopold's hand.

Heinrich Edmund Naumann

Heinrich Edmund Naumann (September 11, 1854 – February 1, 1927) was a German geologist, regarded as the “father of Japanese geology” in Meiji period Japan.
Biography.
Heinrich Edmund Naumann was hired by the Meiji government in 1875 as a foreign advisor, with the task of introducing the science of geology to Japan through his teaching at the "Kaisei Gakkō", the forerunner to Tokyo Imperial University.
Naumann arrived in Japan just one month before his twenty-fifth birthday, receiving a yearly salary of 3600 yen. Overall, he spent ten years in Japan, and wrote numerous scientific papers, most of which remain untranslated from the original German. During his early years in Japan, he both cooperated with, and competed against, fellow geologist John Milne. Both were part of the European scientific community interested in exploring the origins of the earth and the fledgling science of vulcanology. In 1877, Naumann and Milne investigated a volcanic eruption on the island of Izu Ōshima near Tokyo. However, by the 1880s, Milne focused more on seismology, whereas Naumann concentrated on his attempts to complete a geological map of the Japanese archipelago. 
Naumann conducted numerous geological surveys, traveling over 10,000 kilometers within Japan, covering almost every province in Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku. In 1879, Naumann began publishing his ideas of the geological origins of the Japanese archipelago, which he speculated was created from three major foldings of the Earth’s crust, in the pre-Paleozoic, late Paleozoic and Miocene era, and that Japan was composed of two major mountain systems, in the southwest and the northeast. The divide between these mountain systems, a great fault zone which vertically divides the main Japanese island of Honshū from the Izu peninsula in the southwest to Toyama in the northeast, he labeled the “Fossa Magna”. 
Per Naumann's suggestions, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce established a Geology Department in 1878, which began the process of systematically mapping the Japanese archipelago. The foundation of the Geological Survey of Japan came a year before the foundation of the equivalent United States Geological Survey in the United States.
Naumann was also interested in paleontology. In 1881, he published a paper on his findings with regards to the findings of fossilized bones remains of elephants in Japan. Elephants were known from the Tokugawa period through Buddhism and as samples brought by Dutch embassies, but were not previously known to have been native to Japan, so his findings received widespread popular publicity. One of the fossils Naumann examined from modern-day Tokyo proved to be a previously unknown extinct species, which was named in his honor: "Palaeoloxodon naumanni"). Other specimens were found at Lake Nojiri in Nagano Prefecture, and have later been discovered in Kyūshū.
Naumann did not actually excavate any fossils, but examined samples unearthed by Japanese and Western antiquarians, including samples excavated by Dr Edward S. Morse at the Omori shell mounds several years previously. The main significance of Naumann’s report was his placement of the fossils in the Pliocene era. Due to the quantity of fossils discovered (both of elephants and other animals as well as of plants), Naumann postulated that Japan was once connected to the Asian mainland via several land bridges through what is now the Korean Peninsula, the Kurile Islands and the Ryukyu islands, and that the climate at the time was tropical. This discovery, based by scientific evidence, that the Japanese archipelago was geologically an appendage to the Asian mainland, had geo-political implications which were not lost on the Meiji government, and geographical offices with often overlapping or conflicting jurisdictions were soon created within the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Home Minister, and Ministry of War.
Naumann’s years in Japan were eventful. Known for his quick temper, Naumann was known occasionally beating his students, and also came to blows with a subordinate, fellow German topographer, Otto Schmidt, whom he accused of having an affair with his wife. The brawl, which occurred in 1882, was highly public and was sensationalized in the foreign language newspapers in Japan. It resulted in Naumann’s arrest and trial before the German Consulate, at which he was fined 300 Marks (ℳ), but he was able to keep his position.
After his return to Germany, Naumann continued his work in geology, making important contributions to geological understanding of Anatolia and Mesopotamia. 
However, after his return to Germany, Naumann also made numerous public comments that were highly critical of Japanese modernization efforts, some of which were published in the "Allgemeine Zeitung" newspaper. Naumann argued that Japan was a dirty, impoverished and backward country, plagued by infectious diseases and barbarous customs. He lambasted the Japanese government for importing western culture and technologies indiscriminately, without any true understanding. Naumann stated that while there were many aspects of Japanese traditional culture that were admirable, the modern Japanese themselves had only contempt for their own history and traditions, and that this lack of respect for their own culture was a serious weakness. These statements were read by Mori Ogai, who was studying western medicine in Berlin at the time, leading to a heated newspaper debate. While Mori could easily refute some of Naumann’s statements regarding Japanese backwardness, he found it more difficult to refute Naumann’s criticism on Japanese westernization. On his return to Japan, Mori himself began to question and oppose efforts at shallow modernization and mimicry of all things Western, and to push for more respect for Japanese traditions. The arguments Naumann postulated were contemporary and similar with the writings of Japanese journalist Kuga Katsunan. 
The city of Itoigawa, Niigata in Japan opened a museum in Naumann’s honor in 1973.

<doc id="18559200" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18559200" title="Exhaled nitric oxide">
Exhaled nitric oxide

In medicine, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) can be measured in a breath test for asthma or other conditions characterized by airway inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule produced by certain cell types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FENO)is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma. The breath test has recently become available in many well-equipped hospitals in developed countries, although its exact role remains unclear.
Biology.
In humans, nitric oxide is produced from L-arginine by three enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS): inducible (iNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and neuronal (nNOS). The latter two are constantly active in endothelial cells and neurons respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by cytokines). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including eosinophils. As such, eNO has been dubbed an "inflammometer".
Although iNOS is thought to be the main contributor to exhaled NO in asthmatics, studies in mice also point to a role for nNOS.
It was initially thought that exhaled NO derived mostly from the sinuses, which contain high levels of NO. It has subsequently been shown that the lower airways contribute most of the exhaled NO, and that contamination from the sinuses is minimal.
Medical use.
Asthma.
Patients with asthma have higher eNO levels than other people. Their levels also rise together with other clinical and laboratory parameters of asthma (for example, the amount of eosinophils in their sputum). In conditions that trigger inflammation such as upper respiratory tract infections or the inhalation of allergens or plicatic acid, eNO levels rise. The eNO levels also tend to vary according to the results of lung function test results such as the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, drugs used to treat asthma (such as inhaled glucocorticoids or leukotriene receptor antagonists) also reduce eNO levels.
Clinical trials have looked at whether tailoring asthma therapy based on eNO values is better than conventional care, in which therapy is gauged by symptoms and the results of lung function tests. To date, the results in both adults and children have been modest and this technique can not be universally recommended. It has also been noted that factors other than inflammation can increase eNO levels, for example airway acidity.
The fraction of eNO has been found to be a better test to identify asthmatics than basic lung function testing (for airway obstruction). Its specificity is comparable to bronchial challenge testing, although less sensitive. This means that eNO might not be as useful to rule in a diagnosis of asthma as it might be useful to rule it out.
Other conditions.
The role for eNO in other conditions is even less well established compared to asthma.
Since asthma can be a cause of chronic coughing (it may even be the sole manifestation, such as in cough-variant asthma), studies have looked at whether eNO can be used in the diagnosis of chronic cough.
Exhaled NO is minimally increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but levels may rise in sudden worsenings of the disease (acute exacerbations) or disease progression. Early findings indicate a possible role for eNO in predicting the response to inhaled glucocorticoids and the degree of airway obstruction reversibility.
Children with cystic fibrosis have been found to have low eNO levels. In subjects with bronchiectasis (a state of localized, irreversible dilatation of part of the bronchial tree) not due to cystic fibrosis, high levels have been found. Sarcoidosis could also feature increased eNO. Low levels have been found in primary ciliary dyskinesia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the latter condition, "inhaled" NO is used as a diagnostic test of the response of the pulmonary arteries to vasodilators (agents that relax the blood vessels).
Exposure to air pollution has been associated with decreased, and increased eNO levels.
Measurement techniques.
The most widely used technique to measure eNO is with a chemical reaction that produces light; this is called a chemiluminescence reaction. The NO in the breath sample reacts with ozone to form nitrogen dioxide in an excited state. When this returns to its ground state, it emits light in quantities that are proportional to the amount of exhaled NO.
The subject can exhale directly into a measurement device ('online' technique), or into a reservoir that can afterwards be connected to the analyser ('offline' technique). With the former technique, the early and later NO in the breath sample can be analysed separately. The test requires little coordination from the subject, and children older than 4 can be tested successfully.
Aerocrine, a Swedish developer and seller of biomedical equipment, has patented a device call NIOX MINO that appears to measure NO levels with strong agreement in values with chemiluminescence. However, the patents are void of any detail regarding the operating principles behind the device or any evidence that the signal generated is due to nitric oxide.
Reference range.
The upper normal level of eNO in different studies ranges from 20 to 30 parts per billion. However, several major features influence the reference values. Men have higher eNO values than women. Smoking notoriously lowers eNO values, and even former smoking status can influence results. The levels are higher in people with an atopic constitution (a tendency towards allergies). The fraction of eNO is also flow-dependent (higher at lower flow rates and vice versa), so measurements are normally measured at 50 ml/s. Age or height could also considerably confound eNO values in children. The magnitude of these effects lies in the order of 10%, so even single cut-off values might be useful.
History.
Until the 1980s, nitric oxide, a product of fossil fuel combustion, was thought only to play a role the detrimental effects of air pollution on the respiratory tract. In 1987, experiments with coronary arteries showed that nitric oxide was the long sought endothelium-derived relaxing factor. After scientists realised that NO played a biological role, its role as a cell signalling molecule and neurotransmitter became clear from abundant studies.
NO was first detected in exhaled breath samples in 1991. In 1992, NO was voted molecule of the year by the scientific journal "Science". In 1993, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden were the first to report increased eNO in asthmatics.
Today, NO is not only used in breath tests but also as a therapeutic agent for conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and possibly for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Edwin Corle

Edwin Corle (May 7, 1906 – June 11, 1956) was an American writer.
Biography.
He was born in Wildwood, New Jersey and educated at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his A.B. in 1928. For the next two years he was a graduate student at Yale University.
In 1932 he married Helen Freeman in Ensenada, Mexico.
He served in World War II, and in 1944 married Jean Armstrong. His prolific writing career led to a final residence at Hope Ranch, Santa Barbara where he died on June 11, 1956.
Writing.
His writing is noted for realistic portrayals of Native American life in the early 20th century. After a brief stint at writing for radio, Corle began writing numerous short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines. In 1934 his "Mojave: A Book Of Stories" was published. This was followed a year later by his first and most successful novel, "Fig Tree John", based on a Cahuilla Indian from southern California. In addition to other novels, Corle also wrote non-fiction, including books on the Grand Canyon and the Gila River. His sophisticated interest in the arts is reflected in his works on Igor Stravinsky and the artist Merle Armitage. In the 1950s, Corle began what was to be his most important effort, a multi-volume novel called "The Californians". The work was left uncompleted upon his death and is included in his extensive papers, letters and manuscripts donated by Ralph B. Sipper of Santa Barbara to Indiana University in 1997. Another important collection of his papers, including correspondence with Lawrence Clark Powell, is in the Special Collections of UCLA.
Legacy.
For many years the Library of the University of California at Santa Barbara has sponsored an Edwin and Jean Corle Lecture Series.

<doc id="18559216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18559216" title="Russula brevipes">
Russula brevipes

Russula brevipes is a species of mushroom commonly known as the short-stemmed russula or the stubby brittlegill. It is edible, although its quality is improved once parasitised by the ascomycete fungus "Hypomyces lactifluorum", transforming it into an edible known as a lobster mushroom.
Taxonomy.
"Russula brevipes" was initially described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1890. It is classified in the subsection "Lactaroideae", a grouping of similar "Russula" species characterized by having whitish to pale yellow fruit bodies, compact and hard flesh, abundant lamellulae (short gills), and the absence of clamp connections. Other related "Russula" species with a similar range of spore ornamentation heights include "Russula delica", "R. romagnesiana", and "R. pseudodelica".
There has been considerable confusion in the literature over the naming of "Russula brevipes". Some early 20th-century American mycologists referred to it as "Russula delica", although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Magnus Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named "Russula delica". Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: "Russula delica" is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the evidence indicates that "R. delica" sensu Fries (1838) is not "R. delica" sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not "R. delica" sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…  It is best to use "R. brevipes" for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call "R. delica". The name, "R. brevipes", is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.
The specific epithet is derived from the Latin "brevis" "short" and "pes" "foot", hence "short-footed". Common names used to refer to the mushroom include "short-stemmed russula" and "stubby brittlegill".
Description.
Fully grown, the cap can range from 7 to 30 cm (3–12 in) in diameter, whitish to dull-yellow in color, and is funnel-shaped with a central depression. The gills are narrow and thin, decurrent in attachment, nearly white when young but becoming pale yellow to buff in age, and sometimes forked near the stipe. The stipe is 3–8 cm long, 2.5–4 cm thick, white in color but with yellowish-brownish discolorations in age. The spore print is white to light cream in color. Spores are egg-shaped to more or less spherical, and measure 7.5–10 by 6.5–8.5 µm; they have a partially reticulate (network-like) surface dotted with warts measuring up to 1 µm high.
The variant "R. brevipes" var "acrior" Shaffer has a subtle green shading at the stipe apex and on the gills.
Similar species.
The subalpine waxy cap ("Hygrophorus subalpinus") is somewhat similar in appearance to "R. brevipes" but lacks its brittle flesh, and it has a sticky, glutinous cap. The Pacific Northwest species "Russula cascadensis" also resembles "R. brevipes", but has an acrid taste. Another lookalike, "R. vesicatoria", has gills that often fork near the stipe attachment.
Distribution and habitat.
It is a common ectomycorrhizal fungus associated with several hosts across temperate forest ecosystems. Recently, it has been reported in Pakistan's Himalayan moist temperate forests associated with "Pinus wallichiana".
Edibility.
"Russula brevipes" is a non-descript edible species that tends to assume the flavors of meats and sauces it is cooked with. It is one of several "Russula" species harvested in the wild from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in local markets in nearby Ozumba. The mushroom is commonly parasitized by the parasitic ascomycete "Hypomyces lactifluorum", transforming it into an edible known as a lobster mushroom.
Bioactive compounds.
The sesquiterpene lactone named russulactarorufin along with lactarorufin-A and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,22"E"-diene-3β,5α,6β-triol have been isolated and characterized from this species.

<doc id="18559221" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18559221" title="Project AGILE">
Project AGILE

Project AGILE was an ARPA project in the 1960s that investigated means for engaging in remote, limited warfare of an asymmetric type. The research was intended for use in providing U.S. support to countries engaged in fighting Communist insurgents, particularly in Vietnam and Thailand.
History.
Project AGILE was directed by the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration, or ARPA, and ran from mid 1961 through 1974, when it was canceled. The project was charged with developing methods to use in the looming Vietnam War, and also provided information for use by Thailand in counterinsurgency action against Communist rebels.
Coverage.
Project AGILE covered a wide range of topics related to warfare under various conditions present in the Far East, from electronic surveillance, used to interdict Communist convoys in the Ho Chi Minh trail, to sociological research on troops likely to be subverted by Communist rebels. It was broken down into a number of subprojects.
Subproject I, II, and VIII.
Subprojects II and VIII were merged into Subproject I, and the resulting subproject covered weapons, individual equipment, and rations. Individual weapons included the M16 assault rifle, special purpose shotguns for use as insurgency weapons, flamethrowers, and rifle grenades. Crew served weapons included cupolas for armored personnel carriers, quad-mount machine guns, squeeze bore .50 to .30 caliber guns, multiple shot grenade launchers, lightweight mortars, and the Stoner 63 weapons system.
Subproject III.
Subproject III covered remote area mobility and logistics. Included were studies of air and land transport, amphibious and water transport, STOL aircraft, and remote airstrips.
Subproject IV.
Subproject IV covered communications systems. Both technical and procedural aspects of radio communications were studied, as well as power supplies and antennas.
Subproject V.
Subproject V covered combat surveillance and target acquisition. Included were studies of airborne systems, such as infrared, radar, light amplification and spectral zone photography; surface use systems such as night vision, personal Doppler radar, target illumination, metal and cavity detectors; security and navigation systems.
Subproject VI.
Subproject VI covered "individual and special projects", which included use of herbicides (such as Agent Orange), psychological warfare, and medical research and equipment. The use of herbicides was largely inspired by the British use of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T (Agent Orange) to destroy jungle-grown crops during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. 
OCONUS and CONUS Test Programs.
Part of Project AGILE was Subproject VI and the OCONUS (Outside the CONtinental US) DEFOLIATION TEST PROGRAM was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Project Agile, ARPA Order 423. Conducted by the United States Army Biological Center which was based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, one test program was conducted in Thailand in 1964 and 1965 to determine the effectiveness of aerial applications of Purple, Orange, and other candidate chemical agents in defoliation of upland jungle vegetation representative of Southeast Asia. Data provided by these techniques were used in comparative evaluation of defoliant chemicals in relation to rate, volume, season of application, canopy penetration, and vegetation response.
There have been recurring allegations that similar tests have been conducted in Okinawa. "Japan Times" and "Okinawa Times" published accounts from an unnamed official claiming that "Pentagon had tested defoliants in the island’s northern jungles near Kunigami and Higashi villages." Other corroborating evidence is that in 1962, the U.S. Army counterinsurgency school in Vietnam moved to Okinawa. The USNS Schuyler Otis Bland (T-AK-277) was known to have brought highly classified "agriculture products" under armed guard to southeast Asia, Okinawa, and Panama. The ship’s logbook was found by Michelle Gatz and shows the ship was carrying classified cargo that was offloaded under armed guard at White Beach a U.S. Navy port on Okinawa’s east coast on April 25, 1962. After departing Okinawa in spring 1962, the Bland sailed to the Panama Canal Zone where, the Panamanian government asserts, the U.S. tested herbicides in the early 1960s. In June 2013, the US DoD rejected the allegations that Agent Orange being present on Okinawa, saying they had no factual basis. For example, according to the DoD report, the S.O. Bland was loaded with Agent Pink and Agent Purple, which it off loaded to Vietnam on 16–18 January 1962 "before" it stopped at Okinawa on 31 January 1962 on its way back.
The late author Sheldon H. Harris in his book "Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932-1945, and the American cover up" wrote that field tests for wheat rust and rice blast were conducted throughout 1961 in Okinawa and at "at several sites in the midwest and south", although these were probably part of Project 112. Harris attributes the rapid expansion of the US defoliant programs to these early successes.
Subproject VII.
Subproject VII covered technical planning and programming, including research into morbidity and casualties, environmental issues, and various tactical studies, both of Viet Cong operations, and other instances of asymmetric warfare, such as conflicts in Algeria and Latin America.

Kadarim (, "lit." Potters) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located near Maghar, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. 
The village was established in 1980 near Mount Kadarim, which was named after the potters of the village of Hananiah, famous for its pottery during the time of the Talmud and the Mishnah. Due to its proximity to a quarry at its initial site, the kibbutz was moved to its current location in 1987.
Some believe that Habakkuk is buried near Kadarim, though others put his burial place near Hokuk or at Toyserkan in Iran

Ethidium homodimer assay

An ethidium homodimer assay can be used to detect dead or dying cells. Ethidium homodimer is a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye which binds to DNA. After a cell sample has been stained with ethidium homodimer, the dead cells may be viewed and counted under a UV-light microscope. 
When cells die, the plasma membranes of those cells becomes disrupted. Because of this, ethidium homodimer may enter those cells and bind to DNA within those cells. Because live cells don't have a compromised membrane, the ethidium homodimer can't enter. 
One reason for doing an ethidium homodimer assay instead of using a TUNEL assay to measure cell death is that ethidium homodimer stains all of the dead or dying cells, while TUNEL only stains cells that have undergone programmed cell death.

Ksplice

Ksplice is a free software extension of the Linux kernel which allows system administrators to apply security patches to a running kernel without having to reboot the operating system (a technique broadly referred to as Dynamic Software Updating). It only supports patches that do not make significant semantic changes to kernel data structures.
Ksplice has been implemented for Linux on the x86-32 and x86-64 architectures. It was developed by Ksplice, Inc. until 21 July 2011, when Oracle acquired Ksplice and started offering support for Oracle Linux. Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux was dropped and turned into a free 30-day trial for RHEL customers as an incentive to migrate to Oracle Linux Premier Support.
Design.
Ksplice takes as input a unified diff and the original kernel source code, and it updates the running kernel in memory. Using Ksplice does not require any preparation before the system is originally booted, (the running kernel needs no special prior compiling, for example). In order to generate an update, Ksplice must determine what code within the kernel has been changed by the source code patch. Ksplice performs this analysis at the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) object code layer, rather than at the C source code layer.
To apply a patch, Ksplice first freezes execution of a computer so it is the only program running. The system verifies that no processors were in the middle of executing functions that will be modified by the patch. Ksplice modifies the beginning of changed functions so that they instead point to new, updated versions of those functions, and modifies data and structures in memory that need to be changed. Finally, Ksplice resumes each processor running where it left off.
To be fully automatic, Ksplice's design was originally limited to patches that did not introduce semantic changes to data structures, since most Linux kernel security patches do not make these kinds of changes. An evaluation against Linux kernel security patches from May 2005 to May 2008 found that Ksplice was able to apply fixes for all the 64 significant kernel vulnerabilities discovered in that interval. In 2009, major Linux vendors asked their customers to install a kernel update more than once per month.
For patches that do introduce semantic changes to data structures, Ksplice requires a programmer to write a short amount of additional code to help apply the patch.
This was necessary for 12% of the updates in that time period.
History.
The Ksplice software was created by four MIT students based on Jeff Arnold's master's thesis. Jeff Arnold later created Ksplice, Inc. with himself as the president of the company. Around May 2009, the company won the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition and the Cyber Security Challenge of Global Security Challenge.
Whereas the Ksplice software was provided under an open source license, Ksplice, Inc. provided a service to make it easier to use the software. Ksplice, Inc. provided prebuilt and tested updates for the Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora Linux distributions. The virtualization technologies OpenVZ and Virtuozzo were also supported. Updates for Ubuntu Desktop and Fedora systems were provided free of charge, whereas other platforms were offered on a subscription basis.
On 21 July 2011, Oracle announced they acquired Ksplice, Inc. At the time the company was acquired, Ksplice, Inc. claimed to have over 700 companies using the service to protect over 100,000 servers. While the service had been available for multiple Linux distributions, it was stated at the time of acquisition that "Oracle believes it will be the only enterprise Linux provider that can offer zero downtime updates." More explicitly, "Oracle does not plan to support the use of Ksplice technology with Red Hat Enterprise Linux." Existing legacy customers continue to be supported by Ksplice, but no new customers are being accepted for other platforms.

The effect was to slow development, and farmland loss, but when prices rose for land the farms were still sold for profit. The act was supplemented with the Agriculture Retention and Development Act of 1981 which put permanent deed restrictions on the sale of farm properties. The Farmland Assessment Act continues today allowing tax exemptions for property 5 acres or more in size devoted to farmland or woodland.

Howard Stelzer

Howard Stelzer (born 1974, in Belle Harbor, New York) is a composer of electronic music, whose work is made primarily from sounds generated by cassette tapes and tape players. In 1997, he founded the independent record label Intransitive Recordings, through which he published CDs and records of experimental music by artists such as Brume, Jason Lescalleet, John Hudak, Kyle Bobby Dunn, Nerve Net Noise, nmperign, Jim Haynes, Brendan Murray, Seht, Lethe, Kapotte Muziek, Lionel Marchetti, Roel Meelkop, C. Spencer Yeh, and many others.
Early Years.
Stelzer grew up on Long Island, NY, before moving with his family to Boca Raton, FL when he was 12 years old. While in high school, Stelzer began making crude noise collages with cassette tapes and a simple home stereo system. His first concerts consisted of playing back these tapes while striking metal percussion instruments made from car parts and sheet metal scavenged from junk yards. After a few small-edition cassette tapes distributed for free to friends, Stelzer published his debut album, "Stone Blind", as a CD on his own Intransitive Recordings label in 1997. The album consisted of three related pieces, each roughly 20 minutes long, and made out of crudely spliced cassette tapes. Each track was recorded in a single take to one side of a 40-minute tape; a piece ended when the tape ran out. 
After completing an undergraduate degree in English at the University of Florida in Gainesville in 1998, Stelzer moved to Boston, Massachusetts. In his new city, Stelzer came into contact with musicians working in the free improvisation idiom, such as nmperign, David Gross, and Vic Rawlings, and began using his cassette tapes as instruments for improvised collaborative performances.
Stelzer & Talbot.
From 2000 until 2004, Stelzer performed in a duo with turntablist Jason Talbot. Their music was entirely improvised, though they attempted to create a sound the resembled studio-composed spliced tape. The duo toured extensively, performing at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in the Netherlands in 2003, Heaven Gallery in Chicago, Tonic in New York City, and around the US and Canada.
Compositions.
After 2004, Stelzer performed less frequently, and concentrated instead on solo compositions and studio collaborations. One of these was Exactly What You Lost, a long-distance collaboration with New Zealand artist Stephen Clover, aka Seht. Stelzer's other collaborators have included Frans de Waard (Kapotte Muziek), Jazzkammer, Emil Beaulieau, Giuseppe Ielasi, Peter Wright, Antony Milton, nmperign, The Cherry Point, Jason Lescalleet, Joseph Hammer, Will Guthrie, Otomo Yoshihide, Jessica Rylan, Sawako, Ben Hall, AMK, John Olson (of Wolf Eyes), Skeletons Out (a duo with turntable and harmonium player Jay Sullivan) and Ouest (a trio with Sullivan and Brendan Murray).

Gameplay.
Flash Columns.
Based on the game mode in the original "Columns" game. The player has to rearrange falling columns of gems to connect four matching shapes in order to make them disappear. To clear the level, players must clear all the flashing gems in the level. The game is over when the gems reach the top of the screen.
Penalty Shootout.
A soccer game based on taking penalties. When shooting the penalties, the player can select how to swerve the ball and how high to kick it at the goal. When playing as the goalkeeper against the computer, the player must save penalties by guessing where the shot will be placed. To clear the level, the player must score more penalties than the computer.
Tennis.
A basic tennis game, with players facing increasingly harder opponents. Sonic the Hedgehog makes a cameo appearance as the umpire.
Rally.
An arcade-style racing game with five levels. The player must avoid other racers and reach checkpoints to stay in the race. The game ends when the timer runs out.

The Marquess of Pombal Square () is an important roundabout in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. It is located between the Avenida da Liberdade (Liberty Avenue) and the Eduardo VII Park.
The square is the radiating point for various important avenues: Liberdade, Duque de Loulé and Fontes Pereira de Melo, as well as the streets Braamcamp and Joaquim António de Aguiar.
Its name is a reference to Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal, 1st Count of Oeiras, the mighty prime-minister who ruled Portugal from 1750 to 1777. In the middle of the roundabout there is a large column dedicated to him, built between 1917 and 1934 and created by Adães Bermudes, António Couto and Francisco Santos. A bronze statue of the Marquess is on the top, with a lion - symbol of power - by his side. The Marquis is shown looking towards the "Baixa Pombalina", the area of Lisbon that was rebuilt under his direction after the disastrous 1755 Lisbon Earthquake.
The Blue and Yellow lines ("Linha Azul" and "Linha Amarela") of the Lisbon Metro ("Metropolitano de Lisboa") stop at Marquês de Pombal station, which was called Rotunda until March 1998. Eighteen bus lines operated by Carris also serve the square.

USS "Manchineel" (AN-54/YN-73) was an which served with the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific Ocean during World War II. She managed to survive the war without incident, and returned to the United States post-war for decommissioning.
Launched at Stockton, California.
"YN 73", originally named "Sumac", was renamed "Manchineel" 3 April 1943; laid down 8 June 1943 by Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Company, Stockton, California; launched 1 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Warren Atherton; redesignated "AN-54" 20 January 1944; and commissioned 26 April 1944, Lt. William B. Brown, USNR, in command.
World War II service.
South Pacific operations.
Following shakedown off San Pedro, California, "Manchineel" departed 22 June for the South Pacific Ocean, arriving Pearl Harbor 1 July. She operated off Pearl Harbor until 5 September when she sailed for the Marshall Islands, arriving at Majuro Atoll the 15th. After removing the nets around the atoll, "Manchineel" continued on to Kwajalein 22 September, arriving 4 days later for net tending duties until 20 May 1945.
The net laying ship then steamed for the Gilbert Islands, arriving Tarawa 23 May to pick up six pontoon barges for tow to Majuro. The trip took 6 long days of retrieving and dragging the water filled pontoons. "Manchineel" returned to Kwajalein 2 June to resume net operations.
Except for a week at Eniwetok in July, "Manchineel" remained in the Kwajalein area through the announcement of Japan’s surrender 15 August. 
Post-war decommissioning.
On 10 October the ship departed for the U.S. West Coast via Pearl Harbor, arriving San Francisco, California, 3 November for mooring duty.
"Manchineel" decommissioned 11 March 1946, was stripped at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and was struck from the Navy list 12 April. On 18 June 1947 "Manchineel" was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission and delivered to Walter H. Wilms following sale 2 days earlier.

Riverside County Office of Education

The Riverside County Office of Education (RCOE):) serves as an intermediary between the California Department of Education and local school districts. The office provides a wide range of educational and administrative support services to the 23 school districts and the more than 423,000 students living in Riverside County.
The Riverside County Office of Education has three components: the elected County Superintendent of Schools, who serves a four-year term of office; the seven elected members of the County Board of Education, who also serve four-year terms of office; and the entire body of employees in the organization, all of whom are employed directly by the County Superintendent.
RCOE has been serving students throughout Riverside County for more than 115 years. With well over 420,000 students, RCOE is California’s fourth largest county office of education. There are 23 school districts in Riverside County. These districts vary in size from Desert Center, which serves just over a handful of students, to Corona-Norco, with more than 50,000 students.
County offices serve three legally mandated functions. The first is to meet the needs of those students who are outside of the educational programs and services of their local school districts. The second is to work with the local school districts to ensure they are providing students with the best educational programs and services possible and remaining financially solvent in the process. And third is the role of the Board of Education, which is primarily a policy and appellate role. Two other significant roles played by county offices are recognizing student achievement and educator excellence, and providing county-wide educational events that promote a focus on the success of all students.
At RCOE, approximately 1,900 employees work in one of six service divisions and the Office of the Superintendent. The six divisions are: the Division of Administration and Business Services, the Division of Educational Leadership Services, the Division of Personnel Services, the Division of Student Programs and Services, the Division of Educational Services, and the Division of Children and Family Services. Because the county is so extensive, both regional offices (located in Murrieta and Indio) are staffed with employees from a number of these divisions.
History.
On March 11, 1893, California Governor Henry Markham signed the bill that took from San Diego and San Bernardino counties – which were in disagreement over many issues – to form the new County of Riverside.
San Timoteo Canyon Schoolhouse, built as an adobe building in 1856, is distinguished as the first school in the territory that became Riverside County. The original schoolhouse accommodated 25 to 40 students from grades one to eight and served the pioneer families as well as the temporary students of work crews on the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Well-documented history of Riverside County schools begins with the establishment of the county and consequent appointment of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools Lyman Gregory on May 9, 1893. Gregory’s office in 1893 was located in the original courthouse on the corner of Eighth and Lime streets in downtown Riverside. During the time of Edward Hyatt (1903), a new County Courthouse on Main Street was built. At that time, the superintendency remained an elected position, but the office was part of county government until it gained fiscal independence in 1975.
The Riverside County Office of Education has grown to nearly 2,000 employees working at offices in Riverside, Murrieta and Indio and with a budget of $257 million.
With the appointment of Kenneth M. Young as the 11th Riverside County Superintendent of Schools, enrollment in Riverside County schools has surpassed more than 400,000 students at 434 sites under the jurisdiction of 23 local school districts. There are more than 36,000 teachers and other school employees working in Riverside County.

Hermanus Christoffel Beukes (also known as Oom Maans Beukes) (born 20 June 1913 in Rehoboth, German South West Africa - died 22 July 2004 in Rehoboth, Namibia) was a Coloured Namibian politician and activist. Beukes was a frequent petitioner of the United Nations because of Apartheid South Africa's actions while Namibia was held under its mandate.
Abduction.
Beukes was in a group of Namibians who fled to neighboring Botswana in 1963. Alongside Kenneth Abrahams, Andreas Shipanga and fellow Baster Paul Smit, the group fled the country because of their actions in recruiting soldiers for SWAPO's military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia. South African agents in Botswana abducted the foursome and returned them to Namibia. Following international pressure regarding the illegality of state-sponsored kidnapping, South Africa returned the four to Botswana. Intending to travel to New York City to petition the United Nations for Namibia in person, Beukes could not adjust to the changed environment and returned to Rehoboth. In Rehoboth, Beukes was a shoemaker.

Edmund Ffoulkes

Edmund Salisbury Ffoulkes (1819 or 1820 – 19 April 1894) was a British clergyman who converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism and back again in the 19th century.
Biography.
Ffoulkes was educated at Shrewsbury School and Jesus College, Oxford. His uncle, Henry Foulkes was principal of the college from 1817 to 1857. He obtained a second-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1841. He became a Fellow of Jesus College in 1843, holding this position until 1855. He was ordained as a priest in the Church of England and also served for a time as the college's Junior Bursar. He joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1855. However, after fifteen years in the Catholic Church, he applied to his Bishop, Samuel Wilberforce, to be reinstated as a clergyman in the Church of England, and his request was granted. Jesus College appointed him as rector of Wigginton, Oxfordshire in 1876. When the position of vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford became vacant in 1878, no Fellow of Oriel College wished to accept the appointment and the position was then offered to Ffoulkes, who had previously assisted at services.
Ffoulkes wrote several theological works, including "Christendom's Divisions", "The Church's Creed or the Crown's Creed", and "The Primitive Consecration of the Eucharistic Oblation". His final work was "The History of St. Mary the Virgin". He also lectured in Divinity to the non-collegiate students at Oxford.

St. George's Monastery (Wadi Qelt)

St. George Orthodox Monastery, or Monastery of St. George of Koziba is a monastery located in Wadi Qelt, in the eastern West Bank. The sixth-century cliff-hanging complex, with its ancient chapel and gardens, is active and inhabited by Greek Orthodox monks. It is reached by a pedestrian bridge across the Wadi Qelt, which many imagine to be Psalm 23's Valley of the Shadow. The valley parallels the old Roman road to Jericho, the backdrop for the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37). The monastery is open to pilgrims and visitors.
History.
St. George's Monastery began in the fourth century with a few monks who sought the desert experiences of the prophets, and settled around a cave where they believed Elijah was fed by ravens (1 Kings 17:5-6). 
This Greek Orthodox monastery was built in the late 5th century A.D. by John of Thebes. He became a hermit and moved from Egypt to Syria Palaestina in 480 A.D. The monastery was named St. George after the most famous monk who lived at the site – Gorgias of Coziba. Destroyed in 614 A.D. by the Persians, the monastery was more or less abandoned after the Persians swept through the valley and massacred the fourteen monks who dwelt there. The Crusaders made some attempts at restoration in 1179. However, it fell into disuse after their expulsion. In 1878, a Greek monk, Kalinikos, settled here and restored the monastery, finishing it in 1901. The traditions attached to the monastery include a visit by Elijah en route to the Sinai Peninsula, and St. Joachim, whose wife Anne was infertile, weeping here when an angel announced to him the news of Mary's conception. The bones and skulls of the martyred monks killed by the Persians in 614 A.D. can still be seen today in the monastery chapel.
Today.
The monastery is located 20 km/12.5 mi from Jerusalem on the road to Jericho. There is a sign posted to the monastery, which goes off on the left from the rather higher north side which there is the first view of the gorge of the Wadi Qelt. From the parking lot there is a path only suitable for all-terrain vehicles which runs northeast (about 1.25 hours on foot) to a hill with a cross, from which there is a view of the Greek Orthodox monastery of St. George and far to the left, a rivulet flowing down the hillside from a spring, from which water is channeled to the monastery. The stony track continues (another half-hour's walk), to the entrance to the monastery, which clings precariously to the sheer north face of the gorge.

French Australian

French Australians () are Australian citizens who are of French ancestry or France-born people who reside in Australia. According to the 2011 Census, there were 110,399 people of French descent in Australia and 24,675 France-born people residing in the country at the moment of the census, having an increase of 28.6 per cent compared to the 2006 Census. The largest French Australian community is in the state of New South Wales, with 8,936 France-born people.
Demography.
According to the 2006 Australian census, 98,332 Australians (or 0.47% of the population) claim French ancestry, either alone or with another ancestry. Of these, 19,186 were born in France and 12,735 of them had since acquired Australian citizenship.
8,281 (or 43%) of the residents born in France had arrived in Australia in 1979 or earlier.
History.
France's connection with Australia began early, with Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, Jules Dumont d'Urville, Nicolas Baudin, François Péron and Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne being some of the first European explorers to reach the continent. Furthermore, British-born navigator Tobias Furneaux was a descendant of the nobles who sailed with the William the Conqueror, when they invaded England from France in 1066. Today, many prominent places in Australia bear the names of these explorers such as the Furneaux Museum in Tasmania. 
Many Australians with French ancestry are descended from Huguenot refugees. Some of the earliest Huguenots to arrive in Australia held prominent positions in English society, notably Jane Franklin and Charles La Trobe.
Others who came later were from poorer Huguenot families. They migrated to Australia from England in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to escape the poverty in the East End of London, notably in the Huguenot enclaves of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green. Their impoverishment had been brought about by the impact of the Industrial Revolution, which caused the collapse of the Huguenot-dominated silk-weaving industry.
The largest post-war increase in French migration to Australia came during the 1960s and 1970s; unlike many other European countries, France did not establish a migration scheme in the immediate post-war period due to chronic underemployment, despite Australian seeing the French as some of the most desirable immigrants to obtain during that era.
Since that time, there has only been a small flow of French immigrants to Australia. Many people in the French-Australian community now originate from French overseas territories, especially New Caledonia.
Culture.
Today, the Brisbane French Festival, held over the Bastille Day weekend, is Australia's biggest French festival. Participants include both French-born Australians and Australians of more distant French ancestry.
Alliance Française has an active presence in most Australian cities, teaching the French language, holding cultural events such as Beaujolais Nouveau festivals and sponsoring the nation's annual French film festival [http://www.affrenchfilmfestival.org/]. SBS has also done much to increase the popularity of French cinema and culture with Australian audiences, though Hollywood still predominates with mainstream audiences. As well as providing a language service for French immigrants, SBS has allowed Australians of French ancestry to rediscover their cultural heritage.
Some Australians of French Huguenot descent have completely assimilated into the country's predominantly Anglo-Saxon culture but most still quietly but tenaciously hold onto as many aspects as they can of their French heritage and identify themselves very much as French Australians, even hundreds of years after being exiled. The Huguenot Society of Australia does much to encourage Australian Huguenots to embrace their cultural heritage and provides genealogical research services [http://www.huguenotsaustralia.org.au/].
French cuisine has had an impact on the nation with French-inspired cafes, restaurants and boulangeries to be found in most major cities [http://www.frenchaustralia.com.au/index.php]. French immigrant chefs, particularly those who appear on television, have done much to promote French cooking and food philosophy, including a growing understanding of the concept of terroir.
The French Benevolent Society has an active presence in the nation, providing a support network for elderly and incapacitated French Australians [http://frenchbenevolent.com/].
Most of the French-born people in Australia are Roman Catholics and the Reformed Church of France (Église Réformée de France) is yet to establish a presence in the country, despite the vibrant group of Australians of Huguenot descent. However, Taizé-style services are becoming increasingly popular with both Roman Catholics and Protestants from a variety of denominations. Taizé provides one of the key grassroots ecumenical movements in the nation.

Greenberg v. National Geographic

Greenberg v. National Geographic was a copyright lawsuit regarding image use and republication rights of National Geographic to their magazine in electronic form.
Details.
An electronic edition "The Complete National Geographic on CD-ROM and DVD," consisting of over 108 years of an exact image-based reproduction of each and every page of each monthly paper issue of "National Geographic magazine", has been tied up in copyright litigation for over ten years by a handful of prior photographers and contributors since shortly after the digital archive was issued in late 1997. National Geographic withdrew this archive from the market in 2004 until the litigation was resolved. 
Two federal appellate courts have ruled in the various cases. One case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled against National Geographic in 2001 ("Greenberg v. National Geographic") prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in a similar case later that same year involving the same statute of the U.S. Copyright law ("Tasini v. The New York Times et al."). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that "Greenberg" was inconsistent with the Supreme Court ruling in "Tasini," and ruled in favor of National Geographic in cases involving the same Complete National Geographic product. These New York cases were decided after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the "Tasini" case. In a decision announced June 13, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed its prior decision in Greenberg I and ruled that the "Complete National Geographic" was an appropriate reproduction under the Copyright Act since it maintained the context of its prior collective works. The appeals court said that the Second Circuit was correct in holding that Greenberg I was inconsistent with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Tasini case. On August 30, 2007, the Eleventh Circuit issued an order vacating the panel decision in Greenberg 2 and said the Court would hear the appeal en banc, or by all the judges on the Court, which was heard February 26, 2008. On June 30, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit held that National Geographic's reproduction of its magazine electronically was privileged under the federal copyright statute.
Results.
Since National Geographic's victory in the Second Circuit, several publications (including "The New Yorker", "Playboy", "Atlantic Monthly", and "Rolling Stone") have either produced or announced plans to produce complete reproductions of their prior paper magazines on DVD or a restricted website for subscribers.
As a result of this ruling National Geographic has announced it is releasing the full 120-year version of this magazine at the end of October 2009. Yearly updates are also promised.

List of Indiana covered bridges

This is a list of Indiana covered bridges. There are 98 historic wooden covered bridges in the U.S. state of Indiana. Fourteen of these bridges were built before 1870 and represent the most common truss styles (Burr Arch) in Indiana.
Parke County bills itself as the covered bridge capital of the world. Combined with six counties that surround it, there are 51 of Indiana’s 98 covered bridges in this small area: Parke County (32), Putnam County (9), Fountain County (3), Vermillion County (3), Montgomery County (2), Owen County (1) and Vigo County (1). The majority, 54, are Burr Arch truss designs, while the next most common truss style is a Howe Truss with 23.
One each of the older style King Post and Queen Post are located in the western part of the state; Philips Bridge, west of Rockville in Parke County and Irishman Bridge, south of Terre Haute in Vigo County, respectively. Indiana also has examples of the Long Truss and the Smith Type IV Truss. The remaining span of the Bell Ford Bridge, northwest of Seymour in Jackson County, collapsed in January 2006. It was the last standing example of a Post Truss covered bridge in the world.

Francisco de Borja

Francisco de Borja y Navarro de Alpicat (1441 – November 4, 1511) was a Spanish cardinal, and the seventh of ten cardinal-nephews created by Pope Alexander VI.
Borja was born in 1441 in Játiva, Spain and was a canon in the cathedral chapter of Valencia. After the election of Rodrigo Borja as Alexander VI by the papal conclave, 1492, Francisco went to Rome, becoming the protonotary apostolic, and then the treasurer general on September 20, 1493. He was elected bishop of Teano on August 19, 1495 and retained the see until June 5, 1508 when he resigned in favor of his nephew of the same name. There is no evidence he was ever consecrated. Alexander VI elevated Francisco as a cardinal priest on September 28, 1500 "in pectore" and published his cardinalate on October 2 adding the title of S. Cecilia on October 5.
He later accumulated a variety of additional benefices: first as Abbot "commendatario" of the monasteries of S. Vincenzo, Volturno, and of S. Stefano di Sermo, then the diocese of Terracina on August 19, 1495, and then the metropolitan see of Cosenza on November 6, 1499.
He was made papal legate to Campagna in 1501, and left Rome on June 22 to retake Rocca di Papa and other estates of the Colonna for the papacy. In 1502, he followed Lucrezia Borgia to Ferrara for her marriage to Alfonso d'Este, and became tutor to Alexander VI's youngest son, Gioffre Borgia.
From January 1503 to 1504, Borja held the title of Camerlengo, and during that time on March 10 he attempted to recover some debts owed to the College of Cardinals. He participated in the papal conclaves of September and October 1503, before gaining the title of Ss. Nereo ed Achilleo on August 11, 1506.
Along with other cardinals, Borja plotted against Pope Julius II, and from Ferrara, published in opposition to the pontiff. His signature is also affixed to the document dated March 16, 1511 which attempted to bring the pope to a council in Pisa; Borja delegated his authority "in absentia" to the five other cardinals who attended the council. As a result, Borja was deprived of his cardinalate and excommunicated by Julius II on October 24, 1511. The other councilars—Cardinals Federico di Sanseverino, Bernardino López de Carvajal, Guillaume Briçonnet, René de Prie, and Amanieu d'Albret (another cardinal-nephew of Alexander VI)—were also excommunicated, but unlike Borja they lived long enough to be pardoned and have their cardinalates reinstated in 1513 by Pope Leo X. Before death, Borja was briefly "protoprete" from January 1511, dying on November 4, 1511 in Reggio Emilia (where he is buried) before having had the opportunity to learn of his excommunication.

Wallace Martin Lindsay (12 February 1858 – 21 February 1937) was an important classical scholars of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and a palaeographer. He was Professor of Humanity at St Andrews University.
Biography.
W. M. Lindsay was born in Pittenweem, Fife, where his father was a Free Church minister. Educated at Edinburgh Academy, Glasgow University (where he was Blackstone Scholar) and Balliol College, Oxford. He was a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford from 1880 to 1899, when he was appointed as Professor of Humanity (as the professorship in Latin was called) at St Andrews University.
Lindsay wrote numerous studies, covering a range of topics in Latin from the works of Plautus and Martial to the development of medieval Latin. Some of his books were translated into French and German. He also wrote articles in the 1911 "Encyclopædia Britannica" and notes on the palaeography of the Cathach of St. Columba.
He pioneered the study of Latin (and Celtic) "words". Through prolific scholarship and editing a large number of texts, including Plautus, Terence, Martial in the OCT, and Festus, and Nonius Marcellus in Teubner editions, he influenced almost every area of Latin research.
He died at St Andrews after a collision with a motor bike.

Malcolm Knox

Sir Thomas Malcolm Knox FRSE (1900–1980) was an Anglo-Scottish philosopher who served as Principal of St Andrews University from 1953–66 and Vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1975-8.
Biography.
Knox was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, on 28 November 1900, the son of Scottish Congregationalist minister James Knox MA and Isabella Marshall. He was educated at Bury Grammar School and the Liverpool Institute, and then at Pembroke College, Oxford where he obtained a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1923. He then worked as secretary to Lord Leverhulme at Lever Brothers before running the business interests of Lever Brothers in West Africa. His first wife died in 1930 and in the following year he became Bursar-Fellow and lecturer in philosophy at Jesus College, Oxford, later becoming a Fellow and Tutor. His interests did not fit in with those then prevailing at Oxford and so he moved to St Andrews University as Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1936, serving also as deputy principal and head of department. He was thus the natural choice as acting principal in 1952 on the death of James Irvine, and was confirmed in position in 1953.
Knox was widely known to philosophers for his translations and commentary of the works of Hegel and for editing the works of R.G. Collingwood. His scholarship was recognised with the award of an Hon. D. Litt. from the University of Glasgow and election as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 
Whilst Principal of St Andrews, his main task reconcile the interests of the section of the university based in St Andrews with those of the section based in Dundee. However, he later concluded that separation of the two could not be avoided and then decided that it would not be proper to continue in his position as his stated policy had changed. In retirement, he continued to write books, articles and reviews, including translations with commentary upon the writings of Hegel.
Some of his papers are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee.
He died at 19 Victoria Terrace, Crieff, Tayside, on 6 April 1980.

Hiatus (30 Rock)

"Hiatus" is the twenty-first and season finale episode of NBC's first season of "30 Rock". It was written by series creator and executive producer Tina Fey, and was directed by Don Scardino. It first aired on April 26, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars in the episode included Katrina Bowden, Kevin Brown, Owen Burke, Grizz Chapman, Matt Dickinson, Rachel Dratch, Brittany Felton, Hannah Flynn, Sean Hayes, Emily Mortimer, Chris Parnell, Portia, Lonny Ross, Justin Smith, Elaine Stritch, Jason Sudeikis and Nikki E. Walker. Lester Holt appeared as himself in this episode.
The episode focuses on the imminent season finale of "TGS with Tracy Jordan", a fictional sketch comedy series which airs live on Friday nights. Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) is frantic because Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is still missing and Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) health threatens his marriage to Phoebe (Emily Mortimer).
Plot.
After going on the run from the Black Crusaders, Tracy has traveled to Needmore, Pennsylvania (an actual town located in Union Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania) to stay with Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) cousin, Jesse Parcell (Sean Hayes). Liz is stressed as the season finale of "TGS with Tracy Jordan" is nearing, and Tracy cannot be found. Liz and Jack force Tracy's whereabouts from Kenneth, who they send to bring him back. Tracy realizes that he wants to go back to the city, but Jesse kidnaps him. Kenneth, accompanied by Dot-Com and Grizz, manages to rescue Tracy and get him back in time for the show's finale.
Jack is livid when his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch), visits him when she is in town to attend his ex-wife Bianca's (Isabella Rossellini) wedding to Vincent Folley. Colleen takes an immediate dislike to Jack's fiancée, Phoebe, but takes a liking to Liz, whom she originally mistakes for Phoebe. The stress of his approaching wedding and the arrival of his mother prompt Jack to have a heart attack. While at the hospital, Colleen uses a heart monitor as a lie detector, on Jack, which leads him to revealing that he does not love Phoebe. They break off their engagement.

Production.
Rachel Dratch, longtime comedy partner and fellow "Saturday Night Live" alumna of Fey, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch played the role in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement. Executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that while Dratch would not be playing a series regular, she would appear in various episodes in a different role. In this episode, Dratch played Dr. Beauvoir, Liz's doctor.
Jason Sudeikis, who played Floyd in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of "Saturday Night Live", a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on "Saturday Night Live" from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of "Saturday Night Live" have appeared on "30 Rock". These cast members include Rachel Dratch, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Chris Parnell and Molly Shannon. Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of "Saturday Night Live". Alec Baldwin has also hosted "Saturday Night Live" thirteen times, the second highest amount of episodes of any host of the series.
The scenes set in the Needmore, Pennsylvania were actually filmed in Douglaston, Queens. Similarly, the scenes in Cleveland from the previous episode were filmed in Battery Park City, Manhattan.
Reception.
"Hiatus" brought in an average of 4.7 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 2.4/6 in the key 18–49-year-old demographic. The 2.4 refers to 2.4% of all people of ages 18–49 years old in the U.S., and the 6 refers to 6% of all people of ages 18–49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S. This episode was watched by 200,000 people upon its original broadcast in the United Kingdom.
Robert Canning of IGN said that this episode left him feeling "a bit cheated." He said that this was because "the storylines we've loved for weeks all failed to come to a satisfying end." He added that "after a string of stellar episodes, it's not surprising "30 Rock" eventually faltered." Canning rated this episode with a "6.5 out of 10." Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" wrote that he "didn't find this episode "quite" as manic as the previous few, but that's probably because it had actual story to progress and threads to tie up."
Elaine Stritch's appearance in this episode earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Stritch would later appear as Colleen in the episodes "Ludachristmas," which was part of season two; "Christmas Special" and "The Natural Order" in season three; "The Moms" in season four; "Christmas Attack Zone" in season five; "Meet the Woggels!" in season six; and "My Whole Life Is Thunder" in the show's seventh and final season.

Telltale were a group of six musicians who regularly appeared on the first series of the British TV series Rainbow in 1972.
Telltale began with Tim Thomas and Hugh Portnow who were working with the Freehold Theatre Company. In 1970, Tim concentrated on forming a group of musicians and actors, and Hugh joined him a year later. Hugh Fraser, Chris Ashley and Fluff Joinson joined later, with the final member Ted Richards joining the group in the summer of 1972.
The three members of Portnow, Fraser and Thomas also wrote the theme tune to Rainbow.
The group recorded a total of 14 songs for the show, including "Shapes", and "Walk in the country".
The band feature on a vinyl LP album released by MFP in 1973 called Rainbow (catalogue number MFP50087), which occasionally surfaces on sites such as eBay.

Crime in Cape Verde

The minor crimes of petty theft and burglary are common in Cape Verde, especially in crowds, such as market places, festivals, and celebrations. Often the perpetrators of these crimes are gangs of street children. As of 2008, local police statistics reflect an increase in crime in Cape Verde, particularly in the cities of Praia and Mindelo.
As of 2008, muggings occur more often than previously, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and occasionally violence is associated with them. Crime associated with drugs and drug-use is also on the rise. Due to lack of lighting in many public areas and periodic blackouts, the U.S. government has advised travelers to carry small flashlights, travel with others, keep vehicle doors and windows locked, avoid dark and isolated places, and be especially vigilant in the evenings.
Violent crime is also increasing in Cape Verde as of 2008. There were several murders and attempted murders between May 2007 and May 2008, mostly reported in the urban centers of Praia and Mindelo, although Sal and other islands have not been immune. Allegedly the US has been deporting criminals of Cape Verdean nationality back to their country of origin and gang warfare has begun between the deportees as they are rivals for local distribution and onward transport of illegal drugs coming principally from South America.

There are 32 granite steps which lead to the lantern that are cantilevered without the use of mortar. The original stone keeper's house was loaded on a barge and taken to Wing's Neck Light in 1923. The light was deactivated from 1951 to 1963 after the land was sold to the town of Mattapoisett for use as a park.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

Health in Cape Verde

Health care in Cape Verde is limited, as medical facilities and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. There are hospitals in Praia, Mindelo and São Filipe on the island of Fogo, with smaller medical facilities in other places. One of the most important hospitals of Cape Verde is Agostinho Neto Hospital in Praia with about 350 beds. In several residential areas of Praia and in many towns there are health clinics and pharmacies. The islands of Brava and Santo Antão no longer have functioning airports so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is nearly impossible from these two islands. Brava also has limited inter-island ferry service, but there is a pharmacy and a small health clinic in the town Vila Nova Sintra.
Starting from July 2012, a telemedicine program, funded by the Republic of Slovenia through ITF Enhancing Human Security and implemented by the US based NGO, the International Virtual e-Hospital, is building a hospital based telemedicine network for the whole country. As of January 2014, all the inhabited islands of the country are connected through an integrated telemedicine network representing the first case in Africa of such an approach to telemedicine.
Malaria exists in Cape Verde, although not to the extent found in mainland Africa. The risk of contracting malaria is mainly limited to the island of Santiago, with a higher risk from July to December.
HIV/AIDS.
According to Ministry of Health estimates, since the beginning of the pandemic through December 2004, 1,489 Cape Verdeans have been infected with HIV, translating to a relatively low HIV prevalence rate. Of these identified cases, 800 (53.7 percent) contracted AIDS and 53 of those died from complications related to HIV/AIDS. At the end of 2004 there were 1,063 people living with HIV, and 374 of these with AIDS. In 2004 alone, 260 people became newly infected with HIV, and 123 of these people are living with AIDS. According to 2004 figures from the national HIV/AIDS Commission, 50 percent of HIV cases are between 25 and 49 years old; and among teens, girls accounted for more than half of new HIV-positive infections reported.

Jan Dietz

Jean Leonardus Gerardus (Jan) Dietz (born 20 June 1945) is a Dutch Information systems researcher, Emeritus Professor of Information Systems Design, and part-time Professor of Enterprise Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, known for the development of the Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations. and his work on enterprise ontology.
Biography.
Born in Brunssum, Dietz studied at the Eindhoven University of Technology, where in 1970 he obtained his MA in Electrical Engineering, and later in 1987 his PhD with the thesis entitled "Modelleren en specificeren van informatiesystemen" (Specification and modeling of information systems) under supervision of Kees van Hee en Theo Bemelmans. 
Dietz has been practitioner in the field of automation and information systems from 1970 to 1980. Here he developed one of the first relational model based production control systems at Philips Factories, a state of the art computer accounting system at Eindhoven University of Technology, and a terminal-based, interactive theatre reservation system. In 1980 he returned to the academia. After graduation in 1987 he was appointed Professor of Management Information Systems at the University of Maastricht at the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, where he started the development of the DEMO theory and methodology. From September 1994 to Oct 2009 he was Professor of Information Systems Design at Delft University of Technology. Since then he is part-time Professor of Enterprise Engineering at the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST - Technical University of Lisbon). Since 2010 he is part-time Professor of Enterprise Engineering at Delft TopTech at the Delft University of Technology.
Dietz has been chairman of the Dutch national professional association of informaticians, has been editorial board member of several journals, and has been in the program committee of - and has chaired - numerous conferences. He has been the Dutch national representative in IFIP TC8 on Information Systems for many years and is member of IFIP WG8.1 on design and Evaluation of Information Systems.
Work.
Dietz' main research interests is in modeling, design and redesigning and engineering and reengineering of organizations, and in the development of ICT-applications to support them. In the new millennium Dietz has focussed on the emerging field of Enterprise engineering, which emerged in between information systems engineering and the organizational sciences. 
In 2006 he published a book on Enterprise Ontology, and is continuing working on Enterprise Architecture. To promote these ideas he initiated an international network under the name "Cooperation & Interoperability - Architecture & Ontology" (CIAO).
Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations.
Inspired on the Language Action Perspective in the 1980s Dietz has been developing a methodology for transaction modelling, and analysing and representing business processes called Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The Language Action Perspective itself is largely based on the speech act theory developed by John Searle. It was introduced in the field of information systems by the computer scientists Fernando Flores and J.J. Ludlow early 1980s has "proven to be a new basic paradigm for Information Systems Design. In contrast to traditional views of "data flow", the language/action perspective emphasizes what people do while communicating, how they create a common reality by means of language, and how communication brings about a coordination of their activities".
In DEMO the basic pattern of a business transaction is composed of the following three phases:
Basic transactions can be composed to account for complex transactions. The DEMO methodology gives the analyst an understanding of the business processes of the organization, as well as the agents involved, but is less clear about pragmatics aspects of the transaction, such as the conversation structure and the intentions generated in each agents mind. 
Jan Dietz is the founder of the DEMO, and he is also co-founder and chairman of the DEMO Knowledge Center and he has participated in numerous practical DEMO-projects regarding the redesign and reengineering of organizations. Since early 2004 he is also the leader of the national research program Extensible Architecture Framework.
Enterprise Ontology.
Enterprise Ontology is about the need to develop organizational models on a high-level of abstraction, in order to be able to develop effective and efficient, so called, inter- and intra-enterprise information systems. These models need to be so that it is understood both by business people, who are defining their functionality, and software engineers, who are constructing and implementing the software systems that realize the system's functionality. The idea of business components for modeling information systems is very valuable since they directly reflect the business rules and the constraints that apply to the enterprise domain. 
The identification of business components seems still to be in its infancy. The notion of enterprise ontology, as developed by Jan Dietz at Delft University of Technology, appears to be a powerful revelation of the essence of an enterprise or an enterprise network. Dietz' research seeks to improve the identification of business components based on the ontological model of an enterprise, while at the same time satisfying well defined quality criteria. The results of applying the developed identification method are reusable and self-contained business components with well defined interaction points that facilitate the accessing and execution of coherent packages of business functionality.
Publications.
Dietz has published over 200 scientific and professional papers as well as several books: Books:

Youth Conservation Corps

The Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) is a summer work youth program in federally managed lands. The National Park Service, US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management employ teens each summer to participate in the YCC. The YCC has introduced young Americans to conservation opportunities in public lands since the program was created in 1970. In the late seventies and early eighties the program included a grant-in-aid component that funded state and local YCC projects nationwide. This element fell to 1982 budget cuts, but several states continued the effort with their own funds. Some employees currently working in land management agencies were introduced to their profession through the YCC.
Youth Conservation Corps members work in public lands restoring, rehabilitating, and repairing the natural, cultural, and historical resources protected as federally preserved places. Some examples of work completed each season by Youth Conservation Corps are:
Participants are paid the established federal minimum wage. Participants in states with a minimum wage higher than the federal are paid at the higher rate.
Youth Conservation Corps programs are conducted for 8–10 weeks during the summer. Participants must be between 14–18 years old at the start of the program, though the age limits can vary locally. Most YCC programs are non-residential; however the National Park Service does have two residential programs at Yosemite National Park (CA) and Yellowstone National Park (WY, MT, ID).
The Youth Conservation Corp focuses on conservation and community. These are some of the aspects they focus on:
Recruitment for the YCC within the National Park Service is done at individual sites participating in the program. 
The National Park Service webpage: provides information about how to enroll in the Youth Conservation Corps. Applications may be found on the NPS webpage and must be sent to parks of interest by April 15. Enrollees are selected without regard to civil service or classification laws, rules or regulation. The selection process is conducted in a public forum by the random method.
YCC is a partnership between the US Department of Interior and US Department of Agriculture established by Public Law 93-408. Since its inception, the YCC has worked with many conservation agencies throughout the country to provide educational and team building skills to young people through participation in work projects.

Goronwy Edwards

Sir (John) Goronwy Edwards F.B.A. (1891 – 20 June 1976) was a Welsh historian. After 29 years as a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, he spent 12 years as Director of the Institute of Historical Research and Professor of History at the University of London.
Biography.
Edwards, who was proficient in Welsh before he could read English, was educated at Holywell Grammar School before matriculating at Jesus College, Oxford in 1909. His 1913 essay on Danby gained him proxime accessit in the Stanhope prize competition. After obtaining his degree in 1913, he worked for a time at Manchester University before serving with the Royal Welch Fusiliers during the First World War. He obtained the rank of captain and served in France. In 1919, he returned to Jesus College as Fellow and Tutor in History, where he specialised in medieval English and Welsh history, serving also as Senior Tutor for 13 years. He was highly regarded as a lecturer, tutor and supervisor of research students. He was joint editor of the English Historical Review from 1938 and was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy in 1943. He had hoped to be appointed Principal of the college when it fell vacant on the death of Alfred Hazel. Instead, the decision was taken to appoint Frederick Ogilvie as principal, with Edwards becoming vice-principal.
In 1948, Edwards accepted the invitation to become Director of the Institute of Historical Research and Professor of History at the University of London. In addition to his continuing scholarship, he also presided over many committees with, it was said, "exemplary patience". In addition, he served on the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire, and the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. He was knighted in July 1960, shortly before his retirement. He was president of the Royal Historical Society from 1961 to 1965. 
He was awarded the Cymmrodorion medal on his eightieth birthday to mark his service to Wales. He died on 20 June 1976 at the age of 85.

The Norfolk Wherry Trust is a waterway society and registered charity 1084156 in Norfolk, England, UK. based at Womack Water near Ludham, Norfolk Broads. 
The Trust keeps afloat "Albion", an example of the Norfolk Trading Wherry, so that she can be seen on the rivers and broads. 
Albion was built in 1898 - unusually - as a carvel wherry in oak on oak frames, by William Brighton, Lake Lothing, Suffolk (between Oulton Broad and Lowestoft) for Bungay Maltsters WD and AE Walker. All other trading wherries in East Anglia were clinker built. Albion's first load was coal from Lowestoft to Bungay.
Albion was bought by the General Steam Navigation Company in the Thirties, and later she became a lighter until she was discovered by the Trust in 1949.
In February 1949, a letter in the Eastern Daily Press suggested the forming of a trust to preserve a wherry. The fifty-year-old wherry Albion was then owned by Colman's Mustard factory and was moored at the company's works at Carrow Bridge in Norwich. In October 1949, after restoration work, Albion sailed regularly from Great Yarmouth to Norwich, carrying timber or grain, and sugar beet from Surlingham to Cantley.
However, freight alone could not sustain Albion, and from 1961, she carried passengers. In 1981 The Norfolk Wherry Trust acquired a base at Womack Water near Ludham. During 1997, the black-sailed ex-trader Albion carried 648 persons; she can carry 12 people plus skipper and mate.

<doc id="18560169" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18560169" title="80/20 Thinking">
80/20 Thinking

80/20 Thinking Limited was launched in January 2008 as a UK-based global privacy consultancy specialising in corporate and consumer advice in the fields of privacy, data protection, information security and corporate social responsibility. The company takes its name from the Pareto principle of cause and effect (also known as the 80/20 rule). It is a wholly independent company, owned and managed by its principal directors. 
The company announced in a public statement on April 13, 2009 that as of August that year it would no longer engage with clients in a commercial capacity to provide consulting and advisory services and that, instead, it would focus on researching and developing privacy technology such as impact and audit tools amongst others. This change in mandate was partially due to the perception of conflict of interest between 80/20 Thinking and the involvement of its directors in the NGO Privacy International.
People.
The company was incorporated in the UK on 25 January 2008 and was founded by Simon Davies, Thomas H. Dee and Dr. Gus Hosein. In addition to their work with Privacy International and 80/20 Thinking, Simon Davies and Gus Hosein are both Visiting Senior Fellows in the London School of Economics. 
80/20 Thinking's CEO Simon Davies, is also founder and director of Privacy International, one of the leading privacy advocacy bodies. This dual role has been the cause of some public controversy (see below).
80/20 Thinking (occasionally truncated to "80/20") also comprises an advisory group including Sir Howard Davies, Director of the London School of Economics, security expert Bruce Schneier, the Earl of Northesk, the Countess of Mar, and business leaders such as Ray Stanton, Global Head of Security Business & Continuity for British Telecom.
The enterprise did not seek startup funding or investment, and was entirely financed by the founders.
Strategic partners.
80/20 Thinking has aligned itself with a number of partner organisations, including strategic public affairs partner Burson-Marsteller and its academic partner the London School of Economics The company's legal partner is Covington & Burling
Notable clients.
Among the company's clients are:
The Financial Times profiled the company at its inception, giving an overview of its work and that of its CEO as part of a wider piece covering online Privacy.
Activities.
At the 80/20 launch in London in May 2008 Simon Davies surprised guests by remarking "I'd like to stand up here and tell you we have a business plan, but we don't". This admission is reflected in the company's organic growth, which has unpredictably - and even erratically - cut across the privacy spectrum. 
Amongst the company's most prominent work has been the creation of Privacy Impact Assessments, which it has undertaken for organisations as diverse as the controversial Phorm targeted advertising system to the refugee centres of the United Nations. 
In addition to its privacy assessment work, 80/20 Thinking has started to develop open enrollment and bespoke Privacy training courses. The company is currently vying for wide-scale public sector training in the UK.
A series of partnerships is also currently in train to establish a global privacy recruitment service for privacy professionals, including Chief Privacy Officers and Data Protection Officers.
Notable projects.
The Working Group on Consumer Consent.
In March 2008 80/20 took on management of a new project on informed customer consent, focusing on the online environment. The project, convened by the London School of Economics, involves Microsoft, BT, AOL, Vodafone, eBay & Facebook and aims to establish a cross-industry framework of understanding on the issue of informed consent for the processing of personal information. The project was created in response to a number of “Article 29” Opinions concerning Personally Identifiable Information. (See Article 29). The project has the formal support of the Information Commissioners of Ireland, France, the UK, Berlin, Madrid and Slovenia.
United Nations.
80/20 Thinking is currently undertaking work with the UNHCR. As external evaluators to UNHCR 80/20 forms a core part of the internal UN evaluation of the registration systems operating in the camps, focusing on the use of fingerprinting technology. The evaluation commenced in June 2008 in Malaysia which was then followed by an evaluations of camps in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya. 80/20 will then produce an independent Privacy Impact Assessment for UNHCR.
Ethics and public service.
80/20 Thinking declares itself to be an ethical operation. This claim is demonstrated in part by a stated commitment to donate 50% of its profits to civil society groups working in developing countries. The Association for Progressive Communications (APC) is 80/20's charitable partner. APC announced the arrangement on its website in April 2008. The aim of the partnership is to support initiatives in developing countries that are working towards strengthening democratic processes and civil liberties.
The partnership will offer a form of independent income that can be used to further APC’s internet rights program.
80/20 also diverts funds from its operating budget for "pro bono" work, including all administrative, consulting and travel expenses relating to the UNHCR missions.
Controversy.
From the start, 80/20 Thinking was subject to a degree of controversy in relation to its involvement with online marketing firm Phorm. Phorm commissioned 80/20 Thinking to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) prior to its UK public launch. The controversy related in particular to the involvement of Davies and Hosein as perception was widespread that Privacy International was endorsing Phorm. Davies later released a statement confirming that the work was solely an 80/20 Thinking Project and that Privacy International was not in the business of conducting PIA's for private ventures, much less promoting their services. 
Some critics have expressed concern that Davies, who is sometimes described as the world's leading privacy advocate, has compromised his independence by undertaking commercial contracts.
This issue was extensively covered in online and offline media, perhaps most notably in the article written by Charles Arthur of The Guardian.
In response to the criticism, Davies said: 
"Will people please read our report to Phorm. Read it in its brief entirety, once you'll do, you'll realise that there are no conflicts whatever. In that report we argue that the system should be opt-in, that there are unresolved questions, that the matter of legal compliance is irrelevant to the issue of intrusion."
On Tuesday April 15, 2008, 80/20 facilitated a Phorm "Town Hall" debate with open participation from public and media. The event overview can be found on the 80/20 Thinking website.
Present as a panelist at the meeting was Dr. Richard Clayton of Cambridge University and FIPR
The Google affair and change of direction.
On April 13, 2009, 80/20 Thinking made a public statement announcing that as of August 2009 it would no longer provide training or advisory services to clients in a commercial capacity and that instead, it would convert the company mandate to the research and development of privacy technologies worldwide.
This was heavily covered in the UK and Global media as it followed the “Google War” as reported in the Guardian and other papers 
Privacy International has long been a vocal critic of some practices of the US search company Google. Public hostility between the two organizations came to a head following Privacy International’s legal action against the Google Street View product. Google asserted that Privacy International and its director were “far from impartial”. Following a significant amount of publicity about this claim 80/20 Thinking’s directors then issued a statement explaining that the company had taken the decision to cut all commercial consulting relations to avoid such future claims of conflict of interest with Privacy International.

Matthäus Seutter

Georg Matthäus Seutter (also "Matthias Seutter"; 1678-1757) was one of the most important and prolific German map publishers of the 18th century.
Seutter started his career as an apprentice brewer. Apparently uninspired by the beer business, Seutter left his apprenticeship and moved to Nuremberg where he apprenticed as an engraver under the tutelage of the prominent J. B. Homann. Sometime in the early 18th century Seutter left Homann to establish his own independent cartographic publishing firm in Augsburg. Though he struggled in the early years of his independence, Seutter’s engraving skill and commitment to diversified map production eventually gained him a substantial following. Most of Seutter’s maps were heavily based upon, if not copies of, earlier work done by the Homann and Delisle firms. By 1732 Seutter was one of the most prolific publishers of his time and was honored by the German Emperor Charles VI with the title of “Imperial Geographer”. Seutter continued to publish until his death, at the height of his career, in 1757.
The Seutter firm continued under Seutter’s wastrel son Albrecht Carl until his death in 1762. Following Albrecht’s death, the firm was divided between the established Probst firm and the emerging firm of Tobias Conrad Lotter. Lotter, Matthäus Seutter’s son in law, was a master engraver and worked on behalf of the Seutter firm. Lotter would eventually become one of the most prominent cartographers of his day.

Hubbardston Public Library

Hubbardston Public Library is a historic library at 7 Main Street in Hubbardston, Massachusetts.
The Hubbardston Public Library was founded in 1872, and originally housed its collection of books in the local Mechanics Hall. In 1874, Jonas G. Clark, a native of Hubbardston and founder of Clark University, purchased the Main Street Property and funded the construction of the brick and stone library building.
The building is in the Second Empire/Italianate style and was designed by Elbridge Boyden and Son, of Worcester. It was built in 1874. In September 1875, the Hubbardston Public Library opened the doors at its 7 Main Street location, where you can find it today. The first floor was originally half library, half post office, hence the pained plaques you might notice flanking the front door. The gallery level was added to the rear of the building in 1929. Many residents recall the gallery's original translucent glass floor. In 1998 the library was added to the National Historic Register. The property underwent a historical restoration project in 2000 to address many of its needed repairs and is looking quite grand for its age of 128 years.
The present day library serves the Town by providing a wide variety of materials, services, and events. Best selling books, videos, books on tape and magazines are available to loan. Internet access is available to the public as well as access to the CWMARS resource-sharing catalog. For a small fee, the public may use the copy machine and fax machine.

Mindoro Cut

Mindoro Cut is a cut in the Town of Farmington in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, which carries Wisconsin Highway 108 through Phillips Ridge, linking Mindoro with West Salem. The cut is deep, long, and wide; it is the second-deepest cut built by hand in the Western Hemisphere and the oldest functional cut which has not been improved upon. Work on the cut began in 1907 and concluded in 1908; the project was completed primarily with hand tools. The Mindoro Cut was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.
History.
Mindoro farmers and La Crosse County officials commissioned the Mindoro Cut as part of the Good Roads Movement, linking a creamery in Mindoro with a railroad station in West Salem. Before the cut was made, Phillips Ridge was too steep to be traversed, so traffic to Mindoro had to take a longer route bypassing the ridge. Construction on the cut began in 1907 and was primarily conducted with hand tools, though dynamite was also used. Planners initially thought the ridge was composed entirely of sandstone; construction became more difficult when it was realized that the ridge had an interior made of hard dolomite. Since horses could not be effectively used on the steep slope, waste rock was removed from the site via wheelbarrows which were balanced on narrow, uneven planks. Louis Miller, a contractor and supervisor of the project, would fire workers who toppled their wheelbarrow three times; many workers reportedly left the job after bringing their first load down the ridge. Workers were paid $1.25 per day and purchased meals from an on-site cook shanty. The project was completed in 1908; its ultimate cost was $11,241.29, reportedly a loss to its contractors. The highway was paved through the cut and guardrails were put in place in 1920; the cut has not been changed since. The cut was added to the Wisconsin State Register of Historic Places in October 2006 and the National Register of Historic Places on May 15, 2007.

Atherton Bridge

Atherton Bridge is a historic iron truss bridge on Bolton Road in Lancaster, Massachusetts, spanning the South Branch of the Nashua River. It is a rare example of a hybrid pony truss that is similar to the 19th century truss design of Simeon S. Post. It was built by J.H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia in 1870. It was the first iron bridge to be constructed in the town.
It was closed to vehicular traffic in 1975 and replaced by a modern highway bridge in the 1980s. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
Technical information.
The Atherton Bridge has iron compression posts that incline inward towards the center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented "Phoenix" columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck.
The bridge is 72 feet long and 18½ feet wide, and is composed of eight panels. It rests on granite abutments.
The bridge was photographed in 1979 by Jet Lowe of the Historic American Engineering Record, and documented in 1990 as part of the Massachusetts Historic Bridge Project.<ref name="memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hh:1:./temp/~ammem_Pr5I::"/> It is still open to pedestrian traffic via a loop path from Bolton Road.

Lancaster Industrial School for Girls is a historic school in Lancaster, Massachusetts built in 1790 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
It was the country's first state reform school for girls, opening on August 26 1856. It closed in 1973. 
So called industrial schools paved the way of social reform, moving away from child imprisonment towards a correctional paradigm. This was in part achieved because of the observed benefits of environmental change in children, as well as the importance of education plus the added pressures of having to deal with the rise in child delinquency brought by social changes of the industrial age.
After its closure, it was redeveloped into Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Lancaster.

Ammunition box

An ammunition box or cartouche box is a container designed for safe transport and storage of ammunition. It is typically made of metal and labelled with caliber, quantity, and manufacturing date or lot number. A rubber gasket is commonly found in the hinged lid to protect the ammunition from moisture damage.
Due to their durable construction, used metal ammunition boxes are popularly re-used for general storage and other purposes Players in the sport of geocaching commonly use ammunition boxes as the containers to hide logbooks and treasures. Used boxes are often sold at military surplus stores.
The resealing ammunition box is largely a NATO tradition. Warsaw Pact nations typically stored and transported ammunition in single-use "spam cans". They had crates that had lead lining the inside, but it was basically a bigger "spam can". In World War II, Duct tape was used to seal ammo boxes.
Not all ammunition boxes are metal, however. Wood and paper have also historically been used as a method of packaging and selling ammunition. Some enthusiasts and investors collect historical ammunition boxes.
Note.
Ammunition boxes have lead and propellant residue inside, so they should not be used to store food or drink. Commercially made new or fully reconditioned used cans do not have this problem.

Dog Gone People

Dog Gone People is a "Merrie Melodies" cartoon animated short starring Elmer Fudd. Released November 12, 1960, the cartoon is directed by Robert McKimson. Elmer is voiced by Hal Smith, one of the voice actors who replaced Arthur Q. Bryan in the role after Bryan's death.
The main plot revolves around Elmer doing a favor to his boss by watching his dog, Rupert, during an out-of-town trip ... the catch being that Rupert behaves as though he is a human and expects to be treated accordingly, and that Elmer must do everything he can to not offend his guest or risk losing out on more than just a work promotion.
Summary.
Elmer receives a phone call from his demanding boss, Mr. E.J. Crabtree, asking him to watch his dog, Rupert, while he goes on vacation. Crabtree admonishes Fudd that Rupert thinks he's human and expects to be treated like one, then informs him that there are two ways to go in the company -- "up (clears his throat) ... or down!" If Fudd does a good job, there may be a vice presidency available at the company for him, Crabtree continues.
Elmer does everything he can to not offend Rupert, but unwittingly fails at the simplest, seemingly banal tasks. First, Fudd turns on the TV so the two of them can watch "Classie", with Fudd stopping Rupert only after reminding him that humans also enjoy watching an adventure series about a dog. Later, Fudd—fixing himself a steak—feeds Rupert dog food, prompting the irritated mutt to once again walk out; Fudd appeases his guest only after eating the dog food himself! That night, when Rupert tries to sleep on the bed, Fudd tries to shoo him out, only for the dog to call his boss to report the offense; a frustrated Fudd, reminded of the consequences of doing an unacceptable job caring for Rupert, winds up sleeping in the dog bed.
The next morning, as Elmer is fixing breakfast, Rupert accidentally gets into the medicine cabinet and drinks bay rum (because he saw Fudd gargling mouth wash and does the same thing). When Elmer sees that Rupert is drunk, he takes him out for a ride to sober him up. However, Rupert somehow gets control of the car and speeds through town, terrifying Fudd as Rupert drives through stores and causes a major accident. In the end, a motorcycle cop pulls Rupert over and both the dog and Elmer are charged with driving while intoxicated.
When Crabtree posts bail for Elmer and Rupert, he tells Fudd that he will be moving up ... "up, up, up, up" in the company. Elmer indeed does move up—to the top of the flag pole atop the E.J. Crabtree office skyscraper. As Elmer bitterly muses that he thought he was going to be vice president, the appointee for the position—none other than Rupert—is sitting comfortably at his new desk.

Captain Lawrence Brewing Company

Captain Lawrence Brewing Company is an award-winning craft brewery located in Elmsford, NY. The brewery is owned and run by head brewer Scott Vaccaro. Vaccaro, a homebrewer since 1995, trained in brewing science at UC Davis.
Many of Captain Lawrence's beers are strongly influenced by traditional Belgian ale styles, although often with an American twist. Barrel-aging and ales with sourness or flavors contributed by wild yeasts, such as Brettanomyces, and bacteria are also part of their repertoire.
Like many small breweries, Captain Lawrence seeks to be environmentally sensitive, including donating spent grain to a local farmer for use as cattle feed. Their beers are fermented in stainless steel cylindro-conical vessels.
The brewery takes its name from Captain Lawrence Drive in South Salem, NY - the road on which Vaccaro's childhood home is located. The street is named after Samuel Lawrence (1733-1796) who was a Captain in the Westchester County Militia, 3rd Regiment during the American Revolution.
The facility in Elmsford is open for tastings, visits, and retail sales Wednesday through Friday, 4-8pm, Saturdays, noon - 6pm and Sundays noon - 5pm Growlers are available for take-out. Half kegs and mini kegs (5 gal.) can be purchased by arrangement via the brewery website: CaptainLawrenceBrewing.com
History.
Vaccaro brewed his first beer before he was legally allowed to drink. As a teenager in high school he saw a friend's father brewing beer at home, asked if he could participate, and was told it would be ok if he got his parent's permission first. After entering Villanova University to study accounting, Scott realized his real desire was to become a professional brewer. He transferred to UC Davis and studied fermentation science. 
He interned at Adnams Brewery, in the U.K. Following graduation he worked at Sierra Nevada and the short-lived Colorado Brewery in Danbury, Connecticut.
Captain Lawrence Brewing Company was founded in 2006. The first brewery was located on Castleton Street in Pleasantville, NY and had a 20 barrel system. After five years, needing more space to operate a bottling line and a larger system to increase capacity, the brewery was relocated to Elmsford, NY, approximately five miles from the original brewery. The new facility has a 40 barrel brewing system and more fermentation capacity. There is also a small seven barrel system for experimental and specialty batches. The new brewery began operation in 2011.
