John S. Preston

John Smith Preston (April 20, 1809 – May 1, 1881) was a wealthy planter, soldier, and attorney who became prominent in South Carolina politics in the 19th century. An ardent secessionist, he was the state's delegate dispatched to help convince the Virginia Secession Convention to join South Carolina in seceding from the antebellum Union in the months prior to the start of the American Civil War.
Biography.
Preston was born at "Salt Works," a sprawling estate owned by a prominent military family near Abingdon, Virginia. He was a son of General Francis Preston and Sarah Buchanan (Campbell) Preston. He graduated from Hampden-Sydney College in 1824, and then studied law at the University of Virginia and Harvard College. He passed his bar exam and established a practice in Abingdon. On April 28, 1830, he married Caroline Hampton, a daughter of South Carolina's wealthiest planter, Wade Hampton. They eventually had eight children. 
Preston took up residence in Columbia, South Carolina, and established a legal practice there. He later invested heavily in a sugar plantation, The Houmas, near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which prospered and gained him substantial wealth.
An strong supporter of states' rights, Preston joined the Democratic Party and was elected to the South Carolina State Senate for several successive terms, serving from 1848 until 1856. He was a delegate from South Carolina to 1860 Democratic National Convention.
During the early part of the Civil War, Preston served as an aide to General P.G.T. Beauregard. He later accepted a commission as an officer in the Confederate Army and headed the bureau of conscription in Richmond. In 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general. His fashionable mansion, the Hampton-Preston House, was seized by the Union Army during the 1865 occupation of Columbia and used as the headquarters of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan.
After the war, Preston traveled to England, not returning to the United States until 1868. He remained a strong defender of the Confederacy until the end of his life. 
Preston died in Columbia on May 1, 1881. Interment was at the Trinity Cathedral Cemetery in Columbia.

This is an esteemed critical exposition of Gratian's "Decretum", sometimes ranked second only to Antonio Agostino's work. It sets forth the original authorities of the "Decretum", though clumsy at distinguishing genuine sources from those that are spurious. A compendium of this work by an unknown writer, published at Venice, 1778, is entitled, "Compendium Commentariorum Caroli Sebastiani Berardi in Canones Gratiani."

King Cole Bar

The King Cole Bar is an upscale cocktail lounge in The St. Regis Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.
Many mixologists believe the Bloody Mary made its first U.S. appearance in the King Cole Bar. The drink was then called "The Red Snapper," after originally being invented by Fernand Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, France. Others contend that the iconic drink, now one of the Official Cocktails of the International Bartenders Association, was indeed invented in the King Cole Bar.
Originally, the King Cole Bar was about fifty feet east of the small but ornate lobby of The St. Regis. It was a large room with many circular tables and a long north-south bar above which was the famous Parrish painting. In more recent years, the bar was moved to a far smaller room east of that spot. The wonderful mural, or perhaps a slightly smaller version of the painting, is still in the bar. It features "Old King Cole" who was a "merry old soul" calling for his 'fiddlers three' and some other musicians. 
The lounge has a large mural by artist Maxfield Parrish hanging behind the bar, from which the venue derives its name.

Spencer Cone Jones

Spencer Cone Jones (July 3, 1836 – April 1, 1915), was the President of the Maryland State Senate, Mayor of Rockville, Maryland and Maryland State Treasurer. Spencer Cone Jones was the son of Reverend Joseph H. Jones (1798–1871), a Baptist minister, and Elizabeth (Clagett) Jones. He attended Rockville Academy, Frederick County public schools and Frederick College. After entering the legal profession, Jones practiced with William J. Ross of Frederick, and was admitted to the Frederick County bar in 1860.
Civil War.
Jones enlisted in Company D of the First Maryland Cavalry of the Confederate Army at the beginning of the American Civil War. In May 1862, he was thrown in jail for eight months. Jones was first arrested as a prisoner of war and was thrown in the Baltimore City Jail. He was subsequently transferred between Fort McHenry and Fort Delaware for interrogation. He was listed both as a political prisoner and as a prisoner of war. Jones was released from Fort McHenry on December 16, 1863. In February 1864, Jones was indicted in Frederick County Circuit Court for levying war and was disbarred by the Frederick County Court in 1865. The charges were dropped in March 1866. After the war, Jones taught school near Huntsville, Texas, and returned to Maryland after the adoption of the state constitution of 1867. Jones continued to be influential among many former Confederates, speaking at meetings of war veterans, including the dedication of a memorial to the Confederate dead in Winchester, Virginia.
Professional life.
Jones returned to Maryland in 1868 established a law practice in Rockville, Maryland. On December 21, 1871, he married Ellen Brewer, daughter of John and Elizabeth Stewart (Buchanan) Brewer. On January 31, 1875, Ellen Jones gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, who later married Thomas R. Falvy of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mrs. Jones died on July 21, 1876
A Democrat, Jones was elected State's Attorney of Montgomery County in 1871 and re-elected in 1875. He also served as clerk of the Maryland Court of Appeals, from 1879 to 1891. During this period, Jones was often appointed to serve as a Trustee in equity cases that were heard before the Montgomery County Circuit Court. He also rose to a high position within the Maryland Democratic Party, speaking frequently at state party conventions, as well as Democratic parties and rallies. The Maryland legislature elected him Treasurer of the State of Maryland in 1892. He was re-elected in 1894, but lost the 1896 election due to a Republican majority in the Maryland General Assembly. Jones was considered several times for the Democratic Party nomination for Governor of Maryland. In 1895, Jones’ nomination was thought likely, but his ambitions were thwarted when Arthur P. Gorman threw his support to a Mr. Hurst. He was subsequently elected Mayor of Rockville in 1898 and again in 1900. He resigned in 1901 upon being elected to the state Senate. During the session of 1902 he was chairman of the Finance Committee, and in 1904 he was elected president of the Maryland Senate.
Maryland State House.
Jones took a leadership role in the construction of the State House Annex at the beginning of the twentieth century. As a state senator, Jones served on the Executive Committee of the State House Building Commission. On the Building Commission, he frequently participated in meetings regarding the funding and contracts for the State House refurbishment and construction of the State House Annex. In August 1902, the "Baltimore Sun" reported that the idea for the Annex was Jones’ and that he submitted the appropriations bill to fund the restoration and construction. Jones’ original bill requested $400,000, but at the request of the Governor and Treasury officials, he changed his request to $250,000, with the understanding that any additional money would be provided during the next legislative session. Jones was elected President of the State Senate on January 4, 1904, and gave a speech that emphasized the importance of completing construction on the State House: “So with the sunshine of prosperity, honor and usefulness upon us should we hesitate to make this house a beautiful, lasting and appropriate expression of our gratitude for, and pride in, the achievements of our people? It is with sadness that we are compelled by the necessities of the situation to vacate the old Senate Chamber, memorable in the history of the State, and in which cluster associations which strike a tender chord in the heart of every true Marylander. Let us have if restored as near as, possible to its original condition and sacredly preserve it as the holiest of all in this temple of our liberties,” (Archives of Maryland, Vol. 401, pp. 10). A major focus of Jones' speech was that the Legislature should provide the necessary funding to complete the work on the State House and that such work must maintain the original character of the building.
End of career, personal associations, death.
Jones’ term in the Senate ended with his defeat in a primary by Blair Lee in 1905. In addition to his legal practice and his political career, Jones was the director, and later president, of the Montgomery County National Bank of Rockville. Jones was a Mason and Knight of Pythias, with whom he held high offices. He also served as vice president of the Board of Visitors of the State School for the Deaf in Frederick, Maryland. Jones died April 1, 1915, in New Orleans, at the home of his daughter, Elizabeth, and son-in-law, Thomas R. Falvy. His body was brought back to Frederick and buried with his wife, Ellen.

Hypnale nepa

Hypnale nepa is a venomous pitviper species endemic to Sri Lanka. Relatively small, they are distinguished by a strongly upturned snout. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Description.
Adults grow to a total length of 30–35 cm (11¾-13¾ inches). According to Wall (1921), the maximum recorded lengths are for a male of 38.7 cm (15¼ in) and a female of 38.1 cm (15 in). According to Deraniyagala (1955), the largest specimen in the Colombo museum was 39.2 cm (15⅜ inches) in total length with a tail measuring 5.9 cm (2¼ in). In general, the tail is 13-18% of total body length. The body is moderately slender with a head that is conspicuously distinct from the neck.
This species is distinguished from "H. hypnale" by a snout that has a strongly upturned tip. This is due to an extended rostral scale, which is immediately followed by a raised wart-like hump covered with 7-14 very small scales. Also, the hemipenes have clearly visible spines.
The scalation includes 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody that are weakly keeled or smooth, 124-142 ventral scales, and 33-41 subcaudal scales.
The color pattern consists of a light brown to dark brown to pale olive ground color, flecked and mottled with darker tones. This is overlaid with a series of 17-26 dorsolateral suboval or subtriangular brown blotches that alternate or oppose each other middorsally. These blotches are 3-4 scales wide and extend down to the third scale row. The top of the head is brown and usually lacks any pattern except for a black postorbital stripe that extends to the neck.
Geographic range.
"Hypnale nepa" is found in Sri Lanka throughout forested areas, from lowland rainforest to over altitude. The type locality given is "Africa." An obvious error, this was amended to "Sri Lanka" by Hoge and Romano-Hoge (1981).

Jones Tavern

Jones Tavern is a historic tavern at 128 Main Street in Acton, Massachusetts. The building was purchased in 1964 by 'Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc.', a Massachusetts non-profit corporation with a charter "to acquire and preserve the tangible landmarks of the area historically known as Iron Work Farm", and now part of Acton. Jones Tavern is now being preserved as a historic landmark under the stewardship of Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc.
History.
The main part of the Tavern was built in 1732 as a home for Samuel Jones, Jr. and his family. By 1750, the home had been expanded to become a tavern and general store. It is believed to be the first store in Acton and holds the distinction of being the town of Acton’s longest established business. In 1845, the tavern was merged into James Tuttle’s store and operated under various names until 1950.
The Faulkner House and Jones Tavern are two historic properties in South Acton that are owned by Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc., a non-profit, historical Massachusetts corporation with a charter to study the documents and preserve the tangible landmarks connected with the village of Acton. The tavern is open on the last Sunday of each month, from May through October.

Biography.
Joachim Sauter studied design at the UdK Berlin, and studied direction and camera at the German Academy for Film and Television, Berlin. He has been using computers both as a tool and as a medium since the early stages of his work. A pioneer of new media, he has developed and shaped this field with his works from the early 1980s on. 
In 1988 he founded the new media design studio ART+COM, together with other designers, architects, technologists, and their ilk - more generally, artists and scientists. Their goal was to practically research this new upcoming medium in the realm of art and design. They have come to emphasize the translation of information (easily transmissible via new media) into physical spaces, offering a more communal, reality-grounded experience than computer monitors alone allow for. 
Joachim Sauter lives and works in Berlin.

Arthur Karney

Arthur Baillie Lumsdaine Karney (14 September 1874 – 8 December 1963) was the first Bishop of Johannesburg in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and the Church of England.
Family.
Karney was one of 10 children of the Reverend Gilbert Sparshott Karney, Rector of Emmanuel Church, Hampstead and Emma Sarah Storrs. He was educated at Haileybury and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1896.
He married Georgina Maude Bessie Fielding in Buenos Aires in 1908 and they had seven children, Peter, Anthony (Tony), Audrey. George, Rosamund, Mary (Molly) and Grace.
One of his older sisters, Evelyn, (1869–1953) founded the Talawa mission in Ceylon. 
He was ordained in the Church of England in 1897 and appointed assistant chaplain to the Missions to Seamen at Sunderland. In 1903 he was Rector of Woolpit in Suffolk in 1903. He had become fascinated in the work of seamen and was sent to work on the staff of the Seaman's Institute in San Francisco then one of the toughest assignments because of the number and state of the seamen arriving after the stormy voyage around Cape Horn. He became involved in protecting young seamen from being 'shanghaied' or 'crimped' and acquired the name of the fighting parson. The San Francisco Institute was destroyed by the earthquake in 1905. In 1906 he was Chaplain to the Missions to Seamen in Buenos Aires.
In 1914, on the outbreak of the First World War he became a chaplain in the Royal Navy firstly on a hospital ship and then with pastoral care for a whole squadron. In early 1918 he came chaplain with the 22nd Northumberland Fusiliers when they were overrun in the German March offensive and in the interests of protecting his men he was taken into captivity at the detention camp in Karlsruhe. From 1918 to 1922 he was Oxford Diocesan Missioner. In 1922 he was awarded an honorary D.D. by the University of Cambridge. 
On 25 July 1922 he was consecrated first Bishop of Johannesburg. The new cathedral (St Mary's), which bears his name on the foundation stone, was built in a poor downtown area to serve ALL the people of the Johannesburg. He spent a considerable period of his ministry seeking better conditions for the "native" population. A card bearing the words "ALL RACES WELCOME - ARTHUR + " was pinned in the cathedral and remained there for some 50 years. He also instituted services for black congregations in their own languages. In Bishop Karney's first ten years not only was the fine cathedral consecrated but 25 churches had been built. During his first five years the number of black children in diocesan schools rose from just over 5,000 to more than 9,000. In 1931 karney wrote "Alas the Native cant bargain - at least he can if he gets a great leader but he hasn’t found one yet". In that month Desmond Tutu, later to succeed Karney as Bishop of Johannesburg, was born and the young Nelson Mandela was tending cattle in the hills above Qunu in the Transkei.
He became Bishop of Southampton from 1933 to 1943, Chaplain of Marlborough College until 1944 and Rector of Blendworth until 1949.Following his retirement he lived in Lewes, Sussex until his death in 1963.
He wrote a number of books:
Two of his sons became priests. Peter was Chaplain of Trinity College, Cambridge, a naval chaplain during the war and vicar of Embleton, Northumberland. Tony was Chaplain to the Church Railway Mission in South Africa and Rector of Eythorne, Kent.

Placidus Böcken

Placidus Böcken (or Böckhn) (13 July 1690 – 9 February 1752) was a German Benedictine canon lawyer, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Salzburg.
Life.
Böcken was born in Munich, in Bavaria. He entered the Order of St. Benedict at an early age, made his religious profession at the Abbey of St. Peter, Salzburg, in 1706, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1713. Having been made a Doctor of Canon and Civil Law (1715), he was sent to Rome and on his return was chosen, in 1721, to succeed Benedict Schmier, as professor of canon law at the Benedictine University of Salzburg, where he remained for a period of twenty years.
He was also attached to the theological faculties of Salzburg and Fulda, was secretary of the university, and an ecclesiastical councillor of four successive archbishops in the See of Salzburg and of the Prince-Abbot of Fulda. Eventually he appears to have incurred the displeasure of Archbishop Leopold of Salzburg, and in consequence of repeated friction resigned his position in 1741. He was then made pastor of Dornbach, a suburb of Vienna, and, two years later, superior of Maria-Plain near Salzburg, where he spent the last nine years of his life as confessor to the many pilgrims.
Works.
The "Commentarius in Jus Canonicum universum" which Böcken published at Salzburg (1735–39), and dedicated to his friend and patron the Prince-Abbot of Fulda, is his major work. He had previously (1722–28) issued a number of separate treatises on the five books of the "Decretals"; these were updated in his larger work, to the third volume of which, in an appendix, he also added a lengthy disquisition "De praescriptionibus". A reprint of the "Commentarius" appeared at Paris in 1776. 
Theology.
Böcken held rather extreme views on the subject of the veneration due the saints. He maintained that the special veneration and invocation of the saints, particularly of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is absolutely necessary for salvation. A sermon which he preached on this subject in 1740 precipitated an acrid discussion at the university between the members of the "Old School" and the "New School" of theology, between the Sycophantae and the Illuminati as they were called. The sermon appeared also in print, with annotations wherein Böcken characterized as erroneous the contrary opinion of Muratori.

Meller, previously the firm's foreign traffic manager, assumed the presidency of Wells Fargo in 1918.
Elmer Ray Jones, who had been with Wells Fargo since 1893, purchased Wells Fargo & Company's
Express in Mexico and Wells Fargo in Cuba in 1919 for $640,000. He headed a group of men from Wells Fargo and American Express in 1924 to buy Wells Fargo & Company in the United States from the E.H. Harriman estate, making arrangements with the executors, Charles A. Peabody and Robert W. DeForest. The shares were taken by American Express (51 per cent) and the group of individuals headed by Jones (29 per cent); the remaining 20 per cent remained outstanding. In 1924 Jones was elected president of Wells Fargo, which sold its 20,000 shares in the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank, severing the final tie between the two institutions.
Jones redeveloped Wells Fargo as a concern for armored transportation and other specialized express movements. In 1947, for instance, he personally supervised the transfer of 13 tons of gold from Montreal to Mexico City by airplane. The company had a fleet of 50 armored
cars in New York City, ten stores handling farm equipment, automobiles and trucks, and (together with American Express) the largest travel agency in Mexico. It also provided fast railroad freight service through a subsidiary, the Wells Fargo Carloading Corporation.
Succeeding Jones as president of Wells Fargo were Ralph T. Reed in 1956, Howard L. Clark in 1960, R.D. Beals in 1963, and James A. Henderson in 1964. Wells Fargo continued its overseas express service until the 1960s; by the middle of the decade, its subsidiaries operated armored cars in 12 Eastern and Southern states, and the concern had entered the coin-auditing and coin-rolling business.
As an operator of armored cars, the company did business as the Wells Fargo Armored Security Corporation as an affiliate of Baker Industries, and later, after its acquisition by Borg-Warner Security, as Wells Fargo Armored Service.
Loomis Armored Inc..
Lee B. Loomis established Loomis Armored Car Service in 1925 in Portland, Oregon. The company's headquarters was moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1932. Loomis died in 1949, but Loomis Corporation remained under his family's ownership until 1979 when it was acquired by Mayne Nickless. Wingate Partners purchased Loomis in 1991, and the company was consolidated with Wells Fargo Armored Service in 1997 to form Loomis Fargo & Company.
Loomis Fargo & Company.
On July 15, 1996, Borg-Warner Security agreed to consolidate its Wells Fargo Armored Service with Loomis Armored Inc. Employing 8,500 and providing armored transportation, cash services and automated teller machine maintenance, the new concern was named Loomis Fargo & Company. The transaction was completed in 1997. 
Loomis Fargo in 1999 initiated a strategy for development as an international cash handling service leader. In 2001 it joined Securitas AB, which was founded in Helsingborg, Sweden, in 1934 by Erik Philip-Sörensen. On November 16, 2006, Securitas AB Chief Executive Officer Hakon Ericson announced the company's intention to split into several independent, specialized security companies, with its Cash Handling Servicea Division adopting the name "Loomis" throughout its international network. By the end of June 2007 the transition to the new identity had been completed, with Loomis employing 20,000 people in a network of 420 operating locations in 11 European nations and the United States. Loomis US included by that date nearly 200 operating locations with 8,000 employees (which it terms "teammates') and a fleet of 3,000 armored cars. 
In 2008, Loomis was distributed to the Securitas shareholders and listed at Nasdaq OMX Stockholm as Loomis AB.
New Loomis Fargo and Major Robberies.
During its first year of operation as the new Loomis Fargo & Company, the company was the target for two of the largest cash robberies ever committed on American soil.
In March 1997, employee Philip N. Johnson, on his own, stole $18.8 million from the Loomis Fargo armored car that he was driving. In the October 1997 "Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery", employee David Scott Ghantt and accomplices stole $17.3 million from the Loomis Fargo vault that he was supervising. The perpetrators of both robberies, and a significant majority of the cash, were found by law enforcement agencies.
These two robberies, along with the unrelated $18.9 million Dunbar Armored robbery, which also occurred in 1997, were the first to surpass the previous holder of the title "largest cash robbery" in U.S. history, the $5 million cash portion (along with $0.9 million in jewellery) of the Lufthansa heist of December 1978.
Robberies while being a division of Securitas.
The UK division of the company hit the headlines in February 2006 when armed robbers raided its cash center located in Tonbridge in Kent. The criminals made off with £53m in what is known as the Securitas depot robbery.
The next month, a Securitas van in Warrington, Cheshire was also robbed by criminals who rammed it in a stolen tractor and subsequently made off with over half a million pounds.
Again the same month, an armed gang robbed a Securitas van as it was unloading money at Gothenburg's Landvetter Airport in Sweden.
On October 4, 2007, two armored truck guards working for Loomis were killed in a robbery in Northeast Philadelphia. Another man was wounded. A bank surveillance photo showed the gunman walking up to the two guards, shooting both of them execution-style, and running off with a bag containing ATM deposit envelopes. The man later confessed to the killings.

Kazabazua, Quebec

Kazabazua is a village and municipality in La Vallée-de-la-Gatineau Regional County Municipality, Quebec, Canada. The village is about halfway between Maniwaki and Hull at the intersection of Route 105 and Route 301, just west of the Gatineau River.
The village and municipality are named after the Kazabazua River which passes through it. Like many other Amerindian names, Kazabazua has had many spellings, such as Kazaluzu, Kasubasua, Cazabasua, Cazibazouis, Cazebalzuac, Cajibajouis. This word comes from the Algonquin word "kachibadjiwan", from "kach" ("hidden") and "djiwan" ("current"), hence it means "underground river". This name is a reflection of the local topography because the Kazabazua River disappears underground and resurfaces a few dozen metres downstream. The river then flows through rapids and passes under a natural stone bridge.
The communities of Kazabazua Station, Aylwin, and Aylwin Station are also located within the municipality.
Geography.
The bedrock of the region Kazabazua is composed predominantly of marble dating from the Precambrian Era and represent metamorphic sedimentary rocks from the Grenville orogeny.
At the Kazabazua River, marble is calcitic and contains crystals of graphite and grossular garnet. The marble has been chemically and mechanically eroded by water from the river to form a karst stone bridge. The inclusion of gneiss in the marble illustrates erosion differential.
The Kazabazua Plain is a geomorphological phenomena unique to Quebec. It is made up of metamorphic rocks which are covered with a network of ancient sand dunes and bogs within which many rare plant species and threatened species have been identified. The topography is the result of water and wind action since the withdrawal of the last glacier. After this withdrawal, the region was covered by the Champlain Sea, which left a layer of marine clay. When the sea level lowered, the area was submerged under a postglacial delta which deposited large volumes of sand.
History.
This area is part of the Algonquin First Nation territory and has long been inhabited by that people. 
Circa 1835, the area began to be settled by Europeans and the community was originally called Hoganville, in memory of the first pioneers, the Hogan family, who were soon joined by the Gabie, Chamberlain, and Pritchard families.
In 1858, the Aylwin Township was formed, followed in 1862 by the township municipality with the same name. These were named after judge and politician Thomas Cushing Aylwin (1806–1871). Also in 1862, the local post office opened, named Kazubazua. As evidenced by Lovell's Gazetteer of 1873, the village itself also began to be popularly known as Kazubazua.
In 1932, the name was changed to Kazabazua and the municipality legally took this name in 1976. It is often shortened to "Kaz" by locals.

Giuseppe Coluccio

Giuseppe Coluccio (born April 12, 1966) is an Italian criminal and a member of the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type organisation in Calabria. He was a fugitive since 2005 and included in the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy until his capture on August 7, 2008, in Toronto (Canada).
Born in 'Ndrangheta family.
Coluccio was born in Marina di Gioiosa Ionica a seaside town on southern Italy's Ionian coast. He was the first of three sons born into a traditional 'Ndrangheta family. Before he reached his teens, his father was murdered in Siderno during a bloody feud that ravaged competing 'Ndrangheta clans. The clan survived and eventually rose to prominence under the leadership of Giuseppe Coluccio. The clan achieved an "unbreakable" monopoly on the sale of fish through the "power of intimidation" that was so strong the fisherman declared it a "law" that they answered to the clan, according to Italian Antimafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri in a dossier for Canadian authorities. Proceeds from the monopoly were invested in a "vast drug-trafficking operation in cocaine."
His first arrest for drug dealing and trafficking was in 1991. Since then, various investigations identified him as a key player in the import of cocaine from Colombia for a cartel of 'Ndrangheta clans in collaboration with Roberto Pannunzi, who brokered the deals in Latin America.
He was also involved in trafficking heroin from Turkey, smuggled in by fishing boats controlled by the Coluccio-Aquino 'Ndrina in Gioiosa Ionica. He is a cousin of Rocco Aquino and Giuseppe Aquino, the bosses of the Aquino 'ndrina in the town.
Fugitive.
He has been a fugitive since 2005 when he fled charges on drug trafficking in relation to an operation by the Italian police arresting 30 people (Operation Nostromo), that also included his brother Salvatore Coluccio. Leading 'Ndrangheta bosses around Toronto were told to expect the Coluccios before they even arrived. His youngest brother, Antonio Coluccio, who is not facing charges in Italy, arrived first and settled with his Canadian wife in Richmond Hill. His brothers came soon after. Coluccio entered on the powerful "Camera di controllo" – the board of control for 'Ndrangheta clans, comprising six or seven Toronto-area men, who co-ordinate activities and resolves disputes among Calabrian gangsters in Southern Ontario.
He apparently also aligned himself with members of the Sicilian Mafia, in particular with Giuseppe "Big Joe" Cuntrera, a member of the Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan operating in Canada and Venezuela and involved in large scale cocaine trafficking. Police allege Coluccio continued trafficking "substantial quantities" of cocaine and hashish from South America while he was living in Canada.
Coluccio was arrested on August 7, 2008, outside a strip mall in Markham, Ontario, north of Toronto. He stayed at The Palace Pier, a luxury condominium overlooking Lake Ontario. He had been hiding in Canada for nearly three years under a false identity and is wanted for drug related offences, charges of Mafia association and extortion. He was extradited from Canada to Italy on August 19, 2008, and incarcerated under the strict Article 41-bis prison regime.
Links with Mexican cartels.
His arrest was part of a larger law enforcement operation in the US, Mexico and Italy – known as Operation Solare or Project Reckoning in the US – against the Mexican Gulf Cartel that controls the movement of significant amounts of Colombian cocaine to the United States and Europe. The operation resulted in some 200 arrest in September 2008. Among those detained were sixteen members of the Aquino-Coluccio clan. They were identified and arrested in New York and Calabria.

Volunteer travel

Volunteer travel, volunteer vacations or voluntourism is travel which includes volunteering for a charitable cause. In recent years, "bite-sized" volunteer vacations have grown in popularity. Volunteer vacations vary widely in scope, from low-skill work cleaning up local wildlife areas to providing high-skill medical aid in a foreign country. Volunteer vacations participants are diverse but typically share a desire to “do something good” while also experiencing new places and challenges in locales they might not otherwise visit.
There are also other types of traveling that engage people with scientific research and education to promote the understanding and action necessary for a sustainable environment. Participants cover a fee that would include expenses on the different sites worldwide, and engage in projects according to their interest or location.
History.
Originally most volunteer vacations were undertaken by people with a direct connection to a particular cause and were considered more as short term, intense volunteer projects rather than vacations. Many of these organizations were long-standing international development assistance organizations which placed short-term volunteers on community development project sites.
Inception of volunteer travel can be linked to Volunteer Services Incorporated in 1958. These services and that of the U.S. Peace Corps, established in 1961 during the John F. Kennedy administration, have paved the way for volunteer travel and volunteer vacations throughout the world. However, some would argue, and with good reason, that the connection between travel and volunteering in the Modern Era can be traced back to the work of Herb Feith in Indonesia in 1951. Feith's contribution, the Volunteer Graduate Scheme, today known as Australian Volunteers International, may very well have paved the way for the connection between travel and volunteering that has evolved in the 60 years since.—During the 1960's and 1970's a movement of volunteerism and study abroad programs became popular among college age individuals. The first known volunteer travel operation began with Earthwatch in 1971. Earthwatch wanted to engage the general public in the scientific process by bringing together individual volunteers and scientists on field research projects. This grouping of scientists and volunteers provided an alternative means to funding, as well as provide a dedicated labour force for field scientists 
1990s.
During the 1990s the travel industry developed niche products and firms to provide volunteer vacations to people who had no previous experience with a cause, and to cater to the increasing number of young people taking gap years. These providers expanded the market but also drew criticism for the impact of their methods. At the same time, the first edition of "Volunteer Vacations" by Bill McMillon was published, featuring under 200 non-profit organizations which facilitated such service opportunities. According to the Travel Industry Association of America, more than 55 million Americans have participated in a volunteer vacation, and about 100 million more are considering taking one.
Volunteer base.
Volunteer tourism appeals to a wide variety of travelers, but the majority of volunteers are made up of high school and college students. Many students use these trips to boost their resumes, travel with friends, and as a way to gain world experience and see new countries. Recently there has also been an increase in baby boomer volunteers. One possible explanation for the increase is that baby boomers are transitioning into a new stage of life and their focus may shift toward finding activities that give their life new meaning. Voluntourism is therefore appealing, as it is specifically targeted at travelers who want to make a positive change in the world, while still providing a tourist experience. People generally volunteer in order to increase their international awareness, to contextualize poverty and its effects, as an education opportunity, and to help people while having a morally rewarding experience. Many believe that the trip will change the way they think when they return home. However, others are just looking to give to others and do not believe that their experience will cause them to think twice about their lives back home.
Rebecca Tiessens recent work with Canadian gap year students suggests that volunteer experiences are becoming viewed as a commodity that can be bought for a price for use in future college or job applications. She also suggests a correlation between conspicuous consumption and volunteer work. People may do what they perceive as good deeds primarily for the recognition of their peers rather than out of good will.
Vacations have been hit hard by the recession. However, voluntourism has remained stable because it offers individuals the opportunity to take a guilt free vacation. As criticism for excessive, lavish spending increased, volunteer vacations have become an attractive option. As many volunteer vacations include tourist activities at the end of the trip, these vacations provide volunteers with an enjoyable vacation that has an enhanced value. Families participating in volunteer vacations may feel better about spending money on their trip while still enjoying the bonding time vacations provide.
A survey by CheapTickets.com of 430 US adults 18 and older found that half of their respondents would consider voluntourism for their next vacation. In addition, 55% of respondents would consider adding volunteer activities to an already planned vacation. While 48% had heard about volunteer vacations, only 5% of applicants had actually participated in one.
Controversy.
While some experts on volunteering welcome the expansion of volunteer vacations as an opportunity to provide more resources to projects and to encourage a volunteer ethic in people, others have pointed out that the business methods used by tour operators, such as exclusivity deals, and catering to the needs of the volunteer rather than the volunteer project, exploit the communities the projects are intended to help. In many different provinces in these third world countries where voluntourism is most prominent, orphanages often take children out into the main city where they play in the streets with one another or play instruments, in an attempt to garner donations from tourists and volunteers. Many also invite potential and actual donors to visit the orphanage itself, and many then ask them to volunteer there. What these donors do not know, is that orphanages network themselves with volunteer organizations to ensure a steady flow of money and volunteers to their organizations. In addition, in order to ensure that such funding is never reduced and to promote additional donations, some orphanages are deliberately kept in decrepit conditions despite having adequate resources for dramatic improvements. Some news organizations have done inside reports on the volunteer industry finding exploitation.
Economic effects on host countries.
Claims by volunteer tourism organizations that these activities contribute to improving people's lives and contributing to development goals are yet to be evaluated in the vast majority of cases. It is true that many countries have greatly benefited from the influx of tourism. Local economies and businesses have benefited as volunteers stay in their hotels, eat at their local restaurants, unwind at local bars, and stroll the local markets. However, it is possible that volunteer travel might exacerbate existing problems in the host community. Dr Anna Mdee of Voluntourism.org contends that while there is still a lack of understanding of the direct impact volunteering overseas has on development activities, there is a much larger value that can be gained from working and living in another culture. Such value is often gained by the volunteer individually. However, short term volunteer vacations may serve to strengthen the ‘us and them’ dichotomy instead of acting to bring people from different backgrounds together. While solidarity between the volunteers and recipients is part of the goal, the actuality may be that volunteers see a deeper divide between themselves and those they helped. In addition, voluntourism may help reinforce stereotypes and preconceived ideas rather than providing a deeper understanding of other cultures. This is especially likely to occur if volunteers lack knowledge about the country in which they are volunteering, and about how the policies and history of said country have affected poverty or development. In order to make a genuine change, it is essential that volunteers are qualified and reasonably well-informed.
Social and psychological effects on the orphans.
A Human Sciences Research Council report suggests that voluntourism companies treat orphans like commodities and that the projects can create "adverse emotional and psychological effects" on the children.
Abuse at orphanages.
At the beginning of 2011, the government of Cambodia began inspecting orphanages, almost all of which are privately operated and funded, due to claims that many orphans in fact had at least one living parent. More than 250 orphanages are under review after one study found that only 28% of the 12,000 children in these orphanages had actually lost both parents. UNICEF has publically expressed concern as the number of orphans has doubled in the past five years. Coincidentally, trips to orphanages have proven to be one of the most popular, and best-selling, volunteer vacations. In fact, “the rate of growth in the number of Cambodia’s orphanages over the past five years matches the increase in the number of tourists visiting the country during that same period.” In Ghana, a government study found that almost 90% of orphans had at least one parent and that only 5% of orphanages were licensed. UNICEF estimates that less than one-third of the money orphanages receive, through both income and donations, actually goes to child care.
Sustainability.
Much of the conflict regarding volunteer tourism is that these trips are not sustainable. There will always be groups who want to partner with international organizations and individuals who desire to spend their free time helping others, but the trips and projects these people choose should focus on development that both involves the locals directly and caters to their most important needs. Volunteer trips that benefit communities through the construction of new facilities and community spaces may or may not involve the help of locals. Those that do not prevent local workers from getting much-needed jobs and those that bring their own resources fail to support the local businesses and economy. Sustainability is especially important in cases where projects are initiated by volunteers and left in the hands of locals to finish. Volunteer groups should be certain before beginning a project that there is enough funding and support for the project to be completed once they leave, in order to avoid letting their hard work waste away as a pile of rubble or their supplies sit in storage unused.
For example, voluntourism blogger Alexia Nestora found a village in Kenya that had been significantly impacted by voluntourism. This village had approximately 500 residents and as a community had built a school and furnished it with the necessities, such as individual classrooms and blackboards. The village was using this schoolhouse when a well-funded NGO came in and decided to build the community a larger school, complete with a very expensive commercial kitchen. Volunteers flew in and the NGO purchased expensive building materials and built the second school right next to the first. The community then decided to use the second schoolhouse as their school, and now they use their original schoolhouse for storage. A second group then came in to build a third school and they began construction right next to the second school. However, they ran out of funding before it was even time to build walls and have not been back to complete their work. Talking to the locals in the village revealed that they never wanted a second, much less a third, school and had no need or desire for an expensive commercial kitchen. However, they could have benefited from new teachers or an additional source of funding in order to pay teachers already on staff. Many other villages in Kenya lack adequate structures for schooling and would have welcomed the help of these NGO and volunteer groups had they offered to build a school for them. In many projects like this one, NGO and volunteer organizations often overlook one of the most important steps – talking to the locals and asking what they need.

6th Airborne Division in Palestine

The 6th Airborne Division in Palestine was initially posted to the region as the Imperial Strategic Reserve. It was envisioned as a mobile peace keeping force, positioned to be able to respond quickly to any area of the British Empire. In fact it became involved in an internal security role between 1945 and 1948.
Palestine had been a British Mandate since the end of the First World War. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was responsible for the government and security of the country. It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However Arab resistance and the Second World War prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities.
When the 6th Airborne Division arrived in response to increasing terrorist activity, it became involved in internal security, being responsible for cordons and search operations, guarding convoys and key installations. As the situation worsened, the men of the division had to patrol the towns and cities, enforce curfews and deal with rioting by the civilian population. They also protected Jewish and Arab settlements from sectarian violence. This was not without loss to the division and several members were killed and wounded during this time.
The end of the British mandate coincided with the post war reduction of the British Army back to peace time levels, and the division's numbers were gradually reduced. By the end of their tenure in Palestine, the division's strength was reduced in real terms, to less than brigade size. In 1948 it was disbanded soon after its withdrawal from Palestine.
Background.
It was during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War that a British Army, known as the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, first arrived in Palestine. The British Empire forces, commanded by General Edmund Allenby, defeated the occupying Turkish Army and ended 400 years of rule by the Ottoman Empire.
Around the same time, the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote a letter to Baron Rothschild which has since became known as the Balfour Declaration of 1917. The letter stated: "His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."
Mandate.
In July 1922, the British Mandate of Palestine was created. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was responsible for the government and defence of the country and for the establishment of a Jewish homeland. Then in September 1922, the League of Nations and Great Britain decided that any Jewish homeland would not be formed in the land to the east of the River Jordan. This instead became a separate country known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, mainly from Europe, came to settle in Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab resistance and violence to this influx of immigrants came to a head in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May 1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.
By the end of 1945, Jewish immigration had almost reached the 75,000 White Paper limit. Arab concerns led to the British putting further restrictions on immigration. Even when the scale of the Holocaust became known, the British stance remained the same. This led to an inevitable confrontation between the British authorities, illegal Jewish immigrants, and militant Zionist groups. It became a widespread belief within the Jewish community that the British were practising antisemitism and were no different from Nazi Germany. However, between 1945 and 1948 a further 85,000 Jewish immigrants, mostly survivors of the Holocaust, entered the country illegally.
Jewish resistance movements.
During this time the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, comprising several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.
When Axis forces posed a threat to the Middle East in the Second World War, the Haganah organized a full-time, elite force, the Palmach. By 1947, this organization numbered around 2,200 members. Palmach members were subject to military discipline; many of them had served in the British forces during the war.
In 1937, a splinter group was formed by those not happy with the Hagana methods. This group was called the National Military Organization in the Land of Israel or Irgun in short. It launched a campaign of violence against the government in 1944, carrying out several terrorist attacks. By 1945, Irgun had an estimated membership of 1,500. A third group was the Lehi, the Hebrew acronym of "Fighters for the Freedom of Israel", known in the British press as the Stern Gang. Lehi membership consisted of only around fifty men. It was the only Jewish group that contemplated working with the Italians and Germans during the war, and afterwards assassinated members of the British authorities. By 1946, both the Irgun and Lehi had declared war on Great Britain.
British 6th Airborne Division.
Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division was one of only two British airborne divisions raised during the Second World War. Before being deployed to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings and the Battle of the Bulge. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.
At the end of the war in Europe, it had been planned to send the division to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire.
By September 1945, the division was en route to the region for airborne training. However, conditions in Palestine were deteriorating. By the time the division arrived, instead of training, it was deployed on internal security.
During the Second World War, the division comprised the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades and the glider infantry 6th Airlanding Brigade. However the 5th Parachute Brigade had been sent to India ahead of the rest of the division. So when the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength. In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6th Airlanding Brigade. In August 1946, the 5th Parachute Brigade returned from the Far East, and joined the division, but was disbanded soon afterwards. The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2nd Parachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.
Operations.
1945.
Still commanded by its last wartime commander, Major General Eric Bols, the division began deployment to Palestine in 1945. The advance party arrived on 15 September, followed by the Tactical Headquarters on 24 September, then the 3rd Parachute Brigade on 3 October, the 6th Airlanding Brigade on 10 October and the 2nd Parachute Brigade on 22 October. After arriving by sea at Haifa, the newly arrived troops were sent to camps in the Gaza Subdistrict to acclimatize to the conditions, and to regain their fitness after the long sea journey from England. By the end of the month divisional headquarters was established at Bir Salim. The 2nd Parachute Brigade at remained at Gaza, the 3rd Parachute Brigade moved to the Tel Aviv and Jaffa region, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade moved to Samaria.
It was not long before the division became involved in operations, enforcing a night time curfew at the end of October after the railway in the divisional area was sabotaged. On 13 November the British Government confirmed they would examine the conditions of Jews in Europe and consult the Arabs to ensure Jewish immigration, at the time around 1,500 persons a month, was not hindered.
Unhappy that the announcement did not go far enough, the Jewish National Council arranged a twelve hour strike for the next day. Rioting started in Tel Aviv and the Jewish part of Jerusalem, which resulted in the 3rd Parachute Brigade being deployed to patrol the streets for the following five days.
The first operation involving the 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over the night of 24/25 November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26 November, the police were involved in hand to hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon to hold back the estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges and for the first time used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.
Near the end of the year, over the night of 26/27 December, several attacks were carried out by the Irgun on police stations, Palestine Railways installations and one British Army armoury. The 3rd Parachute Brigade again enforced a night time curfew on Tel Aviv. Then on 29 December, it took part in Operation Pintail, the search of Ramat Gan, for Irgun members involved in the attacks. The brigade questioned the 1,500 inhabitants, arresting eighty-nine.
1946.
The first mission of 1946 was Operation Hebron on 8 January. This time the objective was the cordon and search of the town of Rishon LeZion by the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the police, during which fifty-five suspects were taken into custody. For the rest of the month, the brigade was involved in several smaller operations. In Operation Pigeon on 30 January, they searched the Shapira district of Tel Aviv.
On 5 March Major General James Cassels took over command of the division. The next action involving the division was over the night of 2/3 April, when units of the Irgun attacked railway installations in the divisional area. While one attack on the Yibna railway station and police post was in progress, a mobile patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion arrived, detonating a mine while crossing a bridge. Three of the patrol were wounded, but the others took off after the saboteurs. Reinforcements arrived from the 5th and 6th Parachute Battalions. In the morning, tracks of around thirty men were discovered leading away from the area. A spotter plane later located the men and directed a section of the 8th Parachute Battalion to intercept them. After a small battle, fourteen of the saboteurs were wounded and twenty-six prisoners taken.
In March the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division. The 6th Airlanding Brigade left the division on 13 April, but remained in Palestine as the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade. This reduced the division's manpower by around twenty-five per cent as the strength of the airlanding brigade had been almost equal to that of two parachute brigades combined.
At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi carried out an attack on a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, established a fire base in a house overlooking the car park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.
This was the first deliberate attack by any group targeting the British Army, which had not established defences against any form of assault. During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00. However this was not enough for some members of the division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.
Attacks on the security services had increased to a level that on 19 June all ranks were ordered to be armed at all times on or off duty, and to travel in pairs during the day and in threes at night. Near the end of June the division received orders for Operation Agatha, the arrest of Jewish leaders "suspected of condoning" or being involved in sabotage or murder of civil and military personnel. Agatha was a nationwide operation involving not only the 6th Airborne Division but the Palestinian Police Force and all other army units in the country. Secondary objectives were to gather intelligence and arrest any members of the Palmach that could be found.
Operation Agatha started at 04:15 on 29 June. The 2nd Parachute Brigade was responsible for Tel Aviv, the 1st Parachute Brigade for Jewish settlements around Ma'abarot and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for those around Givat Brenner. The operation ended on 1 July after 2,718 suspects had been arrested. Many had no connection to the resistance movements and were instead arrested for harassing the searchers or for refusing to give their names when asked. The 6th Airborne Division alone arrested 636 persons, 135 of them for being suspected Palmach members and ten were Jewish leaders.
The next major incident was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters located in the King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in to take charge of the search for survivors and secure the part of the building left standing. Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety-one victims. To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23 July.
The British response to the bombing came on 30 July, when the division carried out Operation Shark. Believing that the bombers were being sheltered in Tel Aviv, every dwelling and building was searched for members of the Lehi and Irgun, and the population questioned. During the operation, a cordon surrounded the city and a curfew was imposed on its inhabitants. To allow the population to buy food and other essentials, the curfew was lifted for two hours every second day, until the end of the operation. The division's three parachute brigades were each given one quarter of the city to cordon and search while the fourth quarter was the responsibility of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, attached to the division for the operation. Over four days each brigade questioned around 100,000 people, and 787 were detained for further questioning. During the searches, five arms dumps were found, containing four machine guns, twenty-three mortars, 176 rifles and pistols, and 127,000 round of ammunition. Also found were £50,000 of forged bearer bonds, forging equipment and a large amount of explosives.
The division's next operations were Bream and Eel, searching for arms in Dorot and Ruhama, by the 3rd and 8th Parachute Battalions, and the 9th Airborne Squadron Royal Engineers. The two villages were cordoned at dawn on 28 August. Over the next six days the settlements were searched, during which a large quantity of assorted weapons, including heavy machine guns and mortars, were found.
Over the remaining months of the year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks, which were being mined. Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued to blow the mines up rather than disarm them. Then on 2 December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).
A change in command occurred on 13 December when Major General Cassels left the division and was replaced by Eric Bols, now commanding the division for the second time.
1947.
Between 29 December 1946 and 3 January the division's brigades carried out seven search operations in Tel Aviv, arresting 191 people. On 2 January several attacks were made on roads in the division's area. One attack wounded eight men of the 4th and 5th Parachute Battalions. Another attack on the same day was carried out by the Lehi against the 1st Parachute Battalion headquarters in Tel Aviv, killing a Jewish policeman and wounding two soldiers and another police officer. Then on 18 January the 6th Airborne and 1st Infantry Division swapped locations, the airborne division now assuming responsibility for the north of the country. Although it remained part of the division, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was withdrawn to England on 24 January.
Upon their arrival in the north, the 1st Parachute Brigade assumed responsibility for the District of Galilee, and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for the District of Haifa, with division headquarters located in the Stella Maris Monastery. The 1st Parachute Brigade also took under its command the Transjordan Frontier Force and a battalion of the Arab Legion to cover their large area. In the north the division was mainly responsible for the security of the port of Haifa, the largest in the country, where they protected oil installations, the Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline and prevented illegal immigrants from landing on the coastline. On 31 January it was announced that all non-essential British civilians were to be evacuated, due to the worsening situation. The evacuation took place from Haifa between 5 and 8 February, under the control of the 8th Parachute Battalion and the Royal Navy.
On 4 May a group of around forty men carried out the Acre Prison break, releasing forty-one Jews and 214 Arabs. At the same time a mortar attack was carried out on the 2nd Parachute Battalion's camp, as a diversion. The first unit to reach the prison was a platoon from the 1st Parachute Battalion, 35 minutes later. Other men from the battalion and some divisional units were bathing in the sea a short distance from the prison. A truck load of escaping prisoners opened fire on one unit's armoured car. The escaping truck then reached an improvised road block set up by some bathers and crashed under fire. The division's bathing party killed four attackers, four Jewish and one Arab escapee, and recaptured thirteen Jews. The bathers had eight men wounded during the short battle. While this was going on, the 1st Parachute Brigade was establishing a cordon around Acre and the surrounding area but no further escapees were caught.
The next attack was on officers from the 9th Parachute Battalion on 28 June. The officers were dining at a restaurant when two men of the Irgun approached and fired machine guns through the windows. One officer was killed outright while several others were wounded. The officers returned fire and the car the gunmen were escaping in crashed; later examination revealed at least one of them had been wounded. On 19 July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were shot in the back and killed. The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew, which was not lifted until 30 July.
Leadership of the division changed again on 19 August, when Major General Hugh Stockwell was given command. In October the British War Office announced the division would be reduced by one brigade. The 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded, leaving the 1st Parachute Brigade in Palestine and the 2nd Parachute Brigade in England. The 1st Parachute Brigade assumed responsibility for Haifa and to cover all its commitments the 2nd Battalion Middlesex Regiment was attached to the brigade.
At a meeting on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1 August 1948. Palestine would be partitioned into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. The Jewish state would have fifty-six per cent of the land with a population of 490,000 Jews and 325,000 Arabs, while the Arab state would have 807,000 Arabs, but only 10,000 Jews. The population of Jerusalem would be around 105,000 Arabs to 100,000 Jews.
On 13 December trouble came from another quarter, in the town of Safed, opposite the Golan Heights. Fighting had started between the Arab and Jewish inhabitants. The police requested help from the army and a company from the 8th Parachute Battalion was assigned the task. Arabs fired at the British unit on 21 December without causing any injuries.
1948.
Tension in the Golan Heights area remained high and on 9 January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar Szold were attacked by Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who crossed the border from Syria. The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.
To assist in controlling the region, an ad-hoc formation called Craforce was established. Under the command of the division's commander, Royal Artillery Brigadier C. H. Colquhoun, were the division's artillery, the 17th/21st Lancers, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Battalion Irish Guards. Craforce became involved with breaking up attacks between Arab and Jewish forces. The Arabs did not directly attack the British, but did engage them when British attempted to intervene in an attack on Jewish settlements.
In February the Arab Liberation Army, under the command of Fawzi al-Qawuqji, was estimated to be around 10,000 strong. It was believed around 1,000 volunteers from neighbouring Arab states joined each month.
On 18 February it was announced that the 6th Airborne Division would be disbanded when they left Palestine. The 1st Parachute Brigade handed over Haifa to the 1st Guards Brigade on 6 April. Gradually the division's units left the country. The division's last units, comprising part of divisional headquarters, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Airborne Squadron Royal Engineers, departed on 18 May.
Aftermath.
Since the end of the Second World War, the campaign in the British Mandate of Palestine had cost the British 338 dead. The numbers for the 6th Airborne Division between October 1945 and April 1948 were fifty-eight men dead and 236 wounded due to enemy action, a further ninety-nine men died, from causes not associated with a hostile act. During their searches of Jewish and Arab settlements, men from the division had located 99 mortars, 34 machine guns, 174 sub machine guns, 375 rifles, 391 pistols, 97 land mines, 2,582 hand grenades and 302,530 rounds of ammunition.
In February 1948 the 2nd Parachute Brigade moved from England to Germany, becoming part of the British Army on the Rhine. The 6th Airborne Division was disbanded in April 1948, shortly after their return to England, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only brigade-sized airborne formation in the British Army. Being the only surviving parachute formation, in June its battalions were renumbered: the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, while the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion became the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion became the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment. Finally, in July 1948, the brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade, taking the numbers "1" and "6" from the two wartime airborne divisions.
On 14 May, the day before the end of the British mandate, David Ben-Gurion, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, announced the establishment of the state of Israel in parts of what was known as the British Mandate of Palestine. The announcement was the catalyst for the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The infant state of Israel had, by the end of the war, mobilised around 100,000 soldiers forming twelve brigades and fledgling naval and air forces. These forces defeated the combined armies of five Arab states, forcing the majority of them back out of Israeli territory.

La Puerta del Cielo / Seven Lives

"La Puerta del Cielo / Seven Lives" is the first single from Enigma's seventh album "Seven Lives Many Faces". The track "Seven Lives" had been featured on German TV as the signature theme to the public broadcaster EinsFestival's coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The single was digitally released in Germany on 8 August and physically on 15 August. The single reached top 50 in Germany and remained in the top 100 for several weeks.
The title of the song "La Puerta del Cielo" (The Gate of Heaven) is in Spanish but its lyrics are in the Balearic dialect of Catalan: "Allà dins es canal / En es peu da sa muntanya". Both album tracks co-written by Roig – the other being "Between Generations" – have Catalan words.

Beit

A Beit (also spelled bait, Arabic, literally "a house") is a metrical unit of Arabic, Iranian, Urdu and Sindhi poetry. It corresponds to a line, though sometimes improperly renderered as "couplet" since each "beit" is divided into two hemistichs of equal length, each containing two, three or four feet, or from 16 to 32 sylables.
William Alexander Clouston concluded that this fundamental part of Arabic prosody originated with the Bedouins or Arabs of the desert, as, in the nomenclature of the different parts of the line, one foot is called "a tent-pole", another "tent-peg" and the two hemistichs of the verse are called after the folds or leaves of the double-door of the tent or "house".

Onward ticket

An onward ticket is a proof of a booked train or airline ticket originating from the country about to be entered.
An onward ticket reflects any of these:
When required.
An onward ticket can be required, based on the countries' entry requirements (which may or may not include the onward ticket). Many (usually poorer) countries insist a flight ticket be held out from their country, which must be presented upon arrival at immigration. They set this requirement, so that if travellers run out of money, the country is certain that the traveller will depart. In the past, travellers would remain in a country supporting themselves by illicit employment. Without an onward ticket, a traveller may be refused entry to these countries and subsequently placed on the next plane for the destination from where he arrived.
However, there are also many states that do not operate this policy and are less strict in the application of the law of the countries' customs. To determine which do and do not, guide books, websites of the own Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the relevant embassies and/or other sources may be used.

Football career.
Born in Villar del Arzobispo, Valencian Community, Verdés was a product of Valencia CF's youth system. After unsuccessfully appearing for the club as a senior (never made it past the B-team in three full seasons), Verdés served a loan with Xerez CD in the second division, appearing in exactly half of the matches as the Andalusian club finished in 15th position; in the 2008 summer, he was released by the "Che".
For the 2008–09 campaign Verdés moved to the third level, playing under young manager Luis Enrique at FC Barcelona B. However, after only one year, he returned to Valencia, spending an additional season with the reserve squad – also in division three – which ended in relegation.
Verdés signed for Elche CF, also in his native region and the second division, in July 2010. After three seasons of irregular playing time, featuring in 24 games in the first one and just 21 in the following two combined, mainly due to injuries, he moved to fellow league club AD Alcorcón.

Pietro Delfino

Pietro Delfino, O.S.B. Cam., (born at Venice in 1444; died 16 January 1525) was an Italian Camaldolese monk, patristic scholar, theologian, abbot, and Superior General of his religious Order.
Life.
Delfino entered the Camaldolese Monastery of St. Michael, which was located on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. In 1479, he was elected abbot of the same community. The following year he was made prior general of the Order, based at Camaldoli in the region of Arezzo. He held that office until the year 1513 when he resigned in favour of Paul Giustiniani, whom he had invested with the Camaldolese habit in 1510. 
Delfino was the forty-sixth prior general from St. Romuald, the founder of the Camaldolese, and he was the last elected for life--the office after him being held for three years only. In 1488, he received the votes of his countrymen in Venice for the cardinalate, but refused to accept this dignity from Pope Innocent VIII. 
Works.
The letters of Delfino, which number more than 4,000, addressed to different religious of his own and other orders and to various secular dignitaries, contain accounts of contemporary events in his own Order and the Church in general. A collection of his Latin letters was published at Venice in 1524. Several others that had been omitted in the Venetian editions were included later in Martène's "Veterum Scriptorum amplissima collectio". The "Apothegmata Patrum" and the "Dialogues" on Savonarola are still unedited.

Beam lead technology

Beam lead technology is a method of fabricating a semiconductor device. Its original application was to high-frequency silicon switching transistors and high-speed integrated circuits. It eliminated the labor-intensive wire-bonding process used for integrated circuits at the time, and allowed automated assembly of semiconductor chips onto larger substrates to produce hybrid integrated circuits. 
History.
In the early 1960s, M.P. Lepselter developed the techniques for fabricating a structure consisting of electroforming an array of thick, self-supporting gold patterns on a thin film Ti-Pt Au base, hence the name "beams", deposited on the surface of a silicon wafer. The excess semiconductor from under the beams was removed, thereby separating the individual devices and leaving them with self-supporting beam leads or internal chiplets cantilevered beyond the semiconductor. The contacts served as electrical leads in addition to also serving the purpose of structural support for the devices.
Patents.
Patented inventions included:
Legacy.
This technology, also known as air-bridge technology, has established itself for its unsurpassed reliability in high-frequency silicon switching transistors and ultra-high-speed integrated circuits for telecommunications and missile systems. The Beam Lead devices, produced by the hundreds of millions, became the first example of a commercial microelectromechanical structure (MEMS).

Sandhill Park

Sandhill Park in Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, England is a derelict country house built in about 1720. It was used in the 20th century as a prisoner of war camp, a home for handicapped children and later as a military and civilian hospital.
It was built in 1720 by John Periam, the Member of Parliament for Minehead, and named "Hill House". It was afterwards lived in by the Lethbridge family from 1767 to 1913.
During World War I it was used as a prisoner of war camp for German and Austrian Officers. In 1919 it was converted by Somerset County Council into a home for handicapped children.
It was requisitioned by the military in August 1940 and became the 41st General Military Hospital, providing accommodation in tents and huts. From 1941 the hospital was leased to the Americans as a neurological hospital for over 1,000 patients in 32 new wards which were completed in 1942 serving as the 185th General Hospital. The hospital remained in military use until 1944. The psychiatric hospital reopened under the National Health Service in 1948 and further buildings were constructed.
The hospital was sold in 1991 and housing built on part of the area. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage.
The derelict building was badly damaged by fire on November 22 2011, which was caused by arson. The east wing gutted along with more modern additions to the rear. The main house suffered extensive damage, the roof and top floor being lost and significant secondary damage caused by fire water. The west wing and orangery appear to have been untouched by the fire.

Peter Fuchs

Peter Fuchs (1829–1889) was a German sculptor.
Biography.
From 1844 to 1849 Peter Fuchs was an apprentice mason in the Cologne Dombauhütte and for the next two years he worked as a mason for St. Nicolai in Hamburg and in the studio of Vincenz Statz in Cologne.
From 1851 to 1854 he worked in Speyer with the sculptor Gottfried Renn (1818–1880) and in Frankfurt am Main with Eduard Schmidt von der Launitz (1797–1869) and Eduard Jakob von Steinle.
In 1855 Peter Fuchs returned to Cologne, where he created such large sandstone reliefs and statue groups as the Four Prophets (1858) for the Mariensäule in the Gereonsdriesch and the life-size figures of SS Dionysius and Reinold (1866–1871) for the west front of St. Mauritius. 
From 1865 to 1881 he produced some 700 life-size and slightly over-life-size sculptures for Cologne Cathedral, mostly reliefs and seated and standing figures depicting scenes from the Bible and lives of the saints. Many of these are to be found on the columns and walls of the south transept (1866–1872), the west towers (1871), the west front and the north front (1879–1881) and the Petersportal (1881). Several preliminary drawings (1879–1880) for uncompleted sculptures are located in the Dombauarchiv.
Influenced by the Nazarenes, after 1870 Peter Fuchs lengthened his figures and encased them in garments with sharp-edged, graphic folds. He was also influenced by the work of contemporary German sculptors working in the monumental style, as can be seen in the rendering of naturalistic heads and pathetic expression and in the isolation of the figures from each other. The reliefs and statues of Old and New Testament prophets (1895–1898) from the tympanum and the bronze doors of the west front of Bremen Cathedral, with their attenuated stances and pronounced folds of drapery, show his debt to the figures in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise (Florence, Mus. Opera Duomo) and to the sculptures of the Beuron Art School of the last third of the 19th century.

Telephone access of Guantanamo Bay detainees

After the United States established the Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba, officials occasionally allowed Guantanamo captives' phone calls to their family.
In 2008 the Joint Task Force Guantanamo that manages the camps developed rules regarding phone calls: all detainees who met certain conditions were allowed to make one call home per year.
On September 29 2009, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that Guantanamo captives and their families would be allowed to communicate through a two-way video link.
Since May 2008, a similar facility has been available to captives held in extrajudicial detention in Bagram Theater Internment Facility. This facility has been available to American GIs for many years.
The first video call was made between a Pakistani captive and his family. His family traveled to the ICRC's Peshawar office, where one end of the video link had been set up.
Phone calls for detainees.
While some phone calls to families had been allowed at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in 2008 the Joint Military Task Force developed policy and procedures to allow all detainees who satisfied certain conditions to make one phone call annually. Facilities were upgraded and in 2009, the Red Cross assisted with setting up video calls to its centers overseas.
Suzanne Lachelier, the officer who had been authorized to coordinate the call, said she was surprised to read newspaper reports that the call had taken place. She said she had not begun to make the arrangements. Storun later sent a retraction to reporters, without explanation of the error.

John Cobb Cooper

John Cobb Cooper, Jr. (September 18, 1887 – July 22, 1967) was an American jurist, airline executive and presidential advisor.
John Cooper Jr. was born in Jacksonville, Florida to John Cobb and Mary Coldwell Cooper. After graduating from Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, he was educated at Princeton University and received an A.B. in 1909. In 1911 was admitted to the Florida Bar. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1916 and 1924. In 1917 he joined the U.S. Navy, and would reach the rank of lieutenant by the end of World War I. He was married to Martha Helen Marvel in 1918 and the couple had three children: two girls and a boy. A year later he was relieved from active service and became a member of the Naval Reserve. In 1921 his rank became Lieutenant-Commander.
From 1927–34 he was Editor-in-Chief of the Florida State Bar Association Law Journal. He was appointed to the International Technical Committee of Legal Aerial Experts, 1932–34. He became Vice President of Pan American Airways 1934–45, serving on the board of directors 1944–46. In 1947 he served as a consultant to the U.S. President's Air Policy Commission. He was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, 1945–50. In 1951, Cooper founded the Institute of Air & Space Law at McGill University in Montreal, which had become the home of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body charged with safety in air navigation. In 1952 he was awarded his LL.D. from McGill University. From 1951–57 he was professor of International Air Law at McGill University, becoming the first director of the Institute of International Air Law, after which he was named Professor Emeritus.
He was the author of the book "The Right to Fly" and pioneered legal thought on air/space rights of man-made satellites in orbit, commencing with the launch of Sputnik in October 1957 when asked by President Eisenhower to render a legal opinion on "flyover rights" when Sputnik was orbiting over the United States. His honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Princeton University, declared him the "Father of Air Space Law".
He was the legal counsel to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) from the early 1950s through to the end of his life. 
He was a pioneer in the field of international law as it applied to air and space. He wrote the first article on the topic of space ownership, "High Altitude Flight and National Sovereignty," in 1951. 
His younger brother was movie producer Merian C. Cooper, perhaps most famous for the creation of the movie "King Kong" in 1933, and whose position as a Director of Pan Am was responsible for recommending his older brother for the position of Pan Am's legal counsel and Vice President.
He flew with Charles Lindbergh, a consultant for PanAm, in small aircraft on site surveys to select sites in Ireland (Shannon) and France (Orly) for airports as Pan Am's services overseas increased.

Mozart symphonies of spurious or doubtful authenticity

This list of Mozart symphonies of spurious or doubtful authenticity contains 39 symphonic works where an initial attribution to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has subsequently been proved spurious, or is the subject of continuing doubt. The number of symphonies actually written by Mozart is imprecisely known; of the 41 formally numbered, three (Nos 2, 3 and 37) are established as by other composers and another, No. 11, is considered by scholars to be of uncertain authorship. Outside the accepted sequence 1–41, however, there are around twenty other genuine Mozart symphonies, and beyond these, a larger number of problematic works which have not been authenticated as Mozart's. Some of these may be genuine; dubious works are often treated as authentic by the compilers of collected editions—eight are in the 1991 "Neue Mozart-Ausgabe" (NMA: English "New Mozart Edition"). Some, however, have long been accepted as the works of other composers, who in many instances have been positively identified.
Many of the authentication difficulties arise from early Mozart symphonies, where original autograph scores are missing. In some instances the main body of the work has been entirely lost, its identity being preserved only through an incipit (record of the opening few bars) cataloged by Breitkopf & Härtel, who published the "Alte Mozart-Ausgabe" (AMA) in 1883. The informal 18th century methods of publishing and distributing musical works caused additional confusion. Cataloging errors based on inadequate information, and an occasional over-eagerness to attribute new discoveries to Mozart has added to the problem. However, the "spurious and doubtful" list of symphonies is not fixed, as new evidence can sometimes lead to authentication; it can also throw doubt upon, or disqualify, symphonies once generally accepted as genuine Mozart.
Reasons for misattribution.
There are numerous reasons why symphonic works have been misattributed to Mozart. For example:
Köchel catalogue: explanation.
The Köchel catalogue, generally accepted as the definitive listing of Mozart's works, was published by Ludwig von Köchel in 1862, and has been revised and updated on several subsequent occasions. The original catalogue, known as K1, listed incomplete or lost works in an appendix or "Anhang", without regard to chronological order. These works were identified by an "Anh.", not a "K" number. In the last major revision of the catalogue (1964, K6), the Anhang was extended to include doubtful and spurious works. On the basis of the most recent research and discoveries, some of the old K1 Anhangs were promoted to "K" status, while others were relegated from the main catalogue into the K6 Anhang. However, as Zaslaw points out, the Köchel catalogue allocations between main listing and Anhang are not reliable indicators of authenticity or otherwise. Zaslaw deems some of the divisions "arbitrary", and calls for "clearer, more honest categories" for the problematic works.
"Deest" is used to identify works that have not been included in any of the Köchel catalogue versions, but which have at some stage in the past been thought of as Mozart compositions.

The town is located five kilometres from the Danube, along the main road from Rousse to Silistra. As of December 2009, it has a population of 3,169 inhabitants.
Slivo Pole was proclaimed a town on 29 November 2002. Tatars had settled in the area following the Crimean War (1853–1856), as well as Bulgarians from Rousse and from Romania after 1863. The village was known as "Islepol" and "Slepovo" and was officially named "Slivo Pole" ("plum field") in 1912, as it was called so by the travellers who would stay in the local inn which had a big plum orchard.
Municipality.
Slivo Pole municipality covers an area of 276 square kilometres and includes the following 11 places:
The municipality has a relative Bulgarian majority at 44%, with Turks ranking second at 32% and the remainder being composed of Romani (18%) and Bulgarian Muslims (6%).
A notable sight in the area (partially in Slivo Pole municipality, mostly in Tutrakan municipality, Silistra Province) is the Kalimok-Brashlen protected area which includes several Danubian islands (Mishka, Malak Brashlen, Golyam Brashlen, Pyasachnik, Bezimenen, Kalimok, Radetski and Tutrakan) and is an internationally important bird area with many endangered species.

Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon

(Alexander) Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon (20 March 1902−29 January 1977) was a British Labour politician. 
He was the son of Lt-Col. the Hon. Harold Henderson and grew up in Shellingford. Henderson was sent to Eton College, then attended McGill University in Montreal, before graduating from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1924.
Described by David Cargill as a "roaring pansy", Henderson was known for his effeminate demeanour, once opening a speech in the House of Lords with the words 'My dears' instead of 'My Lords.' His marriage, to the Hon. Honor Chedworth Philipps (the daughter of Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant), lasted only four years (consecrated in 1927; annulled in 1931). 
He succeeded to the title of 2nd Baron Faringdon, and inherited the estate of Buscot Park from his grandfather Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon in 1934. In early life he had been prominent among the bright young things, but by the late 1930s had joined the Labour Party, and was a keen supporter of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, after serving in a field hospital in Aragon in 1936. In 1938 he gave a home to 40 child evacuees from Spain, as well as to several other notable exiles, at his Oxfordshire estate. 
A noted pacifist, Faringdon served in the London Fire Brigade during World War II. Post-war he was a prominent member of the Fabian Society, and also served on the London County Council. He was elected as a councillor on 16 April 1958 for the Woolwich West division but was defeated by a Conservative at the 1961 election. Following his defeat, he was appointed an alderman, a post he held until 1965. He then served on the Greater London Council's Historic Buildings Committee.
Gavin Henderson died in 1977 without issue, and was succeeded by his nephew Charles Michael Henderson as 3rd Baron Faringdon.

Microsoft litigation

Microsoft has been involved in numerous high-profile legal matters that involved litigation over the history of the company, including cases against the United States, the European Union, and competitors.
Governmental.
In its 2008 annual report, Microsoft stated:
Anti-trust.
In the 1990s, Microsoft adopted exclusionary licensing under which PC manufacturers were required to pay for an MS-DOS license even when the system shipped with an alternative operating system. Critics attest that it also used predatory tactics to price its competitors out of the market and that Microsoft erected technical barriers to make it appear that competing products did not work on its operating system. In a consent decree filed on July 15, 1994, Microsoft agreed to a deal under which, among other things, the company would not make the sale of its operating systems conditional on the purchase of any other Microsoft product. On February 14, 1995 Judge Stanley Sporkin issued a 45-page opinion that the consent decree was not in the public interest. Later that spring, a three-judge federal appeals panel removed Sporkin and reassigned the consent decree. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson entered the decree on August 21, 1995, three days before the launch of Windows 95.
A Microsoft purchase of Intuit was scuttled in 1994 due to antitrust concerns that Microsoft would be purchasing a major competitor.
After bundling the Internet Explorer web browser into its Windows operating system in the late 1990s (without requiring a separate purchase) and acquiring a dominant share in the web browser market, the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft was brought against the company. In a series of rulings by judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the company was found to have violated its earlier consent decree and abused its monopoly in the desktop operating systems market. The "findings of fact" during the antitrust case established that Microsoft has a monopoly in the PC desktop operating systems market:
Viewed together, three main facts indicate that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power. First, Microsoft's share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems is extremely large and stable. Second, Microsoft's dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry. Third, and largely as a result of that barrier, Microsoft's customers lack a commercially viable alternative to Windows. (III.34)
The findings of fact go on to explain the nature of the "barrier to entry":
The fact that there is a multitude of people using Windows makes the product more attractive to consumers. The large installed base... impels ISVs (independent software vendors) to write applications first and foremost to Windows, thereby ensuring a large body of applications from which consumers can choose. The large body of applications thus reinforces demand for Windows, augmenting Microsoft's dominant position and thereby perpetuating ISV incentives to write applications principally for Windows... The small or non-existent market share of an aspiring competitor makes it prohibitively expensive for the aspirant to develop its PC operating system into an acceptable substitute for Windows. (III.39–40)
The proposed remedy (dividing Microsoft into two companies) was overturned on appeal. While new penalties were under consideration, the Clinton administration ended and the Bush administration took office. The new administration announced that in the interest of ending the case as quickly as possible, it would no longer seek to break the company up, and that it would stop investigating claims of illegal tying of products. Eighteen days later, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered the justice department and Microsoft to "engage in discussions seven days a week, 24 hours a day." The judge cited the events of September 11, 2001 in her direction to begin settlement talks but did not explain the linkage between the two. Attorney General Ashcroft, however, denied that the events of September 11 had any effect on the outcome. Microsoft subsequently reached a settlement with the Department of Justice and some of the states which brought suit against it. Several class-action lawsuits filed after the conviction are still pending.
In early 2002, Microsoft proposed to settle the private lawsuits by donating $1 billion USD in money, software, services, and training, including Windows licenses and refurbished PCs, to about 12,500 underprivileged public schools. This was seen by the judge as a potential windfall for Microsoft, not only in educating schoolchildren on Microsoft solutions but also in flooding the market with Microsoft products. Among the protesters were Apple Inc. which feared further loss of its educational market share. The federal judge rejected the proposed settlement.
In 2003–2004, the European Commission investigated the bundling of Windows Media Player into Windows, a practice which rivals complained was destroying the market for their own products. Negotiations between Microsoft and the Commission broke down in March 2004, and the company was subsequently handed down a record fine of €497 million ($666 million) for its breaches of EU competition law. Separate investigations into alleged abuses of the server market were also ongoing at the same time. On December 22, 2004, the European Court decided that the measures imposed on Microsoft by the European Commission would not be delayed, as was requested by Microsoft while waiting for the appeal. Microsoft has since paid a €497 million fine, shipped versions of Windows without Windows Media Player, and licensed many of the protocols used in its products to developers in countries within the European Economic Area. However, the European Commission has charactized the much delayed protocol licensing as unreasonable, called Microsoft "non-compliant" and still violating antitrust law in 2007, and said that its RAND terms were above market prices; in addition, they said software patents covering the code "lack significant innovation", which Microsoft and the EC had agreed would determine licensing fees. Microsoft responded by saying, that other government agencies had found "considerable innovation". Microsoft appealed the facts and ruling to the European Court of First Instance with hearings in September 2006.
On September 17, 2007, the EU Court of First Instance rejected Microsoft's appeal.
The court affirmed the original contested finding:
All elements of Microsoft's appeal were dismissed.
Microsoft accepted the judgment of the Court of First Instance and proceeded to make available interoperability information as originally required by the European Commission.
Microsoft also faced competition law in South Korea and was fined $32 million in December 2005 and ordered to unbundle instant messaging, Windows Media Player and Windows Media Service, or let competitors' products take their place. Microsoft noted in their October 2005 SEC filing that they may have to pull out of South Korea, although they later denied fulfilling such a plan. Microsoft's 2006 appeal was struck down; they have another appeal pending.
European antitrust regulators on February 27, 2008 fined Microsoft $1.3 billion for failing to comply with a 2004 judgment, that the company had abused its market dominance. The new fine by the European Commission was the largest it has ever imposed on an individual company, and brings the total in fines imposed on Microsoft to about $US 2.5 billion, at current exchange rates.
Microsoft had previously been fined after the commission determined in 2004 that the company had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system to gain unfair market advantage. The commission imposing the new fine said, that it was because the company had not met the prescribed remedies after the earlier judgment.
European Union.
The European Union Microsoft competition case is a case brought by the European Commission of the European Union (EU) against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from Novell over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of Microsoft Windows without Windows Media Player.
February 2008 fine.
On February 27, 2008 the European Union (EU) competitions commission announced its decision to fine the Microsoft Corporation €899 million (US$1.35 billion), approximately 1/10 of the company's net yearly earnings, for failing to comply with the 2004 antitrust order.
The first decision in this antitrust case was given in 2004 citing that Microsoft withheld needed interoperability information from rival software companies which prevented them from making software compatible with Windows. The commission ordered Microsoft to provide this information. Microsoft agreed to this, providing the information for royalty fees of 6.85% of the licensee's revenues for the product on grounds of innovation (specifically, 3.87% for the patent license and of 2.98% for the information license). The EU found these royalty fees unreasonable and Microsoft was ordered to lower them. Microsoft complied with this, adjusting the royalty rates to 1.2% (changing the rates for the licenses to 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively) in the European Union, while keeping the rate the same for the rest of the world. The EU still saw this as an unreasonable rate, and Microsoft, two months after lowering the rates, reduced the rates yet again to a flat rate of €10000 or a royalty of 0.4% applicable worldwide. Microsoft's royalty rates, which were deemed unreasonable for the period of 15 months between June 21, 2006 and October 21, 2007 are the cause for the fine. So far, the EU has fined Microsoft €1.68 billion in 3 separate fines in this case. This fine will go towards the European Union annual budget.
The European Anti-trust commissioner Neelie Kroes stated that the fine was "reasonable and proportionate," as the figure could have gone up as high as €1.5 billion, the maximum that the EU commission can impose. She also said that it should act as "a signal to the outside world, and especially Microsoft, that they should stick to the rules" and that "Talk is cheap. Flouting the rules is expensive." Although she also expressed hope that "today's decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft's record of non-compliance with the Commission."
It is not certain whether Microsoft will appeal this decision. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that Microsoft will review this latest fine, citing that "The commission announced in October 2007 that Microsoft was in full compliance with the 2004 decision, so these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved." Microsoft's General Counsel Brad Smith commented "It's clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law. We will study this decision carefully, and if there are additional steps that we need to take in order to comply with it, we will take them." Microsoft had appealed against fines by the EU before, but all the charges were defeated. If Microsoft does not appeal the decision, the company will have 3 months (starting February 27) to pay the fine in full.
The decisions came after Microsoft announced they were disclosing 30,000 pages of previously secret software code last Thursday (February 21). The EU competition commissioner commented that this move "does not necessarily equal a change in business practice."
Spanish anti-trust investigation.
In September 2011, the competition commission in Spain began an investigation into Microsoft's licence agreements, which prevent the transfer of Microsoft software to third parties.
United States.
"United States v. Microsoft", 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000) was a set of consolidated civil actions filed against Microsoft Corporation on May 18, 1998 by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and twenty U.S. states. Joel I. Klein was the lead prosecutor. The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales. The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Microsoft Windows operating system. Bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft's victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of Internet Explorer. It was further alleged that this unfairly restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera) that were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store. Underlying these disputes were questions over whether Microsoft altered or manipulated its application programming interfaces (APIs) to favor Internet Explorer over third party web browsers, Microsoft's conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with OEM computer manufacturers, and Microsoft's intent in its course of conduct.
Microsoft stated that the merging of Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer was the result of innovation and competition, that the two were now the same product and were inextricably linked together and that consumers were now getting all the benefits of IE for free. Those who opposed Microsoft's position countered that the browser was still a distinct and separate product which did not need to be tied to the operating system, since a separate version of Internet Explorer was available for Mac OS. They also asserted that IE was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have kept the price of Windows higher than it might otherwise have been. The case was tried before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The DOJ was initially represented by David Boies. On June 30, 2004, the U.S. appeals court unanimously approved the settlement with the Justice Department, rejecting objections that the sanctions were inadequate.
Other.
In March 2004, during a consumer class-action lawsuit in Minnesota, internal documents subpoenaed from Microsoft revealed that the company had violated nondisclosure agreements seven years earlier in obtaining business plans from Go Corporation, using them to develop and announce a competing product named PenWindows, and convincing Intel to reduce its investment in Go. After Go was purchased by AT&T and Go's tablet-based computing efforts were shelved, PenWindows development was dropped.
In May 2004, a class-action lawsuit accused Microsoft of overcharging customers in the state of California. The company settled the case for $1.1 billion, and a California court ordered Microsoft to pay an additional $258 million in legal fees (including over $3,000 per hour for the lead attorney in the case, more than $2,000 per hour for colleagues, and in excess of $1,000 per hour for administrative work). A Microsoft attorney responded, "Somebody ends up paying for this. These large fee awards get passed on to consumers." The total bill for legal fees was later reduced to just over $112 million. Because of the structure of the settlement, the law firm which sued Microsoft could end up getting more money from the company than California consumers and schools, the beneficiaries of the settlement.
In 2006, Microsoft initiated an investigation of Lithuanian government institutions for determining whether they choose long-term strategies of the software they use correctly. The investigation, funded by Microsoft itself, will be performed by the Vilnius University together with the Lithuanian Institution of the Free Market, a think tank organization. The investigation was initialised after the government started to prepare 860 thousand litas project to encourage the use of open-source software. The vice-president of Microsoft, Vahe Torossian, stated that "the government should not be technologically subjectivist".
Microsoft was sued for the "Windows Vista Capable" logo
and in Iowa. Microsoft Word was also a subject of court case.
On July 12, 2013, Microsoft is suing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection over Google phone ban. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is also named in the lawsuit.
Private.
Microsoft has also fought numerous legal battles against private companies. The most prominent ones are against:
Patents.
Alcatel-Lucent.
The dispute between Microsoft and Lucent (and later Alcatel-Lucent) began in 2003 when Lucent Technologies (acquired by Alcatel in 2006) filed suit against Gateway in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Lucent also sued Dell in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; soon thereafter, that court transferred the Dell case to San Diego, where it was consolidated with the case against Gateway. Lucent claimed in this first San Diego case that Dell and Gateway had violated patents on MP3-related technologies developed by Bell Labs, a division of predecessor company American Telephone & Telegraph. Other patents said to be infringed relate to MPEG video technology, speech technology, internet technology, and other technologies. Microsoft intervened in the lawsuit in April 2003 and Alcatel was added after it acquired Lucent.
After the first San Diego lawsuit was filed, Microsoft and Lucent have filed additional patent lawsuits against each other. In February 2007, Microsoft filed a lawsuit at the International Trade Commission claiming that Alcatel-Lucent infringed its patents. There is a second case in San Diego where Microsoft is asserting that Alcatel-Lucent infringes 10 of its patents, and yet another case in Texas where each alleges that the other is infringing its patents.
SurfCast.
SurfCast is suing Microsoft for infringing patent on Live Tiles
Copyrights.
Apple.
"Apple Computer Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation", 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) was a copyright infringement lawsuit in which Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.) sought to prevent Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard from using visual graphical user interface (GUI) elements that were similar to those in Apple's Lisa and Macintosh operating systems. Some critics claimed that Apple was really attempting to gain all intellectual property rights over the desktop metaphor for computer interfaces, and perhaps all GUIs, on personal computers. Apple lost all claims in the lawsuit, except that the court ruled that the "trash can" icon and file folder icons from Hewlett-Packard's now-forgotten NewWave windows application were infringing. The lawsuit was filed in 1988 and lasted four years; the decision was affirmed on appeal in 1994, and Apple's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.
Trademarks.
Lindows.
"Microsoft v. Lindows.com, Inc." was a court case brought December 20, 2001 by Microsoft against Lindows, Inc, claiming that the name "Lindows" was a violation of its trademark "Windows." In addition to the United States, Microsoft has also sued Lindows in Sweden, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Canada. Michael Robertson has called this situation "Sextuple Jeopardy", an extension of the term double jeopardy.
In response to these lawsuits, Lindows had launched "ChoicePC.com", which allows people to purchase lifetime Lindows memberships that includes a free copy of LindowsOS, free LindowsOS upgrades for life, and a ChoicePC.com t-shirt, for $100 USD. All money from the memberships goes towards helping Lindows in its legal battle against Microsoft.
MikeRoweSoft.
In a legal dispute, Microsoft sued a Canadian high school student named Mike Rowe over the domain name MikeRoweSoft.com. The case received international press attention following Microsoft's perceived heavy handed approach to a 12th grade student's part-time web design business and the subsequent support that Rowe received from the online community. A settlement was eventually agreed, with Rowe granting ownership of the domain to Microsoft in return for training and gifts.
Shah.
Microsoft sued several parties for "contributory cybersquatting"—that is, encouraging others (through software and instructional videos) to cybersquat on domain names that infringed on Microsoft's trademarks. Microsoft prevailed in court and also established a precedent that liabilities under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) include contributory trademark infringement.
Windows Commander.
From 1993 until 2002, Total Commander was called Windows Commander; the name was changed in 2002 out of fear of a lawsuit after the developers received a letter from Microsoft pointing out that the word "windows" was trademarked by Microsoft.
wxWindows.
The wxWindows project was renamed to wxWidgets in September 2003 out of fear of a lawsuit after the founder developer Julian Smart received a letter from Microsoft pointing out that the 'Windows' is a UK trademark owned by Microsoft.
Microwindows.
The Microwindows project was renamed to Nano-X Window System in January 2005, due to legal threats from Microsoft regarding the Windows trademark.
Other.
Xbox 360.
Microsoft has been accused of deceiving consumers by concealing the high failure rate of its Xbox 360 game machine. A woman from California sued Microsoft on October 2008 in Superior Court in Sacramento County, stating that the company violated multiple state consumer-protection and unfair-competition laws. The woman alleged that the company continued to sell the Xbox 360 even though it knew that the console's hardware was likely to fail.
License refunds and EULA suits.
A Windows refund is a type of refund claimed by a user when they purchase a computer with the Microsoft Windows operating system pre-installed on it. The refund is issued by the hardware manufacturer, or occasionally the retailer, for the copy of Microsoft Windows, rather than the whole computer. Due to Microsoft's dominance in desktop computing and a lack of understanding on the manufacturer's or retailer's part, it is often difficult (but not impossible) for users to obtain a refund.
In 2006, a British man purchased a Dell Inspiron 640 m laptop bundled with Microsoft Windows XP Home SP2 preinstalled, but he did not accept Microsoft's End User License Agreement (EULA). In one week after his response, the customer received a "goodwill" refund of GBP £47 (£55.23 including tax) from Dell for a no Windows option, as the copy of the system was an "unused product" according to the software license agreement. Dell had not asked for the installation medium to be returned and commented that although it does not have a Windows refund program, giving a refund in an individual case is not forbidden either.
In a civil suit, Italian court rejected HP's argument that the licensing conditions had been set unilaterally by Microsoft and ruled HP to reimburse customer the amount of 90 euro for unused Windows XP bundled with Compaq notebook. The court was of the opinion that HP had to know about the conditions, because they most likely constituted part of the agreement between them and Microsoft. It also found the fact that computers without an operating system are available on the market to be irrelevant. According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, a German Dell customer replaced the preinstalled Windows with Linux and had been credited the amount of €78 for operating system and a further unspecified Microsoft program. A French court ruled Acer to refund the purchase price of preinstalled laptop software, of which was €135.20 for Windows XP Home. An Israeli Dell customer received $137 as a refund for Windows Vista.
Lenovo Czech Republic wanted its customer to sign a non-disclosure agreement before Windows licence refund to prevent him from talking about the deal, but the customer refused and took the story to local Linux web portal AbcLinuxu.cz, which gave him an equivalent amount of money for telling his story to the world.
$500 billion arbitration.
An Arkansas-native by the name of David Stebbins has recently filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, attempting to confirm an arbitration award in the amount of $500 billion. He claims that his basis for the suit is that he is holding corporations to the same contract modification practices that they often use on customers. According to Stebbins, corporations can, and often do, unilaterally amend the terms of their contracts, often in subtle and inconspicuous ways.
Stebbins decided to "give them a taste of their own medicine" and sent notice to Microsoft stating the terms of his Xbox Live gaming contract that "he'd" like to change, stating that Microsoft accepted the new terms upon not terminating Stebbins' account within ten days. These changes included an arbitration clause requiring Microsoft to respond to an invitation of legal arbitration within 24 hours, and also what Stebbins refers to as a "forfeit victory clause," stating that, if Microsoft does not respond to the arbitration within the 24-hour time frame, Stebbins automatically wins. He initiated an arbitration against Microsoft, claiming $500 billion in damages, but Microsoft did not respond, and Stebbins is now attempting to confirm the arbitration award.
Microsoft has declined to comment.

Cléo

Cléverson Gabriel Córdova (born 9 August 1985), commonly known as Cléo, is a Brazilian football striker who plays for Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande. He also holds Serbian citizenship.
While playing on three different continents, Cléo scored at least once in three of the most prestigious club continental competitions, in the Copa Libertadores for Atlético Paranaense, in the UEFA Champions League for Partizan, and in the AFC Champions League for two clubs, Guangzhou Evergrande and Kashiwa Reysol.
Club career.
Early years.
Born in Guarapuava, Cléo started playing football with Associação Atlética Batel. After some time of playing with Esporte Clube Comercial, Cléo was spotted by Olivais e Moscavide who brought him to Portugal in 2004. A little more than six months, Cléo returned to Brazil and signed for Atlético Paranaense, playing with them in the 2005 and 2006 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. Meanwhile, he had loan spells at Ferroviária, and Figueirense in 2005. In 2006, Cléo moved back to Olivais e Moscavide, staying there for next two seasons. In August 2008, Cléo joined Red Star Belgrade, on a one-year loan with a view to a permanent move.
Partizan.
2009–10 season.
On 19 June 2009, Cléo signed a four-year contract with Partizan and thus became the first player in more than 20 years to move from Red Star to Partizan (the last was Goran Milojević in 1988). Cléo scored on his debut for Partizan, on 14 July, against Welsh champions Rhyl for the overall victory of his team by 4–0. Seven days later, in the second leg, Cléo scored a hat-trick of which was particularly nice was the first goal achieved with an bicycle kick. On 28 November, Cléo scored a great goal against his former club to help Partizan 2–1 win over Red Star. Cléo played great in the second part of the 2009–10 Serbian SuperLiga, scoring nine goals, and thus helped Partizan to reach their third consecutive title.
2010–11 season.
Cléo opened the season by scoring the third goal in his team's 3–1 victory over Armenian champions Pyunik in the first leg of the second qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. One week later, second meeting in Yerevan, Cléo scored a fantastic goal from the edge of the penalty area in the fifth minute of injury time in the first half and also led his team to the next round with a total score of 4–1 on aggregate. In the first match of the third qualifying round, Cléo scored in the 90th minute for his team's 3–0 win against Finland's HJK. His fantastic form, Cléo completed by achieving both goals in the second leg. He also scored a goal in the first round of the 2010–11 Serbian SuperLiga against Inđija at home, thus continued his series of goals. On 18 August, in the play-off round first leg against Anderlecht, a game which ended 2–2, he scored his 7th goal in 6 matches. Six days later, on 24 August, Cléo scored twice against Anderlecht in the return tie, bringing his tally to 9 goals in 7 matches in the season. He was also accurate in the penalty shoot-out, and so helped Partizan to reach the Champions League for the first time in 7 years. On 4 September, a day when he filed a request for Serbian citizenship, Cléo scored his 10th goal in the season with an overhead bicycle kick in the match against Hajduk Kula. On 28 September, in the second round of the Champions League group stage, Cléo completed one of two penalties in a 3–1 defeat versus Arsenal. On 8 December 2010, again in a match against Arsenal, Cléo scored an equaliser at Emirates Stadium, however Partizan lost the game 3–1.
Guangzhou Evergrande.
2011 season.
On 12 February 2011, Cléo completed his move to Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande, signing a four-year deal. At the time, this move set a new record of Chinese football with €3.2 million ($4.5 million) transfer fee. He made his league debut for Guangzhou against Dalian Shide on 2 April and scored the winning goal in the match. Cléo started the season well by scoring 5 goals in his first 5 league appearances. However, Cléo suffered a muscular strain in leg during a FA Cup match against Guizhou Zhicheng on 4 May, ruling him out for two months. On 26 June, after recovering from injury, Cléo entered from the bench at the half and scored a penalty in the 60th minute against Jiangsu Sainty. He scored another four goals in the next four matches, but the recurrence of leg strain on 14 July against Nanchang Hengyuan ruling him out for a further two months. Cléo returned to training in late August but injured again in early September. The lingering injury kept him out of the field for the second half of the year. He managed to score 10 times in 10 appearances during the 2011 league season.
2012 season.
After the end of the 2011 season, it was reported that Guangzhou had decided to give up Cléo for his lingering injury. He was linked with France's Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille and another Super League club Guizhou Renhe. However, Cléo eventually stayed in Guangzhou for the 2012 season.
On 25 February 2012, Cléo scored both goals for Guangzhou in the 2012 Chinese FA Super Cup, a 2–1 victory over Tianjin Teda, which ensured Guangzhou win this trophy for the first time in the club's history. He continued his excellent form into the AFC Champions League, when he scored a brace in the first match of the group stage, as Guangzhou trashed K-League champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors 5–1 on 7 March. On 15 May, during Guangzhou's last group stage match of the AFC Champions League against Buriram United, Cléo earned a penalty in the 90th minute, which Darío Conca converted into the winning goal. Guangzhou beat Buriram United 2–1 and sealed a place in the knockout phase for the Chinese Super League side. On 30 May, Cléo scored the winning goal during the round of 16 in the AFC Champions League, as Guangzhou beat J-League side FC Tokyo 1–0 and became the first Chinese club to reach the quarter-finals of the competition since 2006. Although scored 4 goals in 7 matches, Cléo was replaced by newcomer Lucas Barrios in the 30-man squad which was submitted for the next stage of the Champions League. On 18 August, in the interview after a league match against Changchun Yatai, which Cléo made a goal and an assist to help Guangzhou win the match 2–1, he said that he felt sad with club's decision to exclude him from the Champions League squad and would seek a transfer at the end of the season. Cléo played as regular starter in the domestic league and helped Guangzhou Evergrande win their second Super League championship and first FA Cup title.
Kashiwa Reysol.
On 25 January 2013, Cléo moved to J. League Division 1 side Kashiwa Reysol on a one-year loan deal.
International career.
Cléo never played any international game for his home country Brazil, and in August 2010, he said that he would like to play for the Serbian national team and is yet up to Serbian coach to give him a call. On 4 September, Cléo applied for Serbian citizenship after meeting with Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Ivica Dačić. On 23 September, Cléo became a citizen of Serbia. However, according to FIFA rules for expatriate players, Cléo is ineligible to play for Serbia.

Snap, Wiltshire

Snap is an abandoned village near Aldbourne in Wiltshire, England. It is unusual in that it was not abandoned until the 20th century.
The village was recorded in 1268 under the name of Snape. It was always a small place: in the 14th century there were 19 poll-tax payers, in 1773 there were between 5 and 10 cottages and in the 1851 Census the population was 41. In 1905, Henry Wilson, a butcher from Ramsbury, bought the two farms in the village and converted them from arable to sheep farming, which deprived the villagers of their work. By 1909 there were only 2 residents, and by 1914 the village was deserted.
Most of the buildings were destroyed when the site was used for military training in the First World War, and were later plundered for building materials. Only earthworks are now visible. The name is remembered in Snap Farm.
The site lies near the Ridgeway National Trail.

Cantata (Stravinsky)

The Cantata by Igor Stravinsky is a work for soprano, tenor, female choir, and instrumental ensemble (of two flutes, oboe, cor anglais (doubling second oboe), and cello), and was composed from April 1951 to August 1952. The premiere performance on 11 November 1952 was by the Los Angeles (Chamber) Symphony Society (to whom the work is dedicated), conducted by Stravinsky himself. After completing the opera "The Rake's Progress", Stravinsky felt the urge to compose another work setting English words, but in a non-dramatic form (White 1979, 468–69).
The piece consists of the following movements:
The dirge sections concern a soul's approach to and journey through purgatory. "Ricercar II" sets the carol "Tomorrow shall be my dancing day". "Westron Wind" is a sixteenth-century song.

Addicted (Saving Abel song)

"Addicted" is the debut single of rock band Saving Abel from their 2008 self-titled album "Saving Abel".
The song is about a man who is "addicted" to a girl, either emotionally, or for the sex they have. The original lyrics of the song are ""I'm so addicted to all the things you do / When you're going down on me in between the sheets"," whereas the radio edit lyrics are ""I'm so addicted to all the things you do / When you're rollin' 'round with me in between the sheets"." Some radio versions of the song either have the lyric ""It's not like you to turn away / From all the bullshit I can take"" censored or amended to ""It's not like you to turn away / From all the positions that we take.""
In November 2008, "Addicted" was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was also placed at #97 on "Billboards Top Hot 100 Hits of 2008. It had at that point sold almost 800,000 copies and was well on its way to going platinum. Co-writer Skidd Mills won a BMI Pop Award for “most played song” for Saving Abel’s "Addicted."
On the 12th of January 2009, "Addicted" debuted at number 93 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and later entered the top 50 at number 48. In the United States, it has reached number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first top-twenty hit. It was their only entry on either chart.
Addicted was also featured in the 104.5 CHUM FM CD, "Today's Best Music 2009".
Music videos.
There are two official music videos for this song.
The first video released, directed by Anthony Honn, is a video shoot for many models, including some of them topless and in other suggestive positions. There is also a clean (edited) version of the video.
The second video, directed by Steven Oritt, features the band playing the song along with a man in his house watching a woman through binoculars in her house as she swims, takes a bath and dresses for a night out. While she is getting dressed, the man watching her sees a figure in dark clothes sneak up to her door, and creep in without knocking. The man panics, puts down the binoculars and picks up his keys. He drives to her house, and knocks on the door. He is surprised to see the hooded man on the other side of the door, with the girl he'd been watching right behind him. Embarrassed, he says nothing while the couple leaves holding hands.

Maljčiki

"Maljčiki" (Serbian: Маљчики, Russian for "Boys") is the second single by the Serbian and former Yugoslav New Wave music band Idoli. It also appeared on the Yugoslav New Wave compilation "Paket aranžman" which is one of the most important Yugoslav rock releases.
History.
Vlada Divljan, the member of Idoli wanted to create a song which would be a parody on the Soviet Socialist realism. The song depicts a sort of Stakhanov-like proletarian who enthusiastically wakes up in the early dawn to go to work in a mine and a metallurgy factory.
The official release of the song featured the following lyrics: "Plamene zore bude me iz sna; Fabrička jutra, dim iz dimnjaka" ("Dawns on fire, wake me from my dream; Factory mornings, smoke from the chimney").
However, the original unreleased version of the lyrics was: "Kakane zore, bude me iz sna; Kakana jutra, kakan sam i ja" ("Shitty dawns, wake me from my dream; Shitty mornings, I am also shitty"). But when the band entered the studio with the producer Goran Bregović, the record label Jugoton did not want to release the song with these lyrics, so they were changed. 
The song also included ethnic Russian music elements and some nebulose Russian language lyrics that nobody from the band could understand. The Russian language part on the officially released version was narrated by Dragan Papić who was the band's manager at that time.
A re-recorded version of "Maljčiki" was included on Paket aranžman compilation. By that time the band was playing on a more expensive equipment which can be heard on this version. The record was produced by Enco Lesić.
A live version of "Maljčiki" was included on Vlada Divljan's live album "Odbrana i Zaštita".
Promotional video.
Promotional video for "Maljčiki" followed the release of the Paket aranžman compilation. The video featured a parody of soc-realist iconography, for example actors posing as miners and metallurgy workers, while the band members, dressed formally in suits and ties posed as apparatchiks. It was broadcast for a first time at the New Years Eve on the then-popular "Rokenroler" show on the national television. 
SFR Yugoslavia was not a member of the Eastern Bloc but a Non-aligned country, so the band did not have any specific problems with the authorities concerning the release of the song and video. However, the Soviet embassy sent a protest note to the TV and radio stations which broadcast the song and some of them banned it.
Even though the band was playing on a good professional equipment, in the video they intentionally used old Slovene and Czech instruments to adjust with the whole concept of the song. The Russian narration part was done on lip sync by Šaper even though the original was recorded by Papić.
Legacy.
In 2006 the song was ranked #18 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list.
Yugoton version.
"Malcziki" (original "Maljčiki") is a Polish version of the famous Idoli song and was released as a single from the Yugoslav rock tribute album Yugoton. The version contains lyrics in Polish and a Russian narrative part from the original lyric. The track was performed by Kazik and Vlada Divljan, who participated the recording, sang backing vocals and did the narration part of the song. It was also featured on several Polish rock compilations. The single also featured two more versions, one entirely sang by Divljan. 
A promotional video was also recorded for the track.

Pockmark (geology)

Pockmarks are craters in the seabed caused by fluids (gas and liquids) erupting and streaming through the sediments. 
Pockmarks were discovered off the coasts of Nova Scotia, Canada in the late 1960s by Lew King and Brian McLean of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography. As pockmarks are uncommon on the land surface, they were not expected in the ocean. 
They were discovered off Nova Scotia, using a new side scan sonar developed in the late 1960s by Kelvin Hughes.
The craters off Nova Scotia are up to 150 m in diameter and 10 m deep. Pockmarks have been found worldwide. Discovery was aided by the use of high-resolution multibeam acoustic systems for bathymetric mapping. In these cases, pockmarks have been interpreted as the morphological expression of gas or oil leakage from active hydrocarbon system or a deep overpressured petroleum reservoir.

Hypnale walli

Hypnale walli is a venomous pitviper species endemic to Sri Lanka. The smallest member of its genus, it is distinguished by having a strongly upturned nose and lower scale counts. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Etymology.
The specific name, "walli", is in honor of Ceylonese-born British herpetologist Frank Wall.
Description.
The smallest member of the genus "Hypnale", the only male with a complete tail measured 30.5 cm (12 inches) in total length with a tail of 4.3 cm (1⅝ in) (14% of total length), while the largest female was 28.3 cm (11⅛ inch) in total length with a tail of 3.5 cm (1⅜ in) (12% of total length). The body is stoutly built.
This species is distinguished from "H. hypnale" by a snout that has a strongly upturned tip. This is due to an extended rostral scale, which is immediately followed by a raised wart-like hump covered with 10 minute scales. Also, the hemipenes have clearly visible spines. It is distinguished from "H. nepa" by its lower scale counts.
The scalation includes 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody that usually lack keels, 7 supralabial scales, 120-126 ventral scales, and 28-33 subcaudal scales.
Regarding the color pattern, Gloyd and Conant (1990) examined a number of preserved specimens, mentioning that some were so faded as to render the pattern almost invisible. One of these, however, had a faint narrow stripe down the center of its back. In general, the color pattern is described as consisting of a series of 18-24 dorsolateral small subtriangular brown blotches, pointing upwards. These are slightly darker than the ground color, except for the upper edges that may be considerably darker. A pair of dark brown blotches are present on the side of the head, along with a pair of dark stripes curving backward on the sides of the neck. The ventral surface is strongly flecked and dappled with grayish brown.
Geographic range.
"Hypnale walli" is found in Sri Lanka. The type locality given is "Kanneliya Forest, Udugama Southern Province, Ceylon Lanka, elevation approximately 1,000 ft. m".
Taxonomy.
According to Gloyd and Conant (1990), the taxonomic status of this species is unclear. Although described here as a species, it may eventually be classified as a subspecies of "H. nepa", or even as the minimum extreme for "H. nepa" with regard to its low ventral and subcaudal scale counts, as well as its relatively short tail.

Tsenovo (, pronounced ; also transliterated "Cenovo" or "Tzenovo") is a village in northeastern Bulgaria, part of Ruse Province. It is the administrative centre of Tsenovo Municipality, which lies in the western part of Ruse Province. It is located along the lower course of the Yantra River, in the central Danubian Plain, 32 kilometres from Svishtov and 45 kilometres from the provincial capital of Rousse.
The modern village was founded in the late 16th-early 17th century as the farm of the Gülhane Park administrator at the imperial palace of Topkapı in Istanbul, named Kara Ali. The settlement gradually grew, as many people settled around the inn; the village was first named "Çauşhan" and "Çauşköy". Following the Liberation of Bulgaria, the name was Bulgarianized by the addition of the -evo suffix, turning it into "Chaushevo". On 14 August 1934, it was renamed to "Tsenovo" in honour of the influential Svishtov merchant Dimitar Apostolov Tsenov who donated 40 million leva for the construction of the Svishtov University of Economics.

List of Ambassadors of Russia to Austria

The first Ambassador of Russia to Austria was Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn and he served in this position from 1763 until 1792. Gallitzinstraße, the street where his ambassadorial villa was located is named after him. In 1792 Count Andrey Kirillovich Razumovsky became ambassador in Vienna, where he kept contact with representatives of the European aristocracy, politicians and artists. While in Vienna, he built the Palais Rasumofsky, and also financed construction of a stone bridge across the Danube. As a patron of the arts, Razumovsky established an art gallery, and commissioned Beethoven to compose the famous Razumovsky string quartets.
Austria is closely linked to the fate of prominent Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov. He arrived in Vienna in 1833 as an adviser to the embassy, and, from 1854 to 1856, he led the Russian diplomatic mission. Gorchakov became Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian court at the most difficult period for Russia during the Crimean War, during which time he was able to preserve diplomatic relations with Austria and helped to overcome the international isolation of the Russian Empire and reinforced Russia's status as a great power. The Vienna Conference in 1855 was the first presence of Gorchakov in an international forum, and his performance in representing Russia at the Paris Conference of 1856 saw Alexander II appoint him as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
In 1882, scientist and diplomat Prince Aleksey Borisovich Lobanov-Rostovsky was appointed as the Empire's representative in Vienna. In 1891 he bought several houses on Reisnerstraße from Adolphe I, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, the former Duke of Nassau, which still houses the embassy and consular section in Vienna, and he also began construction of the Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral.
After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic relations at the level of political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.

Flag and coat of arms of Kelantan

The flag and the coat of arms of Kelantan are state symbols of Kelantan, Malaysia. Like the flag of Kedah, the Kelantanese flag is red with a single charge from Kelantan's coat of arms,
albeit partially.
Similar to other states of Malaysia with Malay royalties, both the flag and arms of Kelantan are influenced by Kelantanese royalties, Islam, and political and natural symbols of the state.
Flag.
Adopted in 1924, the Kelantanese flag consists of only a red field with a white charge in the centre derived from its state coat of arms, consisting of the arm's crescent, five pointed star, dual spears and unsheathed "kris"es. The red represents the honesty of Kelantan's settlers, citizens and king (the Sultan of Kelantan), while the charge signifies the sanctity of the Sultan of Kelantan.
History.
Between 1912 and 1923, Kelantan adopted a significantly different flag design, which encompasses a white flag with a blue border enveloping the top, fly, and hoist of the flag, and Jawi scriptures stylised as a feline. The tip of the tail is interpreted as ""Kerajaan Kelantan"" (denoting the Kelantanese government), while the main body of the animal-based scripture contains two passages from the Qur'an, an excerpt of the 13th "ayat" of the 61st "surah", the "Al-Saf":
Following the abolishment of the 1912-1923 flag and the adoption of the new red-and-white flag in 1924, the charge of the new flag was given minor refinements over time. Between 1928 and 1932, accounts of the flag were made indicating the charge's heraldic elements was more closely similar to that of the arms. While white, the charge sported more intricate details in the interior, and the points of the star are connected to their opposite corners by red lines. These details are since removed, contributing to a more silhouetted appearance of the charge.
Variants.
Royal Standards.
The royal family of Kelantan flies a series of flags for its respectable members. High-ranking members are designated their own flags, while others are grouped to fly any one of three flags. The flags vary by design, but are typically designed as either a plain flag or a flag with a quarter-length hoist.
Coat of arms.
Design.
The Kelantanese coat of arms, bearing elements of Western heraldry, consists of a crescent and a five-pointed star backed by three sets of weapons (compared to only two on the state's flag). The arms is further supported by a pair of salient muntjacs ("kijang"s), topped by a coronet, and includes a motto as a scroll below. Also present are decorative flora. The arms may be depicted entirely in yellow-to-orange, but variants with more vibrant inclusions of red and blue are also in use.
The Kelantese arms was introduced in 1916 under the order of Sultan Mohamed IV. Originally consisting of only the crescent and star, the three pair of weapons and the motto, the "kijang"s and coronet were only added several years later by Sultan Ismail (1880 - 1944), resulting in its present form. Until 1916, Kelantan had no coat of arms.

Capen Street (MBTA station)

Capen Street (signed as Capen St) is a station on MBTA's Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line, a branch of the Red Line. The station is located on Capen Street off Eliot Street in Milton, Massachusetts. The station opened on August 26, 1929, as did the rest of the line. On June 24, 2006, it closed for a yearlong renovation of the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line. Capen Street reopened on December 22, 2007, along with the rest of the line.
Services.
Capen Street serves the town of Milton, Massachusetts, and is the westernmost MBTA station within the town. The station is at grade level and is adjacent to the Capen Street grade crossing. From Capen Street, passengers can travel outbound to the Mattapan neighborhood of Boston or inbound to Ashmont where they can transfer to the heavy-rail portion of the Red Line and travel to other areas of Boston.
Capen Street consists of two side platforms which serve the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line's two tracks. The platforms are staggered to allow trains to make the stop at Capen Street before crossing the street itself, as there is no signal at the grade crossing. Capen Street is wheelchair accessible via wooden ramps on both platforms. A small shelter is located on the inbound platform. Capen Street has no fare controls, and fares from the station are paid on the train. 
Signage.
Capen Street had red signage up until the Ashmont–Mattapan Line's closure for renovation in 2006. When the station reopened in 2007, green signage had been installed at the station as well as the other stations on the line, contrary to the MBTA's practice of color-coding signage to match the line. However, in 2008 the green signage was replaced with red signage to match the line's color.

Hellnahellir

Hellnahellir is the largest man-made or artificial cave in Iceland. It is located in Landsveit, South Iceland. The cave is almost 50m long and the walls are covered with engravings. Its age is unknown but it is most probably from 12th or 13th century.
Tenglar.
Hellar in Landsveit 
Hellar in Landsveit is a farm in the southern part of Iceland, approximately one and a half hours drive from Reykjavík. To those of us, who in one way or another root from there, this place is one of great beauty, intriguing family history, happy memories and the marvellous adventures of childhood. To others Hellar is mostly known as the place where you find Hellnahellir, Iceland’s biggest manmade cave.
Hellnahellir is Iceland’s biggest man made cave, approximately 50 meters long. It has two exits, one at each end, and five chimneys built up from the ceiling whose purpose is likely to have been to provide daylight and perhaps to allow smoke from fireplaces to escape from the cave. The cave is built into the mountain Skarðsfjall and lies far enough beneath the surface for it to be free of frost in the winter. In fact the temperature in the cave is about the same the whole year round. 
The name Hellnahellir roughly translates into “The Cave at Caves” - hellir meaning cave and Hellar being both the name of the farm where Hellnahellir is at and also plural for the word cave. 
It will probably never be known for certain how old Hellnahellir really is. Some believe that the cave, or at least some parts of it, was dug out and lived in by Papar, Irish monks who dwelled in Iceland shortly before the Vikings settled in, around the year 900. If this is really the case it makes the cave just about one thousand years old. Cross marks on the walls and a somewhat large niche, dug into the wall in one place andbelieved to be the something of an altar, are among the things that support this theory. 
If the Irish monks were not be responsible for building Hellnahellir it must instead be built by the farmers living in the area sometime between the years 900 and 1332 because in documents from the latter year the name of the farm, Hellar (Caves), turns up. Since the name of the farm so obviously derives from the existence of caves on the premises it shows that there must have been at least more than one cave there at the time, and what is more, impressive enough to give the farm it’s name. These facts therefore make Hellnahellir at least 700 years old. 
Hellnahellir’s original purpose is a bit dependent on the time when it was built but the later it happened we can suppose it becomes less likely to have been inhabited by people. On the other hand we can ask ourselves why it has all those chimneys in the ceiling if its sole purpose was to house farm animals, hay or food which wouldn’t have needed that much daylight and certainly no smoke-spewing fireplaces. 
No archaeological remains have been found in the cave which can support theories about its origin in one way or another. It is however quite clear that Hellnahellir is made by man, dug out of sandstone with the primitive tools of the time when it was made. 
The front half of Hellnahellir, the area closest to the barn was used for a long to store hay in the winter. The other half was at the same time full of loose sand, so much of it that there was only about enough space for a person to crawl between the sand and the ceiling – if in fact anyone had the unlikely urge or the nerve to be crawling about in such a confined and dark place anyway. The sand was finally removed from this end of the cave in the years around 1950, leaving the cave in about the same state it is now. 
It is not clear when all this sand entered the cave but landslides coming from the mountain above are however the reason it came to be there. Since big earthquakes have frequently shook this area through the years, it both being in the neighbourhood of the famous volcano Hekla and in also in a part of Iceland which is subject to large earthquakes several times each century, there are ample opportunities for this to have happened. 
Since the grassy green mountainside above the cave doesn’t bare any signs of landslides nowadays it seems clear that the sand must have entered the cave some centuries ago. In Icelandic historical references regarding farmland in Iceland, written in 1702-1714, it says that landslides spoil fields at the Hellar farm which perhaps refers to the ones that fell into the cave. The descriptions are not accurate enough though for anything but speculations and it could just as well refer to other landslides, elsewhere in the mountain. 
Although those landslides must have been a great curse to whoever lived at this farm at the time, they may have been something of a blessing in disguise for Hellnahellir. This is because the landslides have put a several meters thick layer of earth on top of the cave essentially putting it further into the ground than it originally was. The layer of earth contributes to a better preservation of the cave in the form of a sort of insulation that makes the temperature inside it more even and the cave less likely to be subject to frost and water damages.
Cow-farming was discontinued at Hellar farm in 1982 and since then Hellnahellir has not been used to store hay in it. Its occupation nowadays is mostly to be viewed by those travellers interested in taking a look at it and to house a few gatherings that have been held there in recent years. The acoustics in Hellnahellir are quite good so concerts have been held there on several occasions and in the year 2000 the bishop of Iceland even held mass in the cave. 
Those happenings have made this cave known to some people as The Singing-Cave rather than by its actual name Hellnahellir. 
With Hellnahellir comes the old legend that once upon a time a small calf stumbled into the cave and got lost. To look for the poor little calf a workman was sent in after it who wandered around down there in the darkness for some time without any success in finding the calf. When the workman however heard the humming of a river on top of his head he got scared and turned back. Finally when he returned to the surface, quite embarrassed with no calf to show for his efforts, there was golden sand in his shoes which he had unwittingly picked up along the way. 
What happened to the calf then? It turned up several days later when the farmer at Stóri-Núpur, a farm at a several kilometres distance away from Hellar and on the other side of Þjórsá-river, heard mooing coming out from under his bed. Upon a closer look it turned out to be the calf that got lost in the cave, safe and sound except for its tail which it had somehow lost along the way.

Flabellaria is a genus in the Malpighiaceae, a family of about 75 genera of flowering plants in the order Malpighiales. "Flabellaria" includes one variable species, "F. paniculata", which is widely distributed in equatorial Africa in thickets, woodlands, and forests, especially along rivers.
External links.
Phytochemical and antibacterial studies of the leaf extracts of Flabelleria paniculata cav, have been investigated . Antibacterial activity was investigated using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Methanol extract of F. paniculata was fractionated into petroleum ether, chloroform and aqueous layers successively. Pet. Ether and aqueous fractions were found inactive. At 10mg/ml chloroform extract produced zone of inhibition of 3mm (S. aureus), 2mm (Ps. aeruginosa), 2mm (E. coli) and 3mm (K. pneumoniae). Chloroform extract showed MIC values of 1 .75 mg/ml and 2mg/ml for Ps. aeruginosa and S. aureus respectively. Saponins, cardenolides, alkaloid and tannins were detected in the leaf. 
In a follow up study to an initial antibacterial study on the methanol leaf extract, Olugbuyiro et al. have reported [2,3] the anti-infective and wound healing effect of the chloroform and aqueous fractions of F. paniculata on wounds inoculated with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. 
The findings revealed that chloroform fraction exhibited significant wound healing potency (p < 0.05) as compared with controls. The test drug achieved 100% wound contraction on day 14 in non-infected group, on day 16 in Staphylococcus aureus infected group and on day 18 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa group. Chloroform extract of Flabellaria paniculata has proved to be a potential anti-infective and wound healing agent. Its in vitro antibacterial and in vivo wound healing activities are in good agreement with the local medicinal use of the plant for skin diseases and sores.

Harry Otto Fischer

"Harry Fischer redirects here. For those of a similar name, see Henry Fischer (disambiguation), Harry Fisher (disambiguation) and Harold Fischer"
Harry Otto Fischer (1910–1986) was an American science fiction fan best known for helping his college friend Fritz Leiber create the sword and sorcery heroes Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser and their imaginary world of Nehwon.
The fictional heroes were loosely based on their creators, the barbarian Fafhrd on Leiber, and the thief The Gray Mouser on Fischer. In 1937, Fischer and Leiber designed a board game set in this fantasy world and each began composing a story with the same setting, Fischer's being "The Lords of Quarmall" and Leiber's "The Adventure of the Grain Ships." Neither story was finished until much later; Fischer's work on "The Lords of Quarmall" amounted to the first 10,000 words of the story.
1939 saw the first professional publication of a story featuring the heroes and their setting, "Two Sought Adventure", in "Unknown" magazine. This and most subsequent stories featuring the pair were written by Leiber, and all but one were set in the fantasy world Leiber and Fischer created.
The original tales begun by Fischer and Leiber on the pair were completed by Leiber and published in the 1960s. "The Adventure of the Grain Ships" was finally published in the magazine "Fantastic" as "Scylla's Daughter" in 1961, and was later expanded into the novel "The Swords of Lankhmar" (1968); "The Lords of Quarmall" was finally published, also in "Fantastic", in 1964. He also wrote "The Childhood and Youth of the Gray Mouser," published in 1978 in The Dragon #18.
Fischer and Leiber contributed to the original game design of the wargame "Lankhmar" - published in 1976 by TSR.

Larry Murray is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. He played all or part of six seasons in the majors, two for the New York Yankees and one for the Oakland Athletics.
Yankees.
Murray was drafted by the Yankees out of high school in the 3rd round of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his major league debut in , and played a handful of games in the majors in the next two seasons as well. His greatest asset was his speed, as evidenced by his use mostly as a pinch runner, though he did also play some outfield.
A's.
Murray's big break came during the early part of the season. With Charlie Finley's dismantling of the team in full swing, the A's shipped Mike Torrez to the Yankees in exchange for Dock Ellis, Marty Perez, and Murray. While Ellis was fairly quickly shipped off himself to the Texas Rangers, Murray was given a chance to establish himself with Oakland. In 90 games, however, Murray batted just .179, with just 9 RBI in 179 at bats. He did steal 12 bases.
After spending most of back in the minor leagues, Murray got another chance in , but fared little better, batting a paltry .186. Even his speed seemed to desert him, as he stole just 6 bases in 12 tries, and he was soon benched in favor of Tony Armas. That would be the end of Murray's major league career.
Murray played one more season of professional baseball with the Ogden A's in , then retired.

Leopold Gottlieb

Leopold Gottlieb (born in 1883 in Drohobycz then in the Austrian sector of the Partitioned Poland, now Lviv region, Ukraine – died in Paris in 1934) was a Polish-Jewish modernist painter. His brother Maurycy Gottlieb who was also a painter, died before Leopold was born.
Career.
Leopold Gottlieb began his formal art education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków under the direction of Jacek Malczewski. After graduating the academy, he moved to Munich to continue his studies in the studio of Anton Azbego.
In 1904, at the age of 21 he settled in Paris and became a member of the Circle of Montparnasse artists. During the years 1904-1907, he exhibited his works in group exhibitions with four other fellow artists in Kraków, Lvov, Vienna, Berlin, and Warszawa. In 1910, he moved to Jerusalem to teach in the Bezalel School of Art. Following his return to Paris In the years 1917-1919, he took part in exhibition of Polish Expressionists (Formists) and became friends with another Polish artist, Moses Kisling, Eugene Zak and Mela Muter. His artistic talent was acknowledged by the esteemed critics of that time, André Salmon and Adolf Basler, and his works were displayed in the Salon of Autumn, Independents, Société Nationale des Beaux Artes, and the Tuileries. He participated in exhibitions in the Vienna Secession. He also participated in the exhibition of Polish art, organized in 1912, Jose Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona.
First World War.
During the First World War he joined the Polish Legions. During his service in the Legions, he used to draw and document scenes depicting everyday life in the formation and the life of his fellow soldier commanders. His drawings and lithographs were presented in the "Exhibition of Polish Legions," which took place in Lublin in 1917. After the war, he settled in Poland, in Vienna, and then in Germany. 
In 1926, he returned to Paris where he exhibited at the Galerie aux Quatre Chemins (1927), d'Art de Montparnasse (1928), Bonaparte (1930), and Zak (1934). In 1929 and 1930, he joined the exhibition of the Association of Polish Artists.
Artistic style.
Gottlieb's paintings often depict biblical themes with range of brown, green, and pink pearl tones that intensify with linear rhythm. This rhythm makes the images gain characteristics of ritual ceremony or music. The content of his painting display a rich language of icons and symbols which are drawn from Christian iconography. Gottlieb also painted many portraits of famous people, including Diego Rivera, and Helena Rubinstein.

The Wireless Network Adapter for the Xbox 360 is a device that is plugged into the system's rear USB port, allowing for access to the internet via a wireless router.
Wii.
While the Wii has built-in wireless capabilities, it is not compatible with every wireless router. For this reason Nintendo released the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector peripheral that a Wii can connect wirelessly to via an internet enabled computer, wireless or otherwise.
Handhelds.
Game Boy Color.
The Mobile GB Adaptor was a Japan-only device that attached to the EXT port on a Game Boy Color. The other end was connected to a cell phone, allowing for access to the internet. It was primarily used for trading and battling on Pokémon Crystal.
Game Boy Advance.
The Game Boy Advance and its two redesigns, the Game Boy Advance SP and the Game Boy Micro all had wireless adapters that were meant to replace the link cable used for local multiplayer. It is not compatible with any game released prior to the adapter's release, and afterwards was only compatible with a select few games.
Nintendo DS.
Much like the Wii, the Nintendo DS has built-in wireless capabilities and is similarly not compatible with all wireless routers. Another hindrance is that the DS does not support certain levels of wi-fi encryption (e.g. WPA), thus necessitating the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector.

Room divider

A room divider is a screen or piece of furniture placed in a way that divides a room into separate areas.
Room dividers are used by interior designers and architects as means to divide space into separate distinct areas.
There are a number of different types of room dividers such as cubicle partitions, pipe and drape screens, shoji screens, and walls. Room dividers can be made from many materials, including wood, fabric, plexiglass, framed cotton canvas, pleated fabric or mirrors. Plants, shelves or railings might also be used as dividers. Portable room dividers have folded wall panels supported on wheels.
Types.
In general, room dividers are used in one of these ways:
Room dividers differ in nature being either:
They may completely obscure as in floor to ceiling dividers, or may allow sight through as for example when plant pots are used to divide areas
Uses.
Houses, and other residences, use a room divider to divide the space more effectively or as a decorating focus point. There are many uses for a room divider including: dividing the room, adding privacy to any space, hiding clutter and increasing storage and accents to the room. Other uses include adding color, redirecting foot traffic, creating a foyer, adding a desk front modesty screen, creating coziness, or adding a decorative background.
Most commonly used in the residence is a small room divider, sometimes called a folding shoji screen. Shoji screens are usually tri-fold walls. A shoji screen may also be used to section off part of a bedroom or family room as an office. Plants, bookshelves, railings, fireplaces, light fixtures, and drapes have all been used to effectively create distinct spaces in individuals apartments and homes.
In schools or religious facilities, room dividers primarily are used to create temporary classrooms for education in large open rooms. Since the rooms were designed originally to be open for other purposes, the most common type of room divider is a portable room divider on casters which can easily be moved from place to place. After class, the room divider is rolled back into its storage area for future use.
Hotels and restaurants use two different types of room dividers. Commonly, you will see floor-to-ceiling room dividers in banquet halls and meeting spaces. These fixed dividers can be used to divide a banquet room into smaller facilities. In areas where room dividers need more flexibility, hotels and restaurants might use portable partitions similar to those used in schools.
In offices, room dividers are typically more permanent in nature and attached directly to the floor. These office cubicles room dividers allow taking a large office space and breaking it into quieter and more focused subdivided offices.
Convention centers, by their very nature, are large facilities with wide open internal spaces. Consequently, they often need to be broken down into smaller areas. The most common room divider used in convention center is pipe and drape. The convention center sets up frames made of plastic, metal, or wire tubing. Fabric material is then hung over the frame to create back drops and hide other unsightly places in addition to creating multiple subdivided rooms.
History.
The folding room screens were found in China in the 7th century where they were mainly used by royalty. They were very heavy and ornate, and were not moved around. In the 8th century, the Japanese began using lighter, more portable room dividers for tea ceremonies, religious events and outdoor processions. European travelers developed their own version of Asian screen dividers using wood, leather, silk, mirrors and decoupage. Folding room dividers are now used in dwellings, hospitals, schools, restaurants, corporate offices and convention centers.

Colegrove v. Green

Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549 (1946), was a United States Supreme Court case. Writing for a 4-3 plurality, Justice Felix Frankfurter held that the federal judiciary had no power to interfere with issues regarding apportionment of state legislatures. The Court held that Article I, section IV of the U.S. Constitution left to the legislature of each state the authority to establish the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives, and that only Congress (and thus not the federal judiciary) could determine whether individual state legislatures had fulfilled their responsibility to secure fair representation for citizens.
The "Colegrove" decision would later be relegated to near irrelevancy by "Baker v. Carr".
Ruling.
"Colegrove" arose from the failure of Illinois to redistrict its Congressional delegation since 1901, despite internal migration that had left wide population disparities between various districts. Three voters sued, asserting what would now be known as malapportionment: a rural county of 1,000 and an urban county of 100,000 would have an equal vote. 
The court characterized the case as "an appeal to the federal courts to reconstruct the electoral process of Illinois in order that it may be adequately represented in the councils of the Nation. Because the Illinois legislature has failed to revise its Congressional Representative districts in order to reflect great changes, during more than a generation, in the distribution of its population, we are asked to do this, as it were, for Illinois." The court decided that this was a nonjusticiable question: "The remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the ample powers of Congress."
Dissent by Justice Black.
Dissenting, Justice Hugo Black argued that the Constitution required each citizen's vote carry equal weight. "While the Constitution contains no express provision requiring that congressional election districts established by the States must contain approximately equal populations," Black wrote, "the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote, and the right to have one's vote counted clearly imply the policy that state election systems, no matter what their form, should be designed to give approximately equal weight to each vote cast." Black thought it wrong that a citizen living in a district of 900,000 people had as much or less political power than someone living in a district with 112,000.
Lack of a full court.
The "Colegrove" case was voted on by only seven justices because Chief Justice Stone had just died, and Justice Robert Jackson had taken a leave to serve as chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg Trials.
Aftermath.
Critics of "Colegrove" complained that it deprived state citizens of federal remedies, and that the outdated apportionments - dating to 1901 - were the vehicle by which rural, conservative interests were allowed to keep a disproportionate influence over the country's politics. Until it was overruled by "Baker", "Colegrove" made it almost impossible for citizens' groups to get help from the federal courts in apportioning legislative and congressional districts.
An exception to the reach of "Colegrove" was allowed in a 1960 case called "Gomillion v. Lightfoot", in which the appellants showed that the boundary lines of a district in Alabama had deliberately been drawn to minimize the voting rights of black residents. Frankfurter wrote the opinion in this case as well, making sure that "Colegrove" would not be seen as allowing blatant racial gerrymandering by recasting the issue as a Fifteenth Amendment case.
One week after "Gomillion"'s ruling was handed down, Justice Black persuaded his colleagues to hear arguments in "Baker", the case which would ultimately overrule "Colegrove".

Rick Vallin

Rick Vallin (September 24, 1919 - August 31, 1977) was an actor who appeared in more than 150 films between 1938 and 1966.
Born Eric Efron in Russia, Vallin came to America while still young. He started his Hollywood career with an uncredited part in the film "Freshman Year". He later joined the Pasadena Playhouse in 1942, and the same year received his first co-star billing in the film "The Panther's Claw" together with Sidney Blackmer, and showed promising leading man material in "Secrets of a Co-Ed" with Otto Kruger. But what was seeming to be a career pointed to stardom, turned later into secondary roles in several B-movies and cliffhanger serials. For the most part, Vallin interpreted the hero's dullish sidekick, a secondary villain, or a prominent ethnic figure. In the minds of studio filmmakers, he had a tight B-movie image and found any advance to the "A" ranks almost impossible.
By the mid-1930s, Vallin had moved considerably down the credits list, until he became a mainstay in the Columbia Pictures serials and appeared in a few of the Bowery Boys 1940s capers. His successful union with Columbia also kept him active in minor roles in three Johnny Weissmuller's "Jungle Jim" movies, playing both sinister villains and savage natives.
Occasionally he showed up in such television series as "Brave Eagle", "Sheriff of Cochise", "Bat Masterson", "Jefferson Drum", "The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok", "The Lone Ranger" and "Wyatt Earp". He was also cast on "The Adventures of Superman", as well in both "The Gene Autry Show" and "The Roy Rogers Show". His last appearance was a guest role on "Daniel Boone" in 1966.
Vallin died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of fifty-seven. He is interred at Eden Memorial Park in Mission Hills, California.

Kenny Omega

Tyson Smith (born October 16, 1983) is a Canadian professional wrestler, best known by his ring name Kenny Omega. He primarily wrestles in Japan for the Dramatic Dream Team promotion, where he is currently in his third reign as one half of the KO-D Tag Team Champions, while also being a former one-time KO-D Openweight Champion, one-time KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Champion and a one-time DDT Extreme Division Champion. He has also worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he is a former AJPW World Junior Heavyweight Champion, and New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he is a former IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion. He has also worked for several North American independent promotions, including California-based Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, where he is a former PWG World Champion and winner of the 2009 Battle of Los Angeles tournament, Ring of Honor, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and Canada-based Premier Championship Wrestling. He was signed to a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment in November 2005 and assigned to Deep South Wrestling, but later asked for and was granted his release in September 2006.
Professional wrestling career.
Early career.
Smith became involved in professional wrestling after he met promoter Bobby Jay while working at a local IGA store. After training with Jay for a year, the 16-year-old Smith began working for Bobby Jay's Top Rope Championship Wrestling in Winnipeg, where over the next two years he eventually developed the gimmick of "Kenny Omega", a Hawaiian surfer. The surfer gimmick was later dropped and replaced with an otaku gamer gimmick, which Smith further accentuated by using the "Hadouken" from Street Fighter.
Premier Championship Wrestling (2001–2005).
In December 2001, Smith joined another local Winnipeg-based promotion, Premier Championship Wrestling. Appearing on the promotion's official launch event, headlined by Eddie Guerrero and attended by 1700 fans, he made an impressive debut against his former trainer Mentallo on March 3, 2002. The match was later named PCW's Match of the Year. Afterwards he went on to form a short lived tag team with Mentallo. By this time, he quickly became a rising star in PCW and the Canadian independent circuit. He was featured in director Guy Maddin's short film "Sissy Boy Slap Party", a teaser for 2003 film "The Saddest Music in the World".
The following year, Omega defeated Adam Knight for the PCW Heavyweight Championship on September 18, 2003. Although successfully defending the title against Chi Chi Cruz, he lost the title to Rawskillz on November 26. While in the Canadian Wrestling Federation later that year, he also won the vacant CWF Heavyweight Championship defeating TJ Bratt in a tournament final on December 29, 2003 before losing the title to Zack Mercury a month later. He also regained the PCW Heavyweight Title from Rwskillz less than two months later, however he was forced to vacate the title on March 18, 2004 after suffering an injury.
Later that year, he teamed with his former rival Rawskillz to defeat Shawn Houston and Chris Raine for the PCW Tag Team Championship on August 19. Their reign was brief, however, as they lost the title back to Houston and Raine the following month. On October 17, 2004, Omega appeared at the National Wrestling Alliance's 56th Anniversary Show, where he unsuccessfully challenged Petey Williams for the TNA X Division Championship.

Omega then briefly formed a tag team with Tommy Suede, which included a loss against Urban Assault on August 3. However, they defeated Matt Striker and Cru Jones one week later. On August 17, Omega lost to Oleg Prudius and, after defeating Cru Jones several days later, he requested his immediate release from his contract to return to Premier Championship Wrestling.

That same day, he was one of several wrestlers in attendance at WSU's first anniversary show in Lake Hiawatha, New Jersey. Others at the event included Steve Mack, Danny Demanto, Ian Rotten, Kevin Matthews, Vicious Vinny, Inferno, Don Johnson.
Omega's first JAPW Heavyweight title defense was on April 19, 2009, at "Spring Massacre", where he retained his title against Frankie Kazarian in a Champions Challenge. He defended his title against Danny Demanto and Grim Reefer during the next few weeks. During his match with the Grim Reefer, Omega's opponent was injured at the start of the match was nearly stopped by the referee twice when Reefer had difficulty breathing.

On January 23, 2011, at "Fantasticamania 2011", a New Japan and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre co–promoted event in Tokyo, Omega and Ibushi lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back to Devitt and Taguchi. On May 26, Omega entered the 2011 Best of the Super Juniors and opened his tournament with a five match win streak, only to lose his last three matches and finish third in his block, narrowly missing the semifinals of the tournament.

Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2008–2010, 2012).
On November 1, 2008, Omega made his Pro Wrestling Guerrilla debut as a villain at the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles, but ended up being eliminated from the tournament in the first round by local talent Brandon Bonham. The next night, Omega was involved in a nine-man three-way tag team match consisting of wrestlers who had lost in the first round. In a memorable moment, during the match he was Irish whipped into the ropes by Davey Richards only for the force to snap the middle and bottom ropes, throwing Omega out of the ring.
Three months later, Omega returned to the company at "Express Written Consent", where he was defeated by El Generico, after senior referee Rick Knox grew tired of Omega abusing him and hit him with a leaping clothesline. On April 11, 2009 at "Ninety-Nine", Omega picked up his first victory in PWG by defeating Davey Richards after a Croyt's Wrath. The following day at PWG's hundredth show, Omega was defeated by Bryan Danielson. At the event, Omega debuted his new tag team partner Chuck Taylor in a backstage segment, where they warned Generico to stay out of Reseda, before he was rescued by Colt Cabana. On May 22, 2009 at the Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament, PWG's annual tag team title tournament, Omega and Taylor, known collectively as The Men of Low Moral Fiber, defeated the re-united Dark & Lovely (Human Tornado and Scorpio Sky) in the first round before being eliminated by the reigning World Tag Team Champions The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) in the semifinals of the tournament. On June 28 at "The Secret of Guerrilla Island", Omega wrestled Roderick Strong first to a double pin finish and then a time limit draw, before refusing to continue the match and walking out. While Omega was touring outside the United States, Taylor defeated El Generico in a street fight on August 28 at "Speed of Sound" to earn the Men of Low Moral Fiber their second shot at the Bucks and the World Tag Team Title. The title match took place on October 2 in the main event of "Against the Grain", where the Bucks once again came out on top.
On November 20, 2009, one year after making his debut for the company, Omega entered his second Battle of Los Angeles, which would this time be contested for the vacant World Championship. In the first round of the tournament, Omega defeated Kevin Steen, who was making his return to the company after a 15 month absence. The following day, he defeated Dynasty members Scott Lost and Joey Ryan in the quarter and semifinal rounds, respectively, to make his way to the finals, where he defeated Roderick Strong to win both the 2009 Battle of Los Angeles and the vacant World Championship. Following his title victory, Omega was attacked by Brian Kendrick and The Young Bucks, who became villains in the process while also turning Omega into a fan favorite, before being saved by his old foes El Generico, Colt Cabana and Rick Knox. Omega and his former rivals decided to put their past differences aside as they now shared a common enemy. On February 27, 2010, at "As the Worm Turns" Omega lost the World Title to Davey Richards in his first defense.
On October 27, 2012, Omega made his first appearance for PWG in over two and a half years, when he teamed with El Generico at "Failure to Communicate" in a tag team match, where they defeated The Young Bucks.

Milija Aleksic

Milija Anthony Aleksic (14 April 1951 – 17 October 2012) was an English football goalkeeper who made 138 league appearances in the Football League.
Released by Port Vale in 1969, he played for Eastwood before lifting the FA Trophy with Stafford Rangers in 1972. The next year he returned to the Football League with Plymouth Argyle, before he was signed by Luton Town in December 1976, following loan spells with Oxford United and Ipswich Town. Three years later he moved on to Tottenham Hotspur, and played in the club's FA Cup victory in 1981. In 1982 he was loaned back to Luton Town, before he went back into non-league football with Barnet. He later migrated to South Africa and played for Wits University.
Playing career.
A goalkeeper born to a Yugoslav father, he grew up in a small Serbian community in Chesterton, Staffordshire; he was a childhood friend of future England international Mike Pejic. His career started with Gordon Lee's Port Vale. He played two FA Cup games for the "Valiants" as a 17-year old in the 1968–69 season, both First Round games with Shrewsbury Town in which he conceding one goal in both the original game and the replay at Vale Park. An emergency replacement for the injured Stuart Sharrat, he was so keen that he used to iron his bootlaces before playing. He was given a free transfer in May 1969 and moved into non-league football with Eastwood, and then Stafford Rangers. With Rangers he was a member of the 1972 FA Trophy winning team, following a 3–0 win over Barnet at Wembley Stadium.
In 1973 he returned to the Football League, signing for Tony Waiters's Plymouth Argyle. The "Pilgrims" posted a 17th place finish in the Third Division in 1973–74, before winning promotion with a second place finish in 1974–75 (they finished one point behind champions Blackburn Rovers). They then held their own in the Second Division, finishing in 16th place in 1975–76. In August 1976, he played two games on loan at Oxford United; both games were League Cup clashes with Cambridge United. He was then loaned out to Ipswich Town. Aleksic left Home Park permanently when he was moved on to league rivals Luton Town in November 1976, who were managed by Harry Haslam. The "Hatters" finished sixth in 1976–77, four points behind promoted Nottingham Forest. Luton then dropped to 13th in 1977–78 under new boss David Pleat, and then finished 18th in 1978–79. He played 77 league games in his three years at Kenilworth Road.
Aleksic was signed by First Division side Tottenham Hotspur in December 1978 for a fee of £100,000. The club posted a 14th place finish in the 1979–80 season under the stewardship of Keith Burkinshaw. He faced competition between the sticks from Barry Daines and Mark Kendall. In one tie against Manchester United, notorious 'hard man' Joe Jordan broke his jaw in what was officially described as an 'accidental collision'. The injury left midfielder Glenn Hoddle to take Aleksic's place in goal for the rest of the match; despite this setback, Hoddle was untroubled in goal, and Spurs won 1–0 with Osvaldo Ardiles scoring the winning goal. The White Hart Lane club made a top ten finish in 1980–81, and also lifted the FA Cup with a 3–2 victory over Manchester City at Wembley. Aleksic featured in both the original tie and the replay, which was won with a brace from Ricardo Villa and a scruffy goal from Garth Crooks. However he soon lost his first team place to Ray Clemence. Spurs went on to finish fourth in 1981–82, but despite being an FA Cup winning goalkeeper just one year previously, he dropped back into non-League football with Barry Fry's Alliance Premier League side Barnet in 1982, following a brief loan spell at former club Luton Town. He later emigrated to South Africa, and played for Wits University, before taking up employment at the Golfer's Club in Johannesburg.
