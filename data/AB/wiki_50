Soldiers Three

Soldiers Three is a collection of short stories by Rudyard Kipling. The three soldiers of the title are Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris, who had also appeared previously in the collection "Plain Tales from the Hills". The current version, dating from 1899 and more fully titled Soldiers Three and other stories, consists of three sections which each had previously received separate publication in 1888; Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris appear only in the first section, which is also titled "Soldiers Three".
Publication history.
The first publication of a collection of seven stories called "Soldiers Three" was as No 1 of A.H. Wheeler & Co.’s Indian Railway Library, a slim volume of 97 pages printed at the “Pioneer” Press, Allahabad in 1888 called "Soldiers Three: a collection of stories setting forth certain passages in the lives and adventures of Privates Terence Mulvaney, Stanley Ortheris and John Learoyd, done into type and edited by Rudyard Kipling". In 1899, it became part of the book "Soldiers Three and Other Stories", known to most people by the simpler title "Soldiers Three". It is this collection whose contents are listed here. To the original "Soldiers Three" were added nos 2 and 3 of the Indian Railway Library, "The Story of the Gadsbys", which is written in dramatic form, and "In Black and White", looking more at the native Indians than the British. Both of these were also published in 1888. (The phrase 'Soldiers Three' may be used in writings about Kipling to group the three heroes of this collection: see Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris.)
"Soldiers Three" (in the Indian Railway Library edition) became the second collection of short stories by Rudyard Kipling to be published, after "Plain Tales from the Hills" (in which the 'Three Soldiers' also appear). Like it, it was collected from some of the fiction he had published in journals; but while "Plain Tales" was mostly collected from the "Civil and Military Gazette", this was "Reprinted in chief from the "Week’s news"", an Allahabad paper.

Badger Pot

Badger Pot and Pigeon Pot are two caves found in the Karst topography on the eastern slopes of Cuilcagh Mountain, south of Florencecourt Forest Park, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.
They are sourced from small rivers which, at each pot, sink below ground. Dye tracing has linked these sinks to the underground river of the "Prod's Pot–Cascades" cave system. This river in turn rises at Cladagh Glen and feeds into the Cladagh River, before ultimately discharging into Upper Lough Erne. 
The dye tracing has also proved a further underground link to Shannon Pot in County Cavan, suggesting that the latter may once have had a substantially larger catchment area.

Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 1901–1904

This is a list of members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly between the 1901 election and the 1904 election, together known as the Fourth Parliament.
The names of parliamentary groupings, which were not formalised parties, were established prior to the 1901 election, with Ministerialists being those sympathetic to former Premier John Forrest, and Oppositionists and Independents defined accordingly. With the exit of Forrest from state politics following his successful shift to the federal Division of Swan, the Ministerial group was defeated in the election and had no obvious choice of leader, but the Opposition, led by George Leake, did not have sufficient numbers to govern in its own right. The failure of the Morgans Ministry in December 1901 after less than a month in office and the unprecedented defeat of three of its Ministers in ministerial by-elections allowed an Opposition-led government with Labour support to govern until the 1904 election with a reasonable level of stability. Therefore, the "Opposition" were in government and the "Ministerial" group was in opposition for most of the period. Bolton and Mozley (1961) introduce the terminology "Forrest party" and "Leake party", but these were not used by either the press or the groupings themselves.

WERT

WERT (1220 AM) is a radio station broadcasting an oldies/adult standards featuring soft oldies chiefly from the 1940s through today. Licensed to Van Wert, Ohio, USA, the station serves Van Wert primarily but is considered part of the Lima market. The station is currently owned by First Family Broadcasting and broadcasts from its studios on the Lincoln Highway (County Highway 418) just east of Van Wert.
History.
From its first day of broadcasting on Thanksgiving Day in November 1958, WERT/1220, then owned by its local founder The Van Wert Broadcasting Company, has traditionally been a middle of the road formatted music station. WERT's original design engineer was also instrumental in the founding of WMVR in Sidney in 1963. The original owners also built and launched WERT-FM/98.9 in 1962, giving Van Wert its own FM service. 
WERT AM and FM were then sold to a California company in 1967 for $160,000, according to an article in that year's Van Wert Times Bulletin newspaper. The west coast firm would absentee own and operate the stations for the next four years. 
Ray Livesay, from Matoon, Il. then purchased the local AM/FM combo in 1971 and operated it throughout much of the 1970s and 80s, boosting the power of WERT-FM to 50,000 watts in 1984. 
1988 saw another change in ownership when Atlantic Resources, based in Cincinnati, Ohio bought the stations for a reported $1 million with intentions to move the high power WERT-FM to Ft. Wayne, Indiana, where it remains today as 98.9 The Bear. WERT was then paired with a new FM station licensed to Paulding, Ohio at 99.7 MHz and sold to Community Broadcasting of Van Wert in 1991.
In 1994 Chris Roberts (previously with WOWO in Fort Wayne) purchased the local stations after forming First Family Broadcasting, Inc.
Programming.
WERT broadcasts a mix of adult standards from the '40s through today from its studios along historic Lincoln Highway. It is the heritage station serving the Van Wert area, and is co-owned with oldies/sports radio station WKSD 99.7 FM in Paulding (formerly WERT-FM; the original WERT-FM/98.9, is now WBYR serving the Fort Wayne market, and is no longer co-owned with WERT).
For many years WERT aired programming from ABC Radio's (now Citadel Media) "Timeless Favorites" format. After "Timeless Favorites" was discontinued in February 2010, the station opted to return to locally originating programming.
A powerful windstorm powered by the remnants of Hurricane Ike caused damage to its transmitting tower on Sunday September 14, 2008. According to a WLIO-TV news story dated September 15, 2008, engineers from the Fort Wayne area along with Chief Engineer Chris Roberts, also the principal owner, worked feverishly to bring the station back on the air. In the interim, WERT continued to operate with reduced power by means of a temporary antenna and an internet audiostream until Friday September 19, 2008 when the new tower was finished. The station returned to full power late in the afternoon on that day as reported by the Van Wert Independent newspaper.

Santiago José Celis

Santiago José Celis (1782 in Ahuachapán - 1814 in San Salvador, El Salvador) was a Salvadoran physician who participated in the 1811 Independence Movement.
Biography.
Celis was born into a Creole family. At a young age he moved to the Guatemalan capital to receive the best possible education of the time. In 1794 he enrolled at the Tridentino School. On the 16 of August 1800 he received the rank of Bachelor of Medicine at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala from which he received his masters degree, finally graduating on 11-12 August 1802. His masters degree was partly achieved by his essays and new ideas for the treatment and evolution of gangrenous inflammations. He married Ana Andrade Canes, a relative of Jose Simeón Canes.
As a doctor he promoted the vaccination against smallpox in San Salvador. As a Creole he was aligned to the cause of the Independence of Central America from the colonial powers and joined the independence movement which reached a high on November 5, 1811 in the capital of San Salvador. Celis, active in the revolutionary movement against the Spanish domination, joined a further uprising on 24 January 1814. Two days later, Celis was captured and jailed in Fijo jail in San Salvador. He was incarcerated for almost three months but due to torture he received in prison, he died on 16 April 1814.

WGFT

WGFT (1330 AM) is a radio station currently silent due to on going technical reasons. Licensed to Campbell, Ohio, USA, the station serves the Youngstown-Warren area. The station is currently owned by Bernard Radio and is pending sale to Y-Town radio broadcasting LLC.
History.
Prior to 1990, the frequency was the second home to WHOT, one of the longest-running Top 40 stations in the country. WHOT relocated to this frequency from the 1570 frequency, enabling it to operate as a full-time station for the first time. After moving both to the FM dial in 1984, and to the 1390 kHz facility on April 23, 1990, the license was re-activated as a separate station, WYWR, that October 8. By July 6, 1992, the station changed its call sign to WZKC, then to WASN on November 15, 1993, and swapping callsigns with WGFT on December 1, 2003.
The station switched from a gospel music format to a talk/personality format in December 2007. The WGFT calls refer to the station's former gospel music format ("The Gift"), which now resides on sister station WASN AM 1500. It was a full-time station until around 2000, when their night power was voluntarily relinquished. However, their web streaming now operates on a 24-hour basis, along with sister station (and fellow daytimer) WGFT.
In addition to Don Imus, Laura Ingraham, Dave Ramsey, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin, the station featured a local daily talk radio show hosted by Louie Free. Free's show originated on sister station WASN until January 1, 2010, when WASN changed from a Hispanic and gospel music format to carry urban-oriented news/talk programming; Free would later move to WYCL and WHTX the following year.
WGFT changed formats to classic hits early in 2012.
In February 2013 WGFT and sister station WASN was taken off air due to on-going technical reasons with a sta to return to the air by Feb 2014.
In June 2013, an application was filed with the FCC for WGFT to be rebroadcast on 94.3 FM owned by HELEN M. BEDNARCZYK, wife of WGFT and WASN general manager Ted "Skip" BEDNARCZYK.
On March 2014, WGFT will launch a Urban adult contemporary format being simulcast on Niles FM W232AI 93.7.

Learoyd, Mulvaney and Ortheris

"Mulvaney, Ortheris, and Learoyd are Privates in B Company of a Line regiment, and personal friends of mine." —("The Three Musketeers") 
Thus Rudyard Kipling introduces, in the story "The Three Musketeers" (1888) three characters who were to reappear in many stories, and to give their name to his next collection "Soldiers Three". Their characters are given in the sentence that follows: "Collectively, I think, but am not certain, they are the worst men in the regiment so far as genial blackguardism goes"—that is, they are 'trouble' to authority, and always on the lookout for petty gain; but Kipling is at pains never to suggest that they are evil or immoral. They are representative of the admiration he has for the British Army—which he never sought to idealise as in any way perfect—as in the poems collected in "Barrack-Room Ballads" (1892), and also show his interest in, and respect for the 'uneducated' classes. Kipling has great respect for the independence of mind, initiative and common sense of the three—and their cunning.
The three are distinguished by their accents, and by Kipling's skilful use of standard stereotyping. If money is to be discussed, it will be done by Learoyd, the caricature Yorkshireman always careful with "brass"; Mulvaney, the Irishman, is the most talkative; and the cockney Ortheris is the most 'street-wise'. But each is much more than a caricature or mere stereotype: that aspect of their construction is partly a question of the economy Kipling has to use in these short pieces, and partly an aspect of his presentation of himself as an ingenuous young reporter.
Mulvaney.
Private Terence Mulvaney (whose surname should be pronounced Mulvanny) is the leader of the three. He is an Irishman: his speech is distinguished by certain obvious dialect characteristics, even if the dialect is to some extent 'stage Irish'. His 't's and 'd's are often aspirated (indicated by a following 'h', as in 'dhrinkin''); the strength of his pronunciation of 'wh-' is often indicated by preceding it with 'f' ("fwhat" for 'what'); his 's' is often followed by an 'h' (as in 'pershuade' - or is this his drink talking?); the different quality of his vowels from the Received Pronunciation of his day is indicated by variant spellings. For example, 
Thin I became a man, an' the divil of a man I was fifteen years ago. They called me Black Mulvaney in thim days, an', begad, I tuk a woman's eye. I did that! Ortheris, ye scrub, fwhat are ye sniggerin' at? Do you misdoubt me?
This shows not only the spelling of his speech, but indicates the articulate fluency with which he speaks (as an Irishman, of course, he has 'the gift of the gab') and also demonstrates, if read aloud, Kipling's feeling for the rhythms and 'swing' of Irish English. It also has the word 'misdoubt', which is more local than Standard English.
Mulvaney is also representative of the stereotypical Irishman in that he drinks, and has lost all his good conduct pay and badges; but he is less typical in that he is an exemplary soldier in what he (and Kipling) thinks is important: he may be regularly Confined to Barracks for his misdemeanours (mostly for being drunk and disorderly)—he thinks this is fair enough - but he supports army traditions ("The Three Musketeers" shows him defending the tradition of Thursday half day working, more successfully that the rest of the regiment) and resents some "cruel bad treatment" by the Colonel in The God from the Machine: "Me that have saved the repitation av a ten times better man than him".
"He was the tallest man in the regiment" ("The God from the Machine")
Opinions of others.

1811 Independence Movement

The 1811 Independence Movement known in El Salvador as the Primer grito de independencia (First Shout of Independence) was the first of a series of revolts in Central America in El Salvador against Spanish colonialism and dependency on the Captaincy General of Guatemala.
Antecedents.
At the beginning of the 19th century, agitation grew in the American territories dominated by the Spanish crown. The previous century was dominated by the growing support of ideas of individual freedom, which characterized the Enlightenment that took place in Europe and the Americas. Most influential was the American Revolution, with the resulting liberation of the British North American colonies, and the French Revolution, which seeded the restlessness and search for freedom in the Spanish American territories under dominion of the Spaniards. 
In the Intendancy of San Salvador (covering roughly the same territory as today's El Salvador), many Creoles and other settlers wanted to separate control of the colony from the Guatemalan Captaincy General. This was largely due to economic and political reasons. Greater administrative autonomy or outright independence for San Salvador would reduce the high level of taxes paid to the Spain and Guatemala and would raise finances for the colony. Napoleón Bonaparte's invasion of Spain in 1808 and the removal of Ferdinand VII from the Spanish throne created an atmosphere of unrest in San Salvador.
Revolt in San Salvador.
The insurrectionists organized themselves along with prominent middle-class supporters of the cause of independence such as doctors and priests who took part in the event. These included doctors such as Santiago José Celis, the brothers (Nicholas, Vicente and Manuel Aguilar) and the priest José Matías Delgado. Others included Manuel José Arce, Juan Manuel Rodríguez and Pedro Pablo Castillo.
On November 5 the revolt began in San Salvador. According to tradition, the rebels waited for a signal from the bell tower of the Church of La Merced, but this did not occur on the scheduled time. The rebels later assembled on the town square outside the church where Manuel José Arce proclaimed in front of the public: "There is no King, nor Intendant, nor Captain General. We only must obey our "alcaldes"," meaning that since Ferdinand VII had been deposed, all other officials appointed by him no longer legitimately held power. A tumult in the square grew to the point that the intendant, Antonio Gutierrez y Ulloa, asked that the gathered name somebody to formally receive their demands. Manuel José Arce himself was chosen and selected as the leader by the crowd. Despite this, the insurrectionists took arms and proclaimed the total independence of San Salvador from the Spanish crown, but were later subdued.
In the following days, the independence movement extended to the cities of Santiago Nonualco, Usulután, Chalatenango, Santa Ana, Tejutla and Cojutepeque. The two other notable revolts occurred on November 24 in the city of Metapán and on December 20 in Sensuntepeque.
Suppression and aftermath.
Despite the efforts of the insurrectionists, the cause of independence was not shared by the city councils of the Intendancy . Neither San Miguel, nor San Vicente nor Santa Ana joined them. Unable to amass support, the rebels decided to negotiate with a delegation sent in from the Guatemalan capital to take control. The new Intendant Colonel Jose de Aycinena, arrived on December 8 with Guatemalan troops and priests to force them to swear obedience to the crown and reclaimed the city. The new government was well received by the majority of the population due to Aycinena's policy of understanding and nonconfrontation. However, several days later, unrest broke out in the neighboring Intendancy of Nicaragua, where uprisings broke out in León on December 13 and later in Granada on December 22. Nevertheless, both were soon suppressed. 
Many of those involved in the events in El Salvador and Nicaragua were incarcerated, but José Matías Delgado was taken back with the delegation to Guatemala City. Despite his past activities, or perhaps because of them, Delgado was elected in 1813 as a representative on the Provincial Deputation of Guatemala created by the Spanish Constitution of 1812. He also became director of the Tridentino Seminary in the capital city, therefore, he was not in El Salvador at the time of the second insurrection in 1814, and so did not take part in it. 
He was once again elected provincial deputy in 1820 when the Spanish Constitution was restored, and on September 15, 1821, he was among those who signed the Act of the Independence of Central America in Guatemala City. On November 28, 1821 he became political chief ("jefe pólitico civil") of the Province of San Salvador, and as its executive officer, he led its separation from Guatemala to prevent the former intendancy from becoming part of First Mexican Empire. Arce later became president of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1825 to 1829, once full independence from both Spain and Mexico became a reality.

Coptic Orthodox Church in North America

The Copts began to immigrate to the United States as early as the late 1940s. Immigration to Canada was soon to follow, and in general, this was to be the case throughout North America in the coming decades. With hundreds of Coptic Orthodox churches in the United States alone (along with over 90 congregations in Canada), it is estimated that there are over one million Coptic Orthodox Christians in North America.
While the Coptic Orthodox form a larger number in the US, the first Coptic Orthodox parish in the North America was actually founded in Canada. In 1964, St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church in (Toronto, Canada) was established. However, not too long afterwards, the first parish in the States, St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church (Jersey City) was founded in the late 1960s.
Decades later, Mexico had a growing Coptic Orthodox community of its own, as it was less than one decade ago when some Coptic families settled in Mexico. The first — and only — Coptic Orthodox church in Mexico is St. Mary and St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church in Tlaycapan, Mexico. It was founded in 2001.
Of the Coptic Orthodox parishes in the United States, there are currently over 200 churches that serve the expanding Coptic Orthodox population there. Florida, is home to many Coptic Orthodox Christians, and there are currently 21 established churches throughout the state, in order to serve the large and growing Egyptian-Christian population arising all over the state. There are many churches in North America as well as several other churches and communities in Canada.

Roger Godberd

Roger Godberd was a medieval outlaw who has been suggested as a possible historical basis for the legend of Robin Hood.
Godberd served under Simon de Montfort, the 6th Earl of Leicester, as well as two other barons. 
In 1265 Godberd was outlawed for fighting against King Henry III in the Battle of Evesham. Nearly two centuries later, in about 1446, Walter Bower claimed that Robin Hood also became an outlaw as a result of this battle.
In October 1267, Godberd settled in Sherwood Forest. He lived there for four years defying the authorities. He could call upon a hundred men, but was eventually caught in 1272. 
Reginald de Grey was the Sheriff of Nottingham at this time. Godberd was captured in the grounds of Rufford Abbey, and from there taken to Nottingham Castle, but managed to escape. A prominent local knight named Richard Foliot helped Godberd and his fellow fugitives, and protected them from the Sheriff. 
In 1270 Foliot's Castle Fenwick was besieged by royal troops under the command of Reginald de Grey, who intended to capture Godberd and his companions, but the outlaws managed to flee before the Sheriff's arrival. In 1272 Foliot was accused for his protection of Godberd, and had to surrender Fenwick. This knight resembles the figure of Richard at the Lee in the ballads of the Robin Hood story.
Godberd was eventually captured and sent to jail. He was kept in three different prisons over three years while awaiting his trial, which took place at the Tower of London and at which he was pardoned upon the return of Edward I from the Eighth Crusade. He returned to his farm, and lived there until his death. However, according to the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", Godberd died in Newgate Prison in 1276.

How betraying a friend or an acquaintance can ruin ones life is poignantly depicted in the Malayalam film Thalappavu made by actor-turned-director Madhupal. The movie is based on a real-life confession of a police constable about gunning down a naxalite in a fake encounter as per the order of his superiors nearly thirty years ago. The screenplay by Babu Janardhanan uses the stream of consciousness flow to show the mental state of the constable who feels deranged after the incident. Lal plays Constable Raveendran Pillai whose family life is ruined after the killing of Joseph (Prithviraj), a revolutionary leader fighting for the rights of the hapless farmers of Wayanad. Raveendran is a misfit in the police force as he is not courageous or cruel as the others of his ilk. He is a family man to the hilt and dotes on his children. He befriends Joseph on the way while on duty. Joseph introduces him to the revolutionary ideas. Raveendran takes instant liking for Joseph and roams in the forests with Joseph during his free time.

Werner Faymann

Werner Faymann (; born 4 May 1960) is an Austrian politician who has been Chancellor of Austria and chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) since 2008.
Early life and education.
Born in Vienna, Austria, he studied law at the University of Vienna for two years but did not graduate.
Career.
From 1985 to 1988 Faymann was a consultant at the Zentralsparkasse Bank (now Bank Austria), which he left to become director and provincial chairman of the Viennese Tenants' counselling. He was also provincial chairman of Socialist Youth Vienna (Sozialistische Jugend Wien) from 1985 until 1994, when he became a member of the Viennese state parliament and municipal council; where he held various positions concerning housing construction and urban renewal.
Faymann was Federal Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology in the Cabinet of Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer. On 16 June 2008 Faymann succeeded Gusenbauer as chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) and led the party in the snap legislative elections, held on 28 September 2008. The election was famously preceded by Faymann and Gusenbauer together announcing a shift in the party's position towards the signing of new EU treaties, which they did by writing an open letter to Hans Dichand, the editor of the yellow press medium Kronen Zeitung, the largest newspaper in the country. This caused a scandal within the party, because the shift was not decided by any party committee, and led the pro-EU Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) to end the existing coalition, thus causing the elections. Faymann was known for his good relationship with the now-deceased Dichand, who would also support him in the following election campaign. Although the SPÖ lost 11 seats, and had a 6% swing against it (in fact, their worst result since World War II), they came ahead of their main rivals Austrian People's Party with regard to seats (57 to 51) as well as to share of the vote (29.26% to 25.98%). Afterwards, Faymann renewed the coalition with the Austrian People's Party, as he had announced before the election.
Chancellor.
As head of the largest party in the National Council of Austria, Faymann was asked by Federal President Heinz Fischer on 8 October 2008 to form a new Government.
A coalition was agreed upon on 23 November 2008, between the SPÖ and the ÖVP and it was sworn in on 2 December 2008.
In domestic affairs, Faymann's administration has been notable in enacting a wide range of progressive reforms in areas such as education and social security.
Private life.
Faymann is a Roman Catholic. He is married and has two children.

Atlas (DC Comics)

Atlas is the name of several fictional characters, comic book superheroes and deities published by DC Comics. Jack Kirby's Atlas debuted in "1st Issue Special" #1, (April 1975), and was created by Jack Kirby.
Publication history.
The very first Golden Age version of a character named Atlas in DC Comics occurred in "Action Comics" #121 (June 1948). The second appearance of an Atlas was in "Action Comics" #320 (January 1965). And the third appearance of an Atlas was in "Action Comics" #353 (August 1967).
The Jack Kirby Atlas' first and only appearance prior to Superman #677 was in "1st Issue Special" #1. James Robinson brought Atlas back in "Superman" #678. According to Robinson, Atlas is going to save humanity. "The way I like to look at him is like in the Marvel Universe, Namor is a hero but he really skates the fine line between being a hero and a villain, but he stays on the side of the hero. Atlas, skates that line between hero and villain but he ultimately always falls on the villain side." He continued to say that Atlas will become a major player in the Superman mythos moving forward and there will be some real twists to the character.
One of the earlier characters named Atlas re-appeared in Grant Morrison's "All-Star Superman", a version of Atlas appears in issue 3. This Atlas is more closely based on the mythological figure of Atlas, and competes with Superman and Samson to "win" Lois Lane, similar to the story in Action Comics #320 from January 1965.
Fictional character biography.
The Jack Kirby Atlas' family and people were slain by the raiders of Hyssa the Lizard King. Atlas was raised by a wise and mysterious traveller named Chagra. Because of an alien crystal carried by Atlas, Chagra theorized that Atlas was one of the people of the Crystal Mountain. Chagra agrees to help Atlas achieve his revenge, but only if Atlas leads him to the Crystal Mountain. Atlas grew up to become a protector of the innocent, but once King Hyssa was defeated, his petulance and darker nature came to the forefront.
Atlas returns in "Superman" #677 as part of "The Coming of Atlas" storyline and his origin is retold in issue #678 where he is seen saving citizens of Metropolis he himself had endangered. He is currently working with a secret government project that intends to kill Superman. Atlas wants to defeat Superman and replace him as Metropolis' champion on his way to conquer the modern world. He fights the Science Police and Superman.
Atlas' return and fight with Superman was described as part of a ruse intended to test Project 7734, a governmental project that utilizes magic in an effort to kill Superman, who is vulnerable to magic. Atlas continues to work for this project.
Atlas is later kidnapped and brainwashed into fighting the Justice League by an unknown party. After being defeated by the team, Atlas explains to Batman that he has no idea who captured him in the first place.
In other media.
Television.
A Robot Named Atlas appeared in Teen Titans (TV series)

Tamdhu distillery

Tamdhu distillery is a single malt Scotch Speyside whisky distillery, located in the town of Knockando in Banffshire, Scotland.
Tamdhu comes from Gaelic for "little dark hill".
The distillery was founded in 1897 by a group of assemblers, wishing to engage in the production of their own whisky. It quickly passed on into the hands of Highland Distillers. The history of the distillery was fairly quiet, without changing owners, but still marked by a long dormancy between 1927 and 1947.
Its production capacity was tripled between 1972 and 1975. The distillery has now 3 wash stills and 3 spirit stills. Its annual production of pure alcohol is 4 million gallons.
Unlike its neighbors the Tamdhu distillery has no roof-shaped pagoda above its malt furnaces. This is one of the last distilleries to malt all of its barley on the spot by a mechanical saladin.
The Tamdhu whisky is almost completely used for the production of blended whiskies, such as The Famous Grouse, J & B and Cutty Sark. Tamdhu's traditional single malt bottling does not mention its age, but a recent addition to its product line includes a 10 year old distillery bottling. Other single malts are sold by independent bottlers.
It was announced that as of April 2010, the Tamdhu Distillery, belonging to the Highland Distillers subsidiary of the Edrington Group, was being closed and the plant shuttered. It was then sold to Ian MacLeod Distillers in June 2011, who recommenced production of single malt in May 2013.

Muhammad had been named heir apparent by his father, Husayn I, Bey of Tunis, in 1725. In 1735 his father was ousted by his nephew Ali I Pasha, who in 1735 named Muhammad as governor of Sousse.
With the help of the dey of Algiers, in 1756 Muhammad attacked Tunis and overthrew Ali. The division of the booty caused however strife between Muhammad and the Algerian commander, the dey of Constantine. Muhammad fled to the fortified city of Bardo, while brother Ali went to Sfax to raise troops. In the meantime the Turkish garrison of Tunis, with the support of the Algerians, set up a revolutionary government, establishing a terror regime which lasted for several weeks.
The rebellers, backed by Algerian troops, besieged him, but were defeated by Ali's disciplined and better organized forces. The Algerians were convinced to return to their homeland after the payment of a large indemnity and of a yearly tribute.
Thenceforth Muhammad and Ali reigned jointly, the latter succeeding to the throne after Muhammad's death in 1759.

Abu l-Hasan Ali I

Abu l-Hasan Ali I (; 30 June 1688 – 22 September 1756) was the second leader of the Husainid Dynasty and the ruler of Tunisia from 1735 until his death.
Biography.
He was a grandson of Ali Turki, governor of Kef, and the nephew of Husayn I Bey. After the latter came to power in 1705, he was appointed governor of Sousse and then named heir apparent (1706). In 1724 he obtained the title of pasha by the Ottoman sultan.
Two year later, Husayn replaced him as heir with his son Muhammad; Ali therefore revolted, and, with the help of the dey of Algiers, defeated Husayn in 1735. Soon after his entrance in Tunis, however, he was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Algerian troops camped under the city's walls, amounting to the load of 35 mules in silver, and to promise a yearly tribute of 50,000 rials to the dey.
Husayn, who had fled to Kairouan and tried to keep governing on Sousse and the Tunisian Sahel. Ali ordered his son Younes to besiege him. Husayn was captured and executed in 1740, but the latter's sons, Muhammad and Ali, fled and continued the civil war, one from Constantine and the other from Algiers.
In 1741 Ali conquered the island of Tabarka from the Republic of Genoa, deporting 1,500 Christians to Tunis. In the same year he sent an expedition against the French Cap Nègre, which was captured by his son Younes.
In his late years Ali had to face two rebellions. The first one was that led by Younes himself, who was able to seize Tunis, having the local authorities to proclaim him bey. Ali besieged him in the citadel, and forced him to flee to Algiers. The second came from the sons of Husayn, who were able to gain support from the dey of Algiers and invaded Tunisia with an army led by the dey of Constantine. The army reached Tunis, whose walls Ali had restored and strengthened with a ditch in the meantime. However, this did not prevent the Algerians to storm the city on 31 August 1756. Ali was deposed on the following 2 September and brought in chain to Algiers, where he was stripped naked and strangled twenty days later by partisans of his successor Muhammad I ar-Rashid.

Geoffrey de Gorham

Geoffrey de Gorham (Goreham, Gorron), sometimes called Geoffrey of Dunstable or of Le Mans (d. at St Albans, 26 February 1146), was a Norman scholar who became Abbot of St Albans Abbey, 1119 to 1146.
Life.
He was from the province of Maine, then annexed to the Dukedom of Normandy. He was invited by Richard d'Aubeney, Abbot of St Albans, to become master of the Abbey school. On his arrival, he found that owing to his long delay another had been appointed, whereupon he opened a school at Dunstable. 
He staged a miracle play on St. Katherine. A chronicle relates how he had borrowed some copes from St Albans Abbey for the performance, but had the misfortune to lose his books and the copes in a fire at his house in the night after the performance. To make up to God and the saint for the loss of the copes, he determined to become a monk of St Albans Abbey. 
Here he rose to be prior, and finally was elected abbot on the death of Richard, in 1119. He ruled for twenty-six years, and the abbey prospered. He succeeded in saving the Abbey when it was threatened with destruction during the Anarchy during the reign of King Stephen.
He added to the building an infirmary with chapel attached, and spent large sums on a new shrine to which he translated the body of St Alban, 2 August 1129. 
Geoffrey endowed the nunnery at Sopwell, and founded another at Markyate, in Hertfordshire, for his friend and counsellor, Christina of Markyate the recluse. He also opened a leper hospital near St Albans.

<doc id="18690012" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18690012" title="John A. Ryan">
John A. Ryan

John Augustine Ryan (1869–1945) was a leading Catholic priest who was a noted moral theologian, professor, author and advocate of social justice. Ryan lived during a decisive moment in the development of Catholic social teaching within the United States. The largest influx of immigrants in America’s history, the emancipation of American slaves, and the industrial revolution had produced a new social climate in the early twentieth century, and the Catholic Church faced increasing pressure to take a stance on questions of social reform.
Ryan saw the social reform debate of the early twentieth century as essentially an argument between libertarian individualists and collectivists concerned with equality, and thus contended that an emphasis on human welfare framed in natural law theory provided the most promising means to combine conflicting concerns over individual and social welfare. Ryan’s influential response was the development of a Catholic critique of the American capitalist system that emphasized the existence of absolute natural human rights.
While Ryan identified himself primarily as a moral theologian, he also made important contributions to American political life and economic thought. He supported a number of social reforms that were eventually incorporated into the New Deal, and have become elemental to the modern welfare state. Ryan’s most well-known contribution to American economic thought was his argument for a minimum wage presented in his doctoral dissertation, "A Living Wage".
Ryan recognized the importance of a “synergistic relation among scholarship, moral teaching, and political activism,” which led to his vigorous application of moral thinking to the political arena.
Early life.
Ryan was born on May 25, 1869, in Vermillion, Minnesota, to William Ryan and Maria Luby. Raised in the Populist tradition on a farm homesteaded by his Irish Catholic parents alongside his ten younger siblings, Ryan’s childhood experience with the challenges faced by farmers informed his early investment in economic justice and the role of the Catholic Church in promoting social change.
Ryan’s interest in moral reflection on contemporary economic issues and empathy for the poor was further cultivated in his early teenage years when Ryan read Henry George’s "Progress and Poverty". While Ryan later confessed to not fully understanding the book at the time, he cites his first reading of George’s work as the beginning of a lifelong commitment to questions of social justice.
Education and academic life.
Ryan attended secondary school at the Christian Brothers School in 1887, and continued his studies at the St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota, now named the University of St. Thomas. He graduated valedictorian of his class in 1892. Ryan was a member of the inaugural class at the St. Paul Seminary in 1894, which is now the School of Divinity of the University of St. Thomas. Graduating in 1898, Ryan received his holy orders from Archbishop John Ireland of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. With Ireland's permission, he then moved to Washington, D.C., to pursue graduate studies at the Catholic University of America the same year. At the Catholic University of America, Ryan received his licentiate in literature in 1900 and his Doctorate of Sacred Theology in 1906.
Ryan saw his own vocation as the teaching of moral theology and economic justice to the American electorate, emphasizing in particular his influence on Catholic voters and politicians. While much of his instruction emerged from the numerous articles and pamphlets he wrote throughout his lifetime, Ryan also held official professorships. He taught moral theology at the St. Paul Seminary from 1902–1915, and then returned to Washington where he served as a professor at the Catholic University from 1915 until 1939, teaching graduate level courses in moral theology, industrial ethics and sociology. During his tenure at the Catholic University, Ryan also taught economics and social ethics at Trinity College in Washington, now known as Trinity Washington University.
Economic thought.
Ryan viewed the separation of economic thought from religious and ethical rules as the root of practical economic problems faced by Americans in the early half of the twentieth century. While at St. Paul Seminary in 1894, Ryan read Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical "Rerum Novarum" in which he found Leo’s statement that all laborers had a right to adequate worldly goods in order to live in frugal comfort, and the state was obliged to guarantee that right.
In 1902, "American Catholic Quarterly Review" published Ryan's essay, "The Morality of the Aims and Methods of Labor Unions," a piece supportive of unions.
Ryan's licentiate dissertation, "Some Ethical Aspects of Speculation," investigated the morality of speculation. His Ph.D. dissertation was an influential early economic and moral argument for minimum wage legislation. It was published as "A Living Wage" in 1906. Ryan insisted in the text that all men had a right to a living wage, adequate to support himself and his family. Always grounding his political thought in moral theology, Ryan argued that "Rerum Novarum" converted the living wage “from an implicit to an explicit principle of Catholic ethics.” 
Published in 1916, Ryan’s second major scholarly work was the book "Distributive Justice: The Right and Wrong of Our Present Distribution of Wealth", in which he provided an examination of rent from land, interest on capital, profits from enterprise, and wages for labor in relation to moral principles. As with "A Living Wage," Ryan drew on both ethical and economic reasoning; he claimed that all four agents of production — the worker, entrepreneur, capitalist, and landowner — had a claim to the finished product because each contributed an indispensable element to its production. Ryan further objected at a practical and moral level to both the Puritan industrial ethic and the “gospel of consumption” that encouraged increased consumption through the production of new forms of demand, such as luxury goods and services. Ryan again saw both these flawed economic views as the outcome of an historic separation between ethics and economic life. Ryan based his own vision of economic progress in America on equitable wealth distribution, decreased working hours, and a guaranteed minimum wage. Clear in Ryan’s economic thought was a disciplined commitment to both ethical and practical analysis of his country's economic problems.
While "A Living Wage" has achieved a higher degree of recognition, Ryan stated in his autobiography, “"Distributive Justice" is unquestionably the most important book I have written.” 
In these early publications Ryan staked out an economic position that maintained the primacy of private property but spurned overly acquisitive and unregulated free market capitalism as economically unhealthy and morally bankrupt. He would argue this economic philosophy for his entire life.
Public life.
Just as Ryan’s economic thought was guided by a commitment to moral theology, his political action was inextricably connected to his religious beliefs. Though Ryan was primarily an intellectual and moral theologian, his deep conviction that the church had a proper role to play in public affairs led him to maintain a consistent engagement in American politics throughout his lifetime. Ryan avoided political labels such as “liberal” or “conservative,” but eventually settled on “papalist” to describe his public position, meaning “an orthodox commitment to the Holy See.” Ryan viewed the proper role of the state as the active promotion of the common good only to the extent that it cannot be realized through the family or voluntary associations. Ryan was among the earliest advocates of minimum wage laws in the United States.
Program for social reconstruction.
Aside from his influential texts "A Living Wage" and "Redistributive Justice", and a number of other political and economic pamphlets, Ryan authored the “Program for Social Reconstruction” in 1919, a text that was adopted by the Administrative Committee of the National Catholic War Council as a statement of their social and economic objectives and became the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. A number of authors have cited the text as a blueprint for the New Deal legislation, though others have also stated that such connections have been exaggerated. However direct Ryan’s influence was on the New Deal, the text offered liberal social reforms that emphasized an active role for the state in promoting social justice, many of which were enacted during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. Yet, the text also involved a number of less successful reforms that defy popular interpretations of Ryan as a strictly liberal political thinker, such as a federal ban on the dissemination of information on birth control and rigid support for abortion laws. What is most evident in the “Program for Social Reconstruction” is Ryan’s systematic application of Catholic ethics to social reconstruction.
Political activities.
Beyond authoring political texts, Ryan also took a number of decisively political actions. While teaching at St. Paul Seminary, Ryan took an active interest in trade unions, promoting their cause to outside groups, addressing union gatherings, and helping to author and promote social legislation.
In 1923, Ryan initiated the Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems.
After teaching at the Catholic University, Ryan became head of the Social Action Department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, a position that allowed him substantial opportunities to influence politicians in Washington. He was a noted supporter of the failed Child Labor Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite opposition from the influential Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal William Henry O'Connell.
Ryan also worked actively with the National Consumers’ League, which attempted to encourage consumers to push for decent working conditions. In 1927, Ryan founded the Catholic Association for International Peace.
Ryan was such a fervent supporter of the New Deal that he was nicknamed "Monsignor New Deal".
1n 1931, Ryan urged the federal government to develop a $5 billion public works campaign.
In 1933, the Roosevelt administration enlisted Ryan's assistance in mustering support among Catholic clerics for its NRA codes. In 1934, Ryan was elected to the three-person Industrial Appeals Board of the National Recovery Administration.
One of Ryan’s most controversial ventures into American politics was his national radio endorsement of Democratic Party candidate Franklin Roosevelt when he ran for re-election as President in 1936. When the "Radio Priest", Father Charles E. Coughlin, turned vehemently against FDR and the New Deal during the 1936 presidential campaign, and encouraged his listeners to vote instead for William Lemke of Coughlin's new Union Party, Ryan countered with an overtly partisan political speech ("Roosevelt Safeguards America") broadcast on national radio on October 8, 1936, urging Catholics to repudiate Coughlin and support the New Deal and Roosevelt. Wary of the potential controversy his speech could arouse, he began the endorsement by stating, “I am making tonight what is liable to be called a political speech. It is not that. It is mainly a discussion of certain political events in the light of moral law.” Nevertheless, the endorsement led Ryan into open conflict with Coughlin, who gave Ryan the sarcastic sobriquet “The Right Reverend New Dealer." The speech also cost Ryan the confidence of Archbishop Michael J. Curley of Baltimore.
Reception.
During his lifetime, Ryan met fierce criticism for his economic and political thought. He was at times labeled a socialist for his endorsement of policies such as public housing, social security, unemployment insurance, and women’s rights in the work place, as well as his critique of unregulated free market capitalism. Refusing to prescribe to either a liberal or conservative political doctrine, instead choosing to support policies based on his theological beliefs, Ryan displeased both liberal and conservative politicians at times. Ryan’s overtly political acts also earned him disapproval within the Catholic Church.
Yet Ryan was also a deeply respected moral theologian throughout his lifetime. With his position with the NCWC, he was authorized by the Bishops as their principal Catholic spokesman for social reform within the United States, and became the first Catholic priest to deliver the benediction at a presidential inauguration in 1937.
Death and legacy.
After a short illness, Ryan died on September 16, 1945, in his home state of Minnesota. He is remembered today as an early and essential advocate for social reform in the first half of the twentieth century. He maintains a unique role in the history of the American Catholic tradition as a pioneer in the application of Catholic theology to questions of social justice in industrial society.
The John A. Ryan Institute for Catholic Social Thought at University of St. Thomas explores the relationship between the Catholic social tradition and business theory and practice by fostering a deeper integration of faith and work.

Strategic Rocket Forces (North Korea)

The Strategic Rocket Forces (Chosŏn'gŭl: 조선인민군 전략로케트군, Hanja: 朝鮮人民軍 戰略로케트軍), also known as Missile Guidance Bureau (Chosŏn'gŭl: 미사일지도국; Hanja: 미사일指導局) is the strategic missile forces of North Korea. The SMF is a major division of the Korean People's Army that controls North Korea's nuclear and conventional strategic missiles. It is mainly equipped with surface-to-surface missiles of Soviet and Chinese design, as well as locally developed long-range missiles.
History.
Shortly after Kim Il-Sung's October 5, 1966, instructions to develop the military and economy jointly, the Second Machine Industry Ministry, under the Korean Workers Party secretary in charge of military industries, was established to manage the procurement and production of weapons. Some sources assert that North Korea had begun the production of multiple rocket launchers in the early 1960s, but by 1965 Kim Il-sŏng had probably made the political decision to establish an indigenous missile production capability after the Soviets rebuffed his request for ballistic missiles. Nevertheless, during the 1960s the Soviet Union began to provide free rockets over ground (FROGs), surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and coastal defense antiship missiles, which exposed North Korean engineers to basic technologies for rocket propulsion, guidance, and related missile systems. And in 1965, North Korea founded the Hamhŭng Military Academy, which began to train North Korean personnel in rocket and missile development. By 1970, North Korea had received surface-to-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles from China, but Pyongyang was also seeking assistance to establish its own missile development program.
In September 1971, North Korea signed an agreement with China to acquire, develop, and produce ballistic missiles, but significant bilateral cooperation did not begin until about 1977 when North Korean engineers participated in a joint development program for the DF-61, which was supposed to be a liquid-fueled ballistic missile with a range of about 600km and a 1,000kg warhead. The program was cancelled in 1978 because of Chinese domestic political reasons.
Around this same time, Pyongyang was also seeking Soviet missiles and technology. The DPRK did receive Soviet-made Scud-B ballistic missiles, but the timing of the acquisition is unclear. One North Korean defector has asserted that the Soviet Union provided about 20 Scud-Bs in 1972, but this claim has not been substantiated and is probably not credible. 
By 1984, the DPRK had produced and flight-tested its Hwasong-5, which reportedly has a range of 320km compared to the Scud-B’s 300km; the extra 20km is attributed to improvements in the missile’s propulsion system and not a reduction in the mass of the warhead. Just as North Korea was beginning to manufacture the Hwasŏng-5, Tehran approached Pyongyang in 1985 to purchase the missile for use in the “war of the cities” with Iraq. North Korea began to construct missile bases for the Hwasŏng-5 around 1985-86, just before the missile went into serial production around 1987. North Korea’s ballistic missile development then accelerated at a fast pace; as soon as mass production of the Hwasŏng-5 began, North Korea began developing the Hwasŏng-6 (火星-6 or Scud-C), the Rodong (commonly known as Nodong-1), the Paektusan-1 (白頭山-1; commonly known as the Taepodong-1), the Paektusan-2 (白頭山-2; commonly known as the Taepodong-2), and the Musudan. 
Despite the difficulties of missile development and the fact that other countries had tried and failed to develop medium- and intermediate-range missiles, North Korea began to produce Rodong prototypes around the same time it was beginning mass production of the Hwasŏng-6 (Scud-C). The first Rodong deployments were in February 1995, even though the system only had two flight tests--one catastrophic failure and one successful flight at a reduced range. In 1999 different missile units, which were subordinate to the KPA Ground Force Artillery Command, were re-organized into a single missile force - the Missile Guidance Bureau. It would be only in 2012 when Kim Jong-un referred to the service as the Strategic Rocket Forces during his commemorative address honoring the centennial year of Kim Il-sung's birth.
Organization.
The Strategic Rocket Forces is a branch of the KPA, and is directly subordinate to the supreme commander.
Facilities.
There are other numerous smaller sites, scattered around the country, serving for mobile launcher pads. Some larger sites are under construction.
Active Missiles.
Detailed listings of the equipment holdings of the Korean People's Army are rather scarce in unclassified literature. North Korea operates the FROG-7, Hwasong-5 (NK built Scud-B), Hwasong-6 (NK built Scud-C), Rodong-1, SCUD-ER. The U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center reported in 2009 that the Rocket Forces had fewer than 100 launchers for Tochka and Hwasong-5/6 SRBMs, and fewer than 50 launchers for the Rodong-1. Rather speculative estimates are given in the following table:
Additionally, there are two space booster variants:
North Korea test-fired a short-range missile off its eastern coast toward Japan on 1 May 2005. The missile, fired into the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), appeared to have a range of between 100 to 120 kilometers. It is called by the North the KN-02 Toksa ("Viper"), an upgraded version of the Russian SS-21, with a longer range. The KN-02 nomenclature was disclosed by Kim Sung-il Kim Seong-il, chief information officer at Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a closed-door parliamentary session. The DPRK test-fired the same type of missile in April 2004, but the test failed. Another multiple test has taken place in 2006, and it was a success. According to most reports, the missile was deployed in 2007, and was seen on military parades.
Warheads.
North Korean missiles can serve to deliver various types of warheads, including WMD. It is possible that up to three Rodong-1 missiles are fitted with nuclear warheads. In a similar manner to the initial Chinese nuclear doctrine, nuclear weapons are being stored separately, and would only be mounted on missiles after an order of the supreme commander (Kim Jong-un). Despite the claims by numerous media that North Korea has not yet created nuclear warheads small enough to be fit in a missile, reports surfaced in April 2009, according to which North Korea has miniaturized warheads, capable of being mounted on its missiles. The most suitable nuclear weapons delivery system is the Rodong-1, which has been successfully tested many times.
Additionally, the DPRK possesses a large chemical weapons stockpile, including powerful agents such as tabun, sarin, soman, VX gas and others. Little is known about the biological weapons stockpiles. They are probably limited, as North Koreans consider them much more dangerous to handle, therefore posing a threat to their own soldiers apart from the enemy.
North Korea has yet to demonstrate the ability to produce a re-entry vehicle, without which North Korea cannot deliver a weapon from an ICBM.
Doubts about the missiles.
United Nations and independent experts say that North Korea does not operate missiles beyond the intermediate range, and that the long-range missiles shown at parades are mock-ups. There are doubts about the authenticity of the KN-08 missiles displayed on 16-wheel carrier trucks during a 2012 military parade, and Musudan missiles shown in 2010 were probably mock-ups.
The experts who studied the most doubted KN-08 pictures have pointed out multiple problems. For example:
Exports.
Several countries, including Pakistan and Libya, have bought North Korean ballistic missiles or received assistance from North Korea to establish local missile production.

Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council, 1890–1894

This is a list of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council from December 1890 until July 1894. 
Prior to the passage of the "Constitution Act 1889", Western Australia had a partly elected and partly nominated Legislative Council. The Act created a fully elective Western Australian Legislative Assembly as a separate house, and a 15-seat Council whose members were nominated by the Governor of Western Australia. It was anticipated by Part III of the Constitution that the Council would remain purely nominative until the colony had reached a population of 60,000—seen as a distant goal with an 1888 population of 43,814 and the levelling off of earlier growth. However, due to the gold rush which saw thousands of people migrate from other Australian colonies and from overseas, the population reached 64,923 by 31 December 1893. The "Constitution Act Amendment Act 1893" was passed to transform the Council into an elective house of 21 members on a restricted franchise, effective from the 1894 elections.

Growing up in Auckland, Manuel was an Otahuhu Leopards junior and in 1997 was selected for the Junior Kiwis.
Rugby league career.
Manuel played for the Warriors for two seasons, winning the Rookie of the Year award in 1999. In 2000 he represented the New Zealand Māori at the World Cup. He then spent two years at Canberra which were much less successful. Mid way through his first season he was injured in a collision with Lesley Vainikolo in training and he spent much of his second year in reserve grade.
He then returned to New Zealand to play for the Hibiscus Coast Raiders in the Bartercard Cup before a swansong season in Australia with the Central Comets. However after only six games he was diagnosed with arthritis and forced to retire.

In March he won the Queensland title at the Queensland Open in Brisbane, lifting 892.5 kg, and in July 2009 he won the Australian national title by lifting 916 kg to break the Australian record by more than 20 kg and claim the overall title.
However Manuel tested positive to methylhexanamine at the Australian Powerlifting National Championships and was disqualified from the powerlifting events he competed in at the 2009 National Championships. He was banned for three months for the use of a banned substance, instead of the usual two-year suspension due to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) being satisfied that he used the substance as part of a supplement and not to boost his performance in the sport.
November 2012 after time off with knee injury Manuel returned to competition mode in melbournes proraw powerlifting event posting a huge 932.5kg raw total made up of a 350kg(squat)215kg(bench)367.5kg(deadlift)@129kg bodyweight.This event made him the first man in australian history to go over 900kg raw in his weight class.

Chapel Row

Chapel Row is a village in Berkshire, and part of the civil parish of Bucklebury, England. The settlement lies near to the A4 road, and is situated approximately north-east of Newbury.
History.
Since the mid 17th century, an inn has stood near to the village green. The site is now occupied by The Bladebone Inn.
In the 18th century, Chapel Row became known for its revels, which were held on the Monday following the feast of Saint Anne. The revels featured events such as backswording (described by Joseph Addison in "The Spectator" as "a ring of cudgel players who broke one another's heads in order to make some impression on their mistresses' hearts"). The sport was not featured in a number of later fayres as at least one contender was reported to have been killed. An 1812 "Reading Mercury" article on the fayre focuses primarily on agriculture, stating that the event was an opportunity to trade cattle and employ farmhands.
Notable people.
Chapel Row was the home of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge before her marriage in April 2011.

Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways

The Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways ("Großherzoglich Hessischen Staatseisenbahnen") belonged to the "Länderbahnen" at the time of the German Empire. In the 19th century, the Grand Duchy of Hesse consisted of three provinces. Between the rivers Rhine, Main and Neckar the province of Starkenburg embraced the Odenwald and the Hessian Ried. It also included the ducal residence of Darmstadt. West of the Rhine, was the province of Rhenish Hesse ("Rheinhessen") with the towns of Mainz, Worms and Bingen. The province of Upper Hesse ("Oberhessen"), which included the Vogelsberg and the Wetterau was not directly linked by land to the others.
As a result of its lack of territorial integrity, the state did not initially build its own state railway. Rather it took part in joint state railway projects with its neighbouring states:
These were the:
As for the rest, a large number of projects by the private Hessian Ludwig Railway Company was encouraged.
Not until 1876 did the Grand Duchy of Hesse found its own state railway. Its basis was the acquisition of the Upper Hessian Railway Company.
This opened and operated the Vogelsberg and Lahn-Kinzig lines from Giessen between 1869 and 1871. In 1880, of a total of of route, lay in Hessen-Darmstadt and in Prussia.
After its transition into state ownership, the network was expanded in accordance with a statute of 29 May 1884, by three branch lines, that fed into the Giessen - Gelnhausen line in the Vogelsberg region:
A further state branch line between Eberstadt and Pfungstadt was opened on 20 December 1886. It was only long and was operated by the "Main-Neckar Railway", but had its own staff, locomotives and coaches.
In 1897 the Hessian State Railways were merged into the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company.

Sheffield Medical School

The School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Sheffield is a medical school active in three fields of medicine: teaching, researching and practising. 
The medical school was founded in 1828. The school operated independently as the Sheffield School of Medicine until its mergers with Firth College in 1879 and with Sheffield Technical School in 1884. In 1897 the schools were renamed University College Sheffield. 
The University of Sheffield Medical School is one of 32 bodies entitled by the General Medical Council (GMC) to award medical degrees in the United Kingdom. The GMC is the body responsible for registering doctors to practise medicine as well as regulating medical education and training in the United Kingdom.
Applying for a place to study Medicine at Sheffield is competitive. As of 2013 the medical school admits some 214 home students and a further 23 overseas students per year.
For entry in 2013 the school received over 3,000 applications.
Research.
The school's research focuses in seven areas, cardiovascular science; endocrinology and reproduction; infection, inflammation and immunity; musculoskeletal science; neuroscience; oncology; and primary care and ageing. The school has been associated with a number of notable medical discoveries. In the 1920s, Edward Mellanby's studies on rickets established that cod liver oil prevented the disease, which helped lead to its eradication. In the 1930s, Cecil Payne became the first to use Penicillin to effect a cure. Also in the 1930s, Sir Hans Krebs made significant advancements in the study of cellular energy, codifying his observations in the Krebs Cycle, for which work he received a Nobel Prize in 1953.

Benny Giay

Benny Giay (born 12 January 1955, in the village Onago, Waketei district, in what was then Netherlands New Guinea) is a theologian, a social anthropologist, and an activist, known for his activities in reconciliation to protect the rights of the Papuans of the Western, Indonesian controlled, part of New Guinea.
Early life and education.
Giay attended Junior High School in Tiom (Paniai) from 1960 to 1967. In 1971 he went to a teacher training school also in Tiom. He started his studies in social work at the Cenderawasih University (UNCEN) in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia in 1974. From 1980 to 1983 he studied for a Master of Divinity degree at the Asian Theological Seminary, in Manila, the Philippines. He was ordained as a pastor in the Kemah Injil Church (KINGMI) (Gospel Tabernacle Church), which was founded by the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 1983 he was appointed lecturer at the Jaffray Theological College in Makassar, South Sulawesi and for three years he also taught courses for pastors in Kalimantan. In 1987 Giay returned to Papua to work as a pastor. He took the initiative of establishing the Walter Post Theological College there, so that students would not have to go all the way to Makassar if they wanted to study for the ministry. From 1990 to 1995 he did his doctoral studies in social anthropology at the Free University in Amsterdam. He did field work in Paniai, Papua from June 1991 to March 1992. He graduated in 1995 with a thesis on the Wege Bage, a new religious movement led by Zakheus Pakage in his home district of Paniai.
Academic work.
The research of Benny Giay is focused on the role of religion and the Christian faith in Papuan society. He did research on new religious movements, in particular on cargo cults in the Papuan context. This term can be considered derogatory, as it assumes that Papuans are primitive people who have an unrealistic and irrational way to acquire material goods; it also assumes that their religious feelings and expressions can be reduced to this attitude. Giay describes these new movements with sympathy and often from an insider's perspective. His doctoral thesis was a study of the Wege Bage Movement in his home regency (Paniai), a movement that had been initiated by Zakheus Pakage. Several of Giay's relatives had joined the movement. Giay sees the movement as a legitimate way to reconcile traditional culture and Christianity, though as a member of the evangelical KINGMI Papua Church, he is also critical of it. Giay calls on followers of the Wege Bage Movement not to close themselves off from a discussion on the Christian truth with other churches, and he also appeals to his own church not to condemn the movement, but to initiate a dialogue.
In later publications Giay advocates a church that is active in the human rights movement, and which is a spokesperson for Papuans, who are victims of repression by the Indonesian security forces. He advocates a theology that is inspired by liberation theologians and by Frantz Fanon. He pleads for the recognition of the right of Papuans to their own cultural and ethnic identity. Papuans, in his view, are Melanesians, with a black skin and frizzy hair, and they can never become Indonesians with amber-coloured skin and straight hair. He wrote an article on the origins of the Papuan political movement called Papua Zone Damai and Papua Tanah Damai — the Papua Peace Zone and the Papua Land of Peace project. This a non-violent spiritual movement of Papuans fighting for their rights. It is supported by churches and by several NGOs. 
At the Second Papua Congress of May–June 2000, the Papua Council (Dewan Papua) gave Giay the task of initiating a debate on rectifying Papuan history "(meluruskan sejarah)". The purpose of the project is to give Papuans their own history back, to demand recognition for Papuan heroes and to honour the many Papuan victims of Indonesian repression since 1962. In the context of this project he has written several studies, like the biographies of Theys Eluay and of Rev Saud. He also wrote a local church history of the Nduga Regency of Papua (see also list of publications below).
The Papuan Struggle.
On returning to Papua in 1995 after his studies in the Netherlands, Giay became a lecturer in Church and Society and Contextual Theology at the Walter Post Theological College where he established a Postgraduate Program Church and Society. He has also been active in the Papua movement. In July 1998, he took the initiative to establish the Forum for the Reconciliation of Irian Jaya Society (FORERI). It aimed at a discussion on ways in which Papuans could have "an opportunity to handle their own affairs" whether through full independence, through wide-ranging autonomy within the Indonesian unitary state, or through the formation of a federal system in which the province of Irian Jaya (now the provinces of Papua and West-Papua) would enjoy substantial autonomy. FORERI helped to set up the national dialogue in Papua, initiated by President B. J. Habibie. This resulted in 100 Papuans, representing the various districts, unanimously demanding independence from Habibie in February 1999. 
Benny Giay was elected by the Second Papua Congress in Jayapura in June 2000 to be a member of the Presidium of the Papua Council (Presidium Dewan Papua or PDP). This Congress, with representatives from all the regions of West Papua, debated the political future of Papua. He was charged with the "straightening of Papua history"("meluruskan sejarah Papua"). To help the discussion he published a pamphlet "Towards a New Papua", providing resource material to help Papuans discuss their future. He also later supported the initiative to turn the Papua struggle into a peaceful, non-violent struggle with the establishment of Zones of Peace and Papua as a Land of Peace ("Tanah Damai").
In July 2002 the local organisation for the defence of human rights ELSHAM, the churches and the PDP set up a Peace Task force, with Benny Giay as its head. Its primary objective is to pursue reconciliation among Papuans through peaceful dialogue.
Giay's book "Peristiwa penculikan dan pembunuhan Theys H Eluay 10 November 2001" (The Abduction and Assassination of Theys H Eluay on November 10, 2001)" was banned by the local authorities in West Papua. The book was considered dangerous to national unity.
At the Synod Conference of the Gereja Kemah Injil (KINGMI) Papua Church in 2010 Benny Giay was elected chairman of the Synod. In December 2011 he was in that capacity a member of a team of four Papuan church leaders that met President Susilo Bandang Yudhoyono to argue in favor of a dialogue between the Indonesian Government and the Papua people in the presence of a neutral observer.
Honours.
In 2003 Benny Giay received the Tanenbaum Peace Makers Award.

Charles Fawcus

Charles Leslie Dinsdale Fawcus (8 December 1898—8 December 1967) was an English cricketer who played seven first-class matches in the 1920s. Despite his short career, he made first-class appearances for Kent, Worcestershire and Oxford University; he also turned out for Dorset at minor counties level.
After a couple of appearances for Kent's Second XI Fawcus made his first-team debut for that county against Middlesex in June 1924; he batted at eight in the first innings and two in the second, making 0 and 5.
This was to prove his only first-class appearance for Kent, but in 1925 and 1926 he played for Oxford on five occasions. It was in one of these matches, against Surrey in June 1926, that he made his only first-class half-century, striking 70 in the second innings. He was a student at Christ Church, Oxford.
As well as these appearances "for" Oxford, on one occasion Fawcus played "against" them. This happened at The Parks in May 1925, when he turned out for Worcestershire; he made 43 and 4.
He played no first-class cricket after the 1926 season, but played for Dorset at minor-counties level in the 1930s. Fawcus bowled regularly for Dorset, despite never having taken a wicket at first-class level, and in August 1933 against Cornwall claimed a first-innings return of 7-68.
Fawcus died on his 69th birthday. The announcement in "The Times" of his son's marriage in 1967 indicates that Fawcus was commonly called by his second name, Leslie.

Best of KAT-TUN

"Best of KAT-TUN" is the debut album by Japanese boy band KAT-TUN, released in Japan on March 22, 2006 by J-One Records. Despite the title, it is not a greatest hits compilation album. Seven songs on the record, however, were part of KAT-TUN's live tour set list prior to their debut and were already familiar with longtime fans.
The album was part of a tripartite release also consisting of the group's debut single and its tie-in DVD. All three releases were immensely successful on the Oricon albums, singles and DVD charts with "Real Face" and "Real Face Film" being certified as the best-selling single and domestic music DVD of the year respectively. The album itself was the eleventh best-selling album of the year.
Album information.
Most of the songs on the album were written for KAT-TUN either by in-house Johnny's Entertainment songwriters or lyricists with a track record of successful hit records for other artists. KAT-TUN members, with the exception of Junnosuke Taguchi, co-wrote 3 songs for the album which were sung as duets. All rap lyrics were also written by Koki Tanaka himself.
Chart performance and reception.
In its first week of release, "Best of KAT-TUN" sold 556,548 copies in Japan, the highest first-week sales for the group to date. The album actually debuted at number 1 on the Oricon daily album charts the day before its release since its official release date fell on a national holiday.

Hans Wärmling

Hans Wärmling (22 July 1943–12 October 1995) was a Swedish musician and songwriter, and was a founding member and keyboardist of the British rock band, The Stranglers. His most notable achievement was as co-writer of the 1982 UK Top 40 release "Strange Little Girl". He drowned in a boating accident in 1995.
Early years.
The Jackie Fountains.
Little is known of Hans Wärmling's childhood or teenage years. It is known that he was the guitar player in a rhythm and blues band called "The Jackie Fountains" that formed in 1964 and played in the Gnesta area of Sweden until 1967. His brother, Peter Wärmling, became their manager and provided rehearsal facilities. In this band he was known by the nickname of 'Hasse'.
Johnny Sox.
In 1972 a young Hugh Cornwell had travelled to Lund in Sweden and took up a position in the local university hospital whilst studying for a PhD in biochemistry. Cornwell became friends with Hans Wärmling who happened to be working at the same hospital as a nurse.
Wärmling suggested that Hugh Cornwell could provide English lyrics to some of the 500 songs that he had recorded on a reel to reel tape recorder and they quickly became close friends. Other musicians (Jan Knutsson, Gyrth Godwin and 'Chicago Mike') were recruited to form the band 'Johnny Sox'. In 1973 Cornwell decided to end his academic studies in Sweden and moved back to London, persuading the other members of 'Johnny Sox' to move with him although Wärmling chose to remain in his home country.
'Johnny Sox' continued to play in London pubs and clubs until mid-1974 with Jet Black joining the band to replace the original drummer 'Chicago Mike'. Jean-Jacques Burnel had also joined the band line-up after being given a lift by Gyrth Godwin. Relations within the band deteriorated and both Godwin and Knutsson decided to return to Sweden. Cornwell convinced both Black and Burnel that they needed Hans Wärmling to fill the gap who, once contacted, came to London immediately.
The Stranglers.
With the line-up of Black, Burnel, Cornwell and Wärmling the band renamed themselves 'The Guildford Stranglers' and began playing gigs again in pubs and clubs, mainly playing cover versions of MOR pop tunes. Wärmling was far from happy with this musical direction; in particular, he objected to having to learn and play "Tie a Yellow Ribbon" and he suddenly left the band in 1975, leaving the bus while they were travelling to a gig at a bar mitzvah in North London. Wärmling and Cornwell did not meet again until 1994.
His position as keyboard player was soon filled by Dave Greenfield who had answered an advert placed in the Melody Maker newspaper.
Song writing credits and discography.
Hans Wärmling is co-credited with writing the music for three early (1974) Stranglers tracks: "Wasted", "My Young Dreams", and "Strange Little Girl". These tracks with Wärmling playing keyboards can be heard on the compilation album "The Early Years '74 '75 '76 Rare Live and Unreleased". Most notably "Strange Little Girl", re-released with revised lyrics and Greenfield on keyboards reached number seven in the UK Top 40 in 1982. "Strange Little Girl" was later released as a cover version by Tori Amos.
Death.
Hans Wärmling died in a boating accident near Gothenburg in 1995.

Éclaireurs of the Guard

The Éclaireurs of the Guard () was a Corps of cavalry scouts of the French Imperial Guard, which included three cavalry regiments created by Napoleon when he reorganised the Imperial Guard following the disaster of the 1812 campaign in Russia. The Corps was created in Article I of the decree of 4 December 1813.
The 1st regiment was divided into the Old Guard and Young Guard squadrons, with the first two wearing a uniform of the hussars, also sometimes known as Hussards Éclaireurs, and the others wearing a coatee similar to the Chasseurs a Cheval.
All three regiments were organised into four squadrons with 250 sabres in two companies each. Due to insufficient recruits, an appeal was made for volunteers from the Cavalry of the Line, and 1,005 troopers eventually were added to the regimental rolls. Although half of the Éclaireurs were armed with 2.75m long lances issued in 1812 to the line regiments, and the rest with carbines, the regiments were rarely employed as lancers in battle, more usually acting as scouts for the Army as a whole. The lances had crimson over white pennons although none were initially intended for issue, and many troopers were lacking these also. The rest of the weapons equipping the Éclaireurs were the standard Chasseur a Cheval model Year XIII cavalry pistols and model Year IX light cavalry sabre. Due to general lack of equipment only the 3rd regiment was able to obtain shabraques, with only officers being so equipped in the 1st and 2nd regiments.
The regiments, owing to their scouting role, were not issued Eagles.
1st Regiment of Éclaireurs.
The 1st Regiment of which was attached to the Horse Grenadiers, and was thus sometimes called the regiment of Éclaireurs-grenadiers, as counterparts to the Cossacks. They arrived in the theatre of operations late in the Napoleonic Wars, joining the army on 1 January 1814 just in time to participate in the Six Days Campaign (fighting at Brienne, La Rothière, Champaubert, Montmirail, Montereau, Craonne and Arcis-sur-Aube) then to be dissolved on the Bourbon Restoration.
The 1st Regiment's first commander was Claude Testot-Ferry, transferred from his command of the Empress' Dragoons, and most of the Regiment's officers were directly recruited from within the Guard including a large number from the Gardes d'Honneur, including Pierre (an old soldier from Testot-Ferry's old regiment of the 10e régiment de chasseurs à cheval), Delavillane, Lepot (from the Guard's mounted grenadiers) and Kister. The first of these squadrons had uniforms largely in the Hussar style, based on those of the Gardes d'Honneur (a green dolman and a pelisse with white lace and black fur for officers), and were attached to the Old Guard. The other 3 squadrons were uniformed in the style of Chasseurs de la Ligne (a short dark green habit-veste, also known as a "Kinski") and attached to the Young Guard. The jackets of trumpeters were sky-blue.
The first detachment of the regiment left for the field army in late January 1814, but by mid March the entire regiment was reduced to 200 sabres. The regiment was eventually renamed as the 2nd Regiment of Chasseurs a Cheval of the Guard in 1815.

2nd Regiment of Éclaireurs.
The second regiment was attached to the Dragoons of the Guard, and because of this also referred to as Éclaireurs-Dragons, had scarlet regimental distinctions. For its formation the regiment was allocated officers and NCOs from the 20th Dragons of Line, 3rd and 7th Lancers of the Line while the troopers came from postilions of the Empire, the horse team drivers employed by the Government. The horses were primarily purchased from the Camarguais regional breed, and the remount depot was established there. The regiment participated in the French Campaign of 1814, including Battle of Brienne, Battle of Champaubert, Battle of Montmirail, Battle of Château-Thierry, Battle of Vauchamps, Battle of Montereau, Battle of Rheims, Battle of Craonne, Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube and Battle of Saint-Dizier.
Unlike the first regiment, the second was distinguished by the shako which all the modern works indicate to have been cylindrical, and was decorated by a surmounted rosette of a ganse cord and of a half-spherical pompom. The cord was tied in front of and behind the neck for the officers, the troopers carrying it in the usual way. The shako issued to the regiment is therefore same as that worn by the hussars at the time. The spherical pompom was the colour of the squadron.
3rd Regiment of Éclaireurs.
The third regiment was recruited from Polish cavalry line regiments serving with the French Army, and was attached to the 1st Lancers of the Guard, also a Polish regiment.
In 1814 all three regiments were transferred to the line cavalry, and disbanded following Napoleon's abdication.

Indo-Canadians

Indo-Canadians are Canadians from Indian descent or heritage. The terms "East Indian" and "South Asian" are used to distinguish people of ancestral origin from India, from the First Nations peoples of Canada who are often referred to as Indian, and from the people of the Caribbean, who are sometimes referred to as West Indian.
Most Canadians of Indian origin prefer, and many times will refer to themselves as, "Indian", rather than "East Indian". This is partially because historically the Americas were mistaken by Columbus as India and native Americans were mistaken by Columbus for Indians and later as West Indians. It is also seen to be a reflection of India's size and stature, as well as its cultural, economic and political position in the world.
However, because the term East Indian is not blatantly pejorative and persists in being widely used by other Canadians, this term is also somewhat acceptable and tolerated by most Indo-Canadians. The term "East Indian" is relatively unknown in India. Another term, NRI (non-resident Indian), is used by Indians in India to refer to Indians abroad, including Canada. The main concentration of the Indo-Canadian population is found in the Metro Vancouver/Fraser Valley Region and the Greater Toronto Area, however there are growing communities in Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, and Montreal.
History.
There may have been encounters between South Asians and Native Americans in the sixteenth century along the Atlantic coast of present day Canada. Evidence from further south in the United States suggests that South Asian slaves were among the first settlers at Jamestown, Virginia. Lascars aboard Portuguese, Spanish and possibly French ships may have also arrived on the coasts of Labrador and Nova Scotia.
The first definitive encounters between the First Nations and other aboriginal peoples of present day Canada and South Asia, began in the eighteenth century, when British traders engaged in the Fur Trade arrived along the Pacific coast of Northwest America. These encounters involved the arrival of Lascars on ships from Bombay, Calcutta and Macau.
Reasons for moving.
The Indo-Canadian community started around the beginning of the 20th century. The pioneers were men, mostly Sikhs from the Punjab; many were veterans of the British Army. In 1897 a contingent of Sikh soldiers participated in the parade to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in London, England. On their subsequent journey home, they visited the western coast of Canada, primarily British Columbia which at the time was very sparsely populated and the Canadian government wanted to settle in order to prevent a takeover of the territory by the United States
Upon retiring from the army, some of these men found their pensions to be inadequate, it was dangerous in India or else their lands were in the clutches of money-lenders. They decided to try their fortunes in the countries they had visited. They joined an Indian diaspora, which included people from Burma through Malaysia, the East Indies, the Philippines, and China. They were able to get work in the police force and some were employed as night-watchmen by British firms. Others started small businesses of their own or drove taxis. These were modest beginnings but they had bigger ideas. The Sikhs, who had seen Canada, recommended the "New World" to fellow Sikh people who were in a position to venture out and seek new fortunes. They were guaranteed jobs by agents of big Canadian companies like the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Hudson's Bay Company. Overcoming their initial reluctance to go to these countries due to the treatment of Asians by the white population, many young men chose to go, having been assured that they would not meet the same fate. They were British subjects; Canada was a part of the British Empire; and the British Empire owed much to the Sikhs. Queen Victoria had proclaimed in 1858 that throughout the empire the people of India that they would enjoy "equal privileges with white people without discrimination of colour, creed or race." 
Initial settlement.
However, upon arrival to British Columbia, the first Sikh immigrants faced widespread racism by the local white Canadians. Most of the white Canadians feared workers who would work for less pay, and that an influx of more immigrants would threaten their jobs. As a result there were a series of race riots that targeted the Sikh immigrants, who were beat up by mobs of angry white Canadians. These mobs not only targeted Indians, but also other Asian group such as the Chinese immigrants working on the railroad at the time and Black Canadians. From the social pressure most decided to return to India, while a few stayed behind. To support the white Canadian population on the west coast of Canada, who did not want Indians to immigrate to Canada, the Canadian government prevented Indian men from bringing their wives and children until 1919, which was another considerable factor in their decision to leave Canada.
The restrictions by the Canadian government increased on Indians, and policies were put in place in 1907 to prevent Indians who had the right to vote from voting in future general elections. Furthermore, government quotas were established to cap the number of Indians allowed to immigrate to Canada in the early 20th century. This was part of a policy adopted by Canada to ensure that the country retained its primarily European demographic, and was similar to American and Australian immigration policies at the time. These quotas only allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when it was marginally increased (to 300 people a year). In comparison to the quotas established for Indians, people from Europe immigrated freely without quotas in large numbers during that time to Canada, numbering in the tens of thousands yearly.
In 1914, the Komagata Maru a steam liner carrying 376 passengers from Punjab, India (all were British subjects) arrived in Vancouver. Most of the passengers were not allowed to land in Canada and were returned to India. When the Kamagata Maru returned to Calcutta (now Kolkata), they were fired upon by the British, many died. Viewing this as evidence that Indians were not treated as equals under the British Empire, they staged a peaceful protest upon returning to India. British forces saw this as a threat to their authority, and opened fire on the protestors, killing many. This was one of the most notorious "incidents" in the history of exclusion laws in Canada designed to keep out immigrants of Asian origin.
Recent settlement.
Policies changed rapidly during the second half of the 20th century.
In 1906 and 1907 there was a spike in migration from the Indian sub-continent into British Columbia. Most of the migrants were Punjabi Sikhs though there were Hindus and Muslims too. an estimated 4700 arrived, at around the same time as a rise in Chinese and Japanese immigration. The federal government curtailed the migration and over the next seven years, fewer the 125 South Asians were permitted to land in British Columbia. Those who had arrived were often single men and many returned to South Asia, others sought opportunities south of the border in the USA. It is estimated that the number of South Asians in British Columbia fell to less than 2000 by 1914.
The Canadian government re-enfranchised the Indo-Canadian community with the right to vote in 1947.
When British India was partitioned into India and Pakistan (East and West) upon independence in 1947. Thousands of people were moved across the new borders. Research in Canada suggests that many of the early Goans to emigrate to Canada were those who were born and lived in Karachi, Bombay and Calcutta. At the time Goa was under Portuguese rule and faced an uncertain future. Goans as Christians were very much tied to British administration and saw little opportunity in Hindu-dominated India or Muslim-dominated Pakistan.
Another group of people that arrived in Canada at this time were the Anglo-Indians, actually people of mixed European and South Indian stock.
In 1967 all immigration quotas based on specific ethnic groups were scrapped in Canada. The social view in Canada towards people of other ethnic backgrounds was more open, and Canada was facing declining immigration from European countries, since these European countries had booming postwar economies, and thus more people decided to remain in their home countries. Canada introduced an immigration policy that was based on a point system, with each applicant being assessed on their trade skills and the need for these skills in Canada. This allowed many more Indians to immigrate in large numbers and a trickle of East African Goans (who were English-speaking and Catholic) started to arrive after East African countries imposed Africanization policies. In the 1970s, thousands of immigrants came yearly and mainly settled in Vancouver and Toronto.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, tens of thousands of immigrants continued to move from India into Canada. According to Statistics Canada, since the late 1990s roughly 25,000-30,000 Indians arrive each year (which is now the second-most populous cultural group immigrating to Canada each year, behind Chinese immigrants who are the largest group). The settlement pattern in the last two decades is still mainly focused around Vancouver, but other cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, and Montreal have also become desirable due to growing economic prospects in these cities.
Indians from other countries.
In addition to tracing their origin directly to the Indian subcontinent, many Indo-Canadians who arrive in Canada come from other parts of the world, as part of the global Indian diaspora.
Indians from Africa.
Due to political turmoil and prejudice, many Indians residing in East African nations, such as Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, left the region for Canada and other Western countries. A majority of Indo-Canadians from East Africa are Ismaili Muslims. M.G. Vassanji, an award-winning novelist who writes on the plight of Indians in East Africa, is a naturalized Canadian of Indian descent who migrated from East Africa. The writer Ladis Da Silva (1920-1994) was a Zanzibar-born Canadian of Goan descent who wrote The Americanization of Goans. He emigrated in 1968 from Kenya and was a prolific writer and social reformer, working with First Nations, Inuit and Senior Citizens in the Greater Toronto Area.
Indians have also moved to Canada from Southern African nations such as Zambia, Malawi and South Africa for similar reasons, and examples of successful Indo-Canadians from this migratory stream are Suhana Meharchand and Nirmala Naidoo, television newscasters of Indian descent from South Africa, who currently work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Indira Naidoo-Harris is also another Canadian broadcaster who is of Indian descent from South Africa.
Two of the most high profile Indo-Africans are CNN's Zain Verjee and Ali Velshi. Verjee was educated in Canada while Velshi's father Murad Velshi who immigrated from South Africa was the first MPP of Indian descent to sit in the Ontario legislature.
The most notable story of Indo-African immigration to Canada is set in the 1970s, when in 1972 50,000 Indian Ugandans were forced out of Uganda by the dictator Idi Amin, and were not permitted to return to India by the Indian government. Although on the brink of facing torture and imprisonment on a massive scale, the Aga Khan IV, leader of the Nizari Ismaili Community, specially negotiated his followers' safe departure from Uganda in exchange for all their belongings. He also negotiated their guaranteed asylum in Canada with Prime Minister and close friend Pierre Elliott Trudeau. A notable descendent of Ugandian Indian settlement in Canada is Irshad Manji, an acclaimed advocate for secularism and reform in Islam. The community of Goans, is also mainly from East Africa.
Indians from the Caribbean.
Indo-Caribbean people or Indo-Caribbeans are Caribbean people with roots in India.
The Indo-Caribbean community has developed a unique cultural blend of both Indian, Western and "Creolised Caribbean" culture due to a long period of isolation from India, amongst other reasons. Some Indo-Caribbean Canadians associate themselves with the Indo-Canadian community. However, most associate with the Indo-Caribbean community, or the Wider Caribbean community, or with both. They mainly live within the Greater Toronto Area. The vast majority do not subscribe to the term South Asian and are opposed to being classified as such and in their daily lives, describe themselves as "Indians."
Indians from the UK and the United States.
Some Indians have immigrated from the UK and the United States due to both economic and family reasons. Indians move for economic prospects to Canada's economy and job market and have been performing well against many European and some American states. Lastly, individuals have decided to settle in Canada in order to reunite their family who may have settled in both the United States and UK and not in Canada.
Indians from the Middle East.
Many Indians have been moving from countries in the Middle East to North America.
Most Indian immigrants from the Middle East are Indian businessmen and professionals that worked in the Middle Eastern countries like the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. A key priority for these immigrants is educational opportunities for their children post schooling. Many of these students have stayed back after graduation and started their families there. The vast majority of Indo-Canadians from the Middle East are of Malayali ethnicity.
Indians from Oceania.
Indians have long been settled in certain parts of Oceania, mainly on the island of Fiji, where they comprise approximately 50% of the island's population. Since Fiji's independence, increased hostility between the native Fijian population and the Indo-Fijian population has led to several significant confrontations politically. Therefore, some Indo-Fijians are moving from the island to USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand due to political instability and ethnic conflict.
Indo-Canadian demographics.
Population settlement.
The Indo-Canadian population according to the National Household Survey in the 2011 in the 10 Canadian Provinces and 3 territories:
Cities with large Indian populations:
Canadian metropolitan areas with large Chinese populations:
As of 2009, the Indo-Canadian population has passed the 1 million mark.
Toronto.
Toronto has the largest Indian Community in Canada. Almost 51% of the entire Indo-Canadian community resides in the Greater Toronto Area. Most Indians in the Toronto area live in Brampton, Gerrard Street, Rexdale, Scarborough, and Mississauga. Indo Canadians have a particularly strong presence in Brampton, where they represent a third of the Populations, almost the entire population in the North-Eastern portion of the city. Indian carrier Jet Airways operates daily flights from Toronto Pearson International Airport to India. The Indians are mostly of Punjabi, Malayalee, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil and Goan origin. Three bona fide Little India enclaves have been evolved around the Greater Toronto Area.
Vancouver.
Around 20% of the entire Indian Community in Canada resides in the Vancouver area. Settlement by Indians has occurred increasingly since the point system was introduced to allow immigrants into Canada.
The highest density concentrations of Indo-Canadians are found in Vancouver, Surrey, Burnaby, Richmond, Abbotsford and Delta. Recently, more Indians have been moving to other areas outside of Metro Vancouver. The city of Surrey has over 107,000 South Asians, comprising almost one-third of the city's population. The Punjabi Market neighborhood of South Vancouver also has a particularly high concentration of Indian residents, shops and restaurants.
A large majority of Indo-Canadians within Vancouver are of Punjabi Sikh origin. However, there are also populations with other ethnic backgrounds including Gujarati, Tamil, Malayalees, Bengali, Urdu, Goan Christian and Sindhi.
Calgary.
5% of the Indo-Canadian Community resides in Calgary. Calgary has one of the fastest growing Indian Communities in Canada. Indians are the second-largest minority in Calgary after the Chinese.
Religion.
Indo-Canadians are from very diverse religious backgrounds compared to many other ethnic groups, which is due in part to India's multi-religious population. Unlike in India however, representation of various minority religious groups is much higher amongst the Indo-Canadian population. For instance in India, Sikhs comprise 2% and Christians 2.2% of the population of India, Hindus 80-82% and Muslims 13.4%. Amongst the Indo-Canadian population however, the religious views are more evenly divided. In 2001, Sikhs represented 35%, Hindus 28%, Muslims 17% and Christians 16% (7% Protestant/Evangelical, 9% Catholic). Relatively few people of Indian origin have no religious affiliation. In 2001, just 4% said they had no religious affiliation, compared with 17% of the Canadian population.
Places of worship.
Indians have been building places of worship for their respective faiths since the first settlers arrived to Canada. There are well over 175 Sikh societies/Gurdwaras in Canada alone. Hindu temples are usually established by separate Indian ethnic communities and while in a large number, are not as quantitative as Sikh gurdwaras. For instance, there are separate temples for North and South Indians, due to different customs and languages spoken. There are also many Islamic societies and mosques throughout Canada, which have been established and supported by Non-Indian and Indian Muslims alike. Indian Christians tend to attend churches based on their state of origin and their particular traditions including the Church of North India, Church of South India, Mar Thoma Syrian Church, Syrian Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic and Indian Pentecostal Church.
The first Sikh Gurdwara of North America was built in 1911 and is the Gur Sikh Temple of Abbotsford, BC, though debates show evidence to a gudwara having had been built earlier in 1908 and shut down later that decade. The Khalsa Diwan Society is responsible for most of the Gurdwara's in Canada as well as the Gur Sikh Temple. In Mississauga, another renowned Sikh Gurdwara exists, known as the Dixie Gurdwara and has played host to several Sikh martyrs. The Dixie Gurdwara is a fairly large complex compared to most Gurdwara, it contains a sports ground in its property which hosts kabadi matches and tournaments. Another large Gurdwara located in the Toronto area is the Sri Guru Singh Sabha which is connected to Englands Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha as its Canadian Branch. The Gurdwara hosts its own television program in which seniors across the country with no access to religion can listen to hymns.
Within Brampton, the largest Hindu temple in Canada is located on Claireville Drive, which is called the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto. The entire Mandir is and hosts numerous events on the Hindu religious calendar.
In Mississaugs, Ontario www.ydscanada.org Hindu Swaminarayan and Cultural Center Inspired by PP Hariprasad Swamiji Maharaj located at 6875 Professional Court,Mississauga, Ontario, L4V 1Y3. Temple celebrates all Indian fetivals and Youth committee of the templ involved in Youth activities, Networking for New immigrants, Career and Health support and Support to New Immigrant.
Many Indian Muslims along with Muslims of other nationalities worship at one of the largest mosques in Canada, the ISNA Centre, located in Mississauga. The facility contains a mosque, high school, community centre, banquet hall and funeral service available for all Muslim Canadians.
The Ismailis have the first Ismaili Jamatkhana and Centre set up in Burnaby, British Columbia. This high profile building is the 2nd in the World, with other locations in London, Lisbon, and Dubai. A second such building is being built in Toronto.
The majority of people of Goan origin in Canada are Roman Catholics who share the same parish churches as other Catholic Canadians, however they often celebrate the feast of St Francis Xavier, who is the Patron Saint of the Indies, and whose body lies in Goa.
Language.
Indo-Canadians speak a variety of languages, reflecting the cultural and ethnic diversity of the Indian subcontinent. The most widely spoken South Asian language is Punjabi, which is spoken by people from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, North parts of Rajasthan or Delhi in India. Some speakers of Punjabi in Canada may also be Pakistani and they come from Punjab Province or Islamabad Capital Territory in Pakistan. The next most widely spoken language spoken by South Asians is Tamil. These individuals hail from the state of Tamil Nadu in India, and speakers in Canada of the Tamil language come from both India and Sri Lanka. Urdu is primarily spoken by Muslim South Asians from North India and Pakistan. Hindi is a language mainly spoken by Indo-Canadians from across North India, however individuals of Indian descent from Africa and the Caribbean may also speak it as well. Gujarati is language spoken exclusively by people from the Indian state of Gujarat. Indians (Ismailis) from East Africa who subsequently migrated to Canada speak Gujarati. Zoroastrians from the western part of India who form a small percentage of the population in Canada, also speak Gujarati. Bengali is spoken by individuals from the state of West Bengal, as well as by the people of Bangladesh, and thus it is not exclusively spoken by Indo-Canadians in Canada, but also by Bangladeshis. There are also a large number of Malayalam language-speakers, who hail from the state of Kerala in South India.There is also a community of English-speaking Goans from East Africa. Few members of this community speak their original language Konkani.
Indo-Canadian culture.
Indo-Canadian culture is closely linked to each specific Indian group's religious and ethnic backgrounds. For instance, Northern Hindus cultural practices differ compared to Hindu Gujaratis and Sikh Punjabis due to either the difference in ethnicity or religion. Such cultural aspects have been preserved fairly well due to Canada's open policy of multiculturalism, as opposed to a policy of assimilation practiced by the United States and the United Kingdom.
The cultures and languages of various Indian communities have been able to thrive in part due to the freedom of these communities to establish structures and institutions for religious worship, social interaction and cultural practices. In particular, Punjabi culture and language have been reinforced in Canada through radio and television.
Alternatively, Indo-Canadian culture has developed its own identity compared to other non-resident Indians and from people in India. It is not uncommon to find youth uninterested with traditional Indian cultural elements and events, instead identifying with mainstream North American cultural mores. However such individuals exist in a minority and there are many youth that maintain a balance between western and eastern cultural values, and occasionally fusing the two to produce a new product, such as the new generation of Bhangra incorporating hip hop based rhythm. For instance, Sikh youth often mix in traditional Bhangra, which uses Punjabi instruments with hip hop beats as well as including rap with Black music entertainers. Notable entertainers include Raghav and Jazzy B.
Marriage.
Arranged and non-arranged marriage
Marriage is an important cultural element amongst many Indo-Canadians, due to their Indian heritage and religious background. Arranged marriage, which is still widely practiced in India, is no longer widely practiced among Canadian-born or naturalized Indians. Since it may be difficult to find someone of the same Indian ethnic background with the desired characteristics, some Indo-Canadians now opt to use online dating services in order to find a marriage partner. Marriage practices amongst Indo-Canadians are more liberal than those of their Indian counterparts, although caste is still considered.
Love-based marriage, where the partners choose themselves rather than their parents arranging the marriage, occurs commonly and is the normal procedure among many East Indian groups. Dating is practiced among many Indo-Canadians, and is as prevalent as other Canadian ethnic groups.
Cross-cultural and interracial marriage
The phenomenon of cross-cultural and interracial marriage has been present in Canada for some years. However, the Indo-Canadian community engages in such marriages to a much lesser extent than members of most other visible minorities. However there is interracial marriage in the second generation. As a result of assimilation, mixed European/White, and Indian backgrounds are becoming more prevalent.
Cross cultural marriages are those that occur between Indo-Canadians and other South Asians which differ in their ethnic background (as in Punjabi or Gujarati), or by religious background. These types of marriages - especially those between different ethnic backgrounds - do occur more often than those between different religions.
Interracial marriages amongst Indo-Canadians mainly occur between a European Canadian and an Indian, and is rarely seen between an Indian and a person of another race such as Black or East Asians. Notable celebrities of biracial (Indian and European background) are Emanuel Sandhu, Manny Malhotra, Lisa Ray and Shaun Majumder.
Television, radio and newspaper.
There are numerous radio programs that represent Indo-Canadian culture. One notable program is Geetmala Radio, hosted by Darshan and Arvinder Sahota (also longtime television hosts of Indo-Canadian program, Eye on Asia).
A number of Canadian television networks broadcast programming that features Indo-Canadian culture. One prominent multicultural/multireligious channel, Vision TV, presents a nonstop marathon of Indo-Canadian shows on Saturdays. These television shows often highlight Indo-Canadian events in Canada, and also show events from India involving Indians who reside there. In addition, other networks such as Omni Television, CityTV and local community access channels also present local Indo-Canadian content, and Indian content from India.
In recent years, there has been an establishment of Indian television networks from India on Canadian television. Shan Chandrasehkhar, an established Indo-Canadian who pioneered one of the first Indo-Canadian television shows in Canada, made a deal with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to allow Indian television networks based in India to send a direct feed to Canada. In doing so, he branded these channels under his own company known as the Asian Television Network. Since 1997, Indo-Canadians can subscribe to channels from India via purchasing TV channel packages from their local satellite/cable companies. Indo-Canadians view such networks as Zee TV, B4U, Sony Entertainment Television, and Aaj Tak to name a few. Goan communities are connected by a number of city-based websites that inform the community of local activities such as dances, religious services and village feasts, that serve to connect the community to its rural origins in Goa.
Radio stations in the Greater Toronto Area with Indo Canadian content include CJSA-FM broadcasting on 101.3FM. Another station is CINA broadcasting on AM 1650.
Major newspapers include Canindia News in Toronto & Montreal, The Asian Star and The Punjabi Star in Vancouver and The South Asian News in Edmonton and Calgary.
Notable Indo-Canadians past and present.
The Indo-Canadian community has had many members involved in the areas of entertainment, academia and most notably politics in Canada. For a full list of notable Indo-Canadians, past and present see the List of Indo-Canadians page.
Films with Indo-Canadian subject matter.
Notably, the largest presence of Bollywood that Canada has seen in the 21st century is an international Bollywood awards show in June 2011. It is the 2011 IIFA Awards being held in the 50,000 seat Rogers Centre in Toronto. Toronto has been chosen as the host city with its large population of 600,000 South Asians. Most actors and actresses in the film industry will be making their way to Toronto for the awards, which are expected to catch a TV audience of over 500 million people from around the globe.

The Dance II

The Dance II by Henri Matisse is a triptych mural (15 ft high by 45 ft long) in the Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia. It was created in 1932 at the request of Albert C. Barnes after he met Matisse in the United States. Barnes was an art enthusiast and long-time collector of Matisse's works, and agreed to pay Matisse a total of $30,000 for the mural, which was expected to take a year.
The mural was to be placed above three arches spanning the windows of the main hall of Barnes' gallery. In Nice, France, Matisse executed the mural on canvas provided by Barnes, as opposed to working on site. This was an unusual approach for such a work, but the patron had offered him complete artistic freedom, and working onsite would in any event have been impractical. 
For Matisse, the project proved to be beset with difficulties, and would end up taking him two years, leaving him physically and emotionally drained. He was also profoundly disappointed to be told on installation that Barnes had no intention of exhibiting the work to the public.
Nevertheless, Matisse was delighted with the work itself. In a 1933 letter to his son, Matisse wrote about the installation at the Barnes Foundation: "It has a splendour that one can't imagine unless one sees it -- because both the whole ceiling and its arched vaults come alive through radiation and the main effect continues right down to the floor...I am profoundly tired but very pleased. When I saw the canvas put in place, it was detached from me and became part of the building."
Some commentators consider that the Dance mural was pivotal in enabling Matisse to return to the most essential sources of his art. For Matisse, the work highlighted aspects such as simplicity, flattening, the emphasis on colour and the use of paper cut-outs which would all go on to play an important role in his later artistic development.
Damage during world tour.
During a 1993 hearing in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Orphan's Court art conservator Paul R. Himmelstein argued that "The Dance II" suffered significant damages during a controversial world tour of highlights from the Barnes Foundation's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings.

HLA-B51

HLA-B51 (B51) is an HLA-B serotype. The serotype identifies the more common HLA-B*51 gene products. 
B51 is a split antigen of the broad antigen B5, and is a sister serotype of B52. There are a large number of alleles within the B*51 allele group. B51 is associated with several diseases, including Behçet's disease.
Alleles.
There are 71 alleles, 57 amino acid sequence variants in B51 of which 4 are nulls. Of these only 9 are frequent enough to have been reliably serotyped. B*5101 is the most common, but others have a large regional abundance.
Disease Associations.
By serotype.
Bw51 was associated with Behçet's disease, in endemic (versus epidemic) mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, susceptibility to the virus that causes German measles infection.
In Behçet's Disease.
Behçet's disease is an inflammation of the wall of blood vessels that can involve the eyes, skin, and the rest of the body. Several alleles of B51 (B*5101, B*5108, B*5105, and B*5104) are found in disease, and linkage to markers, D6S285, in the HLA locus was strong (P>0.005). Homozygotes of B51 showed considerably high risk for disease indicating a possible gene-dose effect. B51 is capable of distinguishing several varieties of disease. HLA-B51 is found more frequently in disease that has an eye involvement. However it is less common in some regions when there is increased neurological involvement. The MICA*009 allele has been found to also associated with ABD when B51 is also present, IL-8 and other cytokines may also be involved. Sister chromatid exchange has also been observed more frequently in B51(+) ABD.
However, B51 tends not to be found in ABD when a certain SUMO4 gene variant is involved, and symptoms appear to be milder when HLA-B27 is present.

Joseph Johann Kauffmann

Joseph Johann Kauffmann (27 February 1707 – 11 January 1782); other first name spellings in references: Josef Johann, Johann Joseph) was an Austrian painter known for his portraits, church decorations and castle depictions. Along with his wife Cleophea Lutz he had a single child, his daughter Angelika Kauffmann (*1741), is also remembered as a painter.
Life.
He was born in Schwarzenberg, Austria, and is described as a relatively poor man with painting skills. The original family home was a small town in the Austrian alps called Schwarzenberg in the Vorarlberg area. In the years 1740 to 1742 he was in duty of the prince-bishop from Chur/Switzerland.
In 1755 the family moved to Milan until in 1757 the mother died and father with daughter returned to Schwarzenberg. There they helped in painting the interiors of the recently heavily fire damaged local church house. The father concentrated on the general interior whilst his daughter worked on the apostle images. At a later time she donated the high altar piece in form of paintings from her own hand.
In the same period the church painting took place the family was traveling the nearby northern lakeside of Lake Constance doing works for the Tettnang seated Montfort counts in form of castle depictions and similar, and going further to Meersburg and even Konstanz.
In 1760 they left for Italy again in order to do studies on classical and Renaissance art there. Whilst the travels they earned money by portraying locals along their path. Up to 1766 they went to Rome with intermediate halts in Milan, Modena, Parma and Florence. On 5 October 1762 the daughter received honorable membership of the "Accademia di Bologna". In 1764 this got topped by joining the "Accademia di San Luca" in Rome on a similar base.
The traveling Englishman and actor David Garrick gave the daughter the chance to portrait her which in turn went into her master piece making her finally famous. On recommendation of Lady Wentworth both moved to London and stayed there starting 1766.
He was the person who taught his daughter painting in the age of 11 that helped her much in her later career all across Europe including England and Italy up to being a foundation member of the Royal Society of Arts. Even in later years some travels along with or for meeting with his daughter have obviously taken place. A strong relation to Italy was further there as he successfully recommended his daughter to marry the venetian painter Antonio Zucchi for her second partner. The marriage took place in Juli 1781. As a result father and the couple travelled south visiting Flandern, Schwarzenberg, Verona and Padua. In October of the same year they arrived in Venice, where Kauffmann died in the following January.

Cutoff voltage

In electronics, the cut-off voltage is the voltage at which a battery is considered fully discharged, and it is good practice to stop discharge at this point. Some electronic devices, such as cell phones, will automatically shut down when the cut-off voltage has been reached.
Batteries.
In batteries,the cut-off (final) voltage is the prescribed lower-limit voltage at which battery discharge is considered complete. The cut-off voltage is usually chosen so that the maximum useful capacity of the battery is achieved. The cut-off voltage is different from one battery to the other and it's highly dependent on the type of battery and the kind of service in which the battery is used. When testing the capacity of a NiMH or NiCd battery a cut-off voltage of 1.0 V is normally used. 0.9V is normally used as the cut-off voltage of an alkaline cell. Devices that have too high cut-off voltages may stop operating while the battery still has significant capacity remaining.
Voltage cut-off in portable electronics.
Some portable equipment does not fully use the low-end voltage spectrum of a battery. The power to the equipment cuts off before a relatively large portion of the battery life has been used.
A high cut-off voltage is more widespread than perhaps assumed. For example, a certain brand of mobile phone that is powered with a single-cell Lithium-ion battery cuts off at 3.3V. The Li‑ion can be discharged to 3V and lower. With a discharge to 3.3V, only about 70% of the capacity is used.
However, particularly in the case of lithium ion batteries which are used in the vast majority of portable electronics today, a voltage cut-off below 3.2V can lead to chemical instability in the cell. The result being a reduced battery lifetime. For this reason, electronics manufacturers tend to use higher cut-off voltages, removing the need for consumers to buy battery replacements before other failure mechanisms in a device take effect.

Afterlife (play)

Afterlife is a 2008 play by Michael Frayn. It tells the life and career of Austrian theatrical director and actor Max Reinhardt, from the revival of the Salzburg Festival in 1920, which he helped to re-establish, until his death in New York in 1943. It draws from Hugo von Hofmannsthal's 1911 play Jedermann (based on the sixteenth-century English morality play, Everyman), which Reinhardt directed at the Salzburg Festival for many years following its revival in 1920.
"Afterlife" was first performed in the Lyttelton auditorium of the National Theatre, London, on 11 June 2008.
The National Theatre production was directed by Michael Blakemore. The cast included Roger Allam as Max Reinhardt, Abigail Cruttenden as his mistress (and, later, wife) Helene Thimig, Selina Griffiths as his personal assistant Gusti Adler, Peter Forbes as his man of business, Rudolf 'Katie' Kommer, Glyn Grain as his valet Franz, David Burke as the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg, and David Schofield as Friedrich Müller.

It began in Australia in 1907, when the New South Wales Rugby League was formed as a professional competition, following the rules of the Northern Rugby Football Union in England. Since then the state has been one of the major centres of the code; the headquarters of the Australian Rugby League are in New South Wales' largest city, Sydney. The premier state-level league is the New South Wales Cup, involving reserve teams from NSW and Canberra based NRL clubs as well as the first teams from other clubs.
History.
Conducting its inaugural meeting in 1865, the now defunct Sydney Football Club holds the honour of being Australia's first rugby club. The inaugural Sydney club competition was in 1874, competed by the Balmain Rugby Union Football Club, Newington College, Uni and The King's School.
Arguments over the differences in the playing rules followed by each club or school led the formation of the "Southern Rugby Football Union" (later renamed as the New South Wales Rugby Union). 
By the 1890s Rugby football had taken hold in New South Wales, thwarting attempts by Victorian rules and soccer to gain the ascendancy. The game continued to grow becoming the most popular code of football in NSW until the issue of professionalism led to the schism in 1908 and the formation of the New South Wales Rugby Football League. The NSWRU lost many players including the great Dally Messenger to the new sport of rugby league.
Governing body.
The New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) is the governing body for rugby league in New South Wales and is a member of the Australian Rugby League.
The New South Wales Country Rugby League (NSWCRL) is the governing body for rugby league in areas of New South Wales outside the Sydney metropolitan area and for the Australian Capital Territory.
National Rugby League.
The National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's top level competition for the sport of rugby league.
The headquarters of the National Rugby League (NRL) are in Sydney, which is home to 9 of the 16 National Rugby League (Sydney Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Parramatta Eels, Cronulla Sharks, Wests Tigers, Penrith Panthers, Bulldogs and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles), as well as being the northern home of the St George Illawarra Dragons, which is half-based in Wollongong.

Former competitions.
Royal Agricultural Society Shield.
The Royal Agricultural Society Shield, or RAS Shield was the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL)'s first premiership trophy. It was presented to each year's premiership winning rugby league team; the first to win three successive titles would take permanent ownership of the shield. The Eastern Suburbs club achieved this feat winning premierships in 1911, 1912 and 1913.
The hand crafted silver and oak designed shield was donated to the NSWRL by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales in its first year of competition.
Leading journalist Claude Corbett wrote in Sydney, Sun, newspaper on, May 1, 1914, ""The Royal Agricultural Society Shield, which was presented at the inception of the League's first grade competition has been won outright by Eastern Suburbs, who upset all calculations by winning the premiership three years in succession. The club has presented the shield to their captain, Dally Messenger, 'as a token of appreciation of his captaincy.""
In 1929 Jersey Flegg was appointed to the position of president of the NSWRFL.
J.J. Giltinan Shield.
In 1951, the NSWRFL originated the J.J. Giltinan Shield, following his death in 1950. This trophy was awarded to the premiers of the NSWRFL competition, being named after one of the founding fathers of the NSWRFL and rugby league in Australia. The trophy remains today, being awarded to the minor premiers of the National Rugby League competition. 
Following Jersey Flegg's death in 1960, Bill Buckley was made the NSWRFL's new president.
The NSWRFL had also commenced a very popular and successful mid-week competition in 1974, originally known as the Amco Cup, but later as the Tooth Cup and the National Panasonic Cup. The success of this competition, which included teams from both Brisbane and New Zealand, ultimately created pressure for further expansion in the NSWRFL competition. 
In 1980, the NSWRFL President Kevin Humphries, was instrumental in the establishment of the State of Origin series between teams representing the NSWRFL and Queensland Rugby League (QRL). The immediate success of this series, which remains the premier representative competition in Australia, and the overriding success of the Queensland team further pressured the NSWRFL to expand the club competition outside the boundaries of the state.
Sydney suburban teams came and went throughout the NSWRFL's history but it was not until 1982 that the competition included expansion outside of the Sydney area. This corresponded with the adoption of commercial sponsorship of the competition for the first time, the Winfield Cup. The two new inclusions were from the Australian Capital Territory - the Canberra Raiders - as well as a team from the southern New South Wales region - the Illawarra Steelers.
Winfield Cup.
The magnificent Winfield Cup trophy remains a permanent symbol of one of the game's most successful eras. Cast in bronze by Alan Ingham, it was the game's ultimate prize for the duration of the Winfield sponsorship from 1982-95.
Based on John O’Gready's world famous photograph of Norm Provan (St George) and Arthur Summons (Wests) after the 1963 Grand Final, the trophy represented the premiership pinnacle for players in the Winfield Era. Its image of the big man and the little man encompasses many of the finer things about Rugby League – the mateship after battle, the satisfaction of the shared experience on the playing field – no matter how hard and tough the struggle has been, the message that Rugby League, for all its professionalism, is still a game.
The Winfield Cup captured these and many other enduring things about League in its primary image, “The Gladiators” and the famous trophy, like the JJ Giltinan Shield, remains an important part of the game's heritage.
The League's name was changed in 1984 to the New South Wales Rugby League and Ken Arthurson became the new chairman. In 1988, two Queensland teams joined the competition, with the inclusions of the Brisbane Broncos and the Gold Coast-Tweed Giants seeing the game move beyond the outer borders of New South Wales. At the same a team from the Hunter region of New South Wales was included, with the return of a Newcastle franchise. Their return was the end of an 79 year wait in the wilderness and this time around the franchise was badged the Newcastle Knights.
The Winfield Cup competition was handed over to the control of the Australian Rugby League for the 1995 season, with the inclusion of teams from North Queensland, Western Australia and New Zealand. This period of expansion created tremendous success for the competition and rugby league in general. Over 3 million fans attended competition matches in the 1995 season and this figure remains the record for a single season attendance until this day.
Representative.
NSWRL manages the New South Wales State of Origin team as well the NSW Residents, Jim Beam Cup, under-19s, under-17s and under-16s and Indigenous rugby league teams. These teams traditionally play against teams from the Queensland Rugby League.
City vs Country is an annual match that takes place between a City side selected by the NSWRL and a Country side selected by New South Wales Country Rugby League.It is played before the Rugby League State of Origin series and is often referred to as a selection trial for the New South Wales Blues team.
The annual State of Origin series between the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons is the most popular sporting event in NSW. Sydney has hosted many State of Origin matches since the series began in 1980. The three game series are held in Sydney and Brisbane with the first and third games in one city and the second in the other. These rotate every year, so if two games are played in Sydney one year, then those games are played in Brisbane the next.

Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway

The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway ("Großherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn" or "M.F.F.E.") was the state railway company in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. After its second nationalisation in 1890 up to the merger of the "Länderbahnen" into the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1920 it was under the direction of the Grand Duchy's Executive Railway Board ("Großherzoglichen General-Eisenbahndirection" or "GGED") in Schwerin.
Context.
Mecklenburg is a region in northern Germany comprising the western and larger part of the present day state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Its largest cities are Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg. In 1815, the two Mecklenburg duchies - Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz - were raised to Grand Duchies, and subsequently existed separately in Germany until the end of World War I. The earlier private railways were nationalised by 1890 into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway.
En Route to a state railway.
First railways in Mecklenburg.
The first railway route in Mecklenburg was the Prussian Berlin–Hamburg line, which opened in 1846. As a result, stations appeared in Ludwigslust and Hagenow and other places. On 10 March 1846 the Mecklenburg Railway Company was given the concession to build a route from Hagenow to Schwerin and on to Wismar, and via Bützow to Rostock with a branch to Güstrow. On 13 May 1850 the line was finished.
The Friedrich-Franz railway.
Although the "Mecklenburg Railway Company" had completed the line, it lacked an east-west link that would also connect to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
Because there were no financially influential backers, the route Güstrow - Teterow – Malchin – Neubrandenburg was built on the initiative of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin under sovereign ownership. The route was opened on 11 November 1864 at Teterow station in the presence of both the Mecklenburg grand dukes. This was followed in 1867 by a railway connexion over the Prussian border to Strasburg (Uckermark). The railway division established its headquarters in Malchin. To continue the route as far as Lübeck the "Lübeck-Kleinen Railway Company" was founded and it was given the concession on 20 December 1865 to build the line. After 1868 its construction had to be discontinued due to a lack of funding; the state took over the line on 24 April 1870 and began operations on 1 July 1870 between Kleinen and Lübeck. In Lübeck the Friedrich-Franz line built its own goods station, called the "Lübeck Mecklenburg marshalling station". For passenger services it shared the "Lübeck-Büchen railway"'s station.
First nationalisation.
The desire for state control over the construction and operation of railways led in 1873 to the nationalisation of the railways in Mecklenburg. The Mecklenburg government also wanted to preempt the purchase of the railways by the Reich railways planned by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The operating profits of the "Mecklenburg Railway Company" were another reason for the takeover.
On 20 April 1873 the state government bought the "Mecklenburg Railway Company" and merged it with the "Friedrich-Franz Railway" into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway. The headquarters of the company was moved from Malchin to the state capital, Schwerin.
Reprivatisation.
In 1875 the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway was reprivatised. The reason was a dispute between the former railway shareholders and the government, because the latter could not pay back the circa 10 million thalers (30 million marks) from the railway purchase. The outcome of the dispute was the formation of the "Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway Company" ("Mecklenburgischen Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahngesellschaft" or "M.F.F.E.") as a limited company on 2 April 1875. This private railway company existed until the second nationalisation on 1 February 1890. Under the M.F.F.E. a railway line was built between Waren und Malchin.
Between 1875 and 1890 a multitude of new railway routes emerged, built by private railway concerns.
Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway.
On the second nationalisation in 1889/1890 the management of the state railway was transferred to the "GGED" (see above). The railway was known from then on as the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway ("Großherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn, M.F.F.E.")
In 1889/1890 all existing nine private railways were purchased by the state, the acquisition of the larger, more profitable companies taking a little longer.
The '"Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway" built a number of new routes in order to provide better rail transport services for the country:
Mecklenburg railway ferries on the Baltic Sea.
In 1903 the post steamer link from Warnemünde to Nykøbing/Falster, which had existed since 1886, was replaced by a railway ferry from Warnemünde to Gedser. The M.F.F.E. built a new station for it in Warnemünde and a harbour with two ferry berths. For the ferry traffic, two ferries were purchased: the ""Friedrich-Franz IV"" and the ""Mecklenburg"". The ferry line was operated jointly with the Danish State Railways. The ferry line enabled direct, through trains possible from Berlin to Copenhagen.
War, November Revolution, Deutsche Reichsbahn.
The onset of the First World War started the last chapter for the M.F.F.E. Railway traffic was reprioritised to support the war. Railway officials were called to war to an unprecedented extent. Railway materiel had to be given to other railways and railway operations were coordinated under the direction of the military across state and railway administration boundaries.
After the November Revolution and the abdication of the Grand Duke on 13 November 1918 the railways were renamed the "Mecklenburg State Railway" ("Mecklenburgische Landeseisenbahn") and transferred to the Reich Railways (Deutsche Reichsbahn) in accordance with the requirements of the Weimar Reich Constitution. The management authority for the "Reichseisenbahnen" in Mecklenburg was the Reichsbahn division of Schwerin.
Locomotives in Mecklenburg.
Mecklenburg centred its procurement of locomotives on its largest neighbour, Prussia. As far as possible, Prussian designs were used. One genuine Mecklenburg engine was the T 4, a tank locomotive for branch line operations. In contrast to other German railway administrations the M.F.F.E. ordered no express train locomotives. The transportation of international express trains from Berlin via Warnemünde and Gedser to Copenhagen and the fast trains from Rostock to Hamburg were handled by Prussian P 8s, that with a top speed of 100 km/h had sufficiently high speeds for those services.
An overview of the engines used by the M.F.F.E. is given in the List of Mecklenburg locomotives.
Memories of the M.F.F.E. today.
Only a few signs of Mecklenburg' former railway are left today. In Schwerin the building of the Grand Duchy's Executive Railway Board ("Großherzoglichen General-Eisenbahndirection"), which housed the Reichsbahn division of Schwerin until its disbandment, still stands. On the routes there are a few incline markers with the characteristic M.F.F.E. in the centre and the functional, yet attractive, old station buildings from the early days of the railway, for example in Teterow, Malchin and Stavenhagen. Other memorabilia from the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway are housed by the Molli Museum at Kühlungsborn-West station on the so-called "Molli's Spa Railway" ("Bäderbahn Molli").

David Joaquín Guzmán

Dr. David Joaquín Guzmán (1843-1927) was an Salvadoran scientist, archeologist, museum curator and educator.
Early life and education.
Son of the general Joaquín Eufrasio Guzmán, that was President of El Salvador, he became a Bachelor of Philosophy, at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala. During his university studies he adopted the principles of European liberalism. In 1862, he travelled to Europe and in 1869 he received the rank of Doctor of Medicine in Paris.
Career.
In 1870 he returned to El Salvador, and the following year he was chosen to represent the Constituent National Assembly, summoned by the then president Santiago González. His service in the Constituent Assembly in the capital was a short one, and he soon returned to his native San Miguel where he dedicated himself to scientific research. He initiated a series of geological investigations and undertook the botanical studies of classifying the flora and the fauna of the north of San Miguel and Chalatenango.
In 1872, Guzmán served under the cabinet of President González, as an Undersecretary of Public Instruction and Outer Relations. In 1874 he helped establish the Escuela de Artes y Oficios de San Salvador (School of Arts and Offices) in San Salvador. That same year, when treating the epidemic of smallpox in some areas of the country, Guzmán headed the campaign of vaccination, promoted by the state.
In 1875, Guzmán and Darío González organized an expedition of geological investigation into residues of the Los Frailes River, southwest of Ilobasco. During this exploration, they discovered fossils of Mastodon.
Between 1881 and 1887, Guzmán worked as a university professor of medicine and botany at the University of El Salvador. On October 9, 1883, on the initiative of Guzmán, president Rafael Zaldívar opened the National Museum of El Salvador, to display the national collections related to archaeology, history and fine arts. Being responsible for its establishment and much of its content, Guzmán became the first director of the museum. In 1886 he was elect deputy to the Constituent National Assembly summoned by Francisco Menéndez. In the Constituent Assembly, Guzmán promoted the adoption of legislation according to the liberal principles which he had encountered during his early period in Europe.
In 1891, Guzmán travelled to Costa Rica to head a scientific expedition. Between 1896 and 1898, he resided in Nicaragua, where on impulse, he founded an anthropology museum.
In 1916, Guzmán won a literary contest, summoned by the state under president Carlos Melendez, to create an Oration to the Salvadoran Flag.
During his life, Guzmán wrote journalistic poetry and articles that were compiled in various volumes. Most notably, his "Escogidas works" (Obras Escogidas) were published after his death. The museum that founded was named in its honor, the National Museum of Anthropology is named Dr. David Joaquin Guzmán".

Megohmmeter

Megohmmeter (sometimes referred to as a megger) is a special type of ohmmeter used to measure the electrical resistance of insulators. Insulating components, for example cable jackets, must be tested for their insulation strength at the time of commissioning and as part of maintenance of high voltage electrical equipment and installations. For this purpose megohmmeters, which can provide high DC voltages (typically in ranges from 500V to 2kV) at specified current capacity, are used. Acceptable insulator resistance values are typically 1 to 10 megohms, depending on the standards referenced.

MS Silver Explorer

M/V "Silver Explorer" is an expedition ship currently operated by Silversea Cruises.
History.
The ship was built by the yards of Rauma-Repola, of Rauma, Finland, and launched on 3 February 1989. She operated under several names before being acquired by Society Expeditions, who operated her under the names "World Adventurer" and "World Discoverer". 
She was purchased by Silversea Cruises in autumn 2007, and underwent a multi-million pound refit at Fincantieri, Trieste. In June 2008, at a ceremony in Monte Carlo attended by Prince Albert II of Monaco, she was re-christened "Prince Albert II". She then sailed to London to embark passengers for an inaugural cruise.
"Prince Albert II" was renamed "Silver Explorer" in late April 2011 in order to align with the fleet's other vessels which all have the word Silver in their name.
Service.
"M/V Silver Explorer" operates polar adventure cruises lasting between 10 and 21 days. In the summer she cruises in the Arctic Circle with calls at the Svalbard archipelago, Iceland and Greenland. During the northern hemisphere autumn and winter, she cruises off South America and Antarctica.
Design.
"M/V Silver Explorer" is a 1A ice-rated vessel. She carries up to 132 passengers in 66 cabins, and is equipped with a library, lecture theatre and internet centre.

Rosherville Halt railway station

Rosherville Halt was a railway station on the Gravesend West Line which was built to serve the popular Rosherville Gardens, a pleasure garden in Gravesend, Kent which closed in 1910. The station survived a further 23 years before itself closing in 1933.
History.
The route of the Gravesend West branch through Gravesend adjoined the famous Rosherville Pleasure Gardens which had opened in 1839 on land leased by the Rosher family who gave their name to the popular attraction. Although the Gardens were already served by steamer, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway decided to open a station in the hope of attracting some of their custom. It was an initially successful venture with 14,000 people visiting Rosherville Gardens on Whit Sunday in 1886, many of whom arrived by rail. However, the steamers were not going to give up their passengers without a fight and began to undercut the fares charged by the railway company. In the event, the popularity of Rosherville Gardens was on the wane and it eventually closed in 1910. Dwindling traffic led to the station being downgraded to an unstaffed halt in 1928, before eventually closing in 1933.
As with Southfleet and Longfield stations, Rosherville Halt was situated in a cutting near a road overbridge from which a footbridge led down to a single island platform. Rosherville lay just to the west of a bridge carrying the A226 Dartford - Gravesend road over the line. The covered footbridge complete with two generously wide staircases to accommodate the expected traffic to Rosherville Gardens led from the station buildings at ground level to the platform. Two wooden canopy sections were installed on the platform, and a signal box was installed in a recess in the brick retaining wall on the down side of the station. A stationmaster's house was sited some distance from the main station buildings, overlooking the cutting.
Post-closure.
The signal box was removed following closure and the ground level buildings were subsequently converted into domestic use. The platform buildings remained intact until the mid-1960s. The line through the station was closed in 1968 when freight traffic ceased at Gravesend West. What remained was swept away when the trackbed of the Gravesend Branch from Vale Road as far as Gravesend West was converted into the A2260 Thames Way. The cutting was deepened and widened requiring the demolition of the dilapidated stationmaster's house. Only the former railway tunnel to the north-east of the station, now part of the A2260, remains as the surviving remnant of the railway which once served Rosherville.

D424 road (Croatia)

D424 is a state road in Croatia that connects the city of Zadar with the A1 motorway. It links Gaženica port in southern Zadar and Zadar 2 interchange on A1 motorway, executed as a dual carriage expressway () connector, with a speed limit. The D424 has five interchanges. The expressway has been regarded in Zadar as a means, which will, together with the new Gaženica port and the Crno commercial zone, bring prosperity to the city.
The road, as well as all other state roads in Croatia, is managed and maintained by Hrvatske ceste, state owned company.
Traffic volume.
Traffic is regularly counted and reported by Hrvatske ceste, operator of the road. Substantial variations between annual (AADT) and summer (ASDT) traffic volumes are attributed to the fact that the road connects a number of summer resorts to Croatian motorway network.

History.
Junctions 10 to 13 of the M20 motorway were opened in 1981. Prior to the construction of the services, the proposed site was subjected to an archaeological investigation. This was because the area was close to known archaeological sites. Shards of pottery dating from the 1st–4th centuries were discovered and there may have been a Roman settlement between the current site of the services and line of the nearby Roman road from Lympne to Canterbury.

Taranaki Herald

The Taranaki Herald was an afternoon daily newspaper, published in New Plymouth, New Zealand. It began publishing as a four-page tabloid on 4 August 1852 and until it ceased publication in 1989 was the oldest daily newspaper in the country.
The newspaper was founded by William Collins and Garland William Woon, who hired William Morgan Crompton as its first editor. It began as a weekly paper, moved to twice-weekly publication in 1867 and began appearing daily in 1877.
Crompton was replaced as editor in 1854 by Richard Pheney, who in quit in November 1856 when he opposed the newspaper owner's support for George Cutfield over Charles Brown as Taranaki Superintendent. In May 1857 Pheney was appointed as the first editor of a rival newspaper, the "Taranaki News", which changed its name to the "Taranaki Daily News" when it began daily publication three years later.
Woon, who took over as editor following Pheney's departure, became renowned for his reporting of conflicts between imperial forces and local Māori in the First Taranaki War, with his paper being sold by subscription throughout Europe. In May 1860 he was accused by military authorities of writing material that could give "information to the enemy" after criticising the defence of the town and he ran an issue with one offending paragraph removed, the white space being filled with fullpoints. It remained the one and only time the "Herald" was censored.
In late 1867 the paper was sold to Henry Weston and his family retained strong links with the paper for the next 111 years. Weston was sole proprietor until 1920; his nephew Walter C. Weston took over until 1930 when it was registered as a private company. Weston remained as chairman and managing director and his wife, Lillian Weston, was a director until her death in 1978.
In 1962, the "Taranaki Herald" and "Taranaki Daily News", both of which were struggling with rising costs and the need for updated equipment, were amalgamated as Taranaki Newspapers Ltd, a subsidiary of NZ News Ltd, which owned the "Auckland Star" and "Christchurch Star". Publication was merged at the "Herald" building in Currie St, New Plymouth, which it had occupied since 1900, and while the administration and publishing activity was combined, the editorial departments were kept separate and stayed fiercely competitive. Taranaki Newspapers was bought by Independent Newspapers Ltd (INL) in 1989, which closed the "Herald" because of falling circulation and advertising volumes.
Other newspapers published by the "Herald" included the "Budget" and the "Taranaki Weekly Herald" (1877-1932), the "Sports Herald" (1926–30, 1946-1972) and during World War II a special weekly "Overseas News Sheet" for servicemen.
Editors included: William Seffern (1868-1895), Walter J. Penn (1895-1932), G. H. Dolby (1932-1937), A. B. Scanlan (1937-1965), Rash Avery 1965-1973), George Koea (1973-1987) and Lance Girling-Butcher (1987–89).
Its journalists have included June Litman, New Zealand's first female news editor, broadcaster Derryn Hinch, Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki (WITT) journalism head Jim Tucker, INL boss Rick Neville, former "Dominion" editor Richard Long, Australian Seven Network head Ray Cleaver and singer Lew Pryme.

Cortinarius semisanguineus

Cortinarius semisanguineus is a medium-sized mushroom with a pale brown to ochre cap, and bright blood-red gills. It belongs to the genus "Cortinarius", a group collectively known as webcaps. It is found growing in conifer plantations, and has recently been given the fanciful common name of surprise webcap. In the past it has been called the red-gilled webcap.
Taxonomy.
This mushroom is placed by some authorities in the genus "Dermocybe". Most mycologists retain "Dermocybe" as merely a subgenus of "Cortinarius". The group contains almost 30 species. The species name "semisanguineus" means 'half blood-red', a reference to the gill colour, as compared with "Cortinarius sanguineus" which is wholly blood-red.
Description.
The cap is campanulate (bell-shaped), and later flattens, but retains a broad umbo (shield-like central boss). It is usually between 2–8 cm (0.8–3.4 in) across, brownish ochre, or umber and with a darker centre. It is covered in fine fibrils, and is dry. The stipe is usually the same colour as the cap or paler, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose like the cap. It is long, slim, and cylindrical. Cortinal remnants often left on the stem in this species can be quite fleeting. The gills are adnate, markedly sinuate, and fairly crowded. They are initially blood-red, but turn cinnamon-brown on aging, giving a spore print of the same colour. The flesh is said to smell of radishes, and it is ochre in the stem, but more olive in the cap.
A similar species, "Cortinarius phoeniceus" has a redder cap, and more distinct red cortinal remnants around the stem.
Distribution and habitat.
"Cortinarius semisanguineus" appears in conifer, or mixed conifer, and birch woods in autumn (fall). It is occasional in Britain, Europe, Scandinavia, and parts of North America. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with birch trees ("Betula"), and other coniferous softwood trees. It is often abundant under young spruce in plantations on acid soil, appearing from August to November.
Edibility.
"Cortinarius semisanguineus" cannot be recommended for the table as it is suspected of being toxic; it may contain similar poisonous compounds to those found in deadly "Cortinarius", such as "C. orellanus" and its close relatives.
Other uses.
"Cortinarius semisanguineus" can be used as a dye for textile yarns.

Paul Thomson (botanist)

Paul Thomson (June 29, 1916 – May 31, 2008) was an American exotic fruit enthusiast, self-taught botanist, fruit farmer and the co-founder of the California Rare Fruit Growers Association, a group of amateur horticulturists which now has more than 3,000 members in approximately 35 countries. Thomson is credited with helping to expand the farming of exotic fruits in California - everything from cherimoyas to longans to pitahayas.
Early life.
Paul Thomson was born on June 29, 1916, in India to parents, Clinton and Bertha Mangon Thomson. His mother was a doctor who ran a local Indian hospital while his father was a minister. Tragedy struck the family when Thomson was hunting with his father when he was 11 years old. His father had shot two ducks for the family's Christmas dinner, but drowned while trying to retrieve them from a lake.
Thomson, his mother and his four younger sisters returned to the United States following his father's death. The family settled in his parents' native Nebraska, where his mother set up a medical practice. Thomson raised chickens, churned butter and grew potatoes during the Great Depression to earn money for his family. Thomson graduated from high school in 1934 and enrolled in Nebraska Wesleyan University for two years, but dropped out in 1937 due to unaffordable tuition costs. Following his departure from NWU, he briefly worked as an installer of telegraph lines for Western Union and early railroad-signal control systems in Colorado. He also worked as a wheat and turkey farmer for a short period of time.
Thomson enlisted in the United States Marines in 1938, a year after dropping out of college. He served as a chemical warfare instructor during World War II. He later ran a U.S. military sawmill to produce lumber for military operations in Korea during the Korean War. Another of his assignments in Korea was to monitor horticultural operations, which would lead to a lifelong interest in plants. The Marines stationed him at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego during the 1950s, which brought Thomson to Southern California. One of his duties in San Diego was working in the base's nursery.
California Rare Fruit Growers.
Thomson began experimenting with rare fruits during the early 1950s after being stationed in San Diego. He and his wife, Helen, purchased five acres (2 ha) of land in Bonsall, California, in 1952. The couple initially lived in a trailer on the land while they were building their home. He began experimenting with tropical fruits and fruit trees that were usually found in climates warmer than that part of Southern California. Thomson initially planted papayas, lychees, mangoes, longans and other tropical species on his new farm. However, most of his attempts to grow these fruits were a failure due to freezing temperatures during the winters. For example, mangoes could not survive the winter climate in Bonsall.
Thomson decided to make another attempt at growing tropical fruits with a second farm in a different location. In 1962, Thomson purchased another small farm in Vista, California, and called it Edgehill. His newest farm and orchard was only five miles (8 km) from his other property in Bonsall, but it had a much milder climate, especially during the winter. This made Edgehill more conducive to growing tropical, exotic fuits that had not been previously grown in California. He was able to finally grow successful harvests of mangoes, cherimoyas, lychees and other fruits.
The "Los Angeles Times" reported in 1971 that Thomson was able to grow 96 separate types of fruit between his two orchards in Bonsall and Edgehill. Most of these fruits had not been widely grown in the United States before Thomson planted them on his properties. Thomson grew the first successful Mammee apple crop, also known as the South American apricot or the mamey, of note in California. He also ran the only longan orchard in the United States at the time. A friend of Thomson, Jim Neitzel, said that his Edgehill farm soon attracted the attention of other botanists and tropical fruit enthusiasts. "His Edgehill property was the biggest feather in his cap. People would come from all over the state to check it out."
However, lack of demand for Thomson's fruits in the marketplace at the time forced him to close the Edgehill property in 1972. In a 1989 interview with the "San Diego Union-Tribune" Thomson told the newspaper that, "I was 20 years ahead of my time...I never made enough to pay the water bill, let alone make any money."
Thomson, an organic farmer, continued to earn his living by budding and grafting fruit trees for grove owners and nurseries throughout California. He also continued to grow cherimoyas and mangoes to be sold throughout Southern California. In particular, Thomson devoted much of his time to propagating tropical and subtropical fruits that would grow in San Diego's North County.

Thomson and John Riley, a Lockheed engineer from Santa Clara, California, and fellow fruit enthusiast, began working together to publish a newsletter beginning in 1960. Riley and Thomson published the early newsletters for years using a mimeograph machine. The newsletter lead to the foundation of the California Rare Fruit Growers Association (CRFG) in 1968, as an organization and clearinghouse for rare exotic fruit enthusiasts, hobbyists and amateur horticulturists. Today the California Rare Fruit Growers publishes a glossy, bimonthly magazine, "The Fruit Gardener", an outgrowth of the early, mimeographed newsletters. The California Rare Fruit Growers Association currently has over 3,000 members in approximately 35 countries worldwide. The CRFG claims to be the largest amateur fruit-growing organization in the world.
The Association rapidly grew in California during the late 1960s, in part because many newcomers were moving to the state "without prejudice to what could not be grown" in California. Thomson's organization became a driving force behind the growing availability of exotic fruits throughout California's supermarkets and farmers markets.
Dudleya Researcher, Grower and Publisher.
Paul appears to have become interested in the Crassulaceaen succulents of the genus Dudleya. The Dudleya closely resemble the more commonly known Echeverias. Early publications actually listed the Dudleya under either the Echeveria or Cotyledon genera. This genus resides primarily in California and Baja California, Mexico and consists of approximately 60 named species. Limited literature and a passion to learn more on the plants that had piqued his interest, Paul set forth on gathering specimens, assembling descriptions, drawing habitat location maps and taking photographs which all culminated in his privately publishing the Dudleya and Hassenthaus Handbook in 1993. Of note are his SEM photographs of the flowers. It is still the only book dedicated to the genus and contains numerous photographs of specimens in the wild and his own collection. Paul shared his plants freely and supporters provided specimens from their respective collecting trips. Paul shared his insights into their hybridization with avid enthusiasts and his findings were later confirmed as naturally occurring, as he had suspected. Most of his collection was lost during a severe freeze but his legacy lives on. His contributions to the knowledge of this Genus is overshadowed by his work on the rare fruits.
Death.
Paul Thomson died on May 31, 2008 at the age of 91, of complications related to old age, at a retirement home in Fallbrook, California. He was survived by his four younger sisters, Margaret Greiber, Catharine Kingsolver, Alice Hasenyager and Ellen Hanly. His wife, Helen, died in 2007. They had been married for 65 years.

European Bridges Ensemble

The European Bridges Ensemble (EBE) was established for Internet and network music performance. Its current members are the five performers Kai Niggemann (Münster, Germany), Ádám Siska (Budapest, Hungary), Johannes Kretz (Vienna, Austria), Andrea Szigetvári (Dunakeszi, Hungary), Ivana Ognjanović (Belgrade, Serbia), the conductor and software designer Georg Hajdu (Hamburg, Germany), and video artist Stewart Collinson (Lincoln, England). 
Using the term bridges as a metaphor, the Ensemble attempts to bridge cultures, regions, locations and individuals, each with their specific history. Particularly, Europe with its historical and ethnic diversity has repeatedly gone through massive changes separating and reuniting people often living in close vicinity. The aim is to further explore the potential of taking participating musicians and artists out of their political and social isolation by creating virtual communities of like-minded artists united by their creativity and mutual interests.
The first Bridges concert on 17 June 2005 (simultaneously in Münster, Stuttgart and Vienna) brought together musicians from the former West (Austria and Germany) and East (Hungary and Serbia) – all connected by the river Danube – and thus demonstrated the potential of Internet performance as a means to overcome national borders and political single-mindedness.
Network Music and Quintet.net.
The term "network music" is often used to refer to musical activities that utilise computer network technologies in a performative context. Network music can be performed by laptop ensembles, for example PLOrk, SLOrk, The Hub, or PowerBooks_UnPlugged. The extent to which network technology is utilised in performance can vary. EBE's implementation of network music involves the use of software called Quintet.net which was developed by the ensemble's co-founder, Georg Hajdu, using Max/MSP/Jitter. 
The basic concept of Quintet.net is that there's a "conductor" and several (up to five) performers (or "client"s), connected to each other using a central "server". The clients get instructions from the conductor. These instructions can be messages sent to the clients, but usually it is a score part to play. On the other hand, control data created by the clients are sent back to the network. This latter, combined with the fact that an unlimited number of clients can connect to the server in a so called "listener" mode (that is, a mode where the client only receives data but doesn't send control data back) lets anyone connect to the server and listen the music being played in real time.
Since the network is only used to send control data (using Open Sound Control) and the music itself is always created locally, the normal household bandwidths are generally sufficient to transmit all the data needed for the platform. This means that the performers don't need to be "physically" present at the performance's place, but can play from anywhere in the Globe (this is a big difference compared to the usual concept of musical performance, and at the time when the Ensemble was founded, the EBE was the only group playing music in a Wide Area Network). As an example, during the first concert of the Ensemble the performers were located at four different cities of Europe (Budapest, Münster, Stuttgart and Vienna), and the concert itself was broadcast at three different concert halls (and, of course, the Internet) in Münster, Stuttgart and Vienna at the same time.
After video artist Stewart Collinson joined the EBE, the original Quintet.net concept was expanded with a new tool called "Viewer", which is an extension that makes Quintet.net able to manage video mixing as well.
Repertoire.
The ensemble plays pieces mostly written by the members of the group itself, but music by outside composers is played occasionally as well.
The first music written for EBE was Bridges, a work of five movements composed by "Kai Niggemann", "Marlon Schumacher", "Johannes Kretz", "Andrea Szigetvári" and "Ivana Ognjanović" in 2005. Each movement was composed by a different musician, and every movement reflects somehow on the city where the actual musician lives (in other words, there is a movement about "Münster", "Stuttgart", "Vienna", "Budapest" and "Belgrade"). It was first performed on the Internet with live broadcast in Münster, Stuttgart and Vienna on 17 June 2005.
A similar piece is Quintessence, also with five movements, each one about one of the five elements. The composers are "Kai Niggemann" (Earth), "Marlon Schumacher" (Fire), "Johannes Kretz" (Quintessence), "Andrea Szigetvári" (Air) and "Ivana Ognjanović" (Water). It was composed in 2007 and first played during the Music in the Global Village conference on 6 September 2007.
Ivresse '84 (composed by Ensemble leader "Georg Hajdu" in 2007) is the first piece for the group where only four laptop players are needed as the fifth player is replaced by a violinist. The piece reflects on the riot that happened during the premiere of the first two books of John Cage's Freeman Etudes in Ivrea (Turin), in 1984. It was first performed during the Music in the Global Village conference on 6 September 2007 by János Négyesy, the same violinist who played the Etudes on the original premiere.
The first piece having also text spoken was Keep Calm and Carry On. The text is a dialogue written by "Maria Popara" and "Kai Niggemann" using the typical slang of chat. The music was composed by "Kai Niggemann" in 2007, and the piece was also first performed during the Music in the Global Village conference on 6 September 2007.
Anne La Berge, a composer and flutist composed Brokenheart for LOOS Ensemble and EBE in 2007, where the goal was to write a piece where the laptop ensemble plays together with an acoustic ensemble (including flute, piano and percussion). It was first played during the Music in the Global Village conference on 6 September 2007.
In 2007 the Ensemble was invited to play at a concert of Projekt Bipolar in Berlin on 13 October 2007. There was a young composers' competition ""Hommage à György Ligeti"" among the activities of Projekt Bipolar, and the prizes were given to the winners also during this concert. For this event, EBE commissioned a piece from "Sascha Lino Lemke". Netze spinnen # Spinnennetze is a work where the five players are split in space. The material used by "Lemke" relates in several ways to Ligeti's music, including the use of metronomes and other polyrhythmical solutions.
Ensemble member "Ádám Siska" wrote his piece 185 in 2008 (first performed during the Hamburger Klangwerktage 2008 Festival on 26 November 2008). This was the first piece in the repertoire not using sampling techniques at all.
The Ensemble created also transcriptions of two pieces of John Cage. One was Five (composed in 1988, EBE version first performed on 27 April 2006), the other was Radio Music (composed in 1956, transcribed by Georg Hajdu in 2008, EBE version first performed on 26 November 2008).
In 2010 EBE was invited to perform a concert in collaboration with Marek Chołoniewski as part of the European Capital of Culture program taking place in Pécs, Hungary that year.
Concerts.
The founding event of EBE was the "Lange Musik Nacht" on 17 June 2005. Conductor Georg Hajdu and performers Ivana Ognjanović and Marlon Schumacher were in Stuttgart, Kai Niggemann in Münster, Johannes Kretz in Wien and Andrea Szigetvári in Budapest. The piece played was Bridges, and it demonstrated that the idea of playing music via Wide Area Network is possible. This same piece was performed again on a concert a year later, where the whole Ensemble played in a Local Area Network at the "Making New Waves 2006" festival in Budapest, Hungary.
This concert was followed by a long pause: next time the band appeared again on stage was only in early Autumn 2007 at the "Music in the Global Village Conference" Budapest (this was the first international conference dedicated exclusively to network music composition and performance). Here, the opening concert was played by the EBE, together with Anne La Berge and the LOOS Ensemble. The conference itself was part of "Projekt-Bipolar", a two years long German-Hungarian cultural programme. The Ensemble had two more concerts organized by members of Projekt-Bipolar during October 2007 in Berlin, Germany. These included the closing concert of Projekt Bipolar and also the closing event of a young composers' competition.
During 2008 the band played on five concerts at three festivals: two subsequent nights during the ICMC 2008 at the "Whitla Hall" in Belfast., two concerts at the "Klangwerktage 2008" festival in Hamburg (from which one was a Wide Area Network concert with ensemble member Johannes Kretz playing from Krems, Austria) and one at "Making New Waves 2008" festival in Budapest, Hungary. After this last concert, the Hungarian Television made an interview presenting the Ensemble.
In 2009 the Ensemble had concerts in Prague at the Enter4 festival, the "Klangwerktage 2009" festival in Hamburg, the "Making New Waves 2009" festival with its second edition of the Music in the Global Village conference and a Wide Area Network concert at the SIGGRAPH Asia conference with ensemble members playing from Yokohama, Lincoln, Budapest and Belgrade.

Huis ter Nieuwburg

Huis ter Nieuwburg or Huis ter Nieuburch ("House at New Borough") was a palace in Rijswijk, Holland, Dutch Republic. The symmetrical French Classicist building was probably designed by the French architect Jacques de la Vallée and was built between 1633 and 1636 for stadtholder Prince Frederick Henry.
The palace with gardens was the country house of the Princes of Orange for years, and it was used for the peace negotiations resulting in the Treaty of Rijswijk in 1697. After the death of Prince William III in 1702, the palace was inherited by the Kings of Prussia, until it was given back to the Princes of Orange by King Frederick II.
The gardens of the palace were formal French Renaissance gardens constructed in 1636. In front of the palace were trees and "parterres" enclosed by walls. Behind the palace was a larger garden with four rectangular ponds.
The building, after being neglected for years, was demolished in 1790. At present, the area is woodland known as the Rijswijkse Bos. The only reminders of the palace are two of the ponds and an obelisk commemorating the peace treaty.
Building.
In 1630, stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange bought the old "Huis ter Nieuwburg" from Philibert Vernatti for ƒ 30,000 (€ 13,613). The house was located in the Plaspolder, a polder in the village Rijswijk, in between the cities The Hague and Delft. At that time, The Hague was the political center of the Dutch Republic where the States-General assembled, and Delft was the city where Prince Frederick Henry was born and where his father William the Silent had his residence and was assassinated and buried in 1584.
Between 1630 and 1632, the Prince of Orange bought more land and two houses in the area surrounding the house in order to build a new country house on the location of Vernatti's old house. The project of the new "Huis ter Nieuwburg" was tendered in 1633. The first pavilions of the palace were finished in 1634 and its roof was completed in 1636. During his life, Prince Frederick Henry had built large houses conform the newest styles in architecture and by the best available architects. It is probable that the French architect Jacques de la Vallée had designed this palace.
The symmetrical building was designed in the architectural style of French Classicism. The "corps de logis" with the main chambers of the palace was positioned on the axis of symmetry. At the back of the "corps de logis" was a lodge looking out on the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft through a corridor along the axis in the garden. In this church is the mausoleum of his father William the Silent and the crypt where Prince Frederick Henry's parents, brother, and two daughters were buried at the time the palace was built. Both on the east and the west side of the "corps de logis" is a wing, perpendicular to the axis, with a pavilion at the end.
Gardens.
The geometric Late Renaissance gardens and ponds were constructed by 1636. They were illustrated as they had become fully developed and matured in Jan van Vianen's engraving after Petrus Schenck, which records the grand diplomatic gathering that led to the Treaty of Rijswyck, signed in the house. The entire garden was surrounded by a rectangle of canals that drained the ground and formed the equivalent of a moat; around its inner banks allées of trees isolated the pleasure grounds from the featureless agricultural landscape outside.
Entry was across one of three bridges and through a formal woodland or "bocage", through which three drives were pierced: the central one led through a free-standing Doric portal—guarded by sentry-boxes on this occasion—that was centred on a pedimented central gate in the mock-battlemented wall that enclosed the paved and cobbled forecourt. Right and left of this axial entrance, reserved during the treaty negotiations for the Mediator, were matching unemphasised entrances—perhaps opened in the walling for the occasion—destined, as the engraving's legend specifies, for the French representatives on the right and for those of the Allies on the left; clearly, this will have avoided tense protocol confrontations over which coach would enter the "cour d'honneur" first.
The north front of the "Huis" with its paired corner pavilions was separated from the forecourt by a low balustraded terrace that created a privileged zone that protected the parade rooms from the immediate clatter of the courtyard and the inconvenient leavings of horses. For the duration of the negotiations, temporary brick walls had been erected to divide the entrance court from its flanking parterre gardens; in ordinary times, openings in the terrace balustrade and a few steps gave direct access to these gardens, where fruit trees were espaliered against the brick walls.
The central axis continued through the central rooms of the "corps de logis" and was extended as a wide gravelled walk down the axis of the pleasure grounds, which it divided symmetrically on either side; at the far end, the enclosing narrow band of trees drew back in a semi-circular exedra that parted at the center to afford a view of the church steeple of Delft on the horizon, centred on the garden axis.
The grounds thus enclosed and divided featured a symmetrical suite of six parterres that were planted—rather than with the clipped patterns relieved with colored gravel of Le Nôtre's Garden à la française manner—as formal "bosquets" of trees laid out quincunx-fashion and separated by wide gravelled walks. In the four outer corners of the grounds that were articulated by these shady sections were four rectangular ponds, the "vijvers" of which two survive today. At the outside front corners were a pair of mock fortifications with corner bastions all in tightly-clipped evergreens, entered by arched doorways.
Two separate gardens enclosed by brick walls extended east and west of the end pavilions. The eastward one was planted with evergreens surrounding a circular central rockwork fountain, from which is derived its name "De Rots", "The Rockery". The westward one was the "De Meloen Tuin", the melon garden.
Owners and tenants.
The palace was built as a country house and used by the Princes of Orange, the stadtholders of six of the seven provinces of the Dutch Republic, and the de facto rulers of the country.
In 1697, the palace was used for the negotiations that lead to the Treaty of Rijswijk. The treaty settled the Nine Years' War between France and the Grand Alliance of England, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic.
After the death of King William III of England, who was also the Prince of Orange, the house was under the supervision of the "Nassause Domeinraad" (English: "Domain Council of Nassau") from 1702 to 1732. After the inheritance of King William III was settled, the palace became the property of King Frederick William I of Prussia in 1732. His successor, King Frederick II of Prussia, gave the palace back to the Princes of Orange, to Prince William IV, as an act of friendship.
In 1753, the palace was rented to Count Golofkin, ambassador for Tsarina Anna of Russia.
Demolition.
In 1789, the architect P.W. Schonk advised Prince William V to demolish the palace, because it had been neglected for years. Also he advised to use the money raised by selling properties and real estate for a monument for the Treaty of Rijswijk. Following this advise, the palace was demolished in 1790 and the stables and the coach-house were sold in 1793. From 1792 to 1794, the "Naald van Rijswijk" (English: "Obelisk of Rijswijk") was built, an obelisk commemorating the peace treaty.
At present, the area around the obelisk is woodland known as the Rijswijkse Bos, which is open to the public. The only other reminders of "Huis ter Nieuwburg" are two rectangular ponds from the French gardens, now enclosed in woodland.
The Museum Rijswijk in Rijswijk has engravings, medals, and books related to the Treaty of Rijswijk and paintings of the palace in its collection.

Elsewhere (2009 novel)

Elsewhere (2009) is a novel by William Peter Blatty, released on May 15, 2009 through Cemetery Dance Publications. It was originally published as a novella in 1999 in Al Sarrantonio's "999: New Stories Of Horror And Suspense" anthology.
"Elsewhere" is studied in the 2008 publication "." The story follows a group of people who visit a supposedly haunted house. When other secrets appear, the group tries to find out what else the house has that is secret.
Plot.
Joan Freeboard, a Realtor, has been assigned to sell the house, Elsewhere, a house notorious for being haunted. She brings along her friend Terrence Dare, a writer, and psychic Anna Trawley to help investigate. When they arrive at the house they met up with paranormal investigator Gabriel Case. It is suggested that something is wrong with Gabriel Case as he acts as if he has met the group before saying, " Here you all are again" even though this is supposedly his first time meeting the group. 
Gabriel Case then tells them the story of Elsewhere telling them a doctor who once lived there killed his young wife and himself and they became the ghosts of Elsewhere. Gabriel Case also introduces his servant and it is evident that something is going on between the two, because after an argument between Terrence and Joan, Gabriel Case tells the servant, " See she forgives him." 
As the group stays at Elsewhere things get even stranger. Terrence opens a door only to find a family and two priests who throw holy water at him, burning him. When Anna and Joan go for a walk they notice they can no longer see any lights coming from the city even though it is just across from the island. The group then holds a seance where strange paranormal events occur. 
Terrence sees a dog even though there are no dogs at Elsewhere and a spirit spells out words for them on a Ouija board. Terrance is also having trouble remembering if he brought his dogs along with him and the other members of the group get strangely confused when he asks them. In the stories climax a paranormal entity attacks Joan and Terrence while they're in a room together, banging on the door furiously as it tries to get inside. 
When Anna and Gabriel return from a stroll on the beach, Joan and Terrence tell them what happened and Gabriel suggest they watch the video tapes from the cameras to see what happened. There are no paranormal events on the cameras and one of the group members then notices the dates on the camera are wrong. When they go back downstairs they are all killed by an invisible entity except for Gabriel who watches them get killed with a rather calm look on his face. 
The book than skips back to the beginning, only this time the characters realize events are repeating themselves. Gabriel then explains that the three died on their way to Elsewhere and that in refusing to go on they haunted the place, living in an endless cycle. Gabriel was then tasked to watch over them until they became aware of this cycle. The family and priests Terrence saw were the current owners of the house who had hired the priests to get rid of the ghosts. Gabriel then tells them that they are now able to go on and Joan and Terrence walk on to the afterlife were Terrence is reunited with his dogs. Anna Trawley although reluctant at first, is then lead by Gabriel to the afterlife. When she asks why he lied about the whole thing he tells her, "ghost lie."
Meanwhile back at the house the current owners are happy the ghosts are gone. It is revealed that Gabriel and the Servant were actually the doctor and his wife who had haunted the house before Joan, Terrence, and Anna showed up. One of the priests notices a painting on the wall of the house looks a lot like his partner. While walking down the beach the priests begin talking and one of them turns to the other, "but there was nobody there."
Characters.
Joan Freeboard- a Realtor assigned to sell Elsewhere, it is her that gathers the group together. She is very stubborn and has a no nonsense personality but is also described by Terrence as being vulnerable. Due to her stubborn personality she is the last to accept the haunting of Elsewhere.
Terrence Dare- A writer, and one of Joan's best friends, he was brought along to write an article about the haunting of Elsewhere. Out of the entire group it is him that reacts the strongest to the paranormal events that go on at Elsewhere. A catholic that has renounced his faith, Gabriel suggest this is why Terrence was the one who saw the priests at Elsewhere.
Anna Trawley- A psychic that gained her powers in a car accident that killed her daughter, she is very much aware of the haunting of Elsewhere. While there she keeps a journal of the events that go on there, and many of the events are ones the others are not aware of.
Gabriel Case- Although he passes himself off as a paranormal investigator for much of the book, he is actually the ghost of the doctor that murdered his wife and haunted Elsewhere. He was tasked with watching over the group until they became aware they were trapped in a seemingly endless cycle.

Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipeline

The Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipeline is a natural gas pipeline in Russia, transporting Sakhalin's gas to the most populated and industrialized regions of the Russian Far East (Khabarovsk Krai and Primorsky Krai). It is also projected to become a part of an international export route, carrying Russian gas to East Asian countries, such as the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Japan. The pipeline is owned and operated by Gazprom. It was opened on 8 September 2011.
History.
The project was announced in September 2007, when the Russian Federation's Industry and Energy Ministry approved the gas Development Program for Eastern Siberia and the Far East. It was aimed at reducing utility prices in the Russian Far East by replacing more expensive coal and petroleum at the regional power and heating plants with cheaper natural gas.
The pipeline project was approved by Gazprom's board of directors on 23 July 2008. At the same meeting, Gazprom's board of directors agreed to purchase the Komsomolsk–Khabarovsk pipeline, commissioned in November 2006 by Daltransgaz, a former subsidiary of Rosneft. Design and exploration work was completed in November 2008 and working documentation was prepared by April 2009.
Construction began on 31 July 2009 in Khabarovsk with a ceremony, which was attended by the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The pipeline was opened on 8 September 2011. The opening ceremony on Russky Island was again attended by Prime Minister Putin.
The first gas consumer in the Primorsky Krai was Vladivostok Combined Heat and Power Plant 2 (CHPP-2), tasked with converting from coal to natural gas. In early 2012, CHPP-1 and the heating plant in Severnaya will be converted to natural gas.
Route.
The Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok gas transport system consists of three sections. The Khabarovsk–Vladivostok section together with the first phase of the Sakhalin–Komsomolsk section, which supplies gas from the Gazprom's Far East northern part's gas fields, will create a pipeline system. The third section - the Komsomolsk–Habarovsk pipeline, commissioned in 2006- would then be connected to the proposed Yakutia–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipeline.
In Primorsky Krai, the pipeline will feed a planned LNG plant, producing liquefied natural gas for export to Japan, and a proposed petrochemical complex. There are also plans to supply gas from Vladivostok to Japan and South Korea by subsea pipelines. An alternative route to South Korea would be via an overland pipeline through North Korea. According to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, this proposed pipeline would help strengthen security in East Asia by meeting North Korea's energy needs and providing it with transit revenue. The project was also discussed during the visit of Kim Jong Il to Russia in August 2011.
Technical description.
The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas per year during the first stage, rising to by 2020, of which would be supplied from Sakhalin. It is expected to cost US$21–24 billion.
The diameter of the Sakhalin–Komsomolsk and Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipelines is , with a working pressure of . The diameter of the Komsomolsk–Khabarovsk pipeline is .
In addition to the three pipelines, the Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok system consists of the Sakhalin main compressor station, a gas distribution station in Vladivostok, a power supply, telemechanics, communications systems and access roads.
Supply source.
The pipeline is fed from the Sakhalin-III project with additional gas provided from the Sakhalin-II project. The main supply source is the Gazprom-owned Kirinskoye field.
Owner.
The pipeline project was developed by Gazprom Invest Vostok, a subsidiary of Gazprom. The pipeline is operated by Gazprom.

Ostendorff joined the Army on 5 November 1925. Assigned to the 1st Prussian Infantry Regiment, he remained with the unit for his entire Army service.
Appointed an officer candidate on 1 April 1926, he was promoted to Gefreiter on 1 August 1927, to Unteroffizier on 1 October 1927, to Fähnrich on 1 August 1928 and to Oberfähnrich on 1 August 1929. A month after being commissioned, Ostendorff was given a platoon command in the II. Bataillon. From mid-November 1933 to the start of the following March he helped form the SA military training school at Gudwallen. He transferred to the Luftwaffe on 1 March 1934. Trained as an observer and pilot, Ostendorff served with the "Fliegertruppe Jüterbog" as a tactical instructor, and head of the photographic interpretation section until the start of October 1935.
Moving to the SS-Verfügungstruppe, he taught classes at "Junkerschule Bad Tölz" until 1 April 1938. Ostendorff then transferred to the new "SS-Standarte 3 "Der Führer"" and led the "4. Sturm" of the "I. Sturmbann" until 1 June 1939. He next transferred to form and lead the "SS-Flugabwehr-Maschinengewehr-Abteilung", officially until 10 October 1939.
With the forming of the first SS division on 10 October 1939, that became ""Das Reich"", he left command of the anti-aircraft unit to Jakob Fick, was selected as the first divisional "Ia" (Chief of Staff) by Paul Hausser and officially held the post until June 1942. Ostendorff won the Knight's Cross on 13 September 1941 for leading a counter-attack against the village of Ushakovo in the vicinity of Smolensk which dominated the highly important Yelnya-Dorogobuzh road. The village was recaptured and the danger of a Russian breakthrough was eliminated.
He then led "Kampfgruppe "Das Reich"" in Russia from February to June 1942, during which Siegfried Max Schultz assumed the "Ia" post duties with those elements being refitted in France. His performance with Kampfgruppe "Das Reich" won him the German Cross in Gold.
When Paul Hausser formed the initial SS corps in June 1942, he selected Ostendorff as his Chief of Staff. He officially held the post with "SS-Generalkommando" (later II. SS-Panzerkorps) until 22 November 1943, when succeeded by Rüdiger Pipkorn. Promoted to "Oberführer" for his actions at Kharkov, he was next given a divisional command.
Ostendorff was assigned command of the 17. SS-Panzer-Grenadier-Division "Götz von Berlichingen", officially effective 1 November 1943. However, he remained with his corps post into the third week of November. Delays in the raising of the division lasted until early January 1944 when he actually assumed command from Otto Binge who had led the formation staff. During the fighting in Normandy, Ostendorff was badly wounded near Carentan on 16 June 1944 when he was hit in the shoulder by machine gun-fire. Divisional command then passed again to Otto Binge.
Resuming command from then temporary commander Gustav Mertsch on 21 October 1944, he remained as leader of ""Götz von Berlichingen"" until transferred again in late November 1944. Temporary divisional command passed to Hans Lingner but Ostendorff officially retained full commander status until early December.
Ostendorff was next promoted to Gruppenführer on 1 December 1944 and became the only Chief of Staff for Heinrich Himmler's "Heeresgruppe "Oberrhein"" from 2 December 1944 to 22 January 1945. His final posting was to ""Das Reich"" as divisional commander. He succeeded temporary commander Karl Kreutz officially on 10 February 1945, and led the division until grievously wounded by an incendiary shell on 9 March 1945 in the vicinity of Székesfehérvár during fighting in Hungary.
Rudolf Lehmann assumed command of ""Das Reich"". Werner Ostendorff died at a field hospital in Bad Aussee from gas gangrene on 1 May 1945, the same day Berlin fell to the Russians.
Personal life.
Werner Ostendorff was a son of the Prussian "Regierungsvizepräsident" Ernst Ostendorff. Married in October 1935, he and his wife had two sons and a daughter.

Livne

Shani-Livne (, "lit." Birch), (, "lit." Scarlet) is a communal Israeli settlement in the southern Judaean Mountains of the West Bank, though some of the village is over the Green Line and therefore in Israel proper. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
History.
Shani-Livne was established in 1982. It is located on the outskirts of Yatir Forest. Located to the south of Hebron, it falls under the jurisdiction of Har Hebron Regional Council. The residents moved into permanent housing in 1989. The community was renamed Shani in memory of Shani Shacham, the son of former members killed in the line of duty.
In 2006, Shani-Livne had a population of 416.

Genetic correlation

Genetic correlation is the proportion of variance that two traits share due to genetic causes. Outside the theoretical boundary case of traits with zero heritability (the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences), the genetic correlation of traits is independent of their heritability: i.e., two traits can have a very high genetic correlation even when the heritability of each is low and vice versa.
The genetic correlation, then, tells us how much of the genetic influence on two traits is common to both: if it is above zero, this suggests that the two traits are influenced by common genes. This can be an important constraint on conceptualizations of the two traits: traits which seem different phenotypically but which share a common genetic basis require an explanation for how these genes can influence both traits.
For example, consider two traits - dark skin and black hair. These two traits may individually have a very high heritability (most of the population-level variation in the trait due to genetic differences, or in simpler terms, genetics contributes significantly to these two traits), however, they may still have a very low genetic correlation if, for instance, these two traits were being controlled by different, non-overlapping, non-linked genetic loci.
Computing the genetic correlation.
Estimates of a genetic correlation obviously require a genetically informative sample, such as a twin study.
Given a genetic covariance matrix, the genetic correlation is computed by standardizing this, i.e., by converting the covariance matrix to a correlation matrix. For example, if two traits, say height and weight have the following additive genetic variance-covariance matrix:
Then the genetic correlation is .55, as seen is the standardized matrix below:
In practice, structural equation modeling applications such as OpenMx are used to calculate both the genetic covariance matrix and its standardized form. In R, cov2cor() will standardize the matrix.
Typically, published reports will provide genetic variance components that have been standardized as a proportion of total variance (for instance in an ACE twin study model standardised as a proportion of V-total = A+C+E). In this case, the metric for computing the genetic covariance (the variance within the genetic covariance matrix) is lost (because of the standardizing process), so you cannot readily estimate the genetic correlation of two traits from such published models. Multivariate models (such as the Cholesky decomposition) will, however, allow the viewer to see shared genetic effects (as opposed to the genetic correlation) by following path rules. it is important therefore to provide the unstandardised path coefficients in publications.

Marian Bublewicz

Marian Bublewicz (August 25, 1950 – 20 February 1993) was Polish rally and racing driver of 80s born in Olsztyn, the home of Rally Poland. Including the triumph classes, Marian Bublewicz won the Polish Rally Championship 20 times.
Career.
He trained a lot, often in the forests near Olsztyn and this is what distinguished him from his rivals. He also financed his passion himself managing a car service garage where, in 1993, he employed 50 people.
Marian Bublewicz at the beginning of his career was a motocross driver, but a terrible accident destroyed his plans. He switched to driving a rally car. Marian Bublewicz became an icon of Polish sport.
In the 1980s Marian Bublewicz fought with Andrzej Koper. Their great rivalry forced them to import new sports cars from outside the Eastern Bloc. In this way raising the level of Polish rallies.
In 1983 Marian Bublewicz became a driver of official FSO Rally Team, using such cars as Polonez 2000 Rally and Polonez 2000 Turbo. Marian was very hard-working and had a habit of spending as much time on training as he could so OBRSO (FSO Development Division) constructed special Polonez training car based on 3 door body with fiberglass parts like in 2000 Turbo but with much cheaper, modified 1.5 OHV engine and smaller dog-cluth gearbox instead of 2.0 DOHC turbocharged engine with more expensive transmission.
In 1987 Bublewicz won Polish Championship behind the wheel of Polonez 2000 Rally and it was the last time when this car was used by FSO Rally Team. Since 1988 Bublewicz changed make and started using private Mazda 323 4WD because A group Polonez 1.5C Turbo was not competitive enough.
In 1991, he was the first in Poland who created a professional team – Marlboro Rally Team Poland.
In 1992 Bublewicz was the vice–champion of European Rally Championship and received the prize from Max Mosley's hands.
Death.
In 1993 his name was included in the priority list "A" – published by The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile. Bublewicz wanted to win another title, so he bought a factory Ford Escort Cosworth. His new car was not ready to start in the first rally, so he rented the Patrick Snijers's Ford Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4 from ERC.
Bublewicz started in the Winter Rally Lower Silesian as the number 1. He had won this rally seven times. During the rally, 2 km from the start of the 5th special stage of Orłowiec – Złoty Stok, on 20 February 1993 his car came off the road at a right hand corner, he struck a tree. The car wrapped around a tree and the safety cage failed it pierced him, but he remained conscious. Severely injured, Marian Bublewicz, was pulled out of the crashed car by fans and volunteer firemen. Marian Bublewicz died in hospital the same day in Lądek Zdrój.
Bublewicz in an interview said:
"Many admirable rally drivers died, but I consider it as a mischance that can be quite quickly suffered by the loss of life in such discipline. It is a great tragedy when a man dies in sport competition."
Aftermath.
His death provoked a number of changes in safety and organisation standards on the rally special stages in Poland. Since 1994 season 10th winter Lower Silesian Rally is called "The Memorial of Marian Bublewicz".
In a poll held by the monthly newspaper "Auto Moto i Sport" in 2000, Marian Bublewicz was named 'The Best Polish Rally Driver of the 20th Century'.
The tree which Bublewicz's car drove into was later cut down and made into a cross. There has also been set a commemorative stone in that place.

1955 British Lions tour to South Africa

In 1955 the British Lions rugby union team toured Southern and Eastern Africa. The Lions drew the test series against , each team winning two of the four matches. They won the first test by a single point and the third by three points and lost the second and fourth matches by wider margins. As well as South Africa, the tour included a match against South West Africa (later to become ), two games against Rhodesia (later to become Zimbabwe) and one versus East Africa.
Overall the tourists played twenty-five matches winning nineteen, losing five and drawing one. The Lions lost their opening fixture against Western Transvaal and were also beaten by Eastern Province and Border later in the tour. They drew with Eastern Transvaal.
It was the Lions' second tour after World War II and the first to South Africa after that war.
The touring party was captained by Robin Thompson of Ireland. The manager was Jack A. E. Siggins and the assistant manager was D. E. Davies.
Jack Siggins had the honour of being invited, by the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA), officially to open the newly constructed RFUEA Ground at Ngong Road in Nairobi just prior to the Lions last match of that tour against East Africa.
Squad.
The Idi Amin myth.
There is a frequently repeated urban legend that that Idi Amin (later to become the infamous military dictator of Uganda) was selected as a replacement by East Africa for their match against the 1955 British Lions. The story is entirely unfounded, he does not appear on the team photograph or on the official team list and replacements were not allowed in international rugby until 13 years after this event is supposed to have taken place.

Donald Agnew

Brigadier-General Donald Robert Agnew, CB, CBE, CD, ADC (born October 25, 1897, date of death unknown) was a Canadian General and educator.
Family.
Agnew was born in Toronto on October 25, 1897 to Major John Agnew and Daisy Edith Stocks. Following the death of Daisy Edith Stocks in 1902, Major John Agnew married Elizabeth Dickenson, of Toronto.
Major John Agnew, 127th Battalion, Canadian Infantry, served overseas in World War I, along with his three sons, Lt. Donald Agnew, of the Canadian Reserve Artillery, Lt. Ellis Agnew, 351 Brigade R.F.A., and Lt. Ronald Agnew, of the Royal Canadian Navy. While her husband and sons were overseas during the war, Mrs. Elizabeth Agnew moved temporarily to Hamilton, Ont.
Agnew did not receive a CB (Companion of the Order of the Bath). No Canadian Brigadiers received a CB in WWII. If you look him up in the London Gazette, you will not find a CB.
Education.
Agnew was educated at the University of Toronto Schools. He studied at the RMC, student # 1137 in 1915.
Career.
He returned to RMC in Kingston as Commandant and ADC to the Governor-General (1947–54). At the time, RMC was the only military college with a four year course, the course was 15 percent military content. During this period, the New One Hundred Opening Ceremonies were held (20 September 1948). He devised a new system of organization at RMC consisting of a vice-commandant as director of studies, to coordinate the military and academic training at RMC and to represent RMC at the National Conference of Canadian Universities as the equivalent of a vce-principal. The commandant personally commanded the cadet battalion. A staff-adjutant issued the routine orders.
He presided over the New One Hundred Opening Ceremonies at the RMC on 20 September 1948. He inaugurated the Old Brigade, for alumni celebrating 50 years since they entered one of the Canadian Royal Military Colleges in 1950. He was photographed as Commandant of RMC when Queen Elizabeth II, who was known as Princess Elizabeth before her accession, and Prince Philip visited on 12 October 1951.

Beau Jack

Sidney Walker, better known as Beau Jack, (April 1, 1921 – February 9, 2000), was an American lightweight boxer, he was a world champion twice. One of the most popular fighters during the war years, he headlined at Madison Square Garden on 21 occasions, a record that still stands.
Early years.
He was born in Augusta, Georgia and was raised by his maternal grandmother, who gave him the nickname "Beau Jack", following the death of his mother. From an early age Jack worked as a shoe-shine boy in Augusta, when he was 15 he looked to supplement his income by participating in the brutal battles royal. These fights featured six black men fighting blindfolded until one remained, these fights were funded by rich white men for their own entertainment, the winner received a relatively meagre purse. Despite his small stature Jack was often victorious.
Following his first battle royal at the Augusta National Golf Club Jack became a caddie at the club. He quickly befriended some of the club's members, including the golfing legend Bobby Jones, who helped fund his boxing training.
Boxing career.
Jack turned professional in 1940, he began his career fighting in Massachusetts where he quickly established an impressive record of 27-4-2. It was also during these early fights that Jack earned his reputation for being a relentless and powerful fighter, two traits which endeared him to audiences. 
To further his career Jack moved to New York in August 1941, where he continued to impress under the management of Chick Wergeles. By November 1942 Jack found himself in a fight against Allie Stolz to decide who would challenge for the New York version of the world title. Going into the fight Stolz was the clear favourite, he was 3-1 to win, however Jack pulled off a massive shock by knocking out Stolz in the seventh round. In the title fight, against Tippy Larkin, Jack pulled off a similar surprise by knocking out the champion in the third round.
Jack only held the title for six months before dropping it to fellow hall-of-famer Bob Montgomery on a unanimous points decision. Jack did go on to regain the title from Montgomery, before losing it to Juan Zurita in March 1944.
The most famous fight of Jack's career was his fourth battle with Montgomery on August 4, 1944, the so-called "War Bonds Fight" for which tickets were only available to those who purchased war bonds. Although Montgomery's title was not on the line, the gate was a record $36m with 15,822 war bonds being sold. Many people who purchased bonds left their tickets at the box office for US servicemen, indeed Montgomery and Jack, who were both serving as privates in the US Army, refused to take purses for the fight. Jack took the fight on points after 10 rounds, however the highlight of the evening was when the lights dimmed and a spotlight picked out Joe Louis, who was standing in the front row, to the reception of a standing ovation.
Jack would not challenge for the title again until July 12, 1948 when he fought another hall-of-famer: Ike Williams. This challenge proved to be unsuccessful as Jack was knocked out in the sixth round. This defeat marked the start of a rivalry between the pair who would go on to fight on three more occasions. However, with Jack's skills clearly waning, Williams managed to take the first match by a split decision, the second match was drawn, and Williams won the third as Jack was unable to answer the bell for the ninth round. This third fight, on August 12, 1958, also marked the end of Jack's career.
Life after boxing.
Immediately after his career Jack operated a drive-in barbecue stand, ran a small farm, and refereed wrestling matches. However, when his earnings ran out he returned to shining shoes at the Fontainebleau, a hotel in Miami Florida. Jack also campaigned heavily for a pension scheme for boxers, he felt that no fighter should be reduced to the impoverished fate he was. He also trained fighters in Miami Beach at the Fifth Street Gym.
Beau Jack had seven children. Ronald, Donald, George, Barbara Ann, Yvonne, Georgiana, Tim. His wife was named Josephine. None of the sons became boxers. (information came directly from George Walker, 4/18/2007)
In his later years Jack suffered from diabetes, complications from which ultimately killed him.
Beau Jack was the 1944 Ring Magazine fighter of the year and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.

<doc id="18690894" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18690894" title="Susya">
Susya

Susya (, ) is the site of an ancient Jewish village in the southern Judaean Mountains of the West Bank, a Palestinian village established in the 1830s and a religious communal Israeli settlement under the jurisdiction of Har Hebron Regional Council established in 1983.
The Israeli settlement was established between May and September 1983 on 1,800 dunams of land. It had a population of 737 in 2006.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
History.
Susya, whether it refers to the site of the synagogue or the ruins of the contiguous ancient and large settlement of some 60 dunams, is not mentioned in any ancient text, and Jewish literature failed to register an ancient Jewish town on that site. It is thought by some to correspond to the Biblical Carmel (Josh 15.5), a proposal made by Avraham Negev. Others argue that, in the wake of the Second Revolt (AD 132-5), when the Romans garrisoned Khirbet el-Karmil, identified as the biblical Carmel, religious Jews uncomfortable with pagan symbols moved 2 km south-west to the present Susya, which they perhaps already farmed, and that, while they still regarded their new community as Carmel, the name was lost when the village's fortunes declined in the early Arab period, perhaps because the new Muslim overlords would not have tolerated its economy, which was based on wine.
The site, in Arabic "Khirbet Susiya/Susiyeh", "Ruin of the Liquorice Plant" was first described by V. Guérin in 1869, who first recognized its importance. The spelling Susya represents the Hebrew name, as determined by the Israeli Naming committee. In the Survey of Western Palestine, based on an observation in 1875 on the area of the southeastern slope of a hill west of Susya, Charles Warren and Claude Conder labeled Susya as an 'Important public structure'. German accounts later stated that it was a remnant of an ancient church. In 1937, the building to the north was identified by L. A. Meyer and A. Reifenberg as the site of a synagogue.
Ancient synagogue.
The site was examined by Shemarya Gutman in 1969, who uncovered it during a trial dig the narthex of a synagogue. He, together with Ze'ev Yeivin and Ehud Netzer, then conducted the Israeli excavations at Khirbet Suseya, (subsequently named by a Hebrew calque as Horvat Susya) over 1971-1972, by the Palestinian village of Susiya Al-Qadime. 
Such remains are intriguing because so far no excavations have uncovered undisputed evidence for synagogues before the 2nd century CE in Judea. The excavated synagogue dates from the 4th to the 7th century CE and was in continuous use until the 9th century CE. It is one of four of an architecturally unique group in the Southern Judean Hills, of the six synagogues identified in Judea as a whole, the lower number probably reflecting a shift in the Jewish population from Judah to Galilee in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The other three of this distinctive group are those of Eshtemoa, Horvat Maon, and 'Anim. Three outstanding characteristics of the Susya-Eshtemoa group, group are their width, entrances at the short eastern wall, and the absence of columns to support the roof 
According to David Amit, the architectural design, particularly the eastern entrance and axis of prayer, which differ from the majority of Galilean synagogues, exhibits the ramifications of the earliest halakhic law conserved in southern Judea for generations after the destruction of the Temple. This was forgotten in Galilee, but in Judea there was a closer adherence to older traditions reflecting closer proximity to Jerusalem. The eastern orientation may be also related to the idea of dissuading heretics and Christians in the same area, who bowed to the east, in the belief that the Shekinah lay in that direction. 
The synagogue was built as a broadhouse, rather than along basilica lines, measuring 9 by 16 metres (27 by 48 feet built in well-wrought ashlar construction, with triple doorway façade in an eastward orientation, and the bema and niche at the centre of the northern wall. There was a secondary bema in the eastern section. Unlike other synagogues in Judea this had a gallery, made while reinforcing the western wall. East of the synagogue was an open courtyard surrounded on three sides by a roofed portico. The western side opened to the synagogue’s narthex, and floor of narthex composed of coloured mosaics set in an interlaced pattern. This model was of short duration, yielding in the late Byzantine phase (6th/7th) to the basilica form, already elsewhere dominant in synagogue architecture.
In contrast to most Galilean synagogues with their façade and Torah shrine on the same Jerusalem-oriented wall, the Judean synagogue at Susya, (as well as Esthtemoa and Maon) has the niche on the northern Jerusalem-oriented wall and entrances on the east side wall. The synagogue floor of white tesserae has three mosaic panels, the eastern one a Torah Shrine, two menorahs, one on a screen relief showing two lamps suspended from a bar between the menorah’s upper branches, perhaps, since the Torah shrine flanked by lampstands, symbolizing both a connection between the synagogue and the Temple for spotlighting the bema and giving light for scriptural readings, were by the reverse mirroring of the menorah pattern in the mosaics, heightened the central significance of the Torah shrine in the hall a "lulav", and an "etrog" with columns on each side. Next to the columns is a landscape with deers ands rams. The central panel composed of geometric and floral patterns. A spoke-wheel design before the central bema, has led Gutman to believed it is the remnant of a zodiac wheel. Zodiac mosaics are important witness to the time, since they were systematically suppressed by the Church, and, their frequent construction in Palestinian synagogue floors may be an index of 'the "inculturation" of non-Jewish imagery and its resulting Judaization'. The fragmentary state of the wheel mosaic is due to its replacement by a much cruder geometric pavement pattern, indicative of a desire to erase what later came to be thought of as objectionable imagery.
A motif that probably represented Daniel in the lion's den, as in the mosaics discovered at Naaran near Jericho and Ein Samsam in the Golan was also tesselated, surviving only most fragmentarily. The figure, in an "orans" stance, flanked by lions, was scrubbed from the mosaics in line with later trends, in what Fine calls a ‘new aesthetic’ at Khirbet Susiya, one that refurbished the designs to suppress iconographic forms thought by later generations to be objectionable. We can only reconstruct the allusion to Daniel from the remaining final Hebrew letters remaining, namely -el, .
Another unique feature is number of inscriptions. Four were laid in mosaics: two in Hebrew, attesting perhaps to its conservation as a spoken language in this region and two in Aramaic. Nineteen fragmentary inscriptions, some of which were in Greek, were etched into the marble of the building. From these dedicatory inscriptions the impression is given that the synagogue was run by donors rather than by priests (kōhen).
The abandoned synagogue, or its atrium or courtyard, was converted into a mosque around the 10th century. A niche on the northern wall used as a mihrab/mahrab dates to Saladin's time, according to local tradition. In the 12th–13th centuries Crusaders garrisoned at nearby Chermala and Eshtemoa, and, in their wake, a few families, moved into the ruins to exploit the rich agricultural land. 
The settlement on the hill contiguous to the synagogue seems to have once had a thriving economy. A fine store has been excavated from its ruins. It seems to have undergone a decline in the second half of the 4th century, and again in the 6th century. Some speak of abandonment though the evidence from the synagogue suggests continuity into the medieval period.
Modern era: local population, Israeli settlement and conflict.
Palestinian Susya, called "Susya al-Qadima" ('Old Susya') dating back to 1832, was a village constituted of permanent cave homes. The Israeli settlement, which as of 2006 has a population of 737, was established between May and September 1983, on 1,800 dunams of land. In 1986, Israel expropriated part of the village's residential ground for an 'archeological park', evicting several villagers from their homes. They moved to nearby land they owned to restart their lives. According to David Shulman, the number of Palestinians of Susya affected by the 1986 expulsion was over 1,500 people, and they resettled nearby on land they owned at a site called "Rujum al-Hamri", near the new Israeli settlement at Susya. For some decades they were subject, Shulman states, to many violent attacks, and settler recourse to both civil and military courts, to drive them out.
Since then the local villages, like Palestinian Susya, have been losing land, and being cut off from each other, as the nearby settlements of Carmel, Maon, Susya and Beit Yatir began to be built and developed, and illegal outposts established. The second expulsion took place in 1990, when Rujum al-Hamri was evacuated by the army, and the inhabitants loaded onto trucks and dumped on a roadside at the edge of a desert. Most returned and rebuilt on a rocky escarpment within their traditional agricultural and grazing territory.Their wells taken, they were forced to buy water from nearby Yatta. Since 2000 Jewish settlers in Susiya have denied Palestinians access to 10 cisterns in the area, and try to block their access to others. Soil at Susiya, with a market value of NIS 2,000 per truckload, is also taken from lands belonging to the village of Yatta.
The third expulsion occurred in June 2001, when settler civilians and soldiers drove the Palestinians of Susya out, destroying their tents and caves, blocking their cisterns, killing their livestock and digging up their agricultural land. The settlers established a "Dahlia Farm" in the same year, and an outpost was set up on the archeological site. On Sept 26 of the same year, by an order of the Israeli Supreme Court, these structures were ordered to be destroyed and the land returned to the Palestinians. Settlers and the IDF prevented the villagers from reclaiming their land, some 750 acres. The villagers made an appeal to the same court to be allowed to reclaim their lands and live without harassment. Some 93 events of settler violence were listed. The settlers made a counter-appeal, and one family that had managed to return to its land suffered a third eviction.
Land next to the Palestinian village of Susya was confiscated from the village of Yatta, from which a dozen local families had been expelled to make way on the pretext of archeological digs, according to one source. A major expansion of the new settlement began on 18 September 1999, when its boundaries expanded northwards and eastwards, with the Palestinian Shreiteh family allegedly losing roughly 150 more dunams.
The Palestinians that remain in the area live in tents on a small rocky hill between the settlement and the archeological park which is located within walking distance. According to Amnesty International, ten caves inhabited by Susya Palestinian families were blown up by the IDF in 1996, and some 113 tents were destroyed in 1998. Amnesty International also reports that official documents asking them to leave the area address them generically as 'intruders' ("polesh"/intruder). Most of the rain-catching water cisterns used by the local Palestinian farmers of Susya were demolished by the Israeli army in 1999 and 2001. A local Susya resident told Amnesty International,'Water is life ; without water we can’t live; not us, not the animals, or the plants. Before we had some water, but after the army destroyed everything we have to bring water from far away ; it’s very difficult and expensive. They make our life very difficult, to make us leave.'
On 7 June 1991 a settler from the Israeli settlement of Susya shot dead a local Palestinian shepherd, under circumstances that were never clarified. On 23 March 1993, Musa Suliman Abu Sabha a Palestinian was arrested outside Susiya by two guards, Moshe Deutsch and Yair Har-Sinai, either on suspicion he had stolen 60 sheep from the latter's flock, or because they suspected he was planning an attack on Jews. Taken for questioning, he stabbed in the shoulder or back one of the guards, Moshe Deutsch, while the two were in a car, and, wrestled to the ground, was bound hand and foot. Another settler from nearby Maal Hever, Yoram Shkolnik shot him eight times, killing him. According to the IDF he was found bearing a grenade. Reports differ as to whether he still had the grenade when bound, or whether it had been taken from him after his arrest. In 2001, Yair Har-Sinai was killed in a brawl with local Palestinians. A Palestinian, Jihad Najar, was convicted of murder and received a sentence of life imprisonment. The IDF then evicted the 300 Palestinians in the area, demolishing some of their makeshift homes. They have sought redress in an Israeli court. Jewish residents of Susya have harassed local Palestinians, destroyed their property, and hindered them from gathering their crops from olive groves. In 2009 Yaakov Teitel, was indicted for the 2007 murder of a Palestinian shepherd from Susya.
While the Israeli settlement has mains power and piped water from Israel, the Palestinians depend on solar panels and wind turbine energy made possible by a Palestinian/Israeli NGO – Comet - and on wells. This project has been shortlisted for the BBC World Challenge which highlighted the involvement of two Israeli physicists, Elad Orian and Noam Dotan. According to David Hirst, the inhabitants of al-Amniyr, at-Tuwani and the other villages that comprise Susiya, are faced with a catch-22. If they comply with the law they cannot build cisterns and collect even the rainwater. But if they fail to work their lands, they lose it anyway. One small enclave that remains for a Bedouin pastoralist's family suffers from further encroachment, with one settler, according to David Shulman, managing to wrest 95% of the family's land, and still intent on entering the remainder.
In a ruling delivered in December 2013, the Israel High Court of Justice accepted that Yatta Palestinians had shown their legal attachment to a stretch of land between Susya and the illegal settlement of Mitzpe Yair, but requested them to withdraw their petition against the settlers who are alleged to have illegally seized these lands. The subject of a petition concerns 300 dunams of agricultural land, and a further 900 dunams of pasture of which, the Palestinians argue, they were forced by violent attacks from using for agriculture and herding. The court held that the proper option open to the Palestinians was recourse to a civil legal action.
Demolition Orders.
Palestinian Susya has been razed 5 times, in 1985, 1991, 1997 and twice in 2001. Since it is classified within Area C of the West Bank, it lies under Israeli military occupation and control. Though they own much of the land, Susya's residents are denied permits to build structures, and therefore build without permission from Israeli authorities. No master plan exists for the Palestinian Susya as opposed to the Israeli settlement of Susya, and Palestinians are required to obtain permits from the Israeli Civil Administration.
On November 24, 2011 bulldozers razed two tents where the Mughnem family dwells on their own land in Susya.
The Jewish settlers of Susya and the Israeli pro-settler association NGO Regavim petitioned the High Court to demolish Palestinian Susya, defining the villagers as 'trespassers' living in 'illegal outposts', terms usually applied to illegal Jewish outposts on the West Bank.
On June 14 an Israelli court issued 6 demolition orders covering 50 buildings including tent dwellings, ramshackle huts, sheep pens, latrines, water cisterns, a wind-and-sun powered turbine, and the German-funded solar panels in most of the Palestinian village of Susya.
Over 500 people from Tel Aviv, Beer Sheva, and Jerusalem came to mount a peaceful protest on June 22.
Before fifteen senior EU diplomats visiting the area on 8 August 2012, Susya villager Nasser Nawaja'a complained that "(t)here are in this village octogenarians who are older than the State of Israel . . . How can they be told that their residence here is illegal?" The EU has declared it does not expect that the demolition order will be executed.
On the 26th of June, 2013, the Israeli Civil Administration, a military body, raided Palestinian Susya and handed out 40 demolition orders for many structures, tents, hothouses, a water well and a solar panel, established on humanitarian grounds by the European Union. Nearby Israeli settlers built two additional and unauthorized houses in the Mitzpeh Avigayil outpost, without interference.
A local Palestinian declared to the Hebrew press:
They’re calling our village an illegal outpost. These lands are ours from before there was a State of Israel. My father is older than your state—and I am an illegal alien on my own land. I ask where is justice? Your courts distinguish between the settler and the Palestinian…We’re surrounded by illegal outposts by settlers that have everything—infrastructures of water and electricity— despite the fact that these settlements are illegal even under Israeli law. And now you want to expel this old man from his home once again? To expel all of us who own these lands, who have lived on them for generations in this space that is ours, which is all we know?
On 24 August, a further demolition took place. On 29 August 2012 the IDF destroyed a sheepfold and two tents, one a dwelling and the other for storage, donated to villagers of Palestinian Susiya by the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Honorable Mention

The Honorable Mention was an important Military awards and decorations of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for those who distinguished themselves by acts of high bravery, but weren't eligible yet for the highest accolade of the Military William Order. The Honorable Mention was in fact not a medal but a mention in the proclamation of the Dutch army, to honor the soldier.
Since the mention was important in the process to be made an actual knight of the Military William Order, the Honorable Mentions were registered in the chapter of the Military William Order.
In the first instance no decoration was associated with this Honorable Mention, although unofficially soldiers used a small decorative metal wreath worn above their other decorations and medals. These decorative wreaths are primarily known to be used during the Ten days campaign (August 2 – August 12, 1831) and the Java War (1825-1830).
In 1877 King William III decided by royal decree that soldiers with an Honorable Mention were allowed to wear a silver crown on the ribbon or ribbon bar of the Dutch "Decoration for Important Military Acts" as decoration, together with a Roman numeral in case of multiple mentions. Hundreds of soldiers in the former Netherlands East Indies were awarded with these Honorable Mentions. 
Shortly before the start of the Second World War the law regarding the Military William Order was reorganized, and as result that the Honorable Mention was abolished. Although the mention didn't have an official status anymore since then, on the ribbon or ribbon bars of the Bronze Cross or the Airman's Cross still a decorative crown for Honorable Mention was worn, however now in gold.
With the royal decree on 30 March 1944 Queen Wilhemina created the Bronze Lion as high bravery award and finally replaced the Honorable Mention.

The National Sun Party (Indonesian"Partai Matahari Bangsa") is a political party in Indonesia. It contested the 2009 elections.
The party was established by activists from the National Mandate Party (PAN) who were frustrated at the way their path to the leadership was blocked by the older generation. The party was founded by members of the Muhammadiyah, and some senior party members still belong to the organization, as do 75% of party members. The party hopes that younger people will assume leadership of Indonesia in 2014. It set a target of 30 seats in the 2009 legislative election, but won only 0.4 percent of the vote, less than the 2.5 percent electoral threshold, meaning it was awarded no seats in the People's Representative Council.

USS Aloe (AN-6)

USS "Aloe" (AN-6/YN-1) was an which was assigned to serve U.S. Navy ships and harbors during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Washington.
"Aloe" (YN-1) was laid down on 14 October 1940 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard; launched on 11 January 1941; and placed "in service" on 11 June 1941, Lt. (j.g.) Harry R. Shawk, USNR, in charge.
World War II service.
Allocated to the 12th Naval District, the net tender operated in a non-commissioned status in the San Francisco, area from the summer of 1941 to the winter of 1942, tending and laying the antisubmarine nets and booms protecting the waters of that important region.
Assigned to the South Pacific.
Commissioned on 30 December 1942, Lt. Donald B. Howard, USNR, in command, "Aloe" departed San Francisco on 22 January 1943, bound for Pearl Harbor. Routed thence to New Caledonia, she reached Noumea on 18 March. Six days later, she got underway and proceeded via the New Hebrides, to the Solomon Islands.
The net tender spent the remainder of the war in the Pacific Ocean, laying and tending torpedo nets and buoys, and conducting various salvage and towing operations. She ranged from New Caledonia to Okinawa and included the Solomon Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Palau Islands in her itinerary. During this time, she was reclassified as a net layer, on 31 January 1944, her hull number becoming "AN-6" on that date.
While perhaps pedestrian, "Aloe's" duties were, nevertheless, vital and certainly not without hazard, as was dramatically demonstrated soon after she arrived in the Solomons in the spring of 1943.
Under attack at Tulagi.
On 7 April of that year, she lay moored to the Sturgis Dock, Tulagi, when 67 "Vals" (Aichi D3A2 dive bombers), escorted by 110 "Zero" fighters—all but a very few of which had been drawn from the complements of four Japanese aircraft carriers—arrived to attack the shipping in the harbor there. The raid was a part of Admiral Yamamoto's Operation "I"—a series of massive air attacks aimed at American positions in the Solomons. Obviously interested in bigger game, the Japanese planes left "Aloe" alone, sinking destroyer and an oiler and damaging a second oiler and cargo ship. Nevertheless, the net tender, with her solitary 3-inch gun and her four .50-caliber machine guns, contributed to the antiaircraft barrage that helped to drive the attackers off, claiming one "Val" shot down, another "possibly" splashed, and a third "damaged."
Shooting down enemy planes in the Marianas.
A little over a year later, "Aloe" next encountered the enemy during Operation "Forager" – the occupation of the Marianas. While in Task Group (TG) 53.16 on 18 June 1944, the net-layer was cruising east of Guam when Japanese planes attacked at 17:59. Utilizing local control and observing excellent fire discipline, "Aloe's" 20-milhmeter and .50-caliber batteries scored hits on three enemy planes. Two of these Japanese aircraft crashed and the third departed the area in flames.
Her last action with enemy planes came on 28 May 1945, while she was anchored in Nakagusuku Wan, Okinawa, serving as part of Net and Buoy Unit 3 (Task Unit 32.8.3). During that morning, she took a suicider under fire with all her guns as the kamikaze made a dive on the anchorage.
Damaged in a typhoon.
War's end in August 1945, found "Aloe" still at Okinawa. While her battle with the Japanese may have been over, there were still the "elements" with which to contend. On 9 October 1945, a typhoon swept across Okinawa. During the storm, "Snowbell" (AN-52) inflicted minor damage on "Aloe" when the former drifted down on her. "Snowbell's" stern collided with "Aloe's" starboard bow and ripped a hole below the main deck level five feet long.
Post-war inactivation.
Returning to the United States in the spring of 1946 via Saipan, Guam, the Marshalls, and Hawaii, "Aloe" commenced her pre-inactivation overhaul at Swan Island, Portland, Oregon, on 3 June 1946.
Decommissioned on 3 August 1946 and placed in reserve on 26 September 1946, the net tender remained in the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, through the 1950s. Her name was stricken on 9 October 1962. Laid up in the U.S. Maritime Administration berthing area at Olympia, Washington, the ship was sold on 14 May 1971 to I. D. Logan and was scrapped.
The USS "Aloe" is featured in a mural depicting the history of the Houghton area of Kirkland, Washington.
Honors and awards.
"Aloe" received three battle stars for her World War II service.

Matthew Diffee

Matthew ("Matt") Diffee is an American cartoonist whose works appear in the New Yorker magazine.
Biography.
Diffee was born in Denton, Texas.
His father was an airline pilot, and he has a background in art and stand-up comedy which he still performs from time to time. As a struggling artist he took various day jobs, including road work, construction, and as a convenience store cashier.
Diffee moved from Boston, Massachusetts to New York and began contributing to the "New Yorker" in 1999, after winning a cartoon contest the magazine and the Algonquin Hotel sponsored for an all-cartoon issue, in the process meeting Robert Mankoff, the cartoon editor, in person. Mankoff encouraged Diffee to contribute to the magazine. After three weeks of submission Mankoff chose one cartoon, which became Diffee's first published work. For the next year Diffee submitted fifteen cartoons per week; the magazine published a total of four. The next year Diffee sold eight cartoons to the magazine, each at the standard rate of $675.
Diffee's first book, "The Rejection Collection", was a compilation of cartoons by various artists that had been rejected from the magazine along with questionnaires and portraits of each artist. In an interview he noted that 90% of even a successful freelance cartoonist's works are rejected, and that most cartoonists are known only for their work, not their personal lives. Many rejected cartoons are good, he explained, but inappropriate for the magazine because they are politically incorrect or sexually suggestive: "...the idea that the cartoonist did it, and actually pitched it to the New Yorker, makes it even funnier to me, like ‘what were they thinking’?" As of the book's publication the magazine had published more than 100 of Diffee's cartoons, a significant accomplishment for a young cartoonist.
Works.
His works are mostly single-panel satirical pieces. 
Diffee also produces other artwork, and has hosted "the Rejection Show", a monthly off-broadway production devoted to rejected works by successful artists. He plays banjo and fiddle, and recently won a race in the sport of joggling (juggling while running), for which he will appear in an upcoming documentary.
He currently hosts The Steam Powered Hour, a "smart and cozy night of bluegrass music, standup comedy, and cartoons."

Francis Hsueh and Steven Hahn

Francis Hsueh and Steven Hahn (both born in October 1973) are a filmmaking duo based in New York City. Hsueh and Hahn were former corporate lawyers from large New York firms who met in 2004 after becoming solo practitioners. While working on their first case together, they realized that they shared the same dream of making movies. Later that year, they opened Omerice Works Inc., a film production company named after the Korean dish that their first client served them for lunch.
"Party".
In fall 2005, Hsueh and Hahn completed their first film, "Party", a feature-length documentary about New York's Asian nightlife. They shot, directed, edited, scored, produced and financed it themselves. The film features intersecting stories of several party promoters and partygoers, as well as a voiceover narration provided by Prof. Gary Okihiro of Columbia University. "Party" was appeared at the 2007 Rotterdam Asiascope Overseas Asian Film Festival and was chosen for distribution by Pathfinder Pictures in 2006.
"Pretty to Think So".
In early 2006, Hsueh and Hahn began writing their first narrative script, "Pretty to Think So", a love triangle story set in New York City in 2000. Based on the moderate success of "Party", Hahn and Hsueh obtained financing from a Google executive, Michael Zee. In April 2007, they successfully completed photography on the film, which was premiered in March 2008 at the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival. The film toured subsequent Asian American film festivals in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Austin, and had its East Coast premiere at the New York Asian American International Film Festival in July 2008.
"Pretty to Think So", set in the post-internet boom, pre-9/11 limbo period of October 2000, tells the story of a tragic love triangle between Hanna (Pia Shah), a recently laid-off investment banker, Jiwon (Louis Ozawa Changchien), a corporate lawyer, and Alex (Rob Yang), a former street hustler turned youth pastor.
"Leo of St. George and the Air Galactic".
In late 2006, inspired by news of Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space tourism company (scheduled to be launched in 2009), Hsueh and Hahn completed their second feature-length script, "Leo of St. George and the Air Galactic". In April 2008, the script was a finalist in the Beverly Hills Film Festival screenplay competition. In June 2008, the script won a prestigious fellowship from the Korean Film Council's Filmmakers Development Lab which promotes works by overseas Korean filmmakers (Hahn is Korean-American). The script also placed as a Semi-Finalist in the StoryPros 4th Annual International Screenplay Contest (2010).

Ion Brătianu National College (Pitești)

The "Ion C. Brătianu" National College is a comprehensive four-year public high school enrolling 1,200 students in grades 9 through 12. It is named after the Romanian politician Ion C. Brătianu.
History.
The school opened in the fall of 1866 as the first teaching institution in the town of Piteşti and evolved throughout the years, from the original primary school to a secondary 8 grades school, then to a 12 grades one, and finally became a high-school (9-12 grades) in 1965. Today, "Brătianu" is recognized as one of the best high-schools in Romania. Because of its remarkable selectivity, the high admission percentage of its graduates, the very high overall GPA of its students and their excellent results in National Olympiads and other contests, in 1997 the "Ion C. Brătianu" High School was awarded the title of "National College" ("Colegiu Național").
Curriculum.
The academic program is organized on a 2 shift schedule – the morning shift and the evening shift. In accordance to the Romanian curriculum imposed by the Ministry, the students have a fixed weekly schedule that is repeated throughout the two semesters of the academic year. They are organized in groups of approximately 30 students and each of these groups has a certain classroom assigned to it. Students attend six – 50 minutes classes daily.
AP courses or Honors classes are mainly unknown to the Romanian system but their alternative is found in all highschools: special class profiles. Therefore, although the core curricula is imposed by the legislation of the Ministry, the highschool offers partially different kinds of classes depending on the profile chosen by each of the 30 students groups. The offered profiles refer to the class/classes that group should focus upon as it follows:
Grading and Ranking.
The grading system used is the Romanian numerical grading system, with grades ranging from 1 to 10, 10 being the maximum; 5 is the graduating mark. At the end of each semester and at the end of the year, the final grade is obtained through the arithmetic mean of the grades received throughout the year. Where term papers apply (Romanian, Mathematics, Physics, Informatics), this arithmetic mean is multiplied by 3 added with the term paper’s result and divided by 4 to obtain the final grade.
An American style ranking system is not offered but each group of students calculates its own rank and awards diplomas for the highest 3 final grades, and at the end of the 12th grade the school awards the distinction of Chief of graduates to the student with the highest final grade over the four years.
Standardized Testing.
The examination all Romanian students take when they graduate the high school studies is the Baccalaureate exam which consists of the following subjects: Romanian – speaking and writing, a foreign language – speaking, Mathematics, a science (the special profile assigned science – if on a special profile class) and a social science. The graduating mark for the Baccalaureate is 6.
Class of 2009 statistics.
The statistical data for the 2009 class are:
- The final grade of the Chief of graduates : 10
- The average final grade : 9.29
- The percentage of Baccalaureate graduates : 99.71%
- The biggest Baccalaureate grade : 9.95
- The average Baccalaureate grade : 9.42
Ciprian Manolescu, the only three-time winner of the International Mathematics Olympiad, attended Brătianu, as have other 7 international olympiad gold medallists at mathematics, biology and physics.
Romanian ex-President Emil Constantinescu as well as Prime Minister Armand Călinescu, Istrate Micescu and Marshal Ion Antonescu also attended the high school, Constantin Bălăceanu-Stolnici
In arts the high school had many talents like the poets Ion Barbu and Ion Minulescu, Vladimir Streinu, George Valsan, the painters Costin Petrescu and Rudolf Schweitzer-Cumpăna, the writers Tudor Teodorescu Branişte and George Ulieru, the composer Nicolae Brânzeu or Robert Turcescu .

Dakshinee

Dakshinee is one of the premier Music Academies in the city of Calcutta, now Kolkata. It plays an important role in encouraging and promoting primarily the Rabindrasangeet.
History.
Suvo Guha Thakurta was a devotee of Rabindrasangeet. He wanted to spread it among Bengali masses which was then confined primarily to Santiniketan. On the advice of Shailaranjan Majumdar, he founded Dakshinee on 8 May 1948.
Early days.
Dakshinee started with only 12 students and by 1955 it had 600 students. Between 1962 and 1972 the student strength was over 1500.
Sections.
Since inception it had four functioning sections
Publications.
In 2008 Dakshinee proposes to publish a special edition on the occasion of its Diamond Jubilee Celebrations.
Location.
This institute was earlier started at 132, Rashbehari Avenue. In 1955, it was moved to Dakshinee Bhawan, 1 Deshapriya Park (West) and has been there since then.
Controversies.
Although the institute professes to teach Rabindranath Tagore's ideals through his music, credible evidence strongly suggests that Dakshinee believes in instilling a sense of fear among the rank and file of its students, an idea that is wholly contrary to Tagore's own views on any kind of learning. 
Dakshinee also got itself mired in a recent controversy when a letter published in a widely read mainstream Kolkata newspaper alleged that the institute expelled one of its students, an eight year-old girl, only for wearing a "salwar-kameez" (a dress widely used by Indian girls and women).

Reg Flewin

Reginald "Reg" Flewin (28 November 1920 – 24 May 2008) was an English footballer who played as a central defender for his hometown club Portsmouth.
Flewin signed a professional contract with Pompey on his 17th birthday in 1937, and made his senior debut for the club against Grimsby Town in April 1939. Following the outbreak of World War II, Flewin's football career came to a halt. He served in the Royal Marines during hostilities, and occasionally turned out for Portsmouth in wartime football, winning an England wartime cap against Wales on 16 September 1944.
When football resumed at the end of the war, Flewin became a regular in Portsmouth's defence, and was also named the team's captain. He was a member of the Pompey sides that won consecutive league titles in 1948–49 and 1949–50. Flewin retired in 1953, having played 163 first-team matches for Portsmouth. In 1949 his Portsmouth side was tipped to become the first team to win the double but lost to Leicester City at Highbury. If Portsmouth won the Double he would have been the first skipper since John Devey to win it.
Following his playing career, Flewin moved into coaching, first taking charge of Pompey's youth team, and later became assistant to manager Eddie Lever. He remained assistant manager at Portsmouth until October 1960, when he accepted the job as manager of Stockport County. In September 1963, he moved back south to become manager at Bournemouth, where he spent two years before resigning in 1965.
After leaving football, Flewin settled on the Isle of Wight, where he managed the Fort Warden holiday camp in Totland Bay. He died in May 2008, aged 87 a week after the 2008 FA Cup Final.

This is a list of the people to manage Hibernian. Hibs did not officially appoint a manager until 1903 because they did not incorporate until then. From 1875 until 1903, the club were run by a committee, although Dan McMichael was effectively the manager when the club won the 1902 Scottish Cup and the 1903 league championship. Phil Kelso took charge for season 1903–04, but left the club in April 1904 and was replaced by Dan McMichael. Long-serving managers since McMichael include Bobby Templeton, Willie McCartney, Hugh Shaw, Eddie Turnbull and Alex Miller.
Willie McCartney took charge of part of the league-winning 1947–48 season, but he died in office after a Scottish Cup match in January 1948. Hugh Shaw inherited that team, and went on to win three league championships in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Eddie Turnbull, Alex Miller and John Collins all won one Scottish League Cup each. Bobby Templeton, Bertie Auld and Alex McLeish all won second tier championships.

Gail Harris (baseball)

Boyd Gail Harris (October 15, 1931 – November 14, 2012) was a Major League Baseball first baseman who played with the New York Giants and Detroit Tigers from 1955 to 1960. In 1958, Harris hit a career high 20 home runs with the Tigers.
Early years.
Harris was born in Abingdon, Virginia, and was an athletic standout at now-defunct William King High School in Abingdon. He was drafted as an amateur free agent in 1950, and called up to the majors in the summer of 1955.
Major leagues.
Harris hit .232 in 79 games as a rookie, connecting for 12 home runs and driving in 36 runs. His manager was the ferocious Leo Durocher.
Harris struggled in 1956, but rebounded with a solid season in 1957. Late in 1957, Harris achieved a minor distinction by hitting the last homer by a New York Giants player; the team relocated to San Francisco the following season. Harris also had a new destination, as he was traded to the Detroit Tigers in the off-season. 
Harris enjoyed some success in the Motor City. Getting the chance to play on a regular basis, Harris flourished in the summer of 1958 for the Tigers. He smashed 20 home runs, collected 83 RBIs and finished with a .273 batting average. 
Harris’ batting average dipped in 1959, as he hit .221 with nine home runs and 39 RBIs. 
Harris played his last game in the majors on May 3, 1960.
Retirement.
Following his baseball career, he worked in insurance sales. Harris lived in Manassas, Virginia, and his son, Mark, played in the minors briefly and was a minor league instructor for the Kansas City Royals organization.
Death.
Harris died on November 14, 2012.

History of WMPO Radio
Written By John E.M. Kerr
In May 1957, a group of Athens businessmen met to discuss starting a radio station located in Meigs County. Present at the meeting included Roger Jones, attorney; Roy Stephenson, accountant; Frank Rauch, bakery & theater owner; A.H. Kovlan, WATH Radio owner; and John E.M. Kerr, advertising manager for WATH. The group elected to form a corporation called Radio Mid-Pom, Inc. and applied for a broadcast license with the FCC for Meigs County. A search immediately followed to find a building and tower site in Meigs County.
The group learned that the Bailey family in Bradbury was thinking of closing their restaurant. Radio Mid-Pom elected to purchase Bailey's Drive In and lease adjacent acreage for the tower. On August 28, 1959, WMPO 1390 started broadcasting with a staff of five people. An open house was held with both Pomeroy and Middleport mayors giving welcome speeches.
In 1964, WMPO was granted permission to increase power to 5,000 Watts making it one of the strongest stations in the area. The years progressed well and in 1973, WMPO 1390 was granted permission for an FM station to broadcast on 92.1 with 3,000 Watts and a new wing was added to the station building. Ground was leased from Robert Burdett for the new tower. Throughout the period and expansion, two of the stockholders died and their stock was purchased by Jack Kerr and Frank Rauch.
After 30 years of successful operation, the two remaining stockholders elected to sell the stations. E.T. Broadcasting of Dayton purchased WMPO in 1989. Ten years later, the station was sold to Positive Radio Group of Blacksburg, Virginia, the present owners.

<doc id="18691124" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18691124" title="Tulip breaking virus">
Tulip breaking virus

The Tulip breaking virus is one of five plant viruses of the family "Potyviridae" that cause color-breaking of tulip flowers. These viruses infect only two genera of plants: "Tulipa" (tulips) and "Lilium" (lilies), (family Liliaceae). "Tulip-breaking virus (TBV), Tulip top-breaking virus (TTBV), Tulip bandbreaking virus (TBBV), Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus (ReTBV)" and "Lily mottle virus (LMoV)" have all been identified as potyviruses by serology and potyvirus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, sequence analysis of amplified DNA fragments has classified them all as distinct viruses or strains; recently TTBV has been found to be strain-related to turnip mosaic virus.
Tulip breaking virus is a member of the potato virus Y group; a distant serological relationship to tobacco etch virus was discovered in 1971.
Also known as the Tulip break virus, Lily streak virus, Tulip mosaic virus, Lily mosaic virus, or simply TBV, tulip breaking virus is most famous for its dramatic effects on the color of the tulip perianth, which helped to cause the speculative price of rare tulip bulbs during the period of so-called "Tulip mania" in the 17th century Netherlands.
Effects of the virus.
The virus infects the bulb and causes the cultivar to "break" its lock on a single color, resulting in intricate bars, stripes, streaks, featherings or flame-like effects of different colors on the petals. These symptoms vary depending on the plant variety and age at the time of infection. Different types of colour-breaks depend on the variety of tulip and the strain of the virus. The color variegation is caused either by local fading, or intensification and overaccumulation of pigments in the vacuoles of the upper epidermal layer due to the irregular distribution of anthocyanin; this fluctuation in pigmentation occurs after the normal flower color has developed. Because each outer surface is affected, both sides of the petal often display different patterns.
In the lily species, the virus causes mild to moderate mottling or streaking in the leaves about two weeks after inoculation, and then causes the plant to produce distorted leaves and flowers.
The virus also weakens the bulb and retards the plant's propagation through offset growths; as it progresses through each generation the bulb grows stunted and weak. Eventually it has no strength to flower, and either breaks apart or withers away, ending the genetic line. For this reason the most famous examples of tulips from color broken bulbs – the "Semper Augustus" and the "Viceroy" – no longer exist.
History.
Long thought to be the earliest recorded plant virus, it is now thought that TBV comes second; the earliest reference to a virus-induced leaf chlorosis (possibly Tobacco leaf curl virus) was recorded in Japan in 752 AD.
"Breaking" symptomology was first described in 1576 by Carolus Clusius, a Flemish professor of Botany at Leiden, who noted the variegation, or "rectification", so termed because it was believed that with the offset production of an entirely new "broken" bloom the plant was distilling, or rectifying, itself into a pure life form.
Clusius's observations continued; in 1585, he was the first to note that "broken" plants also slowly degenerated. "... any tulip thus changing its original colour is usually ruined afterwards and so wanted only to delight its master's eyes with this variety of colours before dying, as if to bid him a last farewell." It was not known that the virus was responsible for this effect, so for centuries breeders believed that it was environmental conditions that attenuated the bulb and caused single colour tulips to break and streak. They tried to induce "rectification" through frequent soil changes (which causing the bulb to go to seed); varying the planting depths so the plant had to struggle in too much or too little soil; applying too much or too little manure; using soil that was either too poor or too rich; or storing the bulbs in exposed conditions so that they would be 'acted' upon by the rain, wind, sun, and extremes of temperature. However, as early as 1637 Dutch growers were able to produced new broken varieties through bulb grafting, by combining "broken" bulbs infected with the virus with healthy bulbs that produced uniformly colored flowers.
At the end of the eighteenth century, the notion that "breaking" in tulips was a manifestation of some kind of chronic disorder or weakness in the bulb was certainly considered among botanists; but it was still more or less understood that adverse environmental conditions were to blame. A comment by William Hanbury in 1770 that: "All variegations are diseases in a plant and nothing is so proper to bring this about as a defect in nutriment." bears out this general attitude. Given the lack of knowledge of human infectious diseases at this time (and well into the 19th century) this was not an unusual conclusion, but what is surprising is that while tulip mosaic disease has a far more impressive and documented history than any other plant virus, the realization that it was a communicable plant disease, let alone a virus, came surprisingly late – a decade after the end of World War I. "Plant virus" to plant pathologists at the time was almost synonymous with the tobacco mosaic virus, which had been discovered in 1897, quite soon after bacteriology had become established as an academic subject. Since the prime characteristics of the tobacco mosaic virus are that it damages the leaves and flowers of the plant, stunts growth, and lowers quantity and quality of the crop, it is puzzling to many academics and scientists that twenty more years passed before "breaking" was even suspected of being virus-induced.
Pathogen discovery.
By the mid-1920s, biochemistry was coming into its own, and its impact was felt in virus research. Eventually, it was series of bulb manipulation experiments begun in 1928 by Dorothy Cayley at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Norfolk, England that led to the discovery of the virus. Cayley discovered that by mechanically transferring infected tissue from broken bulbs to healthy bulbs during their dormant state, the virus that caused the break in color would also be transferred. These experiments were further refined down to minute amounts, which led her to correctly conclude that the "virus or enzyme infection" was sap-transmissible, probably transferred by an insect, and the degree of breaking was proportional to the amount of infected tissue introduced.
The virus was eventually proved to be transferred in a non-persistent manner by at least four species of aphids, specifically "Myzus persica" (the most efficient), "Macrosiphum euphorbiae", "Doralis fabae" and "Aphis gossypii". McKenny-Hughes reported in 1934 that "Yezabura tulipae" transmitted the virus between stored tulip bulbs, but this has not been confirmed. The transfer of the virus is non-persistent, which means it is accomplished through the insect feeding. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet in the insect's mouthparts, so that the next plant it feeds on is inoculated with the virus. The virus does not affect the seed that produces a bulb, only the bulb itself, its leaves and blooms, and its daughter offsets.
It was not until the 1960s that TBV was shown to have flexuous filamentous particles (mostly measuring about 12×750 nm) and finally proved to be a virus. The genetic code of TBV has now been partially sequenced and the virus is recognized as a member of the genus Potyvirus (family Potyviridae). Like other members of the genus it is now readily detected and identified by serological and molecular techniques.
Viral strains.
Two separate strains of the virus – Severe Tulip Breaking Virus (STBV) and Mild Tulip Breaking Virus (MTBV) – have been determined by the type and severity of the symptoms they cause. In certain varieties STBV causes "full breaking" or "light breaking", when due to a lack of anthocyanin, pigment present in the surface chromoplast cells fades and the lighter color (white or yellow) of the internal mesophyll is exposed, appearing as irregular streaks or fine featherings. In the same varieties MTBV causes "self breaking" or "dark breaking", which occurs because anthocyanins are formed in excess, so the color in the epidermal cells is intensified in dark streaks or elongated flecks and sworls. Breaking commonly occurs along the edges and tops of petals and sepals. The most common type of breaking found in naturally infected plants, called "average break", is caused by infection with a mixture of STBV and MTBV; both "light breaking" and "dark breaking" symptoms are present, together with some unbroken areas, in different parts of the same petal. Plants infected with a mixture of strains when young may exhibit both effects, with "light breaking" symptoms restricted to the basal part of the petal and severe "dark breaking" effects in the upper parts. Some varieties were later found by to be incapable of "light breaking", and always showed "dark breaking" symptoms no matter whether infected with STBV or MTBV or a mixture of both strains. Although they still can be infected, white and yellow flowered varieties are incapable of breaking since they lack anthocyanins; their color is determined by colourless or yellow plastids in the mesophyll. Other outward symptoms can include leaf mottling.
Distribution.
Control of the virus is notoriously difficult. Its distribution is world-wide and had been reported in all temperate regions where tulips are grown; it is particularly common in southern Europe where the aphid vectors are abundant early in the growing season. Virus transmission by aphids causes millions of dollars of damage in the flower bulb sector annually. Mineral oils and pyrethroids are applied weekly during the growth season to decrease the virus transmission in flower bulbs, and current research projects are attempting to learn about the risk of non-persistent virus transmission in relation to aphid population dynamics.
Most recently, population dynamics of aphids in tulip fields were monitored during three growing seasons. Simultaneously, the period of TBV transmission by aphids was investigated experimentally by exposing small tulip plots during specified intervals to naturally occurring aphids. Finally, timing of virus spread was correlated with aphid population dynamics and weather conditions. In 2007 it was discovered that TBV transmission started in April, while the first aphids were not found until May. Apparently, the first aphids of the season had already contributed, in great extent, to the virus transmission, which was observed locally in the tulip plots. In addition, a second, but distinct, TBV isolate was identified, which resulted in the design of an improved TBV detection assay. These results should enable formulatation of crop protection guidelines that are fine-tuned with the risk of virus transmission, which will help decrease environmental damage caused by pesticides.
In an effort to restrict the virus, the United States, Great Britain and other countries prohibit the commercial sale of broken bulbs, or bulbs known to be infected by the virus. As TBV-infected bulbs gradually degenerate, the virus can be minimized by removing and destroying 'broken' bulbs quickly before aphids spread the virus to other bulbs or cross-contaminating lily hosts.
Broken tulips today.
Today, tulips like "Rem's Sensation" displaying a "broken" effect are stable variants and the result of breeding, not viral infection, although many tulip fanciers feel these "modern" variants are a poor substitute when compared to the long-extinct rare cultivars like "Semper Augustus". Modern tulip varieties infected with the virus are fragile, and are usually much smaller than normal healthy blooms, with a reduced stem length. There are only a few varieties of older, truly "broken" tulips still in existence, but only because the worst aspects of the virus have somehow remained benign. One such example is the rare "Absalon", which dates from 1780; a "bizarre" colored variety, it displays gold flames against a dark chocolate brown background.

<doc id="18691133" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18691133" title="Eurasia Canal">
Eurasia Canal

The Eurasia Canal (, "Kanal "Evraziya"") is a proposed 700-kilometre (430 mi) long canal connecting the Caspian Sea to the lower Black Sea along the Kuma-Manych Depression, which is often considered the border between Europe and Asia. Currently, a chain of lakes and reservoirs and the shallow irrigation Kuma-Manych Canal are found along this route.
The canal is intended to provide a shorter route for shipping than the existing Volga-Don Canal system of waterways; it would also require fewer locks (or lower-rise locks) than the Volga-Don route.
Manych Ship Canal is the existing canal system that would be the likely route for the Eurasian Canal.
Potential shipping route.
The route of the canal, as usually proposed, would follow the thalweg (the lowest-ground line) of the Kuma-Manych Depression.
From the Caspian Sea westward, the canal route would follow:
Locks.
As the highest point of this route is only 27 meters above the level of the Sea of Azov and 54 m above that of the Caspian Sea, the preliminary design presented by the Hydraulic Facilities Safety Expert Center "GIDROTEKHEXPERTIZA" (Экспертный центр по безопасности гидротехнических сооружений "Гидротехэкспертиза") proposes the construction of three to four low-rise ship locks on the western slope and three mid-rise or six low-rise locks on the eastern slope. The option involving the construction of six low-rise locks on the eastern slope of the watershed can significantly reduce the volume of earthwork and lower by one-third the need for freshwater, which is precalculated as approximately 1.5 cubic km. 
This compares favorably with the 13 locks of the existing Volga-Don Canal, where ships use nine locks to rise 88 m from the Volga to the canal's highest point, and then four more locks to descend 44 m to the Don's Tsimlyansk Reservoir.
Water supply.
The Kuma-Manych depression area is quite arid, with annual precipitation no more than 400 mm (in the western section) and 200 mm (in the eastern section). To operate a shipping canal with locks, a significant additional supply of freshwater is necessary. Three options for its provision are being considered:
Supplying the Manych Waterway with freshwater from the Volga using the first or second option can compensate the Sea of Azov for the volume of freshwater that is now lost by the Don River to the locks of the Volga-Don Ship Canal.
History.
The Soviet government decided to construct the Manych Waterway connecting the Black and Caspian Seas via the Kuma-Manych Depression in May 1932. In the same year construction started in the West Manych River Valley. According to the 1936 construction project, the shipping route consisted of three sections. The first, western, section from the Don River to the Chogray Reservoir on the East Manych, 448 km long, was planned as a cascade of reservoirs, the torages); the second section – from the Chogray Dam to the Kuma River – was to be built as a canal with a water depth of 3 m, bottom width of 67 m, and length of 73 km. The third, eastern, section, 150 km long, was intended as a free-flow navigable and irrigation canal (along the lower course of the Kuma) reaching a port on the Caspian coast. Of these three sections, only the first was ever built.
By 1941, the cascade of dams on the West Manych was completed. It created three reservoirs, in the following (east to west) order: Proletarsk (Proletarskoye) Reservoir (Пролетарское водохранилище), 150 km long, Vesyolovsk (Vesyolovskoe) Reservoir (Весёловское водохранилище), 100 km long, and Ust'-Manych (Ust'-Manychskoye) Reservoir (Усть-Манычское водохранилище), 62 km long. The uppermost reservoir of the cascade, the Proletarskoye, is in fact connected with the source of the Western Manych, Lake Manych-Gudilo, the Proletarsk dam raising the water level in the lake. This system of reservoirs and ship locks creates the so-called Manych Waterway, 329 km long but only 1.3 m deep. It is still used for shipping, but on a very minor scale.
With the outbreak of the Second World War further construction of the Manych Ship Canal was suspended. After the war, destroyed or damaged dams and locks of the shipping canal were reconstructed, but the plans for continuing the construction further eastward were canceled, since the much deeper Volga-Don Shipping Canal was built instead, and the existing demands for freight transport did not justify a second canal between the Caspian and the Black/Azov Sea basins.
Further east, on the East Manych River (which flows east), the Chogray Reservoir, 48.8 km long, was constructed in 1969-1973, but at that time the focus was on irrigation, not shipping.
Recent developments.
The Russian government's interest in improvement of the waterways between the Caspian basin and that of the Azov and Black Seas - which may or may not involve the Eurasia Canal route - is due to the increasing volume of cargo traffic between the Volga-Caspian basin and European countries, as well as the inadequacy of existing facilities on the Volga-Don Canal for handling the expected cargo flows. The proponents of the project refer to a study of freight shipping in southern Russia by the Central Research Institute of Economy and Water Transport Exploitation (), a research center of Russia's Ministry of Transport. This study predicts significant growth in the demand for freight transportation, in particular for liquid cargoes, between the Caspian region and the ports of southern and central Europe. The study also suggests that a significant amount of cargo shipped between the Asian countries and western Europe can be redirected to the canal as well. 
On June 15, 2007, at the 17th Foreign Investors’ Council Meeting in Ust-Kamenogorsk, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan proposed the Eurasia Canal project to build a canal connecting the Caspian and Black Seas. The project was estimated to cost US$6 billion and take 10 years to complete.
If built, the nearly 700 km (430 mi) Eurasia Canal would be four times longer than the Suez Canal and eight times longer than the Panama Canal. President Nazarbayev stated that the canal would make Kazakhstan a maritime power and benefit many other Central Asian nations as well. Russia has proposed an alternative plan to upgrade the existing Volga-Don Canal.
In June 2009 the President of Kalmykia, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, signed a protocol of intent with the Chinese SINOHYDRO Corporation about cooperating in the construction of the Manych Ship Canal - Eurasia Canal 
Before it was regulated, the West Manych river consisted of 15 small lakes, connected by narrow streams. After spring flooding, the Manych quickly became shallow because the geological structure of Manych depression looks like ideal plain with “plates” and hollows scattered on it with depth, as a rule, not more than 2 m. In summer, this place often looked like flat cracked saline land, in some areas sparkling with the whiteness of salt.
In the second half of twentieth century's economic use of Manych steppes became stronger. In 1948 Nevinnomyssky canal was complete and water from Kuban River began to flow to reservoirs of Manych. By summer of 1954 water level of Proletarskoe reservoir reached the altitude mark of -11,9 m and Manych-Gudilo lake became full-flowing. The saltiness of the water system rapidly decreased, lakes filled with water, many of them forming one connected system.
Filling of Manych with water, creation of water supply canals led to appearance of considerable quantity of new comfortable places for nesting and increasing of quantity of fodder resources for wading birds. During first 15–20 years after the construction of tandem reservoir system biodiversity of fish fauna was considerably increased, some species of fish gained in importance of fishery.
However, at present time because of water saltiness increase fish yields in Proletarskoe reservoir significantly decreased, even down to the minimum and fishing is possible only in mouths of rivers which fall into reservoirs. Completion of construction of canal make possible supplying of Mancy-Gudilo Lake with freshwater under human control, which can reduce water saltiness level down to best value. In result, biodiversity of fish fauna and its productivity would be increased.
With a view to intensifying further economic development of the south of Russia, completion of construction of the canal proves the barest necessity. Construction of additional processing capacities for the oil and gas fields discovered on the near-Caspian territory of Russia will result in the need to carry up to 15 million tons of cargo per annum by 2020.
At the same time, there are plans of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan to create their own processing capacities, in the expectation that the total amount of processed oil products will reach 25 million tons. That amount will most probably be carried to Western Europe rather on waterways than by railway. Also, tanker transportation of oil from the Caspian shelf oilfield to the processing capacities of LUKOIL and KAZMUNAIGAZ on the Black Sea shore without transshipment seems like an optimal solution.
Modernization of the existing "Volga-Don" navigation canal can only meet the requirements of Russian companies. Thus, aware of the impossibility to convey cargo from the Caspian states to Western Europe through the existing and prospective Russian transport routes by 2020, their representatives are sure to lead negotiations on construction of a transport corridor through Azerbaijan to the Georgian seaports in the Black Sea or through Iran to the Persian Gulf. 
It is in the national interests of Russia to create an cost-beneficial universal transport route that could satisfy all the requirements of the economically developing Caspian countries. If Russia abandons construction of the Manych Ship Canal, it is unlikely to be able to provide competitive cargo tariffs and, thus, is sure to lose a considerable part of the profits from the transit of cargo from the expanding economies of the Caspian region countries. 
For the south of Russia, completion of construction of the canal can become a key factor in forming industrial clusters benefitting from the shipping route (territories of Republics of Kalmykia and Dagestan, Stavropol and Krasnodarsky Territories, Rostov and Astrakhan regions)
Freshwater from the canal will increase watering of arid areas and, thereby, the yields of agriculture and husbandry. It is possible to construct a hydroelectric pumped storage power plants on the base of canal facilities . Such power plants could significantly increase the operating benefits of wind-driven power plants planned to be constructed in the Republic of Kalmykia and Stavropol Territory.
Implementation of the project will shorten delivery time and cut down transport expenses, which is sure to contribute to the competitive ability of the Russian transport network. Construction and maintenance of the canal will promote further development of regional productive forces, such as the establishment of new enterprises and, thus, new workplaces in regions with high unemployment rates, reducing social tension and extending the taxable basis.
In conclusion, if one compares possible consequences of ecocatastrophes to appear while transporting oil and oil-products by tankers with capacity of 5 000 tons along the Manych Ship Canal and Volga-Don Waterway, it is evident that negative influence on the unique natural complex of the Volga-Akhtuba inter-river area is sure to be more severe, for out of strong current along the navigation part of the river and numerous shoals and ducts it is almost impossible to localize an oil patch. 
In case of shipwreck (as a result of any cause) of tanker freight-carrying capacity of 5000 tons with oil spillage, for example, near Volgograd, whole lower part of Volga including protected areas and nature reserves would suffer catastrophic damage. The same is true for the lower part of the Don. So, just because of that, it must be forbidden to use of tankers with capacity over 5 000 tons for transportation of oil and oil-products without extreme necessity along the natural waterways, including the Volga-Don Waterway.
On the Manych Ship Canal a such shipwreck will lead to local limited extent pollution between shipping locks. A system of locks would allow to control flow velocity and reduce the speed of oil patch spread down to minimum and quickly remove results of oil spill.
Also it must be noted that during a 30 year period the water level of the Caspian Sea can vary within 4 m. In case of recession of water level of Caspian Sea down to true altitude of -29 m depths of the lower Volga would decrease and it would be very difficult to maintain ship movement via this part of Volga-Don Waterway in the dimension planned.
A the same time, the level of the shipping lock of the Manych Ship Canal near the Caspian Sea can be designed taking water level fluctuation into consideration.
Analysis of influence of the Manych Ship Canal on closely guarded natural areas and districts with controlled regime of economical
activity in the Republic of Kalmykia
The proposed project of a new water transport connection is not only an important part of the prospective national transport system (to serve internal and international cargo traffic, including transportation of Caspian oil) but also a multipurpose water-resources scheme with huge economic potential for the region.
It is evident that construction of a canal in the arid zone should be preceded by fundamental studies of prospective consequences for the environment. Implementation of the project is connected with considerable earth excavation when laying the canal track.
An environmental impact statement can be presented only at the design stage. Minimization of negative ecological impact can only be provided if the individual design companies and experts involved co-ordinate their technical decisions. Some scientists have made wrong assumptions about whether the saltwater of the Azov Sea can fall into the canal.
According to the project concept the watershed point is in Chograi reservoir; freshwater along the western slope (27 m) travels down to the Don and along the eastern slope (54 m) to the Caspian Sea. Thus, the whole canal track will be filled with freshwater.
In general, negative consequences for the environment of the south of Russia are expected to be insignificant. The positive consequences of implementation of the project are as follows:
1. Creation of prerequisites for social, economic, agricultural, and industrial
development; development of nature conservation and of a fish processing industry in the adjacent regions of Kalmykia, Dagestan, Stavropol Krai and Rostov Oblast.
2. Improvement of water supply in the arid zone. Nowadays every fourth citizen of the coastal zone in the Republic of Kalmykia suffers from kidney infections caused by saline subsoil water and the transfer of salt by wind from the area adjacent to the Manych Lake. After construction of the Manych Ship Canal it will be possible to supply the Manych-Gudilo Lake with freshwater under human control, which can reduce water saltiness down to an optimum level.
3. Investigations of the local ecosystems increase of assessments for nature
conservation.
4. Job growth, creation of workplaces, an end to the outflow of the able-bodied population, influx of qualified specialists from other regions and cities.
5. Widening of the existing social infrastructure (housing, kindergartens, educational and cultural institutions, hospitals, etc.); improvement in the state of people's health; optimization of the demographic and environmental situation in the region.
The mentioned engineering and construction measures and implementation of the project in general can even extenuate the existing negative processes in the Manych-Chograi ecosystem. Thus, to foresee all the aspects of environmental safety in the arid zone of the south of Russia basic research on prognostics and modeling of climatic volatility is required. 
It should be mentioned that if the canal is fed from the area of permanently fresh water near the mouth of the Volga river via pumping water up along the eastern cascade of the main canal, it would be possible to use plans of construction of wind-electric set for power supply of pumps.
For water supply of processes of locking on the canal amount of electricity power of 60 MW will be enough. Such amount can be provided by construction of 30 wind-electric sets with output of 3 MW each. In the variant of construction of the Canal using 6 locks it meets the construction of 10 sets near every of 3 locks on the eastern slope of the Canal. Besides of that, it will be possible to use return part of energy during lockage.
Thereby, canal facilities can be used to hold back water upstream of the Canal for power generation according to pumped-storage hydroelectricity scheme in time of peak level of electricity consumption and zero-wind condition. Thus, this canal can become the first large-scale ecological hydraulic structure in Russia. In addition, the canal can minimize negative effect to nature made by our predecessors. Completion of construction of Manych Ship Canal can become an example of comprehensive approach on the development of arid area in the world of today.
This assessment is preliminary and can only become more concrete after conducting proper comprehensive ecological and engineer research of the area through which the canal track will be laid, and after the planned engineering solution and the operating regime of the Canal have been agreed.
Completion of construction of the Manych Ship Canal, which will link Caspian and Azov Seas and provide an outlet to the world ocean for the south of Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the northern part of Iran, cab become an important factor in developing the whole Southern Federal District. 
In contrast to pipeline transportation, water transport allows all types of cargo to be shipped, including products of the hydrocarbon process industry, which cannot be transported by pipelines or such transporting of which is not profitable. A ship canal would be an important factor in developing manufacturing industries in the South of Russia (Republics of Kalmykia and Dagestan, Stavropol and Krasnodarskiy Territories, Rostov and Astrakhan Regions). Oil and gas processing, the chemical industry, and other export-oriented production can obtain a high-power development impulse.
Decrease of the unemployment rate would also be one of the most important results of completion of construction of the Manych Ship Canal. Southern Federal District is the most problematic region of Russia with a view to the employment of the population, which is one of the causes of an increase in social tensions .
Lack of employment leads to a drift of the population away from the region while a narrow range of choice of needed professions, as a rule, limited to agriculture and husbandry, brings highly skilled specialists, among them graduates of the best colleges or universities of Russia, to look for a job away from home. The present birthrate in the south of Russia, the highest in the Russian Federation, suggests that the problem of employment may be further aggravated if the present situation does not change. Completion of canal construction would lead to the emergence of a considerable quantity of new jobs in the production sector, including operation of the Canal (oil processing/refining, chemical industry, other export-oriented production) and in the process of construction and operation of the navigational route . It should be mentioned that creation of new jobs in the productive industry leads to an increasing number of employees in service industries.
Freshwater from the canal would favour an increase of productivity in agriculture and husbandry. Desalinization of strongly saline water bodies through which the canal route goes will significantly improve water quality and benifit fishery.
Completion of construction of the Manych Ship Canal will lead to the emergence of manufacturing activities, a significant decrease of the unemployment rate, normalization of the migration situation, increasing incomes, and improvement to the well-being of the population.
Scientific and technical aspects to feasibility studies of new water and land routes have always been relevant for the densely populated south of Russia. From this viewpoint the intention to construct a navigation canal should be thoroughly studied lest there should be environmentally negative consequences. It is evident that a total estimate of possible consequences must be made during the concepual and planning phase. Initially, the basic risk factors are as follows:
1. Increase in salinity of soil as a result of underflooding (subsoil water);
2. Possibility to bring in elements of flora and fauna which are foreign to the region;
3. Menace of oil pollution of the water basin and littoral (coastal) ecosystems.
Measures to lessening prospective negative influence should be based on the above mentioned potential menaces. Thus, to prevent further underflooding and soil salinization concrete lining of the canal invert and banks or other measures to decrease percolating water losses are required. This will also help diminish the intensity of abrasive processes (deterioration of the shoreline).
According to the project concept, there will be no direct waterway between the Azov and Caspian seas, for the watershed is on the level of the Chograi reservoir. A complex of measures for control over the ballast waters, elaboration of technical procedure for their sterilization will greatly diminish the danger of mutual penetration of foreign fauna.
The closed reservoirs of the Kuma-Manych depression are nowadays over-mineralized which results in soil salinization of the adjacent areas and appearance of unusable agricultural areas. Inflow of water is sure to lead to less mineralization of water and as a part of it- partial desalinization of the soil.
To prevent oil pollution the barest necessity is to strictly observe the existing regulations for tanker oil transportation. Absence of constant current and the designed system of waterworks installations are to facilitate localization of oil patches and other types of surface pollution and removal of its consequences.
500 of 700 km of the designed canal track passes through the existing reservoirs, and, in fact, requires deepening of the canal invert.
Minimization of the environmentally negative impact can only be provided if separate design companies and environment experts co-ordinate their technical decisions and strictly observe the technical regulations and norms.
Taking into account the above, implementation of the project of constructing the "Eurasia" navigation canal is consider feasible and will not have environmentally negative consequences.
The most probable technical parameters of the Eurasia Canal are: 6.5 m depth, 110 m width and more than 75 million tons per year of traffic capacity. The canal is envisaged for the passage of vessels with a freight-carrying capacity up to 10,000 tons .

Nettie McBirney

Nettie Williams McBirney (November 24, 1887 – December 16, 1982) was a Tulsa inventor, writer and entrepreneur, who wrote a cooking column under the pseudonym Aunt Chick for the "Tulsa Daily World" from 1935 to 1955.
Biography.
Born November 24, 1887, Nettie McBirney earned a home economics degree from the Stout Institute in Menomonie, Wisconsin. She moved to Claremore, Oklahoma in 1909 to teach home economics. Two years later, she became supervisor of home economics at Muskogee schools. After marrying Sam P. McBirney, coach of the University of Tulsa football team and vice president of the National Bank of Commerce, she settled in Tulsa in 1916.
In 1935, she approached "Tulsa World" editor N.G. Henthorne about writing a cooking column that contained simple advice and taught cooking techniques. "Kitchen Log" ran five times a week in the "World" through 1955. She also became a demonstration chef, first at Vandever's Department Store and other stores in Tulsa, and later in many other parts of the country. 
McBirney began inventing kitchen aids during the Depression, such as a non-stick pastry canvas and rolling pin cover and a pie pan that promised perfect bottom crusts on pies. The invention she became best known for was her Cooky Molding Cutter, now known as Gramma's Cutter, a cookie cutter designed to easily release the molded cookie dough and maintain a 3-D appearance. She began selling them in 1948 and they quickly caught on; Princess Margaret purchased a set of the cookie cutters for Prince Charles in 1952, and Wrigley purchased, then sold 70,000 sets as a special promotion the same year.
Marriage and children.
She married banker Samuel P. McBirney in 1913. The couple had four children: Susan Bush, Williams, Samuel, and Mary Megan Bryan.
Death and afterward.
Nettie McBirney died on December 16, 1982. Her collection of about 1,000 cookbooks was donated to the Tulsa City-County Library in 1973.
Published works.
While writing her Kitchen Log column, Aunt Chick also found time to write several cookbooks, most of which dealt with pies and other desserts. Most notable is "Aunt Chick’s Pies", which sold over 650,000 copies.

Battle of Acajutla

The Battle of Acajutla was a battle on June 8, 1524, between the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado and an army of Pipils, an indigenous people, in the neighborhood of present day Acajutla, near the coast of western El Salvador.
Antecedents.
Hernán Cortés, after conquering the city of Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec empire, delegated the conquest of the territories southward to his lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado, who set out with 120 horsemen, 300 footsoldiers and several hundred Cholula and Tlaxcala auxiliaries. After subduing the highland Mayan city-states of present-day Guatemala through battle and co-optation, the Spanish sought to extend their dominion to the lower Atlantic region of the Pipils, then dominated by the powerful city-state of Cuzcatlán. The Kaqchikel Mayans, who had long been rivals of Cuscatlán for control over their wealthy cacao-producing region, joined forces with Alvarado's men and supported his campaign against their enemies. Accompanied by thousands of Kaqchikel warriors, Alvarado then marched on Cuscatlán. The army arrived at the present territory of El Salvador, across the Paz River, on June 6, 1524. Receiving word of the approaching Spanish forces, the Pipil peasants who lived nearby had fled.
Battle.
On June 8, 1524, the conquerors arrived in the neighborhood of Acajutla at a village called Acaxual. There, according to records, a battle ensued between the opposing armies, with the Pipils wearing cotton armor (of three fingers' thickness, according to Alvarado) and carrying long lances. This circumstance would be crucial in the progression of the battle. Alvarado approached the Pipil lines with his archers' showers of crossbow arrows, but the natives did not retreat. The conquistador noticed the proximity of a nearby hill and knew that it could be a convenient hiding place for his opponents. Alvarado pretended that his army had given up the battle and retreated. The Pipils suddenly rushed the invaders, giving Alvarado an opportunity to inflict massive losses. The Pipils that fell to the ground could not get back on their feet, hindered by the weight of their cotton armor, which enabled the Spanish to slaughter them.
In the words of Alvarado: "...the destruction was so great that in just a short time there were none which were left alive...". However, Alvarado's army were not completely unscathed. In the battle Alvarado himself was struck by a sling shot to his thigh which fractured his femur bone. According to local tradition the stone that hit the conquistador was hurled by a Pipil "Tatoni" (a prince) called Atonal. The resultant infection lasted about eight months and left Alvarado partially crippled. In spite of this wound, he continued the conquest campaign with relish.

Super Sleuth Christmas Movie

Super Sleuth Christmas Movie is a 2007 film based on the hit Playhouse Disney series "My Friends Tigger & Pooh". It was released direct-to-video. It premiered on Playhouse Disney on December 6, 2008.
Plot.
It's almost Christmas Eve, and Darby, Buster, Pooh, Tigger and their friends from the Hundred Acre Wood are waiting that night. Everyone goes to Pooh's house to celebrate. While Roo and Lumpy went outside to play, everyone discusses their wishes. Eeyore's wish is to fly. Roo and Lumpy found a red sack and a reindeer named Holly stuck in a thicket patch. After calling the Super Sleuths they help Holly out and took her to Rabbit's House where everybody else is waiting. They learn that she is one of Santa's reindeers who is searching for Santa's magical sack after it fell off of Santa's sleigh during a practice run. It turns out that the sack that Roo and Lumpy found is what Holly was looking for. The only problem is she doesn't know how to get home which means that there won't be any Christmas. Everybody except Kanga set off to the North Pole. After coming across two paths they begin to wonder which way to go. Darby suggests to follow the North Star. Roo, Lumpy, and Holly get separated from the others and fall down a pit. After many failed attempts to get out, the others arrive using Tigger as a rope to get them out. Tigger uses his mask to get Lumpy out, but it falls down to the pit, but they were able to get Lumpy out. Forcing to leave Tigger's mask behind, they discovered the North Star is blocked by cloud. Everybody except Darby, Buster, and Holly felt like giving up and wanting to go home. She fails to convince them to not give up and decides to go on her own. The others, having changed their minds, quickly follow her. They discover some giant snowmen which come to life when walking through them. Piglet was scared at first, but Holly says there's going to take them to Santa. After the snowmen sing and dance around them, the way to the North Pole was there. They manage to giving Santa his magical sack back before he can cancel Christmas. They then decide to help Santa deliver presents, in which Eeyore and Holly are hitched up at the front of the sleigh (there was nothing holding the reindeer to the sleigh, but it seems they were held by magic). Tigger is still sad about the loss of his mask, but Santa cheers him up by giving him a new mask. They begin traveling across the world, throwing presents down the chimneys and tumbling under the trees (Eeyore's wish to fly had came true). Santa takes them back to the Hundred Acre Wood and returns to the North Pole. The gang celebrate Christmas in Pooh's house where Kanga was waiting for them.

Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, music critic Rick Anderson wrote of the album "It has the smooth Nashville production characteristic of his albums of the time, but that's not really a flaw — even if it takes some of the leather out of his playing, having a full backing band extends his appeal beyond the hillbilly curtain, and to many ears, that's a good thing... Doc recorded many albums in this style, but for newcomers this is a nice sampler of his middle years."

The "Byeolmuban" army had six divisions: Yun Gwan's regular army and Armor Guards called "Jeonggyugun" (정규군, 正規軍) Infantry called "Sinbogun" (신보군, 神步軍), Cavalry called "Sin-gigun" (신기군, 神騎軍), an army of Buddhist monks called "Hangmagun" (항마군, 神步軍), Supporting troop made of slaves called "Yeonhogun" (연호군,烟戶軍), and volunteered soldiers made of merchants and ordinary citizens called Jubugunhyeon (주부군현, 州府郡縣). 
Combating troops were divided into Assassin/Spies called "Sinbo" (신보, 神步), Siege Engineers called "Dotang" (도탕, 跳蕩), Archers called "Gyeonggung" (경궁, 梗弓), Builders called "Jeongno" (정노, 精弩), Ballistic/Cannon gunners called "Balhwa" (발화, 發火), and special force called "Teugibudae" (특기부대, 特技部隊). They were to trained and maintain/make weapons & fight with regular army.
During the second year of king Yejong of Goryeo's reign the byeomuban, consisting of 170,000 soldiers, attacked Jurchen and killed approximately 5,000 Jurchen troops, detained another 5,000 POWs and 350 Jurchen tribal clans and took over their territory by building nine fortresses at Hamju region.
Fortresses were called Northeastern Nine Fortresses, and they are in Hamju (함주, 咸州), Yeongju (영주, 英州), Ungju (웅주, 雄州), Bokju (복주, 福州), Gilju (길주, 吉州), Gongheomjin, (공험진, 公咽鎭), Sungnyeong (숭녕, 崇寧), Tongtae (통태, 通泰), and Jinyang (진양, 眞陽).
However internal trouble at the Goryeo court later forced the Goryeo army to leave Jurchen territory just after few years.

3rd Light Horse Brigade

The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was a mounted infantry brigade of the First Australian Imperial Force which served in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.
The brigade first saw action during the Dardanelles Campaign in the Battle of Gallipoli where they were noted for their charge during the Battle of the Nek. After being withdrawn to Egypt in February 1916 they were involved in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign until the end of the war. They were attached to a number of different formations being part of the New Zealand and Australian Division in December 1914, the Anzac Mounted Division in March 1916 and the Australian Mounted Division in June 1917 who they remained with until the end of the war
Formation.
The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was raised in response to a promise made by the Australian Government to supply a division of 20,000 Australians comprising infantry, artillery and cavalry to be used at the discretion of Britain. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was part of the 3rd Contingent that was hastily put together at the beginning of October 1914. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was primarily raised from recruits serving in the various militia light horse formations created as a consequence of the Kitchener Report 1910 and the introduction of Universal Training.
The Brigade.
8th Light Horse Regiment.
This Regiment was recruited exclusively from Victoria.
9th Light Horse Regiment.
This was a composite Regiment recruited from South Australia with two squadrons and Victoria which formed one squadron.
10th Light Horse Regiment.
Originally recruited in Western Australia as "C" Squadron 7th Light Horse Regiment but extended to become a Regiment (10th Light House Regiment) in its own right. It was recruited exclusively from Western Australia and the Militia 25th Australian Horse.
3rd Light Horse Machine Gun Squadron.
Initially, each Regiment within the Brigade raised their own Machine Gun Section which consisted of two troops and two Maxim machine guns. This situation remained from 1914 until in July 1916, when all Regimental Machine Gun Sections were excised and brigaded to form a Machine Gun Squadron. The 8th, 9th and 10th Machine Gun Sections were combined to form the 3rd Machine Gun Squadron under the command of the Brigade. The 3rd Light Horse Machine Gun Squadron was armed with 12 machine guns.
3rd Light Horse Signal Troop.
The 3rd Signal Troop was created on 1 April 1916 by drafting in four signallers from each of the 12 Regiments at the Suez Canal.
3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance.
Originally recruited at Melbourne in October 1914 to form part of the 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance, when Military Order 575 of 1914 created the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the unit became the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance.
3rd Light Horse Brigade Train.
The 3rd Light Horse Brigade Train was primarily recruited around Melbourne and trained at Broadmeadows. After Gallipoli, this unit underwent some name changes from 3rd Supply Section in February 1916 to 35th Australian Army Service Corps Company in February 1917.
8th Mobile Veterinary Section.
Prior to 1916, each Regiment maintained their own Veterinary Section, usually consisting of half a troop. After the formation of the Anzac Mounted Division in 1916, the three individual Regimental Veterinary sections were brigaded to form the 8th Mobile Veterinary Section.
Artillery.
Artillery support was provided for the 3rd Light Horse Brigade from British batteries. The first British battery attached to the Brigade was the Inverness-shire Battery of the British IV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). This battery remained until the re-organisation of February 1917 when the Inverness Battery was replaced by the 1/1 Nottingham Battery of XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.).
3rd Light Horse Training Regiment.
The 3rd Light Horse Training Regiment was formed in Egypt during March 1916, tasked with training incoming reinforcements while allowing the wounded and sick a place to recover before returning to active service. The Training Regiment contained three squadrons, each duplicating the Regiments within the Brigade to whom it supplied the reinforcements. The Training Regiment was disbanded in July 1918 to be replaced by the Anzac Light Horse Training Regiment when recruits were no longer tied to a Regiment but placed in a general pool of reinforcements called the General Service Reinforcements.
3rd Light Horse Double Squadron.
Formed Egypt 6 July 1916 from 3rd Light Horse Brigade reinforcements. It was officered and administered by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. This Double Squadron was broken up in November 1916 with the men being transferred to the newly formed Imperial Camel Corps Battalions.
Embarkation.
The Brigade embarked to Egypt during the months of February and March 1915. In Egypt additional training occurred at the Mena Camp. Subsequent embarkations of reinforcements occurred as and when sufficient recruits were gathered and prepared for movement to a war theatre.
Disbandment.
The Brigade was disbanded at Kantara, July 1919 when the various regiments within the Brigade embarked for Australia. As each Regiment arrived at its specific home port, it was disbanded.

Rolandic epilepsy

Benign rolandic epilepsy or benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) is the most common epilepsy syndrome in childhood. Most children will outgrow the syndrome (it starts around the age of 3-13 with a peak around 8–9 years and stops around age 14-18), hence the label benign. The seizures, sometimes referred to as "sylvian seizures", start around the central sulcus of the brain (also called the centrotemporal area, located around the Rolandic fissure, after Luigi Rolando).
Signs and symptoms.
The cardinal features of rolandic epilesy are infrequent, often single, focal seizures consisting of:
Hemifacial sensorimotor seizures are often entirely localised in the lower lip or spread to the ipsilateral hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of clonic contractions, usually lasting from a few seconds to a minute. Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly in the corner of the mouth.
Hemifacial seizures are often associated with an inability to speak and hypersalivation:
"The left side of my mouth felt numb and started jerking and pulling to the left, and I could not speak to say what was happening to me."
Negative myoclonus can be observed in some cases, as an interruption of tonic muscular activity
Oropharyngolaryngeal ictal manifestations are unilateral sensorimotor symptoms inside the mouth. Numbness, and more commonly paraesthesias (tingling, prickling, freezing), are usually diffuse on one side or, exceptionally, may be highly localised even to one tooth. Motor oropharyngolaryngeal symptoms produce strange sounds, such as death rattle, gargling, grunting and guttural sounds, and combinations:
"In his sleep, he was making guttural noises, with his mouth pulled to the right, ‘as if he was chewing his tongue’". "We heard her making strange noises ‘like roaring’ and found her unresponsive, head raised from the pillow, eyes wide open, rivers of saliva coming out of her mouth, rigid."
Arrest of speech is a form of anarthria. The child is unable to utter a single intelligible word and attempts to communicate with gestures. 
"My mouth opened and I could not speak. I wanted to say I cannot speak. At the same time, it was as if somebody was strangling me."
Hypersalivation , a prominent autonomic manifestation, is often associated with hemifacial seizures, oro-pharyngo-laryngeal symptoms and speech arrest. Hypersalivation is not just frothing:
"Suddenly my mouth is full of saliva, it runs out like a river and I cannot speak."
Syncope-like epileptic seizures may occur, probably as a concurrent symptom of Panayiotopoulos syndrome:
"She lies there, unconscious with no movements, no convulsions, like a wax work, no life."
Consciousness and recollection are fully retained in more than half (58%) of rolandic seizures. 
"I felt that air was forced into my mouth, I could not speak and I could not close my mouth. I could understand well everything said to me. Other times I feel that there is food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak."
In the remainder (42%), consciousness becomes impaired during the ictal progress and in one third there is no recollection of ictal events.
Progression to hemiconvulsions or generalised tonic–clonic seizures occurs in around half of children and hemiconvulsions may be followed by postictal Todd’s hemiparesis .
Duration and circadian distribution: Rolandic seizures are usually brief, lasting for 1–3 min. Three ­quarters of seizures occur during non­rapid eye movement sleep, mainly at sleep onset or just before awakening.
Status epilepticus: Although rare, focal motor status or hemiconvulsive status epilepticus is more likely to occur than secondarily generalised convulsive status epilepticus, which is exceptional. Opercular status epilepticus usually occurs in children with atypical evolution or may be induced by carbamazepine or lamotrigine. This state lasts for hours to months and consists of ongoing unilateral or bilateral contractions of the mouth, tongue or eyelids, positive or negative subtle perioral or other myoclonus, dysarthria, speech arrest, difficulties in swallowing, buccofacial apraxia and hypersalivation. These are often associated with continuous spikes and waves on an EEG during NREM sleep.
Other seizure types: Despite prominent hypersalivation, focal seizures with primarily autonomic manifestations autonomic seizures are not considered part of the core clinical syndrome of rolandic epilepsy. However, some children may present with independent autonomic seizures or seizures with mixed rolandic- autonomic manifestations including emesis as in Panayiotopoulos syndrome 
Atypical forms: Rolandic epilepsy may present with atypical manifestations such early age at onset, developmental delay or learning difficulties at inclusion, other seizure types, atypical EEG abnormalities.
These children usually have normal intelligence and development. Learning can remain unimpaired while a child is afflicted with Rolandic epilepsy.
Cause.
Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is thought to be a genetic disorder. An autosomal dominant inheritance with age dependency and variable penetrance has been reported, although not all studies support this theory. Linkage studies have pointed to a possible susceptibility region on chromosome 15q14, in the vicinity of the alpha-7 subunit of theacetylcholine receptor. Most studies show a slight male predominance. Because of the benign course and age-specific occurrence, it is thought to represent a hereditary impairment of brain maturation.
An association with ELP4 has been identified.
Diagnosis.
The diagnosis can be confirmed when the characteristic centrotemporal spikes are seen on electroencephalography (EEG). Typically, high-voltage spikes followed by slow waves are seen. Given the nocturnal activity, a sleep EEG can often be helpful. Technically, the label "benign" can only be confirmed if the child's development continues to be normal during follow-up. Neuroimaging, usually with an MRI scan, is only advised for cases with atypical presentation or atypical findings on clinical examination or EEG.
The disorder should be differentiated from several other conditions, especially centrotemporal spikes without seizures, centrotemporal spikes with local brain pathology, central spikes in Rett syndrome and fragile X syndrome, malignant rolandic epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy and Landau-Kleffner syndrome.
Treatment.
Given the benign nature of the condition and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child and his or her family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.
Parental education about rolandic epilepsy is the cornerstone of correct management. The traumatizing, sometimes long-lasting effect on parents is significant.
Prognosis.
The prognosis for rolandic seizures is invariably excellent, with probably less than 2% risk of developing absence seizures and less often GTCS in adult life. 
Remission usually occurs within 2–4 years from onset and before the age of 16 years. The total number of seizures is low, the majority of patients having fewer than 10 seizures; 10–20% have just a single seizure. About 10–20% may have frequent seizures, but these also remit with age. 
Children with rolandic seizures may develop usually mild and reversible linguistic, cognitive and behavioural abnormalities during the active phase of the disease. These may be worse in children with onset of seizures before 8 years of age, high rate of occurrence and multifocal EEG spikes.
The development, social adaptation and occupations of adults with a previous history of rolandic seizures were found normal.
Epidemiology.
The age of onset ranges from 1 to 14 years with 75% starting between 7–10 years. There is a 1.5 male predominance, prevalence is around 15% in children aged 1–15 years with non-febrile seizures and incidence is 10–20/100,000 of children aged 0–15 years

Clay T. Whitehead

Clay T. "Tom" Whitehead (November 13, 1938 – July 23, 2008 ) was a United States government official who served as director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy from 1970 to 1974, during the Nixon administration. He pioneered a policy of competition in the telecommunications industries, which later was reflected in legislation and regulations in the United States and around the world.
Early life.
Whitehead was born in Neodesha, Kansas, the eldest of four children of Clay and Helen Hinton Whitehead. 
As a young boy, be was interested in telecommunications, spending hours on his ham radio talking to amateur radio operators around the world.
He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his undergraduate and master's degrees in electrical engineering, in 1960 and 1961 respectively, and a Ph.D. in management in 1967.
Before joining the Nixon campaign in 1968 as an expert on budget policies, Whitehead was a RAND Corporation economist and defense analyst.
The White House Years.
Between 1969 and 1970, Whitehead served as Special Assistant to President Richard Nixon. In this capacity, he crafted the “Open Skies” domestic satellite policy that allowed any qualified private company to launch communications satellites, thereby rejecting the monopoly model for the technology.
The policy enabled cable television networks including C-SPAN, CNN, and HBO to prosper and created a ripple effect that ultimately led to sweeping and lasting changes in the telecommunications landscape. 
In 1970, Whitehead led the effort to create the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP), which he announced at a White House Press conference on January 23, 1970. Having tried to recruit heads for the new office, and finding none that fit the description he had in mind, he took the job himself and was confirmed by the U. S. Senate in 1970. Brian Lamb was an assistant. He resigned in 1974.
One of OTP’s accomplishments included ending the regulatory freeze on the infant cable industry, which then permitted it to compete with television broadcasting and, eventually, the established telephone industry. 
Whitehead’s policies also impacted broadcasting directly. “He was credited with formulating policies that gave more autonomy to local stations in the public broadcasting system, which was seen by some PBS executives as an attack on the service in large part because of Dr. Whitehead's early reputation for antagonizing the press.” 
In a noted 1972 speech, Whitehead used the terms "elitist gossip" and "ideological plugola" to echo the Nixon administration's claims of liberal bias in network news. Walter Cronkite claims in his memoir that Whitehead suggested to affiliate stations that they need not carry network news reports such as Cronkite's, and instead could rely on wire dispatches. 
In the spring of 1974, Whitehead secretly organized and led the effort, including Jonathan Moore, assistant to Attorney General Elliott Richardson; Brian Lamb, a journalist; and Laurence Lynn, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Policy, Health Education and Welfare, to plan Vice President Ford's transition to the Presidency.
Post-government Appointments.
After leaving government, Dr. Whitehead was a Visiting Fellow at Harvard University and MIT.
Whitehead joined Hughes Aircraft and started the Hughes Communications subsidiary that launched the Galaxy satellite system, one of the first geostationary satellites. The Galaxy business became the model for satellite television distribution and broadcasting around the world.
Whitehead left Hughes in 1983 and founded Société Européenne des Satellites (SES S.A.), the first private satellite business in Europe, which was based in Luxembourg. SES replaced government-run television and grew tremendously to become one of the continent’s most profitable satellite systems.
In 2005, Whitehead was a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Communications Policy at George Mason University School of Law in Virginia.
During this time, he was also president of Clay Whitehead Associates, an international business development company working primarily in the telecom and television industries.
Honors.
In 2005, Whitehead was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Society of Satellite Professionals International.
In February 2009, The Commonwealth of Virginia passed a house and senate resolution, mourning Whitehead's death and celebrating his life achievements.
Death.
Dr. Whitehead died of prostate cancer in Washington D.C. on July 23, 2008. He was 69 and lived in McLean, Virginia. In 1973, he had married Margaret Mahon. He was survived by his wife, a son, Clay, a daughter, Abigail Craine, and three sisters, Susan and Nancy Whitehead, and Helen Conerly. In 2013 his papers were donated to the library of Congress.

Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's

"Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack's" (2001) 69 NSWLR 558 was an Australian court case decided in the New South Wales Court of Appeal on 21 June 2001, concerning a dispute between United States-based fast food chain Burger King, and its Australian franchisee Hungry Jack's. It related to the breach of a business development agreement between the two companies, and the resulting attempts of Burger King to terminate the contract. The Court of Appeal decided that Burger King could not terminate the contract, for several reasons, one of which was that it was in breach of an implied term of good faith, having taken steps to engineer the breach of the contract.
The case is significant in Australian contract law as one of the most expansive characterisations yet of an implied term of good faith, particularly as it operates to limit parties exercising their contractual rights.
Background to the case.
Hungry Jack's became the Australian franchisee of Burger King in 1971, and by 1996 it was the largest franchisee outside the United States, operating 150 restaurants directly and a further 18 through third-party franchisees. From the 1980s onwards, Burger King had increased its interest in the operations of Hungry Jack's, leading to a number of disputes which prompted alterations to the franchise agreements in 1986, 1989, and again late in 1990 with the completion of four new agreements relating to different aspects of Hungry Jack's activities.
One of these four agreements was the Development Agreement, clause 2.1 of which required Hungry Jack's to open four new stores each year in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland either directly or through third-party franchisees. Additionally, clause 4.1 made the opening of any new restaurants subject to Burger King's operational and financial approval.
Several more disputes arose between the parties in the early 1990s, revolving around Burger King's desire to enter the Australian market directly. In 1992 Burger King considered buying out Hungry Jack's and its stores, either itself, through a third party or through a joint venture, but Hungry Jack's rejected these proposals. In 1993 Burger King commenced negotiations with Shell to open Burger King outlets in some of Shell's service stations — initially including but later excluding Hungry Jack's from the discussions — which culminated in the opening of seven outlets from 1995. During this time a senior Hungry Jack's executive was leaking secret information to Burger King about Hungry Jack's internal operations, and advising Burger King of methods it might employ to force Hungry Jack's to sell out its business to Burger King.
The disputes came to a head in 1995, when Burger King withdrew all approval for third-party franchisees, and stopped granting financial or operating approval to proposed new stores, which meant that Hungry Jack's was unable to open four restaurants per year, as required by clause 2.1 of the Development Agreement. Furthermore, in 1996, a number of stores' franchise agreements expired, and while Burger King renegotiated the agreements, the new agreements made future renewals subject to Burger King's approval, rather than providing for a right to renew; following this, Burger King announced that it would not renew any of these store franchises once they expired.
In November 1996, Burger King purported to terminate the agreement between itself and Hungry Jacks, on the basis that Hungry Jack's had not opened the required number of stores. Hungry Jack's then sued Burger King, alleging that Burger King had no right to terminate the agreement, and also challenging the validity of the new extension agreements. Hungry Jack's was successful at trial, the trial judge finding that there had been breaches of contract and breaches of fiduciary duty on Burger King's part, and awarding Hungry Jack's nearly $AU 71 million in damages. Burger King appealed against the decision.
Arguments.
Clause 2.1.
Hungry Jack's argued that its failure to comply with clause 2.1 did not give Burger King a right to terminate the agreement. Clause 8.1 of the agreement provided that the franchise fees normally payable by Hungry Jack's would be waived if the development schedule were complied with (that is, if Hungry Jack's opened the required number of stores), and further provided that, even if Hungry Jack's failed to comply, it would have a 12 month grace period to remedy the failure and still avoid the franchise fees. Hungry Jack's argued that this meant Burger King would not have a right to terminate until the grace period expired, or else it would lose its opportunity to remedy the failure to comply. Burger King argued that clause 15.1(d) — which allowed it to terminate the agreement if any of the conditions were breached — was worded broadly enough that any breach would activate it, and that clause 8.1 only operated if it chose not to terminate the agreement.
Burger King alternatively argued that even if it had no right to terminate under clause 15.1(d), it had a right to terminate for a breach of clause 2.1 on ordinary principles of contract law, because clause 2.1 was an essential term of the contract. It argued that terms in commercial contracts setting out the time for performance are usually considered essential terms.
Good faith.
Hungry Jack's also argued that the Development Agreement included an implied term of good faith (that is, that the parties must act in good faith when exercising their rights under the contract), and that Burger King had breached this term by denying the financial and operating approval to new restaurants, leading to Hungry Jack's failing to meet the minimum stores requirement. As a result of this breach of good faith, it argued, Burger King could not successfully terminate the contract.
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal delivered a unanimous judgment, dismissing the appeal. They found that Burger King had no right to terminate the contract, whether under clause 15.1(d) of the agreement, or under general principles of contract law, and further found that Burger King had breached an implied term of good faith.
Clause 2.1.
The court first considered clause 2.1 in the Development Agreement. They noted that, while on its face it seemed to create in Burger King a right to terminate in the event of non-compliance by Hungry Jack's, it was actually subject to a number of qualifications, and that there were other procedures within the agreement for dealing with situations of non-compliance. The court disagreed with Burger King's broad reading of the consequences of a breach of clause 2.1, concluding that such an interpretation would mean that Hungry Jack's could not take advantage of the grace period, and that a narrower view should be preferred. Accordingly, they found that since Burger King had not allowed the 12 month grace period to expire, its termination was not effective.
The court then considered whether clause 2.1 was an essential term, breach of which would allow Burger King to terminate the contract on the basis of ordinary principles of contract law. It considered a number of other clauses which provided for various procedures if clause 2.1 were not complied with (including the grace period in clause 8.1), and held that clause 2.1 could not be considered an essential term, as it could not be said that Burger King would not have entered the contract without being assured of strict compliance with it.
The court thus found that Burger King had no right to terminate the contract for Hungry Jack's breach of 2.1, either under the contract or under the common law.
Good faith.
In considering whether an implied term of good faith (along with an implied term of reasonableness) was included in the contract, the court first discussed past New South Wales cases on the point, in which terms of good faith had been implied into the relevant contracts, particularly "Renard Constructions v Minister for Public Works". In that case, Priestley JA had considered the status of implied terms of good faith in United States contract law — particularly via an examination of the Second Restatement of Contracts — where requirements of good faith are not only well-entrenched but often incorporated into contracts by way of legislation. The court also examined the recognition of good faith in other Australian jurisdictions.
The court found that a requirement of good faith may well be implied in all commercial contracts, particularly in standard form contracts. However, it also considered that the contract in this case did not fall into any of the traditional categories of contracts where such terms are often implied. The court held that in these circumstances, it is necessary to consider whether the requirement of good faith is both reasonable and necessary in determining whether it should be implied into the contract. In this case, the court said that the term was reasonable and necessary, since otherwise Burger King would be able to deny approval for new stores "capriciously, or with the sole intent of engineering a default of the Development Agreement".
In terms of the meaning of good faith, the court considered that there was no "distinction of substance" between an obligation to act in good faith and an obligation to act reasonably. It further said that, while parties to a contract are allowed to pursue their own legitimate commercial interests within the framework of a contract, to do so for a purpose extraneous to the contract would be a breach of good faith.
The court held that Burger King's actions in denying financial and operating approval for new restaurants were not the legitimate pursuit of interests under the Development Agreement, but were rather efforts to harm or hinder Hungry Jack's.
Consequences.
Burger King subsequently sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, which was granted. However, the appeal was subsequently disposed of after the parties mutually consented to orders.
The case has been recognised as one among several cases indicating that " duty of good faith in the performance of contracts is on the agenda of Australian contract law". Horrigan identified the case as one of a number of cases in which New South Wales courts were leading the way in terms of good faith in Australian contract law, while noting that the idea has yet to catch on extensively in other jurisdictions, identifying good faith as one of the important unresolved areas of "fairness-based business regulation".
To the extent that the decision represents a trend towards treating good faith as an implied term in many contracts, or possibly even a universal term, it has been criticised in a number of ways.
Adrian Baron has argued that the implication of a term of good faith runs contrary to basic principles of contract law, because it tends to disregard the reality that (at least in commercial contexts) parties to a contract "pursue their own commercial interests, and enter into terms that reflect the risks and benefits that each party is prepared to bear". Baron argued that in 1990, when the parties entered the Development Agreement, "it would have been plain to Hungry Jack's that if certain events occurred, Burger King could, at its option, terminate the agreement", and that the contract sufficiently identified the circumstances warranting termination of the contract, with the result that "he appendage of a requirement of reasonableness and good faith by the court to the agreement was inconsistent with the bargain freely entered into by the parties."
Carter and Peden have argued that the case, along with "Renard Constructions", introduced a number of "unexplained anomalies in the law of termination clauses", including creating inconsistencies with other precedents relating to powers of sale and equitable limitations on challenging the termination of sale of land contracts. Carter and Peden further argued that an implied good faith term is unnecessary, because basic contract principles already account for it, and it can only serve to introduce inconsistencies, stating that "seems clear that there are some who see Australian contract law as the 'poor relation' in comparison with other jurisdictions when it comes to good faith" and that "[a term of good faith is then implied almost by way of apology to the parties."
This case was one of a number of cases relied on in argument before the High Court of Australia in the case of "Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council", however the court dealt with the dispute without needing to consider the issue, "technically reservfor another day [their conclusive response" to the question of implied terms of good faith. , the case has yet to be considered in any other High Court cases.

Patna

Patna () is the capital of the Indian state of Bihar, its most populous city and the second most populous city in Eastern India after Kolkata. It is the administrative, industrial and educational centre of the state. Patna is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world. Ancient Patna, known as Pataliputra, was the capital of the Magadha Empire under the Haryanka, Nanda, Mauryan, Sunga, Gupta and Pala.
Pataliputra was a seat of learning and fine arts. Its population during the Maurya period (around 300 BCE) was about 400,000.
The modern city of Patna is situated on the southern bank of the Ganges. The city also straddles the rivers Sone, Gandak and Punpun. The city is approximately 35 km long and 16 km to 18 km wide.
In June 2009, the World Bank ranked Patna second in India (after Delhi) for ease of starting a business. As of 2010-2011, Patna had the highest per capita gross district domestic product in Bihar, at 57,843. Using figures for assumed average annual growth, Patna is the 21st fastest growing city in the world and 5th fastest growing city in India by the City Mayors' Foundation. Patna registered an average annual growth of 3.72% during 2006-2010.
The Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain pilgrim centres of Vaishali, Rajgir, Nalanda, Gaya, Bodhgaya, and Pawapuri are nearby and Patna is also a sacred city for Sikhs as the last Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, was born here.
History.
Origin of name.
The name of this city changed with time. There are several theories regarding the source of the modern name Patna (Devanagari:पटना) :
Legend describes the origin of Patna to a mythological King Putraka who created Patna by magic for his queen Patali, literally "trumpet flower", which gives it its ancient name Pataligrama. It is said that in honour of the queen's first-born, the city was named Pataliputra. "Gram" is Sanskrit for village and "Putra" means son. Legend also says that the Emerald Buddha was created in Patna (then Pataliputra) by Nagasena in 43 BCE.
Medieval era.
Patna became significant around the year 490 BCE when Ajatashatru, the king of Magadha, wanted to shift his capital from the hilly Rajagrha to a more strategically located place to combat the Licchavis of Vaishali. He chose the site on the bank of the Ganges and fortified the area. Gautama Buddha passed through this place in the last year of his life. He prophesied a great future for this place, but at the same time, he predicted its ruin from flood, fire and feud.
Mauryan empire.
Megasthenes, the Indo-Greek historian and ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya, gave one of the earliest account of the city. He wrote that the city was situated on the confluence of the rivers "Ganga" and "Arennovoas" (Sonabhadra — Hiranyawah) and was long and wide. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to India, described the city as the greatest city on earth during its heyday. The Sungas ultimately retained control of Pataliputra and ruled for almost 100 years. The Sungas were then followed by the Kanvas and eventually the Guptas.
A number of Chinese travellers came to India in pursuit of knowledge and recorded their observations about Pataliputra in their travelogues, including those of a Chinese Buddhist Fa Hien, who visited India between 399 and 414 CE, and stayed here for many months translating Buddhist texts.
Gupta and Mughal empires.
In the years that followed, many dynasties ruled the Indian subcontinent from the city, including those of the Gupta empire and the Pala kings. With the disintegration of the Gupta empire, Patna passed through uncertain times. Bakhtiar Khilji captured Bihar in the 12th century and destroyed many ancient seats of learning, and Patna lost its prestige as the political and cultural center of India.
Guru Gobind Singh (22 December 1666 – 7 October 1708), the tenth Guru of the Sikhs, was born as Gobind Rai in Patna to Teg Bahadur, the ninth Guru of the Sikhs, and his wife Gujri. His birthplace, Patna Sahib, is one of the most sacred pilgrimages for Sikhs.
The Mughal period was a period of unremarkable provincial administration from Delhi. The most remarkable period during these times was under the Pashtun emperor Sher Shah Suri, who revived Patna in the middle of the 16th century. He built a fort and founded a town on the banks of the Ganges. Sher Shah's fort in Patna does not survive, although the Sher Shah Suri Masjid mosque, built in Afghan architectural style, does. Mughal emperor Akbar came to Patna in 1574 to crush the Afgha Chief Daud Khan. Akbar's navratna and state's official historian and author of "Ain-i-Akbari" Abul Fazl refers to Patna as a flourishing centre for paper, stone and glass industries. He also refers to the high quality of numerous strains of rice grown in Patna, famous as Patna rice in Europe.
By 1620, the city of Patna was being described as the "chefest mart towne of all Bengala" (i.e. largest town in Bengal) in northern India, "the largest town in Bengal and the most famous for trade". This was before the founding of the city of Calcutta. Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb acceded to the request of his favourite grandson, Prince Muhammad Azim, to rename Patna as Azimabad, in 1704 while Azim was in Patna as the subedar. However, very little changed during this period other than the name. With the decline of the Mughal empire, Patna moved into the hands of the Nawabs of Bengal, who levied a heavy tax on the populace but allowed it to flourish as a commercial centre. The mansions of the Maharaja of Tekari Raj dominated the Patna river front in 1811-12.
British empire.
During the 17th century, Patna became a centre of international trade. In 1620, the English East India Company established a factory in Patna for trading in calico and silk. Soon this became a trading centre for saltpetre. Francois Bernier, in "Travels in the Mogul Empire" (1656–1668), says "...a prodigious quantity of saltpetre was imported from Patna. It was carried down the Ganges with great facility, and the Dutch and English send large cargoes to many parts of the Indies, and to Europe". This trade encouraged other Europeans, principally the French, Danes, Dutch and Portuguese, to compete in the lucrative business. Peter Mundy, writing in 1632, described Patna as "the greatest mart of the eastern region". After the decisive Battle of Buxar of 1764, Patna fell into the hands of the East India Company, which installed a government. It was ruled during the years of British India by a series of governors, including Rahul Gunderjaharagand.
In 1912, when the Bengal Presidency was partitioned, Patna became the capital of the British province of Bihar and Orissa, although in 1935 Orissa became a separate entity with its own capital.
Indian independence movement.
People from Patna were involved in the Indian independence movement. Most notable were the Champaran movement against the Indigo plantation and the 1942 Quit India Movement. National leaders who have come from the city include Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, the first President of the Constituent Assembly of India; Dr. Sachidanand Sinha; Dr. Rajendra Prasad; "Bihar Vibhuti" (Anugrah Narayan Sinha); Basawon Singh (Sinha); "Loknayak" (Jayaprakash Narayan); Sri Krishna Sinha; Sheel Bhadra Yajee and Sarangdhar Sinha (Singh)
Patna continued to be the capital of the state of Bihar after independence in 1947, though Bihar itself was partitioned again in 2000 when Jharkhand became a separate state of the Indian union.

Music video.
A fashion show is happening but the audience is very bored. Backstage, the fashion director is helping one of the women in the show with her outfit. They both smell something, and Crazy Loop comes in wearing a pizza delivery outfit, delivering a pizza. The woman tries to get a taste, but the fashion director forbids her and tries the pizza himself. However, the director dislikes it and spits it in the trash. 
Several women in the show head for the runway, including the director who forbids Crazy Loop to enter. With no one around, Crazy Loop tries on a suit and a pair of sunglasses, walks to the runway and dances in front of the women in the show. The bored audience then wakes up and stare at him. The director is angry at Crazy Loop and glares at him, even trying to get a woman to kick Crazy Loop out of the show (which goes unsuccessfully). A VIP comes and watches Crazy Loop. At first it appears like he is going to give a thumbs down, causing the director to panic; however, the VIP ends up giving the thumbs up. The fashion show turns crazy (like Crazy Loop), and all the people in the show (including the director) try on crazy outfits (one involving the pizza Crazy Loop delivered). The audience eats the pizza the director earlier rejected. The director then offers Crazy Loop a popcorn basket, and Crazy Loop throws it in the air. With pizza being eaten, popcorn in the air, and guests happy and content, the fashion show is featured on the cover on magazines as a huge success.
Drag-queen Tammie Brown, known for participating in "RuPaul's Drag Race" makes a cameo appearance in the video.

Porky and his dog Mandrake are hunting for a groundhog as well. Mandrake's first searching attempt only has him retrieve a boot. While Mandrake lingers in the woods, Grover gives him a fright. Mandrake recognises Grover as a groundhog and begins chasing him (even after Grover bribes him). Grover starts scolding Mandrake and making a sad story. This makes Mandrake oppose Porky's hunting, until Porky snaps him out of it. Before resuming the chase, Porky's dons a pair of earmuffs on Mandrake, but Grover tells another sad story through a microphone into the earmuffs. As Porky scolds Mandrake, the dog pretends to commit suicide with a water pistol. Porky gives Mandrake a final chance to catch the groundhog. Grover tricks Mandrake into eating a bone so that Porky thinks he ate the groundhog. As Porky confronts Mandrake, Grover whispers a sad story to pass on to Mandrake. Mandrake snaps Porky out of his tears and Grover runs off. All three of them rush into Grover's home and switch their fighting into shadow boxing.

Plastic Igniter Cord

A plastic igniter cord (PIC) is a type of fuse used to initiate an explosive device or charge. In appearance igniter cord is similar to safety fuse and when ignited, an intense flame spits perpendicular to the cord at a uniform rate as it burns along its length. Igniter cord in construction is again similar to safety fuse, consisting of a pyrotechnic composition at the core, wrapped with a nylon sheath to provide shape and finally wrapped again in an outer plastic shell to provide water resistance. Normally, igniter cord also consists of a metal wire at the very center of the pyrotechnic core which also runs the entire length of the cord; the pyrotechnic composition will react with the metal wire (typically aluminum, iron or copper) to increase the energetics of the fuse. There are two types of PICs: the fast type which has nominal burning speed of 30 cm per second, a diameter of about 3 mm, and is brownish in color; and the slow type, which has a diameter of 2 mm, is greenish in color, and has a nominal burning speed of 3 cm per second.

Kampfgeschwader 53

Kampfgeschwader 53 "Legion Condor" (English: "Condor Legion") (KG 53) was a Luftwaffe bomber wing during World War II.
Its units participated on all of the fronts in the European Theatre until it was disbanded in May 1945. It operated three of the major German bomber types: the Dornier Do 17, Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88.
History.
"Kampfgeschwader 53" was formed on 1 May 1939 at Ansbach, Germany with "Stab"./KG 53, I "Gruppe", II "Gruppe" and III "Gruppe".
Wartime service.
Poland.
The Geschwader was initially put on "standby" in western Germany, in case of an Allied offensive. As a result, most of its "Gruppen" did not see action in the campaign. I./KG 53 was put under the command of "Luftflotte 1". It had a strength of 31 He 111s, all serviceable. It was committed from the first day, but on 6 September it was moved to "Luftflotte 4". The "Gruppe" lost only 1 aircraft in the campaign.
Denmark and Norway.
The "Geschwader" undertook training during the campaign, and did not take part in the battle.
France and the Low Countries.
I./KG 53 flew support missions against supply and rail targets in the Reims area. Later targets in Abbeville, Amiens, Rouen and Arras were attacked. I./KG 53 recorded zero losses in the first two days. II./KG had 36 He 111s on strength and participated at the Sedan breakthrough, attacking targets around Lille, and supported I./KG 53.
Battle of Britain.
Assigned to "Luftflotte 2" I./KG 54 was relocated to Wevelgem, Belgium on 1 July 1940. It carried out operations over Britain until 11 May. It remained inactive until 18 June when it was withdrawn to Poland.
II./KG 53 continued until the same date. Its targets included night attacks against RAF Fighter Commands airfields, most in East Anglia. It took part in the heavy air fighting on the 18 August 1940, dubbed, "The Hardest Day". III./KG 53 continued to support the other "Gruppen", all of which were involved in the 15 September raid, known as the Battle of Britain Day.
Eastern Front.
The Geschwader supported the operations of Army Group Centre in the initial phase of the war in the east. It participated in the Battle of Białystok-Minsk, Battle of Brody, Battle of Kiev and Battle of Smolensk. It supported the push to capture Moscow, which resulted in the failed Battle of Moscow. It was withdrawn to Germany to rest in December 1941– January 1942.
KG 53 supported "Fall Blau" and the German Sixth Army at the Battle of Stalingrad, and took part in the desperate resupply operation after the Russian counteroffensive had encircled the Sixth Army.
Attacks were also carried out in northern Russia, against Leningrad. Strategic bombing attacks were also conducted against Gorki in June 1943, aimed at the Tank factory at "Gorkovskiy Avtomobilniy". All of GAZ No. 1 plants 50 buildings, 9,000 metres of conveyors, 5,900 units of equipment and 8,000 tank engines were destroyed.
The "Kampfgeschwader" supported "Operation Citadel", and the subsequent Battle of Kursk. 
On 14 October 1943 the unit took part in a short strategic bombing campaign in Russia. USAAF formations had been flying shuttle missions to Soviet territory after bombing German targets. The operation, named "Zaunkönig", struck at American airfields in Russia, as well as Soviet targets. KG 53 and KG 55 took part in the attack. The Russians failed to defend these aircraft from Luftwaffe attacks and the bombing destroyed some 44 B-17 bombers and damaged 26 others. Another 15 fighters were also destroyed. However, the Soviets began Operation Bagration soon after, and the "Kampfgeschwaders" switched back to supporting ground forces.
Most of the units "Gruppes" were disbanded by October 1944. It appears that the last unit, 14.(Eis)/KG 3 was disbanded on 4 March 1945; its remaining personnel went to KG 76.
Western Front.
KG 53 was withdrawn from the Eastern Front in August 1944 and soon after began operations over Britain, flying He 111H-22 bombers outfitted to air launch V-1 flying bombs . Operations were suspended on 25 January 1945, due to fuel shortages, Allied defences and the inability to see the results.

<doc id="18691549" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18691549" title="Naukane">
Naukane

Naukane (ca. 1779 - February 2, 1850), also known as John Coxe, Edward Cox, and Coxe was a Native Hawaiian chief who traveled widely through North America in the early 19th century. He was either considered a member of the royal household of Kamehameha I or a chiefly retainer, possibly the same person as Noukana, the son of High Chief Kamanawa, the King's uncle and trusted advisor.
In 1811 the"Tonquin", belonging to the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC), stopped on Oahu and recruited twenty Hawaiians to work as labourers (known as kanakas) in the Pacific Northwest. King Kamehameha I appointed Naukane to join the group and look after the interests of Hawaiian laborers.
On the voyage to Fort Astoria on the Columbia River Naukane was given the name John Coxe, because he resembled a shipmate on the "Tonquin".
Soon after Naukane arrived at Fort Astoria David Thompson of the Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) also arrived. In July, 1811, Thompson and a group of Astorians began to journey up the Columbia River. The two parties traveled together until they reached the Columbia Gorge, after which Thompson went on ahead. Before parting ways there was an exchange of some of the workers. Thompson allowed his employee Michel Boulard to join the Pacific Fur Company in exchange for Naukane, who Thompson referred to as Coxe. Boulard was a 40 year old voyageur who had worked with Thompson off and on for the previous eleven years. Boulard, although weaker with age, was useful to the Astorians for his great knowledge of geography and native affairs. In contrast, Naukane was valuable to Thompson for his great strength. Naukane traveled with Thompson as far as Spokane House. There he was left with Jaco Finlay while Thompson continued rapidly on. Soon Naukane was traveling east as well, crossing the continent to Fort William (today's Thunder Bay, Ontario) on Lake Superior. From there he traveled by water to Quebec. In 1812 the ship "Isaac Todd" took him to England. In 1813 he returned to the Pacific Northwest on the British warship HMS "Racoon".
After the demise of the Pacific Fur Company during the War of 1812 in August 1814, Naukane returned to the Hawaiian Islands in 1815. He soon returned to the Pacific Northwest as an employee of the North West Company. He worked as a labourer at Fort Georgia (the name of Fort Astoria under the NWC). When the company was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1821, Naukane remained at Fort George as an HBC employee. In 1823 he was sent with King Kamehameha II to England to visit King George IV. He spent most of the rest of his life near Fort Vancouver, working for the HBC. He had a wife in 1825 and appears to have had a Native slave, Marie, whom he likely inherited through a previous Native wife. He appears to have retired in 1843 or 1844 and probably continued to live in Kanaka Village at Fort Vancouver. He died on February 2, 1850, at Fort Vancouver.

I Can Feel You

"I Can Feel You" is a song by American pop singer-songwriter Anastacia from her fourth studio album, "Heavy Rotation" (2008). The track was released in Europe on October 10, 2008 and in the United Kingdom on October 13, 2008 as the album's lead single. The worldwide premiere was in the UK on BBC Radio 2 on August 21, 2008.
Critical reception.
This song received mixed to negative reviews. Allmusic editor Jon O'Brien didn't like the single release of the song: "Lead single "I Can Feel You" misleadingly suggests that this doesn't seem like a particularly wise decision. Written by man of the moment Ne-Yo, its promising opening funky beats and squelchy synths are let down by such a non-event of a chorus that it's hard to believe it's penned by the same man behind Rihanna's recent infectious chart hits. A prime example of using a star name just for the sake of it, it's arguably the most underwhelming comeback song of the year." Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy in album review wrote "Make Anastacia relevant to the generation brought up on Amy Winehouse and Pussycat Dolls rather than Mariah and Whitney. The low-key disco" of lead single "I Can Feel You" decent indication of Anastacia's intentions." He also compared the song to that time recent Britney Spears singles. Nick Levine of Digital Spy reviewed the single: "Sadly, 'I Can Feel You' isn't the big comeback single she needs after what in pop terms is a fairly lengthy hiatus. It begins promisingly with a lightly funky disco groove, but the chorus lacks the oomph that turned 'Left Outside Alone' and 'I'm Outta Love' into radio favourites." and gave it 2 out of 5 stars. Ian Gittins of Virgin Media praised vocal performance: "Her asbestos larynx is in full effect on Heavy Rotation, rasping through R&B-hued lead-off single "I Can Feel You." 
Music video.
The music video had its official premiere on September 14, 2008. Directed by Chris Applebaum and filmed in Los Angeles, the video consists of Anastacia in four different settings, having no real concept. The first is Anastacia in a smoky alley wearing a silver dress, dancing and hopping around. The second is Anastacia in black leather pants, laying on a chair, surrounded by green lights. The third setting includes Anastacia fully naked in a bathtub, covering her breasts with her hands and arms. The final setting is Anastacia wearing a second silver dress and a huge feather boa, dancing and singing in front of a wall. These four settings are intertwined with backstage footage of the videoshoot, including footage of Anastacia's husband, sister and her dogs.

Daniele Archibugi

Daniele Archibugi (Rome, July 17, 1958) is an Italian economic and political theorist. He works on the economics and policy of innovation and technological change, on the political theory of international relations and on political and technological globalisation.
Biography.
He has graduated in Economics at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" with Federico Caffè and taken his D.Phil. at SPRU, University of Sussex, under the mentoring of Christopher Freeman and Keith Pavitt. He has worked and taught at the Universities of Sussex, Naples, Cambridge, Sapienza University of Rome, LUISS University of Rome, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto and SWEFE University, Chengdu. He was Leverhulme Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics, and Lauro de Bosis Visiting Professor at Harvard University. In June 2006 he was appointed Honorary Professor at the University of Sussex. He currently works at the Italian National Research Council in Rome and at Birkbeck, University of London.
Cosmopolitan democracy.
Together with David Held, he has been a key figure in the development of cosmopolitanism and of cosmopolitan democracy in particular, namely the attempt to apply some of the norms and values of democracy to global politics. He has advocated substantial reforms in international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union.
He has criticized the G7, G8 and G20 summits as undemocratic and urged for more transparent gathering for global politics. He is among the promoters of a directly elected World Parliament.
Globalization of innovation.
Archibugi developed a taxonomy of the globalization of technology with Jonathan Michie, where they distinguish among three main devices of transmission of know-how: international exploitation of innovations, global generation of innovation and global collaborations in science and technology.
As Chairman of an Expert Group of the European Research Area on international collaboration in science and technology, he has pointed out that the demographic decline in Europe, combined with the lack of vocation of youngesters for hard sciences, will generate a dramatic shortage of qualified workers in less than a generation. This will jeopardize the standard of livings of Europeans in key areas such as medical research, information technologies and knowledge intensive industries. He has urged for substantial revisions to European immigration policy in order to accommodate at least two million qualified students in science, engineering from developing countries in a decade.
