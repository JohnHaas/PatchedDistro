Libertarian pledge

The Libertarian pledge, a statement individuals must sign in order to join the Libertarian Party of the United States, declares, "I hereby certify that I do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of achieving political or social goals." Libertarian Party founder David Nolan created the pledge in 1971. His goal was to convince government authorities that the LP was inherently not a violent organization, during a time when many political groups were using terroristic tactics.
The pledge is required by Section 5.1 of the national bylaws and many state affiliates of the Libertarian Party also have bylaw provisions requiring it. At the 2006 Libertarian National Convention, the Libertarian Reform Caucus attempted to repeal the pledge but failed to obtain the necessary two-thirds vote. There have been many proposals to change or eliminate the pledge.
A reference to the pledge was made on April 17, 2001 when, in response to Timothy McVeigh's description of himself as a libertarian, Libertarian Party national director Steve Dasbach said:

Foxton Inclined Plane Trust

The Foxton Inclined Plane Trust is a waterway society and a registered charity on the Grand Union Canal at Foxton, Leicestershire, England, UK. It was founded in 1980 to promote the restoration of the Victorian boat lift or inclined plane, a unique and famous piece of canal history.
The Trust runs the Foxton Canal Museum which was opened in 1989 and is also the Trust headquarters, in the former boiler house.
It is campaigning for the full restoration of the boat lift, and it is a partner in the Foxton Locks Partnership, composed of British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Old Union Canals Society and local authorities.
The Foxton Locks Partnership has already obtained £ 1.78 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund for preliminary restoration works on the site, including:
The Foxton Inclined Plane was opened in 1900, refurbished between 1909 and 1910, and closed in 1911. It was demolished in 1928.
The Inclined plane is part of a site which includes a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II* listed staircase of locks.

Cab Secure Radio

Cab Secure Radio (CSR) is an in-cab analogue radiotelephone system used on parts of the British railway network. Its main function is to provide a secure speech link between the train driver and the signaller which cannot be overheard by other train drivers. In areas where CSR is used it must be the primary method of communication between driver and signaller, always being used in preference to the signal post telephone. Within the next few years CSR will be replaced by the GSM-R digital system, as it forms the initial phase of rollout of ERTMS throughout the UK.
History.
CSR was first introduced in the Glasgow area in 1986 to enable driver-only operation of trains. It was later used in the London and Liverpool areas.
Use.
The driver initialises the CSR with an area code followed by the identification number of the signal in front of the train. The radio then automatically sends the stock number of the train (e.g., 455112), to the signalling system. The signaller then allocates a train reporting number (e.g., 2M34) to the train. This reporting number is used by the signalling equipment to track the progress of the train as it moves through the rail network.
Each signalling area (or signal panel within a larger signalbox) uses a different radio channel corresponding with an area code. As the train passes from the jurisdiction of one signaller to another, the CSR in the driver's cab changes channel automatically. Lineside signs are provided to inform the driver of where the area code changes. Occasionally the radio may fail to change channel or lose the signal completely, in which case the driver can enter the code manually.
Hardware.
CSR cab equipment can be the Stornophone 6000 or a Siemens model.

Larry Townsend

Larry Townsend (27 October 1930 – 29 July 2008) was the pseudonymous author (né 'Bud' Bernhardt) of dozens of books including "Run Little Leather Boy" (1970) and "The Leatherman’s Handbook" (1972) at pioneer erotic presses such as Greenleaf Classics and the Other Traveler imprint of Olympia Press.
Growing up as a teenager of Swiss-German extraction in Los Angeles a few houses from Noël Coward and Irene Dunne, he ate cookies with his neighbor Laura Hope Crews who was Aunt Pittypat in Gone with the Wind. He attended the prestigious Peddie School, and was stationed as Staff Sergeant in charge of NCOIC Operations of Air Intelligence Squadrons for nearly five years with the US Air Force in Germany (1950–1954). Completing his tour of duty, he entered into the 1950s underground of the then small LA leather scene where he and Montgomery Clift shared a lover. With his degree in industrial psychology from UCLA (1957), he worked in the private sector and as a probation officer with the Forestry Service. He began his pioneering activism in the politics of homophile liberation in the early 1960s. In 1972, as president of the ‘Homophile Effort for Legal Protection’ which had been founded in 1969 to defend gays during and after arrests, he led a group in founding the H.E.L.P. Newsletter, the forebear of "Drummer Magazine" (1975). He lived in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the center of the Los Angeles leather scene (the equivalent of the SoMa neighborhood in San Francisco). As a writer and photographer, he was an essential eyewitness of the drama and salon around "Drummer" in which his novels were often excerpted. His signature “Leather Notebook” column appeared in "Drummer" for twelve years beginning in 1980, and continued in "Honcho" to Spring 2008. His last novel, "TimeMasters", was published April 2008. His last writing was "Who Lit up the Lit of the Golden Age of Drummer" an introduction to "Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer" (June 2008).
His partner of 44 years, Fred Yerkes, passed on July 8, 2006.

History of Polish

The Polish language is a West Slavic language, and thus descends from Proto-Slavic, and more distantly from Proto-Indo-European. More specifically, it is a member of the Lechitic branch of the West Slavic languages, along with other languages spoken in areas within or close to the area of modern Poland, including Kashubian, Silesian, and the extinct Slovincian and Polabian.
The history of the language can be divided into four periods of development: Old Polish, up to the start of the 16th century; Middle Polish, from the 16th century until the end of the 18th century; New Polish, up to 1930; and Modern Polish, since 1930.
This page lists the most important changes that have taken place in the history of the Polish language.
Phonetic processes.
Word stress, initially moving, first was placed on the first syllable, to finally become penultimate.
Changes in grammar.
Declension.
Nouns.
The declension of nouns has become simpler. Now it depends on the gender of a noun (smok, o smoku – foka, o foce) ("a dragon, about a dragon - a seal, about a seal") and to some extend on the hardness of a noun's stem (liść, liście – list, listy)("leaf - leaves, letter - letters"). Two categories have appeared in the masculine gender: the category of animacy and of personhood (but, widzę but, widzę buty – kot, widzę kota, widzę koty – pilot, widzę pilota, widzę pilotów) ("a shoe, I see a shoe, I see shoes - a cat, I see a cat, I see cats - a pilot, I see a pilot, I see pilots").
Traces of consonant stems still remain but almost exclusively in neuter noun stems ending in -en, -ent- (cielę – cielęcia, imię – imienia) ("a calf - of a calf, a name - of a name"). For all other stems, long or short form has become characteristic of all cases. In general, in the past endings characteristic of stems ending in -o-, -jo- and -a-, -ja- were most common. Other endings were disappearing. The endings which did not cause the alteration of the stem were becoming more popular. Traces of the lack of softness in some forms of words softened by front vowels (mainly forms ending with a consonant or ending with -i-, egz. krъvaxъ > *krwach > krwiach) have disappeared. Often softness is the only remnant of old noun endings (Gen. kamane > kamienia) ("of stone").
Singular.
Nominative.
The disappearance of short forms of stems may be interpreted as the result of the introduction of accusative noun form in nominative.
For neuter nouns the ending -ьje sometimes produced a constricted -é (weselé) ("wedding"). Names of institutions such as podkomorzé, due to the influence of names such as łowczy ("hunting"), since the 16th century have been declinated as adjectives: podkomorzy ("chamberlain").
Genitive.
The ending -y has come to be applied to all feminine nouns.
The ending -a has come to be applied to all neuter nouns and to the majority of masculine nouns. In the 16th century, ending -å, in other words non-acute -a, was applied to neuter stems ending in -ьje: oká ("of an eye") but wesela (of a wedding).
After a period of frequent changes (which still has not ended) the ending -u is still applied to some masculine non-personal nouns, but there is no major connection with the original form.
Until the 16th century, the ending -ej, used in the declension of pronouns, was applied to all nouns in genitive and dative and to feminine nouns in the locative if a noun had an old stem ending in -ja-: paniej, rolej, duszej (lord, role, soul).
Dative.
The ending -'e is still applied to feminine nouns with stems ending in -a-.
The ending -y is still applied to feminine soft-stem nouns. Occasionally, in the Old Polish ending -y was applied to neuter nouns with stems ending in a consonant: dziecięci, książęci ("child, prince").
The ending -owi has come to be applied to almost all stems of masculine nouns. Occasionally, it was applied to stems of neuter nouns.
The ending -ewi in the Old Polish was sometimes applied instead of the ending -owi to the soft-stem nouns and in the 15th and 16th century it was also applied to hard-stem nouns.
The ending -u has come to be applied to all stems of neuter nouns. It is still applied to some masculine noun forms ending in -o-, -jo-. Until the 16th century it was used more frequently, especially following the preposition "ku" (człowieku ("human"), głosu ("voice"), ku południu ("towards the south")).
Accusative.
The accusative has remained the same as the nominative for all neuter nouns.
For masculine nouns, the accusative has remained the same as the nominative for inanimate nouns and for animate nouns it has become the same as the genitive. The reason for this last change was most probably the free word order and the ambiguity that it could entail in phrases such as "syn kocha ojciec" (a son /nom./ loves a father /nom./) and "ojciec kocha syn" (a father /nom./ loves a son /nom./). The change of their forms into "syn kocha ojca" (son /nom./ loves father /acc./) and "ojca kocha syn" (father /acc./ loves son /nom./) helped to resolve this ambiguity. The accusative was the same as the nominative until 14th - 15th century (in the region of Mazowsze until 16th century), and nowadays this feature is preserved in common phrases such as "iść za mąż" (to get married), "siąść na koń" (to mount a horse), "na miły Bóg" (dear Lord!), "być za pan brat" (to be on intimate terms with sbd.).
The ending -0 is still applied to stems of feminine nouns for which this same ending is applied also in the nominative.
The ending -ę is still applied to the typically feminine nouns.
In Old Polish the ending -ą was applied instead of -ę to nouns which in the nominative ended with -å "widzę duszę, boginię" (I see a soul, a goddess) but "wolą, pieczą" (will, care). Nowadays, the only remnant of this rule is the accusative form "panią" (lady).
Instrumental.
The ending -ą is still applied to all stems of feminine nouns.
The ending -em has come to be applied to all stems of masculine and neuter nouns. The development of -ъmь, -ьmь has contributed to the stabilization of the use of this ending.
The ending -im < -ьjemь was applied to neuter nouns ending in the old -ьje: "wiesielim, miłosierdzim" (joy, mercy), "wyobrażenim" (imagination).
Locative.
The ending -'e is applied to hard-stem nouns. Until 15th - 16th century it was also applied to masculine and feminine nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch: "Bodze" (god), "gresze" (sin), "mlece" (milk). For noun stems ending in -n-: "We dnie i w nocy" (during the day and night), but in general: "w dniu" (during the day).
The ending -y has come to be applied to all feminine soft-stem nouns. Until 14th - 15th century it was also applied to a very small number of stems ending in -jo-, especially i < -ьji for neuter nouns ending in -ьje.
The ending -u has come to be applied to masculine and neuter hard-stem nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch. It has also survived in forms "o synu, domu" (about a son, about a house) and is also present in the form "o panu" (due to the infuence of the phrase "w Panu Bogu") (in the Lord God).
Vocative.
The ending -'e (with -e, not -ě2, this is why there is the softening connected to the first palatalization) is applied to masculine hard-stem nouns. Until 16th century it was also applied to nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch. Nowadays it is present in forms such as "Boże, człowiecze, Kozacze" (also "człowieku, Kozaku"), and also "księże", additionally after -ec: "ojcze, starcze"(father, old man) (connected with the third palatalization).
The ending -u has come to be applied to masculine soft-stem nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch and also feminine soft-stem nouns known as 'rodzinne' ('family nouns', used when addressing other family members) ("coiciu, Helu") (auntie, Hela). It has also survived in forms such as "synu, domu"! (son, home!).
The ending -o has survived in the old feminine nouns ending in -a- and has also spread onto the majority of old feminine nouns ending in -ja-.
The ending -y is still applied to feminine nouns which stems in the nominative end with a consonant ("myszy, kości"!) (mice, bones!) and has spread onto the nouns of the same type as "pani" (lady).
The forms of neuter nouns in the vocative have remained the same as their forms in the nominative.
Plural.
Nominative.
Until the 15th century the ending -i was the most widely applied ending to the stems of masculine nouns. From the 16th century onwards it was not applied to the stems of inanimate nouns, and from the 18th century – to the stems of nouns referring to non-persons. Forms "Włoszy, mniszy" (Italians, monks) have been replaced by "Włosi, mnisi" with the phonetic softness introduced in the 17th century.
In the accusative -y was gradually replacing -i as the ending applied to the stems of masculine nouns. Since the 16th century it was applied even to the stems of nouns referring to persons. It was popular especially in the Enlightenment (syny, wnuki, greki) ("sons, grandsons, Greeks"). For feminine nouns it is still applied to the stems ending in -a- and also to some forms in the nominative singular ending in -0.
The ending -e, derived from the stems ending in -i- (gost-ьje, lud-ьje) ("guests, people"), -n- (dьn-e, kamen-e, mestjan-e) ("days, stones, townsmen") and forms such as przyjaciele, cesarze ("friends, caesars"), have dominated soft-stem masculine nouns. For feminine nouns it is still applied to the stems ending in -ja- and has spread onto some of the forms in the nominative singular ending in -0.
The ending -owie in the 14th - 15th century was applied to all stems of masculine nouns. Since the 16th century it has been gradually disappearing, especially from inanimate nouns and those referring to nonpersons, still Norwid (1821–1883) used obłokowie ("clouds") to make up a rhyme.
In the Old Polish, soft-stem nouns sometimes had the ending -ewie applied instead of -owie.
The ending -a is still applied to the stems of neuter nouns. Due to the influence of the Latin language, it has been applied since the 15th century to the stems of male nouns borrowed from Latin and German: akta, fundamenta, grunta, ("files, foundations, grounds") and temporarily (and incorrectly) also to originally Polish nouns: okręta, pociska ("ships, bullets"). Nowadays, the ending -a applied to the stems of masculine nouns is in general considered as incorrect, however: akta ("files")||akty ("acts").
The names of offices such as "podkomorzé" until the 15th century also had the ending -a applied in the plural. In the 16th century forms "chorążowie podczasze podchorąże ma pod sobą" were widely used; nowadays in the nominative it is "chorążowie" (warrant officers), in the dative "podchorążych" (of cup bearers).
The ending -´a (-´å) < -ьja today is used to construct forms such as brat – bracia ("brother - brothers"), ksiądz – księża ("priest - priests"). Initially, these forms were interpreted as collective nouns (bracia stała = braty stały) ("brothers stood"), księża poszła = księdzowie poszli ("priests went"), and were declined in the same way as female nouns (others of this type in the accusative had applied the ending -ą, in the genitive, dative and locative: -ej). In the writings of Skarga (1536–1612) they were declined in the same way as plural nouns (braciom, braćmi, braciach, księżom, księżmi, księżach) ("brothers, priests"). In dialect forms such as swaciå, muzykanciå, adwokaciå ("matchmakers, musicians, lawyers")can be found.
Genitive.
The ending -0 has started to be widely applied to neuter and feminine hard-stem nouns. For soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied is -y. Until 17th century, its traces were present in the old masculine stems ending in -o-, -jo-: genitive woz ("carriage"), god, tysiąc ("thousand"), dziej, włos ("hair"). Nowadays, it is present in forms such as przyjaciół ("friends"), dotychczas ("until now").
The ending -ów has become characteristic of the masculine hard-stem nouns, for soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied is -y. In Old Polish it had a slightly different pronunciation and was more widely applied: pisarzow ("of writers"), koniow ("of horses"), dniow ("of days"), miesiącow ("of months"), in dialects: krolew ("of kings"). 
For soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied instead of -ów/-0 is -y.
Dative.
In the past, the ending -om has been widely applied to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns. Since the Middle Polish period it has started to be applied to the stems of feminine nouns.
In Old Polish -am prevailed as the ending applied to the stems of feminine nouns. In the 15th - 17th century it was applied also to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns.
The ending -em until the 17th century was sometimes applied instead of -om to the stems of masculine nouns. There are no traces of this ending being applied to the stems of neuter nouns.
The endings -um, -óm in Old Polish were sometimes applied to the stems of neuter nouns instead of -om.
Accusative.
Initially, the endings -e/-y in the masculine accusative were distributed as endings applied to the stems of non-person nominative nouns. However, in the 17th century the accusative was made the same as the genitive. This change became common in the 17th century. Old accusative was and still is used for stylistic reasons: króle ("kings"), pany ("masters"), chłopy ("peasants").
The forms of feminine and neuter nouns in the plural accusative have remained the same as in the plural nominative.
Instrumental.
In the past, the ending -ami has been most widely applied to the stems of feminine nouns. Since the 15th century it came to be applied to the stems of neuter nouns and in the 16th - 17th century, despite the resistance of grammarians, to the stems of masculine nouns.
The ending -mi was applied in Old Polish to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns, especially to soft-stem ones, and also to the stems of some feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0. In principle, today it is only applied to the stems of masculine and feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0 and having a phonetically soft-stem.
The ending -y was applied in Old Polish to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns, especially to hard-stem ones. Until now it has survived in phrases such as "tymi czasy" (these days).
The ending -oma, derived from the dual number, was applied to the stems of masculine nouns in the 16th - 17th century.
Locative.
In the past, the ending -ach has been applied to feminine nouns. It could also be found in the masculine and neuter but came to be formally applied to nouns in these two genders in the 17th century.
The ending -'ech was applied in the Old Polish to masculine and neuter nouns, especially those with hard-stem: wilcech ("wolf"), syniech ("son"), skrzydlech ("wings"), leciech. The traces have remained in the names of countries: Na Węgrzech ("in Hungary").
The ending -och was applied to nouns of all genders in the 14th - 16th century, especially to soft-stem nouns and also to those ending with -k, -g, -ch, most probably because of the influence of the endings such as -owie, -ów, -om.
Vocative.
The plural vocative has remained the same as the nominative.
Mixed Declension.
The mixed declension is characteristic of forms such as poeta ("poet"), mężczyzna ("man"), Jagiełło, Fredro, sędzia ("judge").
In Old Polish forms such as starosta ("prefect"), poeta ("poet") were declined like feminine nouns. In the 16th century plural forms were changed due to their meaning (also plural dative such as "mężczyznam").
Until the 17th century, nouns such as Fredro in plural had forms "Fredra, Fredrowi, Fredrę" and so on.
In the 15th century nouns such as sędzia *ciech > tych jak ich (these as their)
Primarily, the singular feminine accusative ending was -ę. The form "ją" (her) was the only exception. Due to the influence of adjectives the use of the form -ą came to be more widely applied. Nowadays, the only existing form is "tę". (In 1996 the accusative form "tą" was accepted as correct in the spoken language.)
Pronouns without gender.
They have undergone just slight changes:
The old genitive čьso was transferred to the accusative and has spread to be applied to the nominative. The old accusative has preserved its prepositions: w niwecz < vъ nivъčь, przecz < prěčь, zacz < začь.
Numerals.
Ordinal, multiplicative and multiple numerals declined and still decline in the same way as adjectives so they will not be discussed here.
One.
Numeral "jedinъ" has preserved the mixed pronoun-adjectival declension.
One hundred.
For the declension of numerals a new and quite irregular pattern has been constructed, based on the dual number.
Twenty - ninety, two hundred - nine hundred.
Combinations of words have been turned into compounds.
Collective numerals.
The forms of collective numerals have been blended (portmanteau)
Dual number.
Dual number has disappeared, only some endings have been preserved: oczy (eyes), uszy (ears), rękoma or rękami (with hands, both correct), also in dialects and in proverbs: "mądrej głowie dość dwie słowie, lepszy wróbel w ręku niż gołąb na sęku". ("Two words are enough for a smart head, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush").
Conjugation.
The distinction between stems of the present tense verbs and stems of the past tense verbs has been preserved.
Infinitive.
The ending -i has disappeared (at first from endings *-cy < -ci):
Present tense.
It has undergone just slight changes:
Many verbs have changed their present tense forms:
Instead of -ętъ for athematic verbs or for verbs with stems ending in -i-, the form -jątъ is used:
Conjugation "-am,-asz".
Based on the conjugation of athematic verbs, the new conjugation -am, -asz has been introduced (very rarely -em, -esz):
By analogy to "dam" (I will give) - "dasz" ("you will give"):
in general (compare with dadzą) ("they will give"):
Past tenses.
Aorist - a past perfective tense, used to mark an action that happened only once and was fully accomplished in the past. Initially, it was used with both perfective and imperfective verbs. Out of the three types of aorist: asygmatic, sygmatic I and sygmatic II, only the sygmatic I was used in the Polish language. It was used with verbs which stems in the infinitive ended in a vowel.
Imperfect - was used to mark an action that took place or was repeated in the past. It was used with imperfective verbs.
Aorist and Imperfect merged and then disappeared. The ending characteristic of the aorist has remained present in some dialects: byłech, byłek (=byłem) ("I was")
The past imperfective tense has become a past simple tense bylъ jes-mь > byłem. ("I was")
The pluperfect is currently disappearing.
Future tense.
The present forms of perfective verbs have retained their future meaning.
The future tense of imperfective verbs is still constructed by combining a conjugated form of "będę" with an infinitive or a past participle: będę chwalić or będę chwalił. ("I will be praising").
Conditional.
The Protoslavic form of a conditional was replaced by the aorist (Old Polish "bych"), which then underwent some changes due to the influence of past tense endings.
Dual number.
Dual number survived until 14th - 15th century with some slight changes:
In the 16th century dual number disappeared from the literary language. It has been preserved in a number of dialects but the meaning of words in the dual number is equal to their blending in plural. The first person ending -ma is sometimes used as a result of merging -wa with -my.
chodźwa, chodźma (=chodźmy) ("/we/let's go").
Only in the region of Tarnobrzeg does the distinction still exist for niesiewa, nieśwa (dual number) and niesiemy, nieśmy (plural) ("we carry, let's carry").

Hans Lorbeer

Hans Lorbeer (August 15, 1901 - September 7, 1973) was a German politician and writer.
Life.
Hans Lorbeer was born as the illegitimate child of a worker girl in Lutherstadt Wittenberg in the Province of Saxony and grew up with foster parents in Kleinwittenberg and Piesteritz, both districts of Lutherstadt Wittenberg. After a non-self contained vocational training as a plumber, he was a laborer at different chemical laboratories in and around Wittenberg. He would become a member of the "Freien deutsche Jugend" (Free German Youth) in 1918, then the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1921 and then a co-founder of the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors in 1928. He wrote for the KPD newspaper "Klassenkampf" (Class Struggle) in Halle and "Die Rote Fahne" after 1927. He was sacked from the Nitrogen factory in Piesteritz for political agitation and remained jobless until 1933. His exclusion from the KPD in 1931 because of violation of party lines that would be annulled in 1945. In 1932 he joined the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition). Because of anti-fascist resistance and contacts to the group "Weise", he would be in a concentration camp in 1933 and 1934, then the "Zuchthaus" and "Emslandlager", after which he was a laborer under Gestapo supervision.
From May 8, 1945 until July 31, 1950, Lorbeer was mayor of Piesteritz and then a freelance writer until his death.
Hans Lorbeer was a member of the "Akademie der Künste". For his literary works, he was awarded the 1959 Heinrich Mann Prize, the 1961 National Prize of East Germany, the 1963 Mündel Prize of the Halle "Bezirk" and the 1971 Lion Feuchtwanger Prize, as well as the gold Patriotic Order of Merit and the Order of the Banner of Labor. On August 8, 1976, the city government of Lutherstadt Wittenberg agreed that Hans Lorbeer would be named an honorary citizen of the City. On the basis of the then legally valid position, he is viewed as the last Honorary Citizen of that city.
Works.
A representative selection of Lorbeer's poetic writings offered in the volume "Chronik in Versen". "Gedichte aus fünf Jahrzehnten" had appeared in the 1971 "Mitteldeutschen Verlag" as a piece of Lorbeer's "Gesammelten Werken in Einzelausgaben".

Sandwich Day

"Sandwich Day" is the fourteenth episode of the second season of "30 Rock" and the thirty-fifth episode overall. It was written by one of the season's executive producers, Robert Carlock, and one of the season's co-executive producers, Jack Burditt. The episode was directed by one of the season's producers, Don Scardino. The episode first aired on May 1, 2008 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode included Bill Cwikowski, Brian Dennehy, Marceline Hugot, Johnnie May, Jason Sudeikis, Miriam Tolan and Rip Torn. The episode earned Tina Fey the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.
Unusually this episode begins on the 30 Rock title sequence - there is no cold open as is normally the case.
This episode begins on the annual "TGS with Tracy Jordan" (a fictional sketch comedy series) Sandwich Day. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) receives a phone call from her ex-boyfriend, Floyd (Jason Sudeikis), asking for a place to stay; Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and the "TGS" writers try to get a new sandwich for Liz; Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) reconsiders his future at General Electric.
Plot.
It is the annual Sandwich Day for the crew of "TGS". The Teamsters, led by Mickey J. (Brian Dennehy), bring in "secret" sandwiches from an unknown Italian delicatessen in Brooklyn. When the writers eat Liz's sandwich, Liz threatens that she will "cut faces up so bad [... [they'll] all have chins." As a result, the writers and Tracy, aided by Jenna, enter a drinking contest against the Teamsters in an attempt to get Liz a new sandwich.
Floyd, who broke up with Liz in the episode "Hiatus", calls Liz to ask if he can have a place to stay, as he has come to visit New York on business. Liz tries to win Floyd back, only for him to lie to her about going home to Cleveland, Ohio. Floyd eventually travels home, and the pair agree to remain friends. 
Meanwhile, after being ousted from his office on the 52nd floor by Devon Banks (Will Arnett), Jack is not taking well to his new job on the 12th floor. He later decides to move to Washington, D.C., to be the new "Homeland Security Director for Crisis and Weather Management."
Production.
This episode was primarily filmed on April 1, 2008. This episode was the fourth episode written by Jack Burditt and the seventh written by Robert Carlock. The episode was the twelfth episode which was directed by Don Scardino.
Jason Sudeikis, who played Floyd in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of "Saturday Night Live", a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on "Saturday Night Live" from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of "Saturday Night Live" have appeared on "30 Rock", including Rachel Dratch, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Chris Parnell and Molly Shannon Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of "Saturday Night Live". Alec Baldwin has also hosted "Saturday Night Live" fourteen times, the second highest number of episodes of any host of the series. This was actress Johnnie May's second appearance in "30 Rock". She previously appeared in the episode "Tracy Does Conan" as a nurse who takes Liz's blood for donation. In this episode she plays a screener who would not allow Liz past airport security because she had her Sandwich Day sandwich with her, and its dipping sauce container held "more than 3 ounces."
Reception.
"Sandwich Day" brought in an average of 5.4 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 2.6/7 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.6 refers to 2.6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S., and the 7 refers to 7% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S.
Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode "turned out to be an absolute winner". He concluded that "with its more relatable storylines and moments like the eerie-voiced guy at the hospital, Liz tipping tables for her mac and cheese, and watching an entire sandwich be eaten in real time in the airport security line, 'Sandwich Day' was a definite highlight in the post-writers' strike season." Erin Fox of "TV Guide" said that "the minor story of the episode was probably the funniest". Jeff Labrecque of "Entertainment Weekly" thought that this episode "was nothing more than..."eh"". He called this episode a "weak link".

From 1961-1964, Manos lived in Greece, photographing the people and landscape. This work resulted in "A Greek Portfolio", published in 1972 and which won awards at Arles and the Leipzig book fair. In 1963, Manos joined Magnum Photos and became a full member in 1965.
After his time in Greece, Manos lived in Boston. In 1974, Manos was hired by the city to create the photographs for the "Where's Boston?" exhibition, a large production in honor of Boston's 200th anniversary. The photos from that exhibit were published in the book "Bostonians: Photographs from Where's Boston?" He also worked on projects for Time-Life Books.
In 1995, "American Color" was published, containing Manos' recent photographs of American people. "A Greek Portfolio" was reissued in 1999, followed by a major exhibition of his work at the Benaki Museum of Athens. In 2003, Manos was awarded the Leica Medal of Excellence for his "American Color" photographs.

Sonia McMahon

Sonia McMahon, known from 1977 as Lady McMahon (1 August 19322 April 2010), was the wife of Sir William McMahon, Prime Minister of Australia, and a philanthropist and Sydney socialite.
Early life and education.
Sonia Rachel Hopkins was born at 'Borambil', Redmyre Road, Strathfield. She was the daughter of W E and Lilla Hopkins and granddaughter of grazier William Matchett. Matchett was one of Australia's wealthiest men. His estate was valued at over £580,000 gross after his death in 1932, the year Sonia was born.
Career and marriage to William McMahon.
Sonia Hopkins worked as an occupational therapist until 1965 when she married William (better known as Billy) McMahon, an aspiring politician in Sir Robert Menzies' government. She was 32, he 57. It was the only marriage for both. He became Prime Minister in 1971.
Later that year, Sonia McMahon made world headlines after being photographed at the White House wearing a revealing dress in the company of her husband and United States president Richard Nixon. The white full-length dress featured see-through slits down both sides. The "Washington Post" described the dress as one of the most talked about items of clothing ever to be worn to the White House. In later years (then Lady McMahon) she spoke to her biographer, commenting that her husband chose the dress and that it had "certainly made an impact".
Their first two children (Melinda; and Julian, an actor) were born before he became prime minister. Their third child, Deborah, was born in 1971, during McMahon's term as prime minister.
As a prime ministerial spouse from March 1971 to December 1972, Sonia McMahon organised for a nanny to look after the children at the family home in the Sydney suburb of Bellevue Hill, while she lived with her husband at The Lodge in Canberra, attending official duties. In an interview with her biographer, Sonia McMahon said: "It was a hard decision. I loved being with Bill and I loved being a mum. But I knew I had to make a decision, and I chose to be with my husband."
William McMahon was knighted in 1977, and she became Lady McMahon, although often still referred to as simply Sonia McMahon. She became a widow in 1988, and in the ensuing years she continued her philanthropic activities. Lady McMahon became a board member and patron of many charities, including the National Brain Foundation, the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation, the Microsearch Foundation and Australia's Sudden Infant Death Syndrome association.
She had a very public falling out with her son Julian McMahon's then wife Dannii Minogue, calling her not worthy of being married into her family.
Death and legacy.
On 22 February 2009, Lady McMahon was seriously injured after slipping on the stairs of a luxury pleasure boat owned by her friend, Paul Ramsay. She was taken to St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney suffering broken ribs, punctured lung, and multiple other bone fractures. She was admitted to intensive care in March 2010 to undergo a procedure to clear her lungs of fluid. While in hospital, Lady McMahon had been preparing for an appearance at the Golden Slipper horse racing event at Rosehill Gardens Racecourse on 2 April.
Lady McMahon died aged 77 on 2 April 2010, in Sydney's St Vincent's Private Hospital after suffering from cancer; her three children were by her side. Tributes emerged from throughout the country from the Sydney social scene and from each side of the Australian political divide. Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott said, "She added grace and colour to our national life. We will all miss her. Our hearts go out to her family on this sad day". Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described Lady McMahon as a "distinguished representative of Australia ... this is a day of great sadness".
Media outlets noted her work in contributing to the community by attending fundraisers for charity and different organisations including being on the board of the Sydney Children's Hospital as well as for her complete loyalty to her husband. Lady McMahon's estate has been estimated to be worth $30 million in 2010, made up of real estate throughout New South Wales, which she inherited from her late husband .

Neptunia oleracea

Neptunia oleracea, commonly known in English as water mimosa or sensitive neptunia, is pantropical nitrogen-fixing perennial legume. Genus and common name come from Neptune, god of the sea, in reference to the aquatic habit of some species in the genus.
Description.
Aerenchyma (white spongy air-conducting tissue that gives stems buoyancy) forms on stems floating in water, but does not form on stems growing on land. Plants typically grow to as much as 6" tall, but stems will spread in the water to 3-5' long. Stems are clad with bi-pinnate, fine, mimosa-like sensitive leaves that close up when touched. Primary leaf segments have 8-40 small oblong leaflets arranged in opposite pairs. Tiny greenish-yellow flowers are densely crowded into feathery orbicular inflorescences that bloom in summer. Fruits are flat pods (to 1-2" long). Floating aquatic plant stems often form thick foliage mats and is considered to be an invasive aquatic weed in some tropical waters where large mats may form that choke waterways, resulting in restricted water flow, reduced water quality, reduced fish activity and loss of some underwater and native wetland plants.
Habitat.
Primarily found growing prostrate in wet soils near the water's edge or floating on the water in relatively still-water areas. The native habitat of "Neptunia oleracea" is unknown, but some experts believe it is in the area of Mexico to northern South America.
Uses.
Culinary.
This plant is cultivated as a vegetable in southeast Asia (leaves and shoots have cabbage-like flavor). Young ends of stems and pods are edible and usually eaten raw as a vegetable in Thailand and Cambodia and cultivated much like rice. The young leaves, shoot tips and young pods are usually eaten raw or in stir-fries and curries such as "kaeng som".
Medicinal.
Juice of the stem and roots are used for medicinal purposes.

Wildlife of Bangladesh

The wildlife of Bangladesh includes Bangladesh's flora and fauna.
Bangladesh is home to roughly 53 species of amphibian, 19 species of marine reptiles, 139 species of reptile, 380 species of birds, 116 species of mammals and 5 species of marine mammals. In addition to the large bird count, a further 310 species of migratory birds swell bird numbers each year. It has the Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, Hoolock gibbon, Asian black bear and other flagship species. The vast majority of these creatures currently dwell in an area of land that is some 150 000 sq kilometers in size! This is a remarkable achievement to say the least. However this does not mean all is well with the country’s natural heritage. So far a number of creatures have disappeared completely from the country and a further 201 species are threatened. The dhole, also called the Asiatic wild dog, is now endangered by habitat and prey-species loss and human persecution. Notable animal species that have disappeared from Bangladesh are the one-horned Rhinoceros, the two-horned Rhinoceros, the Gaur, the Banteng, Swamp deer, Nilgai, Indian Wolf, wild Water Buffalo, marsh crocodile and common Peafowl. 
The majority of the human population lives in or around large cities and this has helped to limit deforestation to some extent. However, the growth rate continues to increase and this has placed large demands on the environment and lead to subsequent clearing of numerous natural habitats. Though several areas are protected under law, a large portion of Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth.

The Men's skeet event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on August 15 and 16 at the Beijing Shooting Range Clay Target Field.
The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 5 sets of 25 shots in the set order of skeet shooting. 
The top 6 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired one additional round of 25. The total score from all 150 shots was used to determine the final ranking.
Vincent Hancock from the United States took a one-hit lead in the qualification round. In the final round, Norway's Tore Brovold, who already shared the world record with Hancock, eliminated this gap by means of a perfect 25, thus also sharing the Olympic final record of 145 hits with him. Hancock came back to win the shoot-off for the gold medal. One hit behind the duo, Anthony Terras of France won the bronze medal shoot-off against Antonis Nikolaidis, denying Cyprus its first-ever Olympic medal.

African Agricultural Union

The African Agricultural Union (, SAA) was the first quasi-political party in Côte d'Ivoire, led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny throughout its existence. It was established on 3 September 1944 by Houphouët-Boigny and the colonial administration.
History.
The SAA was established on 3 September 1944 by Houphouët-Boigny and the colonial administration at an inaugural meeting in Abidjan. Under his presidency, it brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their paychecks and worked to protect their interests against those of European settlers. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labour. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers. Its success irritated the colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët. However, the SAA increased his popularity as the voice of the Africans.
When elected to the "assemblée constituante" on 4 November 1945, Houphouët-Boigny worked to implement the wishes of the SAA. He proposed a bill to abolish forced labour, the single most unpopular feature of French rule, on 1 March 1946 which the Assembly adopted in 1947. On 9 April 1946, Houphouët-Boigny, with the help of the "Groupes d'études communistes d'Abidjan", recreated the SAA as the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI), the first effective party in Côte d'Ivoire and the Ivorian section of the African Democratic Rally.

Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos

Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos is a bull ring in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. It is currently a derelict building that is crumbling down. It is forbidden for safety reasons to access the bull ring.
When in operation it could host 10,000 spectators. It is designed in typically Moorish style.
It officially opened on January 9, 1910, featuring the most famous Bullfighters of the time, Ricardo Torres (aka Bombita Grande) and his brother Manuel (aka Bombita Chico) from Spain.
Although originally scheduled to open on January 8, the opening was postponed as the owners feared they did not have the necessary comforts and services required for the event. Due to public uproar, mainly from Buenos Aires, they yielded to public demand and opened the following day to no less than 7,000 spectators.
The arena hosted a total of eight fights before bull fighting was prohibited by the Uruguayan national government in 1912.
The bull ring was part of a tourist complex including a jai alai court, a hotel, and racecourse. Currently only the racecourse is still in operation.

<doc id="18652920" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18652920" title="Wholesale funding">
Wholesale funding

Wholesale funding is a method that banks use in addition to core demand deposits to finance operations and manage risk. Wholesale funding sources include, but are not limited to, Federal funds, public funds (such as state and local municipalities), U.S. Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the U.S. Federal Reserve's primary credit program, foreign deposits, brokered deposits, and deposits obtained through the Internet or CD listing services.
Rationale.
Although core deposits continue to be a key liability funding source, many insured depository institutions have experienced difficulty attracting core deposits and are increasingly looking to wholesale funding sources to satisfy funding and liability management needs.
Liquidity risk.
Wholesale funding providers are generally sensitive to changes in the credit risk profile of the institutions to which they provide these funds and to the interest rate environment. For instance, such providers closely track the institution's financial condition and may be likely to curtail such funding if other investment opportunities offer more attractive interest rates. As a result, an institution may experience liquidity problems due to lack of wholesale funding availability when needed. Academic research suggests that the use of wholesale funding was one of the major determinants of bank vulnerability during the 2007-2010 financial crisis.

Margit Carstensen

Margit Carstensen (born 29 February 1940) is a German theatre and film actress, best known outside Germany for roles in the works of film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
Theater career.
Margit Carstensen is the daughter of a physician, and was born and raised in the north-German city of Kiel. Upon graduation from the local "Gymnasium" (high school) in 1958, she studied acting at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. This education led to her first stage appearances in Kleve, Heilbronn, Münster and Braunschweig. In 1965 Margit Carstensen received a four-year engagement with the Deutsches Schauspielhaus (German Playhouse) in Hamburg. There she played leading roles in plays by, among others, John Osborne and the classical Spanish playwright Lope de Vega.
In 1969 she gained local fame in the Theater am Goetheplatz in Bremen, where she met director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. She then worked under his direction in a comedy by the eighteenth-century Venetian Carlo Goldoni "The Coffee Shop" (which was recorded for television in 1970), bringing her to national fame in West Germany. She subsequently played the role of serial murderess Geesche Gottfried in the premiere of Fassbinder’s own play "Bremen Freedom" (also televised, in 1972), and then in the title role of his Henrik Ibsen adaptation "Nora Helmer" (televised in 1974) derived from "A Doll's House".
From 1973-76 Carstensen held a steady acting engagement in Darmstadt, and from 1976-77 once again in Hamburg. In 1977 she moved to what was then West Berlin, where she performed on the highly regarded "Staatliche Schauspielbühnen". In 1982 she moved to Stuttgart in order to work with director Hansgünther Heyme, where she appeared in a series of plays directed by him. Over the years she also performed in many smaller roles on the most important of the German-language stages, for example making several appearances in the Munich Kammerspiele.
By the late 1980s she had developed ongoing working relationships with well-known German directors Werner Schroeter, Christoph Schlingensief and Leander Haußmann. For the season of 2003/04 Ms. Carstensen appeared in the Vienna Burgtheater, in the premiere of Elfriede Jelinek’s play “Bambiland,” under direction of Schlingensief.
In 2008 she appeared in the Schauspielhaus Bochum (Playhouse Bochum), in Shakespeare's "As You Like It".
Film and television.
Carstensen is best known outside Germany for the many film and television productions of Rainer Werner Fassbinder in which she participated. She played leading roles in the Fassbinder films "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant" (1972), her best-known role for Fassbinder; "Martha" (1974), with Karlheinz Böhm, analysing a traditional marriage in a contemporary setting; "Fear of Fear" (1975); "Mother Küsters' Trip to Heaven" (1975); "Satan's Brew" (1976); "Chinese Roulette" (1976) and "Women in New York" (1977). She also appeared in individual episodes of two Fassbinder television productions: "Eight Hours Are Not a Day" (1972), and "Berlin Alexanderplatz" (1980).
Carstensen also worked in international productions. In the third film made by Polish director Andrzej Żuławski, "Possession" (1981), a French-German coproduction, she performed together with Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill and Heinz Bennent. Four years later she worked with Polish-born director Agnieszka Holland on her film "Angry Harvest" (1985), together with Armin Mueller-Stahl. This film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
Her artistic collaboration with director Christoph Schlingensief began with two of his film projects. In his "Adolf Hitler - A Hundred Years: The Last Hours in the Führer’s Bunker" (1989), she played the part of Magda Goebbels. In his satirical political spoof "Terror 2000: Intensive Care Germany" (1992), she played the role of a Detective.
Carstensen has appeared in films by directors such as Leander Haußmann ("Sonnenallee", 1999); Romuald Karmakar ("Manila", 2000); Chris Kraus ("Scherbentanz", 2002, a role for which she won the Bavarian Film Award for Best Actress); Oskar Roehler ("Agnes and His Brothers", 2004) and Detlev Buck ("Hands off Mississippi", 2007).
Over the 2007/08 season Carstensen assisted with the Austrian-German TV documentary "Mr. Karl – A Person for People", directed by Kurt Mayer.

Tetris Party

The game was released in Japan on October 14, 2008, in North America on October 20, 2008, and in Europe and Australia on October 24, 2008.
A retail version called "Tetris Party Deluxe", which was announced by Tetris Online, Inc., Hudson Soft, Nintendo Australia and Majesco, was released in North America on June 1, 2010, in Europe on September 3, 2010 and in Australia on October 14, 2010 for the Wii and the Nintendo DS systems.
There used to be a version from the DSiWare called "Tetris Party Live", which was released in North America on November 22, 2010 and later in the PAL region on December 3, 2010. The game has now been delisted as of March 31, 2012.
Game modes.
"Tetris Party" introduces a number of new game modes. In addition to the 15-level traditional single player only marathon mode, the single and multiplayer versus modes, and Vs. Hot Lines and Team Battle modes returning from earlier games, as well as the return of Bombliss, these new modes include:
The multiplayer versus modes support up to four players offline and six players online through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, and feature new powerups that utilize the pointer and motion functions of the Wii Remote. The game also keeps skill charts and statistics, and features online leaderboards and more than 130 achievements for players to monitor their progress.
The game does not include any multiplayer marathon modes. Garbage is not optional in multiplayer mode as it was in "The New Tetris".
Tournament play.
Both Hudson and Tetris Online have organized tournaments for players of the game, with the first held in December 2008. Each tournament involves the different game modes in "Tetris Party", with the first and third tournaments featuring four rounds with four different game modes contested in each.
There was a total of four tournaments where the top 500 in the first and third tournaments and top 100 in the second and fourth tournaments would be credited with 1,200 Nintendo points to use for either the Wii Shop or DSiWare Shop.
Reception.
IGN scored the game a 9/10, calling it "the best console version "Tetris" we've seen in years" and a "must buy", though they were slightly disappointed in the somewhat limited online multiplayer. WiiWare World gave it 8/10, praising the online play in general and calling it "the most robust online "Tetris" experience money can buy" next to "Tetris DS", though they were also disappointed in the limited online play modes and felt the game is geared more towards local multiplayer than for solo players. The Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game 91%. They were very impressed by the "addictive online play" and commented on the "great variety of modes". They also loved the "classic Tetris gameplay" and thought it was "good value for your points." However they did mark it down as they thought the "Balance Board mode was a bit gimmicky." It was nominated for multiple Wii-specific awards by IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best WiiWare Game and Best Puzzle Game.

Princes Pier

Princes Pier is a 580 metre long historic pier on Port Phillip, in Port Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was known as the New Railway Pier until renamed Prince's Pier after the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) who visited Melbourne in May 1920.
History.
The pier was constructed between 1912 and 1915 by the Melbourne Harbour Trust to supplement the adjacent Station Pier (originally the 'Railway Pier'). From completion in 1915 until 1969 it was also a major arrival point for new migrants, particularly during the post-war period. In addition to a pier, there was a gatehouse and barriers, terminal building, amenities rooms, goods lockers, ablution blocks, railway sidings and passenger gangways. 
From opening the pier was linked by rail to the Port Melbourne railway line, via double lines branching from the Melbourne side of Graham station. Eight railway tracks ran onto the bridge, four along either face. A passenger rail service was provided to the pier from 30 May 1921 operated by suburban electric trains. Provided when ships were docked at the pier, it was usually operated by a single double ended 'swing door' motor car until ended in November 1930, as it was not financially rewarding to the Victorian Railways. The overhead wiring was removed on 17 August 1953 and the line singled and worked as a siding from 21 March 1961.
With the containerisation boom the pier became unused, being closed to public access in the early 1990s due to the poor timber condition, and squatters caused a fire in the late 1990s that destroyed the store structures. In the three years to 2004, 14 fires occurred. A refurbishment estimated to cost $14 million was announced by the State Government in April 2006, with the first 196 metres of the Pier fully restored, beyond that point the decking will be removed and the original pylons preserved. A full restoration was estimated at $60 million. A contract for the work was awarded in June 2007, and work began in October of the same year. The pier reopened to the public in December 2011.

He spent a total of 17 seasons at the club and retired at the end of the 1990/1991 season, after the match against Aswan in the Egypt Cup final, where they won 1-0.
Internationally, he made his first appearance as a team to Egypt in 1974 and spent 16 years. He won the African Nations Cup in 1986 and participated in the Olympic Games. He was a member of the Egypt squad which participated in the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy.
In 2004, he then became the technical director of El Ahly. He succeeded by his office in achieving many of the championships, 5 of them in successive league championships, the Egypt Cup once and twice the championship of the Arab Clubs Champions and Super Cup twice.
Thabet El-Batal died in February 2005, after a long battle with cancer.

Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 10 metre air pistol

The Women's 10 metre air pistol event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on August 10 at the Beijing Shooting Range Hall. Natalia Paderina of Russia set a new Olympic record in the qualification round with 391 points out of 400, but entering the final Guo Wenjun was only one point behind and through the last ten shots emerged as the winner. After the competition, Paderina (silver) and Georgian veteran Nino Salukvadze (bronze) posed together, showing the world that their friendship was unaffected by the newly broken-out war in South Ossetia, which only a day earlier had threatened Salukvadze's participation in the Olympics; Salukvadze took the opportunity to take a stand for a peaceful solution.
The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 40 shots with an air pistol at 10 metres distance. Scores for each shot were in increments of 1, with a maximum score of 10.
The top 8 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired an additional 10 shots. These shots scored in increments of .1, with a maximum score of 10.9. The total score from all 50 shots was used to determine final ranking.
Records.
Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.
Both Olympic records were broken during the competition: the qualification record was raised to 391 by Natalia Paderina and the final record to 492.3 (390+102.3) by Guo Wenjun.

The Women's 25 metre pistol event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on August 13 at the Beijing Shooting Range Hall. It was won by the reigning World champion, Chen Ying of the host nation, while Otryadyn Gündegmaa won Mongolia's second Olympic medal in shooting ahead of Munkhbayar Dorjsuren who won its first, 16 years earlier, but now competes for Germany.
The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 60 shots with a pistol at 25 metres distance. Scores for each shot were in increments of 1, with a maximum score of 10. The first 30 shots were in the precision stage, with series of 5 shots being shot within 5 minutes. The second set of 30 shots gave shooters 3 seconds to take each shot.
The top 8 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired an additional 20 shots. These shots scored in increments of .1, with a maximum score of 10.9. They were fired in four sets of 5 rapid fire shots. The total score from all 80 shots was used to determine final ranking.
Records.
Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.

The precision stage was fired at 09:00 China Standard Time (UTC+8), with all participants fitting into a single relay. In this stage, the time limit for each five-shot string is five minutes. Sonia Franquet of Spain took a two-point lead.
The rapid fire stage was fired at 12:00, with all participants fitting into a single relay. In this stage, the shooter must fire one shot each within three-second time frames, and the arm must be held at a 45 degree angle until the lights turn green, signalling the beginning of these time frames. To compensate for the shorter time, the score zones are larger than in the precision round. Mongolia's Otryadyn Gündegmaa shot 29 tens and only 1 nine, taking the overall lead and equalling the Olympic record for the qualification round that Tao Luna had set in Sydney (as opposed to Gündegmaa's 291+299, Tao had shot her record 299+291).

Prince Henry the Navigator (statue)

Prince Henry the Navigator is an historic statue located on a traffic median at the intersection of Eastern Avenue and Pleasant Street in the Flint Village section of Fall River, Massachusetts.
The statue by Aristide Berto Cianfarani was erected in 1940 by people from New England of Portuguese descent to mark the 800 year anniversary of the Portuguese National Organization in 1140, and as a tribute to Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460), whose explorations and scientific accomplishments beaconed the ocean route to India and opened the gateway of the Atlantic Ocean for the eventual exploration of the American continents.
The base of the statue was constructed from remains of the former Fall River Customhouse and United States Post Office which were demolished in the early 1930s.
The statue was nominated by local and state historical commissions but denied placement on the National Register of Historic Places by the Department of the Interior in 1983.
In the 1980s the traffic island surrounding the base of the statue was redecorated with a stone mosaic pattern with waves and other nautical themed-items.

Drive on Munda Point

The Drive on Munda Point was an offensive by mainly United States Army forces against Imperial Japanese forces on New Georgia in the Solomon Islands from 2-17 July 1943. The Japanese forces, mainly from the Imperial Japanese Army, were guarding an airfield at Munda Point on New Georgia that the U.S. wished to capture.
The U.S. offensive made small gains because of limited combat experience by its soldiers, poor leadership by inexperienced US Army officers, harsh terrain and conditions on New Georgia, and effective defensive measures by the Japanese. The U.S. soldiers experienced an unusually high number of severe cases of combat stress reaction. The drive on Munda was halted on 17 July when the Japanese launched a large, ultimately unsuccessful, counterattack on the American forces. The Americans eventually secured the airfield in the Battle of Munda Point.

The Action of 16 March 1917 was a naval battle in which the German auxiliary cruiser "Leopard" was engaged and sunk by the British Armed boarding steamer HMS "Dundee" and the cruiser HMS "Achilles".
Action.
After leaving port in March disguised as the Norwegian freighter "Rena Norge", the "Leopard" set sail on its mission to disrupt Allied commerce. On the 17 March it was stopped in the North Sea by the cruiser HMS "Achilles" and ordered to proceed to the boarding vessel HMS "Dundee" for inspection. Heavily outgunned Captain Hans von Laffert, the raider's commander, had no option other to proceed to meet the boarding vessel.
Captain Selwyn Day of the "Dundee" dispatched a launch containing a boarding party with an officer and five men to investigate the mysterious ship. Hans von Laffert realizing he was about to be discovered detained the party and after about an hour opened fire on the "Dundee" with a salvo of two torpedoes. The steamer manoeuvred out of the way barely in time and the torpedoes missed Captain Day's ship by twenty feet. Day ordered his guncrews to open fire and a hail of shells struck the "Leopard" damaging a gun and setting fires. The "Achilles" hearing the sound of gunfire returned to the scene and opened fire on the raider as the "Dundee" withdrew. Shortly after the "Achilles's" arrival the "Leopard" sank with all 319 hands going down with the ship. Damage to the British vessels was light and the only casualties consisted of the six boarding party members who were trapped in the "Leopard" when it sank.

Auburn was an unincorporated community in rural Baker County, Oregon, United States, now considered a ghost town. Auburn lies off Oregon Route 7 southwest of Baker City and east of McEwen on the edge of the Blue Mountains.
Auburn is deserted today, but the former gold mining boomtown was once the largest community in Eastern Oregon. Auburn only had one or two buildings until 1861, when gold was discovered in the area. By September 1862, Auburn had grown into a full-fledged town with over 20 stores and 1000 homes to serve the mining industry. In that month the Oregon Legislative Assembly made Auburn the first county seat of Baker County, but by the 1870s Auburn was largely deserted, with a population of 200 people in 1873. The post office, the first in northeast Oregon, closed in 1903.

Beaker Street

Beaker Street with Clyde Clifford was the first underground music program broadcast regularly on a commercial AM radio station in the central US. "Beaker Street" began on Little Rock, Arkansas 50,000 watt AM radio station KAAY late in 1966 and ran through 1972. The show's original announcer, Clyde Clifford, moved to FM in 1974 as the rise in popularity of FM radio began to impact the operations of many AM stations. "Beaker Street" pre-dated the FM radio boom of the mid-1970s and foretold the rise of Album Oriented Rock and Classic rock formats.
History.
Dale Seidenschwarz, aka Clyde Clifford, was the prototype of the laid-back late-night radio DJ, known for the very long pauses in his speech. The stage name of Clyde Clifford continued a tradition at KAAY whereby the on-air personalities often fashioned a stage name from the names of the board of directors of LIN Broadcasting, the owners of KAAY. Clyde W. Clifford was the comptroller general of LIN Broadcasting.
Among the more memorable details of this radio program were the interludes of eerie sound effects and a background of space music between songs. These background sounds were necessary to mask the noise of the transmitter since the program originated at KAAY's transmitter location in Wrightsville, AR rather than in the station's broadcast studios in downtown Little Rock. Broadcasting from the transmitter site allowed a single employee, Clifford, to serve in the dual capacity of overnight broadcast engineer and as announcer. The original background music, composed by Henry Mancini, came from the dream sequence in the movie "Charade". In the early 1970s, the background music was changed to sounds from "Cannabis Sativa" by a band called Head. This background is still in use today as a trademark of "Beaker Street", although the need to mask transmitter sounds ended when the show left KAAY. The name of the show reflected the era in which it was created. "Beaker Street" was an oblique reference to LSD. The program featured Acid rock and its name alluded to the fact that "Acid" ( i.e., LSD ) was created in a laboratory beaker. The station tried to be as mysterious as possible, at one time even running a contest for listeners to try to guess how to spell Beaker, suggesting that it was spelled in some unconventional fashion.[http://www.beakerstreet.com/faq.htm]
Although Clyde Clifford (Dale Seidenschwarz) originated the concept of "Beaker Street", the show continued for some years after Clifford left KAAY in 1974. Several "Beaker Street" hosts used the screen name of Ken Knight, followed by Stuart McRae in the mid-1970s. Stuart McRae expanded the show from the original three hours to a full five and a half hours (11:00 PM to 4:30 AM). In early 1977, a new program director at KAAY decided to end "Beaker Street", viewing it as inconsistent with other programming. McRae resigned over this decision, and the last regular "Beaker Street" shows were handled by Don Payne.
Despite the show's demise on KAAY, "Beaker Street" remained a fond memory for many fans. When KAAY was sold and converted from a rock music to a religious format in 1985, Clyde Clifford was invited back to handle the final hours of rock music programming on March 3, 1985. At the conclusion of this melancholy and somewhat emotional program, believed by many listeners to be the last "Beaker Street", the final song played by Clifford was 'The Circle Game' by Joni Mitchell. 
Years later, Clyde Clifford and "Beaker Street" returned to the airwaves every Sunday night from 7 p.m. until midnight Central Time, first on KZLR (KZ-95) and later on Magic 105.1 FM KMJX. During that time the show was also streamed live via the internet, from the Beaker street homepage. As a result of a change in station programming format, the final "Beaker Street" on Magic 105 was broadcast February 17, 2008. "Beaker Street" begin broadcasting from its new home at The Point 94.1 FM on Sunday March 9, 2008, continuing to occupy the 7:00pm-midnight time slot on Sunday evenings. Ironically, the studio of The Point 94.1 FM is located in the same building (2400 Cottondale Lane in Little Rock, Arkansas) where Clyde Clifford broadcast the last hours of rock music programming on KAAY twenty-three years earlier. The last song of the new "Beaker Street" was, appropriately, the last song from KAAY, "The Circle Game" by Joni Mitchell. Jaime Brockett's "The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic" was also played in the third hour of the final show on the Point on February 6, 2011. Clyde Clifford was still searching for Beaker Street's next on-air home.
Significance of Beaker Street.
The strong nighttime signal of 50,000 watt, clear channel KAAY meant that it was possible to regularly listen to the station's nighttime programming in a wide area of the midwest and south. KAAY's late-night "footprint" gained fans as far west as Wyoming and Montana, north to the Dakotas and Manitoba and south as far as New Orleans and into Florida. This strong broadcast signal enabled "Beaker Street" to deliver the music of the late 1960s counterculture to many smaller towns in America, where such music could not otherwise be heard over the air waves. "Beaker Street" attracted a legion of fans across the Midwest with its pioneering format which featured long album cuts from rock artists who otherwise would not get commercial radio airplay.
One example of the impact of "Beaker Street" can be seen in the evolution and success of the band "Headstone", formed in 1969 by five students at the University of Northern Iowa. The band released a 45 record "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" which attracted the attention of Clyde Clifford and was placed in regular rotation on "Beaker Street". "Headstone" co-founder Tom Tatman characterized "Beaker Street" as "the ultimate Midwestern underground radio program of the day." The popularity generated by the "Beaker Street" exposure allowed the band to move to bigger and better performances, and in August 2006, the band was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
For fans of "Beaker Street", many album cuts became favorites over the years, including songs which were generally not available on either 45 records or LP albums. One such performance was a melancholy rendition of a Tom Paxton song, "Cindy's Cryin", performed by the Little Rock band "Deepwater Reunion" with vocalist Barbara Raney. Original records or tapes of this performance are rare, but a similar version of "Cindy's Cryin" has been performed by talented fans of the music, fans who first heard the song on "Beaker Street". Another rarely heard recording played on "Beaker Street" was the Jamie Brockett cover of an old Leadbelly song, which he called "The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic"; a rambling 13-minute Titanic opus, recorded in 1969, which has the ship's captain smoking a hemp cigarette with the first mate minutes before the ship hits the iceberg. 
Radio theater also made a comeback on "Beaker Street", in half-hour or hour-long segments called "Beaker Theatre"; sometimes utilizing serious (and occasionally not-so serious) re-workings of old radio serial scripts, voiced by the "Beaker Players"; sometime playing the recordings of the comedy group Firesign Theatre, especially the "Nick Danger - Third Eye" series of skits. During the run of "Beaker Street", the Firesign Theatre actually made several live appearances on the show.
Beaker Street in Cuba.
The KAAY nighttime signal was so strong that young people in Havana City and in other places in Cuba were able to receive it clearly. In the late 1970s, music sung in English was practically banned by the Communist Government. Cuban radio stations were allowed to devote only about 20% of their time broadcasting music sung in English, so many young people used to listen American radio stations as a response to that limitation, and the KAAY was one of the most popular of them. Today young people from those years still remember the DJ announcing "Beaker Street... an underground music service from KAAY, Little Rock, Arkansas..."

This TV

This TV (also known as "This TV Network" or "this") is an American television network that is operated as a joint venture between the Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary of the Tribune Company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. This TV features a general entertainment programming format with a large emphasis on movies, along with some limited classic television series and children's programming.
The network is available in many media markets via broadcast television stations (primarily on their digital subchannels), on select cable providers, and on free-to-air C-band satellite via SES-1 at 101 W in DVB-S format. This TV broadcasts 24 hours a day in the 480i standard definition broadcast format.
History.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Chicago-based television station owner Weigel Broadcasting announced the formation of This TV on July 28, 2008, with a planned launch that autumn. The network formally launched on November 1, 2008, though some stations may have "soft launched" the network one day earlier – on October 31, 2008 – to carry some Halloween-themed programming that was provided by the network.
The "This TV" name was chosen as a branding and marketing avenue for the network and its stations, with proposed slogans such as ""THIS" is the place for movies", ""THIS" is what you’re watching" and "It doesn't get any better than "THIS!"". This TV officially launched on November 1, 2008 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time with the 1986 Spike Lee film "She's Gotta Have It" as the network’s first program.
This TV’s operations were overseen under Weigel part-ownership by Neal Sabin, who in his role as Weigel Broadcasting’s executive vice president launched Me-TV, a classic television network similar to This TV. Jim Marketti, president/CEO of Marketti Creative Group was hired in August 2008 as This TV’s creative director, focusing on the network's marketing and promotion. MGM handles sales for the network through its offices in New York City.
On May 13, 2013, Weigel Broadcasting announced that it would be leaving the This TV partnership in order to focus on its new network, Movies!. Tribune Broadcasting, owners of the classic television multicast network Antenna TV, took over daily operations of the network on November 1, 2013; concurrently, the network moved its affiliation in Chicago from the fifth digital subchannel of Weigel flagship station WCIU-TV (channel 26) to a newly created third subchannel of Tribune flagship station WGN-TV (channel 9). Sean Compton, president of programming for Tribune Broadcasting, now oversees operations for the network.
Programming.
This TV's program schedule relies on the extensive library of films and television programming currently owned by MGM and subsidiary United Artists (notably excluding the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library, the a.a.p. library, "Gilligan's Island" and its animated spin-offs, and the U.S. rights to the RKO Pictures library, whose rights are currently held by Time Warner through its Turner Entertainment subsidiary). No originally produced programming appears on the network, although the use of on-air presenters had once been considered for This TV's movie broadcasts; the network is also devoid of informercial programming. However, the network does display an on-screen logo bug during its programs, and affiliates are inclined to include regional descriptors reflecting the station's primary broadcast area underneath the logo.
The network did not utilize a split-screen credit sequence to promote upcoming programs during the closing credits until Tribune took over operations (these appear in the formats used by Tribune's television stations and co-owned WGN America, with one or two network promos appearing on the top left of the screen on films that feature the original credits at normal speed and a text/background only graphic referencing the next program for series). Films broadcast on the network do feature commercial interruption, and breaks during programming primarily consist of direct response advertisements for products featured in informercials and particularly during This TV's children's programming, public service announcements. The network's first announcer was Milwaukee radio personality and Miller Park PA system announcer Robb Edwards. Later in the Weigel era, Jim Cummings voiced the network's continuity; Andy Geller, more known as the current voice of ABC, took over when Tribune assumed partial ownership of This TV.
Movies.
This TV's daily schedule consists largely of feature films, which air on Monday through Saturdays from 6 a.m.–4 a.m. and Sundays from 6–9 a.m., 2–6 p.m. and 2–4 a.m. ET (sometimes starting earlier or ending later depending on the length of the films). The film roster does not concentrate on films from any specific era, meaning any film from the Depression era to contemporary times and films made for either television, home video/DVD or theatrical release can be featured.
This TV also commonly features themed movie presentations, with the entire day's schedule consisting of films from a particular genre once a week throughout the month, such as Wednesdays – which feature action and western films under the theme "Wednesdays Are Wild". The network also broadcasts a featured movie in primetime at 8 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday nights. Until October 31, 2013, the weeknight prime movie presentations were typically replayed later in the evening (usually at 12 a.m. ET, depending on the length of the film that precedes it). From the network's launch until October 26, 2013, This TV ran a family film block preceding the network's Saturday morning "Cookie Jar Toons" block called "This Family Friendly"; under Tribune part-ownership, this block was discontinued in favor of airing a wider variety of films (mostly targeted at an adult audience) on Saturday mornings; however, family-oriented films remain part of the network's schedule, only airing on certain days in random timeslots.
The network's films usually, by far, air using the "television" cut meant for broadcast syndication which features content edits, dubbing or blanking of profanities (including some that may otherwise be permissible on broadcast television) and some time edits by removing superfluous plotting or adult scenes toned down to fit within a two-hour timeslot with commercials. The use of the "television" cut means that most of the network's films are also presented in a pan and scan format and not shown with letterboxing. Films which run under the allotted timeslot have "Pink Panther" cartoon shorts filling the remainder of the timeslot.
Films featured on This TV consist of releases from network co-parent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and its subsidiaries United Artists (post-1952 films) and The Samuel Goldwyn Company (pre-1997 films), as well as films produced by now-defunct film studios Orion Pictures (post-1981 films and its Orion Classics division), Cannon Group (except for those co-produced with Warner Bros.), American International Pictures, and the Mirisch Company (all of which were acquired by MGM); in addition, films produced by Polygram Filmed Entertainment (which was not acquired by MGM at the time Polygram folded in 1999, although MGM holds distribution rights to its pre-1996 films) are also featured on the network.
"All About Eve", which was released by 20th Century Fox, became the first non-MGM film to be aired on the network on February 6, 2011. In addition to 20th Century Fox, the network has acquired broadcast rights to classic movies from Paramount Pictures (through Trifecta Entertainment & Media), Universal Pictures (including among them Abbott and Costello movies), Miramax Films, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Anchor Bay Entertainment. Since January 2014, the network has begun to share film content with sister network Antenna TV (which runs its own movie block that currently airs on weekday mornings, and Friday and Saturday evenings); at times, This TV will air a film on the same day or week as its telecast on Antenna TV.
Classic television series.
The network's daily early morning and Sunday afternoon lineups feature vintage series – a mix of comedies and drama series from the 1960s to the early 2000s; weekdays feature shows such as "Highway Patrol" and "Sea Hunt", and weekends feature blocks of episodes of classic series such as "The Addams Family", "In the Heat of the Night", "Stargate SG-1", and "The Outer Limits". After Tribune Broadcasting assumed operations of the network, three series formerly seen on the network – "The Patty Duke Show", "Mister Ed" and "Green Acres" – were moved from This TV to new sister network Antenna TV.
Children's programming.
Under Weigel's co-ownership, This TV featured a daily block of children's programming each morning (including shows that meet the FCC's E/I content requirements) that was handled by Toronto-based Cookie Jar Entertainment, then by DHX Media when it purchased Cookie Jar in 2012. It also featured Weigel's Chicago-based program originally meant for local viewing, "Green Screen Adventures" (now seen only on Me-TV). The block's non-E/I programming was branded under the banner name "This is for Kids", while the E/I programming was branded under the name "Cookie Jar Toons". Children's programs featured in the blocks included library content from CJE entities DiC Entertainment and Cinar Films, as well as recent originally produced content by Cookie Jar. 
This differs from two other children's program blocks from Cookie Jar Entertainment that feature E/I-compliant children's programming: Cookie Jar Kids Network, a block that was discontinued in 2012 that featured mostly Cinar-produced programming from the 1990s, formerly known as the "DiC Kids Network" until a September 2009 rebranding; and the CJE-run Cookie Jar TV Saturday morning block for CBS which aired until September 2013.
With the switch to Tribune part-ownership, children's programs were removed from the network's weekday and Saturday morning schedules, coinciding with discontinuance of the network's agreement with Cookie Jar/DHX (effectively ending This's status as the only digital multicast network and one of only two broadcast networks, alongside The CW, to carry a traditional entertainment-based children's block rather than a strictly educational-based lineup); the former Cookie Jar Toons/This is for Kids block was replaced with a single three-hour unbranded Sunday block of E/I programming originally distributed for syndication from Bellum Entertainment, presently made up of "Animal Atlas", "Zoo Clues" and "On the Spot", all of which air two half-hour episodes each week.
Affiliates.
In addition to Weigel-owned stations in Chicago (WCIU), Milwaukee (WDJT-TV), and South Bend, Indiana (WCWW-LD), This TV reached agreements with several ownership groups to add the network to some of its stations in 2009. The group list included stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting, Hearst-Argyle Television, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Post-Newsweek Stations, Fisher Communications, Raycom Media and Belo. This TV's affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting was renewed in May 2010, a move that brought the network to additional Tribune-owned stations in markets such as Los Angeles, New York City, Miami and San Diego and helped This TV's coverage reach 85% of the U.S., making This TV the largest subchannel network by percentage of the population reached (a status that has since been surpassed by former sister network Me-TV). A number of NBC affiliates added This TV as a replacement for the now defunct NBC Weather Plus service, which shut down at the end of 2008. Additionally, Equity Media Holdings selected This TV as a replacement for the Retro Television Network on some of its stations after Equity dropped its relationship with RTN in January 2009 due to payment disputes; the Equity-owned stations have since been sold, with several disaffiliating with This TV or going off the air completely.
Stations that carry This TV have the option to air select programming from the network on their main channels; they also have the option to preempt This TV programs, running alternate programming in place of certain shows from the network's national schedule (some stations may even switch to scheduled alternate programming while a film is in progress), either via a secondary affiliation deal with another network such as The CW or MyNetworkTV (this is particularly common with This TV affiliates in smaller markets), substitutions by locally produced programming, or in the most common case, moving network programming to the This subchannel to accommodate local sports or breaking news coverage on the main channel.
With Tribune Broadcasting taking over operational responsibilities for the network, This TV became one of the few television networks to move its flagship station from one station to another; the network moved from WCIU to a digital subchannel of Tribune's Chicago flagship WGN-TV (which until November 1, 2013 was the largest Tribune-owned station by market size not to carry This TV). WDJT-DT3 will remain with the network for the time being, though Tribune is currently in the process of acquiring Milwaukee's Fox affiliate, WITI, which also carries sister network Antenna TV, while its status on WCWW will likewise not change immediately (partly due to the fact that Tribune does not own a station nor is purchasing one in that market). WITI and the other stations owned by Local TV – which Tribune bought in July 2013 – will likely affiliate with the network at some point after the purchase is finalized (for non-duopoly stations, This TV may be carried on a tertiary subchannel; for duopoly stations, This may be carried on a station that does not have any existing secondary subchannels, requiring one to be created to serve as the affiliate); in most markets where Local TV owns a station, and the existing Tribune stations in four markets where the network is not carried (KIAH/Houston, KCPQ-KZJO/Seattle, KTXL/Sacramento and WPMT/Harrisburg), however, This TV has existing affiliation deals with stations owned by another station group via national carriage deals; it is possible that Tribune will wait until these affiliation contracts lapse before moving the network to those affected stations.

Ralphs Grocery Store (Los Angeles, California)

Ralphs Grocery Store is a historic building in the Westwood Village section of Westwood, Los Angeles, California. Built in 1929 as a Ralphs Grocery Store, it was one of the original six buildings in the Westwood Village development. The building was noted for its cylindrical rotunda capped by a low saucer dome, with a pediment over the entrance and arcaded wings extending north and east. It was photographed by Ansel Adams in 1940, declared a Historic-Cultural Monument in 1988, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
Origins of Westwood Village.
The history of Westwood Village began in 1925, when the Regents of the University of California purchased a large block of land from the Janss Investment Company for the construction of the new UCLA campus. The Janss family retained ownership of the land south of the campus and there developed Westwood Village — a carefully planned commercial center that was to be "a model college town." The university and the Janss family agreed to harmonize the architecture of the campus and the village in a "Mediterranean style."
Architecture and opening of Ralphs Grocery Store.
The new Westwood Village began to open in 1929, and one of its original buildings was the Ralphs Grocery Store located on Westwood Boulevard, one block north of Wilshire Boulevard. The store's most prominent feature was its low rotunda, at the corner of Westwood Boulevard and Lindbrook Drive. The building's exterior walls were built with imitation stone, but were later covered with stucco. The building's style has been described as having Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Romanesque Revival and Renaissance Revival elements, and is said to have served as a model for other low-rise commercial structures in the village. Early advertising materials for the Westwood Village development featured images of the Ralphs tower and the Janss dome, which became area landmarks. The opening of the store in the fall of 1929 was timed to coincide with the opening of the UCLA campus, and the "Los Angeles Times" proclaimed the store "one of the most beautiful exclusive grocery marts in the West." The opening was celebrated with a free food show, as Ralphs boasted a new feature at their Westwood store — "the employment of uniformed boys to wrap each purchase of merchandise while it is being paid for at the cashier's stand, and then carry it to the customer's car."
In 1940, Ansel Adams took a series of photographs of Westwood Village, some featuring the Ralphs building. The photographs are part of the collections of the Los Angeles Public Library and can be viewed here, here and here.
Businesses operating in the building.
Ralphs operated a grocery store on the site until the mid-1960s, when it left Westwood Village. Ralphs returned to Westwood Village nearly 40 years later, converting the old Bullock's department store into a grocery store (formerly sharing the space with a Best Buy and an Expo Home Design Center). Since Ralphs vacated the building in the mid-1960s, it has housed a number of different businesses. In 1970 a large portion of the space facing Lindbrook Drive was converted into a movie theater, which was known over the years as the United Artists Theater, the UA Egyptian, the Odeon Cinema. and finally as the Mann Festival which closed on July 30, 2009. The Bratskeller restaurant, popular with UCLA students, also operated at the building from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. In the late 1990's and early 2000's the prime corner space at the base of the tower was split between Daphne's Greek Cafe and Togo's Sandwich Restaurant. In late 2008, they were replaced with a Peet's Coffee & Tea, which remains currently. In early 2012, part of shuttered movie theater was converted to 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria.
Historic preservation and designation.
Since the 1970s, the demand for office and residential space around the UCLA campus has resulted in much of the original Mediterranean architecture giving way to large modern high rises, as depicted in the photograph to the right. Preservationists sought to preserve what could be saved of the original Westwood architecture, and in 1988 the Ralphs-Bratskeller-Egyptian Theater building was designated as a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #360) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. Eight other historic buildings in Westwood Village (including the Fox Bruin Theater, the Fox Village Theater and the Janss Investment Company Building) were given monument status at the same time. In 1992, the Ralphs building was also added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Homestead is an unincorporated community in Baker County, Oregon, United States. Homestead lies on the Snake River south of Hells Canyon National Recreation Area and four miles north of Oxbow. Its ZIP code is 97840, and its area codes are 458 and 541.
Homestead was platted around 1898, along a Northwest Railway Company line that never developed. It thrived because of the patronage of the miners from the nearby Iron Dyke Mine and because it was railhead for the many local orchards.
From 1953 to 1960, Homestead was the starting point for passenger boat trips down the Snake River to Lewiston, Idaho operated by Blaine Stubblefield.
Hells Canyon Dam was completed in 1967, and the resulting Hells Canyon Reservoir may have inundated part of Homestead. Homestead today is a ghost town on the Oregon side of the reservoir.

Howard Brinton

Howard Haines Brinton (1884–1973) was an author, professor and director whose work influenced the Religious Society of Friends movement for much of the 20th century. His books ranged from Quaker journal anthologies to philosophical and historical dissertations on the faith, establishing him as a prominent commentator on the Society of Friends.
Early life.
Howard Brinton was born on 24 July 1884, in West Chester, Pennsylvania to a Quaker couple, who were from different strands of the Quaker faith: his father Orthodox and his mother Hicksite.
Academic career.
He studied at Haverford College with Rufus Jones and graduated in 1905, obtaining a Masters degree in 1906. He taught at Olney Friends School in Barnesville, Ohio, and at Pickering College in New Market, Ontario. In 1909, he obtained a doctorate in Physics from Harvard. 
In 1916, Howard Brinton was appointed acting President of Guilford College, North Carolina, at a troubled time for the college. He visited conscientious objectors imprisoned at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, who were not permitted to communicate with outside and whose location was not known to their relatives and friends.
AFSC.
This visit inspired him to join, in 1919, the American Friends Service Committee soon after, which allowed Quakers and other pacifists to serve during wartime in nonviolent means. It also co-ordinated relief to the victims of war.
The chaotic consequences of war, that he witnessed in Upper Silesia influenced his work as a pacifist speaker and writer in the 1920s and 1930s. It was during this period that he met Anna Shipley Cox (19 October 1887 - 28 October 1969), who also worked in Europe for AFSC. They married when he returned to the United States on 25 July 1921.
Academic career (continued).
In 1925, he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy from the University of California, while Anna taught at Mills College. Then they moved to Earlham College, Indiana, where both taught and their first three children were born. In 1929, they returned to California, where their fourth child was born and both taught at Mills. During this period he became involved in the case of Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings.
In 1931, they spent a year in England at Woodbrooke Quaker College in Birmingham. In that year, Howard gave the Swarthmore Lecture at London Yearly Meeting, with the title "Creative Worship".
Pendle Hill.
In 1936, Howard and Anna Brinton, became co-directors at the Pendle Hill religious center in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. 
A pen portrait of Pendle Hill in the Brinton period appeared in "Time" Magazine 21 June 1948. The article indicates the diversity of the students and the variety of their studies. 
Brinton used this opportunity to produce over a dozen books and pamphlets dealing with Quakerism. Ironically, one of his most productive writing periods came during World War II, during which he published the widely used "A Guide to Quaker Practice.". One of his later works, "Friends for 300 Years," was cited by Elizabeth Vining as "one of the great Quaker books of all time."
Japan and later years.
In 1949, Anna Brinton left Pendle Hill to work with AFSC. Howard continued until 1952, when he retired and the couple moved to Japan, in AFSC service. They returned to Pendle Hill in 1954. Howard's Japanese secretary, Yuki Takahashi, a widow, returned with them to help her employer write his memoirs, which have never been published. In May 1972, the nearly blind and aged Brinton, having obtained consent from his adult children, surprised everyone by marrying Takahashi.
Howard Brinton died on 9 April 1973. He is buried with his wife at the Oakland Friends Cemetery, West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania.

Mollaret's meningitis

Mollaret's meningitis is a recurrent inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. Since Mollaret meningitis is a recurrent, benign, aseptic meningitis, it is now referred to as "Benign Recurrent Lymphocytic Meningitis". 
Originally named for Pierre Mollaret a French neurologist who was first to describe it in 1944.
Signs and symptoms.
Mollaret's meningitis is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headache, meningismus, and fever; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with large "endothelial" cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and attacks separated by symptom-free periods of weeks to months; and spontaneous remission of symptoms and signs. Many people have side effects between bouts that vary from chronic daily headaches to after-effects from meningitis such as hearing loss. Some patients report short bouts of 3–7 days of being sick while others have cases that can last for weeks or months. Many references talk about brief acute cases but support groups of people with Mollaret's show a wide variety of lengths of each bout. Although historically Mollaret's meningitis did not have a causative agent, it is now believed to be mostly from herpetic infection. Some patients also report frequent shingles outbreaks. The chickenpox virus is part of the herpes family. CNS epidermoid cysts can give rise to Mollaret's meningitis especially with surgical manipulation of cyst contents.
Diagnosis.
Investigations include blood tests (electrolytes, liver and kidney function, inflammatory markers and a complete blood count) and usually X-ray examination of the chest. The most important test in identifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord) through lumbar puncture (LP). However, if the patient is at risk for a cerebral mass lesion or elevated intracranial pressure (recent head injury, a known immune system problem, localizing neurological signs, or evidence on examination of a raised ICP), a lumbar puncture may be contraindicated because of the possibility of fatal brain herniation. In such cases, a CT or MRI scan is generally performed prior to the lumbar puncture to exclude this possibility. Otherwise, the CT or MRI should be performed after the LP, with MRI preferred over CT due to its superiority in demonstrating areas of cerebral edema, ischemia, and meningeal inflammation.
During the lumbar puncture procedure, the opening pressure is measured. A pressure of over 180 mm H2O is suggestive of bacterial meningitis.
Mollaret's meningitis is suspected based on clinical criteria and confirmed by HSV 1 or HSV 2 on PCR of CSF, although not all cases test positive.
Treatment.
Initial treatment.
Acyclovir is the treatment of choice for Mollaret's meningitis. Some patients see a drastic difference in how often they get sick and others don't. Often treatment means managing symptoms, such as pain management and strengthening the immune system.

Water Yam (artist's book)

Water Yam is an artist's book by the American artist George Brecht. Originally published in Germany, June 1963 in a box designed by George Maciunas and typeset by Tomas Schmit, it has been re-published in various countries several times since. It is now considered one of the most influential artworks released by Fluxus, the internationalist avant-garde art movement active predominantly in the 1960s and '70s. The box, sometimes referred to as a "Fluxbox" or "Fluxkit", contains a large number of small printed cards, containing instructions known as "event-scores", or "fluxscores". Typically open-ended, these scores, whether performed in public, private or left to the imagination, leave a lot of space for chance and indeterminancy, forcing a large degree of interpretation upon the performers and audience. 
In some cases [event-scores] would arise out of the creation of the object, while in others the object was discovered and Brecht subsequently wrote a score for it, thus highlighting the relationship between language and perception. Or, in the words of the artist, “ensuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.” The event-score was as much a critique of conventional artistic representation as it was a gesture of firm resistance against individual alienation.
The work is considered an important precursor to conceptual art.
The scores.
Early editions of "Water Yam" collected around 70 event-scores together, created over a four-year period from 1959 to 1963. Later editions would add extra events (up to about 100), as well as a small flick book "Nut Bone. A Yamfest Movie", and white-on-black invitations to contact Brecht via a New York PO Box and arrange 'deliveries and relocations'.
Many of the scores had been used in mail art events between 1961 and '63, occasionally hand-written, typed or hectographed, more usually typeset; often signed neatly at the bottom of the card. When Maciunas collected the scores together the typeset style was kept, but the signatures were removed. The reliance on bullet points (•) separating the performances from their title was a feature that remained consistent throughout the versions. The cards are all different sizes.
The scores divide roughly into three sections; the earliest ones, 1959–62, describe events intended to be performed (such as "Solo for Violin, Viola, Cello or Contrabass" • Polish, July 1962); a second group of scores from '62-63 tend towards describing the temporary creation of assemblages; (such as "Chair Event" • on a white chair a grater, tape measure, alphabet, flag, black and spectral colours, April 1962). The third group, also 1962-63, are more personal and abstract; (such as "Thursday" • Thursday, March 1963). When originally published, Maciunas decided to emphasize 14 of the more musical scores (such as the famous "Drip Music"; A source of dripping water and an empty vessel are arranged so that the water falls into the vessel, January 1962) by printing them on orange cards, whilst the rest (such as "Keyhole" •Through either side) were printed on Brecht's more usual plain white card.
Origins of event-scores.
John Cage and the Experimental Composition Classes.
Brecht met the artist Robert Watts at Rutgers University in 1957, and through Watts, Allan Kaprow. The three started to meet regularly for lunch at a local branch of Howard Johnson's, New Jersey. After a meeting with John Cage organised by Brecht whilst the latter was in New Jersey hunting mushrooms, the three men started to attend Cage's Experimental Music Composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York. In the classes, Cage encouraged his students to use chance and games as major elements in the creation of art. 
"George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really came to life in that situation... He became a leader; and immediately he influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg." Allan Kaprow
Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest Happenings, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd "never felt so controlled before." prompting Brecht to pare the scores down to haiku-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed.
As well as Cage's constructive criticism, Brecht was becoming increasingly interested in Marcel Duchamp's theories on art, which he'd written about at length in "Chance-Imagery", a text written in 1957 but only published in 1966 by the Something Else Press. 
It was only while reading Robert Lebel's 1959 monograph on Duchamp and pondering the consequences of the readymade that Brecht truly understood what he was searching for: Just as the readymade is an object lifted from its mere commodity status by being transported into an art context, the "event" would be an act--often a simple one performed daily, such as turning on and off a switch--on which he would cast his spotlight in order to force us to pay attention to it, in order, as the Russian formalists would have said, to "make it strange" and "de-automatize our perception."
An exhibition of Brecht's work held at the Reuben Gallery, October 1959 "Toward Events: An Arrangement" clearly pointed the way: The press release stated that 'art is to become actively rather than passively existent, to be enjoyed as an unfolding experience...works, or 'events,' such as The Dome, The Case, The Cabinet, are presented three dimensionally.' The final piece in the jigsaw, combining a Duchampian love of chance with a scientific belief in art as research, was an ephiphany Brecht had in 1960, in which he decisively separated the artwork from the control of the artist; 
"In the Spring of 1960 ... waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a truly 'event' piece could be drawn from the situation." George Brecht.
The Yam Festival, 1963.
"Yam" was a name thought up by Brecht and Watts in late 1962 to act as an umbrella project 'for all manner of immaterial, experimental, as yet unclassified forms of expression.' Specifically intending to provide a platform for 'art that could not be bought,' the earliest "Yam" events involved mailing event cards and other objects stamped with the word 'Yam', or variations, to friends. Designed to increase anticipation, the project reached a head with a month-long series of events in May, 1963, in New York, Rutger's University and George Segal's farm.
The festival, ('May' backwards), was organised as a wide ranging series of events taking place throughout the month, whose main objective was to bypass traditional gallery outlets, giving artists and 'receivers' greater freedom.
"In all of its formats and strategies Brecht's and Watt's "Yam Festival" operated as an alternative to the gallery system, producing "art" that could not be bought." Julia Robinson
Artists participating in the festival included Alison Knowles, Allan Kaprow, John Cage, Al Hansen, Ay-O, Dick Higgins, La Monte Young, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ray Johnson. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. "Yam" evolved parallel to George Maciunas' "Fluxfests", set up with almost identical aims but currently operating only in Europe whilst Maciunas was stationed in Germany. The International Fluxus Festival of the Newest Music ("Festum Fluxorum"), 1962–63, would feature the work of artists such as Cage, Raoul Hausmann and Nam June Paik. Brecht's event-scores, including the famous "Drip Event", were amongst the pieces Maciunas would perform, along with pieces by Kaprow, Watts, Daniel Spoerri, Robert Filliou, Terry Riley, Emmett Williams and Dick Higgins.
Maciunas in Germany.
Clearly aware of the "Yam Festival", Maciunas brought together 73 of Brecht's event-scores whilst working as a free-lance designer for the US army stationed at Ehlhalten near Wiesbaden, and placed them in a box with a fine example of his graphic design pasted onto the cover. Maciunas referred to the box as 'Brecht's complete works' and intended it to be the first in a series compiling works by artists he admired. Few of these intended 'collected works' ever saw the light of day.The use of multiple fonts derived from his interest in experimental typography by Dada figures such as Hugo Ball and Raoul Hausmann, and was to prove crucial in defining a recognisable style for fluxus products. 
Published in spring 1963, the box was designed to be the cheapest and simplest way of disseminating art, and in keeping with Maciunas' beliefs, was neither numbered nor signed, although later editions would be published as limited, numbered editions. The box is the very first "Fluxkit", and the only published link between Brecht and Watt's "Yam Festival", and Maciunas' "FluxFests".
Later versions.
It has since been re-published a number of times with differing numbers of event-scores, alternate designs on the cover, and housed in various materials, including plastic boxes and wooden ones. It is worth noting that later editions such as the English "Parrot Impressions", 1972, or the "Lebeer Hossmann" edition, 1986, don't include Maciunas' graphic design, and don't include the word "Fluxus" anywhere in or on the work. Ironically, for an object conceived as an "inexpensive, mass-produced unlimited edition (designed) to erode the cultural status of art and to help to eliminate the artist’s ego." and originally sold for $4, early copies are now worth in excess of $1800.

The Women's trap event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on August 11, 2008 at the Beijing Shooting Range Clay Target Field.
The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 3 sets of 25 targets in trap shooting, with 10 targets being thrown to the left, 10 to the right, and 5 straight-away in each set. The shooters could take two shots at each target.
The top 6 shooters in the qualifying round moved on to the final round. There, they fired one additional round of 25 targets, where only one shot could be taken at each target. The total score from all 100 targets was used to determine final ranking. Ties are broken using a shoot-off; additional shots are fired one at a time until there is no longer a tie.

New Georgia counterattack

The New Georgia counterattack was a counterattack on 17–18 July 1943 by mainly Imperial Japanese Army troops against United States Army forces during the New Georgia Campaign in the Solomon Islands. The U.S. and its allies were attempting to capture an airfield constructed by the Japanese at Munda Point on New Georgia.
The Americans landed on New Georgia on 2 July 1943 and made limited gains in their drive toward Munda Point. The objective of the Japanese counterattack was to destroy the American forces on New Georgia by attacking their exposed flank and rear areas. The Japanese succeeded in infiltrating and attacking several isolated outposts in the American rear areas, but failed to inflict significant casualties on the American forces. After the Japanese counterattack was defeated, the Americans and their allies captured the airfield in the Battle of Munda Point.

Ericsson R290

The Ericsson R290 is a combined GSM and satellite phone using the Globalstar satellite network. The R290 was manufactured in the United Kingdom by Ericsson Mobile Communications.
The Globalstar uses a foldable antenna that is the same length as the body of the telephone. The R290 comes in a blue and black case in a style similar to other Ericsson phones of its period. The case incorporates some Gore-Tex weatherproofing, similar to that used in the Ericsson R310s, although less extensive.
The R290 also has a built-in modem for data and fax communication at 9.6 kbit/s in GSM mode and 7.2 kbit/s in satellite mode.
The R290 is somewhat larger than typical, pure GSM phones, measuring x x and weighing (with slim battery). The R290 has relatively brief battery life compared with typical, pure GSM phones of its generation.
Because it uses a non-standard battery voltage, its charging connector is not one of the types commonly seen on other Ericsson handsets. The device was capable of detecting over-voltage from inappropriate charging equipment, and warning the user to disconnect the charger.
The R290 spanned the corporate change from Ericsson to SonyEricsson (when many of Ericsson's other phones were redesigned), being the only combined GSM and satellite phone in their range; it was not rebranded, however.
Operators.
For United Kingdom users, access to the Globalstar network was available when using a Vodafone GSM SIM card. From 2007, the Globalstar network experienced technical problems with its satellites, and the Vodafone arrangement is no longer in place.

American Society of Military Comptrollers

The American Society of Military Comptrollers is a non-profit profession educational and training organization for military and civilian financial managers who support United States military organizations. The society sponsors research, provides professional development programs to keep members abreast of current government accounting, finance, and budget issues. It administers a professional certification examination. The organization also publishes a professional journal called "Armed Forces Comptroller".
History and organization.
American Society of Military Comptrollers (ASMC) was established in 1948 San Antonio, Texas. It was originally called the "Society of Military Accountants and Statisticians", and was only open to active duty military officers. Since then, the organization has grown to include both military officers, enlisted members of the armed forces, and civilian personnel from all the military services in the United States Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard, including persons retired from those categories. It also includes employees of contractors to military organizations. Civilian employees now constitute a majority of all ASMC members. Over the years, the society has also expanded membership to include many comptroller related fields. Today, the organization promotes professional development in general financial management, accounting and finance, budgeting, resource management, auditing, statistics and cost analysis, management analysis, manpower management, program analysis, acquisition management, and comptroller related administrative support activities.
The society’s current membership is approximately 18,000 individual members along with 150 corporate members. There are 150 active chapters located in 43 states. There are also a number of chapters located outside the United States. The organization’s headquarters is in Alexandria, Virginia.
Certification program.
Because defense financial management is complex, military comptrollers are encouraged to seek professional certification. The most common certifications are state administered Certified Public Accountant examinations and the national "Certified Defense Financial Manager" (CDFM) examination which was developed by the American Society of Military Comptrollers.
The CDFM examination is composed of four separate test modules. The first three must be passed to receive basic CDFM certification. The fourth module on acquisition is optional. Those who pass all four modules are identified as CDFM-A. The following is an outline of the topic covered in the four test modules.
Examinations are administered by commercial testing organizations throughout the United States. Each examination module contains a minimum of 80 questions. Candidates are allotted two hours to complete each module. To received the basic certification, an individual must pass the first three module examinations. Individuals who complete all four modules are recognized as "Certified Defense Financial Manager with Acquisition Specialty". CDFM is an important professional credential for military comptrollers.
As with most professional credentials, the CDFM program requires (1) technical examinations; (2) education; (3) experience; (4) continuing professional education; and (5) subscription to a code of professional ethics.
Professional Development Institute.
The purpose of the American Society of Military Comptrollers is to provide professional education and training for military financial managers. To help accomplish this goal, the society hosts an annual "Professional Development Institute", normally lasting four days immediately after Memorial Day. The event provides a forum for recognized experts in various comptroller fields to share their knowledge with fellow practitioners. It also allows senior leaders from the Department of Defense and the military services an opportunity to speak to 3,000 to 4,000 military and (mostly) civilian financial managers about professional value, change in the fiscal environment, and national defense priorities.
Professional publication.
The American Society of Military Comptrollers publishes a quarterly professional journal called the "Armed Forces Comptroller". The purpose of the journal is to encourage professional development and provide a forum for military comptroller personnel to share best practices and new ideas. It also helps keep society members informed of current trends and issues of interest to financial managers working in military organizations. The journal publishes diverse viewpoints on a wide range of comptroller related topics. Because the American Society of Military Comptrollers is a private organization, their journal does not have to reflect the official Government position any given topic. As a result, the "Armed Forces Comptroller" is widely read and respected as a professional publication.
Awards and scholarships.
The American Society of Military Comptrollers sponsors an annual awards program to recognize the outstanding professional accomplishments of military and civilian financial managers working in the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard. Society chapter nominate individuals for awards in various comptroller disciplines. Nominees do not have to be a member of the society to be nominated for an award. Award are presented to recognize outstanding accomplishments in the areas of senior level comptrollership; budgeting; resource management; accounting and finance; analysis and evaluation; auditing; manpower management; education, training and career development; and an exceptional intern or trainee award. Awards are presented at two levels "Distinguished" and "Meritorious". Awards are presented at the society’s annual Professional Development Institute.
The American Society of Military Comptrollers also offer scholarships to high school seniors interested in pursuing a college degree in business, economics, accounting, auditing, computer science, or mathematics. The national organization sponsors eleven scholarships each year. There is one $3,000 scholarship, five $2,000 scholarship, and five $1,000 scholarship. Most local chapters sponsor additional scholarship, some offering as much as $4,000.
The Society also sponsors an annual essay competition. The three winners receive cash awards of $750 for first place, $500 for second place, and $250 for third place. All three winners receive a plaque, presented at the society’s Professional Development Institute. The winning essays are also published in the "Armed Forces Comptroller" magazine.

Surrogate alcohol

Surrogate alcohol is a term for any substance containing ethanol that is consumed but is not meant for consumption. Most people turn to these as a last resort either out of desperation or being unable to afford consumable alcoholic beverages.
Common surrogate alcohols.
Many alcoholic liquids contain alcohol but are not meant to be ingested in the same way as beer, wine or spirits. Typical surrogate alcohols include:
Dangers to health.
Most surrogate alcohols have very high alcoholic levels, some as high as 95%, and thus can lead to alcohol poisoning, along with other symptoms of alcohol abuse such as vertigo, impaired coordination, balance and judgment, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and even long-term effects such as heart failure and stroke.
Besides alcohol, there are many other toxic substances in surrogate alcohol such as hydrogen peroxide, antiseptics, ketones, as well as alcohols other than ethanol (drinking alcohol) such as isopropanol and methanol. Consumption of these can lead to internal hemorrhaging and scarring, ulcers, headaches, CNS depression, blindness, coma, and death.
Russia.
Consumption of surrogate alcohol is a common problem in Russia, contributing to the high rate of alcohol-related deaths in the country. During the Soviet regime, alcoholic beverages were often among the only consumer goods affordable for the general public, leading to rampant alcoholism which is still present in modern Russia. In 1985, Gorbachev instituted alcohol reform, attempting to fight widespread alcoholism by increasing prices and reducing availability. These changes, however, led to the formation of a black market for alcohol, including surrogates. The dissolution of the Soviet Union caused a further spike in alcohol prices, leading more people to cheaper surrogate alcohol.
In Venedikt Yerofeyev's 1970 samizdat novella "Moscow-Petushki", the unreliable narrator shares recipes for a variety of cocktails made with surrogate alcohol.

Gina, Dale Haze and the Champions

Gina, Dale Haze and the Champions are an Irish pop group who formed in 1973 and remained a successful Chart act for the next two decades. They were one of the most popular club acts in Ireland, playing on the showband circuit until their split in 1992. In 2009 they staged a reunion (with all the original members) and they continue to perform at selected venues around Ireland.
Background.
The group, originally from Cork, consisted of a four-piece backing band (The Champions) and two lead singers (Gina and Dale Haze). Female lead, Gina (real name, Mary Hurley) took the vocal duties on most of the singles, while male lead Dale Haze (real name Jerdie Mackey) provided lead vocals on many songs and released a solo album in 1982. Members of the backing group were Pat Walshe, Mossey Walshe, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tony Hornibrook.
They featured regularly in the Irish charts - their biggest hits including "Minnie Minnie", "Do You Wanna Do It", "You're the Greatest Lover", "Who Do You Wanna Be", "Give Me Back My Love" and "Playing with Fire". They were voted Top Irish Pop Band in a number of voters polls over the period also. Briefly during 1985, they shortened their name to "G, D H and C".
The group remained popular on the cabaret circuit and continued to play with the same line-up. In 1992 the group split due to the shift in popularity of the Irish showband genre and concert bookings began to dry up. Gina was also married to member Pat Walshe and after giving birth to her second child suffered post-natal depression and found it difficult to continue. The group never announced a split however and didn't perform a farewell gig. In October 2009, the original line-up reunited for an Irish tour, performing many of their hits. A night at the Cork Opera House was sold out three months in advance. A compilation album "The Best of Gina, Dale Haze and the Champions" was released to tie in with this. In 2012 they released a new CD ""Baby I Love You" and re-mastered a number of their earlier hits to produce 3 new CDs.

<doc id="18653576" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18653576" title="Ecclesfield Priory">
Ecclesfield Priory

Ecclesfield Priory was a religious house of Benedictine monks, lying in the village of Ecclesfield, north of Sheffield in Yorkshire, United Kingdom.
History.
Early history.
Ecclesfield Church and a mill in the village were in the possession of St Wandrille's Abbey in Normandy by 1142, when this was confirmed by a Papal Bull of Pope Innocent II. These were the abbey's most northerly possessions, and probably their most valuable.
There is no written evidence of any building on the site before 1273, but an 1161 agreement between Richard de Louvetot and the Abbey mentions "the monks of Ecclesfield". In 1866, an outer wall of the Priory was uncovered, at the west end of the Chapel. The architect supervising the work claimed that this may have been 12th-century work, but there has been no further investigation of this.
Religious use.
The Priory was in existence by 1273, when it was mentioned in a Papal Bull of Pope Clement IV, again confirming some of the Abbey's possessions. It acted as a cell of the abbey in Normandy. Many writers have assumed that this demonstrates that the surviving structures were built prior to this date, but David Hey notes that it is possible that a 12th-century structure was in use and was only replaced a few years later.
The names of most priors from the early 14th century are known:
In 1357, the Abbey sent two armed messengers to bring Gullielmi back because he had ignored a summons questioning his "evil life and embezzlement of the priory's goods". Fulmere was ejected as he was not ordained, and Burdet was imprisoned in Newgate for threatening Fulmere. Upon his release, Burdet unsuccessfully challenged de Medbourne's appointment in Parliament.
In 1386, the Priory was confiscated from the Abbey during the Hundred Years' War and given to the Priory of St Anne in Coventry. This was a Carthusian house, and did not send monks to Ecclesfield Priory, instead appointing vicars and chaplains. This system survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
The "Valor Ecclesiasticus" of 1535 noted that there was a dwelling house for the vicar, usually presumed to be either the Priory or a neighbouring structure. St Anne's was dissolved in 1539, and in 1542 the right to present vicars and collect tithes in Ecclesfield was purchased by Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury; it then passed through several hands to the Shirecliffe family. They converted the building into a farmhouse under the name Ecclesfield Hall, inserting a fireplace and mullioned windows. The priory chapel and room below were not altered.
Domestic use.
In 1637, John Harrison described "The scite of the mannor, or mansion house called Ecclesfield-hall with all the Out-houses there to belonginge some of them beeing in decay and some fallen downe. Also the orchard, gardens, yard, the conney-greave and the Intack lyinge next unto Ecclesfeild Churchyard..." An inventory of 1691 listed the Hall's rooms as "hall, little parlour adjoining to the hall, milk house, kitchen, brewhouse, oxen house, dining room, closet, buttery, cellar, Chappel parlour, passage, Chappel Chamber, Greene Chamber, passage, Servants Chamber, boulting house, hay lath, fold, stable and Old Chappell." The Hall was greatly extended in 1736. It is uncertain whether any parts of the old building were demolished at this time.
By the Victorian period, the Mediaeval portion had once again become known as "Ecclesfield Priory". Jonathan Eastwood wrote extensively about the Priory in his "History of the Parish of Ecclesfield" of 1862, and the surviving building was restored in 1866 by M. E. Hadfield. The Priory and Hall then became separate houses.
Architecture.
The surviving building consists of a north-south oriented block, with the chapel connected to its south-east corner. It is constructed of sandstone with Millstone Grit dressings and is built directly on the bedrock. The three-storey chapel block is of thinly coursed rubble, while the crosswing is of squared stone and is coursed.
The main block was substantially altered in the 17th century and again in 1866, with windows dating from both periods. One first-floor room has a barrel vaulted ceiling with relief panels, while the original pointed doorway into the chapel survives. The chapel contains more mediaeval work, including original lancet windows, a piscina and an aumbry.
The entire building is Grade II* listed.

The Battle of Munda Point was a battle, from 22 July-4 August 1943, between primarily United States Army and Imperial Japanese Army forces during the New Georgia Campaign in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific War. In the battle, U.S. forces captured a Japanese airfield constructed at Munda Point on New Georgia.
After losing the battle for the airfield, Japanese forces abandoned New Georgia entirely and redeployed to defend nearby Kolombangara. The U.S. employed the airfield in its campaign as part of Operation Cartwheel to isolate the major Japanese base at Rabaul, New Britain.

Music video.
The music video premiered on TRL on September 4, 2008. The music video was directed by Benny Boom. The video takes place at Jet Nightclub at The Mirage in Las Vegas.
The video begins with a girl (portrayed by Yasmin Deliz) arriving in a taxi cab alone. She meets with her friend in front of the Jet Club and they go in together. Inside, the girl, throughout the video, encounters each of the five members of New Kids on the Block. All of them innocently flirt with her. Each time, the girl is very charmed and/or a bit bewildered (due to in some instances, that one or two of the members are turning up in unexpected places wherever she is). This could also signify the theme of the song meaning that despite having no boyfriend there to spend some quality time with her, she does not have to be alone in order to enjoy herself, and that there's always someone there if need be, at least temporarily.
The band and Ne-Yo are seen hanging out together with some girls in the VIP.
The video also features Ne-Yo and New Kids on the Block performing separately, in front of a backdrop.

Javanese dance

Javanese dance is the dances and art forms that were created and influenced by Javanese culture. Javanese dance movement is controlled, deliberate and refined. Javanese art often displays a finesse, and at the same time a serene composure which is elevated far above everything mundane. Javanese dance is usually associated with courtly, refined and sophisticated culture of the Javanese kratons, such as the Bedhaya and Srimpi dance. However, in a wider sense, Javanese dance also includes the dances of Javanese commoners and villagers such as Ronggeng, Tayub, Reog, and Kuda Lumping.
Javanese dance and its discipline has different styles and philosophy compared to other Indonesian dance traditions. Unlike vigorous and expressive Balinese dance or cheerful and slightly sensual Sundanese dance, Javanese dance are commonly involving slow movements and graceful poses. Javanese dance have somewhat a meditative quality and tends to be more self-reflective, introspective and more oriented toward self-understanding. Javanese dance is usually associated with Wayang wong, and the palaces of Yogyakarta and Surakarta due to the nature of dance being a pusaka or sacred heirloom from ancestors of the palace rulers. These expressive dances are more than just dances, they are also used for moral education, emotional expression, and spreading of the Javanese culture.
Types of Javanese Dance.
Javanese dance reflects the stratified hierarchy of Javanese society, and roughly can be identified within two mainstream of traditions:
Tari Kraton.
The courtly Javanese palace dance is the type of dances that developed, nurtured and fostered by Javanese Kratons, mainly Yogyakarta Sultanate and Surakarta Sunanate, the patrons of Javanese Mataram culture. Javanese sultans are known as the patron and the creator of Javanese court dances. 
Kraton dances employs sets of rules about certain dance movements, body and hand gestures that requires discipline to learn. Gamelan orchestra is the prerequisite for Javanese court dance performances as well as for other Javanese art forms such as Wayang performances. The serene elegance, slow pace and constrains of its movements gave Javanese dance a meditative traits. Javanese court dances were heavily influenced by Javanese Hindu-Buddhist legacy. As the result the costumes, jewelry and story, often reflects or based on Hindu epic tales of Ramayana and Mahabharata.
There are three basic types of courtly Javanese kraton dance:
Tari Kawulo.
Also known as "Tari Rakyat", is the popular dances of the commoner. This is the type of Javanese dances that developed in villages or cities that located relatively quite far from Javanese kratons as the center of Javanese palace culture. Kawulo dances is lack in Javanese courtly dance discipline, constraints, and refinements. This type of dance relatively more open and adaptive to foreign influences.
Several dance forms function as courtship or social dance such as Ronggeng, Gandrung and Tayub, while others are celebratory dances such as Reog and Kuda Lumping. The movement of social dances, such as ronggeng and tayub are more vigorous and often erotic, closely related to Sundanese Jaipongan. Because of the erotic nuances, those who perform this type of dance are sometimes perceived as intentionally being suggestive or even openly advertising sexual favors.

Parents Anonymous

Parents Anonymous (PA) is a self-help group for parents who may or may not have abused their children. PA was founded in 1967 by a 29 year-old single mother, Jolly K. and psychiatric social worker Leonard L. Lieber. Jolly K. was under Lieber's care at the time, and he suggested she meet with another parent from his caseload who had similar issues. The organization grew slowly until it received a grant from the Office of Child Development and Health Education and Welfare in 1974. Unlike traditional twelve-step programs PA mandates professional involvement, accepts funding from outside sources, but does emphasize the importance of protecting members anonymity and never charges parents a fee, dues or charge for attending. The PA "Chapter Development Manual" requires each chapter have professional facilitator who "should be a professional person from a 'helping' field with a profound respect for the self-help concept." Parents Anonymous publishes a periodical, "Frontiers", and several manuals in addition to the "Chapter Development Manual".

Elton railway station is a former railway station in Elton, Cambridgeshire on former Northampton and Peterborough Railway which connected Peterborough with Northampton via Wellingborough. 
The heritage Nene Valley Railway have aspirations of extending towards the site of Elton and onward to as far as a possible, new site at Oundle within the near future.
History.
The station opened in 1847 and closed in 1953 to passengers. In 1846 the line, along with the London and Birmingham, became part of the London and North Western Railway. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
Elton was the last station along the line before crossing the border into Northamptonshire towards Oundle.

Oundle railway station

Oundle railway station is a former railway station in Oundle, Northamptonshire on the former Northampton and Peterborough Railway line which connected Peterborough and Northampton. In 1846 the line, along with the London and Birmingham, became part of the London and North Western Railway. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
History.
The stations on this line were probably the most extravagant of any. They were designed by J.W.Livock and constructed in the Jacobean style from local stone. Originally the line was single and the Station house was of two stories with three gable ends facing on to the platform. The line was doubled in 1846 and a second platform contained simply a waiting room.
In common with stations built on this line at this time the sidings on either side were accessed by wagon turntables connected by a line across the running lines at right angles to them. The platforms were offset and this line ran between them, with a large goods shed adjacent to the main building. Later a further running line was added in the Peterborough direction and more sidings were added curving away into a new goods yard, using double slips off the running lines 
Initially there were three trains a day, rising to six by 1883. Since the station lay outside the town an omnibus or post horse could be hired from the Talbot Hotel. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
Oundle was also the location of a substantial boarding school and special trains ran even after regular timetabled services finished in 1964. British Railways finally closed the line in November 1972. 
The section from Yarwell Junction to Wansford was taken over by the Nene Valley Railway but unfortunately Oundle was not included and the rails were lifted in the 1970s. 
However the heritage Nene Valley Railway (Wansford/Peterborough) still hope to acquire at least 2 or 3 miles to a new site at Oundle (as the old original station itself is now a private residence) within the near future (putting oundle itself back on the map)

International Harvester strike of 1979–1980

The International Harvester strike of 1979–1980 was a strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) against the International Harvester (IH) company over work rules. The strike began on November 1, 1979, and ended after 172 days on April 20, 1980. As of May 2008, it was the fourth-longest strike of national importance ever held by the UAW.
Background.
Previous bargaining history.
The UAW first negotiated a master contract with International Harvester in 1950. At the time, there was no mandatory overtime and both management and the union believed that the company could not request mandatory overtime. The 1950 master contract also codified an existing practice whereby a worker could transfer to any other job in the company provided he or she was the most senior applicant for the position.
During the 1958 contract renewal talks, IH attempted to restrict job transfer rights. The union struck for nine weeks, and IH dropped the demand in exchange for other concessions.
Between 1961 and 1976, four of the six three-year contracts were signed only after the union struck—although each of the strikes was short, lasting from two hours to two-and-a-half weeks. There were also a large number (more than 100) wildcat strikes during this period. After a 15-day strike in 1973, the union agreed to include a side letter into the contract in which the union agreed to encourage employees to voluntarily agree to work overtime (with advance notice, and only up to seven Saturdays a year)—although few employees ever volunteered.
By the late 1970s, International Harvester had come to believe that unlimited transfer rights were being abused and creating productivity problems. The company also instituted a new disciplinary program to crack down on wildcat strikes, and outlasted one UAW local when it engaged in a five-week-long wildcat strike in 1978 in an attempt to have the program withdrawn.
McCardell takes over.
In 1979, International Harvester was the fourth-largest company in the United States.
Archie McCardell was appointed president and chief operating officer of International Harvester in August 1977, named chief executive officer in January 1978, and chairman of the board in June 1979. He was charged with shaking up the family-run company to increase profitability. He received a then-exorbitant salary of $460,000 (making him one of the highest-paid CEOs in the country), a $1.5 million signing bonus and a $1.8 million loan at 6 percent interest. He instituted an aggressive cost-cutting program which immediately cut spending by $640 million and a modernization program which poured $879 million over three years into the company's plants. His actions boosted market share, and led to record sales of $8.4 billion and record profits of $370 million (up from $203 million). Despite McCardell's actions, IH's profit margins were still only half those of competitors like Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Company.
Among the many changes McCardell made was to fire 11,000 of the company's 15,000 mid- and upper-level managers, whom McCardell felt were too close to UAW shop stewards. McCardell took personal control of IH's labor relations, and appointed a new vice president of human resources, W. Grant Chandler (who was to assist McCardell in all union negotiations). McCardell's actions stripped the company of nearly all its experienced labor negotiators, and those who remained were mostly ignored during the upcoming round of negotiations. McCardell and Chandler had little labor relations experience, however, and none in heavy manufacturing or in negotiating with the UAW.
Early negotiations.
Negotiations opened on August 9, 1979, in Chicago, Illinois. UAW International Vice President Pat Greathouse and two veteran IH negotiators—Art Shy, and Cletus Williams—led a union bargaining team composed of 20 representatives from 51 IH local unions. Among the proposed changes to the contract that the union proposed was that the union contract be automatically extended to any new plants opened by International Harvester—essentially allowing the union to organize new workers without holding an election.
Instead of a similar long list of demands (which the company had traditionally countered with in the past), Chandler gave the union only seven demands and advised it that these proposals must be dealt with, strike or no strike. The proposals were aimed at largely ending job transfers and seniority, adding five shifts a week, and instituting a mandatory overtime scheme; the company claimed it had lost $1.3 billion over the previous three years over these issues. Many companies in turnaround seek to improve product design and production processes, and managerial expertise before seeking labor concessions. But McCardell concluded that the fastest way to achieve cost savings was to persuade workers to accept work rules changes which would have cost employees $100 million. Surprisingly, however, IH agreed to match the pay increase pattern set earlier in the year by automobile manufacturers in Detroit.
Despite the concession, these early negotiations did not go well. McCardell and Chandler were inexperienced negotiatiors, not picking up on the private signals the union sent and did not understand the importance of the signals when they did become aware of them. Even company-side negotiators complained about the inexperience of McCardell and Chandler, arguing that this inexperience lessened the company's ability to divine the union's real bargaining positions. When McCardell and Chandler were not at the bargaining table, negotiators who were present had no real authority to bargain on behalf of the company. Combined, these two factors significantly hindered IH's bargaining abilities. As one scholar pointed out: "There was no sense that the company negotiators had the capacity to understand the industry, the union's positions, or the politics that these leaders faced; neither were these negotiators truly free to develop that understanding."
Other company actions unintentionally hardened negotiating positions and decreased trust between the two parties. The company moved the negotiations out of a neutral local hotel and into management conference rooms, limited informal side conversations (which had been used in the past to explore compromises), refused to build social ties with the union bargainers, refused to informally signal their true intentions, and ignored symbolic issues (one IH negotiator wore a silk suit to negotiations, which offended the blue-collar negotiators).
International Harvester also unintentionally disempowered the union negotiators, making it harder for them to agree to company demands. For example, the company repeatedly went public with its bargaining proposals, which made it harder for company negotiators to back down later and reach compromises. The company's "match the pay pattern" announcement also had the effect of depriving union leaders of the ability to claim a "win" in negotiations by claiming they had achieved a pay raise—making it harder for union negotiators to "sell" more hard-to-swallow compromises later, and forcing the union to entrench itself to achieve gains in other areas.
The talks recessed after just one day.
Less than a week later, International Harvester reported on August 15, 1979, record sales and earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1979. Year-to-year net earnings for the third quarter rose $1.12 per share to $2.19, and the year-to-year third quarter dividend raised 5 cents to 62.5 cents. Net income for the quarter rose to $67.91 million, an 89 percent increase over the same period last year, and net income for the first three quarters of the year was $221.9 million, a 95 percent increase over the previous year. The company said prospects for the final quarter also looked strong.
Bargaining resumed on August 21, 1979.
International Harvester's behavior at and away from the bargaining table, coupled with the company's exceedingly positive economic news, hardened the UAW's bargaining position. On September 14, 1979, the UAW said it would strike all heavy-equipment manufacturers it was negotiating with if new collective bargaining agreements were not reached. The UAW's contract at International Harvester expired on October 1, 1979. But despite the union's more rigid stands, a council of all 51 IH local unions agreed to extend the contract on a day-to-day basis as negotiations continued.—a decision opposed by the international union.
In late October, IH received mixed signals about the Auto Workers' intentions and capabilities. On October 18, the union reached a new three-year agreement with Deere & Co. after an 18-day strike by 31,000 employees, while at the same time 23,000 of Caterpillar's 40,000 workers engaged in a wildcat strike to protest the slow pace of negotiations at that company. Six days later, the union made it clear it would strike IH if no agreement was reached, but IH officials merely reiterated that their seven demands must be met. Another 17,000 Caterpillar workers struck on October 28, and IH officials suggested that the UAW would be too financially exhausted and organizationally stretched too thin to engage in a third strike. International Harvester refused to budge on its demand for mandatory overtime.
Strike.
The union did strike, however. On November 1, 1979, 35,000 UAW workers (36 percent of International Harvester's workforce) at 21 plants in eight states—Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas—struck International Harvester at noon rather than accept the new work rules and mandatory overtime provisions. But McCardell was not alarmed, seeing the strike as a way to challenge the union's power in the workplace and as an opportunity to improve efficiency by regaining concessions the company had made in the past.
For nearly a month, no talks were held. The two sides met briefly on Monday, November 26, for roughly an hour, but no progress was made. Thereafter, the union stepped up its pressure on the company. Bargaining reopened on December 13. As the talks resumed, the UAW settled the strike at Caterpillar, ending what was then the longest strike in history against that heavy-equipment manufacturer. Nonetheless, talks broke off December 15, the same day the Caterpillar strike ended. Days later, International Harvester announced a year-to-year increase of 98 percent in its profits for the entire fiscal year. Yearly earnings reached a record $369.9 million, and sales rose a 25.9 percent to reach a record $8.4 billion. Net income nearly doubled to $12.01 a share (up from $6.14 a share). But on January 10, 1980, the company said that losses in the first quarter of the year (November 1979 to January 1980) could be as high as $225 million (or 10 percent of the company's shareholders' equity) if the strike continued. To help weather the strike, International Harvester's top 25 officers took 20 percent salary cuts, travel expenses were curtailed, meetings were cancelled or moved to company offices, the budget for the annual stockholders' meeting scaled back, advertising spending curtailed, capital spending slashed by $100 million (to $400 million), and a new line of credit established to provide access to emergency funds (if needed). McCardell, however, vowed to continue to seek agreement on the company's seven demands.
In mid-December 1980, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette quoted an internal International Harvester memorandum (written in January 1979) in which the company appeared to advocate manufacturing plant decentralization as part of a plan to break the union. The memo specifically mentioned a new IH plant to be built in Wagoner, Oklahoma (a right-to-work state) which would eliminate unionized jobs at the company's Fort Wayne plant. The memo said the Wagoner plant was only the first step in a scheme to slowly dismantle the Fort Wayne plant. The memo outraged the union, which felt the company had intended to bargain in bad faith over its contract extension proposal.
The company's tendency to go public with negotiating positions led to further entrenchment on both sides, and no talks were scheduled for most of January.
While International Harvester was forced to cut costs, the United Auto Workers improved its financial position. On January 30, 1980, the union gave striking workers a $15-a-week across-the-board increase in strike benefits, raising the benefit to $55 a week for a single worker and $65 a week for married workerd with dependents.
The company and union resumed talks on February 4, 1980, but the discussions ended after just one day. IH modified its overtime proposal to require worker consent, and asked the union to create a group of part-time employees who would be mandated to work overtime when not enough regulartime employees could be found to work. The union rejected the proposal without explanation and walked out of the talks. The strike, by now the longest in International Harvester's history as well as the longest in UAW history (surpassing the old record of 117 days), resumed and the union threatened to stay on the picket line until March if necessary. Industry analysts worried that IH would begin to lose market share as its inventories dropped.
As the annual company shareholders' meeting approached, the union accused International Harvester of attempting to prevent union members' attendance. The United Auto Workers, which owned six shares of Harvester stock, accused the company of deliberately selecting a meeting hall which was too small to accommodate the number of union members who would be voting those shares and issuing too-few tickets to permit admission for the union members. The union filed an injunction in United States district court to force International Harvester to admit its members.
Days before the shareholder meeting, International Harvester reported a first-quarter loss of $222.2 million. The company also admitted that unfilled orders of $4.2 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year earlier, and attributed the loss and backlog to the effects of the strike. Despite the loss, the company still paid a dividend of 62.5 cents a share for the quarter.
The annual shareholders' meeting, held at the First Chicago Center in Chicago on February 21, was described by the press as "turbulent." On February 20, the union obtained a court order requiring International Harvester to set up closed-circuit television facilities so members of the UAW and other shareholders could observe the meeting. The overflow room was at a hotel several blocks away. But when the meeting opened with about 200 seats still empty, McCardell delayed proceedings for an hour as 175 UAW members were brought from the hotel to the First Chicago Center. The UAW bitterly attacked McCardell throughout the proceedings. Cletus Williams, chairman of the UAW's negotiating committee, accused McCardell of manipulating the shareholders' meeting so that many UAW members didn't know they could attend until it was too late. Despite the rancorous shareholders' meeting, bargainers resumed talks that same day. IH once more altered its overtime proposal, suggesting that employees be required to work up to 14 Saturdays a year and establishing a voluntary pool of part-time workers to fill in shifts when not enough full-time workers volunteered to work a particular Saturday shift. But the company withdrew its proposal when the union declared its opposition.
IH's financial situation worsened on March 6, 1980, when Moody's Investors Services downgraded the company's short-term bond credit rating from Prime 1 to Prime 2. The company estimated the downgrade would cost it $4 million in profits by the end of the fiscal year. In yet another cost-cutting move, 8,000 of the company's 10,000 salaried and management employees were forced to take a week's vacation due to low workloads. Rumors of yet another management pay cut came amid signs that the company was planning to sell its construction equipment business to raise money.
But talks did not break off after resuming during the annual shareholder's meeting. Mounting losses and the arrival of farm implement sales season kept the company at the bargaining table and led to agreements on a short-term layoff provision and the job-transfer issue. Negotiators agreed to negotiate over local matters affecting each plant and settle these before returning to the more contentious national issues. Six local unions quickly settled their local issues.
On March 18, 1980, negotiators for both sides announced they had reached a tentative agreement on the mandatory overtime issue. According to the Associated Press, full-time workers and retirees could volunteer to become part of a special overtime pool which could be drawn from to fill vacant weekend work shifts. Seniority, holiday pay and the ability of piece workers to go home after fulfilling their quotas were still outstanding. Forty-two locals had also settled their local issues contracts during the previous week, leaving only six large locals with outstanding agreements.
Amid calls to submit the unfinished tentative agreements to the membership for ratification and halt the strike, the 300 members of the International Harvester council of 51 local unions overwhelmingly rejected any such proposals. Because the job transfer, new plant contract extension, and the piece worker issues were all still outstanding, the council felt it could not recommend ratification. With six of IH's largest local unions still negotiating, International vice president Pat Greathouse announced that the UAW was breaking off talks at the national level in order to focus on these local contracts. The company agreed, feeling the six large locals—located in East Moline and Rock Island, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Springfield, Ohio; and Louisville, Kentucky—were "the key" to ending the strike.
The council's decision not to recommend ratification lead to a break in the UAW's hierarchy. The day after the decision, Cletus Williams, chairman of the UAW bargaining council, announced that his union—Local 1357 in Canton, Illinois—would take a non-binding vote on the unfinished contract by the end of the weekend. But on Sunday, March 22, 1980, members of Local 1357 rejected Williams' plan to conduct a non-binding vote.
Although the East Moline and Rock Island locals settled their local contracts in the next week, local issue bargaining collapsed after three days. The job transfer issue prevented resolution of the remaining four local contracts. The company believed that if these four local contracts could be settled, the strike would end. Company and union negotiators recommitted themselves to the bargaining process, and an agreement was reached at three more plants the following week The final plant settled its local contact on April 14. National contract talks resumed the following day.
End of the strike.
After two days of bargaining, International Harvester and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on the national master contract on April 16, 1980.
The UAW ratified the three-year contract by a vote of 15,494 in favor and 3,877 against on April 19, 1980. Local 1309 in Rock Island, Ill., and Local 1077 in Shadyside, Ohio, rejected the master agreement apparently because they disagreed with the plan to gradually resume work; those locals remained independently on strike.
The agreement on mandatory overtime provided for little more than the 1973 side letter had already gained for the company.
The contentious issue of limitations on the number and type of job transfers was dropped from the master contract and addressed to varying degrees in plant-level agreements. Limitations varied widely. In one plant, employees could make no more than five transfer requests at one time (files would be purged every six months), there were no restrictions on transfers to higher-paying jobs, and lateral and downward transfer requests were limited to six a year. At other plants, a few stricter limitations were set, such as limiting transfers to one every 90 days. But industry analysts agreed that these were marginal gains.
IH also agreed to extend the union contract to only one new plant. The pact only covered the proposed facility in Wagoner, Okla. While union members would be given preference for jobs at Wagoner, they would lose their seniority and would have to accept the Wagoner plant's pay and fringe benefits (which remained to be negotiated).
UAW chief negotiator Pat Greathouse called the contract an "overwhelming victory" for UAW members.
Nearly all independent commentators saw the agreement as a losing proposition for International Harvester. The company had incurred deep financial costs, lost market share, and achieved none of its key demands despite McCardell's assertions that the proposals were critical to the company's success. "here is no question the company is the big loser in this one," one Wall Street analyst said.
The strike lasted 172 days, at the time making it (at the time) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with bargaining demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority and the lack of mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike. The seeming arrogance of top company officials is considered by many to be a serious strategic error. Company officials seemed surprised that the union could hold out for any length of time, and McCardell appeared to assume that the international union staff (not rank and file members) were pushing for a strike.
Aftermath.
International Harvester incurred significant delays in resuming operations. Plants in Rock Island and East Moline took several weeks to resume work. Several small UAW-represented craft unions which were not part of the master contract talks continued to strike at IH's Louisville plant. The large blue-collar locals refused to cross the picket line (which was their right under the contract), keeping the plant shut.
The strike severely impacted the company's financial status. International Harvester lost $257.2 million in the second quarter, for a total of $479.4 million in the first half of the year, while sales slid 47.3 percent. The company confirmed earlier rumors and put its Scout utility vehicle division up for sale to help cover the losses, and by the end of April 1980 was forced to take out loans which increased its short-term debt from $442 million to a staggering $1 billion.
International Harvester never recovered from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. Rising interest rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 1979–1980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years.
On May 3, 1982, one day after the UAW ratified the concessionary contract, Archie McCardell was fired by International Harvester. Although McCardell asserted he had resigned, industry and press observers said that he was fired. "Time" reported that the company's 16-member board of directors met in a two-hour meeting over the weekend. Pushed by the company's debtor banks, the board finally agreed to fire McCardell. "The real wonder was that McCardell had not been ousted much earlier," "Time" said.
The company's downard financial spiral continued. For fiscal year 1980, 1981, and 1982, International Harvester incurred a combined three-year loss of $2.4 billion—the largest such three-year loss for any American company in history at the time. International Harvester sold its farm equipment division to Tenneco in 1985, and changed its name in 1986 to Navistar International.
Pat Greathouse retired from the UAW in May 1980.

The Monastir Synagogue () is a historic synagogue of the once vibrant Jewish community in Thessaloniki.
History.
The synagogue was built in 1927 by Jews from Monastir in the former Yugoslavia and consecrated by the Chief Rabbi of Thessaloniki, Chaim Raphael Habib.
During World War II, the synagogue was saved by being requisitioned by the Red Cross. In June 1978, the structure of the building was severely damaged by an earthquake. It was restored by the Greek government and today is used primarily during the high holidays.
The synagogue is no longer in regular function. There is a new one shared with the Rabbinate and the offices of the Jewish Community of Thessaloniki at Tsimiki Street downtown. The Jewish museum is also near this new location.

Colorado State Highway 392

State Highway 392 is a long state highway in northern Colorado. SH 392 begins at a junction with U.S. Highway 287 south of Fort Collins and proceeds eastward. It intersects I-25 at Exit 262 and continues east through the towns of Windsor and Lucerne. The highway continues northeast and serves several small towns. The highway nominally ends north of Briggsdale at SH 14 where it becomes Weld County Road 77.
Route description.
The route begins at south of Fort Collins, Colorado along Robert Benson Lake. The road then intersects CR 13 and CR 11, where it briefly enters Redmond before entering the Fossil Creek Regional Open Space, along which is located the Fossil Creek Reservoir. As the road continues eastward through the park, it becomes the southern boundary before interchanging with .
East of I-25, the road briefly continues through farmland before crossing the Larimer/Weld county line. Afterwards, it meets SH 257 in Windsor, nearing Windsor Lake. The road then continues through rectangularly shaped fields before meeting , where it curves slightly southeastward. As the road continues eastward, the fields become circular, and the road turns slightly northeastward. The surrounding land then becomes barren grassland as the road abruptly turns eastward then sharply northward. The road then meets its terminus several miles later at SH 14 in Briggsdale.
History.
The route was established in 1949, where it began at SH 257 in Windsor and continued east to Barnesville. The road was then paved entirely by 1958, then extended to today's I-25 in 1960. The route was then extended east to Cornish; this section was paved by 1977. The route was then extended to its current terminus at Briggsdale at SH 14 the next year. In 1994, the section east of SH 37 (now deleted) was deleted.
In 2007, the section between U.S. Highway 287 and I-25 was added to SH 392 and the formerly deleted section was readded.

Auburn High School Tigers

The Auburn High School Tigers are the athletic teams which represent Auburn High School in Auburn, Alabama. Auburn High School's athletics program fields twenty-one varsity teams as a member of the large-school classification (6A) of the Alabama High School Athletic Association. The Tigers' school colors are royal blue and white and the school's mascot is a tiger named Samford.
AHS's track and field teams have won fourteen state championships, while the cross country squad has won seven state titles. The golf teams have won five state championships since 2004. Auburn High's women's and men's basketball teams have each won a state title, in 1919 and 2005, respectively, while the baseball squad won titles in 1986, 2009, and 2010. Overall, the Auburn High Tigers have won 45 state championships since the program fielded its earliest teams around 1910.
The Auburn High School Tigers are generally referred to as the Auburn Tigers when context precludes confusion with the Auburn University Tigers.
Varsity sports.
Auburn High School currently fields a varsity team in eleven men's and ten women's sports. They are:
Football.
Football was one of the first sports organized at Auburn High, with the first game being played in 1911. In the nine seasons between 1915 and 1923, Auburn High lost only 5 of 62 games, scoring unbeaten records in 1915, 1918, 1919, 1921, and 1923. The Tigers also had unbeaten regular seasons in 1934, 1952, 2008, and 2009—Auburn's nine unbeaten seasons rank second among class 6A schools in Alabama. AHS's overall record of 534–354–33 is the sixth–winningest overall record in 6A.
Auburn High's football team competes in Region 3 of class 6A along with Central High School of Phenix City, Dothan, Enterprise, Northview High of Dothan, Opelika, and Smiths Station High Schools. AHS's primary football rival is the Opelika High School Bulldogs from nearby Opelika, Alabama. Auburn and Opelika have played 84 times, including each year since 1933. Auburn also has traditional rivalries with Central High School of Phenix City (46 games), Lanett High School (44 games), and Valley High School (51 games). The Tigers had previous rivalries with Sidney Lanier High School in the 1910s and Columbus and Jordan High Schools of Columbus, Georgia in the 1920s and 1930s.
Since 2004, Auburn High has produced more All-Pro National Football League players than any other high school. AHS alumni in the NFL include Marcus Washington of the Washington Redskins (Pro Bowl 2005), Osi Umenyiora of the New York Giants (Pro Bowl 2006, 2008), and Demarcus Ware of the Dallas Cowboys (Pro Bowl 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010). Auburn High's Dee Finley was a USA Today All-American in 2007, as was Philip Yost in 1999.
Auburn High has twice been ranked first in the state (in 1967 and 2009) and rose to 17th nationally in the USA Today rankings in 2009. The Tigers proceeded deepest into the playoffs in 2001 and 2009, when the team reached the semifinal round. AHS has won the region, area or conference championship on twenty occasions since 1921: in 1922, 1923, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929, 1934, 1937, 1940, 1948, 1952, 1967, 1972, 1973, 1987, 1990, 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
The football team's home field since 1968 is 8,310 seat Duck Samford Stadium. AHS previously played at Felton Little Park (1949—1968), Auburn Stadium (1939–1947), Drake Field (1911–1920, 1935–1939), and Ross Field (1921–1935). The head coach of the Tigers is Tim Carter, who is 57–15 with six playoff appearances in his six years as AHS coach. Carter replaced Robert Maddox, who in three years at Auburn led the team to three playoff appearances and a region title in 2004. Football games are broadcast on the radio and over the Internet by station WAUD AM 1230 and WTGZ FM 93.9.
Basketball.
Basketball was the first sport organized at Auburn High, with the first recorded men's match in the 1910–1911 season and the first recorded women's game in 1917. Two state championships have been won by AHS: the women claimed the 1919 state title, while the men won the 2005 crown. The 1919 women's squad were undefeated in–state, playing with men's rules (five-player) on outdoor courts; that team's Margaret Brown, Mary Tamplin, and Alice Beasley later led Auburn University to three straight undefeated seasons. The 2005 men's team won the state tournament with a 59–35 defeat of previously unbeaten and USA Today's nationally 2nd–ranked LeFlore.
The men's basketball program is coached by 28-year veteran Frank Tolbert, who holds a 650–315 record. Under Tolbert, Auburn has won the region championship twelve times, reached the playoffs twenty-one times, and the state final four seven times. In addition to the squad's 2005 state title, Auburn High has been state runner-up in 1924, 1987, 1991, and 1996.
The women's basketball program began sometime around 1914, but only lasted for about 15 years before being canceled amidst the cutbacks of the Great Depression. Alabama law later prohibited state high schools from fielding women's basketball teams, but a 1975 repeal of that law allowed Auburn High to bring back women's basketball in 1978. The modern program's first coach was current AHS men's coach Frank Tolbert. Head coach of the women's basketball team is Terryland Dawson. Dawson's 2007 and 2008 squads both made the state tournament regionals, having generated 26–7 and 25–5 records, respectively.
Both basketball squads compete in Area 7 of class 6A along with Central of Phenix City, Opelika, and Smiths Station high schools. The basketball teams play at the 1,500 seat Auburn Fieldhouse on the Auburn High campus. Basketball games are broadcast on the radio and over the Internet by station WAUD AM 1230.
Baseball.
The Auburn High baseball Tigers trace their lineage back to teams which played at least as early as 1912. A school baseball team was still playing as late as 1923, but by the late 1930s had been replaced by a team playing in an FFA league. By 1947, Auburn High again fielded a team. The baseball Tigers have won three state titles, in 1986, 2009, and 2010, and were state runners-up in 1973.
Matt Cimo is the head coach of the AHS baseball team. Auburn High has reached the state playoffs eleven of the past thirteen years, reaching the semifinals in 1998 and 2001 in addition to state championships in 2009 and 2010. The most notable player produced by the Auburn High School baseball program is pitcher Joe Beckwith, who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1979–1983, 1986) and Kansas City Royals (1984–1985).
The baseball team competes in Area 7 of class 6A along with Central of Phenix City, Opelika, and Smiths Station high schools. The baseball team plays at Sam Welborn Field. Baseball games are broadcast on the radio and over the Internet by station WAUD AM 1230.
Softball.
Until 2009, Auburn High softball team was coached by 15–year veteran Ed Crum, under whom the Tigers have a 393-250 record. AHS softball competes in Area 7 of class 6A along with Central of Phenix City, Opelika, and Smiths Station high schools. Auburn High softball plays home matches at the five–field Auburn Softball Complex The softball head coach is Chris Spencer.
Golf.
Auburn High has fielded a men's golf program since at least 1969, while women's golf, started in the late 1990s, is AHS's newest sport. The men's golf team won four team state championships, in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Under 15–year veteran coach Duke Smith, the Tigers have won nine sectional championships (1997, 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), and were state runners–up in 1999. The men's golf program has produced four individual state titles, Bob Dumas in 1969 and 1970, John Oswalt in 2004, and Lowery Thomas in 2005. The AHS women's golf squad won the state title in 2010, and placed second at the state tournament in 2007, 2008, and 2009, with additional top–five finishes in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2006.
The men's golf team competes in Section 2 of class 6A along with Carver, Jeff Davis, Sidney Lanier, and Robert E. Lee High Schools of Montgomery, Central High School of Phenix City, Dothan and Northview High Schools of Dothan, Enterprise, Opelika, Prattville, Russell County, Smiths Station, Stanhope Elmore, and Wetumpka High Schools.

Auburn High's official home golf course is Indian Pines Golf Course, though the Auburn University Club and the Robert Trent Jones–designed Grand National are often used as home courses.
Athletics.
Track and other running sports have been offered at Auburn High since 1921, when AHS won Alabama's first state track and field championship meet. The Tigers six track family sports—men's and women's outdoor track, men's and women's indoor track, and men's and women's cross country—have combined for twenty state championships.
Track and Field.
The Auburn men's track and field team is the oldest of Auburn's track family sports, having been founded prior to 1921 and fielded continually since 1966, while the women's track and field team was first formed in 1975. The men's squad has won ten state titles: 1921, 1923, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 2013. Auburn's seven consecutive tiles between 1965 and 1971 is the state record for men's track. The Auburn women's track team won the state crown in 1986. Men's and women's teams also compete in Alabama's winter indoor track season. The men's indoor track squad has won four state titles, in 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971. Auburn High's Steve Bear won the state decathlon in 1970.

Traditions.
Fight songs.
Auburn High School's primary fight song is "Hooray for Auburn!". The lyrics to "Hooray for Auburn!" come from a cheer that was commonly used in the mid-twentieth century. In 1961, Auburn High School band director Tommy Goff wrote music to fit those lyrics to create the current fight song. In subsequent years, the fight song was adopted by other schools, including Prattville High School and Opelika High School. At football games, "Hooray for Auburn!" is played after a touchdown.
"Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn"—often simply "Glory"—was Auburn High's fight song before "Hooray for Auburn!" was written in 1961 and is currently a secondary fight song of Auburn High. "Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn" has the tune of the chorus of the "Battle Hymn of the Republic", while the lyrics are identical to those of the University of Georgia's "Glory, Glory" but substitute the word "Auburn" for "Georgia". At football games, "Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn" is played after a successful PAT conversion.
For the 1955 football season, Auburn High used the Alabama Polytechnic Institute fight song "War Eagle". An earlier school song, "Auburn Loyalty", was used from the 1920s through the 1940s. "Auburn Loyalty" has the melody of "Illinois Loyalty".
Mascot.
Auburn High's mascot is the tiger. The tiger was chosen because of its association with Auburn in Oliver Goldsmith's 1770 poem "The Deserted Village". The first line of the poem is "Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain", while a later line describes Auburn as, "where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey."
Auburn High's costumed mascot is Samford, an anthropomorphic tiger. Samford was created in 1995 and named for three symbols of the school: Samford Avenue, which runs by the school; Duck Samford Stadium, Auburn High's football stadium; and Samford Hall, the most prominent building in Auburn. Kari Pierce was the first Samford in 1995.

Postage stamps and postal history of Oltre Giuba

Oltre Giuba, Italian for "Jubaland" () or Juba Valley (), formerly Trans-Juba, is the southwesternmost part of Somalia, on the far side of the Juba River (thus "Trans"-Juba), bordering on Kenya.
Italy issued its first postage stamps for Jubaland on July 29, 1925, consisting of contemporary Italian stamps overprinted "OLTRE GIUBA" (Trans-Juba). The same process was followed for the Italian commemorative issues of the time – the "Victor Emmanuel" issue, the "St. Francis" issue. On April 21, 1926, Italy issued a set of seven stamps printed specifically for the colony, depicting a map of the territory and inscribed "COMMISSARIATO GENLE / DELL' OLTRE GIUBA", then on June 1 the omnibus Colonial Institute issue included a set inscribed "OLTRE GIUBA".
Only a couple of the higher values have more than a minimal price for collectors, although as usual for remote colonies of brief existence, genuine usages on cover are seldom seen.

<doc id="18653978" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18653978" title="Cygnet Cinema">
Cygnet Cinema

Cygnet Cinema is located at 16 Preston Street, Como, Western Australia. It was the first purpose built sound cinema in the suburbs immediately south of the city in the inter-war period. The Cygnet Cinema opened in 1938 and was built by local identity and film entrepreneur James Stiles. It is an excellent example of the art deco style of architect William Leighton and is included on the State’s Heritage Register.
History.
The Cygnet Theatre, built in 1938 for James Stiles of the Grand Theatre Company, was originally named the Como Theatre. Formerly a real estate agent, Stiles moved into the cinema industry to save one of his assets, Grand Theatre, which faced ruin in the wake of the stock market crash in 1929. With the boom in cheap entertainment, the Grand Theatre Company soon became a very successful company. In 1938, Stiles managed to secure a ten year lease on Piccadilly Theatre, modernised his existing cinemas and built Como Theatre.
In the late 1930s South Perth had developed as a desirable, respectable riverside suburb. Como Beach was a popular recreation area for families, and a ferry service to the city left from the Como jetty at the bottom end of Preston Street.
The 1930s were also a boom period for entertainment. Attending the cinema was a popular pastime and an escape from the poverty of the Depression. A number of cinemas were built, not only in the city centres of Perth or Fremantle, but also in the suburbs. The Cygnet Theatre was not the first cinema in the South Perth area. It was preceded by the picture shows held twice weekly at the Swan Street Hall (1922), the Gaiety Picture Theatre on the corner of Coode and Angelo Streets (1926) and the Hurlingham Picture Theatre on Canning Highway (1933). The Gaiety and Hurlingham were still in operation when the Como Theatre opened in 1938 as the most modern and up-to-date-cinema in the district, screening "talkies" for the first time. 
The Como Theatre was officially opened on 4 March 1938, by the Chairman of the South Perth Road Board, G.V. Abjornson. It was designed by William T. Leighton, the well known Inter-War architect, and built by W H Ralph and Sons. In the late 1930s Leighton secured a reputation as a leading cinema designer for his work on several Perth cinemas, including the Piccadilly Theatre and Arcade, the Windsor Theatre in Nedlands, and the Astor Theatre in Mount Lawley. He was also behind the refurbishment of the Royal Theatre and Grand Theatre. Como Theatre originally had both an indoor auditorium and an outdoor picture garden, which was serviced by one mechanised ‘bio box’. The tram and ferry services brought people from outside the area to the Cinema.
The theatre was renamed the Cygnet Theatre in the 1960s to associate it with the Festival of Perth’s black swan logo. Despite the name change, the original Broadway face type lettering stating "The Como Theatre" around the 'bio box' still exists. Although no longer a Festival of Perth venue, the Cygnet Cinema continues to successfully operate as a suburban cinema.
The entrance and foyer of the cinema were rearranged in 1964, with the entry doors shifted west of the original entrance, and the original entrance area was converted into part of the confectionery counter. Air conditioning was installed in the cinema in October 1968 to combat the threat of television, but patronage continued to drop and the picture garden was demolished within a year. In 1981 alterations were made to the auditorium, with the seats in the front stalls removed and the other seating realigned.
Architectural character.
The theatre reflects the architectural style popular in the inter-war period, using nautical motifs such as wavy lines, smooth flat curves and tubular handrails, with an architectural emphasis on both the horizontal and vertical aspects of the building.
The Cygnet Cinema is an example of the Inter-War Functionalist style. Characteristics of this style are the asymmetrical massing of smooth geometric elements, and emphasis on exterior form reflecting internal function. The prominent central tower housed the ‘bio box’, which serviced both the indoor auditorium and the outdoor picture garden. Film canisters were hauled up to the ‘bio box’ balcony from the street. The tower extends out in a fashionable streamlined curve and features a cantilevered balcony with steel railings, resembling the form of a modern ocean liner. The ‘liner’ theme is reinforced by the three ‘port hole’ windows on the exterior of the building. The stylistic influence of Le Corbusier, a functional Modernist architect, is evident in these forms and detail.
In the summer of 2013, American street artist Nils Westergard painted a portrait of Alfred Hitchcock on the western facing exterior wall of the building.
Current uses.
In August 2004, the Heritage Council of Western Australia provided a $4,500 grant to prepare a conservation plan for the Cinema. The theatre is currently leased by independent operators from the owner, Colin Stiles, the son of the original owner, James Stiles.
Heritage value.
The Cygnet Theatre was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 27 October 1998 and was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 2 May 1988. The building is also included on the City of South Perth's Municipal Inventory and was permanently listed on the State Register of Heritage Places on 30 June 1995.

Dopplr

Dopplr was a free social networking service, launched in 2007, that allowed users to create itineraries of their travel plans and spot correlations with their contacts' travel plans in order to arrange meetings at any point on their journey. Additional features included allowing the user to calculate the carbon footprint their journeys have produced. The site was named after Christian Doppler, discoverer of the Doppler effect. The company was based in the Old Street area of London.
Shutdown.
On September 28, 2009 Dopplr announced that they had been acquired by Nokia. Within a year many were questioning the future of the site, noting that Dopplr's blog had not been updated since two days after the acquisition and its unique monthly users had plummeted from 39,000 to 29,000. In a statement issued in September 2010 a Nokia spokesperson reported "we have decided to bring it into a maintenance mode … but will not develop it further at this stage."

Sécurité Civile

Operating for the French Ministry of the Interior, the "Direction de la Défense de la Sécurité Civile" (Department of Civil Defence and Emergency Preparedness) is a French Government civil defence agency, employing some 2,500 civilian and military personnel over 60 sites. Known as the "Protection Civile" until 1976, the "Sécurité Civile" is split into several branches.
The "Sous-Direction des Sapeur-pompiers" are the French firefighters.
The "Sous-Direction des opérations de Secours et de la coopération civilo-militaire" (Rescue operation and civil-military cooperation branch) is involved in bomb disposal, coast guard, mountain rescue, air ambulance and aerial firefighting duties.
Aircraft.
"Sécurité Civile" aircraft operate for the Rescue operation and civil-military cooperation branch under the "Groupement des Moyens Aériens Sécurité Civile" (Aerial Group). Aircraft carry the title SECURITE CIVILE on the fuselage sides, together with the international civil defence symbol. The aircraft are divided into the "Groupement des Helicopteres de la Securite Civile" (Helicopter Group) and the "Groupement des Avions Bombardiers d'Eau" (Water Bomber Group).
Helicopter Group.
The "Sécurité Civile" helicopter group has 22 helicopter bases in mainland France and its overseas territories. It has a fleet of 40 helicopters and employs 230 pilots and flight engineers and 50 ground engineers. Over its 50 years of activity, the helicopter group has an impressive track record, with 480,000 flight hours, 250,000 rescue missions and 225,000 people rescued. Helicopter group aircraft use the callsign "DRAGON", followed by the number of the "département" in which their base is located.
Six "Aerospatiale Alouette" III SA316B are still in operation, based at Alpe d'huez, Chamonix, Nîmes and Paris.
Four Eurocopter "Écureuil" AS-350 are operated out of Cannes, Nîmes and Marseille.
"Sécurité Civile" currently operates 35 EC-145 helicopters that were delivered between 2002 and 2005. The fleet has accumulated over 100,000 flight hours. The EC-145 fleet is used for search and rescue, fire fighting, emergency medical services (EMS), surveillance and law enforcement. EC-145s are deployed on 22 "Sécurité Civile" bases in France and the French Overseas Territories. An order has been placed for a further five helicopters, to be delivered from January 2009. This will enable the phasing out of the six remaining "Alouette" III helicopters. The EC 145 carries out an average 10,000 rescue missions each year, representing over 13,300 flight hours.
Bases.
Helicopter group bases of operation are located at:.
The "Echelon Central" (command centre), and helicopter maintenance base is located in Nîmes.
Helicopters are detached to several other bases seasonally. In summer, aircraft are detached to Courchevel, Alpes d'Huez, Gavarnie, Lacanau, and Chamonix. In winter, aircraft are detached to Chamonix and Alpes d'Huez.
Water Bomber Group.
12 Bombardier CL-415s are currently operated by the "Sécurité Civile", each able to drop 5,800 L (1,530 US gal). France was the first nation to commit to the CL-415 "Superscoop" in 1992, so that it could phase out its CL-215s.
Two pre-owned Bombardier Dash 8 Q400s, acquired from Scandinavian Airlines System, were modified by Cascade Aerospace of Abbotsford, British Columbia, for the "Sécurité Civile" to act as fire-fighting water bombers in fire season and as transport aircraft off season. This aircraft is designated the Q400-MR (Multi Role). The aircraft can be reconfigured into the passenger, cargo or aerial fire control role in under three hours and can drop 10,000 L (2,640 US gal) in the tanker role.
Nine Conair Turbo Firecats are in operation. The Turbo Firecat is a turboprop conversion of the Grumman S-2 Tracker, carried out by Conair (now Cascade Aerospace), Canada. The first delivery to the "Sécurité Civile" was in August 1988.
Bases.
All fixed-wing aircraft are based at Marseille Provence Airport.
Bomb Disposal.
307 "Sécurité Civile" bomb disposal experts are based at 20 bomb disposal units, including 2 overseas units (Guadeloupe and French Guiana). They are responsible for the detection, removal, disposal or destruction of suspicious objects. They also provide assistance during official travel or large demonstrations and de-arm and destroy unexploded ammunition still present from the two world wars.
In 2004,  tonnes (440 tons) of munitions was disposed of, whilst 43 bomb disposal experts were deployed on the 60th anniversary of the Normandy landings, 17 on the 60th anniversary of the landing in Provence and 16 on the Pope's visit to Lourdes.

ING Cup (football)

ING Cup is a pre-Olympics football tournament held at Hong Kong Stadium, Hong Kong from 30 July to 2 August 2008. Netherlands,
Cameroon, U.S.A and Ivory Coast competed for the ING Cup as part of their teams' final preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
Background.
The ING Cup was hosted by the Hong Kong Football Association and organised by the Asian Football Confederation's (AFC) marketing partner World Sport Group (WSG).
Format.
Since Netherlands and U.S.A are in the same group in the Olympic football tournament, they will not face each other in the ING Cup. Therefore the winner of the ING Cup will be determined by the number of points gained from the matches played.
The point system was different from the regular football scoring system. A win earned 3 points, but a point was awarded for every goal scored. A draw still earned one point, and a loss did not gain or lose points.
Schedule.

Battle of Bairoko

The Battle of Bairoko was a battle between American and Imperial Japanese Army and Navy forces on 20 July 1943 during the New Georgia Campaign in the Solomon Islands during the Pacific War. In the battle, U.S. Marine Raiders—supported by two U.S. Army infantry battalions—attacked a Japanese garrison guarding the port of Bairoko on the Dragons Peninsula on New Georgia. The day-long assault on well-prepared Japanese defensive positions by the Americans was unsuccessful.
After calling-off the assault, the Americans withdrew to nearby Enogai. The American forces remained in the Enogai area until the end of the New Georgia Campaign. The Japanese used Bairoko to resupply and reinforce their troops who were guarding an airfield at Munda Point on New Georgia. After the U.S. and its allies successfully captured the airfield, the Japanese evacuated New Georgia and abandoned Bairoko on 24 August.

Anlamani

Anlamani was a king of Nubia or Kush who ruled from 620 BC and died around 600 BC.
Anlamani used titles based on those of the Egyptian Pharaohs.<br>
Horus name: Kanakht Khaemmaat ("Strong Bull appears in Equity") <br>
Nebty Name: Seankhibutawy ("Nourisher of the Two Lands") <br>
Golden Horus Name: Her(y)hormaat ("Who is satisfied with equity")<br>
Prenomen: Ankhkare ("Re is one whose ka lives") <br>
Nomen: Anlamani
Under his reign, Kush experienced a revival in its power. Anlamani was the son of Senkamanisken, his predecessor, and the elder brother of Aspelta, his successor.
Reign.
Anlamani is particularly well known from a stela discovered in a temple at Kawa. The stela records his mother Nasalsa's visit to Kawa to watch his official coronation as king. It also notes his decision to make four of his sisters as "sistrum-players" in the National temple of Amun at Gebel Barkal and reports the king's campaign against certain nomadic tribes who threatened Kawa.
Two granite statues of this king have been found in Gebel Barkal while a block from Meroë bearing his name is known. One of the statues is today located in the National Museum of Khartoum, Sudan) while the other (a 12 foot high statue) is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Anlamani was buried in pyramid Nu. 6 in Nuri. In his tomb stood a large chamber, decorated with religious texts, and his sarcophagus.
Sometime, in the reign of his brother Aspelta, the Egyptian king Psamtik II launched a campaign against Kush which resulted in the sack of his kingdom's capital in 592 BC.

<doc id="18654080" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18654080" title="Typhoon Kalmaegi (2008)">
Typhoon Kalmaegi (2008)

Typhoon Kalmaegi (international designation: 0807, JTWC designation: 08W, PAGASA name: Helen) was the seventh named storm and the fifth typhoon that was recognised by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also recognised it as the eighth tropical depression, the seventh tropical storm and the sixth typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season.
Kalmaegi formed as a tropical depression on 13 July when it was located to the east of the Philippines. It was named Kalmaegi by RSMC Tokyo on 15 July; the storm reached its peak winds of on 17 July. Shortly afterwards it made a direct landfall on Taiwan and then moved into China's Fujan province the next day it emerged into the Taiwan Strait and raced towards North Korea where it became fully extratropical and the last advisories were released.
Meteorological history.
Early on July 13, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), began to issue full advisories on a tropical depression, which was located to the east of the Philippines. Later that day PAGASA allocated the name Helen to the depression, followed the next day by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designating the number 08W. Early on July 15, both the JTWC, and the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, with RSMC Tokyo assigning the name "Kalmaegi" to the storm, which was submitted by North Korea and is Korean for seagull. Early on the 17th, Kalmaegi began rapidly intensifying; JMA was the first agency to upgrade it into a typhoon. JTWC followed a few hours later. Finally, PAGASA upgraded Kalmaegi (Helen) into a typhoon on later that day.
Typhoon Kalmaegi, which was downgraded to tropical storm status by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau while still east of the country, made landfall at Ilan County in northeast Taiwan in the evening of July 17 at 19:40 local time (13:40 UTC) and emerged into the Taiwan Strait at 7:20 in the morning local time (01:20 UTC) on July 18. From Taiwan, the typhoon, now downgraded to a tropical storm, turned toward southeast China. In Xiapu County of Fujian Province, the tropical storm made landfall at 17:50 local time (0950 UTC), with winds of about 90 miles per hour. Early on July 19, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Kalmaegi and downgraded it to a tropical depression. However, the JMA continued to issue advisories and maintained Kalmaegi as a tropical storm as it moved to the Yellow Sea. Late the next day, the JMA downgraded Kalmaegi to a low (extratropical cyclone) as it moved inland over North Korea.
Preparations.
Philippines.
PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signals for provinces across Northern Luzon from July 14 till the 17th. Initially, PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 1 over Cagayan, Isabela, Batanes Group of Islands and Calayan Group of Islands. But as the storm tracked nearer to Northern Luzon, more and more are issued Signals 1, 2 and 3. By the afternoon of the 16th Philippine Time, only Batanes was left under Signal Number one. PAGASA issued their last advisory on Helen (Kalmaegi) on 2100 UTC 17 July (5 a.m. 18 July PST).
Taiwan.
Several flights in and out of Taiwan were either delayed or cancelled due to the typhoon. All evening classes for the day the storm made landfall were closed however, all classes were scheduled to resume the next day.
Mainland China.
Officials in Fujian Province and Zhejiang Province ordered about 61,000 ships to return to port and evacuated an estimated 360,000 people from low-lying areas.
Impact.
Philippines.
In the Philippines, it passed over Northern Luzon (mostly affecting Ilocos and Cagayan Valley), where it killed two people and injured another. The first fatality occurred after a man drove off the edge of a cliff due to poor visibility. The second was linked to a snake bite following the storm. In all, Kalmaegi affected at least 31,129 people throughout 146 barangays in three provinces. Property damages amounted to ₱ 5.6 million. The storm also hit 82 villages (all in Northern Luzon) and caused around ₱1.3 million worth of damage to agriculture. Meanwhile, the storm intensified the southwest monsoon, thus causing torrential rains over the rest of Luzon. The resulting rains thus caused suspension of classes in parts of Metro Manila.
Taiwan.
At least 19 lost their lives due to the storm and six were reported as missing. Tainan County (now part of Tainan City) in southern Taiwan reported more than 1100 mm of rainfall in some mountain regions. An estimated 600 mm (23.6 in) of rain fell within seven hours, causing several drainage systems to overflow. Local media reported that an estimate 115,000 people in Taiwan, primarily in Tainan, Nantou County, and Taichung County (now part of Taichung City) lost power during the storm. The storm caused NT$ 300 million ($15.1 million USD) worth of damage, and destroyed about 5,100 hectares of orchards and crops. Agricultural losses amounted to $300 million (USD).
Mainland China.
In Xiapu County of Fujian Province and in neighboring Zhejiang Province, 360,000 residents left coastal and low-lying homes to escape the storm. Schools and many businesses remained closed, and the storm was expected to travel northwest.
Republic of Korea.
The remnants of Kalmaegi produced heavy rains over the Korean Peninsula, peaking at 237.5 mm (9.3 in) in Seoul. Rainfall rates were recorded up to 52.5 mm (2 in) per hour at times, caused water to overflow at several of the major dams along the Han, Nakdong, and Geum Rivers. One dam, the Paldang-Dam had to discharge water at a rate of 4,817 m3 (170,110 ft3) per second. Eight levees were breached, with a total length of 105 m (344 ft), due to rising rivers, flooding 93 homes and 87.58 hectares (216.4 acres) of farmland. Rains also caused landslide which covered an area of 0.6 hectares (1.4 acres) and washed out a small bridge. Four people were killed, another was listed as missing, and a total of 271 were affected by the storm.
Japan.
Yonaguni, lying at the end of the Ryukyu Islands near Taiwan, experienced strong winds gusting up to 98 km/h (60 mph).
Russia.
After moving through the Sea of Japan, the remnants of Kalmaegi brought significant rainfall and strong winds to parts of eastern Russia. Winds were reported to be gusting up to 85 km/h (50 mph) in Primorsky Krai and southern Khabarovsk Krai. Several rivers in Primorsky were reportedly near flood stage as the storm passed through. Offshore, Several ships were stranded during the storm and sent out distress signals.
Aftermath.
Philippines.
Relief goods, worth ₱138,744 were sent to affected areas within region one.
Taiwan.
Government officials in Taiwan enacted a large rescue operation involving over 60,000 civilian and government rescue workers. Following the severe flooding in Taiwan, officials in Mainland China were willing to send fresh vegetables whenever needed.
Naming.
The name Kalmaegi was submitted to the World Meteorological Organisation's Typhoon Committee by North Korea and was one of the original names submitted for use from January 1, 2000. The name Kalmaegi is Korean for a seagull which is a type of bird which lives by the sea.

Andrew McNair is best known for being the custodian who served the Continental Congress. A member of the Masonic Order, he served as official ringer of the Liberty Bell from 1759 to 1776, and he likely rang it to announce independence, on July 8, 1776 (the announcement was delayed four days to allow the Declaration to be printed). His services were terminated September 15, 1776, for unknown reasons.
The records of the American Philosophical Society record that on March 22, 1768, the Society contracted McNair to make the fires, light and extinguish candles, and keep its meeting room clean, for four shillings a night.
McNair was played in the play and movie "1776" by William Duell.
In his poem, "The Liberty Bell," Charles Brockden Brown describes McNair, not by name as follows:
<poem>
Far aloft in that high steeple,
He was weary of the tyrant

In 2006, McNair's descendant, Edward McNair, offered a ring on eBay made from metal Andrew McNair had supposedly broken from the Liberty Bell (with a "buy it now" price of $75,000). After the chief caretaker of the Bell opined that Andrew McNair could not have done so, the ring was withdrawn from sale.

Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park

Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is an industrial symbiosis network located in Kalundborg, Denmark, in which companies in the region collaborate to use each other's by-products and otherwise share resources. The park at Kalundborg is the first full realization of industrial symbiosis. The collaboration and its environmental implications arose unintentionally through market forces, as opposed to through government planning, making it a model for private planning of eco-industrial parks. At the center of the exchange network is the Asnæs Power Station, a 1500MW coal-fired power plant, which has material and energy links with the community and several other companies. Surplus heat from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby fish farm, whose sludge is then sold as a fertilizer. Steam from the power plant is sold to Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical and enzyme manufacturer, in addition to Statoil power plant. This reuse of heat reduces the amount thermal pollution discharged to a nearby fjord. Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's sulfur dioxide scrubber contains gypsum, which is sold to a wallboard manufacturer. Almost all of the manufacturer's gypsum needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of open-pit mining needed. Furthermore, fly ash and clinker from the power plant is used for road building and cement production. These exchanges of waste, water and materials have greatly increased environmental and economic efficiency, as well as created other less tangible benefits for these actors, including sharing of personnel, equipment, and information.
History.
The Kalundborg Industrial Park was not originally planned for industrial symbiosis. Its current state of waste heat and materials sharing developed over a period of 20 years. Early sharing at Kalundborg tended to involve the sale of waste products without significant pretreatment. Each further link in the system was negotiated as an independent business deal, and was established only if it was expected to be economically beneficial.
The park began in 1959 with the start up of the Asnæs Power Station. The first episode of sharing between two entities was in 1972 when Gyproc, a plaster-board manufacturing plant, established a pipleine to supply gas from Tidewater Oil Company. In 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completed a district heating distribution network within the city of Kalundborg, which utilized waste heat from the power plant.
Since then, the facilities in Kalundborg have been expanding, and have been sharing a variety of materials and waste products, some for the purpose of industrial symbiosis and some out of necessity, for example, freshwater scarcity in the area has led to water reuse schemes. In particular, 700,000 cubic meters per year of cooling water is piped from Statoil to Asnaes per year.
A timeline of the creation of the industrial park:
The Symbiosis.
The relationships among the firms comprising the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park form an industrial symbiosis. Generally speaking, the actors involved in the symbiosis at Kalundborg exchange material wastes, energy, water, and information. The Kalundborg network involves a number of actors, including a power station, two big energy firms, a plaster board company, and a soil remediation company. Other actors include farmers, recycling facilities, and fish factories that use some of the material flows. Kalundborg Municipality plays an active role. Additionally, other actors, such as Novoren, a recycling and urban land field firm, are formally part of the network but do not contribute
tangibly in the exchange.
Partners.
The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park today includes nine private and public enterprises, some of which are some of the largest enterprises in Denmark. The enterprises are:
Material Exchanges.
There are currently over thirty exchanges of materials among the actors of Kalundborg. The Asnaes Power Station is at the heart of the network. The power company gives its steam residuals to the Statoil Refinery, meeting 40% of its steam requirements, in exchange for waste gas from the refinery. The power plant creates electricity and steam from this gas. These products are sent to a fish farm, Novo Nordisk, which receives all of its required steam from Asnaes, and a heating system that supplies 3500 homes. These homeowners pay for the underground piping that supplies their heat, but receive the heat reliably and at a low price. Fly ash from Asnaes is sent to a cement company, and gypsum from its desulfurization process is sent to Gyproc for use in gypsum board. Two-thirds of Gyproc's gypsum needs are met by Asnaes. Statoil Refinery removes sulfur from its natural gas and sells it to a sulfuric acid manufacturer, Kemira. The fish farm sells sludge from its ponds as fertilizer to nearby farms, and Novo Nordisk gives away its own sludge, of which it produces 3,000 cubic meters per day.
Water reuse schemes have also been developed within Kalundborg. Statoil pipes 700,000 cubic meters of cooling water per year to Asnaes, which purifies it and uses it as "boiler feed-water." Asnaes also uses approximately 200,000 cubic meters of Statoil's treated wastewater per year for cleaning.
Savings and Environmental Impacts.
Since its start over 25 years ago, Kalundborg has been operating successfully as an eco-industrial park. One of the main goals of industrial symbiosis is to make goods and services that use the least-cost combination of inputs. These relationships were formed on an economic and environmental basis. As mentioned above, there are over thirty exchanges occurring in Kalundborg. While Kalundborg does operate using trades between various firms in the vicinity, it itself is not self-sufficient or contained to the industrial park. There are many trades that occur with companies outside of this park region.
All of these exchanges have contributed to water savings, and savings in fuel and input chemicals. Wastes were also avoided through these interchanges. For example, in 1997, Asnaes (the power station) saved 30,000 tons of coal (~2% of throughput) by using Statoil (large oil refinery) fuel gas. And 200,000 tons of fly ash and clinker were avoided from Asnaes landfill. These resources savings and waste avoidances, documented before 1997, are illustrated in the tables to the right.
A study in 2002 showed that these exchanges also contributed to more than 95% of the total water supply to the power plant. This is up from 70% in 1990. So, the system is becoming more comprehensive in its ability to save groundwater, however, there is still room for improvement. Out of the 1.2 million m3 of wastewater discharged from Statoil (the refinery), only 9000 m3 were reused at the power plant.
More recent numbers show a vast improvement, when comparing to the numbers from 1997, in resource savings. Data from around 2004 show annual savings of 2.9 million cubic meters of ground water, and 1 million cubic meters of surface water. Gypsum savings are estimated around 170,000 tons, and sulfur dioxide waste avoidance is estimated around 53 Tn. These numbers are mostly estimations. Aspects of the eco-industrial park have changed, and there are many levels to consider when doing these calculations. All together though, these interchanges have shown annual savings of up to $15 million (US), with investments around $78.5 million (US). The total accumulated savings is estimated around $310 million (US).
As a Model.
Kalundborg was the first example of separate industries grouping together to gain competitive advantage by material exchange, energy exchange, information exchange, and/or product exchange. The very term, Industrial Symbiosis (IS) was first defined by a station manager in Kalundborg as "a cooperation between different industries by which the presence of each…increases the viability of the others, and by which the demans of society for resource savings and environmental protection are considered" .
Kalundborg's success helped generate interest in industrial symbiosis. Developed nations such as the United States began to formulate incentives for corporations to implement materials exchange with other corporations. Industrial and political circles began to look into implementation of eco-industrial parks (EIPs). Specifically, the United States worked to put into service several planned EIPs. The U.S President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 proposed fifteen eco-industrial parks to pursue the idea of industrial symbiosis. These parks were created by grouping diverse stakeholders with common material flows together, with added governmental incentives to encourage materials exchange. The goal of these planned EIPs was to test if the idustrial symbiosis that worked so well in Kalundborg could be replicated. The Council on Sustainable Development also defined 5 major characteristics of a successful EIP to help guide EIP development. These characteristics include: (1) some form of material exchange between multiple separate entities, (2) industries within close proximity to each other, (3) cooperation between plant management of the different corporations, (4) an existing infrastructure for material sharing that does not require much retooling, and (5) "anchor" tenants (large corporation with resources to support early implementation. Devens Regional Enterprise Zone is a good example of a successful EIP in the United States.
Kalundborg became an attractive topic in academia as well because of the obvious sustainability advantages of industrial symbiosis. Research conducted on planning and implementation of eco-industrial parks revealed interesting results. Experts argued over the idea of "planned parks" versus "self organized parks". Research showed systematic failure of forced or planned EIPs. Most successful EIPs originate from industrial symbiosis that occurs naturally during industry life, much like the Kalundborg case. This conclusion served to deflate the momentum that the success of Kalundborg generated. Organizations began to recognize the difficulties associated with forcing eco-industrial parks to coalesce and abandoned the idea.

Yagura (tombs)

"Yagura" can be found either isolated, as in the case of the "Harakiri Yagura", or in clusters of almost 200 caves. Groups of yagura are labeled with the suffix . The most conveniently seen "yagura" for most tourists are those at Jufuku-ji, near Kamakura station. Its cemetery has many yagura, including those with the cenotaphs of Hōjō Masako and Minamoto no Sanetomo.
True "yagura" can be found also in the Miura Peninsula, in the Izu Peninsula, and as far away as Awa Province (Chiba).
History.
There is a lack of solid documentary or archeological evidence regarding exactly when or why the "yagura" system was adopted. It is generally believed that tombs were dug into the soft rock of the hills around the city because of lack of space in the valley below. The only way to date a "yagura" is through the dates carved on a "gorintō" or stele that it may contain. On this basis, the oldest was found near the Asahina Pass and dated to between 1260 and 1270. 
It was previously thought that an ambiguously titled law that forbade cemeteries in towns (the ) referred to Kamakura, and therefore was the origin of the custom. It is now believed that the law was promulgated for the city of Fuchu, in Bungo Province of Kyushu, by the Ōtomo clan. However, some historians think the Ōtomo must have used a Kamakura shogunate law as a model. The custom continued after the demise of the shogunate and well into the Ashikaga period, until the middle of the 15th century, after which it declined. The "yagura" of the time give some indication of the decline of the custom: some have been converted to storehouses, others served as a convenient grave for inhumation, and thus were filled.
Structure of a "yagura".
In many cases the mouth of the "sendō" was sealed by a wooden door (), the remains of which can sometimes still be seen. In some cases, cremated bones were interred in an opening in the floor, but in other tombs there is instead urn. In either case, "yagura" floors are part of the bedrock, so are not suitable for burials. Fragments of cremated bone can occasionally be found. 
Inside a yagura, the grave is often marked by a stone "gorintō", "hōkyōintō" (Buddhist tower), or other stone monument. These are normally later additions. Other Buddhist imagery, such as statues of "Jizō" are commonly found, as in most Japanese cemeteries. Red painted rafters are visible on the ceiling of the .
Etymology and written form.
As with many other aspects of "yagura" and their history, the etymology of the name is unclear. According to one hypothesis, the name derives from , or watchtower, but it seems more likely that it is just a local corruption of , that is, a stone storehouse. 
The word "yagura" over the centuries has been written in several ways, among them . The term is now usually written only in "hiragana".

Dice (Finley Quaye song)

"Dice" is a single released by Finley Quaye. It was written with Beth Orton and recorded by William Orbit.
Composition.
The segment of the song sang by Beth Orton is sampled from "Roll The Dice", a song which originally appeared on her 1993 debut album Superpinkymandy. The album was also produced by her then-boyfriend William Orbit.
Single use.
The single was used in the American Fox network TV series "The OC" in episode 14 of season one, entitled "The Countdown". The song was a minor hit, helped in part by its inclusion on OC's the Season 1 sound track called "" (track 10). The TV series "Chuck" used the same song in episode 6 of season one ("Chuck vs. the Sandworm.") as a parallel to "The OC" episode.
The song was also featured in episode 14 of season 3 ("Since you've been gone") in the TV Series "Everwood."
It can also be found on the Ministry of Sound's Chilled 1991 - 2008.
It has also been used by BBC Scotland in their TV trailer for the TV series called 'Hebrides" 2013

Rajah (dog)

Rajah the German Shepherd Dog (billed as "Methven's Wonder Dog") was a working and performance dog in New Zealand during the 1930s. Rajah is credited with being the first police dog in New Zealand and was nominated as a replacement for Rin Tin Tin after his death. Rajah amassed fame throughout the country for his acting performances and locating work performed with the New Zealand Police, in multiple locations throughout New Zealand.
History.
Rajah was owned by Constable John Robertson, who was the only serving police officer in the town of Methven at the time. Rajah assisted Robertson in his duties, and while he was not officially designated the position, Rajah was the first police dog in New Zealand.
Rajah was trained by Robertson and his son using a search-and-find method. This made the dog very perceptive at finding concealed objects and assisted the dog greatly in its future work.
Working life.
Rajah's work mostly consisted of finding weapons and other notable items, and he was also infrequently used to locate remains. During his time in service, Rajah only failed once in finding his objective – the body of a woman believed by police to have been the victim of foul play and dumped along the railway line that was still under construction at the time. However, it was revealed a few years later that the body he was looking for had been embedded inside a concrete pillar.
When Rin Tin Tin died in 1932, a representative from the now defunct Fox Film Corporation proposed that Rajah be used as his replacement. The family ultimately declined the offer, citing that it was too big a move and instead chose to put Rajah to work doing performances around New Zealand, including in Christchurch and Timaru. Rajah was also able to continue working as a police dog.
Memorial.
In 2007, the Methven city council proposed that a monument in Rajah's honour be erected in front of the Methven Police station. The proposal was met with positive community response and substantial donations have already made.

Kamavardani

Kamavardani (pronounced kāmavardani) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 51st "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is also referred by the name "Pantuvarāḷi", although purists prefer to designate it as Kamavardani.
This rāgam is very popular with musicians who typically sing it in the beginning of a concert. It is called Kāshirāmakriya in the Muthuswami Dikshitar school. The Hindustani music equivalent of "Kamavardhini" is the "Poorvi thaat".
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 3rd rāgam in the 9th "chakra Brahma". The mnemonic name is "Brahma-Go". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra gu mi pa dha nu". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
It is a "sampoorna" rāgam – a rāgam that has all seven "swaras" (notes). This rāgam differs from the 15th "melakarta" rāgam "Mayamalavagowla", which is the rāgam taught to a beginner in Carnatic music, only by the "madhyamam". "Kamavardani" is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Mayamalavagowla".
"Janya" rāgams.
It has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with it.
Popular compositions.
"Shambo Mahadeva Shankara Girija Ramana", "Saramegani", "Aparama bhakthi", "Sundara daradeham" and "Shiva Shiva Shiva ena radha" by the maestro Thyagaraja are popular compositions sung in concerts. "Enna ganu rama" by Bhadrachala Ramadas is another well-known composition in this rāgam. 
"Sarasaksha Paripalaya maamayi" and "Saroruhaasana" by Swati Tirunal are set to this rāgam.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Kamavardani's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields "Kanakangi" (the 1st "melakarta"). "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

27th Connecticut Infantry Regiment

The 27th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment recruited in New Haven, Connecticut, for service in the American Civil War.
Organization.
The 27th Connecticut was raised in the late summer of 1862 in response to President Abraham Lincoln's nationwide call for volunteers to put down the rebellion. The regiment would serve for a nine-month enlistment, unlike the usual three-year enlistments, inducing many older, married men to answer the call. This is evident by the fact that the average age of the 27th Connecticut was 27 years, about six years older than the average age of Union soldiers in general.
The 27th Connecticut departed for Washington, D.C., on October 22 and was attached to the Military District of Washington until November 7, 1862. It was then attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, 2nd Army Corps, Army of the Potomac, and it advanced to Falmouth, Virginia.
War history.
In its nine months of service, the 27th fought in the three largest campaigns in the eastern theatre of the war. First at the Battle of Fredericksburg, on December 13, 1862, during which they launched an attack up Marye's Heights under their brigade commander Col. Samuel K. Zook. 
Their second taste of combat was the Battle of Chancellorsville, on May 1, 2 and 3, 1863. On May 3, eight out of 10 companies making up the 27th were captured after fighting a fierce delaying action holding back Confederate forces so the Union Army could reorganize itself and hold of the confederates. 
Finally, the 27th Connecticut embarked on their last campaign of their nine-month service which culminated with the campaign and Battle of Gettysburg, on July 1, 2 and 3, 1863. Here, in the late afternoon of July 2, the 27th entered the battle with a total of 3 companies only 160 men out of the original 829 who had joined just nine months earlier. They occupied the portion of the union line known as "The Wheatfield," where the regiment successfully held back the rebels. By the end of the battle, 10 men were dead, 23 wounded, and 4 were missing. Among the regiment's casualties was Regimental Commander Lt. Col. Henry C. Merwin, who was struck by a bullet. After his death, Maj. James H. Colburn took command of the regiment for the rest of its service.
On July 18, 1863, what remained of the 27th was released from the Army of the Potomac and sent back to New Haven to be discharged. On the way home to Connecticut, they were reunited with 279 men who were captured at Chancellorsville, and had been paroled by the Confederates in a prisoner exchange.
Casualties.
In its nine months of service, the Regiment lost 533 men who were killed, wounded, captured, and died of disease out of 829 enrolled.

Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing

Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing or ECISTM (a trademark of Applied BioPhysics Inc.) refers to a non-invasive biophysical approach to monitor living animal cells "in vitro", i.e. within a well-defined laboratory environment.
In ECIS the cells are grown on the surface of small and planar gold-film electrodes, which are deposited on the bottom of a cell culture dish (petri dish). The AC impedance of the cell-covered electrode is then measured at one or several frequencies as a function of time. Due to the insulating properties of their membranes the cells behave like dielectric particles so that the impedance increases with increasing coverage of the electrode until a confluent (i.e. continuous) layer of cells is established. In confluent cell layers the measured impedance is mainly determined by the three-dimensional shape of the cells. If cell shape changes occur, the current pathways through and around the cell bodies change as well, leading to a corresponding increase or decrease of impedance. Thus, by recording time-resolved impedance measurements, cell shape changes can be followed in real time with sub-microscopic resolution and can be used for bioanalytic purposes.
As the shape of animal cells responds very sensitively to alterations in metabolism as well as chemical, biological or physical stimuli, the ECIS technique is applied in various experimental settings in cell biological research laboratories. It can be used as a sensor in cytotoxicity studies, drug development or as a non-invasive means to follow cell adhesion to "in vitro" surfaces. Equipments based on the ECIS technique are also dedicated to monitor the chemokinetic activity of adherent cells spread on the electrode surface (micromotion) as well as their chemotactic activities in ECIS-based wound healing assays.

Moesian dialects

The Moesian dialects are a group of closely related dialects of the Bulgarian language, part of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. The Moesian dialects are spoken in northeastern Bulgaria and in the regions of Karnobat, Aytos, Burgas and Yambol in southern Bulgaria. However, due to the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, nowadays, there are very few areas where only Moesian is spoken. In most areas, and especially in southern Bulgaria and Dobruja, Moesian speakers are mixed with speakers speaking Balkan dialects. As a result of this and also due to the influence of the literary language, most features of the Moesian dialects have given way to features typical for the Balkan dialects.

Personal life.
He was born in Dubuque, Iowa in 1948. At age 14, he dropped out of high school and joined a traveling carnival. He later joined a gang called the Manor Boys. He attempted to join the Marines but was rejected for hearing problems. Bartmann became an alcoholic by age 17, and one night fell down a flight of stairs while drunk. He became paralyzed and was told that he would never walk again. Against his doctor's wishes, Bartmann embarked on a nightly regimen of physical activity until he eventually regained the use of his legs.
For several years Bartmann worked at the Dubuque Packing Company, a large local slaughterhouse. While there, Bartmann organized a wildcat strike to force the company to give benefits to part-time workers. The strike was successful. Around this time, Bartmann ran into a high school principal who earlier had expelled him from school. The principal challenged Bartmann to get his GED certificate, which he did. Bartmann later earned a BS from Loras College and a JD from Drake University.
After passing the Iowa Bar Exam, Bartmann immediately went into private practice, specializing in consumer law. He also invested in real estate. Bartmann moved to Muskogee, OK to devote full-time to real estate investing. Bartmann was later asked by a local bank to take over a struggling oil equipment company in Oklahoma. He turned around the company and grew it substantially. It folded in 1985 due to falling oil prices, with Bartmann one million dollars in debt due to personally guaranteeing some of the corporate obligations.
In October 2013, "Bouncing Back" the autobiography of Bill Bartmann's life was published (Brown Books), detailing Mr. Bartmann unlikely life story from homelessness and abject poverty to Nobel Peace prize nominee.
Commercial Financial Services.
Hounded by debt collectors, Bartmann looked for other opportunities. He saw an ad in the newspaper about buying defaulted loans from the federal government. He bought a portfolio of loans, financed by the bank he was $1 million in debt to. Bartmann succeeded in collecting enough money from that first portfolio to recoup the cost of the portfolio, plus make a partial repayment on his bank debt. That led to more purchases of loan portfolios that allowed Bartmann to repay the entire $1 million obligation. Bartmann created a company that would buy out debts and then attempt to collect from debtors. The strategy was successful, producing net margins as high as 48%.
By 1997, Bartmann was listed in Forbes magazine as one of the 400 richest people in America. Inc. magazine estimated Bartmann's net worth to be in the range of $2.4 to $3.5 billion. Goldman Sachs offered to buy a 20% stake in the company and Norwest Bank offered to acquire, but Bartmann refused both offers.
As the company grew, Bartmann gained a reputation for doing the unexpected. He challenged his staff that if they beat their performance goals, he would take them all to Las Vegas. They exceeded the target and Bartmann flew the entire company to Las Vegas. Bartmann arrived and wrestled Hulk Hogan at the Thomas & Mack Center in Vegas." On another occasion, Bartmann leased 27 Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets to fly thousands of employees to Disney World for the weekend. CFS offered free on-site daycare that grew to 500 children, as well as free full health care and a 250% company match in its 401(k) program. BusinessWeek magazine called CFS "One of the top 10 family-oriented businesses in America" and Working Mother Magazine named it "One of the top 100 best companies for working mothers."
In 1998 the Harvard Business School published a case study on the methods Commercial Financial Services used to securitize non-performing debt. The Smithsonian Institute's Museum of American History awarded CFS its Computer World award for technological innovations.
Also in 1998, an investigation began after an anonymous letter raised questions about the propriety of certain transactions at the company by a rogue employee. Throughout the ensuing investigation, Bartmann maintained his innocence. Jay Jones, a shareholder of the company, later confessed to the questionable transactions and admitted that Bartmann did not know about them. Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Justice persuaded a third grand jury to indict Bartmann and other senior executives.
In the trial that followed, Bartmann was found to be not guilty of all charges. One of Bartmann's co-defendants sued the government for malicious prosecution and won. Even so, the controversy meant his company could not obtain financing and Commercial Financial Services declared bankruptcy. A bankruptcy trustee liquidated the company, laying off its 3900+ employees.
In 2005, the bankruptcy trustee for Commercial Financial Services publicly declared that the company had not engaged in fraud. Bartmann was cleared of all wrongdoing.
Other Activities.
In 2002, the Governor appointed Bartmann to the board of Oklahoma Futures, a public-private partnership whose goal was to advise the governor, legislature, and judiciary on ways to promote economic development in Oklahoma. The Senate confirmed Bartmann's nomination.
In 2003 Bartmann founded Bill Bartmann Enterprises in order to offer business training and information to entrepreneurs. In 2008 he noticed that the banking bailout and TARP subsidies presented an opportunity to buy defaulted debt from troubled banks, mirroring the situation he built Commercial Financial Services on in the 1980s and 1990s. Bartmann developed a series of training programs to enable individuals to buy portfolios of defaulted credit-card debt and then taught them how to collect without using litigation or other abusive behavior.
In 2009 Bartmann published a book, "Bailout Riches", which describes the opportunity he says the bank-bailout and recession of 2008-2010 has created. The book became a #1 world-wide bestseller on Amazon, and also made it to the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and BusinessWeek bestseller lists.
In 2010 Bill Bartmann Enterprises was named to the "Inc. 500" for 2009. It's the fifth time Bartmann has made the list.
CFS2.
Bartmann re-established his former debt collection company, naming the successor entity, CFS2, in July 2010. Later that year the company leased space at the CityPlex Towers complex in south Tulsa, returning Bartmann to the location where CFS had previously operated. Bartmann is in the midst of reviewing potential sites across the country for expansion, with Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Arkansas having offered incentives. Counter-intuitively CFS2 offers a unique array of free services to those they are collecting from, including: employment assistance, credit specialists who negotiate reductions of other personal debt, resume writing, medical discounts and help accessing government assistance. An anomaly to the debt collection industry, CFS2 has pledged to never litigate in order to collect from their accounts and has encouraged others in his industry to follow his lead. This helping hand approach reduces the banks reputational risk while enabling CFS2 to collect at rates twice the industry average.
In April 2013 CFS2 became the first and only collection company to ever win The American Consumer Council's "Friend of the Consumer" award. In bestowing the award American Consumer Council CEO, Thomas Hinton, remarked "as a financial recovery company, CFS2 is offering valued services that millions of consumers desperately need as we emerge from one of the longest recessions in our nation's history." CFS2 has also won the Compass Award for Business Ethics; the Beacon Award for Community Involvement and the “Stevie” Award for Customer Service.
In October 2013 CFS2 was featured on CBS Evening news as the debt collector who thrives using the unique strategy of kindness.
Industry Reform Efforts.
In the 1990s Bartmann gained a reputation for collecting debts by avoiding strong-arm tactics. 
He is following the same consumer-advocate approach in his new company, CFS2. He says: "We’re going to go at it the same way we did before, treating people with respect and helping them out of bad situations." A Bartmann-run website, StopTheseCriminals.com, urges consumers to sign a petition that calls for drastic legislative and regulatory reforms of the debt-collection industry. Among those recommended reforms are the barring of all collection efforts on debt that is older than the statute of limitations; allowing consumers to record telephone calls from collection agencies; and requiring the licensing of both agencies and individual collectors.
Bartmann has persuaded 200 Debt Buying companies to take the “Bartmann Pledge’.  The Bartmann Pledge requires all signors to agree not to use litigation against debtors; not to charge interest on the obligation, not to attempt to contact debtors more than twice in one day, not to pursue debtors beyond the statute of limitations and not to resell delinquent loans.
Bartmann has worked with members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to reform the current federal debt-collection rules. In addition he helped to enact a recent change to the Oklahoma debt-collection rules, which the Governor of Oklahoma signed into law in June, 2011.
Bartmann authored Oklahoma Senate bill 1430 “The Bartmann Bill” which would require debt collectors to follow stringent practices designed to protect consumers. This bill passed the Senate 40-2. In 2011 Bartmann was nominated to the Consumer Advisory Board of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by the president of the American Bankers Association (ABA), Frank Keating. The nomination was seconded by six sitting state attorneys general.
In October 2012, Bartmann was invited to the West Wing of the White House to meet with the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council and Senior Policy Advisers to discuss the creation of a moratorium on debt collection litigation that would reduce the national bankruptcy rate by as much as 50% while also reducing the national unemployment rate. Bartmann has worked extensively with Attorneys General across the United States to promote debt collection reforms and has testified as an expert witness at their request at numerous proceedings.
Bartmann is a regular contributor to publications like The Huffington Post and The Christian Science Monitor. He authored Out of Control: Cases of Debt-Collection Abuse In America And What We Can Do About It, an expose´of the debt collection industry.
Bartmann created the non-profit organization, The Center for Consumer Recovery, which, in October 2013, launched the Shutdown Affected Forbearance Relief (SAFR) program to help the 400,000 federal employees furloughed by the government shutdown. The Center for Consumer Recovery contacts the creditors of these furloughed workers and persuades them to grant a forbearance of interest, principal and credit reporting until the employee is called back to work. The organization's primary charter is to assist families victimized by natural disasters and act as an advocate and intermediary by dealing with the victim’s creditors, insurers and governmental agencies.
In July 2013 Bill Bartmann was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his debt collection industry reform efforts.

Thomas Müller

Thomas Müller (; born 13 September 1989) is a German footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the German national team. Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles—as an attacking midfielder, second striker, and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, team work and stamina, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals. A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. This accomplishment earned him an international call-up, and at the end of the season he was named in Germany's squad for the 2010 World Cup, where he scored five goals in six appearances as the team finished in third place. He was named as the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. He also scored Bayern's only goal in the Champions League final in 2012, with the team eventually losing on penalties.
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10 he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000. He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007. He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching, in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season, while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches and scored 15 times to make him the league's fifth top scorer. He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies, and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV. Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well, he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.
Bayern Munich.
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve team-mate Holger Badstuber. He was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football, but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season. In the first few matches Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory. Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa. He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga player of the month and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller. After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting eleven for almost every match, only missing one match – a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended, because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013. During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter, usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04, and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career, in a 3–1 win over Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern. The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC, a match which Müller started. For the season he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches, starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists. Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Internazionale at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions. In a poll conducted by the sports magazine "kicker", he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season and was named in the Bundesliga team of the season. Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say ""Müller spielt bei mir immer"" (with me, Müller will always play). Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician", who makes players "improve every time".
2010–11 season.
Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015. As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season, and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August. He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win. Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg. Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter, but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits, being dropped to the bench, and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August. He was philosophical about this dip in form, though, and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November; He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later. These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September. As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro". Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with team-mate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen. Müller again played in every game of the season and scored 19 goals (12 in the league), but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league, and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04 and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Internazionale; Bayern had won 1–0 in the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute, to go through on the away goals rule. Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy, and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.
2011–12 season.
In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig. It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, Bayern went on to win the game 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt 04 giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal. Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award. On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0) and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt. Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory. On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg. On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the UEFA Champions League final with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich however lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently. Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.
2012–13 season.
Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012. On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena. Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win. Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern ... there almost is no better club." Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017. At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League. Giving him a total of thirteen goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe. On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against FC Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena. On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the UEFA Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score. Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal. Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete a historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga, one in the Pokal and an impressive eight in the Champions League, he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1. This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.
2013–14 season.
Müller began the 2013–14 season with a bright start scoring in 7 of Bayern's 12 pre-season games. On 5 August in Bayern's 2013–14 DFB-Pokal first round game against Schwarz-Weiß Rehden Müller scored a hat-trick as Bayern won 5–0. In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga game Müller missed a penalty for the first time. But just seconds later the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba put away. After this Müller stated "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." Bayern then faced Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal on 25 September. Müller scored twice taking his DFB-Pokal tally to five goals in just two games. Then on 28 September, Bayern faced VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. Müller scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory giving him his first goal in the 2013–14 Bundesliga. Bayern started October with a 2013–14 UEFA Champions League match against Manchester City on 2 October. Müller scored his first Champions League goal of the campaign and Bayern defeated Manchester City 3–1.
International career.
Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004. In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey. He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal, the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused German national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up, despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board; the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against Côte d'Ivoire. However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week. With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010, and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March. He made his debut in this game in the starting eleven at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.
2010 World Cup.
Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's namesake Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists. He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico. For both awards, he succeeded a German team-mate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany team-mates. Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".
Euro 2012.
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals, three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare. He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011, the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup.
Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 win away to Kazakhstan. He scored again in the 3–0 victories over Austria and Faroe Islands.
Playing style.
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder, a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder, but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the center for Bayern Munich, and on the right for Germany. He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.
Müller has been praised for his maturity, pace, technique, awareness and positioning. He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure" and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength. A consistent scorer and creator of goals, he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones. Müller describes this role as "Raumdeuter", a term that translates to "interpreter of space".
Personal life.
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits. His parents are named Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, named Simon, who is two and a half years younger. He married girlfriend Lisa, a model in December 2009, after being engaged for two years. In June 2011 he became an ambassador for "YoungWings", a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.

Postage stamps and postal history of West Ukrainian National Republic

The West Ukrainian National Republic was a short-lived republic that existed in late 1918 and early 1919 in eastern Galicia. The republic managed to issue about one hundred types of postage stamps during its brief existence, all but two of which are overprints on existing stamps of Austria or Bosnia.
The 1918-1923 stamps issues.
First stamps in November 1918.
The first were four overprints of Austria overprinted in Lviv, with a design of a lion and the inscription "Zakhidno-Ukrainska Narodna Republika" were in use for only two days there. Another four Austrian stamps were surcharged with "УКР.Н.Р" ("ukr.n.r" in Cyrillic), and a new denomination in shahs (шаг), one with 5 sh and three with 10 sh. These are rather uncommon today, with prices for collectors ranging from €80 to €800 ($100–$1000 USD), and forgeries are plentiful.
The 1919 stamps.
In March 1919, officials in Stanislaviv surcharged sixteen values of 1916 Austrian stamps with "ПОШТА// УКР.Н.РЕП." ("POSHTA UKR.N.REP.") and denominations ranging from three shahs up to ten hryvnia. The same surcharge was also applied to Austrian military stamps and postage due stamps, as well as to the 1904 postage dues of Bosnia.
In May, Austrian stamps were overprinted with the Ukrainian trident-in-shield arms with the letters "З. У. Н. Р." ("Z. U. N. R."), one at each corner, for "West Ukrainian People's Republic". These saw very little use, and forged cancellations are commonplace.
The sole non-overprinted issue was a pair of registration stamps issued in Kolomyia, in the form of a label used for registered mail, but unlike most labels, denominated with values of thirty and fifty shahs, to pay registration fees.
Of the stamps issued, only the trident overprints are common, with the others being rare.
The 1921 non-issued series.
Fourteen original designs are very common.

Stone picker

A stone picker (or rock picker) is an implement to remove the top layer of soil to separate and collect rocks and soil debris from good topsoil. It is usually tractor-pulled. A stone picker is similar in function to a rock windrower (rock rake); a stone picker generally digs to greater depths to remove stones and rocks.
Stone pickers are used in farming and landscaping, where stones need to be removed from the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm machinery (such as hay balers, combines, and mowers), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or reciprocating knives on a combine, and blades on a rotary mower. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops.
A stone picker has digging teeth, a conveyor system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth are at the leading edge of the stone picker and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some stone pickers use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the stone picker digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.

The Dock Brief

The Dock Brief (US title Trial and Error) is a 1962 black-and-white British legal satire directed by James Hill, starring Peter Sellers and Richard Attenborough, and based on the play of the same name written by John Mortimer (creator of Horace Rumpole).
Richard Attenborough was nominated for the 1963 BAFTA Award for best British Actor for his role.
Plot.
After 40 years of undistinguished practice Wilfred Morgenhall (Sellers), a cynical and unsuccessful barrister, is overjoyed to be assigned a "dock brief": the defence of an accused murderer.
His client Herbert Fowle (Attenborough), is a meek man who wants to plead guilty to murdering his wife. Through a series of courtroom scenes and flashbacks the lead-up to the crime unfolds, involving Fowle taking in a lodger (David Lodge), who takes a more-than-passing interest in Mrs. Fowle (Beryl Reid). Morgenhall, given an opportunity to shine for the first time in his life, insists on pleading his client "not guilty."
But the case does not go as planned: Morgenhall botches the pleadings and Fowle is found guilty. As Morgenhall drowns his sorrows in a pub, he learns that the Home Office has overruled the verdict: Fowle has been declared not guilty on the grounds that his defence was inadequate.
The film was released in the USA under the title "Trial and Error."
Reception.
According to MGM records, the film made a profit of $141,000.

Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)

Hans Krebs (4 March 1898 – 2 May 1945) was a German Army (Wehrmacht Heer) general of infantry who served during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Early life and career.
Krebs was born in Helmstedt. He volunteered for service in the Imperial German Army in 1914, was promoted to lieutenant in 1915, and to first lieutenant in 1925. Krebs was a career officer.
In 1931, he worked in the Defence Ministry. In 1936, Krebs became an assistant to the military attaché in Moscow. Krebs spoke fluent Russian. Thereafter, he reached the position of chief of staff of various army groups. While serving on the Eastern Front, Krebs was promoted to the rank of Generalmajor when Chief of Staff of the 9th Army in February 1942. In March 1943, he was made Chief of Staff of Army Group Centre. In April 1943, he was promoted to Generalleutnant and became a General of Infantry in August 1944. Krebs served as Chief of Staff of Army Group B on the Western Front from September 1944 until February 1945 when he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff.
Berlin 1945.
On 1 April 1945, Krebs was appointed Chief of the Army General Staff (OKH). Krebs was in the Führerbunker below the Reich Chancellery garden during the Battle of Berlin.
On 28 April 1945, Krebs made his last telephone call from the Führerbunker. He called Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel at the new Supreme Command Headquarters in Fürstenberg. He told Keitel that, if relief did not arrive within 48 hours, all was lost. Keitel promised to exert the utmost pressure on General Walther Wenck who commanded the German 12th Army and General Theodor Busse who commanded the German 9th Army. The 12th Army was attacking towards Berlin from the west and the 9th Army was attacking from the south. Adolf Hitler had ordered both of these armies to link up and come to the relief of Berlin. In addition, forces under General Rudolf Holste were to have attacked towards Berlin from the north.
Later on 28 April, when it was discovered that Heinrich Himmler was trying to negotiate a backdoor surrender to the western Allies via Count Folke Bernadotte, Krebs became part of a military tribunal ordered by Hitler to court-martial Himmler's SS liaison officer Hermann Fegelein. Fegelein, by that time was Eva Braun's brother-in-law. SS-General Wilhelm Mohnke presided over the tribunal which, in addition to Krebs and Mohnke, included SS-General Johann Rattenhuber and General Wilhelm Burgdorf. However, Fegelein was so drunk that he was determined to be in no condition to stand trial. Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned Fegelein over to Rattenhuber and his security squad.
On 29 April, Krebs, Burgdorf, Joseph Goebbels, and Martin Bormann witnessed and signed the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler. Hitler dictated the document to his personal private secretary, Traudl Junge. Bormann was head of the Party Chancellery ("Parteikanzlei") and private secretary to Hitler.
Late that evening, Krebs contacted General Alfred Jodl (Supreme Army Command) by radio and made the following demands: "Request immediate report. Firstly, of the whereabouts of Wenck's spearheads. Secondly, of time intended to attack. Thirdly, of the location of the 9th Army. Fourthly, of the precise place in which the 9th Army will break through. Fifthly, of the whereabouts of General Holste's spearhead."
In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: "Firstly, Wenck's spearhead bogged down south of Schwielow Lake. Secondly, 12th Army therefore unable to continue attack on Berlin. Thirdly, bulk of 9th Army surrounded. Fourthly, Holste's Corps on the defensive."
Later that day, Hitler committed suicide at around 15:30 hrs. 
Surrender and suicide.
On 1 May, after Hitler's suicide on 30 April, Goebbels sent Krebs and Colonel Theodor von Dufving, under a white flag, to deliver a letter he had written to General Vasily Chuikov. Dufving was General Helmuth Weidling's Chief of Staff. The letter contained surrender terms acceptable to Goebbels. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Krebs arrived shortly before 4 a.m. and took Chuikov by surprise. Krebs, who spoke Russian, informed Chuikov that Hitler and Eva Braun, his wife, had killed themselves in the Führerbunker. Chuikov, who was not aware that there was a bunker complex under the Reich Chancellery or that Hitler was married, calmly said that he already knew all of this. Chuikov was not, however, prepared to accept the terms in Goebbels' letter or to negotiate with Krebs. The Soviets were unwilling to accept anything other than unconditional surrender, as it was agreed with the other Allies. Krebs was not authorized by Goebbels to agree to such terms, however, and so the meeting ended with no agreement. According to Traudl Junge, Krebs returned to the bunker looking "worn out, exhausted". Krebs's surrender of Berlin was thus impeded as long as Goebbels was alive.
At around 8 p.m. on the evening of 1 May, Goebbels removed this impediment. Shortly after killing their own children, Goebbels and his wife, Magda, left the bunker complex and went up to the garden of the Reich Chancellery. They each bit on a cyanide ampule and either shot themselves at the same time, or were given a "coup de grâce" immediately afterwards by Goebbels' SS adjutant, Günther Schwägermann. Their bodies were then doused with petrol by Schwägermann and burned. After Goebbels' death, Krebs became suicidal. The responsibility for surrendering the city fell to General of the Artillery ("General der Artillerie") Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area.
On 2 May, with Krebs in no condition to do it himself, Weidling contacted General Chuikov to again discuss surrender. Weidling and Chuikov met and had the following conversation in which Chuikov asked about Krebs:
Chuikov: "You are the commander of the Berlin garrison?"
Weidling: "Yes, I am the commander of the LVI Panzer Corps."
Chuikov: "Where is Krebs?"
Weidling: "I saw him yesterday in the Reich Chancellery. I thought he would commit suicide. At first he (Krebs) criticized me because unofficial capitulation started yesterday. The order regarding capitulation has been issued today."
As the Soviets advanced on the Reich Chancellery, Krebs was last seen by others, including Junge, in the Führerbunker when they left to attempt to escape. Junge relates how she approached Krebs to say goodbye and how he straightened up and smoothed his uniform before greeting her for the last time. Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf, along with SS Untersturmführer Franz Schädle of the SS-Begleitkommando des Führers, stayed behind with the intention of committing suicide. Sometime in the early morning hours of 2 May, they committed suicide by gunshot to the head. The bodies of Krebs and Burgdorf were found when Soviet personnel entered the bunker complex. Schädle also committed suicide and Högl was wounded in the head while crossing the Weidendammer Bridge (during the break out) and died of his injuries on 2 May 1945.
Thereafter, the corpses of Krebs, the Goebbels family along with the remains of Hitler, Eva Braun and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed by the Soviets. The last burial had been at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team with detailed burial charts secretly exhumed five wooden boxes. The remains from the boxes were thoroughly burned and crushed, after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.

2008 Chatham Cup

The 2008 Chatham Cup is the New Zealand's 81st knockout football competition. The final was played on September 13 at North Harbour Stadium, North Shore.
In all, 132 teams took part in the 2008 competition. Note: there is some confusion as to the round numbers. Some publications list a preliminary round, a qualification round, and four rounds proper before quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final; others list a preliminary round and five rounds before the quarter-finals. the latter numbering system is used in this article.
The 2008 competition's final rounds were unusual for two reasons: only one of the four semi-finalists had ever previously reached the semi-finals (Dunedin Technical - the only team to have done so - won the cup in 1999), and two South Island teams reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1995. A change of venue for the final was mooted - possibly to Christchurch - had both finalists been South Island teams.
The 2008 final.
In the final, 1999 Cup-winners Dunedin Technical faced finals debutants East Coast Bays in front of a crowd of some 3000 spectators at North Harbour Stadium. Technical had the better of the early stages of the match, as East Coast Bays took time to settle, but were unable to press home any advantage. By the mid-stages of the half Bays had begun to exert their dominance, particularly in the midfield area. The only goal of the match came from a long Ryan Zoghby throw-in in the 34th minute which was deflected by Technical defender Blair Scoullar into his own net.
Technical responded well to being behind, increasing the pressure on the Bays defence throughout the second half, but were unable to square the match.
The Jack Batty Memorial Cup is awarded to the player adjudged to have made to most positive impact in the Chatham Cup final. The winner of the 2008 Jack Batty Memorial Cup was Ryan Zoghby of East Coast Bays.

Acueducto de Albear

The Acueducto de Albear (Albear Aqueduct) is the name of a water supply system of the city of Havana, Cuba built in the 19th century by Francisco de Albear.
Background.
At the beginning of the 19th century, the city of Havana, Cuba started to feel a severe shortage of drinking water. After having negotiated with several French engineers, in 1852, the Governor of Cuba José Gutiérrez de la Concha, decided to create a commission to propose solutions for the water supply of the city. The commission was to be chaired by Francisco de Albear, at that time colonel of the Corps of Engineers of the Spanish army and chairman of the Public Works Committee of Cuba. His main assistant was José Luis Casaseca, Director of the Institute of Chemical Investigations of Havana. The construction of a new water supply system was a necessity for the improvement of the sanitary conditions of the city. There had been severe outbreaks of cholera in 1850, 1856, 1865 and 1867-1870. The mortality due to disentery and other waterborne diseases was also high.
The investigations carried out by De Albear’s team were extensive. He investigated various alternatives among which the use of the Luyanó, Martín Pérez, Guasabacoa, Marianao or Almendares rivers as well of the Cacahual or del Calvario springs, all of which he rejected for various reasons. He finally settled for the use of the del Vento springs, both due to the superior water quality and for the possibility of conveying the water by gravity, the source being located 41 m higher than the city. Chemical studies carried out by José Luis Casaseca lead to the conclusion that the water of the del Vento springs had to be isolated from the Almendares River, to prevent a deterioration of the water quality, which was of great concern, due to the tropical location of the island.
However, it was only in 1855,that a second commission, chaired also by Francisco de Albear, started extensive geological and hydrological field surveys, to ascertain that the springs had the capacity to cover the water requirements of the city. Finally, on November 25, 1855 De Albear was able to present his report to Governor José Gutiérrez de la Concha.
Copies of the report were sent to the Ministers of Interior (Ministro de Gobernación) and of Public Works (Ministro de Fomento) in Madrid. The "Royal Decree for the conveyance of the water of the Vento springs to Havana" was signed on October 5, 1858. To ensure the financing, the decree suspended for three years all payments from the revenue generated by the Fernando II acqueduct, imposed an annual fee of 45 pesos for each water faucet and authorized the governorship to raise another 500,000 pesos through taxes, if necessary.
On February 18, 1859 Governor Gutiérrez de la Concha created the Administration of the de Vento canal, Board of Directors 
Main components of the project.
Though called an aqueduct, the project presented by De Albear is complex water supply system, including the following components: 
Technical features..
The canal has an oval cross section, being 2,40 m deep and having a maximum width of 1,98 m. With a slope of 1:5000 it can convey a discharge of 1,67 m³/s (144.000 m³/day) at normal water levels. However, at higher water levels the capacity of the canal can be increased to 302.800 m³/day. It should be taken into account that, according to the standards in force at the time the canal was designed, the water requirement was of 500 l/day per inhabitant
Construction of the water supply system.
In 1861, the construction started under the direction of Francisco de Albear. The progress was however extremely slow due to the scarcity of available funds and to the disturbances created by the Ten Years' War.
Work on the water distribution network started only in 1874 when Francisco de Albear made the first complete topographic survey of Havana and produced a 1:5000 plan of the city. Based on these surveys, he completed the design of the network and fixed the location of the water storage tanks.
In the meanwhile, the water supply of the city had worsened, as a result of the project’s construction delays. After the Peace of Zanjón was signed with the independentist rebels on February 10, 1878, the first part of the canal could finally be completed and, on June 23, 1878 the link of the De Vento Canal and the filters of the Fernando VII acqueduct could finally be inaugurated by Governor Arsenio Martínez-Campos Antón.
Completion of the project.
Francisco de Albear, infected with malaria, was not able to oversee the last part of the project. He died on October 22, 1887 without seeing its completion. The work was continued under the supervision of Joaquín Ruiz, colonel of the Corps of Engineers who had assisted de Albear.
The construction of the last part was contracted with an American company and coordinated by E. Sherman Gould, work started on January 31st, 1890.</ref> E. Sherman Gould – "The New Water-Works of Havana City", American Society of Civil Engineers, Transactions, No 790, December 1896.</ref>
The project was inaugurated on January 22, 1893, 45 years after its commencement.
Awards.
The project received a prize at the Centennial International Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. It was also distinguished with the Gold Medal of the Éxposition universelle of Paris 1878, where is was considered an engineering masterwork.
At present it is considered one of the seven wonders of Cuban engineering.

Christmas Island National Park

Christmas Island National Park is a national park occupying most of Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean southwest of Indonesia. The park is home to many species of animal and plant life, including the eponymous red crab, whose annual migration sees around 100 million crabs move to the sea to spawn. Christmas Island is the only nesting place for the endangered Abbott's Booby and critically endangered Christmas Island Frigatebird, and the wide range of other endemic species makes the island of significant interest to the scientific community.
History.
Concerns were expressed in the early 1970s about the effect of phosphate mining on the flora and fauna of Christmas Island. A particular focus was on the habitat of Abbott's Booby ("Papasula abbotti"), which appeared in danger of extinction. In 1974 a governmental committee examined the environmental impact of mining and other commercial activities and advised on measures to protect the island. The committee's recommendation that an area of the island be set aside for conservation was implemented in a series of measures culminating in the establishment of the Christmas Island National Park on 21 February 1980 under the terms of the "National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975".
The park initially covered the south-west corner of the island, and was extended in 1986 and 1989 to include most of the rainforest on the island. Today the park covers approximately , or 63% of the island.
Geology and geography.
Christmas Island consists of an uplifted limestone cap metamorphosed from coral reefs overlying more ancient volcanic andesite bedrock. The underlying seamount lies some southwest of Indonesia, and the isolation by the abyssal zone has led to endemism amongst the marine ecosystem. The park's boundaries extend beyond the low water line. Approximately of the island's shoreline is within the park limits.
Many stretches of the shoreline are marked by rock platforms, which are filled by wave splashes to create rock pools. Sea cliffs, up to high in places, rise steeply from the sea and form a series of stepped terraces, the lower cliffs of which are higher and steeper. Soil on the island is generally poor, punctuated by limestone pinnacles, and tends to dehydrate during the dry season. The limestone is fractured and has created a substantial underground cave system. There are both water-filled and dry caves.
Christmas Island's two Ramsar sites, The Dales and Hosnies Spring, are contained within the park.
Flora & fauna.
Both the waters surrounding the island and its land surface are fecund, and the park exhibits a high level of biodiversity with many endemic species.
Fauna.
Crabs.
The island is particularly noted for its prodigious populations of Christmas Island red crabs ("Gecarcoidea natalis"), whose mass migrations at spawning time may number over a hundred million individuals. The bright red carapaces and sheer density of crabs make their routes to the sea observable from the air. Nonetheless, the populations of red crabs are threatened by the arrival of the invasive yellow crazy ant ("Anoplolepis gracilipes"). The ant was accidentally introduced between 1915 and 1934, and without any native ant species to compete against, rapidly formed 'supercolonies' of extremely high density. Populations of the ant have been observed bringing down red crabs over a hundred times their combined biomass. "A. gracilipes" is thought responsible for killing up to 30 million of the park's crabs. 
While the red crab is Christmas Island's most numerous crab, the island also hosts the world's largest population of Coconut Crab ("Birgus latro"), the world's largest land invertebrate. There may be as many as one million coconut crabs on Christmas Island. It is also home to several species each of hermit crab, grapsids and gecarcinucoidea.
Reptiles.
There are six species of reptile native to the park, of which five are endemic: the giant gecko ("Cyrtodactylus sadlieri"), the Christmas Island gecko ("Lepidodactylus listeri"), the forest skink ("Emoia nativitatis"), the blue-tailed skink ("Cryptoblephanus egeriae") and the pink blind snake ("Ramphotyphlops exocoeti"). The foreshore skink ("Emoia atrocostata") is native to the park, but is also to be found on other islands of the Indian Ocean. All have been showing decline in recent years.
A further five species of reptile have been reported, but all were introduced by human activity: the barking gecko ("Hemidactylus frenatus"), house gecko ("Gehyra mutilata"), black blind snake ("Ramphotyphlops braminus"), wolf snake ("Lycodon aulicus capucinus") and grass skink ("Lygosoma bowringii").
Mammals.
There are three species of mammal native to the park: the Christmas Island Shrew ("Crocidura trichura"), listed as Critically Endangered, and possibly extinct; the small Christmas Island Pipistrelle ("Pipistrellus murrayi"), listed as Endangered and showing a rapid decrease in numbers; and the Christmas Island Flying Fox ("Pteropus melanotus"). The black rat ("Rattus rattus") and house mouse ("Mus musculus") have been introduced. Feral cats and dogs are also common, and stray into park territory.
Birds.
There are over 100 species of birds, of which ten are endemic. Many birds are passing vagrants, such as the Great Cormorant ("Phalacrocorax carbo"). Others, like the Lesser Frigatebird ("Fregata ariel"), are more regular visitors. Bird populations are threatened due to the invasive yellow crazy ant, and reports have suggested that the ant has attacked hatchlings and harassed adults in their nests. All endemic bird species have been placed on the critically endangered list.
Flora.
The dominant vegetation on the island is rainforest. Approximately 200 species of native flowering plant are to be found on Christmas Island. There are no mangroves on the park's coast. However, a stand of the normally estuarine mangrove species, "Bruguiera gymnorhiza" and "B. sexangula", is found approximately above sea level, at Hosnies Spring.
Park management.
The park is managed by Parks Australia, a division of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Parks Australia's activities are mandated by the "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999". Its duties include protection of the park's natural areas, its lifeforms and genetic resources, to maintain ecological diversity, and to manage visitor access for educational, cultural and recreational purposes. It latest management plan (2002) listed control of the yellow crazy ant as its highest priority.
The park administration has a staff of 17, and operates out of an office in Drumsite on the northern side of the island.

Anarcho-capitalism and minarchism

Anarcho-capitalism and minarchism are two distinct strains of libertarianism. Although anarcho-capitalists and minarchists agree on most political issues, they are sometimes hostile towards each other, particularly because most adherents of both philosophies support the non-aggression principle and see the opposing philosophy of misrepresenting its political implications.
Philosophical disagreements.
Anarcho-capitalism advocates abolishing the state. Minarchism has been variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it is the political philosophy which maintains that the state is necessary and that its only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Minarchist states are called night-watchman states.
Minarchists generally justify the state on the grounds that it is the logical consequence of adhering to the non-aggression principle. They argue that anarchism is immoral because it implies that the non-aggression principle is optional. They argue that this is because the enforcement of laws under anarchism is open to competition. Another common justification is that private defense and court firms would tend to represent the interests of those who pay them enough. Anarcho-capitalists generally argue that the state violates the non-aggression principle by its nature because governments use force against those who have not stolen private property, vandalized private property, assaulted anyone, or committed fraud. Many also argue that monopolies tend to be corrupt and inefficient.
Murray Rothbard argues that all government services, including defense, are inefficient because they lack a market-based pricing mechanism regulated by the voluntary decisions of consumers purchasing services that fulfill their highest-priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in. Therefore, the state's monopoly on the use of force is a violation of natural rights. He wrote, "The defense function is the one reserved most jealously by the State. It is vital to the State's existence, for on its monopoly of force depends its ability to extract taxes from the citizens. If citizens were permitted privately owned courts and armies, then they would possess the means to defend themselves against invasive acts by the government as well as by private individuals." In his book "Power and Market", he argued that geographically large minarchist states are indifferent from a unified minarchist world monopoly government. Rothbard wrote governments were not inevitable, noting that it often took hundreds of years for aristocrats to set up a state out of anarchy. He also argued that if a minimal state allows individuals to freely secede from the current jurisdiction to join a competing jurisdiction, then it does not by definition constitute a state.
Anarcho-capitalists generally argue that private defense and court agencies would have to have a good reputation in order to stay in business. Furthermore, Linda & Morris Tannehill argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market and that a government's citizenry can’t desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency.
Interpretations.
Libertarian philosopher Moshe Kroy argues that the disagreement between anarcho-capitalists who adhere to Murray Rothbard's view of human consciousness and the nature of values and minarchists who adhere to Ayn Rand's view of human consciousness and the nature of values over whether or not the state is moral is not due to a disagreement over the correct interpretation of a mutually held ethical stance. He argues that the disagreement between these two groups is instead the result of their disagreement over the nature of human consciousness and that each group is making the correct interpretation of their differing premises. These two groups are therefore not making any errors with respect to deducing the correct interpretation of any ethical stance because they do not hold the same ethical stance.
History of debate.
The debate over which philosophy is preferable has been most notably debated by anarchists Murray Rothbard, David Friedman, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Walter Block, Bryan Caplan, and Roderick Long, and minarchists Ludwig von Mises, Ayn Rand, Tibor Machan, and Robert Nozick.
The U.S. Libertarian Party sought to be a "big tent" party when it was founded by welcoming both factions into its midst. The 1974 Libertarian National Convention adopted the Dallas Accord, which made the platform of the Libertarian Party purposefully ambiguous on the desirability of the state's existence. This involved using such phrases as "where governments exist, they must not violate the rights of any individual" in the statement of principles. In 2006, delegates to a national convention added the following language to the section on "Crime and Justice": "Government exists to protect the rights of every individual including life, liberty and property." This led some to conclude that anarchists were no longer welcome in the party.

Burzyn, Podlaskie Voivodeship

Burzyn is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Jedwabne, within Łomża County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland. It lies approximately east of Jedwabne, north-east of Łomża, and west of the regional capital Białystok.
Geography.
Burzyn is located on the west side of the Biebrza River bordering Biebrza National Park. Villages and farms are located along this elevated western shore of the river while the eastern side is a large Marsh that floods every spring.
History.
Burzyn is first mentioned in August 23, 1428, when the Duke of Mazovia, Janusz I of Warsaw, gave the land to Nicholas of Krassow. In about 1482, Burzyn village was owned by Stanislaw Piroga of Lomza whose descendant Andrew moved to the town and took the surname Burzynski. In 1643, Burzyn passed into the hands of families Kapiców - Milewski via marriage to Anna Burzynska.
The population of Burzyn in 1830 was 320 people. By 1906, the population had declined to 199 persons, including 100 women, 93 men, and four Jews.
During the early 20th century, there was immigration to the United States which further contributed to the population decline. The descendants of former Mayor Stanislaus Karwowski moved to the New York metropolitan area in the United States and now outnumber their hometown.
Early in World War II, the German and Soviet Armies collaborated to pacify Poland. In September 1939, this river valley was a front in the Battle of Wizna with Burzyn located at the northern end of the German attack. The area was transferred to the Soviet Union at the end of September in accordance with the German–Soviet Boundary Treaty and remained in Soviet hands until Operation Barbarossa in July 1941.
The transfer to Soviet Army control was resisted by locals. In December 1939, Father Szumowski and Father Cudnik formed a secret partisan network involving Biebrza villages from Rutkowskie in the south to Radzilow in the north. The task of the group was to accumulate arms for an anti-Soviet uprising and to carry out death sentences on collaborators. Probably as a result of betrayal, on the morning of June 23, 1940, the Soviet Army and the NKVD surrounded the conspiracy's headquarters. Nine guerrillas were killed and seven were captured. One of the consequences of breaking up the network were mass arrests. Waves of arrests, expulsions and prison executions continued until June 20–21, 1941 when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union.
The invasion, however, did not stop the NKVD efforts to wipe out subversion. In June 1941, Father Cudnik died during the "death march" from Minsk prison. Germans occupied the Burzyn area for the rest of the war. By late 1944, the residents of the village were forced to hide in the Biebrza in dugouts or were evacuated into the community of Jedwabne. Liberation came in January 1945.
In the years 1975-1998, the town administratively belonged to the province of Lomza.
In 2010, the population was 86.
Economy.
The focus of the community is farming. Tractors are parked along the street during Sunday Mass.
According to the town renewal strategy, there is an undeveloped Ecotourism and Agritourism opportunity given the natural resources in the area. The first step in this program was an EU funded beautification project including a bandstand and sidewalks. The next phase of development will be a cobblestone street.
Religion.
Burzyn's first church was built in 1710 and was made of wood. It sat on bluff overlooking the Biebrza River near the present church. In addition to the church, the parish ran an elementary school in Burzyn in 1818 which was located in a rented building and attended by 23 boys.
The wooden church was demolished in 1830 following the construction of a new brick church which was built in the years 1824 to 1830 with support from the foundation of Andrew Rembielińskieg of Jedwabne, the son of Raymond - a prominent economic and political activist of the Polish Kingdom. The church was destroyed during the war of 1915. From 1918-1920, the parish operated from a small wooden church, which was later demolished in 1975.
Thanks to the efforts of Fr. Czeslaw Domel between 1973-1978, the community built the present two-story brick structure. It was consecrated on 22/10/1978 by Auxiliary Bishop Tadeusz Zawistowski. From 1995-2000, Fr. prob. Stanislaus Bokińca guided efforts that made murals in the church, and restored the upper stations of the cross from the old church.
The Roman Catholic cemetery is located approximately 350 m to the northwest from the parish church, on the way to Radziłów.
The current priest in the Parish of Burzyn is Father Wiesław Pac. The parish has old vital records (birth, death, marriage) which are available at the church or through the LDS family history library.
Although the town of Burzyn is small, the Church covers a parish with several communities including:

Deirdre Hyde (born 1953, Somerset, England) is a British artist. She started her studies in Sherborne in 1963 and graduated with BA Honors in 1970. In 1975 she graduated in Fine Arts from University of Reading and in 1977 she obtained her Certificate of Education for the UK.
Biography.
Deirdre Hyde has been working continuously for the past thirty five years. Her work is also included in collections such as that of the Duke of Edinburgh, the Smithsonian Institution, National Geographic Society, and Canning House as well as private and public collections worldwide.
She has created a 130 meter long mural for Frank Gehry’s Biomuseo in Panama.
Hyde trained as a fine artist at Reading University in the 70s, taught by Terry Frost, John Hoyland, Martin Froy and David Hockney. Her main influences were the then unfashionable figurative painters Ray Atkins, Frank Auerbach and John Wonnacott.
In her twenties she was inspired by the adventurous tradition of Maria Sibylla Merian, Emilio Spann, Frederick Catherwood, Margaret Mee and Marianne North. She spent time chronicling the threatened nature of Central America.
Her work from this time has been reproduced in museums and publications throughout Europe and the Americas from Norway to Brazil.
Since 2008 Hyde has produced an new body of work based on images from her travels. Light and the elements provide the emotional charge to these large format acrylic canvases. Her images encompass everything from classical sculpture to urban street life, transforming the mundane.
Hyde repeatedly refers to Greek sculptures. People are portrayed suspended in a moment of awakening, caught in either air or water in the off balanced flow revealed by modern vision. A hint of the ominous often encroaches on the ecstatic moment, adding a sinister undertow to the most celebratory image.

Steve Schmidt

Steve Schmidt (born 1970) is an American campaign strategist and public relations worker for the U.S. Republican Party. He specializes in political "message development and strategy." Schmidt was the senior campaign strategist and advisor to the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. He is currently a political analyst for MSNBC and also appears frequently on Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO.
Early life and education.
The son of a school teacher and a businessman, Schmidt grew up in North Plainfield, New Jersey, was an Eagle Scout, a tight end on the high school football team, a two-year member of the National Honor Society, and senior class vice president. In 1988, he was one of two graduating seniors voted "most likely to succeed" by his classmates at North Plainfield High School. He first handed out campaign materials for Democrat Bill Bradley's 1978 Senate campaign.
Schmidt attended the University of Delaware from 1988 through the spring of 1993, majoring in political science. He left three credits short of graduating because he did not pass a math course; Schmidt has said that he has been diagnosed with a learning disability that makes higher math difficult for him. He joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, was a member of the campus Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program, and did field work for Republican candidates in Delaware, sometimes wearing campaign buttons to class.
Career.
Early campaigns.
In 1995, Steve Schmidt managed the unsuccessful campaign for Kentucky Attorney General of Will T. Scott, who is now a Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court. This Kentucky campaign's advertising strategy was featured in the second edition of "George Magazine". In 1998, Schmidt ran California State Senator Tim Leslie's unsuccessful race for Lt. Governor of California. Also that year, he was the Communications Director for California State Treasurer Matt Fong's unsuccessful campaign to unseat U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. In 1999, he was the Communications Director for Lamar Alexander's presidential run, leaving in June when the campaign reduced its senior staff.
Washington, D.C..
By late 2000, Schmidt was communications director of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
In 2001, he was the spokesman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, becoming the Communications Director by 2002. He left the NRCC in early 2003 to work for the lobbying firm Direct Impact Company.
Schmidt joined the Bush administration as a Deputy Assistant to the President and Counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney. In 2004, he was a member of the senior strategic planning group, led by White House adviser Karl Rove, that ran President George W. Bush's re-election campaign; Schmidt oversaw the reelection "war room". In 2005 and 2006, he was the White House strategist responsible for the U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.
California.
In 2006, Schmidt left the White House to become the campaign manager in the re-election campaign for California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. From there, he became a partner in Mercury Public Affairs, part of Fleishman-Hillard International Communications, in charge of Mercury's operations in California.
2008 McCain presidential campaign.
On July 2, 2008, Schmidt was appointed to head up day to day operations of the McCain campaign in response to concerns that the campaign lacked coordination and a clear message. Rick Davis retained the formal title of "campaign manager".
Press commentary.
"The New York Times" described Schmidt's management as having transformed the McCain campaign into "an elbows-out, risk-taking, disciplined machine," crediting him with aggressive responses to press criticism and creative methods of manipulating the news cycle.
"Time"'s Michael Scherer, in an opinion piece from September 15, 2008 relating to Schmidt's involvement with John McCain's presidential campaign stated that Schmidt, the "lord of outrage, has a long and prosperous career ahead of him."
Stance on gay rights.
Schmidt voiced his support for gay rights at meeting of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican group. He said: "I just wanted to take a second to come by and pay my respect and the campaign's respect to your organization and to your group. Your organization is an important one in the fabric of our party." 
Schmidt said about his lesbian sister and her life partner: "On a personal level, my sister and her partner are an important part of my life and our children's life. I admire your group and your organization and I encourage you to keep fighting for what you believe in because the day is going to come."
In February 2013, Schmidt along with 74 other Republicans co-signed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States in support of overturning Proposition 8. “The die is cast on this issue when you look at the percentage of younger voters who support gay marriage,” he was quoted as saying. “As Dick Cheney said years ago, ‘Freedom means freedom for everybody.’ ”
"Game Change".
Schmidt is played by Woody Harrelson in the HBO film "Game Change". The film, based on chapters of the book of the same title by political journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, focuses on the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate in the 2008 United States presidential election. Schmidt is portrayed as initially pushing for the choice of Palin, before later thinking she was unqualified for the job and had limited knowledge of current affairs. The real Schmidt voiced his approval of the film, saying that "it tells the truth of the campaign" and that watching the film was tantamount to "an out-of-body experience."

Dallas Accord

The Dallas Accord was an implicit agreement made at the 1974 Libertarian National Convention to compromise between the larger minarchist and smaller anarcho-capitalist factions by adopting a platform that explicitly did not say whether it was desirable for the state to exist.
The purpose of the Dallas Accord was to make the Libertarian Party of the United States a "big tent" that would welcome more ideologically diverse groups of people interested in reducing the size of government. Therefore, the 1974 platform focused on statements arguing for getting government out of various activities, and used phrases such as "where governments exist..." It was agreed that the topic of anarchism would not even be on the table for discussion until a limited government were achieved.
During the following years the number of anarchists in the party dropped by about half and more conservative-oriented and constitutionalist members joined. During the 2006 Libertarian National Convention delegates deleted a large portion of the very detailed platform. They added the phrase "Government exists to protect the rights of every individual including life, liberty and property." This development has been described as the "Portland Massacre". Some took this as meaning the Dallas Accord was dead. Delegates tried in 2008 to restore the platform, without success. Anarchist do continue to work in the party and run for office. Anarchist philosophies of no government still are supported by planks of the party platform, one of which describes the "right to alter of abolish government" and another which states that "Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval."

Hot spot (veterinary medicine)

In veterinary medicine, a "hot spot" (or acute pyoderma, acute moist pyotraumatic dermatitis (AMPD)) is one of the many names for a raw, painful, irritated skin lesion that results in and worsens from a pet (such as a dog or a cat) constantly biting, scratching, chewing, and licking an area of its skin that is irritated or itchy. If it is covered by the dog's hair, the hair holds in the moisture and further irritates it.
It is a patch that appears suddenly and is often bright red, hairless, and scaly looking. It may be moist, and when touched it may ooze pus on the surface. It may hurt, and feel hot to the touch. A bacterial infection may develop. 
As the lesion grows, secondary infection from opportunistic bacteria can occur, causing more discomfort and leading the pet to scratch and chew even more. 
Other names include wet eczema, moist eczema, summer sores, acute moist alderman, acute moist dermatitis, pyo traumatic dermatitis, or acute pyo traumatic dermatitis. As the nickname "summer sores" suggests, hot spots are more common in the summer; however, the ailment can occur at any time of the year. Many pets that develop them have allergies; they are particularly common in pets with flea allergies. However, "any" sort of irritation to the skin can result in a hot spot.
Treatment.
Treatment may include cleaning the spot, and applying a topical liquid cortisone, or giving benadryl, giving a steroid shot, and/or giving antibiotics.
Locations.
Most hot spots occur on the paws and skin.

Jack Healey

Jack Healey (born 1938) is an American human rights activist and pioneer. Working in the human rights movement for over 47 years, Jack has helped move the topic of human rights from closed-door diplomatic negotiations to widespread awareness, public debate, and direct citizen action.
Called "Mr. Human Rights" by U.S. News and World Report, Healey’s focus has been on inspiring the youth to support non-violent activism that would push back oppressive governments and societies.
Jack heads the Washington, D.C. based Human Rights Action Center (HRAC), a qualified Non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.
His projects are: printing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into all passports and bringing Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to power in Burma. Burma: It Can’t Wait.
Background.
Born into an Irish-American Catholic family as the youngest of eleven children, Healey grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. His mother was a teacher and his father was a metallurgist at Superior Steel, a steel rolling plant located in Pittsburgh.
He studied at St. Fidelis Seminary for high school and college and received a masters degree from Catholic University. He was a Franciscan monk for 10 years and a Catholic priest for four years. He left the priesthood in 1968 and began work as Director of the Young World Development Program at 'Freedom from Hunger Foundation' USA for five years.
At the 'Young World Development Program', Healey produced over 300 Walks for Development. 12 million dollars were raised from these walks and given to national and international non-profits, including Meals for Millions, The Free Clinic, and Freedom Farm Co-op of Fannie Lu Hamer. They also funded Catholic Relief Service, Church World Service, Heifer, and Oxfam International and other international non-profit organizations. These walks became the model for future walk-a-thons.
From 1973 to 1976, Healey worked at the Center For Community Change in Washington, D.C. At the center, Healey helped to build the Binder Schweitzer Hospital in Mexico and co-directed the Dick Gregory World Hunger Run across the United States. Dick Gregory won the Dawson Award from the Black Caucus for this run. Healey, along with George O’Hara, recruited Muhammed Ali to join Dick’s Hunger Run.
From 1977 until 1981 Healey directed the Peace Corps in Lesotho. Healey was one of the few Peace Corps directors asked to stay in the same country for his second tour. During his time as director of the Peace Corps, he was also a presence on morning, afternoon and evening shows such as Oprah, 60 Minutes and Nightline.
After finishing his tour with the Peace Corps, he worked as the Director of Amnesty International USA for 12 years. His work at Amnesty brought human rights to the forefront of popular culture by pioneering new ways to deliver the message of human rights to new generations. He helped bring young people into the human rights movement by organizing concerts with well known artists, and by reaching out to high schools and colleges through motivational speeches. 
Healey has received seven honorary doctorates and spoken in over a thousand colleges and high schools. He has produced three music albums and Douye, a documentary on Aung San Suu Kyi. Additionally, Healey worked as a consultant to both the Center of Victims of Torture in Haiti, and to comedian Dick Gregory on the topic of world hunger.
Healey helped to start the Reebok Human Rights Foundation, which hands out the Reebok Human Rights Award each year, and two other non-profits, Witness (human rights group) and Equality Now.
Healey gained attention in 1990 when he worked with other human rights activists to block the entrance to a UN Human Rights conference set to take place in Vienna, because the UN refused to seat the Dalai Lama. In 1992, Healey spoke out against the US government when Haitian refugees fleeing harm from a dictatorial government were turned away from the United States border. Healey campaigned to free Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Current work.
Healey has created Human Rights Action Center, a qualified non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C.
Mission:
The Human Rights Action Center is a non-profit based out of Washington, D.C. that works on the issues of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Aung San Suu Kyi.
Five main goals:
1. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (more under Media)
Because less than 5% of the world knows of the existence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and less than 1% has read the Declaration, HRAC campaigns to get governments to print this document into all passports. Healey believes that if the declaration is in all passports, it becomes accessible to all citizens of the world, and can be used in the fight to extend basic human rights to every man, woman and child.
Each year, Healey organizes events around the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. HRAC produced the 50th anniversary concert for the United Nations celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At this concert, artists Wynton Marsalis and Luciano Pavarotti performed. For the 60th anniversary, last year, HRAC produced an animated version of this document as a way to connect with young people online.
2. Rightfully restore Aung San Suu Kyi to power in Burma. (more under Media Projects)
In 1991 Jack met with Michael Aris (husband of Aung San Suu Kyi) and promised his help in working to free Suu Kyi. In 1999 Healey met with Aung San Suu Kyi and again promised his support for her campaign. He works in conjunction with the US Campaign for Burma. Together they are raising global awareness about Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy and the people of Burma who are non-violently fighting against the power of the military Junta.
HRAC's Jack Healey also speaks at forums for this cause and he serves as senior advisor to the US Campaign for Burma. In 2008, to promote the Burma: It Can’t Wait campaign and address Cyclone Nargis, Healey organized a press conference at the United Nations with actress/director Anjelica Huston.
HRAC also sponsored a concert for the Burmese cause in Bangkok in 1999 featuring Glen Phillips, Raven-Symoné and Breeze.
3. Create innovative, forceful, effective solutions to assist victims in protecting themselves.
In Northern Ireland, in 1995, Healey created the organization Families for Families, an organization that protected Irish families from police brutality by linking them directly with American families who pledged to bring media attention to any mistreatment of the Irish family by police.
4. Support growing human rights groups all over the world
HRAC arranged for the financing of rebuilding a factory in Bosnia, which now employs over 900 women.
HRAC has worked with the Human Rights Center in Haiti as a consultant, preparing a human rights campaign strategy for the organization, evaluating the effectiveness of the Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims in Haiti.
HRAC created Families for Families, an organization based in Ireland that protected families from the terrors of police brutality.
""'5. Create a fund to get people out of harm's way in exceptional human rights abuse cases.

MTV and Fox Network both ran the last show internationally for a period of eleven hours, and the show won a national award and brought the show into the colleges and high schools of the United States. Because of the success of the show, Healey was recognized by MTV as humanitarian of the year. The tour was co-produced by Bill Graham, Mary Daly and Jack Healey.

In 1988, for the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, Healey organized the 6-week Human Rights Now!

Over a million people filled the stadiums, and crowded into fields for concerts in South America, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. The concert was broadcast to over one billion people worldwide. The tour covered 18 countries in six weeks, and won the Pollster Reader’s Award for number of viewers, beating out Michael Jackson’s worldwide tour. HBO covered this show on a 3-hour special. This show tripled the membership of Amnesty International worldwide.
Musicians included Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour
1990: From A Hug to a Hope Concert
As a celebration of the human rights victory in Chile after the fall of dictator Pinochet, Healey organized a two-day concert with Sting, Peter Gabriel, Sinéad O'Connor, Jackson Browne, Ruben Blades, Wynton Marsalis and New Kids on the Block.
The show took place in a stadium previously used as a prison for political dissidents, and a home to some of the many tortures and executions that took place under Pinochet’s rule. Families of the victims of the prison attended the concert, and celebrated the great victory for the Chilean people and for human rights activists around the world.
This live show was broadcast 10 hours a day for 2 days to all of Latin America, Mexico and Spain. As a result of the concert, Jackson Browne was able to free two political prisoners still jailed in Chile.

The 8/8/88 Uprising in Burma was a national revolution demanding democracy. It took place on August 8, 1988. This show took place on September 9, 1999 (9.9.99). The emphasis on the date was a reminder to the military that the world was carefully watching.
