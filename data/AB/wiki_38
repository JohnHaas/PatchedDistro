RTI-150

RTI-150, ((-)-2β-Carbocyclobutoxy-3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane) is a phenyltropane derivative which acts as a potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor and stimulant drug. It is around 5x more potent than cocaine, but is more selective for the dopamine transporter relative to the other monoamine transporters. RTI-150 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its abuse potential in animal studies is similar to that of cocaine itself; its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with the rapid entry of RTI-150 into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals. RTI-150 is not explicitly illegal anywhere in the world, but its similar structure and pharmacological activity to cocaine makes it possible that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue in countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand which have controlled substance analogue legislation.

Architectural plan

An architectural plan is a plan for architecture, and the documentation of written and graphic descriptions of the architectural elements of a building project including sketches, drawings and details.
Overview.
The term "Architectural plan" can have multiple related meanings:
This article will focus on the general meaning of architectural plan as a plan and documentation for a building project.
An architectural plan is a type of plan for architecture to describe a place or object, or to communicate building or fabrication instructions. It can containing technical architectural drawings and documentation, and are drawn or printed on paper, but they can take the form of a digital file. Their purpose in these disciplines is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a site, building, product or component. Plans can also be for presentation or orientation purposes, and as such are often less detailed versions of the former. The end goal of plans is either to portray an existing place or object, or to convey enough information to allow a builder or manufacturer to realize a design.
Types of architectural plans.
Floor plan.
A floor plan in architecture and building engineering is a diagram, usually to scale, of the relationships between rooms, spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure. Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans will also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans will include notes to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.
Similar to a map in a floor plan the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional map, a plan is understood to be drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 3 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. Plan view or "planform" is defined as a vertical orthographic projection of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.
Garden design.
Garden design is the art and process of designing and creating plans for layout and planting of gardens and landscapes. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional garden designers are trained in principles of design and in horticulture, and have an expert knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also landscape architects, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Many amateur gardeners also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study or Master Gardener Programs offered by the American Horticultural Society.
Landscape plan.
Landscape planning is a branch of landscape architecture. Urban park systems and greenways of the type planned by Frederick Law Olmsted are key examples of urban landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners can look beyond the 'closely drawn technical limits' and 'narrowly drawn territorial boundaries' which constrain design projects.
Landscape planners tend to work on projects which:
In rural areas, the damage caused by unplanned mineral extraction was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.
A site plan is an architectural plan, and a detailed engineering drawing of proposed improvements to a given lot. A site plan usually shows a building footprint, travelways, parking, drainage facilities, sanitary sewer lines, water lines, trails, lighting, and landscaping.
Such a plan of a site is a graphic representation of the arrangement of buildings, parking, drives, landscaping and any other structure that is part of a development project.
A site plan is a set of construction drawings that a builder or contractor uses to make improvements to a property. Counties can use the site plan to verify that development codes are being met and as a historical resource. Site plans are often prepared by a design consultant who must be either a licensed engineer, architect, landscape architect or land survey. The architect Map is part of a plan in Chandler, AZ.

Urban plan.
Urban, city, and town planning is the integration of the disciplines of land use planning and transport planning, to explore a very wide range of aspects of the built and social environments of urbanized municipalities and communities. Regional planning deals with a still larger environment, at a less detailed level.
Based upon the origins of urban planning from the Roman (pre-Dark Ages) era, the current discipline revisits the synergy of the disciplines of urban planning, architecture and landscape architecture, varying upon from the interlectural strategic positioning from university to university.
Another key role of urban planning is urban renewal, and re-generation of inner cities by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from long-term infrastructural decay. The picture below is an architecture map of a part of south Chandler, AZ.
Architectural plan topics.
Plan.
A plan is typically any procedure used to achieve an objective. It is a set of intended actions, through which one expects to achieve a goal. Plans can be formal or informal:
The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short-and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories. It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan
Plan view.
A plan view is an orthographic projection of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a horizontal plane through the object. In other words, a plan is a section viewed from the top. In such views, the portion of the object in above the plane is omitted to reveal what lies beyond. In the case of a floor plan, the roof and upper portion of the walls may be omitted.
Roof plans are orthographic projections, but they are not sections as their viewing plane is outside of the object. A plan is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is often used in technical drawing and is traditionally crosshatched. The style of crosshatching indicates the type of material the section passes through.
Planning.
Planning in organizations and public policy is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan; and the psychological process of thinking about the activities required to create a desired goal on some scale. As such, it is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior. This thought process is essential to the creation and refinement of a plan, or integration of it with other plans, that is, it combines forecasting of developments with the preparation of scenarios of how to react to them.
The term is also used to describe the formal procedures used in such an endeavor, such as the creation of documents diagrams, or meetings to discuss the important issues to be addressed, the objectives to be met, and the strategy to be followed. Beyond this, planning has a different meaning depending on the political or economic context in which it is used.

Cursed Mountain

Cursed Mountain is a survival horror-adventure video game for the Wii developed by Sproing Interactive, in collaboration with, and published by Deep Silver Vienna. It was released on August 25, 2009, in North America. The game focuses on a mountaineer searching for his lost brother in the Himalayas. A PC version of the game was released on February 5, 2010, in Europe. It is available globally via digital download on GamersGate.
Gameplay.
Combat primarily consists of encounters with the angry souls of monks and climbers who are trapped in Bardo, a spiritual realm in between this life and the next. The player must stun the enemies and make gestures with the Wii Remote to free their souls. The game also makes use of other features of the Wii Remote, such as its built-in speaker.
Plot.
"Cursed Mountain" is set in the late 1980s, due to the lack of technology available in the time period. The entire course of the game takes place on a mountain in the Himalayas named Chomolonzo, which the natives call "the Sacred One". The protagonist, Eric Simmons, is searching for his lost brother, Frank, who was hired by Edward Bennett to retrieve a sacred artifact called a terma. The goddess of the mountain became angry, and she bestowed a powerful curse upon Chomolonzo, trapping Frank and everyone who could not escape in time. The storyline of the game is heavily influenced by Buddhism and Tibetan folklore.
Development.
"Cursed Mountain" was a collaborative development effort by 16 companies consisting of 236 people in 17 unique locations in 14 different countries.
Reception.
"N-Zone" magazine gave the game a score of 82%. Praise was given to the game's pacing and atmosphere, with criticism aimed at the game's sometimes sluggish controls. Blast magazine awarded the game a 7.7 out of 10, stating that the "story, setting and atmosphere are the keys to Cursed Mountain" while "the controls or pacing frustrate you a bit". About.com was less enthusiastic, giving the game a 3 out of 5 and referring to the controls as "infuriating" and the finale as "laughably pretentious." IGN and GameSpot both awarded the title a score of 7.5 praising the atmosphere and game play.
Koch, the owner of Deep Silver Vienna, closed the studio on January 30, 2010.

The first mentions of Drozdowo come from as far back as 1417. By the middle of the 19th century, the town and surrounding land belonged to the estates of the szlachta Lutosławski family. Starting from 1864, Drozdowo had a functional brewery, the product of which quickly became well known in the area, thanks to access to pristine water and expert workers. Drozdowo beer was awarded first prize at competitions in Warsaw in 1867 and Vienna in 1873, opening the markets for it both in the Polish Kingdom and abroad. It was later awarded first prize at similar competitions in Philadelphia in 1876 and Paris in 1878.
Unfortunately, Drozdowo was on the fronts of World War I and II. Already after WW I the extent of damage was so big that neither the estates nor brewery ever regained their former grandeur. After the war, most of the inhabitants of Drozdowo resided to farming, and the last members of the Lutosławski family left the village in 1979.

Eupatorium hyssopifolium

Eupatorium hyssopifolium, also known as Hyssopleaf thoroughwort, is a fall-blooming herbaceous plant native to North America. Like other members of the genus "Eupatorium" it has inflorescences containing a large number of white flowers with disc florets and no ray florets. At 0.5 to one meter tall, it is towards the shorter end of the range of heights found in "Eupatorium" species.
Plants which classified as "E. hyssopifolium" can be either diploid or polyploid, and some of them seem to have been the result of past hybridizations with "Eupatorium serotinum". Hybrids with "Eupatorium album" and "Eupatorium linearifolium" also seem to exist. The hybrid "Eupatorium torreyanum" is similar to "E. hyssopifolium" but is a hybrid of "E. serotinum" and "Eupatorium mohrii".
"E. hyssopifolium" is found in much of the eastern United States, as far north as New York and Illinois, as far west as Texas, and as far south as Florida. It grows in moist soils.
Uses.
The plant can be used medicinally (applied externally for insect and reptile bites). It can also be planted near crops to attract beneficial insects.

Kaleldo

Kaleldo (English:Summer Heat) is a 2006 Filipino drama directed and written by Brillante Mendoza with Boots Agbayani Pastor. Kaleldo is a Kapampangan term for summer.
Plot.
The story is set in Guagua, Pampanga a decade after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo which ravaged the province with lahar. It follows the lives of Rodolfo "Mang Rudy" Manansala, a woodcarver, and his three daughters and their relationships with the people close to them in the span of seven summers. Grace, the youngest daughter, marries the mama's boy Conrad, and has to face the reality of leaving the ancestral house, to which she is deeply rooted, to go and live with her in-laws. Much against her will, to the point of staging an escape, she yields to the dictates of tradition. Yet she manages to cope up with married life, and on the fourth year of her marriage gets pregnant with her second child. Lourdes, the middle daughter and married to the weakling Andy Pineda with whom she has a daughter, goes into an illicit affair with a bank manager, for which reason Mang Rudy succumbs to a heart attack and becomes bedridden. For a while numbed by the infidelity of his wife, Andy later realizes his insignificance and retaliates by beating up and nearly killing Lourdes. Lourdes atones for her guilt by ministering to Andy's wounds after he joins the rituals of the flagellants during the Holy Week. However, they both decide to separate. Jess, the eldest daughter, is a lesbian whose bitter luck in life is being unwanted by her own father. Yet she serves Mang Rudy to the hilt after he gets bedridden and makes the common sense of allowing her girlfriend Rowena to move in at the Manansala house, not so much for their own convenience as lovers but for Rowena to help in looking after Mang Rudy and in helping out with the household chores. But when a conflict arises between Lourdes and Rowena, Mang Rudy sends Rowena away. A year later, Mang Rudy succumbs to a second attack and when he dies several months later, Rowena sets foot on the ancestral house once more to pay her last respects. At the wake, Rowena comes to the realization that, like Andy, she never belonged and finally decides to leave Jess. Rowena gets married while Jess, along with her sisters, moves on with life. The story is told in three segments, with each segment told from the point of view of the three daughters. Attached to each segment are social occasion popularly observed in the province of Pampanga in the Philippines, with a symbolic motif for each, represented by the elements sun, fire, water, air, blood, moon and earth. With Rowena's wedding at the end of the film, as in Grace's wedding at the start, a full cycle of life transpired.

Ribman was an Assistant Professor of English Literature at Otterbein College from 1962 to 1963, and left academia to focus on his plays in 1964 to the present.
Literature.
Ribman's poetry first appeared in literary magazines as "The Beloit Poetry Journal" and "The Colorado Quarterly". Ribman's first commercial publication was an article, co-authored with his father, in the April 1964 issue of "Harper's Magazine", titled "The Poor Man in the Scales," a study of the problems faced by indigent defendants in the federal courts. Ribman's most famous early play, "The Journey of the Fifth Horse" based on Ivan Turgenev's short story "The Diary of a Superfluous Man," won an Obie Award and starred a young Dustin Hoffman in the role of Zoditch.
Awards and fellowships.
In 1975, Ribman was honored by the Rockefeller Foundation with a Playwright-In-Residence fellowship for sustained contribution to American Theater.
Critical commentary and analysis.
After the American Repertory Theater's world premier of Ribman's "Sweet Table at the Richelieu," Jonathan Marks identified a central theme in Ribman's work as having "a preoccupation with the persistence of the past in the present—a recognition that we all carry with us a heavy baggage of seeds, each of which began sprouting at a different time in the past, and never stopped shooting out tendrils: a bag of memories which can never be simply dumped."

Francis P. Mulcahy

Francis Patrick Mulcahy (March 9, 1894 – December 11, 1973) was a general and commander in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. Mulcahy commanded the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, the Cactus Air Force, and the Tenth United States Army Tactical Air Force.
Military career.
Mulcahy, a native of Rochester, New York, graduated from Notre Dame University in 1914. In 1917, he was commissioned and attended naval flight school, becoming a naval aviator. Like Roy S. Geiger, Mulcahy flew bombing missions in France during World War I. He became one of the Marine Corps pioneers of close air support to ground operations during the inter-war years of expeditionary campaigns in the Caribbean and Central America.
At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mulcahy was serving as an observer with the British Western Desert Air Force in North Africa. He deployed to the Pacific in command of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. In the closing months of the Guadalcanal campaign, Mulcahy served in command of Allied Air Forces in the Solomon Islands, also known as the Cactus Air Force.
In August 1943, Mulcahy moved from Guadalcanal to New Georgia to command air units operating out of the newly captured airfield at Munda Point.
In September 1944, Mulcahy succeeded Major General Ross E. Rowell, USMC, as the Commanding General of Aircraft, Fleet Marine Force.
Mulcahy volunteered to lead the Tenth United States Army Tactical Air Force in the Invasion of Okinawa. He was deployed ashore early to the freshly captured air fields at Yontan and Kadena, and worked to coordinate the combat deployment of his joint-service aviators against the kamikaze threat to the fleet and in support of the Tenth Army in its protracted inland campaign. On June 11, 1945, he was relieved by Louis E. Woods because of poor health. Upon his retirement he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general.
He died on December 11, 1973.

Aravind Adiga

Aravind Adiga (born 23 October 1974) is an Indian writer and journalist. His debut novel, "The White Tiger", won the 2008 Man Booker Prize.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Aravind Adiga was born in Madras (now Chennai) on 23 October 1974 to Dr. K. Madhava Adiga and Usha Adiga, both of whom hailed from Mangalore. His paternal grandfather was the late K. Suryanarayana Adiga, former chairman of Karnataka bank while his maternal great-grandfather, U. Rama Rao, was a popular medical practitioner and Congress politician from Madras.
Adiga grew up in Mangalore and studied at Canara High School, then at St. Aloysius High School, where he completed his SSLC in 1990. He secured first rank in the state in SSLC. Incidentally his elder brother Anand Adiga secured 2nd rank in SSLC and first rank in PUC in the state.
After emigrating to Sydney, Australia, with his family, he studied at James Ruse Agricultural High School. He studied English literature at Columbia College, Columbia University, in New York, where he studied with Simon Schama and graduated as salutatorian in 1997. He also studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where one of his tutors was Hermione Lee.
Career.
Adiga began his journalistic career as a financial journalist, interning at the "Financial Times". With pieces published in the "Financial Times" and "Money", he covered the stock market and investment, interviewing, among others, Donald Trump. His review of previous Booker Prize winner Peter Carey's book, "Oscar and Lucinda", appeared in "The Second Circle", an online literary review.
He was subsequently hired by "TIME", where he remained a South Asia correspondent for three years before going freelance. During his freelance period, he wrote "The White Tiger". He currently lives in Mumbai, India.
Booker Prize.
Aravind Adiga's debut novel, "The White Tiger", won the 2008 Booker Prize. He is the fourth Indian-born author to win the prize, after Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy and Kiran Desai. (V. S. Naipaul, another winner, is of Indian origin, but was not born in India.) The five other authors on the shortlist included one other Indian writer (Amitav Ghosh) and another first-time writer (Steve Toltz). The novel studies the contrast between India's rise as a modern global economy and the lead character, Balram, who comes from crushing rural poverty.
He explained that "the criticism by writers like Flaubert, Balzac and Dickens of the 19th century helped England and France become better societies".
Shortly after winning the prize it was alleged that Adiga had, the previous year, sacked the agent that had secured his contract with Atlantic Books at the 2007 London Book Fair. In April 2009 it was announced that the novel would be adapted into a feature film. Propelled mainly by the Booker Prizer win, The White Tiger's Indian hardcover edition has sold in excess of 200,000 copies.
"Other Works".
Adiga's second book, "Between the Assassinations", was released in India in November 2008 and in the US and UK in mid-2009. The book features 12 interlinked short stories. His second novel and third published book, "Last Man in Tower", was published in the UK in 2011.

Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy

Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR) is a nonlinear infrared spectroscopy technique that has the ability to correlate vibrational modes in condensed-phase systems. This technique provides information beyond linear infrared spectra, by spreading the vibrational information along multiple axes, yielding a frequency correlation spectrum. A frequency correlation spectrum can offer structural information such as vibrational mode coupling, anharmonicities, along with chemical dynamics such as energy transfer rates and molecular dynamics with femtosecond time resolution. 2DIR experiments have only become possible with the development of ultrafast lasers and the ability to generate femtosecond infrared pulses.
Systems studied.
Among the many systems studied with infrared spectroscopy are water, metal carbonyls, short polypeptides, proteins, and DNA oligomers.
Experimental approaches.
There are two main approaches to two-dimensional spectroscopy, the Fourier-transform method, in which the data is collected in the time-domain and then Fourier-transformed to obtain a frequency-frequency 2D correlation spectrum, and the frequency domain approach in which all the data is collected directly in the frequency domain.
Time domain.
The time-domain approach consists of applying two pump pulses. The first pulse creates a coherence between the vibrational modes of the molecule and the second pulse creates a population, effectively storing information in the molecules. After a determined waiting time, ranging from a zero to a few hundred picoseconds, an interaction with a third pulse again creates a coherence, which, due to an oscillating dipole, radiates an infrared signal. The radiated signal is heterodyned with a reference pulse in order to retrieve frequency and phase information; the signal is usually collected in the frequency domain using a spectrometer yielding detection frequency formula_1. A two-dimensional Fourier-transform along formula_2 then yields a (formula_2, formula_1) correlation spectrum. In all these measurements phase stability among the pulses has to be preserved. Recently, pulse shaping approaches were developed to simplify overcoming this challenge.
Frequency domain.
Similarly, in the frequency-domain approach, a narrowband pump pulse is applied and, after a certain waiting time, then a broadband pulse probes the system. A 2DIR correlation spectrum is obtained by plotting the probe frequency spectrum at each pump frequency.
Spectral interpretation.
After the waiting time in the experiment, it is possible to reach doubly excited states. This results in the appearance of an overtone peak. The anharmonicity of a vibration can be read from the spectra as the distance between the diagonal peak and the overtone peak. One obvious advantage of 2DIR spectra over
normal linear absorption spectra is that they reveal the coupling between different states. This for example allows for the determination of the angle between the involved transition dipoles.
The true power of 2DIR spectroscopy is that it allows following dynamical processes such as chemical exchange, vibrational population transfer, and molecular reorientation on the sub-picosecond time scale. It has for example been used successfully to study hydrogen bond forming and breaking and to determine the transition state geometry of a structural rearrangement in an iron carbonyl compound. Spectral interpretation can be successfully assisted with developed theoretical methods.
Currently two freely available packages exists for modelling 2D IR spectra. These are the SPECTRON developed by the Mukamel group (University of California, Irvine) and the NISE program developed by the Jansen group (University of Groningen).
Solvent effect.
The consideration of the solvent effect has been shown to be crucial in order to effectively describe the vibrational coupling in solution, since the solvent modify both vibrational frequencies, transition probabilities and couplings. Computer simulations can reveal the spectral signatures arising from solvent degrees of freedom and their change upon water reorganization.

Plot.
In colonial England, under a certain amount of duress, Jack takes on a job which will not only cause him a great deal of trouble, but also bring to light the answer to a mystery out of his distant past. A lack of money leads Jack to accept a charter to take a British secret agent to mysterious Tooth Island. When Jack's ship shatters on the mysterious island's cliffs on arrival and the secret agent quickly becomes a meal for a monster in the jungle, Jack is soon left to cope with the situation on his own. Players interact with dozens of characters and use more than 250 found objects to solve puzzles, as Jack moves closer to solving the mystery of his past and how it ties in with the present.

Áed Rón mac Cathail (died 604) was a king of the Uí Failge, a Laigin people of County Offaly. He was the grandson of Bruidge mac Nath Í (died 579), a previous king.
He is listed as king in the "Book of Leinster" king list though incorrectly as "Aed Róin mac Falge Ruit". He is also mentioned in a poem in the genealogies about the royal fort at Rathangan, County Kildare. His father Cathal mac Bruidgi was also mentioned as king in this poem but is not in the king list or annals.
Áed took the side of the Síl nÁedo Sláine branch versus the Clann Cholmáin in the feud among the southern Ui Neill. As a result he was slain in 604 on the same day as Áed Sláine in the interests of Conall Guthbinn (died 635), king of Uisnech.
His son Ailill mac Áedo Róin was a king of the Uí Failge. However future kings were to descend from his brother Máel Uma.

(-)-2β-(1,2,4-Oxadiazol-5-methyl)-3β-phenyltropane

RTI-126 ((–)-2β-(1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-methyl)-3β-phenyltropane) is a phenyltropane derivative which acts as a potent monoamine reuptake inhibitor and stimulant drug. It is around 5 times more potent a stimulant than cocaine, but is relatively unselective. It binds to all three monoamine transporters, although still with some selectivity for the dopamine transporter. RTI-126 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its pharmacological profile in animals is among the closest to cocaine itself out of all the drugs in the RTI series. Its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with its rapid entry into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals.
The structurally related compound (–)-2β-(3-methyl-5-isoxazolyl)nortropane is a potent and selective agonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with twice the potency of nicotine.

Dogtrot house

The dogtrot, also known as a breezeway house, dog-run, or possum-trot, is a style of house that was common throughout the Southeastern United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Most theories place its origins in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Some scholars believe the style developed in the post-Revolution frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee. Others note its presence as far east as the Piedmont of the Carolinas from an early period.
Architects continue to build dogtrot houses using modern materials but maintaining the original design.
Design.
A dogtrot house historically consisted of two log cabins connected by a breezeway or "dogtrot", all under a common roof. Typically one cabin was used for cooking and dining while the other was used as a private living space, such as a bedroom. The primary characteristics of a dogtrot house is that it is typically one or 1½-stories, has at least two rooms averaging between wide that each flank an open-ended central hall. Additional rooms usually take the form of a semidetached ell or shed rooms, flanking the hall to the front or rear.
The breezeway through the center of the house is a unique feature, with rooms of the house opening into the breezeway. The breezeway provided a cooler covered area for sitting. The combination of the breezeway and open windows in the rooms of the house created air currents which pulled cooler outside air into the living quarters efficiently in the pre-air conditioning era. 
Secondary characteristics of the dogtrot house includes placement of the chimneys, staircases, and porches. Chimneys were almost always located at each gable end of the house, with each serving one of the two main rooms. If the house was 1½ or the rarer two stories, the necessary staircase was usually at least partially enclosed or boxed in. The stairway was most commonly placed in one or both of the main rooms, although it was sometimes placed in the open hallway. Although some houses had only the open central hall and flanking rooms, most dogtrots had full-width porches to the front and/or rear.
Surviving homes.
The town of Dubach in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, has several surviving dogtrot houses. In 1990, it was nicknamed the "Dogtrot Capital of the World" by the Louisiana State Legislature.
The estate known as "Ranch Azalee" in south Webster Parish in north Louisiana, formerly owned by the late State Senator Harold Montgomery, was originally of dogtrot design, having begun ca. 1840 as the James Jackson Bryan House. In 1999, Ranch Azalee was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Near Nashville, Arkansas, the Noel Owen Neal House was built in 1840. Neal, a farmer, died in 1850. His wife, Hesky, maintained the farm after his death. The house has been moved to Washington, Arkansas, and has undergone restoration, to include the replacing of the roof, porches, and chimneys.

Intersubjective psychoanalysis

The term "intersubjectivity" was introduced to psychoanalysis by George E. Atwood and Robert Stolorow (1984), although this philosophical concept dates back to "German Idealism".
The myth of isolated mind.
Trends in intersubjective psychoanalysis have accused traditional or classical psychoanalysis of having described psychic phenomena as "the myth of isolated mind". Psychoanalyst and philosopher Jon Mills, has criticized this accusation as a misinterpretation of Freudian theory.
Key figures.

Postage stamps and postal history of Korea

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Korea.
Before a strict isolationist country, Korea began to open up in the second half of the 19th century.
Stamps of Joseon dynasty.
Joseon issued its own first stamps on 18 November 1884 when the first postal service was created. While five values were printed - 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mon, only the 5m and 10m values were issued, and even these saw little use, as the post office was burned down during a revolt in December 1884.
The next series of stamps did not appear until 1895, and consisted of four values: 5, 10, 25, and 50 poon, all of the same design featuring a taegeuk symbol. They were overprinted "Dae Han" in 1897, and surcharged to 1 poon in 1900.
Stamps of Korean Empire.
A currency change in 1900, to rin, cheun, and weun, necessitated new stamps, and accordingly a series of 13 was issued, with values ranging from 2 rin to 2 weun. While all the designs have a common theme of the taegeuk symbol, the frames are different for each value, and the three highest values are printed in two colors each. In 1902 five of these were surcharged using black handstamps.
Korea issued its first commemorative stamp on 18 October 1902, marking the 40th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Gojong. The orange stamp depicted the emperor's crown. The last stamps of the Empire were another series of 13 issued in 1910, with all stamps of a common depicting a falcon symbol.
However, in 1910, Japan assumed administrative control of Korean Empire, and subsequently all mail used Japanese Chosēn stamps. This state of affairs continued until early 1945 after liberation.

&quot;Awesome&quot;

"Awesome" (the quotation marks are part of the name) are a Seattle-based septet with roots in cabaret and theater, self-described as "Part band, part art collective." While they reject the "rock band" label, Lane Czaplinski, artistic director of On the Boards remarks, "If they are not rock musicians, "there is rock payoff." Czaplinski has compared them to Polyphonic Spree and Scissor Sisters.
"Awesome Dan" began as a cabaret act thrown together by seven experienced fringe theater actors. Although they continued to perform often in theatrical venues, their identity as a band and cabaret act has eclipsed their status as actors. Around October 2003, several future members of "Awesome" played together in a They Might Be Giants tribute to raise money for Seattle's Open Circle Theater. Their very first performance under the name "Awesome" (with just Ackermann, Mosher, Nixon, and Osebold) was in Seattle at Annex Theater's monthly cabaret "Spin the Bottle" On February 6, 2004, and their first full-septet performance as "Awesome" was in the Jewelbox theater at Belltown bar the Rendezvous on June 30, 2004. Their first major production was "Delaware" (first a multi-media stage production and later an album). Gigs as a band have included performing on bills with Harvey Danger, A. C. Newman, U.S.E., The Presidents of the United States of America, and The Long Winters.
Band member David Nixon is a philosophy professor at the University of Washington, Bothell.
Band member Rob Witmer (accordion, clarinet) is a composer and sound designer for theater productions.
Many of the group's theatrical pieces are non-narrative or have only minimal, non-linear narratives. For example, "noSIGNAL" (2006) was described by "Seattle Times" reviewer Brangien Davis as "addressing, among other topics, technical difficulties, recurring dreams, cell death, regeneration and bees."

Malibu, British Columbia

Malibu is a locality in British Columbia's Sunshine Coast district. This place may also be referred to as Malibu Islet and Malibu Rapids. This was the site of the Malibu Club, formerly a private resort which is today a Christian youth camp.
Malibu is at the mouth of the Princess Louisa Inlet and Swaywelat Sechelt Bands 12 and 12A. It is only accessible by boat or by seaplane.
History.
Thomas F. Hamilton began construction of the Malibu Club in 1940, named after his yacht, the "MV Malibu". This was the first of a planned series of resorts throughout Princess Louisa Inlet. The club opened in July 1941, but its operations were suspended until the end of World War II in 1945. From that point until 1950, the facility was open as a premium resort. Visitors included John Wayne, Senator John F. Kennedy, Barbara Stanwyck, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope. The club faced financial problems due to the limited transportation access and the limited two-month window of good weather. In 1948, a polio death and related quarantine further damaged business prospects. Hamilton's Malibu Club was closed in 1950.
Young Life, a Christian association, agreed to purchase the facilities from Hamilton in December 1953 and has operated the Malibu Club facility since. Hamilton had put a $1,000,000 price tag on the property, but sold it to Jim Rayburn, the founder of Young Life, for $300,000 after visiting other Young Life camps in the area.

Michipicoten Island is an island in Ontario, Canada, in the northeastern part of Lake Superior, approximately 175 km (109 mi) northwest of Sault Ste. Marie and 65 km (40 mi) southwest of Wawa, Ontario.[http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/11000/246085.pdf] It falls within the boundaries of Thunder Bay District, Ontario, not Algoma District.
The third largest island in Lake Superior Michipicoten Island is 27 km (17 mi) long and ten km (6 mi) wide at its widest point. Uninhabited by humans and with plentiful wildlife (notably beaver, woodland caribou, and birds), it has become a destination for some adventurous kayakers. At its closest point to mainland Ontario, the island is located about 16 km (10 mi) from land.[http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/11000/246085.pdf
The entire island is administered by Ontario Parks as Michipicoten Island Provincial Park. The island is made up of ancient lava bedrock related to volcanism of the Midcontinent Rift System[http://nhic.mnr.gov.on.ca/areas/areas_report.cfm?areaid=3140] and is heavily forested, with several inland lakes.
A lighthouse was established in 1912 on the eastern end of the island.
On some old maps, Michipicoten Island is shown as Isle Maurepas, after the French minister of Marine Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas.

Vittorio Fiorucci (1932 – July 30, 2008) was an Italian Canadian poster artist from Montreal, Canada.
Fiorucci was born on 2 November 1932 in Zara (Italy). During World War Two when Zara was about to be captured by Yugoslavia, Fiorucci and his family fled to Venice, Italy, where he subsequently spent most of his childhood before coming to Canada in 1951. By 1960, he was an established artist and by 1980 was one of the most renowned poster designers in the world. Fiorucci was awarded a Moebius Award at the 1998 International Advertising Awards of Chicago, and lifetime achievement awards from the Canadian Association of Photographers and Illustrators and the Institute of Design Montréal. Fiorucci worked in a variety of mediums: he did illustration works for magazines (including the film magazine Take One), children's books, animation, and was an established photographer who was exhibited in 1958 at George Eastman House's International Exhibition of the World's Greatest Photographers.
His work was used to promote many of the films that marked the beginning of independent Québécois cinema, and appeared in magazines as varied as "Time" and (the cinema magazine) Take One. He created the logo for the Le Château chain of clothing stores, and the green mascot Victor of the Just For Laughs festival. He died from a stroke on July 30, 2008.

Alun-alun

Alun-alun (note: correct orthography hyphenated but occurs occasionally without, also found as "aloen-aloen", "aloon aloon", and erroneously "alon-alon") is a Javanese architectural term for the large central open lawn squares common to villages, towns and cities in Indonesia.
Commonly, "alun-alun" in modern-day Indonesia refers only to the two large open squares of kraton palace compounds.
Each kraton has two "alun-alun": the most important and northern "alun-alun lor" and the less important and commonly smaller southern "alun-alun kidul". The court of Pakubuwana in Surakarta is unique as it incorporates the "alun-alun kidul" within the defensive wall of the kraton proper.
Function.
The northern "alun-alun lor" functioned as the primary and most official entrance to the kraton.
Javanese officials and commoners alike had to dismount carriages and horses before entering the "alun-alun lor" to continue to the kraton. At the two centrally located holy "beringin" or banyan trees, officials had their "payung" (ceremonial parasols indicating office), placed down by their parasol valet.
Ordinary commoner Javanese seeking an audience with the Regent would be required to sit and wait under the trees waiting for an official to leave the Kraton and ask their reason for an audience.
Dutch officials such as the Resident were commonly received with great ceremony to the "alun-alun lor" with the kraton soldiers firing three volleys, which would be answered by a twenty-one gun salute from the Dutch fortress, especially between the Yogyakarta kraton and the Dutch Fort Vredeburg
Architectural convention.
Strict rules govern the location of buildings surrounding the "alun-alun lor". The main mosque must be cited on the west side and hence correctly face east (to Mecca). The official residence of the Regent's ""Patih"", also "Bupati" (town or village head) was situated on the North or South. East is generally reserved for shops, markets, or houses of prominent families.
Two enormous "Pacikra" or "Pacikeran" doors conventionally separate the high defensive perimeter wall surrounding the kraton and the "alun-alun".
The "gladak" or "pradah" compound for stables, porters and draught horses was stationed outside the north gate of the "alun-alun", presumably for practicality for disembarking officials and to keep the smell of horses and manure as far as possible from the kraton.
Historical Function.
The "alun-alun lor" also historically functioned for a place for public corporal punishments and executions. Condemned criminals were publicly executed by "krissing" (using a keris to stab the condemned from the left shoulder blade downward into the heart) beside the enclosed banyan trees of the "alun-alun lor". For especially heinous criminals, most especially traitors and vicious brigands the condemned's head would be impaled on a pike as a macabre public warning 
The "alun-alun lor" functioned and continues to function as centre for public spectacles, court celebrations and general non-court entertainment. The Javanese festivals of "Garebeganan" and "Sekaten" great fairs were held here, as they are still held today, with the spectacle of huge mountains of rice exiting the kraton for blessings at the mosque and distributed to the people in the "alun-alun lor". 
Occasionally a social and entertainment spectacle of a tiger and buffalo fight wold be held, though from Sultan Hamengkubawana VII onward these were rare, as the Yogyakarta court tigers were incredibly useful for public sanitation as they were fed a diet of stray dogs.
The "alun-alun lor" was the only place where the Sultan would conduct dialogue with his people, and functioned to show his humanity and humility.
The "alun-lun kidul" was more of a generic ground, principally for everyday mustering troops or servants and for exiting officials, servants and workers attending to mundane everyday business.
Contemporary Function.
In modern-day Yogyakarta, the "alun-alun lor" is now surrounded by shops and malls, frequently holding micro-business stalls and for youngsters to picnic on the grounds and consume their recently purchased take-away (take-out) food.
The Yogyakarta kraton "alun-alun kidul" has two banyan trees in the centre famed, according to local folklore, to bring good luck to skillful enough to navigate their way between them without mishap, blindfolded and today on Friday and Saturday nights, youngsters boisterously pursue this fabled luck.
Alon-alon errata.
The transliteration of ""alon alon"" is erroneous Javanese. Possibly the accent of the Javanese speaker confused the scribe.
The definition of "alon alon" is to progress slowly or cautiously, and well-known within the modern Indonesian public sphere as the phrase ""alon alon asal kelakon"": "slowly and surely as long as it's task done"- humorously amended to the very popular contemporary ""alon alon asal kelakson"": "slowly as long as you beep the horn" referencing Jakarta's infamous gridlock traffic.

Manuel Pascali

Manuel Pascali (born 9 September 1981 in Milan, Italy) is an Italian professional footballer who plays for Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock.
Club career.
He started his career with Sant'Angelo before moving on to Serie C2 with Pizzighettone and Carpenedolo. He then earned a move to Serie A with Parma in 2007, although he was loaned out to Foligno of Serie C1/A for the entire 2007–08 season.
Kilmarnock.
He initially joined Kilmarnock on trial in July 2008 with a view to a one-year loan deal. During this period however, his performances convinced manager Jim Jefferies to part with an undisclosed fee to acquire him on a three-year deal. Upon joining Kilmarnock, Pascali revealed that Sergio Porrini played a role of Pascali joining a Scottish club and says he might be successful there Scotland, which he did later on in his Kilmarnock's career. On 9 August 2008, Pascali made his debut for the club in a 1–0 win over Hibernian. On 23 August 2008, Pascali scored his first goal for the club in the 45th minute in a 1–0 win over Hamilton Academical. His second goal came on 15 December 2008 in a 2–0 win over Motherwell. On 13 January 2009, Pascali provided an assist to an Allan Russell goal in a 2–1 defeat by Aberdeen. In his first season, Pascali made 35 appearances in all competitions and scored 3 goals (2 in the league and 1 in the Scottish Cup against Ayr United in a 2–2 draw on 10 January 2009).
Pascali started the 2009–10 season with a win in the 3–1 triumph over Morton in the League Cup after coming on as a substitute early in the second half. He played his first league match of the season in a 3–1 win over St. Mirren on 29 August. He was sent off in the league match against Rangers on 19 September, after a second bookable offence in a 0–0 draw. On 18 January 2010, Pascali scored his first of the season in a 1–0 win over Falkirk to advance Kilmarnock to the fifth round of the Scottish Cup. On 30 January 2010, Pascali scored his second of the season in a thrilling 4–4 draw against Dundee United. In his second season, Pascali made 26 appearances in total and scored 2 goals, 1 in the league and 1 in the Scottish Cup.
Pascali played in the first league match of the 2010–11 season, a 2–1 defeat by Rangers. On 10 November 2010, Pascali provided an assist to Conor Sammon in a 3–0 win over Hamilton, his first in almost two years. On 19 March 2011, Pascali scored his first goal of the season and also provided the assist for Jamie Hamill to score the second goal in a 3–1 win over Motherwell. On 23 April, Pascali scored a header in the 87th minute in a 4–2 defeat against Dundee United. Pascali provided an assist for James Fowler in his next game on 30 April against Hearts in a 2–2 draw. Pascali received 3 one-match bans after he received 18 yellow cards over the course of the season. Pascali featured 39 times and scored twice.
At the start of the season, Pascali started the 2011–12 campaign with a 1–1 draw against Dundee United on 24 July 2011 and soon became a temporary skipper for the club. After a match against Rangers on 27 September 2011, which Kilmarnock lost 2–0, Pascali was involved in an altercation in the tunnel with Rangers defender Steven Whittaker which Rangers' manager Ally McCoist dismissed as 'handbags' and "like two boys in the playground" in his post-match press conference. Manager Kenny Shiels wanted an end to the row that developed between Kirk Broadfoot and Pascali and referred to Broadfoot as "the ugly boy from Rangers" and "the male model from Ayrshire" in a radio interview. However, Broadfoot claimed Pascali made death threats and was "in my face saying he was going to kill me". In response to this, Pascali denied the his claim and branded Broadfoot a publicity-seeking coward. 4 days after the incident on 1 October 2011, Pascali scored his first of the season in a 2–1 defeat by St. Johnstone. On 19 November 2011, Pascali scored his second goal of the season in a 1–1 draw against Hibernian.
On 27 November, Pascali scored the winning goal for Kilmarnock in a 1–0 win at Rugby Park against Rangers in the Scottish Premier League. Following his goal against Rangers, Pascali spoke to BBC Scotland's Chick Young and said scoring against Rangers was the best day of his career. On 7 January 2012, Pascali scored the only goal for Kilmarnock in a 1–1 draw against Dundee in the Scottish Cup.
In February 2012, Pascali broke his leg while stretching for the ball during training. He spent the rest of the 2011–12 season on the sidelines. He ended the season with 30 appearances and 4 goals (3 in the league and 1 in the Scottish Cup). During his rehabilitation, Pascali signed a new deal with Kilmarnock. He penned a three-year contract and manager Shiels described Pascali as "one of the three quartermasters" along with Garry Hay and James Fowler. 
Pascali made his first appearance since his leg injury in a 0–0 draw against Dundee in the opening game of the 2012–13 season on 4 August. Pascali then started Kilmarnock's next match, away to Inverness Caledonian Thistle and scored his first goal of the new campaign in a 1–1 draw. On 24 November, Pascali received a straight red card in the fifth minute after a foul on Nigel Hasselbaink in a 2–1 defeat by St. Johnstone. His sending off was criticised by Kenny Shiels and after the match the club appealed the red card. However, the appeal was unsuccessful meaning Pascali would miss two matches. St. Johnstone manager Steve Lomas spoke out about the sending off insisting the Kilmarnock supporters were wrong to jeer Hasselbaink after the winger was made the scapegoat by the home crowd. After the two match ban, Pascali returned to the squad in a 2–0 win over Aberdeen. On 19 January 2013, Pascali scored two goals in the 3–2 defeat by Dundee United. However the following month, Pascali suffered an hamstring injury during a match against Hearts, which he went off on the 75th minutes and will cause him to miss the rest of the season, like last season.
Personal life.
He married his wife, Chiara, and has a son, Francesco (born in 2009). After four years since joining Kilmarnock, Pascali says he never expected in Scotland for a long time and feel native living there .

The village has a population of 205.
The parish was founded and the church built in 1511 by Mikołaj Radziwiłł, voivode of Vilnius. Its funding was increased by King Sigismund II Augustus. The church in Kalinówka was under the patronage of Saint Anne. A new church was built, perhaps around the middle of the 16th century, and the old one was transported to Brzozowa, which was a branch of the Kalinówka church. On 17 August 1761 the church in Kalinówka burned down, along with the archive and rectory. It was rebuilt anew of larch wood, thanks to the efforts of Rev. Adam Świerzbiński, pastor in Kalinówka, canon of Inflanty. The construction undoubtedly lasted several years and was finished in 1776. This church was consecrated on 5 October 1777 by Brześć (of Łuck diocese) suffragan bishop Jan Szyjkowski. This church has survived to modern times and continues to serve the faithful.
At that same time, that is, around 1774, a new rectory was built as well as other pastoral buildings, including a storeroom that has survived to our day and is registered as a monument relic. The rectory from that time, on the other hand, was taken apart after a new one was built of brick and stone, in the days of pastor Rev. Antoni Kruk in the 1980s.

Minebea PM-9

The Minebea PM-9 Submachine Gun, known officially in the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) as the or as the M9, is a Japanese-made machine pistol. Based on the Israeli IMI Mini-Uzi, the PM-9 has the same telescoping bolt as the Mini-Uzi, but differs in its appearance, operational use and handling.
The JSDF uses the PM9 as its official submachine gun, although some of its special forces units now use other weapons. The 1st Airborne Brigade and the Western Army Infantry Regiment are the only special forces units in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) known to be armed with the PM-9 as the brigade's main submachine gun. The PM-9 is reported to be in use in the JGSDF's Special Forces Group. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) uses it when conducting base security.
History.
The PM-9 is produced by the Nippon Miniature Bearing Company, otherwise known as Minebea. The design is based mainly on the Mini-Uzi submachine gun. It was adopted in 1999 for non-frontline forces such as vehicle drivers, artillery personnel, some of its special forces units, and some commissioned officers who were given priority for better equipment.
Though it has been the official submachine gun for more than a decade, JSDF officials are looking at a possible replacement, as it is planned to phase it out in the near future. One possible replacement is the Heckler & Koch MP5. JSDF troops assigned to guard duty on both Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and JASDF garrison bases had their PM-9s replaced with other high-performing submachine guns, and the JGSDF will also eventually replace the PM-9.
Features.
The PM-9 differs in appearance from its Israeli counterpart in a few ways. A foregrip is mounted underneath the barrel of the PM-9 to aid fully automatic firing with a flash suppressor in place. The weapon can also be modified to have a foldable stock, a detachable suppressor and a mounted reflex sight, though these modifications are most unlikely to be used in peacekeeping operations abroad, since such activities do not involve Japanese soldiers in combat situations. The initial batches of PM-9s were first made with wooden pistol and foregrips, before they switched to use plastic grips on the current PM-9s in JSDF service.
Adoption.
There were some questions as to why the PM-9 was only adopted for JSDF use a decade ago, though the following were said to be reasons:
Although these reasons are quite valid, it was said that the reason why the PM-9 was adopted as the JSDF's main submachine gun is because of the high costs that would arise if they were to select the Heckler & Koch MP5 instead.

Kitty from Kansas City

Kitty from Kansas City was a 1930 song, famously sung by Hubert Prior Vallée, a French Vermont singer, popularly called Rudy Vallée. The song is about a Midwestern girl called Kitty and her apparent lack of intelligence, and obesity, due to a lyric: "She wasn't hard to see; she weighed 243."
Some recordings have been made by Vallée, the Imperial Dance Orchestra, and Johnny Walker.
Animated Film.
Kitty from Kansas City was the 47th part of the Screen Songs series. It includes an early (although very identical) version of Betty Boop. The title card music is a lyrical variation of the song "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile".
Kitty (Betty) was walking to a Kansas City train station, and she waited for her train to “Rudy Valley”, a place where her friend (Rudy) lives. As she waited, the train’s mail compartment sign snatches her. A mouse writes “Fe” behind mail, as a parody of the word “female”.
She reaches “Rudy Valley”, where the cartoon changes to a live-action performance of Vallée and his “Connecticut Yankees” singing and playing the song. Then, the scene goes back to the cartoon, where Kitty does some of the antics in the lyrics, the film ending with Kitty unpluggin a water stopping cork in a pond, with a parade of marine creature following Kitty.
The live-action performance (and the second cartoon sequence) have the pre-recorded soundtrack off, by about a second and a half.

2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship

The 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship was the first edition of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship, after the previous Under-18 competition was reclassified. The tournament was held in Norway, between 21 July and 28 July 2002. The top three teams from each group qualified for the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Players born on or after 1 January 1983 were eligible to participate in this competition.
The final tournament took place in seven venues located in seven cities — Bærum, Drammen, Hønefoss, Kongsvinger, Lillestrøm, Moss and Oslo. The winners were Spain, who beat Germany to secure their fourth title, and the top scorer was Fernando Torres, with four goals. This edition is also notable for Nelly Viennot becoming the first female official who participated in an UEFA-organised men's football event, after acting as assistant referee at Norway's 1–5 defeat of Slovakia on 21 July 2002.
Qualification.
The qualification format consisted of two rounds. In the preliminary round, which took place between August and November 2001, 50 national teams were drawn into 14 groups (six groups of three teams and eight groups of four teams) contested as round-robin mini-tournaments hosted by one of the group teams. The group winners then progressed to the intermediary round, where they were paired and played two-legged ties between March and May 2002. The winners secured qualification for the final tournament, joining Norway who qualified automatically as hosts.

50 metre rifle prone

50 metre rifle prone is an International Shooting Sport Federation event consisting of 60 shots from the prone position with a .22 Long Rifle (5.6 mm) caliber rifle. The time limit is 75 minutes for the entire match including sighting shots, or 90 minutes if there is a need to compensate for slow scoring systems.
The sport is based on the traditional "English Match" that also consisted of 60 shots in the prone position with a .22 rifle, but had varying distances between and .
Only the men's event is included on the Olympic program and thus includes a final for the top eight competitors, where the score zones are divided into tenths, giving up to 10.9 points for each shot. The final consists of ten shots, with a time limit of 45 seconds per shot. The competition is won by the shooter who reaches the highest aggregate score (qualification + final, maximum 709.0).
The women's event is not Olympic but included in both the ISSF and the CISM World Championships. As there is no final, shooters with the same score are separated by a number of tie-breaking criteria, the first being the number of inner tens. Women's rifles may weigh up to , as opposed to for men, but after the switch from "standard rifles" to "sport rifles" this is now the only difference in equipment.

50 metre rifle three positions

50 metre rifle three positions is an International Shooting Sport Federation event, a miniature version of 300 metre rifle three positions. It consists of the prone, standing and kneeling positions, fired in that order, with 3×40 shots for men and 3×20 shots for women. The caliber is .22 Long Rifle (5.6 mm).
The men's match has separate commands and times for each position, giving each shooter 45 minutes to complete the prone part, 75 minutes for the standing part, and 60 minutes for the kneeling part, including sighting shots for each part. The women's match has an overall maximum time of 2 hours and 15 minutes. Slightly longer times are used if there is a need to compensate for slow scoring systems. Women's rifles may weigh up to , as opposed to for men, but after the switch from "standard rifles" to "sport rifles" this is now the only difference in equipment.
The top eight competitors reach the final, where the score zones are divided into tenths, giving up to 10.9 points for each shot. Both the men's and the women's final consists of ten shots from the standing position, with a time limit of 75 seconds per shot. The competition is won by the shooter who reaches the highest aggregate score (qualification + final, maximum 1309.0 for men, 709.0 for women).

Floats (drink)

Floats are a beverage line introduced by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in January 2008. Two flavors are available, A&W Float and Sunkist Float. The purpose of the concept is to mimic the flavor of an ice cream float of a given soda. Thus, the A&W flavor is intended to taste like a root beer float, while the latter is comparable to an orange creamsicle or Sunkist float.
The drinks are creamy in nature and contain little carbonation, and no caffeine. Ingredients include skim milk, cream, and nitrous oxide to create foam. While it is recommended that they be served chilled, refrigeration of Floats is not mandatory. Available in 11.5-ounce, vintage soda-shop-inspired glass bottles with twist-off tops, Floats are sold at major US retail, grocery, and convenience stores.
Marketing.
The product's first press release was issued on January 2, 2008, which included bottle design photos, suggested retail prices, and other information. 
In the press release, Andrew Springate, vice president of marketing, stated:
Reception.
According to Cadbury Schweppes, "the Floats concept was one of the highest scoring product ideas from our Discovery Innovation Group. This group is challenged to find and create new ideas across our brand portfolio."

Járngreipr

In Norse mythology, Járngreipr (Old Norse "iron grippers") or Járnglófar ("iron gauntlets") are the iron gloves of the god Thor. According to the "Prose Edda", along with the hammer Mjölnir and the belt Megingjörð, Járngreipr is one of Thor's three crucial possessions. According to chapter 20 of the book "Gylfaginning", he requires the gloves to handle his powerful hammer. The reason for this may come from the forging of the hammer, when the dwarf working the bellows was bitten in his eye by a gadfly (commonly held to be Loki in disguise) which caused the handle of the hammer to be shortened.

Henry Swift (photographer)

Henry Swift (1891, Berkeley, California – 1962, Berkeley, California) was an American photographer and member of the famous Group f/64.
In the early 1920s he met photographer Edward Weston by chance in Carmel, California and began making photographs as a hobby. He was earning a living as a stockbroker, a career he continued throughout his life. In 1932 he became a founding member of Group f/64 along with Weston, Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham and several others. Later that year he showed nine prints (the same number as Weston) in the landmark Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. While participating in the group, he was also able to collect many of the other photographers prints because of earnings as a stockbroker. Cunningham recalls that Swift bought all of the prints from the first show, which, if he paid the listed price for each photo, would have cost him a grand total of $845 for 80 prints.
After Group f/64 dissolved in 1935, Swift's interest in photography waned. He is not known to have exhibited again. When he died in 1962, his widow Florence Swift assembled his collection of photographs from members of Group f/64, sought additional donations from some of the original members of the group, and donated the entire collection to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

History.
The idea for the school materialized in 1993. The school was founded in 1996 by Kris McClung and had 60 students when it opened it doors in 1996. In 2007, CoSA unveiled a $12 million theater arts complex that includes a 650-seat main-stage theater, a black-box theater, scene shop, music and drama rooms, administrative offices, and a fly loft.
In 2005, four evacuees of Hurricane Katrina relocated from the wind and rain damaged New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.

Orchard Road (song)

"Orchard Road" is a song recorded by Leo Sayer for his album "Have You Ever Been in Love".
The song made number 16 on the UK Singles Chart in 1983.
Its music was composed by Alan Tarney with the lyrics by Leo Sayer.
Misconception.
It is thought by some that the song title refers to the famous retail and entertainment hub of Orchard Road in Singapore, and the cover artwork of a 12" release featuring the song depicts Orchard Road scenery. However, according to Sayer, the lyrics to the song are based on an all-night phone conversation out in a public telephone booth he had with his then wife, pleading for her return from her flat and forgiveness after a lapse of judgement in their 7-year marital life. The song title is a made-up road name. Orchard Road in reality, refers to Churchfield Road, Acton in Greater London where his ex-wife Janice had moved out to.

Blackbird (band)

Formed by brothers Chip and Tony Kinman after they dissolved their cowpunk band Rank and File, Blackbird were an electronic post-punk band. The Kinman's harmony-enhanced singing was as mellifluous as the vocal sound they had established in Rank and File, while the songwriting structure was pop music-inspired. The pop elements were anchored by a grungy-sounding Yamaha RX-5 drum machine, Tony's throbbing 8th-note bass lines and thickened by Chip's heavily distorted and echo-y guitar lines.
Blackbird marked the third distinct musical style embraced and perpetrated by the Kinmans, first with punk rock (The Dils), followed by country punk (or cowpunk) with Rank and File, and finally the abrasive, metallic techno-pop of Blackbird.
The band's oeuvre includes three eponymous albums, the first two released by Iloki Records and produced by then-Butthole Surfers sound tech, Ric Wallace. Subsequent releases include the last album (also eponymous) released on Scotti Bros. in 1992; following the third and final full-length release, Iloki Records hired Braindead Soundmachine's Cole Coonce to produce updated versions of songs the brothers had success with in previous bands, "Class War" by The Dils and "Amanda Ruth" by Rank and File.
Post-breakup.
The Kinmans' next project was the acoustic guitar-driven campfire music act Cowboy Nation. Following the dissolution of Cowboy Nation, the brothers returned to their punk rock roots, albeit separately; Chip established the punk rock act Pacific Coast Highway, while Tony created the punk-pop trio Los Trendy.

Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania

Tobyhanna is an unincorporated community in Coolbaugh Township in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, United States. Despite its name, it is not located in Tobyhanna Township.
History.
"Tobyahanna" is derived from an American Indian word meaing Toby-"Dark Water"Hanna-"a stream whose banks are fringed with alder."
From about 1900 to 1936, Tobyhanna lakes were the site of active ice industries. The ice was cut from the lakes during the winter and stored in large barn-like structures. During the rest of the year, the ice was added to railroad boxcars hauling fresh produce and meats destined for East Coast cities.
In 1912, Tobyhanna had a railway station, telegraph, and post office. The federal government acquired land within Tobyhanna that became the Tobyhanna Military Reservation, later Tobyhanna Army Depot, which was used as an Artillery training ground. Edward B. Reed, in "The Field Artillery Journal" (January–March 1917), described Tobyhanna based on his experiences with the Yale Batteries during their training:
""The camp at Tobyhanna is on a rocky, treeless crest from which no trace of man is visible. About are mountains and uncultivated valleys. The village of Tobyhanna is interesting only because it contains a station that enables you to leave it. No better place for work could be found.""
In recent years, due to its location between the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and development of new homes, many families have moved to the Poconos. Some Tobyhanna residents choose to commute to the city via Interstate 380, Interstate 80, or Interstate 84.
Geography.
The landscape of the area is of broad, flat areas intermixed with low hills covered with a northern hardwood forest. Common tree species are beech, birch, and maple.
Education.
Two schools are located with Tobyhanna: the Coolbaugh Learning Center (CLC) and the Coolbaugh Elementary Center (CEC). The schools educate children through 4th Grade. Tobyhanna schools are part of the Pocono Mountain School District.

<doc id="18656491" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18656491" title="Mei no Naisho">
Mei no Naisho

, subtitled "make miracle", is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Shiroi Kusaka. The story centers on an effeminate high school boy named Mei Haruna who was raised as a girl by his now-deceased witch mother; Mei too can use magic, though he is not proficient at it. After his mother's death, he transfers to an all-girls school and resides in the school's dormitory with his roommate, and public morals committee member, Fūka Honjō. "Mei no Naisho" began serialization in Fujimi Shobo's shōnen manga magazine "Dragon Age Pure" on October 20, 2007, and was later transferred to Fujimi Shobo's "Monthly Dragon Age" starting with the June 2009 issue. Two bound volumes have been released in Japan.
Plot.
"Mei no Naisho" revolves around the life of the title character Mei Haruna, an effeminate young boy who was raised by his witch mother as a girl, and always thought of himself as female. The reason for this stems half in part from his mother being aware that men born into a magical lineage typically live shorter lives than women born into these families. However, if a male is raised as a female, this will prove effective in ensuring him a long life. The other half had to do with his mother having enjoyed dressing up her son in female clothing and taking photographs of him as her hobby, though Mei is not aware of this half of the reason for his upbringing. His mother was the only family he had, so after she died, he transfers to an all-girls high school and comes to reside in the school's dormitory with his talking familiar cat Abel, and his roommate Fūka Honjō, who is also a member of the public morals committee.
Shortly after arriving at the school, his new friends discover after a magical display in the dormitory community bath that he is actually male, though this comes as quite a shock to him despite him being aware of the physical differences between him and normal girls. Despite him being found out, and after some helpful intervening of the perverted student council president, the principal of the school decides that he can stay at the school. The next day, Mei comes to school with Fūka and apologizes for hiding the fact that he was a witch, and informs the others how he is apparently male. The other students quickly accept him as one of their own, and are impressed how he can use magic.
Manga.
The "Mei no Naisho" manga series, written and illustrated by Shiori Kusaka, was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's shōnen manga magazine "Dragon Age Pure" between October 20, 2007 and December 19, 2008. After "Dragon Age Pure" was discontinued in early 2009, the manga was transferred to Fujimi Shobo's "Monthly Dragon Age" magazine starting with the June 2009 issue. The first bound volume was released in Japan on June 9, 2008 under the "Kadokawa Comics Dragon Jr." imprint; the second volume was published on August 8, 2009.

John Rich (war correspondent)

John Rich (1917–present) was a war correspondent for NBC News.
Career.
Rich spent nearly 30 years as a war correspondent for NBC News. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he became a U.S. Marine in 1942 and made four D-Day landings in the Pacific Theater. After the war, while working in Tokyo for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service, he interviewed General Douglas MacArthur and traveled with Emperor Hirohito. Additionally, he covered Shanghai's fall to the communists.
Rich began working for NBC in late 1950 and arrived in Korea less than a week after the war began. He worked there for over three years- longer than any other American correspondent. Having been used mostly for radio, he appeared on The Today Show to cover the ceasefire talks and eventually became a television correspondent. After having covered the Korean War, he took a wide variety of assignments, heading the NBC bureau in Berlin for four years and reporting on the Vietnam War for ten years. He reported on nearly every major armed conflict that occurred during his time at NBC. By the end of his career, he became NBC's senior Asian correspondent and was appointed vice-president of RCA Corporation.
After having been retired for many years, Rich was featured in NBC Nightly News' Making a Difference segment on July 24, 2008.
Korean War coverage and photos.
Rich, a Peabody Award winner, had finally released the photographs that he had taken while covering the Korean War in 1950. The photos, taken with a Nikon Camera and covering a wide variety of subjects from children to generals, are all in color, presenting a rare picture of the "Forgotten War", which is known mostly through black and white images. He had taken hundreds of photos of the Korean War, but never of any other war. Forty of the photos were displayed at the KORUS HOUSE in the Korean Embassy in Washington DC from July 24, 2008 and remained so until August, 11. The photos were then also featured in an article in the November 2008 issue of the "Smithsonian Magazine".
In 2010, Rich sold the rights to distribute 173 photos to Seoul Selection for the first time. The same 173 photos were also turned into a book on May 12 with the same title.
Rich currently lives on the coast of Maine in the house in which he was born.

Arthur Wilson (writer)

Arthur Wilson (baptized 14 December 1595 – autumn 1652) was a seventeenth-century English playwright, historian, and poet. Though born a commoner, he worked professionally as a gentleman-in-waiting and steward to several of the most powerful Parliamentarians during the era leading up to the English Civil War. He is remembered today as a minor playwright who wrote several successful plays for London's Blackfriars Theatre as well as the author of "The History of Great Britain, being the Life and Reign of King James I", a valuable nonfiction work that documents the anti-Stuartism prevalent in the late Caroline era.
Biography.
Wilson was born in Yarmouth, England, the son of John Wilson and his wife Suzan, according to the baptismal register, but of Richard Wilson, according to a later entry in the matriculation register at Trinity College, Oxford, where he later attended school. In the 1620–25 period he served as secretary to Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, and accompanied the Earl on his military campaigns on the Continent. Despite getting on well with Essex for fifteen years, though, WIlson was dismissed when the earl's second wife took up against him. 
Upon his release, Wilson received a monthly pension from Essex and the opportunity for a formal education. At the age of 35, Wilson entered Oxford University (1631–33) where he studied first medicine and then religion for the next two years. Dismayed by the corruption that ran rampant in the clergy, however, he left the school and later entered the service of Essex's cousin, Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, as a steward. Wilson returned to Essex's service for the English Civil War. Wilson had a reputation as an adventurer; his autobiography, "Observations of God's Providence, in the Tract of my Life," records some of his adventures, like his 1642 rescue of the Countess Rivers from anti-Catholic rioters.
Works.
Theatre.
Wilson's autobiography contains many observations on the private theatrical performances conducted in aristocratic households during the seventeenth century, and he himself likely wrote many plays for private entertainments during his tenure with Essex. He recounts several instances of his works being performed at the home of Essex's grandmother, the Countess of Leicester. Only three of these plays have survived, though, including the tragicomedy "The Inconstant Lady," which was performed by the King’s Men in its premiere at the royal palace at Hampton Court in London on 30 September 1630; "The Swisser," which premiered at London's Blackfriars Theatre in 1631; and "The Corporal," which was also performed by the King's Men at Blackfriars and is speculatively dated to 1633. 
Though it is well-established that Wilson wrote "The Inconstant Lady" while still in service of Essex, it is unclear whether his latter two plays were completed during this period or during his time at Oxford. Dating is particularly difficult, because none of the plays were published during the seventeenth century, and "The Corporal" has survived only in a fragmentary manuscript that stops in Act II, scene 1. The other two dramas remained in manuscript until later publication, "The Inconstant Lady" in 1814 and "The Swisser" in 1904. "The Swisser" was performed in 1631 by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre; the manuscript preserves a cast list for that original production — significant, since it is one of only seven cast lists for the company that survive from the era of the later 1620s and early 1630s. 
History.
Wilson's notable non-dramatic work is his "The History of Great Britain, being the Life and Reign of King James I," which was published in 1653, a year after Wilson's death. (Indeed, none of Wilson's literary efforts was in print in his lifetime.) Wilson was not an admirer of the House of Stuart, as his history reveals; he reflects negatively on various figures of the Stuart era, including Sir Francis Bacon.
Poetry.
Wilson also wrote some verse; his "Upon Mr. J. Donne and his Poems" has been considered one of the better elegies on the poet and was printed in a late volume of Donne's collected works as a tribute.

Plot.
Robert's (Lee) life has been going just the way he wanted it to, from both a professional and personal standpoint. That is until his girlfriend Cheri (Williams) tells him she's expecting. While she feels they should get married, Robert still isn't quite sure if he's ready to take such a major step in his life. He tries to get advice from his friends, who all (besides not being married or in any sort of exclusive relationships of their own) basically tell him to stand firm in his decision if he doesn't feel he's ready. Cheri also has a group of friends however, and they are just as much in support of her opinion that the two should be looking to settle down as Robert's friends are of his. When they all get together to celebrate the baby shower, tensions inevitably flare, and a few unexpected secrets finally come to light, leading to a frothy and mirthful climax.

<doc id="18656734" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18656734" title="Type 95 75 mm Field Gun">
Type 95 75 mm Field Gun

The was a field gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was intended to replace the Type 38 75 mm Field Gun and the Type 41 75 mm Cavalry Gun in front line combat units, but due to operational and budgetary constraints, only a small number were produced, and the Type 38 and Type 41 continued to be used. The Type 95 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2595 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1935 in the Gregorian calendar.
History and development.
Prior to World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army was largely equipped with Krupp cannons from Germany. After the Versailles Treaty, the Japanese Army switched to the French Schneider company, and developed the Type 90 75 mm Field Gun loosely based on the Schneider et Cie Canon de 85 mle 1927. However, the Schneider design was very complex and expensive to build, requiring very tight dimensional tolerances which were beyond the limits of Japanese industry to sustain at the time. Maintenance was also difficult to sustain in front line combat service. The Army Technical Bureau, following combat experience gained in the Invasion of Manchuria and the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars reverted to a simpler and more rugged design for the Type 95 field gun, which entered production in 1935. The Type 95 75-mm gun has an appearance similar to the Model 90 75-mm gun. It is derived from the Model 1933 Schneider 75, which it closely resembles. However, only a total of 261 units were produced, and the Type 38 75 mm Field Gun and the Type 41 75 mm Cavalry Gun continued to be used by front line combat units until the surrender of Japan.
Design.
Although occasionally mentioned as a copy of the French Schneider et Cie Canon de 75 Mle 1933, this connection is dubious. The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and hydropneumatic recoil mechanism on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses. As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable for animal draft, and another with solid rubber tires and a beefed-up suspension for towing by motor vehicle.
Since it weighs only 400 pounds more than the Model 41 cavalry gun, it is possible that the Model 95 may be intended to replace that weapon. However, its use on Saipan and its close resemblance to the heavier Model 90 may indicate that the latter weapon is too heavy for efficient horse-draft, and too complex for the capabilities of Japanese industry. Though the Model 95 is split-trailed, it weighs actually less than the improved Model 38 75-mm gun. The Model 95 is much lighter than its Schneider prototype, and has a sliding wedge rather than an interrupted thread breechblock. It incorporates all features of modern Japanese design.
Combat record.
The appearance of the Type 95 75 mm field gun caused considerable confusion with both Allied military intelligence and with Japanese troops. The Type 95 was inferior in technology and performance to its predecessor,with less range and lower muzzle velocity. Although cheaper to build and to maintain, and less in weight, it was not well received by field commanders. It was primarily assigned to units in China.

History.
Version 1.0 release was in 1999 as a Macintosh only web application utilizing FileMaker Pro and Lasso and served using WebSTAR. At its release, it was the only commercial web-based help desk product available for Mac OS 9. Up to version 4.0, the application remained dependent upon Lasso as the programming language.
Version 4.0, released in January 2001, marked a new chapter in the development story with the transition to the PHP scripting language and MySQL as the database. Although the application was still available as a FileMaker Pro/Lasso solution, the option to run the application under open source projects on the newly available Mac OS X 10.0 provided the application with a unique niche in the fledging Mac OS X market.
In May 2001, Apple released WebObjects 5.0, freshly ported from Objective-C to Java, to the Mac OS X developer community. Web Help Desk development was moved completely over to WebObjects, with version 5.0 released in September, 2001. WebObjects 5.0 was also available for Windows and Solaris—this provided the first cross platform deployment opportunity for the Web Help Desk.
The Web Help Desk currently uses WebObjects 5.4 frameworks, and is typically run as a servlet in the Apache Tomcat servlet container, but can also be deployed as a traditional WebObjects application on Mac OS X Server.
The application uses several open source frameworks, including:
The Web Help Desk is notable as one of the earliest web-based help desk solutions, and as one of the only commercial software packages using WebObjects as the development platform—the same server side frameworks used by iTunes and the Apple Online Store. The application is also notable as an example of how a small ISV successfully transitioned a niche, Mac-only, application into a widely distributed cross-platform solution. It is used by Apple Inc., and other major technology, manufacturing, and media corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Time Warner Cable, as well as many major universities.

Preparata code

In coding theory, the Preparata codes form a class of non-linear double-error-correcting codes. They are named after Franco P. Preparata who first described them in 1968.
Construction.
Let "m" be an odd number, and "n" = 2"m" − 1. We first describe the extended Preparata code of length 2"n" + 2 = 2"m" + 1: the Preparata code is then derived by deleting one position. The words of the extended code are regarded as pairs ("X", "Y") of 2"m"-tuples, each corresponding to subsets of the finite field GF(2"m") in some fixed way.
The extended code contains the words ("X", "Y") satisfying three conditions
The Peparata code is obtained by deleting the position in "X" corresponding to 0 in GF(2"m").
Properties.
The Preparata code is of length 2"m"+1 − 1, size 2"k" where "k" = 2"m" + 1 − 2"m" − 2, and minimum distance 5.
When "m" = 3, the Preparata code of length 15 is also called the Nordstrom–Robinson code.

List of episodes.
A Fashion Baptism of Fire.
Original airdate: 28 April 2009
The thirteen new girls meet their new host, Sarah Murdoch, and are put through their paces straight away in front of Australia’s A-list of fashion. The first photo shoot reveals a new pack of “Bitchketeers”.
The girls arrive at a surprise press conference and runway show with fashion industry experts including Wayne Cooper and Collette Dinigan, the judges as well as Australia’s Next Top Model alumni Eboni Stocks, Samantha Downie, Alexandra Girdwood, Jordan Loukas and Demelza Reveley. Franky, Laura M and Clare are all praised for their runway walks whereas many of the others struggle. Cassi is scolded for swearing while on the runway, and Georgie is told she did not look confident. Franky is deemed the winner of the runway challenge, and is given immunity from elimination as her prize.
The models are then given the keys to their new house and are welcomed by bags of gifts. Cassi begins to annoy some of the other girls with what they perceive as attention seeking behaviour. In a house meeting Georgie and Franky attack Cassi, but other girls then jump to her defence, making Franky upset. The photo shoot takes place at Sydney Olympic Park, where they have to do a Swimwear Couture photo shoot Leah makes some nasty comments about Clare and her pale complexion, causing her to get upset. Franky and Georgie struggle with their shoot whereas Cassi and Tahnee excel.
In judging, Cassi is praised for her ability to transform in front of the camera, Eloise is commended for her amazing body, Madison is told that her photograph was stunning but there was only one usable picture, Franky delivered a good shot but was reprimanded for having poor film and Laura M is criticised for squinting in her photo. Adele and Laura T end up in the bottom two, Adele for not living up to her potential in the shoot and Laura T for criticising other girls when she delivered a less-than-stellar photograph despite previous modelling experience. Adele is spared, and Laura T is asked to leave the competition.
Let's Get Physical.
Original airdate: 5 May 2009
Last week's elimination forces the girls to get serious, but that won't stop any of their hidden agendas. Sarah has decided to go the old school NTM route and get these girls a nutritionist and a trainer. The girls learn about portion sizes and healthy eating before heading to a gym to learn about fitness.
The next day, the girls are sent to a gym, where they met with an Australian gymnastics champion. There, they go through a beginner’s gym class. Cassi “hurt” herself during this, and some girls don't believe this at all. Clare wins the challenge because she brings the most fashion to her routine. Her prize is going to the ballet with Sarah. She picks Tahnee to come with her because she got the second highest score.
The photo shoot is a challenging contest with Cosmopolitan as the client. It was also announced that the eight best photos would appear in the magazine as an editorial. At the photo shoot, Clare and Cassi shine, while most of the others fail to impress. 
While the girls wait before elimination, Tahnee, Lola, Franky, and Mikarla take turns trying on Cassi’s elimination dress and making fun of it. 
In the judging panel, at the first the judges was impressed with Clare and Adele's photo, and the two will be featured in Cosmo. Next step was Georgie, which she looked adorable in her photo, but Alex says it came much more from the dress, however, she will be featured in Cosmo. Leah and Lola was heavily criticized by the judges for looked boring and sleepy, so they won't be featured in Cosmo. Madison and Franky also received good photo with some mixed reviews but they also featured in Cosmo.
The next shot is Tahnee, which is very unimpressed the judges but she was able to be featured in Cosmo. Eloise and Mikarla comes next, but Eloise's shot is not as strong as last week while Mikarla's shot was improving, so Eloise won't be featured in Cosmo and Mikarla would. 7 girls has featured in Cosmo, 3 didn't, and 2 girls left while only 1 other page is left. Cassi comes next, but her shot was universally impressed the judges and blowing them away, so she would be featured in Cosmo, and there was no page left.
The last girl, Laura came to the judges, but her shot was deemed the best by the judges. Sarah has told her that there was no page left for her, which Laura also told that she was OK with that because "everybody had their part". However, the Cosmo editor told that her shot is very impressing and she will appeared in Cosmo as well, combining nine pages. Laura M earned First Call-out for her impressive photo but at the end, Georgie is in the bottom two pictures because the dress saved her shot. She’s joined by Leah, who is there for being too boring. In the end, Leah gets the boot because not getting the gig is far, far worse than boring the judges. 
Makeover Meltdown.
Original airdate: 12 May 2009
High Drama fills about the makeover week. When told that she is going to have all her hair cut off Franky threatens to go home rather than going through with it, protesting that her hair never grows and will look awful if short. When she sees it Franky is happy about the cut, realising that it suits her. Most of the girls are happy about their transformations despite the incredible differences that are wrought.
They meet with Nigel, a professional makeup artist for Maybelline, who gives them a makeup lesson. Mikarla and Georgie cheat by doing their own makeup and pay the price for doing so. After the lesson, they are given a challenge to perform in a Maybelline commercial, in which they have to deliver one line of their own. Cassi tells everyone the line she intends to use during the challenge, informing them that they are not to steal it. 
At the commercial shoot the director is impressed with Laura's ideas on her performance and delivery, but thinks Adele gives very little of herself. Jonathan and the director love Lola's script, which she is blatant about stealing from Cassi, which leaves Cassi devastated when she is told she can't use her line as it's already been used. The theft of her line bashes her confidence and means her delivery lacks enthusiasm or conviction. 
After the challenge, a furious Cassi confronts Lola regarding her 'theft' of the much-rehearsed line. Representatives of Maybelline are on the set and this outburst doesn't impress anyone. The announcement that Lola is the winner of the challenge does not go down well at all with Cassi who is still trying very hard to control her temper.
Six the next morning the girls are told that the photoshoot will be 'natural beauty'. Mikarla is reduced to tears when she has trouble with the light in her eyes, Madison can't stop her frowning, Lola can't relax her mouth, and Franky's personality fails to come through in any shot. Clare and Tahnee shine, while Cassi steals the shoot.
The night before elimination there is a confrontation between Franky and the other girls in the house when it is revealed that Franky is talking negatively about everyone.
At elimination the judges are impressed with Tahnee, Eloise, Cassi and Clare's photos, but they aren't so impressed with those of Mikarla and Georgie which leads to the two girls ending up in the bottom 2. In the end, Sarah tells Georgie that she's a bit too young for the competition and she is sent home, though she vows to continue on. 
Runway Hell.
Original airdate: 19 May 2009
This week, the girls were put to the test on their runway skills with runway coach Mink Sadowsky. Clare, Franky and Adele excelled but Cassi, Lola, Madison and Mikarla had a difficult time with their walks. In an effort to make the girls take things more seriously after their walking lesson, Sarah sends them on an early runway assignment to the fruit market. The girls had to walk on the back of a truck in front of the market workers. While Tahnee, Clare, Adele and Franky excel, Madison and Mikarla failed, Tahnee is deemed the winner of the runway challenge and she is given a $10,000 shopping spree at The Corner Store, and chooses to give Adele $1,000 of her prize.
In the house, Cassi physically threatens Clare because she woke Cassi while showering. Also, Tahnee and Eloise put a McDonald's bag filled with cigarettes on Mikarla's bed in an effort to make her quit smoking. This backfires and results in Mikarla calling Tahnee fat and attacking Eloise; Cassi then pours the cigarette contents in Eloise's bed as pay back.
This week's photo shoot was with U by Kotex where the girls had to strut their stuff while showing confidence. Monty Koble, a Kotex representative, said that the best photo will be used as an advertisement, giving all of the girls extra incentive to perform at the shot. At elimination, Franky finds out that her photo will be used in a U ad campaign. Adele earned First Call-out this week for her massive improvement but ultimately in a double elimination Mikarla is sent home because she has a bored attitude and doesn't take the competition seriously, and Eloise is eliminated for not taking on the judges previous criticism and being a one-look wonder.
Diamonds and the Desert.
Original airdate: 26 May 2009
Cassi is extremely shocked that Mikarla has been evicted in the previous week, and considers quitting the competition. The other models view it as one less girl in the competition and don't encourage her to stay.
This week the girls are put to the test on a dirty farm shoot with a nasty stylist, ridiculous wardrobe and some squealing pigs. The shoot aggravates most girls, Cassi in particular. Sarah then reveals that the shoot is fake. This weeks challenge has the girls wearing Cerrone jewelry and posing with props made of ice in front to an A-List crowd. Lola shows commitment by placing her entire face on the ice for the duration of the challenge, and receives an 18 caret A$2,000 necklace. This further disappoints Cassi and she expresses her strong desire to leave the competition during a phone call to her mother.
The next day, it is revealed that the girls will be going to South Australia, Clare's home state, into the Outback for the photo shoot. After arriving in Adelaide, they are driven to Parachilna, a remote town amongst the Australian Outback. Russell James is this weeks photographer, and the shoot has the girls posing with a male model in high fashion lingerie. The heat of the desert along with the large amount of flies makes the photoshoot a challenge for most girls, but Cassi, Clare, Tahnee, Adele and Franky excel. Madison is criticized for her shoot as she is unable to remove the frown from her face and for moving awkwardly. Laura also performs poorly, displaying discomfort in her body and not connecting it with her face.
At panel, Clare's impressive photo and attitude earned her First Call-out but Madison and Laura end up in the bottom 2. Laura is saved due to her better portfolio leaving Madison eliminated for lack of versatility despite having some stellar photos in the past episodes.
Cruising the Catwalk.
Original airdate: 2 June 2009
The show opens with the girls talking about how much they miss Madison. They are then taken to the Harper’s Bazaar office to learn about fashion, as the very top models have a strong sense of personal style and are very knowledgeable about the fashion industry. The girls are taught about the three latest trends and are divided into teams to replicate the trends. All three teams do pretty poorly and the editor from the magazine is not impressed.
This week’s challenge is walking for Alex Perry and his consultant, Trevor. The girls take turns walking for them and they are going to pick two girls to be in a ridiculously fancy fashion show. Alex and Trevor choose Clare and Adele to win the challenge. Tahnee was also chosen to be in the show.
Virgin Blue flew all of the girls' mothers to the house for a visit.
This week’s photo shoot was all Chanel. The girls had to model on a rickety pylon, but a lot of girls fell flat on the photo shoot.
At elimination Adele's shot was deemed as the best ever shot in the competition so far by Sarah. Adele's shot also proclaimed by Alex as a real Chanel girl and so improving. Clare also received mediocre praise, while Tahnee, even if her shot is a bit strange because the shot didn't even took after they started the photo shoot (it took before it). Richard said that every Tahnee's shot is boring, catalog, and predictable, so it's the only shot of Tahnee that really works.
Lola received mixed critic for her shot, while Cassi was criticized for her shot is getting worse week by week either than getting better. Adele received First Call-Out but, Franky and Laura landed ended up in the bottom two for producing such a dreadful photos, the judges contemplated about giving one Laura more chance but in the end Franky was given a reprieve and Laura was sent packing
Media Virgins.
Original airdate: 9 June 2009
This week, the girls were thrusted into the media spotlight for a media lesson with Charlotte Dawson. The girls were representing V Australia and had to learn a variety of lines to promote the newest Virgin airline. All of the girls failed to win over the media, especially Franky, who jokingly threatened to kill a media official, and Tahnee, who spoke about Victoria's Secret for the entire time.
After the criteria, the girls received a Sarah Mail which lead to an early photoshoot. The girls had to model designer gowns while jumping a trampoline. The photos had a special meaning as the photos would be up for auction on the Australia's Next Top Model website to help support Fashion Targets Breast Cancer. Cassi, Clare and Tahnee impress the international photographers, Denis Montalbetti and Gay Campbell, but Adele and Lola disappointed.
The next day, all of the girls attended Hugos Lounge for a Fashion Targets Breast Cancer charity event. The girls had to model their designer gowns from the previous photo shoot and encourage the fashion A-Listers to bid on their gowns. Prior to the event, Ruby Rose and Mink Sadowsky spoke to the girls about the foundation and Adele revealed that she had her own breast cancer scare. All of the girls modeled their garments on the runway but Franky was a stand out and was deemed the best, while Cassi was deemed the worst. This resulted in Cassi being the worker for a day and Franky adjudicating all of Cassi's tasks.
During elimination, all of the girls got a 'caning' by Alex Perry due to their terrible outfits; despite this, all of the girls received positive praise for their pictures this week. While Clare and Tahnee were deemed safe by the judges, the judges were concerned with Adele as they feared that 'One look Adele' was coming back, and Cassi as they worried that she was lying about smoking and not putting in enough effort compared to the other contestants. Despite this, Franky and Lola ended up in the bottom two as they had the worst photos in the bunch and both hadn't made any significant improvements. Franky was saved for the second time in a row while Lola was sent home.
Tears and Emotion.
Original airdate: 16 June 2009
At the start of the week, the girls are met by Opera singer, Sharon Zhai, singing in their backyard, who gives them a Sarah Mail. The girls immediately think it is a performing arts lesson, some even think that they have to sing opera.
The Sarah mail sends the girls to the National Institute of Dramatic Arts and the girls are greeted by Jonathan and Mark Gaal, who is an artistic associate and Ana Maria Belo, a tutor and previous student at NIDA. The girls are put through a range of acting challenges including controlling laughter and delivering a eulogy at a funeral.
The next day, a puppet show was performed for the girls, then one of the puppets hand the girls a Sarah Mail preparing them for their challenge. Then, the girls meet at Ogilvy and are met by Jonathan and commercial director, Adrian Hayward. Jonathan reveals to the girls that are auditioning to feature in a nation-wide Telstra commercial. The girls pair up and audition for Jonathan and Adrian. Tahnee excels and lands the main role in the commercial and is joined by Franky and Clare, but Adrian reveals that Clare was too prissy and might be replaced by Cassi if she doesn’t perform well on the day of the commercial. It was also revealed that the losers, Adele and Cassi, would be assistants on the day.
The following day, the girls arrive at set of the commercial and film it perfectly. Despite feeling nervous about performing, Chantal Walker, a Telstra representative, was so impressed with Clare from the start, that Adrian told her that she would remain in the rest of the commercial. While Adele and Cassi slaved away doing jobs as crew members, Tahnee, Clare and Franky enjoyed the experience of filming a national commercial.
At Fox Studios, the girls posed with Fords from different decades, replicating different style icons. Sarah revealed that she would watch all of the girls on the shoot and also revealed that there were only four Etihad tickets to their International destination, London. They portrayed celebrity style icons:
Before elimination, Cassi reveals that she no longer wants to be in the competition and will tell the judges that she wants to quit. This gets the other girls excited as that means the other girls get to go to London. At elimination, Cassi did not tell the judges she wanted to leave and when she told the other girls in the waiting room, Adele broke down at the idea that she might not make it overseas and Franky and Tahnee yell at Cassi for lying and not wanting to be there.
Previously, for the second time Clare became the brightest star of the bunch, impressed the judges by her Twiggy-esque shot, eventough Sarah has noted that mostly of her film was on the pose. Tahnee also excel, reflecting Elizabeth Taylor greatly and also selling the car. Both of Cassi and Adele's shot met with mediocre praise, Cassi with her simplicity but make her photo works and Adele's bone structure and skin are highly praised. On the other way, Franky was highly criticized for her photo, although she had good energy, she didn't excused it well. At the end, Franky was sent home after three times appeared in the bottom two.
London's Calling.
Original airdate: 23 June 2009
The girls are off to London, and after seeing their swanky apartment and getting a good night’s sleep. They arriving at London Heathrow Airport and greeted by Sarah's pal Gerry DeVeaux (Britain's Next Top Model, Cycle 4 judge) takes them on a shopping tour of London - High Street and TopShop, then some higher end brands, then Selfridges, where Supermodel Elle Macpherson is there to greet them. Elle feeds them stuff about how they are beautiful and need to be grounded and supported and what not. Adele wins the paparazzi challenge and chooses to take Cassi because she hasn’t won a challenge yet. 
The next day, the girls have go sees at Storm and Premiere Model Management. At Storm, the managing director had nice things to say about everyone; Clare's skin and hair, Adele's improved photos (and for her Chanel shot, she told that it was the best ad photo she had ever seen), Tahnee's pretty face and Cassi's top model potential. At Premiere, they’re a bit more critical about Tahnee’s measurements, Adele’s height, and Cassi’s and Clare's walks. The Premier agents are most impressed by Cassi and Clare, stating that Cassi "was the first one they spotted when the girls walked in the door" and that Clare's look is "perfect".
The photo shoot is high fashion meets London sights. Gerry was impressed by everyone, but again Cassi shined above the rest. All the girls looked great, but it was clearly Adele who struggled the most. They return to Australia and Alice Burdeu is the guest judge. The judges, with the exception of Sarah, all hate Clare’s photo, think Adele looks cheap, think Cassi looks bored, and think that while Tahnee’s photo is the best of the bunch, it isn’t that great. After a tough deliberation, Clare’s complete package puts her on top and Cassi's strong performance in London keeps her safe. Tahnee and Adele land in the bottom two and Adele’s one note look ends up sending her home. 
The Final Three.
Original airdate: 30 June 2009
The girls meet at Priscilla’s Modelling agency and are met with Priscilla Leighton-Clarke and Sarah Murdoch who tells the girls that they are going on castings for Rosemount’s Australian Fashion Week. Sarah states that this is the biggest challenge the girls will face and the girls are given their portfolios and head off to their 5 castings.
First, the girls visit Ginger & Smart. Cassi impresses the designers with her strong look but almost falls over when showing them her walk. Clare is the only girl that books Ginger & Smart. Secondly, the girls visit Wayne Cooper and he dislikes Tahnee’s walk so he ultimately chooses Clare and Cassi to walk in her show, even though Wayne Cooper states she needs to work on her walk. The next casting was Nicola Finetti. Once again, Cassi almost falls over but Clare and Tahnee perform well due to their walk and sexy vibe so they are booked for the fashion show. The next audition is with Anna & Boy, Cassi is the only girl picked as the designers feel she has a more suited look compared to Tahnee and Clare. Finally, the girls audition for the Diet Coke ‘Little Black Dress’ runway show and are met with Jonathan, Kim Marks and the producer of the fashion show. The girls all succeed and book the job but Cassi has a breakdown after her audition because she thought she didn't do well.
The first show was Ginger & Smart, and Clare impresses the judges as she performed beautifully on the runway with nor Tahnee or Cassi standing in her way. The next show was Wayne Cooper, which featured Clare and Cassi. Clare, once again, performed well but the judges were disappointed with Cassi as she underperformed on the catwalk. The Nicola Finetti show was next, and Tahnee and Clare performed well and impressed the judges. The next show, Anna & Boy, featured Cassi, who performed significantly better than Wayne Cooper runway performance because Cassi is much more suited to swimwear. Finally, all of the girls grace the runway for the Diet Coke ‘Little Black Dress’ runway show and all of the girls performed perfectly on the runway, impressing all of the judges.
The next day, Sarah reveals that Clare won a trip to Broome with a friend as she was the deemed the best performer during fashion week. After her win, Clare is giving the opportunity to ring her mum to tell her the great news, but the two losers were getting a bit annoyed with Clare's prissiness. and then her mum reveals that the girls have a Sarah Mail which was slipped under the hotel door, hinting to the girls that a photo shoot is coming up and like always they guessed what they theme would be.
The next day, the girls arrive on Garie Beach "National Park" to meet with Jonathan and their photographer, Jez Smith. Jonathan and Jez reveal to the girls that they are going to be photographed together and will be wearing natural makeup. Not only do the girls have to work together and embrace one another but they have to deal with the strong winds, rain and large waves. After their successful group shot, the girls are photographed individually; Clare struggles to find intensity in her eyes and modelled a bit too much and Jaz said "she is coming up with some really weird poses that don't fit her personality", Cassi amazed Jez and Jonathan because of her creative poses and powerful body and eyes. Tahnee performed well but Jonathan was worried about her body but at the end she presented some amazing photos.
At elimination, Sarah asks the girls to tell the judges why they want to be in the top 2 as well as describing their strengths and weaknesses. All of the girls break down in tears and are praised by the judges for their responses. The judges were also blown away with their group and individual photos, which made choosing the final 2 very difficult. After a long and hard deliberation, Clare and Cassi are revealed as the bottom two. Both with their strengths and weaknesses addressed, Sarah announces that Cassi will join Tahnee in the top two. Clare was eliminated even though she booked the most shows for fashion week.
When Clare was about to leave the house, she threw Cassi's frog doll to the pool, just like Lola did when she was eliminated a few weeks before.
Cassi's place marks the history of Australia's Next Top Model for a girl to be in the final two without receiving a first call-out.
Live Finale.
Original airdate: 7 July 2009
Live from Luna Park, Sarah Murdoch hosted the finale of Australia's Next Top Model Cycle 5. The finale began with an introduction of the judging panel that consisted of Charlotte Dawson, Alex Perry, Jonathan Pease, Priscilla Leighton-Clare, Claudia Navone, Russell James and of course, Sarah Murdoch. Soon after, the 11 eliminated contestants were re-introduced and modelled on the catwalk while Jessica Mauboy performed her hit, Burn. 
Sarah then introduced the girls, including the final 2, as they all performed on the runway wearing designer clothes from "The Corner Shop". After the girls spilled the beans on many memorable moments from the series, Sarah announced that Clare had won Australia's Favourite Model, winning her $5,000 thanks to Impulse.
After Tahnee and Cassi were interviewed, the voting lines closed and the judges were ready to vote after viewing the girls' portfolios, but not after a quick good luck message from the one and only Brüno. Before the judges votes were conducted, Tahnee and Cassi were surprised when both of their mothers joined them on stage to give them support during the judging. Jonathan Pease begun the voting and stated that he was looking for 'the whole package' and his vote went to Tahnee while Claudie Navone and Russell James voted for Cassi due to her strong look and her ability to take stunning photographs. After a commercial break, the judging votes continued with Sarah giving her vote to Tahnee as she felt that Cassi was not ready to model while Tahnee was ready to perform. Priscilla Leighton-Clarke voted for Cassi yet still had concern over whether she was ready to model. In a shock vote, Charlotte Dawson, who has supported Cassi throughout the entire competition, gave her vote to Tahnee as she was concerned that Cassi wouldn't have the drive to model and just return to her old life and Alex Perry voted for Cassi due to her good looks and her ability to transform in front of the camera. With only one vote between Tahnee and Cassi, it was up to the public to decide who would be Australia's Next Top Model. Unfortunately, throughout the judges deliberation, Tahnee had a nose bleed which brought light to a serious part of the show.
After all of the votes were tallied, Sarah revealed that Tahnee Atkinson had won "Australia's Next Top Model", beating Cassi Van Den Dungen. Tahnee made becoming the first winner of "Australia's Next Top Model" hails from Western Australia.
Controversy.
Before the cycle premiered, there was controversy over a number of issues.
Sixteen year old Cassi Van Den Dungen was criticised for being a proud bogan and "smoker" with her mother in support, having to take anger-management classes to control her temper whilst participating in the series and for being engaged and living with a 25 year old bricklayer. She also received backlash from Hume City Council mayor Jack Ogilvie over her comments in which she described her hometown of Sunbury as "like a ghetto", with the mayor stating that she is a "very immature, silly little girl" and that "she owes Sunbury an apology.

Jeziorzany, Lublin Voivodeship

Jeziorzany is a village in Lubartów County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Jeziorzany. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Lubartów and north-west of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 780, and used to be a town in 1498 - 1870. 
The village was originally called Przetoczno; in 1564 its name was changed into Lysobyki, and in 1965, to Jeziorzany. It is located on a small island, in the middle of the Wieprz river valley. Jeziorzany is famous for its 16th century street grid system, which has not changed for almost 500 years. Most of the houses are made of timber, with specially decorated porches and window shutters facing the streets. 
The history of Przetoczno dates back to February 3, 1498, when, upon request of Voivode of Sandomierz, Mikolaj z Ostrowa, King Jan Olbracht granted it town charter. In 1530, the town belonged to the Zbaski family, and in the same year, Lukasz Zbaski asked King Sigismund I Old to confirm the town charter. In 1564, the name of the town was changed into Lysobyki, and until the Partitions of Poland, it was part of County of Stezyca, Sandomierz Voivodeship. 
In 1815 - 1915, Lysobyki belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and in 1831, during the November Uprising, a skirmish took place here between Polish and Russian units. In 1870 the Russians stripped Lysobyki of the town charter; same happened to a number of other towns in northern Lesser Poland. In 1965, the name of the village was changed into Jeziorzany.

Bio-fermentation technology

Bio-fermentation technology makes it possible to grow a number of fungi in large tanks and, in a matter of days, a large quantity can be produced. The technology has now become highly advanced and is making previously rare herbs like Cordyceps and Ganoderma much more accessible. Many studies indicate that the chemical nature of this biotechnology Cordyceps is almost identical to that of the wild variety. The Cordyceps contained in most commercial products is produced by this technology.
Wild Cordyceps.
Studies show that wild Cordyceps is richer in certain components and the proportion of components is different, which probably makes a difference in activity. Cultivated Cordyceps is still a premium tonic herb and the Cordyceps most commonly found in Chinese herb stores is cultivated.
Advantages of bio-fermentation.
Standardization.
Highly controlled by scientific means during its growth and "standardized", every batch is virtually identical and, in a sense, "perfect." This is very important in pharmaceutical terms because without standardization, it is difficult or impossible to develop drug-type standards for substances like Cordyceps. Once a herb can be standardized, all kinds of studies can be conducted that will be accepted by the scientific community. However, standardization, by itself, does not make a product effective.
Cost.
Products can be produced more cheaply by bio-fermentation. High quality wild Cordyceps is rare and now sells for well over a thousand dollars a pound in cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York or London. The culture-grown Cordyceps is available at a third of the cost, with approximately the same benefits. Fermentation technology makes this substance more readily available.
Vegetarian.
Wild Cordyceps, by weight, is mostly caterpillar. For vegetarians, and those who do not want to consume caterpillars, the new technology provides a solution. The fermentation technology does not include the caterpillar in the growing process. The fungus is grown without the use of animal nutrients and the result is a 100% pure "vegetarian" health product.

Jang Won-sam

Jang Won-Sam (Hangul: 장원삼, Hanja: 張洹三) (born June 9, 1983 in Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea) is a South Korean left-handed starting pitcher who plays for the Samsung Lions in the Korea Baseball Organization.
Amateur career.
As a junior at Yongma High School in Masan, South Korea, Jang was selected by the Hyundai Unicorns with the 89th pick in the 2nd round (97th overall) of the 2002 KBO Draft. However, he entered Kyungsung University upon graduation from high school instead of turning pro directly.
In 2004, as a junior at Kyungsung University Jang made his first appearance for the South Korea national baseball team at the 2nd World University Baseball Championship in Tainan City, Taiwan. There he led his team the bronze medal alongside Oh Seung-Hwan and Jeong Keun-Woo.
In 2005, Jang was selected for the South Korea national team again, and participated in the Baseball World Cup held in the Netherlands. He helped the team win the silver medal, finishing 4th in strikeouts (24). He pitched an eight shutout inning victory over South Africa in the preliminary round, and appeared in seven of South Korea's 11 games.
Professional career.
Hyundai Unicorns & Heroes.
Signed by the Hyundai Unicorns in 2006, Jang started his pro career as a starting pitcher. In the 2006 KBO season, he finished runner-up to Ryu Hyun-Jin for Rookie of the Year with 2nd in strikeouts (142), 5th in ERA (2.85) and 7th in wins (12), and was selected to the All-Star team. After the season, he was selected for the South Korea national team and competed in the 2006 Asian Games held in Doha, Qatar.
During the 2007 season, he went 9−10 with 132 strikeouts in 168.2 innnings, finishing 10th in ERA (3.63).
In the 2008 season, Jang finished with a 12–8 record and a 2.85 ERA in 167.2 innings. He was 4th in wins, 5th in ERA and 4th in strikeouts (126). In August 2008, Jang competed for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2008 Summer Olympics, where they won the gold medal in the baseball tournament. In the tournament, he pitched a 10−0 complete game shutout victory over the Netherlands and tossed 4.1 innings of scoreless relief against China.
In March 2009, Jang was called up to the South Korea national baseball team for the 2009 World Baseball Classic prior to the 2009 KBO season, but had a disappointing performance, pitching to a 5.06 ERA. In South Korea's second game in Round 1 against Japan, Jang came on in relief in the 3rd inning but allowed 3 runs and 4 hits in 2.2 innings pitched. He started the Pool 1 title match against Japan in Round 2, but went only 3 innings allowing 2 runs and 5 hits including the solo home run by Seiichi Uchikawa. Jang struggled the 2009 KBO season with a 5.54 ERA and a record of 4-8, by far the worst of his career.
Samsung Lions.
After the 2009 season, Jang was traded to the Samsung Lions with ₩3 billion won ($3 million). He bounced back in the 2010 season to finish sixth in the league in ERA (3.46), seventh in wins (13) and eighth in strikeouts (115).

Eupatorium album

Eupatorium album, or White thoroughwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant in Asteraceae native from the eastern states of the USA. Like other members of the genus "Eupatorium", it flowers with large numbers of small white heads. The flower heads have disc florets but no ray florets. It grows a half meter to one meter tall, making it one of the shorter "Eupatorium" species.
It is capable of hybridizing with other "Eupatorium" species including "Eupatorium sessilifolium" and "Eupatorium serotinum". Its appearance is similar to "Eupatorium altissimum", but differs in that the bracts (located at the base of the flower head) taper to a long point.
"E. album" is native to the eastern United States, from the Atlantic coast to as far west as Louisiana, Ohio, and New York.

Never Gonna Fall in Love Again

"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again" is a song co-written and recorded by American pop rock artist Eric Carmen. It was released as the second single from Carmen's self-titled debut solo album, the song peaked at number 11 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in June 1976, remaining in the Top 40 for ten weeks. The song reached number one on the "Billboard" Easy Listening chart.
The melody of "Never Gonna Fall in Love Again" is based on the third movement from the Second Symphony by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.
On his second solo LP, "Boats Against the Current", Carmen had a subsequent Top 40 hit entitled "She Did It," which was the antithesis of "Never Gonna Fall in Love Again." It is a happy answer to the loneliness and lovelessness described in this song and its equally melancholy predecessor, "All By Myself".
"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again" was a UK hit for Dana in 1976, an Australian hit for Mark Holden in 1975, and covered by John Travolta in 1980.
It should not be confused with a song of the same title, sometimes written as "Never Gonna Fall in Love (Again)" composed by Elton John and Tom Robinson, which Robinson issued as a single in 1979 and John included on his album "21 at 33" in 1980, or with the song from Snow Patrol's second album, "When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up".

Alessandro Siciliani

Alessandro Siciliani is an Italian conductor of opera and symphonic music. He is also a composer of symphonic music. Siciliani was born in Florence, Italy in 1952, the son of Ambra and Francesco Siciliani, the celebrated opera impresario. Siciliani currently resides in Columbus, Ohio where he was the Music Director of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra from 1992 to 2004.
Life and career.
Siciliani's early life was spent growing up in the opera world of Italy where his father was the director of the country's most prominent opera company, La Scala from 1957-1966. His musical interests were formed while attending his father's rehearsals where he had the opportunity to rub shoulders with the world's leading conductors, musicians and opera stars.
Siciliani received his musical training at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan and at the Santa Cecilia Academy in Rome. His studies focused on conducting, which he studied with Franco Ferrara, piano, and composition, graduating with highest honors in all three.
As a conductor, Siciliani has divided his time between opera and the symphonic repertoire. In opera, he conducted extensively at the New York City Opera and made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera on opening night of the 1988-1989 season. Most recently he conducted at the Mariinsky Theatre (formerly the Kirov) in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 2008. As a symphonic conductor he has performed with major orchestras in Prague, Munich, Cologne, Dallas, Pittsburgh, and Washington DC, among many others.
From 1992 to 2004 he was the music director of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. During his time on the podium the orchestra achieved some of its greatest successes to date, increasing its audience and celebrating its 50th anniversary with a debut appearance at Carnegie Hall. Siciliani's vivid interpretations of the romantic symphonic repertoire and of Italian opera endeared him to audiences in Columbus where he remains a popular figure. In July 2008, he was enthusiastically received when he returned to the podium to conduct the musicians of the Columbus Symphony in a benefit concert during the CSO's recent contract dispute.
Currently, Siciliani maintains his career as a conductor, making guest appearances in Europe and the U.S. He also continues composing, writing works for symphony and chorus.

Big Boi discography

The discography of American rapper Big Boi consists of two studio albums, one mixtape, twenty-two singles, five promotional singles and twenty-five music videos. Big Boi initially achieved success as a member of the hip hop duo Outkast with fellow rapper André 3000; they have recorded and released six studio albums together, and their singles "Ms. Jackson", "Hey Ya!" and "The Way You Move" have all topped the US "Billboard" Hot 100. In 1995, Big Boi made a guest appearance on the single "Dirty South" by American hip hop group Goodie Mob, which peaked at number 92 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he made several other appearances on commercially successful singles, including "All n My Grill" by rapper Missy Elliott, "A.D.I.D.A.S." by rapper Killer Mike and "Girlfight" by singer Brooke Valentine; these songs charted on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
Big Boi released his first two solo singles – "Royal Flush" and "Sumthin's Gotta Give" – in 2008, with "Ringtone" following in 2009. All three songs were recorded for his purported debut studio album "": however, due to legal complications resulting from Big Boi's departure from his former record label Jive Records, the album's release was considerably delayed and was not released until 2010. The eventual first single from "Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty", titled "Shutterbugg", peaked at number 60 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, as well as number 32 on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 on the UK R&B Chart. The album spawned the single "Follow Us", a collaboration with rock group Vonnegutt. Following its eventual release, "Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty" debuted at number 3 on the US "Billboard" 200, and appeared on several other national album charts. Big Boi's second studio album, "Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors", was released on December 11, 2012 in the United States, and peaked at number 34 on the "Billboard" 200 in the first week following its release. The album was preceded by the release of the singles "Gossip", "She Said OK" and "Mama Told Me".

Wasco Union High School

Wasco Union High School (abbr. WUHS) is a public American senior high school set in Wasco, California. The school is part of the Wasco Union High School District and takes in incoming freshman from the Wasco Union School District, Maple School District, Lost Hills Union School District, Semitropic School District, St. John’s Catholic School, and North Kern Christian School.
The Auditorium is the City of Wasco's only listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
WUHS was established in 1915 when the voters of the Cleveland, Maple, Poplar, Wildwood, Semitropic, and Wasco elementary school districts approved the formation of a high school, to coincide the new addition of the Wasco Union High School District that year. 28 students were enrolled at WUHS for its inaugural year and classes were held in a rented auditorium-like building called Wasco Hall. In August 1916, a new high school building for WUHS was approved; it was completed within six months and cost about $50,000. 61 students were enrolled at the time of the dedication on March 3, 1917. After 1917, as new structures were added to the campus, the original building was referred to simply as the Main Building.
In the years following the opening of the Main Building, a host of new buildings were added to the campus: an industrial arts building in 1925, an auditorium in 1929, a gymnasium in 1931, an agricultural addition to the industrial arts building in 1934, the first phase of the science building in 1935, then the second in 1939. A cafeteria and a language arts building were added in 1949, a library and a music building in 1953, a new classroom building and a bus garage in 1957, and a new administration building in 1959.
In recent history, WUHS has undergone tremendous change. For instance, the enrollment pattern from the 1925-1926 school year through the 2005-2006 school year showed the school’s student body expanding every decade (aside from the 1975-1976 school year through the 1985-1986 school year) and is revealed in the following figures, given in ten year increments: 1925-1926 (143 students); 1935-1936 (299 students); 1945-1946 (385 students); 1955-1956 (546 students); 1965-1966 (879 students); 1975-1976 (869 students); 1985-1986 (854 students); 1995-1996 (960 students) and 2005-2006 (1,551 students). This led to an increase in student enrollment and, should the Wasco Union High School District sustain its present rate of growth, projections indicate that the enrollment at WUHS will reach 2,200 students by the year 2010. This has led the district to begin preliminary planning for a second comprehensive high school to take in the influx of students within the district.
Auditorium.
The school's auditorium is the oldest building on its campus. The Renaissance Revival auditorium was designed by Ernest J. Kump. In addition to school performances, the building also hosted social events and visiting musicians, performers, and preachers. The auditorium was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.
Administration.
The following is a list of the administration department at WUHS:
Academics.
All students enrolled at WUHS must at least meet the following criteria before graduation:
In total, 220 credits are necessary for a student at WUHS to graduate. Also, every student who graduates must pass the CAHSEE and an approved Algebra course.
Because WUHS is situated in a largely rural community, the school has for many years offered a program that places heavy emphasis on the development of both vocational and agricultural skills. Agriculture remains a major element of the school’s curriculum as evidenced by the fact that some 500 WUHS students take agriculture related course work. Agriculture students have an opportunity to learn the practical aspects of agriculture on the district’s school farm which operates in conjunction with a farm lab where instruction is provided in welding, agricultural mechanics, plant science, and animal care.
In addition, WUHS provides the following "advanced" courses for those who want a challenge and/or want to get college credit:
Athletics.
The athletic director for WUHS is Raul Rangel. WUHS sports teams are called the Tigers, and have their home games on campus. The Tigers participate in the South Sequoia League (Div. IV, CIF Central Section) and have varsity and JV teams. Below are all the sports that WUHS participates in and their respective season:

The Swisser

The Swisser is a Caroline era stage play, a tragicomedy written by Arthur Wilson. It was performed by the King's Men in the Blackfriars Theatre in 1631, and is notable for the light in throws on the workings of the premier acting company of its time.
Though Humphrey Moseley entered the play into the Stationers' Register on 4 September 1646, no edition of the drama was printed in the seventeenth century. The play remained in manuscript until it was published in the early 1900s. The manuscript, now "Add. MS. 36,749" in the collection of the British Museum, is in the author's hand.
The play.
"The Swisser" shares the primary fault of Caroline drama as a whole; it is unoriginal and highly derivative of earlier works. Felix Schelling catalogued the play's stock elements as "the lecherous tyrant; the love-lorn girl page; the banished lord...; two old men of noble houses, enemies; their children, in love; poison evaded by the substitution of a sleeping potion; a fair captive generously treated by a chivalrous soldier, her captor; and...consanguinity a bar to virtuous love." Schelling cites "Campaspe", "Romeo and Juliet", "The Malcontent", "Philaster", and Tis Pity She's a Whore" as dramatic precedents. (He also concedes that the play "is not bad, as such productions go.")
The cast.
The cast list supplied by the manuscript is one of only eight extant King's Men lists from the period of the 1620s and the early 1630s, making it a valuable source of information on the company in this era.
Greville, Penn and Smith were hired men, and Goughe, Thompson, and Trigg were boy players filling female roles. The other six were the "sharers," partners, permanent members of the company. The burly Lowin plays a character of "great Beard and Bulke" — Smith's Asprandus and Greville's Iseas are "two little Pigmies" in comparison (Act III, scene 2).
other seven King's Men cast lists are for the company's productions of John Webster's "The Duchess of Malfi", Philip Massinger's "The Roman Actor", "The Picture", and "Believe as You List", Lodowick Carlell's "The Deserving Favourite", John Clavell's "The Soddered Citizen", and John Fletcher's "The Wild Goose Chase". The 1629 quarto of John Ford's "The Lover's Melancholy" provides a roster of the 17 actors involved, but doesn't assign them to their roles.
Synopsis.
The play is set in Lombardy, and bases its characters on actual historical figures of the early seventh century A.D.
As the play opens, Lombard soldiers are fleeing the battlefield, after defeat by the forces of Ravenna. The Swiss mercenary Andrucho, the title character, observes and comments upon the action. The King of the Lombards enters with his courtiers, including his cowardly and defeated general Timentes. (Andrucho, an unsubtle soldier, functions as something like the King's jester; the King calls him his "bandog," and allows the Swiss to criticize the courtiers with little restraint.) The King demands that Timentes rally the troops and lead a counterattack. Andrucho and the old courtier Clephis speak up critically; Clephis in particular advises the King to replace Timentes with the banished nobleman Arioldus. The Lombard troops themselves cry out and demand Arioldus for their commander.
The second scene shows Arioldus at his country estate; he lives in retirement with his books, glad to be away from the royal court. Andrucho comes to visit him; their conversation reveals that the Swiss mercenary is actually Aribert, another banished Lombard nobleman. Suddenly, courtiers begin arriving at Arioldus's house, assuring him of their (previously invisible) support and affection. Clearly, a change is in the wind. The King arrives, reverses Arioldus's banishment, and appoints him general of the army. The common troops are revitalized, and Arioldus wins a quick (offstage) victory over the army of Ravenna.
Arioldus comes away from his victory with a young female captive called Eurinia. An honorable man, Arioldus protects the virtue of his captive; but she quickly becomes a focus of courtly gossip. When the King meets her, he is strongly taken with her beauty; Arioldus wants to shield Eurinia, but the King commands both of them to attend at his court.
The early scenes in the play delineate two factions: the virtuous courtiers, Arioldus, Clephis, and Andrucho/Aribert, are opposed to the more amoral, cynical and self-interested courtiers, Antharis, Asprandus, and Iseas. Antharis and Clephis are old rivals; but their children, respectively son Alcidonus and daughter Selina, are in love and secretly married — though parental opposition forces them to conceal the fact and live apart. 
Timentes comes to be the play's clown substitute, its focus for broad humor. Andrucho and other courtiers convince Timentes that he is being pursued by an angry mob. To hide, Timentes climbs into an empty coffin, and faints from fear. He is thought dead, until he recovers consciousness and climbs back out of the coffin. Later, Timentes gains a false courage through drunkenness.
At court, the King attempts to seduce Eurinia; she resists and stand upon her honor, but the hot-blooded King rapes her. Arioldus learns of the crime, and faces a conflict between his personal honor and his oath of loyalty to the King. The two men confront each other over the issue — but the King is penitent, in his own limited way; he tries to repair matters by arranging a marriage between Arioldus and his sister, the princess Panopia. Arioldus rejects this; and the King offers to fight him, even providing Arioldus a pardon in advance, in case Arioldus kills him. The two are about to fight, when the eavesdropping Andrucho interrupts and prevents them.
The young lovers Alcidonus and Selina are surprised in a clandestine meeting, and separated by their fathers. Antharis, ignorant of their marriage, tries to squelch their affair by telling his son a giant lie — that Alcidonus is a bastard, and Selina's half-brother. The two lovers meet over this distressing news; believing themselves guilty of incest, they decide on suicide. They share a vial of poison. Their bodies are found, and Antharis is driven mad by the consequences of his deception. But the prudent Clephis, anticipating trouble, made sure that what the lovers thought was poison was only a sleeping potion. The lovers recover, though Antharis does not.
The drama concludes in a large revelation scene, in which Arioldus, Andrucho, and Panopia manipulate the King into a positive resolution. A faked assassination attempt reminds the King that he is not invulnerable. Andrucho is revealed as Aribert, and redeemed from banishment; Eurinia is revealed as Aribert's daughter Eugenia. Years before, the King had loved Eugenia; now, he marries her as a way of repairing the damage he has done to her. Arioldus and Panopia also marry, yielding the requisite happy ending of the tragicomic form.
Commonalities.
In having a supposedly dead body rise from its coffin, Wilson is exploiting a time-honored stage effect of English Renaissance drama. A roster of earlier instances of the trick, with no pretense to completeness, could include Marston's "Antonio and Mellida" (c. 1600), Beaumont's "The Knight of the Burning Pestle" (1607), Shakespeare's "Pericles, Prince of Tyre" (c. 1609), and several plays in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. Middleton employs a single instance of the device in "The Puritan" (c. 1607), and a doubled instance in "A Chaste Maid in Cheapside" (1613).
The moral resolution of the play, in which a rapist makes up for his crime by marrying his victim, is an abomination to modern sensibilities — but an acceptable thing to the minds of the 17th century. It occurs in other plays of the era; a notable example is found in the Fletcher collaboration "The Queen of Corinth" (c. 1617), though other instances could also be cited.

Eupatorium compositifolium

Eupatorium compositifolium commonly called Yankeeweed is a herbaceous perennial plant in Asteraceae native from North Carolina to Florida, west to Texas. Like other members of the genus "Eupatorium" it has inflorescences containing a large number of white flowers with disc florets and no ray florets, and is 0.5 to 2 metres tall.
It is closely related to "Eupatorium capillifolium" and "Eupatorium leptophyllum" and some authors consider all of them to be varieties of "E. capillifolium". However, "E. compositifolium" is not as tall as "E. capillifolium" and is found in dryer areas.
Because it is not grazed by livestock, and mostly not eaten by wildlife, it is considered undesirable in places like pastures and controlled by means such as herbicides.

Peter Joseph Arnoudt

Peter Joseph Arnoudt (or "Aernoudt", "Arnold") (born at Moere, Belgium, 17 May 1811; died at Cincinnati, 29 July 1865) was a Belgian Jesuit writer on devotional subjects.
Life.
He entered the Society of Jesus at Florissant, Missouri, in 1831. After the usual course of Jesuit training, he was appointed to teach in the colleges in the Missouri province of the Society. While engaged in teaching he proved himself to be a finished Greek scholar.
Works.
He composed in Latin the "De Imitatione Sacri Cordis Jesu". It was written to promote devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in fulfilment of a vow he had made in a time of illness. He sent the manuscript to Rome in 1846, and ten years later it was approved by Father General Roothaan. The work was published on the Benzinger press at Einsiedeln, 1863. It was translated into English by Father Fastre and published at Cincinnati in 1865. Translations were also made into French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Flemish, and Hungarian. The French translation, published at Besançon, passed through eighteen editions between the years 1864 to 1887. Sommervogel gives the titles of two English, two Flemish, and four French versions of Father Arnoudt's work.
According to Father de Smet, the well known missionary, Father Arnoudt left at his death the following manuscripts: a Greek epic poem of about 1,200 verses, a collection of Greek odes, and Greek grammar, and these ascetical works: "The Glories of Jesus", "The Delight of the Sacred Heart of Jesus", and a collection of spiritual retreats entitled "The Abode of the Sacred Heart".

Father Arnoudt's relatives in Belgium have preserved forty-six of his autograph letters.

John Ripley Forbes (25 August 1913–26 August 2006) was an American naturalist and conservationist who founded hundreds of nature museums for children in over 200 communities and thirty states. His museums were noted for noted their interactivity as children could often even borrow animals. In 1937, Forbes founded the William T. Hornaday foundation for children's museums. He was instrumental in the establishment of many prominent museums including the Kansas City Museum of History and Science. Later in his career, worried about rampant real-estate development he shifted his attention towards conservation and he founded the Southeast Land Preservation Trust in 1976. He would subsequently establish several forest preserves.

Toytown Germany

Toytown Germany is an English-language community website for Germany. It is an information resource, a meeting point, and a communication platform for English-speaking foreigners throughout the country. This moderated community is free to join, but requires registration to participate. The site is frequented by travelers and expatriates alike. It is owned and operated by The Local Europe AB, publisher of "The Local", an English-language digital news publisher with local editions in Sweden, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Norway, and Italy.
Toytown Germany, known to its users as "TT", provides information about all aspects of life in Germany and its various cities and regions, from local bar and restaurant guides with reviews to events and advice on dealing with the confusion expatriates often face when dealing with life in a new country. The site additionally includes areas for classified ads. The heart of the site is the chat forum in which English speakers discuss news, pose questions and answers, and organize social events.
Toytown Germany is partnered with major German news companies including "Der Spiegel", "Deutsche Welle", and "Die Welt". News feeds from those companies are published on the website. In return, the latest German news related discussions from the TT chat forum are published on the English news pages of "Die Welt". While those mainstream news companies provide professional reporting, Toytown Germany provides the general public with a community platform on which to discuss the latest news from Germany.
Of the approximately 230,000 native English-speaking expatriates living in Germany, the Toytown Germany statistics indicate that over 20% of these are regular readers of the website.
History.
The site was originally created in August, 2002 as "Toytown Munich". The name originates from the observation that Munich is an unusually clean, well-organised, and crime-free city, relatively free of most urban blight including graffiti and slums. In mid-2006 the site merged with Britboard, another expatriate site geared toward British expatriates in Germany. Shortly thereafter a decision was made to expand to cover all of Germany and the name was changed to reflect this.

Manufacturing operations management

Manufacturing operations management (MOM) is a methodology for viewing an end-to-end manufacturing process with a view to optimizing efficiency.
There are many types of MOM software, including for production management, performance analysis, quality and compliance, and human machine interface (HMI).

Pat Devery

Pat Devery (born August 9, 1922) is an Australian rugby league footballer of the 1940s and '50s, and coach of the 1950s. An Australian international representative half, he played in Australia for the Balmain club, winning the 1944, '46 and '47 grand finals with them. He was also the 1947 season's top point-scorer.
Devery was discovered by Latchem Robinson while playing football in The Domain, Sydney as a sailor in the Royal Australian Navy during the war.
He made his début for Australia in 1946.
At the end of the 1947 season a large number of Australians signed with English clubs, headed by Devery who signed with Huddersfield for a fee of £1,350 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £122,000 in 2009). He went on to break the club's record for most points in a season with 332, achieved in 1952–53. He also made 11-appearances for the Other Nationalities, and one appearance for the British Empire.
Devery played , i.e. number 4 in Huddersfield's 2–20 defeat to Wigan in the 1949–50 Rugby Football League Championship final at Maine Road, Manchester on Saturday 13 May 1950.
Pat Devery played , i.e. number 4 (Following a leg injury to Pat Devery, Lionel Cooper moved to , i.e. number 4, and Pat Devery moved to Left-, i.e. number 5; Lionel Cooper also took over the kicking duties from Pat Devery.) and scored a conversion in Huddersfield's 15-10 victory over St. Helens in the 1952-53 Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 25 April 1953.
He was a teacher at Oakes Elementary school in Huddersfield in the late 1940s and early 1950s at the same time as Bon Spence the former Huddersfield Town Full-back.
Devery also became a coach back in Australia, coaching the Manly-Warringah club in 1955 and 1956.

Plan Dog memo

The Plan Dog memorandum was a 1940 American government document written by Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark, "one of the best known documents of World War II". Confronting the problem of an expected two front war against Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan in the Pacific, the memo set out the main options and suggested fighting a defensive war in the Pacific while giving strategic priority to defeating Germany and Italy. The memo laid the basis for the later American policy of Europe first. 
Background.
During the Interwar period, the Joint Planning Committee (which later became the Joint Chiefs of Staff) devised a series of contingency plans for dealing with the outbreak of war with various countries. The most elaborate of these, War Plan Orange, dealt with the possibility of war with Japan. 
In light of the events of the late 1930s (the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the German conquest of Poland and Western Europe) American planners realized that the United States faced the possibility of a two-front war in both Europe and the Pacific. War Plan Orange was withdrawn, and five "Rainbow" plans were put forward. Unlike the earlier colored plans which had assumed a one-on-one war, the Rainbow plans contemplated possibility of fighting multiple enemies, and the necessity of defending other western hemisphere nations and aiding Britain.
The memorandum.
The memorandum built upon the conditions described in the Rainbow Five war plan. It described four possible scenarios for American participation in World War II, lettered A through D:
The memorandum, which was submitted to Roosevelt on November 12, 1940, recommended option D, from which it gets its name ("Dog" was D in the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet). 
"I believe that the continued existence of the British Empire, combined with building up a strong protection in our home areas, will do most to ensure the status quo in the Western Hemisphere, and to promote our principal national interests. As I have previously stated, I also believe that Great Britain requires from us very great help in the Atlantic, and possibly even on the continents of Europe or Africa, if she is to be enabled to survive. In my opinion Alternatives (A), (B), and (C) will most probably not provide the necessary degree of assistance, and, therefore, if we undertake war, that Alternative (D) is likely to be the most fruitful for the United States, particularly if we enter the war at an early date. Initially, the offensive measures adopted would, necessarily, be purely naval. Even should we intervene, final victory in Europe is not certain. I believe that the chances for success are in our favor, particularly if we insist upon full equality in the political and military direction of the war."
The memo also suggested that until hostilities broke out, the US should adopt policy A:
Until such time as the United States should decide to engage its full forces in war, I recommend that we pursue a course that will most rapidly increase the military strength of both the Army and the Navy, that is to say, adopt Alternative (A) without hostilities.
"The strategy of Plan Dog gained the support of the army and implicitly of President Roosevelt, though he never formally endorsed it. Thus at the end of 1940 a powerful consensus for strategic focus on Germany developed at the highest levels of the American government. At a meeting on January 17, 1941, Roosevelt concluded that the primary objective must be maintenance of the supply lines to Britain and ordered the navy to prepare for the escort of convoys." A few weeks after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, at the Arcadia Conference, the United States adopted the recommendations of the memo in the form of the "Europe first" policy. Although the United States did not go entirely on the defensive in the Pacific as the memo recommended, throughout the war the European theater was given higher priority in resource allocation. 
The memorandum was declassified in February, 1956.

Australian rules football culture

Australian rules football culture is the cultural aspects surrounding the game of Australian rules football, particular to Australia and the areas where it is most popular. This article explores aspects and issues surrounding the game, as well as the players, and society. Australian Rules is a sport rich in tradition and Australian cultural references, especially surrounding the rituals of gameday for players, officials, and supporters.
Popularity.
Australian rules football has attracted more overall interest among Australians (as measured by the Sweeney Sports report) than any other football code, and, when compared with all sports throughout the nation, has consistently ranked first in the winter reports, and most recently third behind cricket and swimming in summer. 
In some of the southern states, it is the most popular sport of all sports.
As a football code, it is the most popular form of football in the Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. It is less popular in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland, although there has traditionally been support for the code in regions within those states, such as parts of southern New South Wales including the Riverina and parts of Queensland such as Cairns and the Gold Coast. The AFL teams from Brisbane and Sydney attracted a strong increase in crowds and television audiences when they won four premierships between them from 2001–2005 (and appeared in Grand Finals between 2001 and 2006 inclusive), though crowds and TV ratings have both declined as both teams' performances (in particular the Brisbane Lions who have suffered a decline since losing the 2004 AFL Grand Final) in subsequent years dropped. Demographic and migration trends have affected all football codes in recent years, but most significantly Australian football in Queensland.
It is particularly popular amongst indigenous Australian communities. Indigenous Australians are well represented in professional AFL players: while only 2.4% of the population is of indigenous origin, 10% of AFL players identify themselves this way.
Australian rules is the national sport of Nauru.
Attendance.
Australian rules football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia: government figures show that more than 2.5 million people attended games in 2005-06. In 2007 (including finals matches), a cumulative 7,049,945 people attended Australian Football League premiership matches, a record for the competition. In 2005, a further 307,181 attended NAB Cup pre-season matches and 117,552 attended Regional Challenge pre-season practice matches around the country.
As of 2005 the AFL is one of only five professional sports leagues in the world with an average attendance above thirty thousand (the others are the NFL in the United States and Major League Baseball in the U.S. and Canada, and the top division soccer leagues in Germany and England). In 2007, the average attendance of 38,113 made the AFL the second best attended domestic club league in the world, after only the NFL in the United States.
The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium used for Australian rules football and the permanent home of the AFL Grand Final. It is one of the largest sporting stadiums in the world and was the venue for the record Australian rules football attendance of 121,696 at the 1970 VFL Grand Final, between Carlton and Collingwood - which game was also historic, in that it heralded the dawning of a new style of football - still largely in use today, wherein handballing was introduced more to commence the attack from the back line. Redevelopment since then to a mainly seated stadium has reduced the current capacity to approximately 100,000.
In addition to the national AFL competition, some semi-professional local leagues also draw significant crowds. Although crowds for state leagues have suffered in recent years, they continue to draw support, particularly for finals matches. The South Australian SANFL drew an attendance of 309,874 in 2006 and the Western Australian WAFL drew an official attendance of 207,154. Other leagues, such as the Victorian VFL Northern Territory Football League and the popular country league Ovens & Murray also charge admission and draw notable crowds (but with no available attendance figures).
Outside of Australia, the game has drawn notable attendances only for occasional carnival type events, such as International tests and exhibition matches.
Television.
The national AFL is the main league which is shown on television in Australia.
The 2005 AFL Grand Final was watched by a record television audience of more than 3.3 million people across Australia's five most populous cities—the five mainland state capitals—including 1.2 million in Melbourne and 991,000 in Sydney. In 2006, the national audience was 3.145 million, including 1.182 million in Melbourne and 759,000 in Sydney.
According to OzTAM, in recent years, the AFL Grand Final has reached the top five programs across the five biggest cities in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. In 2007, it was #1 in metropolitan markets. Australian rules football has achieved a #1 rating in the sports category in both 2004 and 2005.
Some of the more popular regional leagues in Australia have the "match of the week" televised locally and free-to-air on ABC Television's respective state networks. The SANFL is the most popular of these regional competitions measuring a total of 1,415,000 television viewers in 2007.
Some of these regional leagues also attracted a national audience through free-to-air broadcasting on television networks such as ABC2. OzTAM began measuring these audiences in 2006. Despite a large number of complaints, ABC2 withdrew all of these broadcasts in early 2008. However in 2010 the ABC began replaying these matches nationwide, online via the new ABC iView catch-up TV service. In 2012, the ABC commenced screening replays of the previous weekends VFL, SANFL, WAFL matches in the early hours of the morning during the week from 3.00AM - 5.30AM (local time in each state) nationwide on the ABC1 channel
Australian rules also has a nominal but growing international audience. Since 2005, some AFL matches have been shown in the pacific rim region for the first time through the Australia Network. The AFL Grand Final is broadcast to many countries and attracts many million viewers worldwide. This audience has grown to approximately 30 million viewers from 72 countries.
According to Roy Morgan Research, more Americans watch Australian Rules Football than Australians. A poll taken between April 2002 and March 2004 showed that 7,496,000 North Americans compared to 7,004,000 Australians watch Australian Rules Football at least occasionally on television.
New media.
The AFL website was the #1 most popular Hitwise Australian sports website in 2004, increasing in market share by 9.86% over that year. In 2006, other consistently high traffic websites in the Australian Top 20 included AFL Dream Team, (Trading Post) AFL Footy Tipping, BigFooty.com and Bomberland. In 2006, the search term 'afl' represented the highest number of search terms (2.48%) that delivered users to Hitwise sports category listed websites. Statistics show that Victorians consist of 43% of all visits to the AFL football category.
Team rivalries.
Rivalries are one of the main drivers in generating passionate supporter bases. 
In almost every league, there is a team which everyone loves to hate, like Collingwood, Port Adelaide and even the Southport Sharks.
The AFL in particular encourages the building of such rivalries, as a method of increasing publicity for the league, to the point of designating one round each year as "Rivalry Round" where many of these match-ups are held on the one weekend. Whilst some rivalries, such as between teams from adjacent areas are still strong, the designation of an entire round of fixtures as Rivalry Round is often criticised due to some arbitrary matchups, or ignoring stronger, more recent rivalries.
Traditions of the game.
Clothing.
As part of their uniform, players wear shirts called guernseys. Guernseys are similar to basketball shirts, but of a more robust design, often referred to in Australia as "jumpers". In the early period of the game's development players often wore sleeveless lace-up tops which gradually disappeared between the 1960s and early 1980s. A few players choose to wear a long sleeved variation of the modern guernsey design. Players wore full length pants, before adopting shorts in the 1920s. Tight-fitting shorts were a notable fashion trend in most leagues in the 1980s and some players began to wear hamstring warmers. A brief experiment with lycra by the AFL in the State of Origin series was quickly abandoned for more traditional wear. Long socks (football socks) are compulsory and boots with moulded cleats or studs for gripping the ground are worn (screw-ins have been banned from most leagues since the 1990s). Some players wear headbands or hair ties to keep the hair out of their faces when playing, though this is rare. Players will sometimes wear arm bands around their mid biceps and triceps, typically of electrical tape, in honour. Black arm bands are typically worn in memorial to someone related to the player or their club who recently died.
Traditionally, umpires have worn white and were sometimes referred to as "white maggots" amongst supporters. AFL umpires now wear bright colours to also avoid clashes with the player guernseys and AFL goal umpires now wear t-shirts and caps, rather than the traditional white coat and broad brimmed hat (similar to what was worn by many cricket umpires) which they wore before the 1990s.
Typical supporter wear includes the team scarf and sometimes beanie (particularly in cooler climates) in the colours of the team. Team guernseys are also worn by supporters. Team flags are sometimes flown by supporters at the start of a game, when a goal is scored, and when their team wins.
Gameday and crowd.
Before AFL matches, it is traditional for teams to run through a crêpe paper banner constructed by the cheersquads of each team. These often feature messages and slogans for the team in the context of the match, such as congratulating a player on a landmark number of games and more recently also sponsorship messages. The banners and sometimes also streamers are used in important local football matches such as finals. Some players are superstitious about running through the banner. As players run through the banners, the team's club song is always played. The winning clubs song is also played at the end of each match.
Australian rules supporters are said to "barrack" for their team. Though other cultures have had an influence at various points in its history, Australian football tends to have different atmosphere to sports like soccer and American football. Partly due to Australian culture, Australian rules spectators are generally more solitary animals. Despite loud shouting and arguing, crowd violence is rare. With the exception of small official cheersquads, spectators at Aussie Rules matches will rarely engage in support for their teams with organised chants, and there is often no segregation between fans. Instead, each individual spectator will most often shout their own support using the nickname of their team i.e. "Carn the Crows !" or "Carn the Maggies", or after goals perform simple chants such as "Ess-en-don! (clap-clap-clap)" or "Freo! Freo!". In contrast, cheersquads are highly organised, have their own rituals and almost always congregate behind the goals during games. The nature of the sport reflects this method of supporting. While some sports such as English or American football may involve lull periods where large chants reverberate around the ground, Australian rules football is played at a constant, frenetic pace, often leaving the crowd too immersed to take part in 'soccer style' chants. Most professional clubs have official cheersquads which will sometimes wave enormous coloured pompoms known as "floggers" after the umpire has signalled a goal. American style cheerleading is very rare.
Meat pies and beer are popular consumables (sometimes noted as a tradition) for supporters at Australian rules matches. At AFL matches mobile vendors walk around the ground selling such pies, yelling out the well-known call of "hot pies, cold drinks!"
At AAMI Stadium in Adelaide; it is tradition to have a barbecue outside the stadium, in the carpark. Many families will bring their barbecues with them. This is particularly popular during the Sunday afternoon matches.
At the end of the match, it is traditional for a "pitch invasion" to occur. Supporters run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of kick-to-kick with their families. In many suburban and country games, this also happens during quarter and half-time breaks. In the AFL in recent years, this tradition has been more strictly controlled with security guards to ensure that players and officials can safely leave the ground. At the largest AFL grounds, this tradition has been banned completely, to protect the surface, much to the discontent of fans. But most smaller regional & interstate grounds (Simonds Stadium & Sydney Showground Stadium, for example) still allow fans onto the field after the game. Sometimes a mid-game "pitch invasion" is expected for various highly anticipated landmark achievements (such as a player kicking a record number of goals).
Reading the AFL Record and recording the goals kicked by players alongside the team lists is also commonly done by spectators.
Injuries and prevention.
Australian rules football is known for its high level of physical body contact compared to other sports such as soccer and basketball. High impact collisions can occur from any direction. Unlike gridiron, padding is not mandatory and is rarely worn. Combined with the range of activity including jumping, running, kicking, twisting and turning this means that injury rates are relatively high in comparison to other sports.
Some ruckmen wear shin pads and thigh pads and players with head injuries sometimes wear soft helmets. Mouthguards are worn by most players but are only compulsory in some leagues.
Soft tissue injuries are the most frequent, including injuries to the thighs, hamstring and calf muscles. Pre-game warm-up and stretching exercises are a focus of the standard preparation routine for clubs at all levels to minimise these injuries. Osteitis pubis is a condition which particularly affects Australian rules footballers. Injuries to the knee, ankle and shoulders are also common. Hospital treated injuries, particularly for broken bones, account for 40 percent of all Australian rules football injuries.
Knee reconstructions are among the most commonly incurred career threatening injuries for both professional and amateur players, although professional players frequently continue to play after rehabilitation. Recently some professional players have undergone an innovative surgery that inserts a synthetic ligament in the knee which reduces the time out of football from twelve to three months.
Players can suffer head injuries, however spinal injuries are extremely uncommon and comparatively much lower than rugby football.
In cases of injury, players are able to be treated whilst on the ground and umpires generally only stop the play when players are removed from the ground on a stretcher. Most leagues have implemented a blood rule which forces players with bleeding wounds to leave the field for treatment until the bleeding is stopped to prevent the transmission of blood-borne disease.
Australian rules football does not have the range or severity of health issues of American football however players have been known to die whilst playing Aussie Rules, though the most common cause is heart failure. The Victorian State Coroner reported five sudden deaths in that state among Australian rules footballers aged under 38 years between 1990-1997. Three of these deaths were attributed to Ischaemic heart disease (mean age, 31.7 years), and the other two to physical trauma.
In a study conducted recently of retired VFL/AFL footballers found that the most common problems amongst the group in old age included arthritis, hip replacements and significantly reduced capacity to participate in athletic activity.
In recent years the AFL has commissioned official studies as well as introduced new rules and precautions aimed at reducing the number and severity of injuries in the sport, and there are variation games which significantly reduce the contact and risk of injury to players and allow players of any age to continue to participate.
Women.
Women have been involved in Australian football since its inception, with many early match reports remarking on the equal representation of both sexes in the crowds. The trend continues with around half of modern day AFL supporters being female, which contrasts with other codes both in Australia and overseas. For instance, only 39% of NRL (rugby league) supporters in Australia are female.
There are women's footy players and even umpires in the AFL.
However there still exist stereotypes against women and issues among football fans.
Popular culture.
For many years, the game of Australian rules football captured the imagination of Australian film, music, television and literature.
"The Club", a critically acclaimed 1977 play by David Williamson, deals with the internal politics of a Melbourne football club steeped in tradition. The play was adapted as a film, directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Jack Thompson and Graham Kennedy, in 1980.
Many songs inspired by the game have become popular, none more so than the 1979 hit "Up There Cazaly", by Mike Brady. Brady followed the hit up with "One Day in September" in 1987. Both are frequently used in Grand Final celebrations.
AFL players and the media.
Such is the obsession, particularly with that footballer's off-field behaviour is as highly scrutinized as their on field behaviour. Footballers are held by many in Australia to be role models.
Betting.
"Footy tipping" is the term for office pools where players nominate which teams will win that week. It is part of the staple office environment in Australia.
Traditionally office pools are done with footy tipping posters, however with the modern age these private competitions can be managed by PC or mobile apps.
Betting on the AFL is very popular.
Violence.
Player violence.
On-field assault has historically been socially tolerated in Australia, but, in recent years, this has changed with some players being charged by police for their on-field actions, including a recent jailing in Victoria and the much publicized case involving VFL player Leigh Matthews which ended the public perception that on-field football assaults are somehow legal. League penalties for such actions have also generally increased in recent years and overall violence has decreased over time.
Violence has also affected the International Rules Series, with the Irish team objecting to the level of violence tolerated by Australia.
Multiculturalism.
Australian rules football has involved a diverse section of society and the AFL has multicultural programs to engage people from different backgrounds.
Racial vilification.
The Australian Football League's racial vilification code is an effort to stamp out racism in the sport and it has worked well, however there has been a history of well publicised incidents in the sport.
Player Drug Abuse.
Performance enhancing drug abuse is also rare according to official studies despite some high profile recent cases and criticisms from the media and government of the AFL's own anti-doping code which allows players to test positive twice to recreational drugs and still continue to play and remain anonymous. This relaxed approach does not comply with the World Anti-Doping Agencyprotocols. The AFL code bans all drugs listed in World Anti Doping Code.
The AFL also has an illicit drugs policy.

Kawasaki YPX

The Kawasaki YPX is a new airliner proposed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan. The YPX is based on the Kawasaki P-1 aircraft now under development for the JMSDF.
Design and development.
The YPX is to seat between 100-150 passengers, and would thus be competitive with the smaller Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family jets on short haul routes. The engine choice has not been made. Entry into service is expected to be somewhere around 2015. Kawasaki hopes offer up to 15% cash operating savings over the Boeing 737-700.
According to specifications issued in 2007, the base model YPX-11 would seat 113 passengers in a two-class arrangement. The YPX-10 would seat 93 in two classes while the YPX-12 would accommodate 137, implying about 150 in an all-economy arrangement. Standard range for all three body lengths would be 4,260 km (2,300 nautical miles) but the YPX-10 and YPX-11 would have extended-range sub-variants flying as far as 5,930 km (3,200 nautical miles).
YPX would have a five-abreast economy cabin and an elliptical cross-section - that is, with a smoothly varying radius, rather than the old double-bubble based on two distinct radii. Economy seats would be 46 cm (18 in) wide; the aisle, 51 cm (20 in).

Mike Potter (baseball)

Michael Gary Potter (born May 16, 1951 in Montebello, California) is a former right-handed major league baseball outfielder who played from to for the St. Louis Cardinals.
Originally drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 3rd round of the 1970 amateur draft, Potter chose not to sign. However, when he was drafted by the Cardinals out of Mount San Antonio College in the sixth round of the secondary phase of the 1971 amateur draft, he did sign.
Potter made his major league debut on September 6, 1976, at the age of 25. Facing pitcher Steve Dunning, Potter went 0–3 with two strikeouts in his big league debut. In 16 at-bats in his first season, Potter did not collect a single hit. However, he did walk once.
He appeared in only five games in 1977, collecting no hits in seven at-bats. In total, Potter played in 14 big league games, collecting no hits in 23 at-bats. He is tied with Larry Littleton for most career at-bats by a non-pitcher without a hit.
He played his final big league game on October 2, 1977.
Potter returned to the minors to bring his professional career to a close. In the 1978 minor league season, Potter hit 22 home runs and drove in 94 RBI. On October 27, 1978, he was sent by the Cardinals to the Seattle Mariners to complete an earlier trade made on June 26, 1978. Originally, the Cardinals sent a player to be named later to the Mariners for José Báez. He hit only five home runs in 117 minor league games in 1979.

Telesoft Technologies

Telesoft Technologies (founded 1989, TsT) is a privately held UK-based limited company specializing in telephony equipment for monitoring and media applications for fixed, wireless and IP networks. Two entrepreneurs, Rob Downham and Bruce Markham, who had worked for GPT at Sopers Lane in Poole designing the original System X telephone exchange, formed the Company with the idea of revolutionizing telephone applications controlled by computer. 
Their SS7 signalling based products, coinciding with the deregulation of the UK industry, were the first to put SS7 on a single card in a stand alone PC/server. Previously SS7 infrastructure costs had been prohibitive but by driving telephony infrastructure costs lower completely new customer applications could be developed. 
Telesoft Technologies soon became known to SIs, OEMs and Telecom Operators for enabling worldwide connection between fixed, wireless and IP signalling network variants. Today their products encompass Media (voice, video etc.) and monitoring as well as the signalling solutions. Their Media products include Media Platforms/IVRs, Gateways, Converters and Programmable Switches. Monitoring products include passive monitoring probes for Lawful Interception used in Homeland Security & Intelligence and monitoring solutions for OEMs to create OSS & VAS applications (such as roaming welcome notes). It has offices in the UK, USA and India covering Europe, Americas and the Far East.

The north border of the town is the City of Tonawanda and Tonawanda Creek, which is part of the Erie Canal, and the west border is the Niagara River. Ellicott Creek flows parallel to Tonawanda Creek in the northern part of the town, with a confluence just east of the Niagara River. The east border, marked by US Route 62 (Niagara Falls Boulevard), is the Town of Amherst. Forming the southern border is the Village of Kenmore and the City of Buffalo.
History.
Formed in 1929, River Road is the smallest firematic district both in size and residences in the Town of Tonawanda. The River Road Fire District occupies a small sliver of three residential streets in an area where heavy industry surrounds its district on all sides. There are several major industrial points of interest in the Fire Protection District #1 area including the Dunlop Tire Plant, Dupont Chemical Plant, FMC, 3M, GM Powertrain Plant and the NRG Huntley Power Plant. This abundance of heavy industry showcases the necessity for a fire station in this heavily industrial area of the town.
The River Road Fire Company was quartered at 59 Kaufman Avenue in a cramped two-bay station which was originally built in 1929. The station had showed its age and was in desperate need of replacement. Last year the fire company moved into a state of the art two bay station built across the street from the old fire hall. As well, River Road purchased from the Brighton Fire District their old Engine 6 which has replaced River Road's aged Engine 1. 
In the 90s the membership had shrunk to the point where there was talk of disbanding River Road or merging them into another town fire company.
However since 2002 membership at the River Road Fire Company has grown.
Firematic Calls.
Since the district that River Road protects is so small, the amount of calls responded to within that district are minimal. River Road does respond to the area known as Old Town, a residential area adjacent to the GM Powertrain Plant as well as bordering the City of Buffalo's Riverside neighborhood.
However, most calls in the area of the River Road Fire District are classified Fire Protection District 1 with a full response from all town and village fire companies.
Emergency Medical Services.
River Road as with all town companies does not respond to EMS calls with the exception of the Village of Kenmore Fire Department. All EMS Calls are handled by the Town of Tonawanda Police Department's Paramedic Unit, which operates a total of three fly-cars. Patrols 44,47,and 49 respectively are the Paramedic response vehicles. Patients are transported via Twin City Ambulance.
Milestones.
Due to extensive work by two of the firemen in the company Bernard S Misiura Jr (President of the organization 2008–????) and Jason Webb (Lieutenant 2008–????) a law was passed regarding membership limitations. This law was achieved with help from the honorable State Senator Mary Lou Rath and the Honorable State Assemblyman Robin Schimminger with thanks to Governor David A Paterson (David Paterson).
Specifically this law amends through exempting River Road Fire District #3 from subdivision 7 of section 176-b, of Town Law that mandates Fire Districts to have no more than forty-five Percent non-resident membership.
The Governor David A Paterson (David Paterson) signed this proposed bill into law on July 21, 2008.
The Ladies Auxiliary, after being disbanded for over 20 years, was officially resurrected in September 2008. This was one of the goals that President Misiura wanted to achieve in his term.

Lattice-based cryptography

Lattice-based cryptography is the generic term for asymmetric cryptographic primitives based on lattices. 
History.
Lattices were first studied by mathematicians Joseph Louis Lagrange and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Lattices have been used recently in computer algorithms and in cryptanalysis. In 1996, Miklós Ajtai showed in a seminal result the use of lattices as a cryptography primitive.
Mathematical background.
A lattice "L" is a set of points in the "n"-dimensional Euclidean space R"n" with a strong periodicity property. A basis of "L" is a set of vectors such that any element of "L" is uniquely represented as their linear combination with integer coefficients. When "n" is at least 2, each lattice has infinitely many different bases. 
Mathematical problems are used to construct a cryptography system. These problems are usually hard to solve unless one has extra information. Mathematical problems based on lattices are the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP). "SVP": Given a basis of a lattice, find the shortest vector in the lattice. "CVP": Given a basis of a lattice and a vector not in the lattice, find the lattice vector with the least distance to the first vector.
These problems are normally hard to solve. There are algorithms to solve these problems with a good basis. 
Lattice basis reduction is a transformation of an integer lattice basis in order to find a basis with short, nearly orthogonal vectors. If one can compute such a lattice basis, the CVP and SVP problems are easy to solve. A good basis reduction algorithm is the LLL algorithm.
Lattice-based cryptosystems.
In 2009, Craig Gentry using lattice-based cryptography showed the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme as announced by IBM on June 25. His scheme supports evaluations of arbitrary depth circuits.
Security issues.
Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography. Many of them are quite efficient, and some even compete with the best known alternatives; they are typically quite simple to implement; and are all believed to be secure against attacks using conventional or quantum computers.
In terms of security, lattice-based cryptographic constructions can be divided into two types. The first includes practical proposals, which are typically very efficient, but often lack a supporting proof of security. The second type admits strong provable security guarantees based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems, but only a few of them are sufficiently efficient to be used in practice. 
Worst-case hardness.
Worst-case hardness of lattice problems means that breaking the cryptographic construction (even with some small non-negligible probability) is provably at least as hard as solving several lattice problems (approximately, within polynomial factors) in the worst case. In other words, breaking the cryptographic construction implies an efficient algorithm for solving any instance of some underlying lattice problem. In most cases, the underlying problem is that of approximating lattice problems such as SVP to within polynomial factors, which is conjectured to be a hard problem. Such a strong security guarantee is one of the distinguishing features of lattice-based cryptography.
The importance of the worst-case security guarantee is twofold. First, it assures us that attacks on the cryptographic construction are likely to be effective only for small choices of parameters and not asymptotically. In other words, it assures us that there are no fundamental flaws in the design of our cryptographic construction. In fact, in some cases, the worst-case security guarantee can even guide us in making design decisions. Second, in principle the worst-case security guarantee can help us in choosing concrete parameters for the cryptosystem, although in practice this leads to what seems like overly conservative estimates and one often sets the parameters based on the best known attacks.
Quantum algorithms and lattices.
Lattice problems are typically quite hard. The best known algorithms either run in exponential time, or provide quite bad approximation ratios. The field of lattice-based cryptography has been developed based on the assumption that lattice problems are hard. There are currently no known quantum algorithms for solving lattice problems that perform significantly better than the best known classical (i.e., non-quantum) algorithms. This is despite the fact that lattice problems seem like a natural candidate to attempt to solve using quantum algorithms: because they are believed not to be NP-hard for typical approximation factors, because of their periodic structure, and because the Fourier transform, which is usually exploited in quantum algorithms, is tightly related to the notion of lattice duality.
Attempts to solve lattice problems by quantum algorithms have been made since Shor’s discovery of the quantum factoring algorithm in the mid-1990s, but have so far met with little success if any at all.

Centre de Morphologie Mathématique (or Center of Mathematical Morphology, or CMM) is a research center of the "École des Mines de Paris", France, devoted to the research and promotion of mathematical morphology. It was created in 1968 as a result of the works of Georges Matheron and Jean Serra, who were hired as its first director and assistant director, respectively. 
In 1979, the center was renamed Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique, reflecting its increased scope. In 1986, the part related to geostatistics split into an independent center ("Centre de Géostatistique"), still directed by Matheron. Serra was named the directory of the new CMM. 
The CMM is located at Fontainebleau, France, and is currently directed by Fernand Meyer.

Drug repositioning

Drug repositioning (also known as Drug repurposing, Drug re-profiling, Therapeutic Switching and Drug re-tasking) is the application of known drugs and compounds to new indications (i.e., new diseases).
Drug repositioning.
Drug repositioning has been growing in importance in the last few years as an increasing number of drug development and pharmaceutical companies see their drug pipelines drying up and realize that many previously promising technologies have failed to deliver ‘as advertised’. 
Using drug repositioning, pharmaceutical companies have achieved a number successes, for example Pfizer's Viagra in erectile dysfunction and Celgene's thalidomide in severe erythema nodosum leprosum. Smaller companies, including Ore Pharmaceuticals, Biovista, Numedicus, Melior Discovery and Biotech are also performing drug repositioning on a systematic basis. These companies use a combination of approaches including in silico biology and in vivo/in vitro experimentation to assess a compound and develop and confirm hypotheses concerning its usage for new indications. There is a not-for-profit headquartered in the Chicago area called Cures Within Reach that focuses on generic drug repurposing and has supported the creation of repurposed treatments for the rare diseases autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and familial dysautonomia.
A significant advantage of drug repositioning over traditional drug development is that since the repositioned drug has already passed a significant number of toxicity and other tests, its safety is known and the risk of failure for reasons of adverse toxicology are reduced. More than 90% of drugs fail during development, and this is the most significant reason for the high costs of pharmaceutical R&D. In addition, repurposed drugs can bypass much of the early cost and time needed to bring a drug to market. On the other hand drug repositioning faces some challenges itself since the intellectual property issues surrounding the original drug may be complex and from a commercial point of view it may not always make sense to take such a drug to market.
One notable example of drug repurposing is taking the partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine - which has been prescribed for control of moderate pain for decades in low dosages in the form of Temgesic 200mcg sublingual tablets, Buprenex 300mcg/mL ampoules - and marketing a high-dosage formulation (Subutex 2 mg and 8 mg) for the interruption and maintenance of heroin and other opioid addictions, which it has proven very beneficial for, with over 200,000 people in the United States alone on buprenorphine maintenance. Some of the reasons for this are that the drug has a ceiling effect - higher doses do not cause further activation of opioid receptors - and a very long half-life in >2 mg dosages. It also has an extremely high binding affinity for opioid receptors, which keeps the drug from being displaced by opioids like Dilaudid, heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, with the result that a user maintained on it can not get high no matter what dosage taken of most opioids. The only opioids that may be able to break through the buprenorphine blockade (which are required in an acute-care setting if a buprenorphine patient requires pain relief, as no standard opioids are strong enough) - drugs with similar or higher binding affinities to buprenorphine itself - are the fentanil-class opioids, and the Bentley-series opioids (cf. etorphine, dihydroetorphine), which are rarely primary drugs of abuse and not often found on the streets. Buprenorphine itself is a modified Bentley-series opioid.
Requip is another notable example of drug repurposing. Originally developed as an anti-Parkinsonian agent, it has found application in the treatment of both Restless Legs Syndrome and SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.
Colesevelam is another example of drug repurposing. Originally developed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia as monotherapy, it has also gained approval to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Another example of drug repurposing is that of gabapentin, and its chemical cousin pregabalin. Originally developed as anti-epileptics, they have found more use treating anxiety disorders and neuropathic pain than as seizure medications.

Hero Beauregard Fiennes-Tiffin (born 6 November 1997) is an English actor best known for his role as the 11-year-old Tom Riddle, the young version of antagonist Lord Voldemort, in "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", the sixth installment of the "Harry Potter" films.
Early life.
Fiennes-Tiffin was born on the 6th November 1997 in London, England to film directors George Tiffin and Martha Fiennes. 
Career.
Fiennes-Tiffin made his first film appearance as Spartak in the 2008 drama, "Bigga Than Ben". Fiennes-Tiffin earned the part of young Voldemort even though thousands of young actors auditioned for the role; at least one publication, however, has alleged his family relation alone landed him the part. David Yates, director of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", said Fiennes-Tiffin was cast as Tom Riddle due to his ability to find "the darker space" in his line readings. Yates said he did not get the role due to his relation to Ralph Fiennes, who was his maternal uncle, but admitted the family resemblance was "a clincher". Yates described the actor as "very focused and disciplined" and said he "got the corners and dark moods and odd spirit of the character" and had a "wonderful haunted quality that seemed to bring Tom Riddle alive on-screen for us."
Personal life.
Fiennes-Tiffin lives in South London with his mother and his older brother Titan and his younger sister Mercy. He attends Emanuel School.

Life.
Akal moved to Canada in 1999 and obtained Canadian citizenship. In 2003 he left Windsor, Ontario and returned to Palestine to look for a wife, and became acquainted with Mohammed Bashir Abut Matar, who urged him to avenge the death of his cousin at Israeli military hands.
Arrest and sentencing.
Akal was arrested November 1, 2003, several days after arriving in the Gaza strip. His lawyer Jamil al-Qatib complained that any information stemming from his 20-hour-a-day interrogations over a period of two weeks was useless.
Pleading guilty on November 24, he said that he had been counseled by Ahmed Wahabe to follow an unnamed Israeli politician touring the United States, and raise funds in North American mosques to purchase an M16 rifle with which to launch a sniper attack, killing the target. He also claimed that he had been told to attribute the attack to al-Qaeda, rather than Hamas; while Hamas denied any knowledge of Akal, stating that they limited all their actions to the Palestinian region.
Akal was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by the military court, and was released back to Canada in August 2007.

Bauer Type Foundry

The Bauer Type Foundry was a German type foundry founded in 1837 by Johann Christian Bauer in Frankfurt am Main. Noted typeface designers, among them Lucian Bernhard, Konrad Friedrich Bauer (not related to the company's founder), Walter Baum, Heinrich Jost, Imre Reiner, Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler, Emil Rudolf Weiß, and Heinrich Wienyck, designed typefaces for the company.
The company nearly went bankrupt at the end of the 19th century because the company's administration assumed that type founding, rather than typesetting, would be automated. The new owner, Georg Hartmann, succeeded in saving the company. Subsequently, the company grew, also due to several takeovers, "e.g." in 1916 by Frankfurt's type foundry Flinsch, itself a global player. In 1927, an office was opened in New York.
In 1972, all activities of the headquarters in Frankfurt were stopped and transferred to the former subsidiary company, "Fundición Tipográfica Neufville" in Barcelona, which still owns the rights to many typefaces. These are distributed by the English company, "Neufville Digital", amongst others.
Typefaces.
